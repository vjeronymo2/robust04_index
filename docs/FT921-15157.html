			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / Miyazawa cautions on US trade hopes MR Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, warned yesterday that it would take time before the measures agreed by him and President Bush would diminish the imbalance in trade. He said the president's visit, which ended yesterday, would lead to an improvement in bilateral relations. However, he said: 'Japan is a country with a market economy and we can't manipulate these (trade) numbers.' Mr Miyazawa's cautious tone, in a speech in Tokyo, was in line with Mr Bush's own view that the economic agreements were 'a significant but interim step' in achieving better balance in bilateral trade. The comments indicate that the US might launch fresh trade initiatives in coming months, especially if Mr Bush comes under more pressure to get tough with Japan. The agreements reached during the president's visit which ended yesterday cover various industries, including cars. Under great pressure, Japanese car companies agreed to increase from Dollars 9bn in 1990 to Dollars 19bn in the 1994 fiscal year their purchases of US-made parts. This includes imports into Japan and local procurement in the US. The Japanese companies also agreed to increase the local content of their US-made cars from 50 per cent to 70 per cent and to increase imports of finished cars from the US by up to 20,000 vehicles. However, Japanese officials and industry executives still believe that the US needs to make more efforts in the Japanese market. Mr Noboru Hatakeyama, the international affairs vice-minister at the ministry of trade and industry, said yesterday that the US had to cut consumption, increase its competitiveness and raise its commitment to exporting. The Japanese Export-Import Bank, a government institution, is considering making a low-interest loan to a US company to help it export to Japan. An Exim bank official said it was the first case of the bank lending for this purpose. The bank's normal role is to help exports by Japanese companies to developing countries. The planned loan to a US company indicates how seriously the government views the bilateral trade imbalance. The planned recipient of the loan, believed to be about Y200m, is a medium-sized electronics company in Florida. A court yesterday set an important precedent for equality in the Japanese workplace by ordering a bank to recognise that women can be the head of a household and have an equal entitlement to family allowances, writes Robert Thomson in Tokyo. Sendai High Court ruled that the Iwate Bank had unfairly halted family allowance payments to an employee - a supplement on salary for spouse and children - after her unemployed husband found a job. The bank argued that though Mrs Reiko Sugawara had registered as household head, it was generally understood among Japanese that a man is the family head.</p>

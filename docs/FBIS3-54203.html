The  national conference crowns numerous rounds of talks in the  framework of a national dialogue. Various political and social  forces took part in this dialogue, except representatives of the  dissolved Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] which the National  Dialogue Commission had promised to involve in the last round of  talks. However, nothing has been revealed yet on the results of  the contacts which the Dialogue Commission has held with the FIS.    On the eve of the start of the national consensus  conference,  numerous political parties continue to announce their  participation in this conference. Thus the Islamic Society  Movement, HAMAS [Islamic Resistance Movement], has announced its  participation. The leader of the movement, Mr. Mahfouz Nahnah,  said at a press conference that the participation of his party  was aimed at achieving several objectives, one of which was to  contribute to the containment of the current crisis. Mr.  Mahfouz Nahnah explains these objectives to our colleague Ahmed  Khida:    [Begin Nahnah recording] The executive bureau of HAMAS  movement, which has been appointed by the movement's national  consultative council, has decided to take part in the national  conference in order to achieve the following objectives:    1. To contribute effectively to the containment of Algeria's  stifling crisis.    2. To find suitable and practical formulas which would  lead to the legitimacy with the drawing up of an agenda for the  next elections.    3. To discuss formulas aimed at tackling the security  crisis and find ways to ensure political detente through  political means.    4. To expose the conspiracies, the manipulations and the  methods aimed at excluding some people, aggravating the crisis  and maintaining the status quo in the service of narrow  interests, be they the interests of the authorities or those of  the parties. Narrow interests are pursued at the expense of the  blood of the innocent people, their property, and honor and at  the expense of the country's higher interest. [end recording]</p>

			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Indian reserves at record Dollars 13bn India's gold and foreign exchange reserves have hit a record Dollars 13bn (Pounds 8.7bn), reflecting the improved economic outlook for the world's 12th largest economy, Reuter reports from Bombay. The Reserve Bank of India yesterday said the country's gold and foreign currency reserves had reached Dollars 13.01bn on December 17, up from Dollars 8.9bn a year ago. Bankers said the Reserve Bank was taking in up to Dollars 100m a day as part of its decision to hold the rupee at around 31.37 to the dollar. On the day the government faced demands in parliament for the resignation of Finance Minister Manmohan Singh for failing to prevent last year's securities scandal, bankers and economists said the improved economy reflected the liberalisation policies of Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao. 'The overall economy is moving out of recession. The underlying trend is buoyant,' said Mr Narayanan Vaghul, chairman of ICICI, a leading Indian financial institution. But some core sectors, such as steel and cement, dependent on government expenditure, remained depressed because of spending cuts. The government projects growth in real gross domestic product in the current fiscal year, ending in March, at 4.5 per cent, up from 4 per cent last year and 1.3 per cent in 1991-92. India's economic reforms have started attracting the attention of overseas investors, with Dollars 3bn in investment approvals since Mr Rao took power.</p>

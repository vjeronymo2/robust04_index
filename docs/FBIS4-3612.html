			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Victoria Finlay and So Lai-Fun] </F>   [Text] Amnesty International yesterday accused the Hong  Kong Government of failing to safeguard human rights. It also  called for the immediate establishment of an independent human  rights commission. But Governor Chris Patten believes a  commission might be a "pretty toothless creature."    In its first comprehensive report on the territory for four  years, Amnesty claimed Hong Kong fell short of its minimum  obligations to provide an effective complaints system for people  who believed they were victims of violations of the Bill of  Rights.    "People in Hong Kong have been priced out of the market,"  said international law expert Chris Avery, who compiled the  report. He said people claiming the Government had violated  their rights were often deterred from bringing a civil case by  the fear that, should they lose the case, they would be ordered  to pay the "often huge" costs. "Many people feel they must  simply let their rights be violated rather than risk financial  ruin trying to enforce them in court."    Mr Avery was very surprised there had been only 15  applications for legal aid in civil Bill of Rights cases, with  the exception of immigration cases which were treated  separately. Only one application had been granted and two  applications had been withdrawn.    Legal Aid Department spokesman Andrew Leung Kin-pong said  all  cases were dealt with on an independent basis. He said there  was a comprehensive appeal procedure.    The report called for the Government to make the legal aid  agency fully independent and also to set up a human rights  commission to provide an "accessible, affordable, speedy and  effective remedy" for victims of human rights violations. Mr  Avery said the Legislative Council [Legco] had already voted for  a commission, but Mr Patten had not spoken in its favour.    Mr Patten, speaking during Legco question time yesterday,  said the administration would look at the pros and cons of the  suggestion before stating its position by the end of June. He  added: "One can think of some human rights commissions which  are pretty toothless creatures and perhaps at the end of the day  do less for the advance of human rights than could have been  achieved in other ways."    Legislator Anna Wu Hung-yuk, the sponsor of a private  member's bill on the commission, described the Governor's  attitude as "empty- minded" and aimed at preserving the status  quo.    Senior law lecturer at Hong Kong University, Dr Nihal  Jayawickrama, said he agreed with the recommendations of the  45-page Amnesty report, Hong Kong and Human Rights: Flaws in  the System.    He said the Bill of Rights had been introduced by the  Government in 1991 as a confidence-boosting measure after the  Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989. "They seemed to say that now  they had got the Bill of Rights, they would be able to leave it  alone, without introducing the necessary safeguards." But he  said the commission provided those safeguards.    Meanwhile, more than 70 members of the United States House  of  Representatives have written urging Mr Patten to set up a  commission.</p>

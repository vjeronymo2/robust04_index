			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow February 26 TASS -- The third meeting of the  Russian Federation Council, which lasted for only three days,  has shown "the chamber proceeds from the urgent needs and its  ability to help the reforms with laws," Council Speaker Vladimir  Shumeyko told an exclusive ITAR-TASS interview.    A reason for active work of the chamber is the "absence of  factionalism and division on party principle. It is not  important for us who suggests a proposal if the latter is good,"  he said.    In the words of Shumeyko, the presidential message to the  Federal Assembly will be discussed at a council plenary  scheduled for March 15. The deputies have discussed some  problems related to the message, including a resolution on  measures against crime in the Russian Federation.    The deputies believe that order is even more important than  the economic reform. In their opinion, it is a "comprehensive  problem that starts from the question of power". They favor the  creation of a solid system of vertical power in order to control  implementation of resolutions.    Shumeyko thinks that anti-crime measures include aspects of  the economic reform. While the old system has been ruined and a  new one has not been formed, the use of laws to expand criminal  activities should be prevented.    These also include the border issue which is to be settled  by  the Federation Council. Unestablished borders enable any person  to penetrate into the Russian Federation and carry arms or drugs.    The introduction of a state of emergency is another  prerogative of the upper parliament chamber. A lot of arms have  been accumulated in the state of emergency zones, which also  results in the increased crime rate. Shumeyko does not exclude  parliamentary hearings on enhanced measures against crime may  result in the parliament's proposal to the president to  introduce the state of emergency in some Russian areas in order  to remove arms from the residents.</p>

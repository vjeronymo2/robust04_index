			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (2): Pulling Xerox back from the brink PROPHETS IN THE DARK by David Kearns and David Nadler Harper Business, Dollars 22.50, 334 pages IT WAS CALLED the Cinderella story of US business in the 1960s when this small, undistinguished maker of photographic paper, with an odd-sounding name, pioneered the modern office copying machine and became one of America's fastest growing companies. Yet by the early 1980s Xerox was in danger of a demise as dramatic as its growth had been. Weakened by executive infighting, anti-trust legal battles and a complacent disregard for its customers, it was losing ground to Japanese rivals. Its share of the copier market had dropped from more than 90 per cent in the early 1970s to less than 15 per cent. It was this burden that David Kearns inherited when he became chief executive in 1982. He realised that, while Xerox still seemed healthy to the outside world, 'if nothing were done to correct things, we were destined to have a fire sale and close down by 1990.' This book tells the remarkable story of how Kearns and his fellow managers turned Xerox into one of the few US companies ever to win back market share from the Japanese. An important role was played by Kearns' co-author, David Nadler, head of a small management consultancy hired to help with the turn-round, who is now one of America's leading young management gurus. Kearns retired from Xerox in 1990 and became US Deputy Secretary of Education. Xerox's revival, and this book, are monuments to the tenets of the 'total quality' movement which began to penetrate US and European management systems in the 1980s. The idea, which originated with US management thinkers but was first put to practical use by Japanese companies, is that a company must seek the highest quality in everything it does and have as its first goal the total satisfaction of customers' needs. It is easy to pronounce such pat prescriptions. But putting them into practice across complex business organisations is extremely difficult - a fact underlined by the many cases of companies which have abandoned such schemes, disillusioned at their lack of progress. What lessons for the total quality movement does the Kearns/Nadler tale hold? Probably the most important is the need for total commitment from the very top. As Kearns admits: 'Many of our managers didn't think this quality push was any more than some sort of top management fantasy. An amazing amount of people thought this was a crummy idea or that I and the others supporting it were silly. But once I had begun to believe that Xerox was on its way out of business, I was ready to go hammer and tongs after quality.' Key allies in this battle included two senior, but maverick executives, who realised both the importance of the quality push and the political importance of recruiting a core of influential managers who would ensure a 'constituency of support in the right places.' Nadler's role was also crucial. An organisations expert, he had a close and long-lasting relationship with Kearns, who found it invaluable to have a sounding board he trusted from outside the organisation. Over a period of four years Xerox put its 100,000 employees through quality programmes, and Kearns believes the approach it adopted is one of the company's most important contributions to the quality movement. Senior executives were trained first, so the system cascaded down from the top, but managers then had to teach the course to others, which made them more attentive and drummed quality ideas into them twice. Employees were also trained with the people they worked with every day, allowing them to apply their new tools to collective problems. The revival of Xerox involved plenty of mistakes, many of which Kearns recounts, and took much longer than even he expected to start producing results. He points out that in late 1986, nearly four years into the programme, 'we began to sense that Leadership Through Quality was teetering on the brink. With a little shove it could have gone over the precipice.' A reassessment, some fine tuning and a renewed push from the top followed, and by 1988 Xerox's quality was improving by leaps and bounds. The weakest part of the narrative is the explanation for this sudden transformation, with the authors citing frustratingly few concrete examples of individual quality initiatives. Nevertheless, this is a refreshingly jargon-free and easily digestible analysis of one of America's most important recent corporate rescues. It is essential reading for any student of total quality management.</p>

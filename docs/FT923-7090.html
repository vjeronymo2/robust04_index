			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Exam results TODAY, HUNDREDS of thousands of UK school leavers will learn the results of their A-level examinations. Their future prospects - in higher or further education and the careers of their choice - will often depend upon the results. The headline news that entries and pass rates have again risen is cheering, but it cannot conceal the unacceptable damage which the A-level exam continues to inflict on the education system in England and Wales. The A-level exam is a highly refined procedure which successfully selects a small minority of students to go on to university degree courses, which reach a world-beating standard in just three years. The hurdle is necessarily set high, to screen out the three out of four young people for whom there are no university places. For that majority, there are various post-16 technical and vocational qualifications which - despite government reforms - are still a long way from enjoying 'parity of esteem' with academic qualifications among pupils, parents or employers. For those permitted to attempt the A-level hurdle, the penalty for failure is high. One in five entries results in a fail grade, leaving the candidate with nothing to show for two years' intensive study of the subject. Even the successful entrants must bend to the system's iron determination to impose premature and excessive specialisation: the brightest and best are encouraged to become scientists and engineers who cannot communicate, or arts specialists who can barely calculate percentages. Moves to broaden post-16 education have been resisted by ministers, who have been concerned to defend what they describe as the 'gold standard' of A-levels. The only concession has been the creation of AS-levels, examinations which aim to reach the standard of A-levels with around half the content. While these offer the opportunity for young people to take more subjects in the sixth form, they have not proved popular with either pupils or schools (which find them hard to timetable). This year, there were fewer than 53,000 entries, compared with more than 730,000 at A-level: the AS-level has clearly failed to catch on. A broader curriculum is necessary, drawing on the excellent and proven model of the International Baccalaureate. IB students take six subjects, with mathematics, English and a foreign language compulsory. Three subjects are followed at a higher level and three as subsidiaries, with the final grade depending on performance in all six. Whether this broader approach is adopted as part of a system which encompasses similar standards in technical and vocational education (as the French baccalaureate does) is a secondary matter. But the creation of a compatible system which provides a convincing range of qualifications suited to all talents and disciplines is long overdue.</p>

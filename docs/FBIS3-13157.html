			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sha'ul Rehavi] </F>   [Text] A new report by the Betzelem Organization regarding  law enforcement on settlers in the territories states, among  other things, that the law enforcement authorities and the  courts tend to be charitable when dealing with Jewish settlers  who caused the death of Palestinians. The report, drafted by  Eytan Palner, will be published next week.    According to Betzelem, from the beginning of the intifadah  until the Hebron massacre, there were 62 incidents of  Palestinian deaths caused by settlers in the territories. The  report provides the following breakdown: 15 cases in 1988; 17  in 1989; nine in 1990; six in 1991; 1 in 1992; and 14 in 1993.    During the same period, 13 settlers trials have been  completed. Only one ended with the settler being convicted of  murder, and this case is currently being appealed to the Supreme  Court. In the other trials, the courts ruled causing death by  negligence (6), manslaughter (1), or rioting (1), issued a  sentence of admission to a psychiatric hospital (one person  charged with two killings), and two settlers were acquitted.    It is worth noting that in his testimony before the  commission of inquiry into the Hebron massacre yesterday,  Central Command Commander Dani Yatom said that, as far as he can  recall, there were one or two incidents in which settlers killed  Palestinians over the past several years, and only one case was  brought to trial.</p>

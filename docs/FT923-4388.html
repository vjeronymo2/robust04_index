			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Militant farmers sow discord - French smallholders fear for livelihood MR Jacques Laigneau, a cereal producer in south-western France, is typical of the thousands of French farmers who believe their livelihood will be wrecked by the Maastricht treaty on European union. For Mr Laigneau, 58, Maastricht will bring 'US food, Chinese clothes, Japanese cars and French unemployment'. It will turn France into a 'dustbin for cheap US cattlefeed', he claims, spreading his meaty hands in despair. Just why Mr Laigneau believes this is so illustrates an important point in France's agonising over its European future in the run-up to the September 20 referendum. For, like many No voters, his objections are complex and wide-ranging; only partly based on the details of the Maastricht plan itself. Mr Laigneau admits to being motivated by a general fear of being trampled in a Europe ruled by free-market forces, in which national governments will have little power to help victims of open competition. Mr Laigneau represents one of the toughest layers in the bedrock of anti-Maastricht opinion in France. He is president and a founder member of Coordination Rurale, the extreme splinter group of 10,000 mainly small farmers. The group, which represents a tiny minority of French farmers, was formed last December in protest against mainstream agricultural unions' acceptance of the principle of European Community agriculture policy reforms. Coordination Rurale achieved notoriety early this summer when it organised tractor road blocks across motorways in protest against EC price cuts and cheap imports from Eastern Europe. This was the predecessor of the much more damaging nationwide blockade later imposed by the truckers, another group in which anti-EC feeling runs strong. Over the next fortnight, Coordination Rurale will continue its campaign. Tractors will crawl towards Paris at snail's pace on busy roads from seven corners of France, towing dustbins loaded with copies of the treaty. The group is also planning to send several hundred farmers to distribute anti-Maastricht tracts and to lobby in the streets of the capital in the final week before the referendum. Mr Laigneau enumerates his concrete objections to the treaty as he perches on a plywood chair in the dingy warehouse that forms the Coordination Rurale's headquarters west of Toulouse. He accepts that Coordination Rurale's main aim - to try to overturn the cereals and meat price cuts agreed by EC member states earlier this year - has no direct link with the Maastricht treaty. However, Mr Laigneau knows the treaty well and points to the clauses pledging to work towards open European markets and free competition. These will only reinforce agriculture policy reforms and spell the death of 'European preference', by which Mr Laigneau means European consumers' obligation to buy European agriculture produce, even at production prices well above world levels. French farmers need this protection because they cannot compete on equal terms against the cheapest world producers. 'Competition against other Europeans is OK, because we are competing against people with a similar culture and standard of living,' he explains. Coordination Rurale also shares other Maastricht opponents' fears of perceived domination by the Brussels bureacracy and German influence, he adds. 'It is like the prospect of marriage. If you say Yes, it is irreversible, but if you say No, you can still rethink. And you don't marry a woman who makes you frightened,' he says. Many members of the mainstream agriculture unions, like the FNSEA, share the Coordination Rurale's general fears of European union. Like the Coordination Rurale, the FNSEA comes mainly from the right wing, where sensitivity about loss of sovereignty is strong. But the FNSEA believes the Coordination Rurale's opposition to the price cuts is unrealistic and that French agriculture must face up to a measure of international competition - a theme implicit in the treaty. Mr Laigneau has no time for this argument, nor for the recent reminder by Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, that French farming would in the long term suffer even more without the reforms. The Coordination Rurale represents those farms hardest hit by the reduction in EC price support, so it can be expected to take a hard line, says Mr Laigneau. It is no accident that the movement was born in the south-west, a region dotted with poor smallholders, in contrast to the large farms of the fertile Paris basin, where the FNSEA is strong. Take his own case. Mr Laigneau is well off by the standards of most of his members, with a cereals farm of 105 hectares. Yet he has seen his annual net income dwindle from FFr200,000 (Pounds 21,000) to a mere FFr50,000 (Pounds 5,250) over the past three years, thanks to a halving in prices and steep rise in costs over the period. He expects to be out of business in another two years if the trend continues. Many of his neighbours have tried to diversify into quality farm goods like foie gras or melons, but have found the price competition as tough there as as on their original production. 'Diversification is a trap,' says Mr Laigneau. Faced with that problem, it is understandable that Coordination Rurale's members feel cornered.</p>

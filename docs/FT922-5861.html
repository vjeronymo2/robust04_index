			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Canadian grain for Moscow hit by cash shortage CANADIAN grain exports to Russia have slowed to a trickle because of Moscow's inability to pay foreign shipowners and a ban imposed by Ottawa on many Russian-owned vessels to counter an infestation of leaf-eating moths. Russia's shortage of hard currency has already caused Canadian authorities to impound at least one fully-laden vessel, and appears to be discouraging other owners from sending ships to Canadian ports. The slowdown in shipments to Canada's biggest grain export market has also caused a domestic transport crisis. About half the grain freighters plying the Great Lakes are at present idle. Estimates of June exports were cut yesterday. Total shipments through the Great Lakes port of Thunder Bay are now projected at 0.5m tonnes, half the volume expected a month ago.</p>

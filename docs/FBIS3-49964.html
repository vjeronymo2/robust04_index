It is necessary to exert equal pressure  on all sides in order to have affect on the negotiations,  Yarokostopoulos said in an interview to the Zagreb weekly GLOBUS.    He pointed out that the United Nations wished to exert  political pressure on Serbia with the sanctions and that their  effect on the overall economy in this Yugoslav republic was  obvious. However, the question is whether the political goal  because of which the sanctions were introduced has been achieved  or have the sanctions proved to be useless in this respect, he  added.    The U.N. Security Council introduced comprehensive and  mandatory sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  (Serbia and Montenegro) at the end of May 1992 accusing  Yugoslavia of aggression against the former Yugoslav Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The U.N. Security Council did this ignoring  the fact that a civil war among local Moslems, Serbs and Croats  has been underway since April 1992 and that there are no  Yugoslav Army troops there.    The head of the EU monitoring mission for the former  Yugoslavia said it was wrong to think that the sanctions against  the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia should remain in force until  the problems in areas under U.N. Protection (UNPA) in the former  Yugoslav Republic of Croatia are solved.    The republic of Serb Krajina (RSK) is a UNPA. The RSK was  proclaimed on predominantly Serb populated areas in former  Croatia in response to Croatia's forcible secession from the  former Yugoslavia and its attempt to limit civil and national  rights of the Serbian people. Although the RSK has been under  U.N. protection since spring 1992, the Croatian Army launched  three aggressions on it since then in an attempt to forcibly  establish its authority there.    The sanctions are linked to a concrete political problem and  that is Bosnia-Herzegovina, Yarokostopoulos said and assessed  the sanctions would be lifted once the war there was stopped.</p>

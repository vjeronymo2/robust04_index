			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Taiwan relaxes bank curbs Taiwan says it has further relaxed curbs on foreign banks' operations on the island in a bid to enhance its application to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Laura Tyson reports from Taipei. The finance ministry said the changes would enhance foreign banks' efficiency and service in Taiwan, as well as further the government's oft-stated goal of developing Taipei into a regional financial centre. A ceiling on Taiwan-dollar-denominated deposits held by foreign bank branches, set at 15 times the branch's capitalisation, has been lifted.</p>

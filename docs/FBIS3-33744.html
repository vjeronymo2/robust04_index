The most striking feature of the elections was the failure of  the candidates to gain the votes needed to prevent the holding  of a second round of voting, which will take place on 4 February  in all the municipalities where candidates were unable to gain  more than 50 percent of the votes cast.    According to the official preliminary results, the  Republican  Democratic and Social Party and the Union of Democratic Forces  [UFD] gained an equal number of votes, especially in the capital  Nouakchott and the financial capital Noudibu.    In Nouakchott, the party of Mauritanian President Maaouiya  Ould Sid Ahmed Taya gained 44.77 percent of the votes cast,  while its rival the UFD, which is the most important opposition  grouping, gained 42 percent of the votes in the capital. The  Union for Democracy and Progress obtained 15 percent of the  votes cast in a total of 208 municipalities in Mauritania.</p>

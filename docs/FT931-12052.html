			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Major urges business to seize export opportunities MR JOHN MAJOR renewed his appeal to British business last night to seize the chance presented by the low levels of UK interest rates and inflation and make the most of export opportunities. The prime minister's call came after he returned to Britain from Saudi Arabia where he had agreed with King Fahd the sale of 48 Tornado aircraft to the Gulf state as part of a defence package estimated to be worth Pounds 4bn-Pounds 5bn to the UK. The 1990s would be the most competitive decade business had ever seen, the prime minister said, and industry would need to invest in technology and training to succeed. After a week in which his success in contributing to export orders for British business in India and the Gulf had been hailed by industry, Mr Major underlined the importance of a range of export markets and the opportunities offered in the European single market. In particular, he highlighted the Far East, and the expanding US market, especially in the light of the UK's current exchange rate. 'We need merchant venturers, not merchants of gloom,' he told a Tory fund-raising dinner in Glasgow. 'It is time to start selling Britain abroad, and stop selling Britain short,' he said. The UK's attractions to foreign investors were manifest, Mr Major said, citing the recent decision by Hoover to relocate from Dijon in France to Cambuslang in Scotland, creating 450 jobs. Mr Major's remarks came against a background chorus of ministerial speeches seeking to reap the benefit of his trade mission, which was slightly overshadowed by his decision to take legal action for libel against two magazines. He promised that government would continue to listen to industry's requests. His speech will have reinforced business hopes that the Budget will contain measures to promote investment and help exporters. In advance of the government's forthcoming policy paper on the relationship of Scotland within the UK, Mr Major admitted that there was a widespread feeling that government was too remote and did not properly recognise Scotland's status. While making it clear that the Union was 'non-negotiable', he emphasised the scope for building on Scotland's existing political institutions.

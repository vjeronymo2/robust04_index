			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / International Company News: Charges push Texaco lower SPECIAL charges resulted in fourth-quarter 1992 net profit at Texaco, the US energy group, declining to Dollars 313m, or Dollars 1.11 a share, from Dollars 324m, or Dollars 1.15, in the corresponding period of 1991. Revenues for the quarter were down marginally at Dollars 9.7bn, against Dollars 9.75bn. For the whole of 1992 Texaco's net profit slumped by 45 per cent to Dollars 712m (Dollars 2.37 per share). This figure, however, included a Dollars 300m charge for changes in accounting principles. Revenues for 1992 were Dollars 37.7bn, down from Dollars 38.3bn in 1991. Mr James Kinnear, outgoing Texaco chief executive, said that beyond special charges, the decline in 1992 profits occurred primarily from soft market conditions for refined products, crude oil market conditions and a generally difficult business environment. But he added that in 1992 Texaco realised cash savings of about Dollars 500m from reductions in operating and overhead expenses. Texaco said its fourth-quarter operating income before taking the charges was Dollars 416m, up from Dollars 295m in the last quarter of 1991. Despite tax benefits of Dollars 40m, the fourth-quarter net profit was depressed by special charges. These included a special write-off of Dollars 34m caused by property damage from a fire at Los Angeles refinery and Hurricane Andrew. In addition, there were Dollars 58m of payments for staff severance payments and Dollars 64m for charges associated with asset-writedowns and reserves for environmental clean-up matters. Operating earnings from US petroleum and natural gas exploration and production in 1992 were Dollars 543m, down from Dollars 605m. Non-US exploration and production operating profits were Dollars 416m in 1992, against Dollars 421m in 1991. Manufacturing and marketing operating income in the US was Dollars 276m in 1992, against Dollars 188m in 1991, and Dollars 300m outside the US, down from Dollars 647m in 1991. Total capital and exploration spending in 1992 was Dollars 3.15bn worldwide, against Dollars 3.57bn in 1991. On Wall Street, Texaco's share price was Dollars  3/8 lower at Dollars 57 3/4 before the close.</p>

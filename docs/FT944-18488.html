			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Turkish privatisation snag A draft law to speed up Turkey's privatisation hit new obstacles after the resignation of a left-wing minister at the weekend, unnerving the stock market and raising fears about the stability of the ruling coalition. The departure on Saturday of state minister Mr Fikri Saglar to prepare his Social Democratic Populist party (SHP), the junior coalition partner, for by-elections in December interrupted the draft's progress toward parliament. Cabinet members had last week announced the bill was ready to go before parliament, giving a lift to the Istanbul stock market. The market index fell back almost 2 per cent to 26,321.62 yesterday amid renewed fears of delays and signs of fragility in the ruling coalition. Also missing is the signature of Mr Mumtaz Soysal, foreign minister, who was attending a United Nations meeting in New York last week, and the former public works minister, Mr Mustafa Yilmaz. Political analysts said the latest blow to privatisation was a result of political haggling after SHP's insistence on simultaneous approval of a democratisation package, scrapping some laws limiting personal freedoms.</p>

			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Adams upbeat at meeting US group Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, yesterday described his meeting in Belfast with an influential Irish-American delegation as 'an important step forward' in the Northern Ireland peace process. He and other Sinn Fein leaders spent three hours with Mr Bruce Morrison, a former US congressman, and five other prominent Irish-Americans, who received a detailed briefing on the peace process from the Irish prime minister and foreign minister on Thursday. Although on a private visit, the US delegation will report back to the White House when it returns to the US next week. After yesterday's meeting Mr Adams said: 'We can look forward to the peace process moving on as a result of these discussions and deliberations.' Sinn Fein believes the Irish-American lobby in the US will have a key role to play in the months ahead, especially in the context of a widely expected imminent IRA ceasefire. The British and Irish governments have emphasised that Sinn Fein will be admitted to round-table political talks only in the event of a permanent end to IRA violence. But politicians on both sides of the border acknowledge that an extended IRA ceasefire will put them under pressure to respond positively, if there is to be any chance of a temporary ceasefire being turned into a permanent one. That is why Sinn Fein sees the powerful Irish-American lobby in the US as having a role in helping to shape US government policy on Ireland, and in turn influencing development of the peace process. Mr Morrison said that he had been 'very encouraged' by yesterday's meeting with the Sinn Fein leadership and that he believed the peace process was moving 'in a very positive direction'. Mr Morrison's delegation is to meet leaders from the Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP) and the Alliance party, but has been snubbed by the two main unionist parties, the UUP and the DUP.</p>

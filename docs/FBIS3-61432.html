Lenin  (Ulyanov); UDC 551.508.551.524]    [Abstract] The suitability of atmospheric refraction  measurements from satellites (ISZ) in order to obtain periodic  data on the weather parameters of the atmosphere and plot their  vertical profiles and the efficiency of remote refractometric  probing as well as the expediency of developing an instrument  for measuring atmospheric refraction prompted the development of  an instrument which combines the functions of gas analyzer and  refractometer whereby refraction is measured on the basis of the  apparent vertical dimension of the sun disc. Block diagrams of  two design versions and the optical train of the refractometer,  a block diagram of the signal processing system, and a video  signal diagram for one line are cited. Both designs are based on  filming the sunset and sunrise from Salyut orbiters through the  earth's atmosphere at a small angle between the direction toward  the sun and the satellite orbit plane whereby the transmitted  ray perigees dissect the atmosphere almost vertically with a  small horizontal displacement on the scale of weather variations  in the weather fields. A vidicon or a dissector can be used as  the photodetector. Figures 3; references 6.</p>

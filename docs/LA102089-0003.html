			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EQUITY  </P> <P> Does your publisher read your editorials? "Edison's Great Leap for Equity"  (Oct. 9) is the one I'm referring to. It contains more of your hypocritical  preaching on equal employment opportunities. As I peruse the masthead  immediately above this editorial, I fail to see a Mary, Jose, Kim, Wong,  Tanaka, Jesse Jackson III, or any other indication of minorities in The Times'  hierarchy. Why don't you practice what you continually preach?  </P> <P> EDWARD DALTON  </P> <P> Westminster  </P></p>

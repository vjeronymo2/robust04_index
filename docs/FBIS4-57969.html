			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 26 May (EFE) -- Paraguayan President  Juan Carlos Wasmosy has said: "I will do my utmost not to  dissolve Congress." A similar statement was once made by  Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori.    Wasmosy made this remark during an exclusive interview with  the Buenos Aires newspaper AMBITO FINANCIERO. Wasmosy said the  Congressional Committee on Illegal Activities "puts its foot in  its mouth so often it has totally lost credibility."    The Paraguayan president noted that Fujimori "strengthened  democracy" in Peru and expressed hopes that "the Paraguayan  people will mature."    Wasmosy said: "Part of the labor movement believes in  violence and makes demands they know cannot be granted."    Wasmosy added that the appearance of a guerrilla movement in  Mexico and the people's rebellions in Paraguay and Argentina  "are part of the same plan."    He said former Uruguayan President Julio Maria Sanguinetti  handled the democratic transition in Uruguay "better" than Raul  Alfonsin did in Argentina.    Juan Carlos Wasmosy said the peasant rebellion is part of an  ultra-leftist campaign and that the Paraguayan military "have  adapted to democracy even though no one wants to admit it."    "We reduced the number of generals from 62 to 38. Congress  stripped them even of their food coupons and reduced everything  they had," Wasmosy said referring to his policy to reorganize  the Armed Forces "without losing the chain of command or  discipline."    The Paraguayan president said labor leaders "know" the  government "cannot give them a 40 percent salary increase  because it would mean 40 percent inflation."    Wasmosy ratified the Paraguayan commitment to the Common  Market of the South (Mercosur) which his country is implementing  with Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay.    "There is no path other than integration, unless someone  shows me something better," the president stressed, adding that  he rejected labor leaders' requests to withdraw from Mercosur.  He added: "This does not mean I will jump into an empty  swimming pool and kill my country with me."    Wasmosy said Paraguay supports the coordination of Mercosur  member countries' economic policies. "We must find a way to  understand the problems facing Brazilians without ruining  Argentine industrialists," Wasmosy added.    The president said that during the Alfonsin administration  (1983-89), "there was a reaction against the Argentine Army"  following the repression of guerrillas which resulted in some  9,000 deaths, according to official figures.    "If the military did not do what they did, Alfonsin could  not  have done what he did, and President (Carlos) Menem could not  have consolidated the Argentine economy," Wasmosy stressed.</p>

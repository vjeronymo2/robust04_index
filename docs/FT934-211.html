			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Chops off the old block lose appeal: Meat producers' efforts to combat vegetarianism Sarah Young, a 17-year old vegetarian at Coombe Girls School in New Malden, Surrey, cooked her own Christmas lunch this year while the rest of her family tucked into roast turkey. 'I used to love eating meat, but the more I found out about the way animals are killed and kept, the more I went off it. Now I can't stand the sight of it,' she says. Ms Young is one of six pupils in a class of 25 at Coombe Girls who have given up eating meat. Most have changed their diets because they disapprove of the killing of animals and of factory farming methods. Surveys suggest the sixth-formers fit the bill for the typical vegetarian - a young, middle-class female living in the south of England. While about 4 per cent of adults are vegetarians - double the figure 10 years ago - the proportion of non-meat eaters among younger age groups is much higher. A report by the Henley Centre for Forecasting, a market research consultancy, for the Asda supermarket group this year found that 11 per cent of girls aged 13 to 15 were vegetarian. Similarly, a Gallup survey for Realeat, a vegetarian food manufacturer, showed that 13 per cent of 16-24-year-old females were vegetarian. Mr Glynne Steele, youth campaigner for the Vegetarian Society, says he receives 50 to 100 letters a day from under-18 year-olds seeking more information about vegetarianism and nutritional advice. The corollary of the drop in meat eating among the young has been a big increase in the market for vegetarian foods. Mintel International, the market research group, says sales of vegetarian foods, including fruit and vegetables as well as specialist items, exceeded Pounds 11bn in 1992, compared with Pounds 8.8bn in 1988. Sales of 'meat alternatives' - for instance soya products and Quorn, made from a mushroom-like substance - reached Pounds 25.5m last year from Pounds 6.6m in 1988. In spite of the growing popularity of vegetarianism, the Meat and Livestock Commission, responsible for promoting Britain's meat, takes a surprisingly relaxed view. It is dismissive of the number of teenage girls giving up meat, saying they are doing so as a 'protest'. The commission's statistics show total meat consumption has remained steady, or even risen slightly: 65.4kg per person per year in 1990 against 64.2kg in 1970. 'I bet a lot of retailers would be delighted to have a product that penetrates into 97 per cent of households,' said Mr Ambrose Landon, commission press and industry relations manager. But the overall figures for meat consumption disguise a shift away from red meat towards poultry, and a move by consumers towards eating meat as a treat in restaurants rather than as a mainstay at home. Both trends threaten the traditional markets of many meat producers. At the same time, Mr Landon accepts meat producers are having to adapt to a changing market place, where convenience is the priority. Government food surveys highlight the growing popularity of meat products such as sausages and minced meat over traditional cuts. Consumption of carcass meat - roasting joints, chops and other cuts close to the bone - has declined in recent years, from 11oz per person each week in 1991 to about 10oz last year. But consumption of other meat and meat products rose to 23.5oz from 22.7oz. 'When people say they are cutting down on meat, they probably mean joints and traditional cuts of meat. Many do not class their sausages or spaghetti Bolognese as meat,' says Mr Landon. The Vegetarian Society addresses the commission's arguments by saying many people are rejecting factory farming methods and turning to free-range and organically-raised meat. Consumption of the latter increased from Pounds 1m to Pounds 9m between 1988 and 1992, according to Mintel. 'These are at least steps in the right direction,' says Mr Steele. He believes the spread of information about how farm animals are reared and slaughtered is turning more people vegetarian: 'A hundred animals are killed every second of the working day in this country. Most are being kept in abhorrent conditions and being killed in a terrible way.' Attitudes are formed early. Adam McNamara, aged 10, gave up eating meat a year ago after seeing a news report about conditions in slaughterhouses. 'If a few more people became vegetarians, perhaps farmers would start being a bit kinder to animals,' he says. At Coombe Girls, sixth-former Clare Langen says she gave up eating meat after she saw her uncle, a farmer, kill a chicken. 'I saw him wring its neck and I can't look at meat without thinking about it.' The play on emotions by vegetarian campaigners angers meat producers, who believe the standard of animal welfare in the UK is second to none. 'Many farmers would like to see all vegetarians hung, drawn and quartered,' says a National Farmers' Union official wryly. So far, however, the counter-offensive by meat producers against the vegetarian lobby has focused on trying to win the debate over the health aspects of eating red meat. A Gallup poll this year found that 6.5 per cent of adults avoid red meat, against 1.9 per cent a decade ago, while 40 per cent say they are eating less meat. 'You've got to separate the myth from the facts of vegetarianism. These young people have got to be told the facts about meat, its nutritional value and how good it is for you,' says Mr Martin Burtt, a Yorkshire beef farmer. There is a sense of defensiveness: 'To tell you the truth, the few vegetarians I've seen are not exactly healthy-looking specimens,' he says. Dr Michael Nelson, lecturer in nutrition at King's College, London, a vegetarian, agrees there are some health benefits to eating meat - but not many. 'There are probably some advantages in terms of iron intake and vitamin B12, but I wouldn't recommend eating it every day.' He says there can be as much as seven times the amount of saturated fat  - which can increase the risk of heart disease - as polyunsaturated fat in some meat, whereas vegetable oils contain up to twice as much polyunsaturated as saturated fat. In an attempt to prevent the debate tilting further in favour of vegetarians, the Meat and Livestock commission launched its Pounds 1.5m 'Meat to Live' advertising campaign two years ago. This was targeted at young women in the 20 to 35 age group who were considering reducing their meat intake or that of their partners. The glossy adverts featured fit, good-looking men, frolicking in the surf or playing sports, and stressed the health benefits of eating meat. The Vegetarian Society labelled the adverts typical of the 'sexist' approach of the commission. 'It's saying: Well, women. If you want men to look like that, you've got to feed them meat,' said Mr Steele. The commission, however, claimed the campaign was a success, at least in beginning to arrest the numbers of young women cutting down on meat eating. After a year, the commission surveyed women in the target age range and found that the number who said they were eating less meat had fallen from 15 to 14 per cent. The number of women who planned to cut meat consumption in future had dropped from 7 to 5 per cent. The commission plans a television, magazine and poster campaign in spring, costing more than Pounds 7m, to persuade meat eaters to keep up the habit. 'Its objective will be to show that meat is a modern, versatile food,' says Mr David Lewis, the commission's communications manager. Stopping the growth of vegetarianism among young people - and countering fears about animal welfare - will be a much harder task. Most pupils at Coombe Girls, even the meat eaters, felt they could not pass a butcher's shop without averting their eyes.</p>

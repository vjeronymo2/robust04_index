			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] There has been a substantial improvement in  Australia's trade position with figures for January showing a  welcome fall in imports and rise in exports.    Seasonally adjusted trade deficit for the month was $1.26  billion [Australian dollars]. That is in line with market  expections and well down on the revised December result which  blew out to $1.6 billion.    Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics show the  balance of merchandise trade turned around from a deficit in  December to a surplus in January. There was a seasonally  adjusted 4 percent rise in exports during the month while  imports fell 5 percent, helping to quell market fears that the  economic recovery was running too fast.    The fall in import was despite the purchase by Qantas of a  new aircraft -- the first civil aircraft imported since October  of last year.</p>

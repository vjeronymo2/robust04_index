			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Money Markets: Rate cut hopes soar THE surprise decision by the German central bank to cut key interest rates by  1/2 percentage point gave a fillip to European interest rate contracts yesterday, writes Peter John. The main beneficiary of the Bundesbank announcement was the French three-month lending contract which, at one stage, jumped almost a third of a point from its previous close. France desperately needs lower interest rates to regenerate its economy and the market was convinced yesterday that a reduction in the French intervention rate, which sets the floor for French lending, would come very shortly. The futures contract for December finished 30 basis points higher on the day at 93.76. Belgium would also benefit greatly from lower rates and the Belgian December futures contract rose 23 basis points to 92.30. Meanwhile, the German December contract gained 12 basis points at 93.86. The short sterling contract for December closed at its high of the day, 11 basis points stronger at 94.73. One dealer said: 'The Bundesbank reduction makes a half-point cut in the UK as near certain as you can get in market terms. It also increases the possibility of a cut before the Budget. Finally, it increases the flexibility of Mr Clarke to make a full one-point cut.' Money market operations in the UK were tight yesterday, with the Bank of England unable to attract any takers for the early round of assistance after forecasting a liquidity shortage of around Pounds 1bn, later revised to Pounds 1.05bn. Among the main factors affecting the shortage were the take-up of Treasury Bills and paper maturing in official hands which drained Pounds 473m from the system. Exchequer transactions removed Pounds 380m, and a rise in note circulation withdrew Pounds 135m. The Bank only provided Pounds 14m of morning assistance, via band one bank bills at the established rate of 5 7/8 per cent. It was not until the afternoon that those with collateral were prepared to sell bills and the Bank could buy Pounds 723m of band one bank bills at 5 7/8 per cent. This still left a shortfall which was taken up with late assistance of Pounds 225m at the unspecified rate. The Bank of England announced that Banco Central Hispanoamericano had been added to the list of eligible institutions.</p>

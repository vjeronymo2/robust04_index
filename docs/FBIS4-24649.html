			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 27 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--This year,  the Beijing authorities have adopted a series of macroeconomic  regulation and control measures to inhibit inflation, and  initial results have been scored as prices of all categories of  capital goods have dropped across the board in the first quarter.    Information released by mainland China's Ministry of  Internal  Trade and Material Supply Information Center shows that the  aggregate average price increase of all categories of capital  goods in the first quarter of this year was 8.2 percent, a  decrease of 30 percentage points in the rate of inflation  compared with the 38.2 percent recorded in the same period last  year. Prices continued to drop in April, and the inflation rate  has decreased from 15.8 percent in January this year to 0.4  percent now.    In January, prices of steel products used as building  materials soared by a wide margin, since all sectors of the  community were optimistic about the economic development trend,  and the state on its part moderately increased the money supply  and implemented some reformatory measures. Price hikes were  later stopped and are tending toward stability, showing a slight  drop as a result of the policy of macroeconomic regulation and  control practiced by the state. From information released by  the Material Supply Information Center, the average price of  steel products stood at 3,580 yuan per metric ton across the  country in March, a further decrease of 0.6 percent in addition  to the 0.5 percent decrease recorded in February. As compared  with the price level in the same period last year, the general  price level of steel products decreased by 4.5 percent, with  small section steel prices decreasing, in particular, by as much  as 11.8 percent. The average price for a car is 173,000 yuan, a  decrease of nearly 10,000 yuan compared with the highest price  recorded earlier this year. Meanwhile, building materials  prices keep decreasing, with the nationwide average price for  cement standing at 369 yuan per metric ton in March, a decrease  of 5.4 percent compared with the price earlier this year. The  price of coal remains relative stable.    Experts predict that since the general price level of major  capital goods, such as steel products, timber, and cement,  remains basically stable, prices of all categories of capital  goods will remain stable as well, probably showing a slight drop  in the second quarter.</p>

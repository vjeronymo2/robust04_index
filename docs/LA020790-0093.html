			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIETNAM MEMORIAL DEVELOPS THIN CRACKS;  </P> <P> VETERANS: THE PROJECT'S MAIN FUND-RAISER STARTS A $1-MILLION CAMPAIGN TO PAY  FOR UNANTICIPATED REPAIRS. WHO IS AT FAULT HAS YET TO BE DETERMINED.  </P> <P> The Vietnam Veterans Memorial, a pair of polished granite walls that has become  the capital's most visited monument, has developed hairline cracks and will  require extensive future repairs, the project's principal fund-raiser said  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Jan C. Scruggs, president of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund, said the  organization has launched a direct-mail drive to raise about $1 million to  finance the unanticipated repairs and other long-term maintenance needs.  </P> <P> Scruggs said that some of the cracks in the 8-year-old granite walls, which  bear the names of 58,258 fatalities in the Southeast Asian conflict, could be  the result of faulty construction or flawed materials.  </P> <P> He said the memorial fund is entering into legal arbitration proceedings to  determine whether financial responsibility for the repairs should fall on the  builder, the suppliers or the monument's sponsors.  </P> <P> The Gilbane Building Co., a Rhode Island firm with offices in Washington, was  the principal contractor on the memorial. A spokesman for the company could not  be reached Tuesday for comment.  </P> <P> Scruggs, who served as a combat infantryman in Vietnam, led the fund-raising  effort that raised $9 million to build the memorial on a two-acre site allotted  by Congress near the Lincoln and Washington monuments. The memorial fund agreed  to maintain it in perpetuity.  </P> <P> Until now, surplus money from the original drive had been sufficient to finance  maintenance. But the discovery of the hairline cracks and other anticipated  expenses made a bigger budget appear necessary, Scruggs said.  </P> <P> "We just decided a few months ago that looking at the long-term needs, we  should have an endowment of about $1 million to provide enough income," Scruggs  said. "We have already started a direct-mail appeal, and money is coming in."  </P> <P> The fund recently bought a supply of Bangalore granite from India to ensure  that replacement panels match the original wall, he said. The replacement  granite has been polished and placed in storage at Quantico Marine Base near  Washington.  </P> <P> Gray in its natural state, the stone turns almost black when polished, making  the gold-etched lettering appear to float on the surface of the wall.  </P> <P> Since the monument's 1982 dedication, 262 names have been added and many more  corrected as new information about Vietnam casualties has emerged. Last year,  the addition of 60 names to the walls cost $90,000, Scruggs said.  </P> <P> The memorial's designer, Maya Lin, said in an interview that she does not  believe the flaws are serious. "I was only the designer," she said, "but I am  certain the technical people who built it did their absolute best."  </P> <P> Now a practicing architect in New York, Lin was a 21-year-old architecture  student at Yale University when she won the $20,000 first prize for her  controversial design.  </P> <P> The starkly simple memorial is a wide, V-shaped excavation walled in granite.  Visitors descend from the surface along sloping paths to the vertex, where the  walls are 10 feet high and the names of the first and last fatalities of the  war are engraved.  </P> <P> The memorial is situated atop filled land on what was once wetlands bordering  the Potomac River. The adjacent Lincoln Memorial, completed in 1922, has  suffered from settling problems, and a planned ground-floor museum there has  never been opened because of dampness.  </P> <P> Besides the cracking, Scruggs said the Vietnam memorial also has experienced  vandalism.  </P> <P> "I was down there today," he said, "and I actually did find a new scratch on  panel 59 E (the 59th panel on the east wall) and what looked as if somebody had  thrown some kind of liquid on Panel 25 E."  </P></p>

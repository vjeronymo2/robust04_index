			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: SOUTH GATE;  </P> <P> ANIMAL SHELTER TO BE CLOSED JULY 1  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has announced  it will close its South Gate animal shelter July 1.  </P> <P> The shelter, which has been in the same location for 39 years, is too old and  too small, said Edward C. Cubrda, executive director of the Los Angeles SPCA.  The nonprofit organization, which contracts with six Southeast cities including  South Gate, has leased the building from the city of South Gate. The current  three-year lease expires July 1.  </P> <P> The society, whose services include animal control and animal abuse  investigations, has wanted to purchase the land but the city was not willing to  sell. The site is in a redevelopment project area, Cubrda said.  </P> <P> Animals in the South Gate shelter will be transferred to other animal control  agencies in the area or to the SPCA's main shelter in Los Angeles or its  Hawthorne shelter, Cubrda said.  </P> <P> A meeting is scheduled at 10 a.m. Feb. 10 at South Gate City Hall to discuss  what the six contract cities will do to continue providing animal services.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ottawa, 1 Jun (XINHUA) -- Canadian Governor General  Ramon John Hnatyshyn met Wu Bangguo, head of a Shanghai  Municipality delegation, at the Governor's Mansion on 1 June.    Hnatyshyn told Wu Bangguo: Now is the opportune time to  develop Canadian-Chinese relations. China's economy has  developed rapidly. Canada can become China's economic  cooperation partner.    Hnatyshyn welcomed the exhibition of Shanghai commodities in  Toronto. He said: The Shanghai commodities exhibition benefits  both sides.    Hnatyshyn had toured Shanghai during his April visit to  China. He said: Although Canada is only in the initial stages  of setting up joint ventures in Shanghai, the number of such  ventures has increased 400 percent over the past two years,  presenting vast potential in this respect.    Wu Bangguo told Hnatyshyn that the purpose of his visit was  to increase bilateral economic cooperation, and that he had  brought along proposals for some projects that can be launched  in conjunction with Canada. He said: The Shanghai commodities  exhibition, which opened on 30 May, has progressed smoothly,  recording $12 million in transactions on the first day.    On the same day, Canadian Industry Minister John Manley also  met with Wu Bangguo. The two sides held talks on issues of  common interest.</p>

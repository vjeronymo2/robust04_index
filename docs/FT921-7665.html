			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Lessons of Potchefstroom South Africa's president, Mr F W de Klerk, is fighting for his political life. He is doing so with characteristic courage. He has responded to the challenge of a serious by-election defeat with a challenge of his own. The consequence is that white South Africans will now be faced with a fateful choice - whether to press ahead with the reform process initiated by Mr de Klerk, or whether to make what would be a disastrous attempt to stop the clock. Mr de Klerk's decision was announced yesterday, following the victory of the pro-apartheid Conservative Party in Potchefstroom on Wednesday. This western Transvaal constituency was formerly a safe seat for the governing National Party, but the CP won it with a commanding majority. The outcome of one by-election can often be brushed aside as the consequence of a protest vote. Potchefstroom could be different. It may have signalled the draining-away of white support for the reform process. The answer will be established by means of an early referendum of white voters. Its purpose will be to settle which party the white electorate wishes to represent it in negotiations with the African National Congress and other representatives of the black majority. A great deal of care will have to be taken with the question, which could determine the outcome. If he loses the referendum, the president said in the white parliament yesterday, he would resign and call a general election. Thus has the man many South Africans have compared to Mikhail Gorbachev put at risk his own fate and that of his country in one dramatic announcement. False promise The choices before all South Africans could not be more stark. The Conservative Party holds out the false promise of a white or white-ruled Afrikaner republic whose land area contains the richest and most developed mining and agricultural part of the countrywithout ceding, yet, any of the rest of South Africa as currently constituted. It would be apartheid with no real change except the possibility that the maps might be amended. Piling up enough urban votes to win a referendum would be a triumph for the CP, since it is strongest in the rural constituencies. If it won, it would be set for a landslide victory in the subsequent election. It is probable that the military would be able to contain the black uprising that would be a consequence of such a retrogression, but the process would be bloody. The revolt, and the cost of containing it, would be many times greater than in the early 1980s. South Africa would be more isolated by the world community than it was before President de Klerk released Mr Nelson Mandela and began the process of seeking a peaceful settlement. Powerful mandate If Mr De Klerk wins, however, he will have a powerful mandate upon which to base further negotiations, leading to an early interim government representative of all parties. His difficulty is that, as a negotiator, he cannot lay all his cards on the table. White South Africans are uncertain about which compromises he is willing to make over power-sharing and safeguards for minorities. They will be asked to put their trust in the president. In a country riddled with fear this is asking a lot. Yet Mr de Klerk's record suggests that there is no other white South African in whom it would be better to place such faith. Black South Africans meanwhile face a test of their patience. The way in which the ANC and the other non-white or non-racial parties behave between now and the referendum could affect its outcome. The option of sitting this one out while the whites make up their minds will not be appealing to leaders of what is still a quasi-revolutionary movement impatient to take a share of government power. Yet the president of the ANC, Mr Nelson Mandela, needs the support of Mr de Klerk just as much as the latter needs him. Mr Mandela will have to draw on all the powers of vision and statesmanship expected of him when he was released just two years ago if he is to steer his own people to a successful negotiation with the only party willing and able to agree power-sharing in South Africa.</p>

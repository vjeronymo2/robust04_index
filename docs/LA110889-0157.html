			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> 'L.A. LAW' ROLE BECOMES WINNER  </P> <P> Actress Michelle Greene said she was able to get producer Steven Bochco to make  her "L.A. Law" character independent and more attractive because Bochco is a  "feminist at heart."  </P> <P> Greene plays lawyer Abby Perkins in the NBC series.  </P> <P> The actress, in an interview for the Nov. 11 issue of TV Guide magazine, said  she decided to talk to the show's producers about her character after the first  season.  </P> <P> Abby was "never seen doing anything involving the law," Greene said. "She was  this mousy creature to whom all kinds of dreadful things kept happening. She  had an alcoholic husband, she got beaten up, her child was kidnaped, she had a  messy divorce."  </P> <P> Greene said she confronted the producers, saying, "I guess every show has to  have the obligatory female victim in it, but I don't want to play the victim  any more. I don't want to spend all my time crying on camera."  </P></p>

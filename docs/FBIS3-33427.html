			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gonzalo Marroquin] </F>   [Text] Guatemala City, 19 Feb (AFP) -- The unexpected  reorganization of the military leadership in Guatemala might  have been prompted by President Ramiro de Leon Carpio's and an  Army group's wish to facilitate peace negotiations with the  guerrilla groups, it was stated today by the media and military  sources.    President de Leon announced on Friday the dismissal of  National Defense Chief of Staff Jose Luis Quilo and the  appointment of General Marco Antonio Gonzalez as his  replacement, in an unexpected action that provoked numerous  rumors in the Guatemalan capital. De Leon appointed Gen. Carlos  Enrique Pineda to the post of assistant chief of staff.  Gonzalez is considered the president's "trusted man" while  Pineda is a commander with a well-known background as fighter in  the low-intensity war that has prevailed in the country for 33  years. Given his post, Pineda must join the government peace  commission that will resume negotiations with Guatemalan  National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) guerrilla commanders in  March.    The government meeting with the URNG, to be held in Mexico  City, was initially scheduled for the second half of February.  However, it was postponed until the UN Human Rights Commission,  currently gathered in Geneva, issues a resolution on Guatemala.    The morning newspaper PRENSA LIBRE today reviewed the  changes  that occurred in the military leadership, terming them  "encouraging signs" of the government's "positive" attitude. LA  REPUBLICA said the removals represent a "rearrangement" of  currents within the Army and they are linked with the peace  negotiations. According to analysts, the less "harder" line  within the Armed Forces has been strengthened by the movements,  but those analysts do not dare speculate if the initiative came  from the presidential office or the military barracks.    Military commanders have officially termed these movements  as  "routine" although a military source consulted by AFP admitted  there are "divisions" within the corps on the position that  should be assumed in the negotiations with the URNG rebels. A  controversy recently arose regarding the guerrilla demand to  create a Truth Commission, similar to the one which last year  investigated war crimes in El Salvador and provoked the fall of  the country's highest ranking military leaders, who were charged  with numerous human rights violations.    Guatemalan Defense Minister Gen. Mario Enriquez said "the  Army's activities can be verified at any moment;" adding the  commission was not necessary. He said such an investigation  would be used to discredit the military corps and it would  increase divisions among the Guatemalan people. Enriquez said  the guerrilla group will also have to answer for its crimes,  including the deaths of U.S. Ambassador John Gordon Mein and  German Ambassador Karl von Spreti in the 1960's, and journalist  Isidoro Zarco, owner of the morning newspaper PRENSA LIBRE, in  the 1970's.</p>

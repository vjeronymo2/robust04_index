			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Yeltsin greets PM with warning against air strikes in Bosnia Russian president Boris Yeltsin meets UK prime minister John Major in the Kremlin yesterday. During their discussions Mr Yeltsin raised strong objections to the threat of air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs, warning that Nato would not succeed in ending the conflict without Russian agreement. The meeting, which was Mr Yeltsin's first public appearance for two weeks, came as the president's health and ability to govern emerged again as an issue of serious concern in Moscow after he postponed a 'state of the nation' address due on Friday. Officials blamed a continuing 'bad cold'. Yeltsin balks over Nato's threat to Serbs, Page 2; Worries over Yeltsin's health as keynote speech is postponed, Page 24</p>

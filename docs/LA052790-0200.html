			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BAYLOR COMES HOME AGAIN;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: MILWAUKEE BREWERS' HITTING COACH BECOMES THIRD MEMBER OF ANGELS' HALL  OF FAME.  </P> <P> Don Baylor stood behind home plate at Anaheim Stadium Saturday and said it was  still home, so many uniforms later.  </P> <P> "I can't believe it's happening and I'm in another uniform," he said in the  hours before the Angels made him the third member of their Hall of Fame. "I  always thought I'd be like Brian Downing or Bobby (Grich). We came here  together in 1977."  </P> <P> Grich, who became the first member of the Angels' Hall of Fame in 1988, was on  the field to honor Baylor. Downing, nearing the end of his career, is still in  an Angel uniform.  </P> <P> Baylor wore a suit, but after handshakes and hugs and an honorary first pitch  -- a lob in the dirt to former teammate Downing -- Baylor put on No. 25 for the  Milwaukee Brewers and spent the evening in the visitors' dugout, a hitting  coach at 40.  </P> <P> The home plate where Baylor had stood was his own plot of dirt in 1979, the  year the Angels won their first division championship. It was also the year  Baylor became the only Angel to be named MVP of the American League, the year  he hit .296 with 36 homers and 139 runs batted in.  </P> <P> It was home in 1982, when the Angels won the AL West again, only to blow a 2-0  lead to the Milwaukee Brewers in the playoffs.  </P> <P> In 1986, it was at home plate in Anaheim Stadium that Baylor, then a member of  the Boston Red Sox, hit a two-run homer off Mike Witt in the ninth inning of  Game 5 of the League Championship Series. It became the prelude to the Angels'  most wrenching failure to reach the World Series, after Dave Henderson's home  run off Donnie Moore sent the game into extra innings and an eventual Boston  victory.  </P> <P> "Those guys had a chance to go to the World Series, up three games to one,"  Baylor said. "I wanted to go to one, too."  </P> <P> Some people thought Baylor's part in that game was a measure of revenge against  Buzzie Bavasi, the former Angel general manager who had publicly criticized  him, and who was content to let Baylor leave for the New York Yankees after the  1982 season, failing to re-sign him.  </P> <P> "I wanted to stay here," he said. "It was bitter. . . .  </P> <P> "Not bitter," he said, looking for another word, but not finding one. "I had  ties here. I felt I was part of the community. I felt I was part of the  building process with the Angels. It was very, very difficult for me to leave  and go to New York."  </P> <P> In the years since, he has gotten revenge in triplicate, going to the World  Series in the final three years of his playing career with the Boston Red Sox,  the Minnesota Twins and the Oakland Athletics.  </P> <P> Baylor said he has not spoken to Bavasi since 1982, expressing whatever  feelings he has by his very restraint.  </P> <P> While going through some personal belongings this winter, he found a letter  Bavasi had written to him in 1982.  </P> <P> "It's still sealed," Baylor said.  </P> <P> It could be an apology, but Baylor said he does not wonder.  </P> <P> "It could be a check for $2 million," he said, laughing. "I doubt it. . . .  Maybe someone will open it in a hundred years."  </P> <P> The mood Saturday was a sentimental, as Baylor joined Grich and Jim Fregosi in  the Angels' Hall of Fame.  </P> <P> Gene Autry, the man Baylor called "the best owner in baseball" was there to  call him a friend. Dave Winfield, his Yankee teammate and now the player meant  to become the kind of clubhouse leader Baylor had been, was there to do the  same, as was Grich.  </P> <P> "When I come into this ballpark," Baylor said. "I still call this home."  </P></p>

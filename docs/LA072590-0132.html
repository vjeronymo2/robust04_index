			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENERGY COMPANIES POST MIXED RESULTS  </P> <P> Several companies joined a growing list of oil firms that have reported strong  profits despite low crude prices in the spring, although the low crude prices  worked to depress earnings at others.  </P> <P> * Chevron Corp. reported that second-quarter earnings jumped 60% to $648  million, compared to $404 million in last year's second quarter. Revenue rose  to $8.9 billion from $8.2 billion.  </P> <P> Refining and marketing, known in the industry as "downstream" operations, were  the source of the San Francisco company's biggest gain. U.S. downstream  operations reported record earnings of $370 million in the quarter, compared to  $103 million in the year-ago period.  </P> <P> "We are particularly pleased with the strong operating performance of our U.S.  downstream business during the second quarter," said Chairman and Chief  Executive Ken Derr. "As the nation's largest refiner and marketer, we benefited  significantly from strong product sales margins, which in part reflect progress  in our programs to upgrade our refinery and service station network."  </P> <P> For the first half, Chevron earnings rose to $1.12 billion from $717 million in  last year's first half. Revenue rose to $18.3 billion from $15.9 billion.  </P> <P> * Mobil posted a 24.2% increase in earnings to $498 million, compared to $401  million in the year-ago quarter. Revenue fell to $13.82 billion from $14.03  billion.  </P> <P> The 1990 quarter included a net gain of $182 million from the sale of two major  assets, while the company posted a $140-million loss on the sale of southern  Africa operations in last year's second quarter.  </P> <P> For the first half, Mobil had earnings of $898 million, compared to $830  million in the like period last year. Revenue rose slightly to $28.85 billion  from $28.05 billion.  </P> <P> * Texaco, the nation's third-largest oil company, said net income during the  quarter totaled $353 million, down from $366 million a year ago.  </P> <P> Revenue rose 3% to $8.72 billion from $8.45 billion a year ago, largely because  of higher crude and oil product sales volumes.  </P> <P> In addition to lower crude prices during the second quarter, natural gas prices  also fell and petrochemical results were "significantly lower . . . because of  oversupply and reduced demand," Texaco President and Chief Executive James W.  Kinnear said in a statement from the company's White Plains, N.Y.,  headquarters.  </P> <P> For the year's first half, Texaco reported net income of $681 million down 63%  from $1.82 billion in the year-ago period, which included a $1.19-billion gain  from the sale of Texaco Canada Inc. Without the gain, this year's net income  was up 8%, the company said.  </P> <P> First-half revenue was off 1% at $17.88 billion from $18.06 billion.  </P> <P> * Phillips, of Bartlesville, Okla., reported second-quarter net income of $105  million, down from $197 million a year ago.  </P> <P> The recent quarter included $58 million in insurance reimbursement that  compensated for lost earnings at Phillips' Houston chemical complex, which was  shut down after an accident in October, 1989 and remains closed.  </P> <P> Revenue declined 9% to $2.98 billion from $3.3 billion a year ago.  </P></p>

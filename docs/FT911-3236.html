			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Anger over government challenge - How unions view their Civil Service pay offer THIS year the government's side in pay talks with the two largest groups of civil servants was led by two people new to salary negotiations. If the unions hoped for an easy time through their opponents' inexperience, however, they have been disappointed. Ms Gillian Shephard, minister of state at the Treasury, and Ms Anthea Case, senior civil servant, pitched an offer low enough to provoke the first significant challenge to long-term pay agreements since they were introduced into the Civil Service four years ago. The challenge arose from union perceptions that the 8 per cent pay offer breaks the spirit of the long-term agreements. It was probably not unwelcome to a government keen to show the private sector how to conclude low pay deals but severely constrained in its ability to do so this year because of clauses in the deals. The problem for the leaderships of the CPSA and NUCPS unions is that the offer does not break the letter of the long-term agreements. They were therefore faced with recommending acceptance of the 8 per cent offer, or moving towards industrial action which they knew their members were reluctant to take. The CPSA executive this week decided on acceptance; the NUCPS recommended rejection, with the possibility of a ballot on industrial action. Whatever the result of that ballot, the unions' hostile response has deflected attention from the potentially embarrassing fact that the 8 per cent offer could be interpreted as inflationary. The retail prices index is expected to fall to below 7 per cent this month; the offer is due for implementation from April 1. An inflation-plus deal does not look good for a government that is constantly preaching that employers should make 'affordable' pay rises, interpreted by most as meaning below inflation. The government has not escaped without criticism. Shortly after the offer was announced, Mr John Banham, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, observed that public pay was rising too fast, threatening 'further essential cuts in interest rates'. But the criticisms would have been worse without the public controversy over the offers. In the Civil Service negotiations, the government's hand was forced by the long-term pay agreements through which rises are linked to increases in the private sector. The Civil Service rises must fall in the middle 50 per cent of the private sector increases during the previous year. Rising inflation works to the government's benefit because private sector earnings tend to track the retail prices index. As inflation falls, as now, the opposite occurs and the Treasury's comparability concessions cause difficulties. The advantage for the government of the long-term deal is that the unions have allowed the Treasury more flexibility in where to target money. In the first years of the deals, high performing civil servants in London - where recruitment and retention were most difficult - were awarded higher rises than others. This year the high rises have been targeted at the low-paid who have won up to 11 per cent. Most of the more than 300,000 civil servants covered by the offers will receive between 7.6 per cent and 7.8 per cent. That is what has angered the unions who say the long-term agreements would only be honoured in spirit if all members were offered at least 8 per cent, the lowest point of the middle 50 per cent in the private sector. In spite of their annoyance, there is little support among the two unions' leaderships for pulling out of the agreements. Mr John Ellis, CPSA general secretary, said yesterday that the agreements have stabilised industrial relations in the Civil Service, making strikes such as those staged in 1981 and 1987 less likely. Until this year they have also provided fair increases, he says. He estimates that without the long-term agreements, this year's offer would only have been about 6 per cent. His union will push for changes to the agreements, for example to make more use of arbitration. The NUCPS, the most reluctant of the Civil Service unions to join the long-term agreements, is less positive about them. It is not hostile, however, and its leadership will argue against withdrawal at this year's annual conference. Significantly, the union's executive did not this week order an immediate ballot on industrial action. That would only come if members supported the rejection recommendation and the government continued to reject arbitration. That means industrial action can be virtually ruled out. A ballot may eventually be held on industrial action, but it will come at a time when the inflation rate is considerably less than the value of the offer. In a recession, when hundreds of thousands of workers are being made redundant, few workers would strike for an improvement to an inflation-plus offer.</p>

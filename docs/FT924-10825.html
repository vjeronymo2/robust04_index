			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: French insurers The 59 per cent fall in UAP's first half profits looks a dreadful performance even by the dismal standards of its peers. But the real lesson of yesterday's figures - and those from GAN and AGF earlier in the month - is that the company's previous results were flattered by unsustainably high asset values. UAP is now showing some signs of getting to grips with pricing and concentrating its attention on profits rather than market share. Premium increases, though, have not gone nearly far enough. The whole sector is vulnerable to recession-related claims of the kind which have plagued the UK domestic market if the French economy takes another downward twist next year. The real problem, though, is unlocking some of the unrealised capital gains which give UAP its apparent financial strength and which have underpinned profits in the past. Two thirds of the total is tied up in land and buildings.</p>

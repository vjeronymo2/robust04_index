The document allegedly  proves that on the second Sunday of January 1989, Agusta  Chairman Otetti met with Claes, economic affairs minister at the  time, to discuss the helicopter compensations.    The remarkable thing is that Otetti had already been fired  as  chairman of the Board of Directors by Agusta that day. At  present, he is on the run somewhere in South America, probably  in Brazil. It is only the next day that d'Allessandro was  appointed as Agusta's new chairman.    The document in which this meeting between Claes and Otetti  was mentioned for the first time, is a statement by Agusta  manager Baldini, heard by Ancia early last year in the Italian  city of Firenze. So far, the document has not been transmitted  to the Chamber and Senate committees which had to decide on the  lifting of the parliamentary immunity of Come, Spitaels, and  Mathot. However, the Public Prosecutor's Office in Liege did  transmit the document to Guy Mathot's lawyers. The latter used  the document for the first time last Tuesday [18 January],  during a hearing of the committee in the Walloon Regional  Council. [passage omitted]</p>

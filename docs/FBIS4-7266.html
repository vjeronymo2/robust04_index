			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Dear friends: The 919th Flight Group of  Vietnam's National Civil Aviation Sector will turn 35 years old  on 1 May this year. Beginning as an air squadron with 15  pilots, 13 mechanics, and 14 navigators, the 919th Flight Group  has grown and made substantial contributions to the cause of  national defense and construction. You, friends, are invited to  listen to the following essay by Minh Duc, a correspondent of  Radio Voice of Vietnam, entitled: 35 Years of Operations and  Growth of the 919th Air Group:    On 15 February 1965, the 919th Air Force Regiment shot down  a  U.S.-owned C-123 aircraft in Yen Bai airspace, annihilating an  enemy commando team aboard the aircraft. This was its first  aerial victory over the enemy that opened up the air-to-air  battlefront for the Vietnamese People's Army.    On the night of 8 March 1966, an AN2 plane from the regiment  sank a boat carrying U.S. and Puppet commandos in the sea of  Thanh Hoa, thus starting an air-to-sea battlefront for the  Vietnamese People's Air Force.    We had the opportunity to meet the old pilots of the former  919th Air Force Regiment now known as the 919th Flight Group.  All of them, whether they had already retired or continue to  serve as pilots, share the same military habit, that is,  speaking less and working hard. Mr. Nguyen Ai Dong, one of the  first team leaders of the 919th regiment is a man of such  qualities. He was very excited when recounting his memories of  how he flew Uncle Ho to go on TDY.

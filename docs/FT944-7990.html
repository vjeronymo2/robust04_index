			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Observer: Deuce Two years ago, SAS International Hotels came up with an acceptably ageist wheeze. Provided there were vacancies, guests over 65 could get a discount equivalent to their ages. So 70-year-olds had 70 per cent knocked off their bill; anyone arriving in their hundredth year would get the room free. Kurt Ritter, chief executive of Radisson-SAS, as the company is now called, says all went well until a Swedish guest turned up recently at one of the company's hostelries in Vienna and announced that he was 102. He demanded to be paid 2 per cent of the room rate to stay the night. The hotel agreed. The sprightly guest then demanded a game of tennis with the general manager - and got that, too. It is not known whether he took the GM to five sets.</p>

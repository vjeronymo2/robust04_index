			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> EXPERT SAYS PLATYPUS FACES EXTINCTION  </P> <P> Fossils found at one of the world's richest archeological sites have led  scientists to fear for the survival of the platypus, a furry mammal with webbed  feet, a beaver-like tail and a ducklike bill.  </P> <P> Michael Archer, one of the scientists who discovered the fossil site in  northwestern Queensland, believes the platypus may be on the same evolutionary  path as the extinct Tasmanian tiger.  </P> <P> "I would be delighted if it survives 1,000 years, but I would be surprised if  it lasts 100," said Archer, professor of zoology at the University of New South  Wales.  </P> <P> Archer bases his theory on information gleaned from 25-million-year-old fossils  of the platypus's ancestor, the obdurodon, which were found at Riversleigh, a  huge cattle station in the parched savannah below the Gulf of Carpentaria.  </P> <P> "It was a very important find because it was instrumental in telling us that  the platypus is in evolutionary trouble," Archer said.  </P> <P> He explained that the platypus that inhabited the lush tropical forests of  Australia millions of years ago had many advantages over its modern descendant.  Over time, the platypus has become smaller, less versatile and less able to  ward off predators, he said.  </P> <P> "It used to have a huge set of teeth, it was much bigger and inhabited about  half the continent," Archer said.  </P> <P> The numbers that remain are impossible to determine, but the platypus has  disappeared from South Australia, where it was common 100 years ago, said  Dominic Fanning, a research fellow at Taronga Zoo in Sydney.  </P> <P> "Now the (toothless) platypus only exists on the eastern river systems," Archer  said. "It has become too specialized, less able to adapt to the changing  environment."  </P> <P> Riversleigh, 160 miles northwest of Mt. Isa, an old mining town, has been  recognized as one of the world's richest fossil deposits, yielding perfect  bones, teeth, skulls and sometimes entire skeletons of creatures that roamed  the continent 25 million years ago.  </P> <P> Since full-scale exploration began at the site in 1983, paleontologists have  unearthed at least 200 new fossil species embedded in the hard limestone.  </P> <P> "Riversleigh has given us a unique picture of about 25 million years of  Australian life," Archer said. "It was our first glimpse of paleontological  paradise."  </P> <P> Using explosives, crowbars and sledgehammers, the scientists have uncovered  relics of meat-eating kangaroos, tiny koalas, marsupial lions, insects, bats  and a giant 25-foot python, which they have named Montypythonoides.  </P> <P> Archer and his colleagues return to the site once a year to dig for fossils.  </P> <P> "Every time we go, we find something new," he said.  </P> <P> Before 1983 scientists knew of fewer than 70 Australian land mammals older than  2 million years, Archer said.  </P> <P> However, the Riversleigh deposits -- the exact locations of which are kept  secret to guard against scavengers -- have turned up more than 200.  </P> <P> "The fossils are giving us information to enable us to interpret the past and,  hopefully, to gauge the future. It is crucial that this body of data be  considered when conservation decisions are being made," Archer said.  </P> <P> Archer still keeps a memento in his study of one potentially earth-shattering  discovery, a well-preserved human molar embedded in rock 15 million to 20  million years old.  </P> <P> "The oldest known human fossils are about 4 to 5 million years old, so this was  extraordinary," he said. "We were jumping with excitement."  </P> <P> This "astounding paleontological discovery," Archer added, turned out to be an  elaborate hoax by one of his colleagues, who had used all his expertise to turn  a recently pulled wisdom tooth into a fake fossil.  </P></p>

			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Greek Elections: Papandreou prepares for power GREECE'S opposition Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) was four points ahead in the opinion polls yesterday, on the last day of campaigning before Sunday's general election. Mr Andreas Papandreou, the Pasok leader, appeared confident of victory, promising at a rally in Athens to make Greece 'a modern, democratic state that will stamp a seal of peace and co-operation on the Balkan region'. Support for Pasok appeared to have stabilised at around 45 per cent, against about 41 per cent for the conservatives, according to polling organisations in Athens. This result would give the Socialists a clear majority in the 300-member parliament. Political Spring, the conservative splinter group founded three months ago by Mr Andreas Samaras, the former foreign minister, was projected to win at least 5 per cent of the vote and a dozen seats. Mr Papandreou also stressed yesterday that Greece would 'make no concessions' in foreign policy under a Socialist government, ruling out a compromise in the dispute with Macedonia over its name, or in the long-running quarrel with Turkey, a Nato ally, over mineral rights in the Aegean seabed. He promised real pay increases for public sector workers and improved welfare benefits, after a three-year freeze on wage and pensions under the conservatives. Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the prime minister, was due to conclude his campaign with a rally of his New Democracy party in Athens last night. The conservatives have lost most support in the capital, where Mr Samaras's party has attracted younger voters, according to the polls. The election campaign has been the biggest, dirtiest and most expensive media advertising war in the country's history, Reuter reports from Athens. An estimated Dollars 13m was spent in September alone, according to the Media Service company. Negative campaigning and personal attacks were seen as a logical result of the widespread perception that the weakest points of Pasok and New Democracy were their leaders, both aged 74.</p>

			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Letter: Green shoots pulled up Sir, As a small business encouraged by the 'green shoots' press, I want to export some art. For 11 days I have been telephoning Mr Heseltine's department and his own office to get the paperwork but they will not send it. The Department that Terrorises Industry? The switchboard interrogates the caller before putting them on hold and losing the call. I assume they are British Telecom shareholders. As a small business I must give up and leave it to the gun makers to get their licences. John Brandler, Brandler Galleries, 1 Coptfold Road, Brentwood, Essex CM14 4BM</p>

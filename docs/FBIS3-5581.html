Russia is now behind the Serbs and is trying to do its  best to defend its traditional ally. In fact, this trend was  already visible after NATO threatened to bomb the Serbs. Russia  strongly opposed the threat and insisted that the settlement of  the Bosnian conflict be referred to the UN Security Council. If  the proposal is approved, Russia would certainly use its veto  power to defend the Serbs. [passage omitted]    There are several reasons why Russia, which earlier  supported  the West, is now defending the Serbs. First, the Serbs are a  traditional ally of Russia. Although Russia is no longer the  godfather [preceding word in English] of its former satellite  nations, it is still obligated to defend the Serbs, who used to  be part of its hegemony.    Second, Russia appears to have been angry that it has  totally  been ignored by the West in the Bosnian conflict. The NATO  ultimatum, for example, was obviously issued without taking  Russia into account. Russian generals feel that Russia, a  former superpower and former leader of the defunct Warsaw Pact,  has been ignored by NATO. Accordingly, they have tried from the  very beginning to obstruct NATO actions.    Third, in the context of international politics, Russia  wants  to "reemerge" as a superpower by showing its opposition to the  Western scenario in the Balkans. The fact that its economy has  collapsed and domestic politics is in disarray is one thing,  while involvement in an international conflict is another. In  any case, Russia still has military strength that needs to be  reckoned with.    The Serbs are, of course, exploiting such a situation. They  believe that the West--half-heartedly and irreversibly dragged  into the conflict--will think twice before crushing them if  Russia is involved on their side.    Of course, Russia will not intervene hastily because it has  to be cautious toward the United States and Europe, whose  assistance is by all means needed to support the reforms in  Russia. Regardless of this, the Serbian policy of using Russia  as a "shield," may, however, complicate the situation in the  Balkans.    Even NATO, the United Nations, and the United States  continue  to have different views about the best way to settle the  conflict. NATO's "unanimous" decision to give the Serbs the  ultimatum was in fact not made easily because each NATO member  feels that it has a better way to settle the conflict. Thus,  imagine what will happen if the Russian factor is actually  played in the delicate Bosnian conflict! Obviously, such a  situation will benefit the Serbs the most.</p>

			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LAGUNA HILLS CANDIDATES UNITED ON TWO ISSUES  </P> <P> The 14 candidates who want to be elected to the city council of Laguna Hills,  if such a city is formed, agree on one thing: Stop plans to build a large  business park that would dump 42,000 vehicles a day on already-congested roads  and prevent commercial use of the airport at El Toro Marine Corps Air Station.  </P> <P> In a poll taken at a candidates forum at Leisure World last week, all 13  candidates present said they would oppose a plan to change the zoning from  recreation and open space to commercial on 192 acres next to the retirement  community.  </P> <P> One candidate, Bernard Kuai, said his opposition was "qualified," meaning that  he believes that the city will have to settle for a compromise with the  landowner.  </P> <P> And Karl Gustav Schneider II, who was absent from the forum because of upcoming  hand surgery, said later that he also believes that, in reality, some kind of  development will occur. But he said he believes that as a city, Laguna Hills  would be in a better position to negotiate a less-intense development plan.  </P> <P> All 14 candidates also oppose the addition of commercial jet flights at the El  Toro Marine base, although they differ as to whether they believe that the  opposition of the new city would significantly influence the decisions of  county and federal officials.  </P> <P> The most fundamental difference among the candidates is their support or  opposition to the campaign to make Laguna Hills a city.  </P> <P> Four candidates -- Dr. William A. Honigman, Kuai, Leon A. Bosch and Bea Hassel  Rogatz -- want to quash the cityhood drive, although they say they would be  willing to serve on a council if a city is formed. Bosch and Rogatz, both from  Leisure World, contend that the retirement community does not stand to reap any  benefits from incorporation.  </P> <P> While they have taken similar stances on the issues that mean most to the local  voters, the candidates differ broadly in political and professional experience.  </P> <P> They include:  </P> <P> * Philip S. Borden, a Laguna Hills resident, is an investor and dean of  business administration at California Coast University. A former business  executive and professor, he has masters and doctorate degrees from the Harvard  Business School.  </P> <P> * Bosch, a Leisure World resident, is a retired professor and management  consultant. He has served for 12 years on various Leisure World homeowner  association boards and is past president of the Golden Rain Foundation, which  operates the retirement community's facilities.  </P> <P> * Melody Carruth, a Nellie Gail housewife, is a former teacher and founder and  former co-chairwoman of Citizens to Save Laguna Hills, a group that has  advocated the formation of a Laguna Hills city. She is also a member of Airport  Site Consensus, a regional group of volunteers that is trying to prevent  commercial use of the Marine airport in El Toro.  </P> <P> * James Dukette has worked in Orange County government since 1970. Since 1981,  he has been an administrator at the Orange County Agency on Aging. He is past  president of a homeowners association in Laguna Niguel and an Air Force  veteran.  </P> <P> * Norman F. Garton, a retired Navy rear admiral, serves on committees of three  homeowners associations in Leisure World, including the Golden Rain Foundation.  </P> <P> * Janice Graham, a former teacher and operator of a bed-and-breakfast inn, is  an educational consultant. She is a board member of the Saddleback Area  Coordinating Council and past president of a county League of Women Voters.  </P> <P> * Patricia Ann Gummeson is a vice president of Mercury Property Management  Inc., a property management company, a director of the Laguna Village  Homeowners Assn. and area adviser to Citizens to Save Laguna Hills.  </P> <P> * Honigman is an emergency-room physician at Kaiser Permanente hospital in  Anaheim.  </P> <P> * Kuai is a businessman and private investor.  </P> <P> * Rogatz, a resident of Leisure World, is a retired stage and television  producer and director and is now a theatrical consultant.  </P> <P> * Schneider has been in the insurance business for 17 years. He is a public  insurance adjuster for Dietz International in Los Angeles. He was formerly  secretary treasurer of a large insurance adjusting firm in New York and helped  to found a private commuter bus service on Staten Island.  </P> <P> * Herbert Schwartz, a Leisure World resident, is a certified public accountant  and former partner in an international accounting firm. He was treasurer of the  Golden Rain Foundation of Leisure World.  </P> <P> * Craig Scott, an attorney, has been an active member of Citizens to Save  Laguna Hills. He ran as a city council candidate in opposition to a previous  proposal to form a regional city of Saddleback Valley.  </P> <P> * Allan Songstad, an attorney specializing in civil business litigation, was  also a co-chairman of Citizens to Save Laguna Hills, and is president of the  Nellie Gail Ranch Homeowners Assn.  </P></p>

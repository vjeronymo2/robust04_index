			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Spanish establishment divided by a reputation: Scandal surrounding the Bank of Spain's governor is changing the face of a nation 'The main activity of the Ibercorp group is speculation and the support of its own share prices. Even if equity is greater than the minimum required  . we have doubts about the viability of Ibercorp.' Bank of Spain inspectors report, February 6, 1992. 'At its last inspection Banco Ibercorp did not have any problems and no shortfalls of any kind  .. the bank was found to be in perfect condition.' Mariano Rubio, Governor of the Bank of Spain, to parliamentary committee, February 20, 1992. GOLF partners will sometimes joke that Mr Mariano Rubio, the governor of the Bank of Spain, has a handicap which does not always reveal what a good player he is. But none of them thinks of him as a liar. Nevertheless, when he sits before a parliamentary committee in Madrid today to explain how, in February, he told them that a bank under his supervision was 'in perfect condition' when his inspectors quite plainly thought it was not (and which two weeks later collapsed) he will be fighting to salvage one of the most distinguished reputations in Spanish public life. The scandal that ruined Ibercorp has already destroyed any chance of Mr Rubio being re-appointed governor for a third term next month. It has buried a social and financial establishment and begun a media war which threatens to reshape Spain's opinion-making machinery. Mr Rubio has already explained that his testimony in February was technically correct. The Ibercorp group's bank, at the time, had assets worth more than its liabilities and as governor he was never going to suggest in public that a bank might be in trouble because the inevitable result was that it would be. But the scandal has deeper roots. On February 12, the young newspaper, El Mundo, claimed that Mr Rubio and a host of society figures had been favoured in a share transaction made by Ibercorp's president and founder, Mr Manuel de la Concha and his partner, Mr Jaime de Soto. Mr de la Concha had been a close friend of the governor (and his broker) for 25 years. A former stock exchange chairman, Mr de la Concha and Mr Soto had been given a banking licence by the Bank of Spain to open a small bank in the late 1980s when Mr Rubio was granting a string of similar licences. El Mundo reported, in a story subsequently confirmed by the stock market commission, that funds being managed by Mr de la Concha on behalf of Mr Rubio and Mr Miguel Boyer, a former finance minister, and members of their families, had been invested in an Ibercorp subsidiary, Sistemas Financieras (SF). In the spring of 1990, SF suddenly accumulated large amounts of its own stock. Investigating this, the commission asked Ibercorp for a list of the people who had sold SF shares back to SF. The list was incomplete and a second list, supplied under pressure, revealed that someone had deliberately omitted Mr Rubio's name from the first list and disguised the names of Mr Boyer and his wife, Mr De Soto and Mr de la Concha and members of his family. The SF share price collapsed soon after it had accummulated its own stock. Thus Mr Rubio and the others had been able to get rid of their stock while lesser shareholders in SF were abandoned to their fate. Both Mr Rubio and Mr Boyer insist that they did not know their names were being omitted and altered and Mr Rubio insists that he did not interfere with Mr de la Concha's handling of his modest Dollars 120,000 (Pounds 66,000) portfolio. Mr Rubio's association with Mr de la Concha was poorly judged but easy to understand. They were at university together and, like many young men at the time, disliked both the Franco dictatorship and its radical opponents. It was they who became the capitalist, modernising elite in Spain towards the end of the dictatorship and who - as an informal network of civil servants, financiers and businessmen - oiled the wheels of economic reform after Spain became a democracy. Newly free and hungry for glamour, the media dubbed a core group of these reformers los butiful. But the past three or four years have seen new faces take the high ground in Spanish business life. Two newcomers, in particular, have shaken the establishment - Mr Mario Conde, who was appointed president of one of the country's biggest banks, Banesto, in 1988, and Mr Javier de la Rosa, a Catalan entrepreneur who partnered the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) in a Dollars 5bn investment drive in Spain in the late 1980s and who is now the country's most powerful individual investor. As convenient new arrivals, these two have been blamed, in certain newspapers supporting the governor, for starting a campaign to unseat Mr Rubio. This conspiracy theory is full of holes, though, and ignores the fact that Ibercorp was well known for the number of people who joined and quickly left it. What the conspiracy theory does do is concentrate a fierce media battle around Ibercorp as establishment newspapers and magazines have rushed to try and fault El Mundo's campaigning journalism. This war reached its zenith on May 31 when the imperious El Pais, until then regarded as being above petty rivalries, published a long editorial, attacking El Mundo. With El Pais having jumped off its perch to attack his accusers, Mr Rubio could not have found a more powerful ally when he goes before MPs today.</p>

			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> CHEF TO CARVE ICY CENTERPIECE FOR HOTEL  </P> <P> For hotel chef Shuichi Konno, ringing in the New Year in Southern California  will mean laboring for hours carving a 340-pound chunk of ice.  </P> <P> The result -- the number 90 surrounded by an array of delicately-carved birds,  flowers and palm trees -- will form the centerpiece of celebrations at the  Irvine Marriott hotel, where the 40-year-old Konno works.  </P> <P> Konno, 40, said he moved with his family from Japan, where he was also a chef,  to the United States in 1978 because "this country offers more options to  prepare and satisfy a variety of foods and tastes."  </P> <P> Once here, the award-winning chef said he became fascinated with the art of ice  carving, and learned it from a friend in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Konno also prepares his creations for birthday parties and weddings. A kissing  couple or a pair of icy cold hearts are designed for wedding receptions, while  the age of the person usually adorns a food table for birthday parties.  </P> <P> In February, Konno will return to Japan to compete in the World Championship  Ice Carving Competition.  </P> <P> "We will have 48 hours to carve 20 blocks of 300-pound ice," Konno said.  "Whoever creates the most spectacular design in that amount of time wins."  Although Konno isn't disclosing exactly what his creation for the competition  will be, he admits he has a preference for the Chinese firebird.  </P> <P> "You can do a lot with ice, so I try to not limit myself," Konno said. "But the  Chinese firebird is such a proud bird, I most enjoy working on it no matter how  many times I create one." ALLISON SAMUELS  </P></p>

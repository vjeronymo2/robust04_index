			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Dehaene government sworn in MR Jean-Luc Dehaene has been sworn in to succeed Mr Wilfried Martens, western Europe's longest-serving leader, at the head of Belgium's centre-left government. After he and 15 other members of a slimmed-down cabinet were sworn into office by King Baudouin at the weekend, Mr Dehaene, 51, said he had tried, but failed, to find a ministerial post for his fellow-Flemish Christian Democrat and long-time mentor, Mr Martens. He had faced opposition from his party rank and file which wanted a change after the eight Martens' governments over the past 13 years. Continuity of a relatively restrictive fiscal policy and modernisation of Belgium's financial structure is assured by the fact that Mr Philippe Maystadt, a French-speaking Christian Democrat, remains finance minister. But little change is generally expected from a ruling coalition containing the same four French and Flemish-speaking Christian Democrat and socialist parties as its predecessor. Now Belgium has a proper government for the first time since November 24, Air France's acquisition of a stake in Sabena, the Belgian state carrier, is likely. The Martens government was unable to decide on the deal, but Mr Bernard Attali, head of Air France, said yesterday he was sure it would soon go through.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Officially, Skopje appears intransigent, but  according to a report from Skopje by an ET-3 [Athens Television  Network] correspondent, it may soon show prudence and a  willingness for reconciliation.    [Begin Bambis Bikas recording] A high level diplomatic  official and main member of Skopje's negotiating team, who did  not want to be identified, told ET-3 exclusively that the three  Greek conditions have been accepted for some time, and that  Skopje is ready to discuss all issues under dispute with Greece.    In a private discussion, this distinguished diplomat and  close associate of [Macedonian] President Kiro Gligorov outlined  the direction that relations between the two countries will  follow. He said we should leave behind the period in which the  symbols of our differences prevailed, allow time for tensions to  relax, soften our voices, and view the issues in their real  dimensions. He added: The U.S. recognition ended a cycle and  leads things in the above direction. A move by our side will  soon induce the Greek side to move accordingly, but Greece  should help us by showing practically that it is indeed  interested in improving relations. If the people here see from  the approach of the two sides that they will have specific  gains, then they will think it is to their benefit for Skopje to  make an offer to Greece.    Finally, this high level diplomat of the Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia told us that the government of Andreas  Papandreou and the ministry of Karolos Papoulias really want the  two sides to move toward defusing tensions and normalizing  relations. He stressed: We know there is a willingness for  something like this, but first there should be a reduction of  tension, less shrill tones, and then a resumption of  negotiations. There will be a jointly accepted solution to all  unsettled issues. Anyway, no one is interested in the flag with  the Star of Veryina, a symbol which our people do not associate  with very much. Regarding the name, we can easily agree on a  compromise solution, without a winner or loser, which will  benefit both peoples, provided the above cooling off period is  allowed. [end recording]</p>

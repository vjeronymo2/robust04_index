			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / People: Barclays Life reflects On the principle that clearing bank managers and smooth-talking life insurance salesmen never mix well, Barclays has decided to hire a thoughtful consultant, Jeremy Goford, as managing director of its fast-growing Barclays Life operation. Goford, 46, has been poached from Tillinghast, one of the largest life and general insurance consultancy firms in Europe, where he was vice president. Having trained as an actuary with Equity and Law, he joined Mike Tuohy and Chris Smart in 1973 to establish Tillinghast's London office. Apart from a two-year stint as Skandia Life's finance director, Goford has spent the bulk of his career with Tillinghast. A member of the Council of The Institute of Actuaries, Goford's major professional contribution is a paper on 'The Control Cycle - the financial control of a life assurance company' which has become a reference document for actuaries. He has spent a considerable amount of time measuring the profitability of insurance products. Barclays has been slower than some of its rivals, particularly Lloyds Bank, to break into the lucrative life insurance market. Unlike Lloyds, which acquired Abbey Life, Barclays decided to build its own life operation partly because it felt that by growing its own operation there was less chance of it alienating the managers of its 2,500 high street branches, its main sales outlets. 'One of the fears of bank managers is what happens when a life insurance salesman gets hold of their customers' says Goford. He intends to address these fears by focusing more closely on what customers need rather than what they can be sold. Given his experience as a consultant rather than a salesman, he believes that he can make the job of marketing life insurance 'less intrusive'. Last year, Barclays Life increased its sales by 18 per cent. With 1500 representatives in the field and assets of Pounds 1.5bn, it is already one of the bigger insurance companies. Goford is taking over from John Little, who has been doing the job on a temporary basis and who will remain a director of Barclays Life. ***** Sir John Banham, outgoing director general of the Confederation of British Industry, is to become a non-executive director of National Westminster Bank from July 1. Sir John, who leaves the CBI at the end of this month, is to chair the proposed new Local Government Commission. He will also take up non-executive directorships at National Power and Tarmac from the beginning of July. In 1983, Sir John was appointed Controller of the Audit Commission and became director general of the CBI in 1987. ***** Ray Pettitt, 55, who is retiring after ten very active years at the helm of Minet, the international insurance broker, may firmly dismiss any future role at the troubled Lloyd's insurance market. But he could be a useful man to have around at Lime Street as the market's bosses grapple with rebel Names. Minet Holdings became ensnared by scandal in the early 1980s, when executives from the group's then subsidiary, the PCW managing agency, were accused of siphoning off cash belonging to Lloyd's Names. Pettitt, who had spent much of his working life in Nairobi building up Minet's African subsidiaries, was drafted in to clean up the mess. And he has also had some corporate finance experience - which could come in handy for a market seeking to attract 'corporate capital'. In 1988 he was involved in negotiations which ended in the sale of Minet to its current owners, The St Paul Companies, a Minnesota-based insurance company - the first time any Lloyd's broker has been sold to an insurance company. Minet is looking to the younger generation for a replacement. Peter Christie, 45, is a specialist in liability insurance. Christie has been with Minet since 1968. He was appointed group managing director and chief operating officer in June last year. Pettitt will continue in his role of non-executive chairman until the end of October.</p>

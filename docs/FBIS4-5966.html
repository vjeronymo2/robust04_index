WTO was  established from the final act adopted from the ministerial  conference on Uruguay Round in Marrakesh last week.    Malaysia was represented by the minister of international  trade and industry, Datuk Sri Rafidah Aziz. She said for  Malaysia, the WTO agreement was signed subject to ratification.  Malaysia will be an original member of WTO when the agreement  comes into force.    Speaking at a news conference at her ministry in Kuala  Lumpur  today, Datuk Sri Rafidah said Malaysia will play an active role  in the work of the preparatory committee. This will ensure that  the WTO will take into account the concern and interest of all  members within the scope and mandate of the WTO's (?wield). She  pointed out that Malaysia, together with ASEAN and other  developing countries, resist the inclusion of extraneous issues  such as labor standards or social clause into the work program  of the WTO.</p>

Ngonhamo said the list was handed in at the Unomoz  headquarters' reception in Maputo, but the people who received  it there did not pass it in time to the Unomoz Technical  Demobilization Unit.    The Renamo senior official early this afternoon left for  Maringue where he will select a group of 25 officers from his  movement to take part in the second leadership course for the  future Mozambique armed forces. He also revealed that Renamo  troops have already begun to be transferred to the Dondo and  Manhica training centers to join the new unified army.    Ngonhamo pointed out that preparations for the beginning of  a  military logistics course in Maputo and the training of marines  at Catembe are already at an advanced stage. Ngonhamo also said  that his movement now possesses a complete list of men for a  special forces course in Nacala.</p>

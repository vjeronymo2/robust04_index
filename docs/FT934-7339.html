			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / International Company News: Ericsson posts nine-fold advance ERICSSON, the Swedish telecommunications group, yesterday unveiled pre-tax profits of SKr569m (Dollars 69m) for the third quarter of 1993, a nine-fold increase from SKr63m in the same 1992 period. Surging sales and intensive cost cutting lie behind the upturn, which drove up profits for the first nine months to SKr1.86bn from SKr122m. A strong improvement in the company's performance is expected in the final three months, when the impact of the 25 per cent drop in the value of the krona will be felt more strongly as hedging programmes expire. The company expects its 1993 result will be 'somewhat more than double' last year's SKr1.3bn level. However, many analysts had been more bullish, looking for profits of around SKr3.5bn, and they were disappointed by the company's cautious tone. The group's B shares dipped SKr1 to SKr412. Nine-month sales jumped 41 per cent to SKr42.4bn from SKr30.2bn, while orders climbed 30 per cent to SKr49.2bn. The weaker krona accounted for 10 per cent of the orders increase, and 20 per cent of the sales rise. The group now has an order backlog of SKr45.6bn, after increasing its order intake for the last eight quarters. The biggest sales growth came in Ericsson's radio communications division, where surging sales of mobile phones lifted sales to SKr16.9bn from SKr9.3bn. In the third quarter the unit's sales doubled to SKr6.24bn. Overall sales in the third quarter were SKr15.0bn, compared with SKr9.7bn. There has been a particularly strong development in China, Ericsson's fifth most important market after the US, Italy, Sweden and the UK. The Chinese market continues to grow, although the group anticipates increasing problems with the financing of some orders.</p>

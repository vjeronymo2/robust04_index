			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Viodelda Barrias] </F>   [Text] Carlos Ernesto Gonzalez Ramirez, general  coordinator of the government's Technical Negotiating Unit,  which is responsible for Panama's incorporation into GATT, has  said that with the exception of Nicaragua, Panama has the  highest tariffs in Latin America with an average of 40 percent.    The Panamanian negotiator presented an analysis to the  members of the Chamber of Commerce and Industries of Panama on  the "Negotiation of Panama's Incorporation into GATT" which  concludes that the Panamanian service sector receives too much  protection.    The expert emphasized that the service sector receives too  much protection [sentence as published]. He explained that  according to the analysis, the service sector is protected in  two ways: the prohibition of retail sales and the protection of  various professions, which means that a large portion of trade  and services are protected from foreign competition.    Gonzalez Ramirez added that state monopolies of services  such  as electricity, ports, water, and communications are also  protected.    The official said that Panama's incorporation into GATT will  provide great benefits, but entry requires that the country  grant some concessions such as the gradual elimination of export  tariffs [aranceles a la exportacion].    Gonzalez Ramirez explained the main benefits of GATT  membership: For the first time Panama will have a foreign trade  strategy; exports will be based on the security of law; and  market opening negotiations for our products will be held,  especially for services. He also indicated that the fiscal  exemptions granted on the basis of laws that promote industry  and agriculture represent unearned income for the treasury  estimated at 150 million balboas.    Since 1947 Panama has participated as an observer in the  GATT  negotiation rounds, but according to Gonzalez Ramirez, there was  no real interest in joining the organization because "we are not  an exporting country." Panama currently meets all requirements  set forth by that organization for membership.    Regarding the Uruguay Round negotiations, Gonzalez Ramirez  stated that tariffs on industrial goods in industrialized  countries will fall by more than one-third, and more than 40  percent of imports will have free rates [tasas libres].  Meanwhile, trade distortions due to subsidies and import  barriers must be reduced in six years. Domestic subsidies for  agriculture will be reduced by 20 percent. Subsidized exports  will be cut by 36 percent in value and volume. All import  barriers will be converted into tariffs and must be reduced by  some 36 percent.    In the meantime, the United States has asked Panama to join  the Multilateral Trade Agreement and pass the bill on  intellectual property rights, which are key requirements for a  free trade agreement between the countries.</p>

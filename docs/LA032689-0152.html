			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEAR EAST FEAST;  </P> <P> ROAST LAMB FARES WELL WITH BULGUR, SPINACH AND SHIITAKE MUSHROOMS  </P> <P> TWO STAPLESof Middle Eastern cooking since earliest recorded history, lamb and  bulgur, seem to have a natural affinity. Bulgur -- wheat that has been cooked,  dried and coarsely ground -- has a rich, nutty taste that blends well with  lamb's distinctive flavor.  </P> <P> These days, nutritionists are particularly fond of bulgur as a good source of  fiber. Tabbouleh, the Middle Eastern salad, was the inspiration for the  following recipe, best made with leftovers from a roast leg of lamb. Serve with  Middle Eastern cracker bread and a green salad.  </P> <P> LAMB WITH BULGUR, SPINACH AND SHIITAKE MUSHROOMS  </P> <P> 1 cup bulgur  </P> <P> 1 (14 1/2-ounce) can beef broth  </P> <P> 1 bunch fresh spinach  </P> <P> 4 fresh shiitake mushrooms  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon olive oil  </P> <P>  1/2 cup chopped onion  </P> <P> 1 clove garlic, minced  </P> <P> 2 tomatoes, peeled, seeded and diced  </P> <P> 1/4 cup toasted pine nuts  </P> <P> 1 cup cooked, diced lamb  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon fresh oregano leaves  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> Crumbled feta cheese  </P> <P> Rinse bulgur, drain well and place in large mixing bowl. Stir in boiling broth  to cover, place towel over bowl and set aside for 30 minutes.  </P> <P> Clean and remove stems from spinach leaves. Chop coarsely. Remove stems from  mushrooms and discard. Chop mushroom tops coarsely.  </P> <P> Heat olive oil in skillet, add onion and garlic, and saute a few minutes, just  until onions soften. Stir in spinach leaves and mushrooms. Cook, stirring,  until spinach wilts and mushrooms begin to soften.  </P> <P> To bulgur, add spinach mixture, tomatoes, pine nuts, lamb and oregano, tossing  lightly to mix well. Season to taste with salt and pepper.  </P> <P> Turn mixture into oven-proof casserole, and bake at 350 degrees 20 minutes.  Sprinkle with feta cheese, and cook 10 minutes longer or until heated through.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Candidate of Economic Sciences I. Kononov, </F> leading scientific staffer at the All-Russia Scientific Research  Institute of Agricultural Economics, and comment by Aleksandr  Gavrilyuk: "Is the Bank No Comrade for the Peasant?"]    [Text] Our statistics are always late. That is why today  we have not the year's balance for 1993 but only the  agricultural enterprises' balance for the first half of the year.    The consolidated half-year balance of Russia's agricultural  enterprises is a unique document making it possible to assess  objectively the financial position of the country's agriculture.  Over the first six months of work this year, agricultural farms  and producers (not counting private farmers) earned over 567  billion rubles [R] in profit, which is a little over eight times  more than for the corresponding period last year. The profit  obtained ensured a 48-percent profitability in agriculture. Is  that enough?    According to the criteria of the "stagnation times," the  optimum level of profitability was considered to be 40-45  percent of the prime cost of the output sold. And that level  was indeed close to the optimum since it ensured a quite rapid  rate of expanded reproduction of the sector's material and  technical base and ensured wages entirely comparable with wages  in industry (on state farms it was 86-88 percent of industrial  wages). When assessing the present profitability situation in  agriculture we must bear in mind that it took shape largely  under the influence of the extremely reduced remuneration of the  labor of rural commodity producers.    In the first half of this year, as last year, the monthly  wage in agriculture did not exceed 56 percent of the average  wage of workers and employees in the Russian national economy.  If wages in agriculture were the average for the national  economy, then the sector's profitability would decline many  times over for this reason alone. According to the figures for  last year, this decline would have been only threefold. The low  return has also affected effective demand.    Because of the reduction in agriculture's effective demand  for 1992 alone compared with 1991, deliveries of mineral  fertilizers to Russia's agro-industrial complex were nearly  halved, deliveries of tractors and trucks fell by over one  third, deliveries of grain combines fell 28 percent, and volumes  of capital investments were cut back more in the agro-industrial  complex than in other sectors.    Unfortunately, agriculture remains an unattractive sphere  for  private investors. And that is entirely natural. After all,  the general rule has it that there is some point in investing in  production only if you can obtain a bigger clear profit (after  the deduction of tax) than by keeping the money in the bank.  But even the Savings Ban of Russia, which pays the smallest  rate of interest among other banks on short-term investments,  pays 120 percent a year.    Many banks have paid shareholders dividends for 1993 which  amount to 200-250 percent a year and even more. For that reason  banks keep as far away as possible from agriculture, calling it  a "black hole."    Russia's commercial structures mainly finance those projects  whose profitability will in any circumstances be at least  150-200 percent a year. Targets for investment as a rule are  trade and large industrial enterprises which have completed  privatization and possess a substantial export potential.    Consequently, for agriculture to be able, under stagflation  conditions, to make capital investments in more or less  tolerable volumes and to offer normal wages and finally become a  sector of interest to private capital, its profitability should  not lag substantially behind profitability in other spheres of  the economy. For instance, in the United States the average  return over many years from investment in farming for 1954-1992  was considerably higher than from investment in state bonds and  treasury promissory notes.    The half-year figures are also alarming in connection with  the intensifying differentiation of farms. According to the  results of work in the first six months, over 4,000 farms, or  15.4 percent of their total number, became loss-making, and the  average loss from one loss-making farm was about R10 million,  while the profit from one profit-making farm was R27 million.    Last year 7.6 percent of the total number of farms completed  the first six months with a loss. Of course, if you assess the  situation from liberal market positions, there is nothing  dangerous in agriculture's financial position. After all, the  well-known "500 Days" program already made full allowance for  the possible bankruptcy of up to 25 percent of farms possessing  one third of agricultural land. Even now representatives of  this concept view the possible mass bankruptcy of producers of  agricultural output as an entirely acceptable market feature.    In this connection it is appropriate to recall the U.S.  Administration's approach toward problems of its own  agriculture. When in the mid-eighties U.S. farmers were gripped  by a debts crisis and about 7 percent of farms were threatened  with imminent bankruptcy, the federal government took steps to  ease the farmers' debt burden. [Kononov ends]  <H5>  In Place of Postscript </H5>   Russia's agrarian sector has been unable to "achieve a  breakthrough" and overcome the production slump in the outgoing  agricultural year. In addition, losses when harvesting this  year's harvest were in excess of 30 percent for many  agricultural crops. The reasons? Primarily "because of the  clumsiness of the country's banking system" and the imperfection  of the taxation of rural commodity producers, specialists  believe.    Debts to the peasants for the grain and oilseed delivered to  state resources were R600 billion as of early December and were  the same amount for stockraising output sold. In addition the  agro-industrial complex has not received about R800 billion  earmarked for it from the federal budget.    Existing taxation, in the opinion of agricultural leaders,  does not encourage their work and is often a curbing factor.  Thus, processing in the agricultural production sphere is  subject to a 32-percent tax.    To all appearances the premise of recent years that the  emergency formation of private farms would resolve all the  countryside's problems, has not been justified. The 270,000  private farms have provided only 8 percent of the total volume  of agricultural production. And how could it be otherwise if  the private farmers have been sent only 34 percent of the funds  earmarked by the state to support this form of farming.</p>

			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Arts: Reputations reassessed - William Packer admires the work of neglected British painters Such is the modern emphasis on youth that we are inclined to forget that talent is not its sole preserve. Too often, it takes a death to remind us just what commitment, experience, gifts and achievement may lie buried in a long and quiet career. Patrick Symons, in Paris last autumn to see the Barnes Collection, stepped carelessly under a bus and was killed. He was 68. Although by then RA, he was hardly widely known. There had been no retrospective at a great public gallery, no tours abroad and but four solo shows in dealers' galleries in more than 30 years. Yet among his peers his reputation stood high for the steadiness and integrity of what he did. He had taught over many years, first at Camberwell where he had studied, and then at Chelsea. In his quiet and modest way, he had been an influence. To look now at his work in its slow and steady development over some 50 years - at the still-lifes, the interiors, the musicians engrossed in present activity, above all at the densely wooded landscapes that were his special subject - is to recognise painting of an order rare enough in his day, and getting rarer every year. To speak of it as modest is to risk that very English vice of understatement. The truth is that its proper modesty, its unaffected, unselfconscious engagement with the work itself, is its greatest strength. For here are no histrionics, no showings-off and, no less important, no shallow sentimentality. Here, rather, is something educated, committed and complete. It is painting founded in the true academic disciplines of observation, analysis and technical probity. In our wisdom we no longer pass on such things to younger artists, yet here, safe with a surprising number of their seniors, the tradition is not yet dead. We should celebrate it while we may, for it is to be found nowhere else. In any other country, Symons would have been a star. Ruskin Spear, also RA, died in 1990 at he age of 79. His too was a painters' painter reputation, his gifts masked by a conspicuous facility and a career committed to the art school studio rather than his own. He taught at the Royal College from the 1940s to the 1970s and it is now clear that his was a formative influence upon the Kitchen Sink painters of the 1950s, and the subsequent emergence of Pop Art in its British manifestation. It is the fate of the great teacher to see his pupils' often lesser talents flourish before his own, and Spear was never acknowledged as he deserved. He was never taken seriously because he seemed never to take himself seriously. It was all very well for a Hockney or a Blake to enjoy himself with pin ups, post-cards, shop-fronts, but that was youthful exuberance. For Spear to work from newspaper photographs, as Sickert had before him, was quite another thing. But how well they last, these extravagant, wry, funny images of daily life: Mrs Thatcher as the bluest rinse of all; the fashion model's teetering walk and scarlet mouth. Above all, what good paintings they are, seen now in the broader working context of pub interiors, market stalls and Hammersmith streets, as lovingly understood and knowingly painted as by any artist of our time. As a painter of daily life, Spear stood alone. Roland Collins, in his 70s, is still with us. He is a topographical artist of a generation later than that of Eric Ravilious and Edward Bawden, yet his work at its best stands direct comparison with theirs. His large gouaches and water-colours take us to Dieppe and Brighton, along the watering places of the Kent and Sussex coasts, and so back to London and, in a particularly splendid sequence of images, to the mews and backstreets of Belgravia in the 1950s. Patrick Symons: Browse &amp; Darby, 19 Cork Street W1, until April 16. Ruskin Spear: Crane Kalman Gallery, 178 Brompton Road SW3, until April 16. Roland Collins: Michael Parkin Gallery, 11 Motcomb Street SW1, until April 15.</p>

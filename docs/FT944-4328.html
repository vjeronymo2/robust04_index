			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Balladur promises 'new EU impulse' The French prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, yesterday promised to try to give the European Union 'a new impulse' during his nation's EU presidency in the first half of next year. In a speech that sought to cool the feverish French debate on Europe, he steered a middle course between the Eurosceptical views of prominent fellow Gaullists like Mr Philippe Seguin, national assembly president, and the Eurofederalism espoused by Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president. Mr Seguin, who led the fight in France against the Maastricht treaty two years ago, returned to the attack yesterday by saying the treaty was 'not immovable' and could be drastically revised by the EU's planned constitutional conference in 1996. To Mr Seguin, who backs his presidential rival, Mr Jacques Chirac, Mr Balladur replied that 'the nation state and Europe should not be put in opposition to each other. . . . because both are needed to build the future'. To Mr Delors' statement this week that only a federalist Europe could combine efficiency with minimum centralisation of the Union, he retorted that the essential was to 'define clear goals and the will to pursue them' without entering 'institutional debates that are often completely theoretical'. If Mr Delors has really decided to stay out of the French presidency race, as his aides indicate, Mr Balladur will have less need to repeat his critical remarks about Eurofederalism and be freer to pitch for more pro-European ground. But a Delors opt-out will by no means remove the conflicting domestic political pressures on the French presidency of the EU, as events yesterday made clear. President Francois Mitterrand used a cabinet meeting to remind Mr Charles Pasqua, hardline Gaullist interior minister, that France had 'given its word' to Chancellor Helmut Kohl that it would do its best to establish his project for Europol, a Europe-wide police network, which Mr Pasqua has been resisting. At the same time, the government exposed its other flank when Mr Jose Rossi, industry minister, signalled to the National Assembly that France was ready to accept an international ban on direct shipbuilding subsidies. Deputies allied to Mr Chirac, who has made continued aid to shipyards part of his presidential campaign, said the government was condemning the yards to a slow death. Mr Alain Juppe, the foreign minister who is the main pro-Chirac 'cuckoo' in the government nest, also made a statement about the increasing 'unsustainability' of French peacekeepers in Bosnia. The domestic politics of the Bosnia impasse have been that no presidential candidate believes any longer that French forces serve a very useful role there, but none wants to open himself to electoral charges of cowardice by openly calling for their withdrawal.</p>

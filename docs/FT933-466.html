			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / M-way levy 'will clog rural roads 'DRIVERS switching from motorways on which charges are imposed will clog rural roads already set for a tripling or quadrupling of traffic, the Countryside Commission, the government's landscape watchdog, has warned in a letter to the Department of Transport. Mr Roger Clarke, the commission's director of policy, hopes research now being undertaken by the transport department will be published. Evidence so far suggests that even a low motorway charge of 1 1/2 p a mile for cars and 4 1/2 p for trucks could lead to a 10 per cent diversion. 'This translates, for example, into an extra 50 per cent to 70 per cent traffic on the A34 parallel to the M6 in Staffordshire,' Mr Clarke said. 'The wider distribution of traffic on to secondary and minor roads could consequently be even more damaging at even higher percentage rates.' Responding to the green paper on motorways, the commission said it did not oppose the principle of charging, but believed any levy should fit into a wider national strategy for traffic demand management. The commission claimed that the motorway network was catering for local traffic. Recent evidence suggests that, on the M25 for example, less than 1 per cent of traffic has an origin and destination outside the south-east, with 55 per cent of cars and 49 per cent of trucks travelling for less than 30 miles. Eighty-five per cent of all traffic is non-motorway, the commission said. So congestion was already worse and environmental costs higher for ordinary roads than for motorways.</p>

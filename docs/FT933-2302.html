			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / US goods evade Vietnam embargo: 'Just about every American consumer product is here' thanks to a brand new air conditioner made by the US company Carrier. Mr Nguyen heads the Americas department at the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry, but his communist government has no formal diplomatic relations with Washington and his country is supposed to be victim of a US economic embargo since the 1975 communist victory in the Vietnam war. But as the air-conditioners demonstrate, the US sanctions are almost wholly ineffective. Hanoi businessmen say the US authorities let the air-conditioners go to Vietnam for 'humanitarian' use in schools and hospitals, which apparently resold them to the Foreign Ministry. Kodak films, Hewlett-Packard computer printers, and even Chef Boy Ardee canned ravioli (microwave-cookable version) are all on sale in Vietnam, although microwave ovens are almost unheard of. Coca-Cola smuggled from Hong Kong, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore - sometimes by way of Cambodia or Laos - is available from Vung Tau in the south to the Chinese border in the north. Vietnam uses Boeing airliners leased from Switzerland or Australia and discreetly painted white. 'Just about every American consumer product is here,' says Mr James Rockwell, managing director of the Vatico consultancy firm which represents US companies as they wait impatiently for the embargo to be lifted. 'I buy Snickers candy bars, Pringle potato chips and Budweiser beer. I buy American shaving cream and American anti-perspirant.' One local entrepreneur has even opened an Apple computer showroom in Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon), the country's commercial centre, where he sells Apple computers imported from France. Motorola telephone handsets are advertised in the press. Presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton have softened the embargo in the last two years, and last week Mr Clinton allowed US companies to compete for projects funded by international financial bodies such as the World Bank. But the basic embargo remains in place in spite of pleadings by US corporations. They presented a brief report to US congressmen visiting Hanoi recently in which they complained they were losing business to their competitors and pointed out that the sanctions were full of holes and encouraged the use of pirated personal computer software. The US embargo is particularly difficult to police because it is unilateral  -Washington is alone in maintaining sanctions - and because US subsidiaries and joint ventures can be found all over Asia. The presence in the US of some 1m people of Vietnamese origin, many eager to do business in their former homeland, makes enforcement even harder.</p>

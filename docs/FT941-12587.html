			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Sinn Fein fails to clarify or unify Twenty-two years ago tomorrow a protest march heading for Londonderry's Guildhall ran into the 1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment and 'Bloody Sunday' became a part of Ireland's historic agony. Yesterday, 3,000 lives later, the same building played out another chapter in the still unfolding drama. In a hall just along from the memorial window commemorating the 13 who died violently on the streets of the Bogside, Sinn Fein's 'peace commission' sat to listen to the public's views on the latest, joint effort by Dublin and London to bring an end to the suffering. The hearing, conducted on quasi-judicial lines, gave individuals and organisations their chance to state their case, though the six-strong commission panel - drawn from Sinn Fein's executive - cut short any attempts to enter into debate. Further sessions are planned for Dublin, Cork and Galway, after which Sinn Fein says it will make public its findings. Those speaking yesterday included community groups from the Bogside ghetto, ex-prisoners and non-affiliated organisations committed to reconciliation. One by one, they offered graphic descriptions of the city's barricade culture or traced the messy history of 'unionist hegemony'. Mr Martin McGuinness, a senior Sinn Fein official and the man identified by security forces as IRA chief of staff, sat quietly in the audience. If the panel had expected ringing endorsement from a partisan gathering for its repeated demands for clarification of the joint declaration, it was quickly disabused. Mr Jon McCourt, from Derry's Peace and Reconciliation Group, wanted to ask if Sinn Fein would clarify what it meant by clarification and whether, if the majority of submissions to the commission demanded an end to violence, the republican movement would respond positively. His questions were disallowed, on the grounds that they constituted a dialogue. Only the commission, he complained later, was apparently allowed to ask questions. Mr John Robb, a former senator in the Irish republic, said that while Sinn Fein demanded that the British government should be seen as a persuader in bringing about a political settlement, the party itself could be persuasive in urging the IRA to end its campaign. He warned that the longer the IRA pursued its tactics, the better armed and better organised the loyalist paramilitaries would become. Mr Tony Carlin, a former mayor of Derry, said the merest hint of a British withdrawal would activate a loyalist campaign of terror. Mr Terry Robson, a teacher at the University of Ulster, was not alone in strident criticism of the two governments. He dismissed the joint declaration, claiming neither party to it had any intention of responding to the demands for national self-determination. As the contributions continued, preparations outside were underway for tomorrow's demonstration, in which thousands will retrace the 1972 march. Yesterday, the families of those killed more than two decades ago called on Mr John Major for a new public inquiry.</p>

			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / International Company News: Cypress in venture with chip-maker CYPRESS Semiconductor has reached an agreement with QuickLogic, a small Silicon Valley chip-maker, that will provide Cypress with a new range of application specific semiconductor products. The companies will work together to develop products, technology and design tools for Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) chips, devices that can be rapidly customised by an electronic equipment manufacturer. For Cypress, the agreement with QuickLogic represents an opportunity to expand its product line into a potentially more profitable segment of the semiconductor market. The deal calls for Cypress to manufacture QuickLogic's FPGA chips, which both companies will then offer for sale. The deal also gives Cypress rights to QuickLogic's current products as well as future products developed by QuickLogic or jointly by the two companies. In return, QuickLogic gets guaranteed production capacity at Cypress.</p>

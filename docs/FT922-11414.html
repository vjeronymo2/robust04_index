			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Recorded gifts IN MARCH you wrote that under certain circumstances probate could be granted but that there should be a record of any gift to the daughter of a beneficial interest in bank and building society accounts. What would constitute a record? A deed, a simple written expression of intent? Could such an expression be revoked subsequently by an express disposition in a will or implicitly by a residuary clause? The idea is to record the fact that the gift has been made; for example by a signed written memorandum stating that there has been a gift of the relevant interest. The gift may be effected either by a declaration of trust or by a formal, written assignment of which notice in writing is given to the debtor (for example the bank or building society). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A SALVADORAN FUNERAL MARCH, WITH MEMORY OF U.S. POLICY  </P> <P> There will be a funeral march in the dry hills of western El Salvador this  week. Wednesday marks the anniversary of the Las Hojas massacre. Las Hojas is a  small Indian village far from the active war zone in this Central American  country, with a distinctive folk culture descended from the Aztecs. On Feb. 22,  1983, an army battalion massacred 74 residents of the area around the village.  </P> <P> Both conservative policy-makers in the Reagan and Bush administrations, and  liberals in the Democratic-controlled U.S. Congress avert their eyes from the  Las Hojas massacre, preferring to argue about such more celebrated matters as  the Nicaraguan Contras in El Salvador. But the massacre is a now-historic event  that serves to strip away most of the deceptions that sustain U.S. policy  toward El Salvador.  </P> <P> The conventional wisdom about El Salvador holds that there has been  human-rights progress. Trained, armed and advised daily by U.S. military  officers, the Salvadoran security forces have killed tens of thousands of  unarmed civilians in the last eight years. Military death squads were  assassinating up to 800 people a month in 1980 and 1981. Since 1983 and 1984,  the number of killings has declined. The government of Christian Democrat Jose  Napoleon Duarte, it was said, was demonstrating limited but real control over  the country's military. The Congress and the White House, in turn, provided El  Salvador with billions of dollars in U.S. aid.  </P> <P> The bipartisan consensus in Washington about the future of El Salvador is now  being tested. The Duarte government has all but vanished in a cloud of  corruption and incompetence. Death-squad killings are again on the rise. Even  Vice President Dan Quayle acknowledged as much on his recent visit. And the  guerrillas' proposal to delay elections, while they enter the electoral process  for the first time, has thrown El Salvador's political parties into disarray.  </P> <P> The massacre story reminds us that Salvadoran realities do not conform to U.S.  rhetoric. In Las Hojas, all the common rationalizations of U.S. policy in El  Salvador were exposed as untrue:  </P> <P>  -- Human rights abuses like the Las Hojas massacre are often difficult to  prosecute for lack of evidence.  </P> <P> The State Department concluded within a few days that the local garrison  commander, Col. Elmer Gonzalez Araujo was responsible for ordering the  massacre. So did a top Salvadoran military commander.  </P> <P> According to a declassified State Department cable, the farmers of Las Hojas  had won a legal dispute with a local wealthy landowner. The landowner then  complained to Gonzalez, who ordered troops into action. The males of the area  around Las Hojas, ages 11 to 73, were taken to a nearby riverbed with their  hands tied behind their backs. All were shot in the head.  </P> <P>  -- Salvadoran military leaders do not condone abuses committed by  lower-ranking officers.  </P> <P>  Within weeks after the massacre, Gonzalez was promoted to head the procurement  agency of the Salvadoran armed forces. Since then, the colonel has never been  demoted or reprimanded by his superiors.  </P> <P>  -- The United States, while it cannot control the Salvadoran military, avoids  dealing with the worst human-rights violators in its ranks.  </P> <P> In May, 1983, three months after the massacre, U.S. military advisers were  helping Gonzalez purchase $4.7-million worth of ammunition with U.S. military  aid from a firm in Virginia. Some U.S. advisers in El Salvador were concerned,  not about dealing with a murderer, but about possible corruption in the  ammunition deal. The deal went through anyway.  </P> <P>  -- When U.S. officials must deal with unsavory Salvadoran officers, they are  extremely careful.  </P> <P>  The fears of corruption were warranted. As was later revealed in U.S. federal  court, Gonzalez and another colonel accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars  in kickbacks from the Virginia firm in return for overlooking the fact that the  ammunition was falsely packaged. According to U.S. prosecutor Theodore  Greenberg, Gonzalez himself pocketed at least $25,000 in U.S. military  assistance.  </P> <P>  -- President Duarte wants to punish flagrant human-rights abusers.  </P> <P>  Duarte personally approved Gonzalez's appointment to head the country's Port  Authority, another job with lucrative kickback possibilities. Gonzalez was  never charged with any crime by Salvadoran civilian officials, much less put on  trial. Several low-ranking soldiers from the garrison near Las Hojas did face  charges for the massacre but were acquitted. A distraught relative of the  victims who dared to complain to local authorities was arrested for disorderly  conduct.  </P> <P>  -- When the Salvadoran courts cannot act, the United States will use its  influence to curb such abuses.  </P> <P>  The phony ammunitions deal resulted in the indictment of three U.S.  businessmen. The Justice Department had sufficient evidence to indict Gonzalez  as well. High-level Justice Department officials, after consulting with the  State Department and the Pentagon, decided not to.  </P> <P>  -- When "quiet diplomacy" fails, the United States will publicly criticize  human-rights abuses.  </P> <P>  In February, 1984, the State Department told Congress that the Las Hojas  massacre had been carried out "apparently by elements of a Salvadoran army  unit." Yet U.S. diplomatic cables had already stated unequivocally that  Gonzalez ordered the killings. The State Department's annual human-rights  reports have failed to mention the Las Hojas case ever since.  </P> <P>  -- Whatever happened in the past, Salvadoran military leaders and U.S.  officials today condemn the massacre of civilians.  </P> <P> In an interview on Salvadoran TV in October, 1986, Gonzalez defended the Las  Hojas killings as a "legitimate military operation." No Salvadoran or U.S.  official publicly disputed his statement. The colonel now heads the Office of  Military Repairs.  </P> <P>  -- Whatever the details of the Las Hojas massacre, the current Salvadoran  government is committed to making sure that such abuses do not happen again.  </P> <P>  A Salvadoran court ruled last year that Gonzalez is now immune from  prosecution under the amnesty provisions of the 1987 Central American peace  plan. The Las Hojas massacre, the courts decided, was a "political" crime that  should be forgiven in order to help bring the civil war to an end.  </P> <P> Still, the war goes on. So does Gonzalez. U.S. military analysts now state the  obvious: The U.S.-backed war effort does not enjoy popular support. The Indians  of Las Hojas will commemorate their loss by marching through the countryside,  holding aloft large photos of the dead.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAMPAIGN TALK;  </P> <P> A WEEKLY WINDOW ON THE CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS.  </P> <P> 3 days left to register to vote before the May 7 dealine.  </P> <P> 36 days left until the June 5 primary election  </P> <P> Reporter shopping: At long last, Democrats Dianne Feinstein and John K. Van de  Kamp have agreed upon their Los Angeles debate -- May 20 at 4:30 p.m. on KCBS.  Insiders note, however, that negotiations between the two campaign staffs  involved efforts at "reporter shopping." The campaigns weighed offers from  rival stations as to which outlets might insist on including their own  aggressive reporters. The agreement signed by the candidates reserves for  themselves and KCBS to pick the panel. The process left a couple of television  journalists feeling blacklisted and others worrying that they might be  perceived as handpicked stooges if they participate.  </P> <P> KCBS News Director Michael Singer said, "My interest in this situation is to  get what I consider the best qualified reporters in this town."  </P> <P> In a separate development, the campaigns changed channels for their May 13  debate in San Francisco. The new agreement calls for the debate to air on  KRON-TV at 8 p.m. This in place of an afternoon session on KPIX.  </P> <P> Political shadings: Wesley Sanders Jr., the treasurer in Compton, is running a  serious but largely unheralded campaign for state treasurer against a candidate  with name recognition and political connections that Sanders can only dream  about. His opponent in the Democratic primary is Kathleen Brown, daughter and  sister of former governors. "I am not a rich man," Sanders said in a recent  speech, "and although I come from a good family, they are not known across the  state."  </P> <P> Then Sanders, who is black, closed his speech with this: "If you insist on  voting for a Brown for treasurer, vote for me. There is nobody running for  office who is any browner than me."  </P> <P> Assembly update: Lynwood City Councilwoman Evelyn Wells walked away with the  California Democratic Council's endorsement for her bid in the crowded 48th  Assembly District primary. Wells was tough to beat: She serves as the council's  controller.  </P> <P> The endorsement will compete with the official party imprimatur bestowed on  Marguerite Archie-Hudson, another of the four Democrats running for the  nomination. Archie-Hudson also has won the moneyed nods of Speaker Willie Brown  (D-San Francisco) and Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), who is  giving up her seat to run for Congress.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, candidate Rod Wright has been organizing a swelling church-based  grass-roots effort. And Los Angeles City Councilman Robert Farrell has hired  San Francisco-based campaign consultant Clint Reilly, who was running Dianne  Feinstein's gubernatorial campaign until a celebrated tiff last summer.  </P> <P> Looking ahead: Cathy Calfo, executive director of the California Democratic  Party and right-hand woman to Chairman Edmund G. Brown Jr., is on her way out.  </P> <P> WHERE THE DOLLARS ARE  </P> <P>  Here are the biggest spenders among nonpartisan special-interest political  action committees and corporations, based on figures from the June 7, 1988,  California primary election.  </P> <P> 1. Insurers PACS: $946,000  </P> <P> 2. California Trial Lawyers PAC: $873,246  </P> <P> 3. California Medical PAC: $827,625  </P> <P> 4. California Real Estate PAC: $463,832  </P> <P> 5. California Correctional Peace Officers PAC: $438,086  </P> <P> 6. California Teachers Assn./Assn. for Better Citizenship: $423,355  </P> <P> 7. Atlantic Richfield Co.: $375,521  </P> <P> 8. Beer Wholesale Community Affairs Fund: $374,370  </P> <P> 9. G-Tech Corp.: $367,000  </P> <P> 10. Bankers Responsible Government Committee: $317,500  </P> <P> </P> <P> Source: California Fair Political Practices Commission  </P> <P> Compiled by Times editorial researcher Michael Meyers  </P> <P> SOUNDINGS  </P> <P> From William Endicott in the Sacramento Bee, commenting on Willie Brown's  opposition to Proposition 119, the redistricting initiative supported by the  League of Women Voters:  </P> <P>  "It's understandable that Assembly Speaker Willie Brown is at odds with the  League of Women Voters. The league believes in good government."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dianne Feinstein, candidate for governor, grousing to water quality officials  when pressed to explain her stand on the Peripheral Canal:  </P> <P>  "Everything that happens in public life is (meant) to lock you into a  position."  </P> <P> EXIT LINE  </P> <P> "These campaigns have become a black box. On one side you put in dollar bills,  and on the other side you run out videotape."  </P> <P>  -- Darry Sragow, manager of Dianne Feinstein's campaign for the Democratic  nomination for governor.  </P></p>

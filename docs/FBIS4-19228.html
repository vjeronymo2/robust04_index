			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Teilo Colley] </F>   [Text] Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind tonight warned  Serb forces in Bosnia to stop interfering with the peacekeeping  activities of UN troops or face tough action.    He said it was too early to know if aggressive Serb  responses  to the NATO bombing of Serb targets in Bosnia were isolated  incidents or part of an overall policy.    But he warned: "The UN would have total support of its  member  states, including the UK, if some action was required to protect  UN personnel."    He was commenting amid reports that UN staff had been  detained by Serbs and that Serb attacks on Tuzla airport had  resumed since the weekend NATO attacks on their positions  besieging the mainly Muslim enclave of Gorazde.    "These incidents will continue to happen, and we shouldn't  be  surprised at that," he told reporters during an official visit  to the United States, where he is attempting to persuade his  Washington counterpart William Perry to send American  peacekeeping troops to Bosnia.    "We can't yet establish whether these were purely localised  or part of a wider pattern.... We don't have the hard  information at this time to know which this is," he said.    But Mr. Rifkind made it clear that he believed the UN would  be prepared to take decisive action to protect the 3,300 British  troops and other UN personnel on the ground in Bosnia.    Earlier, he told Channel 4 News: ``It's crucially important  that the rights of UN personnel in Bosnia are entirely respected  and the Serbs, and indeed others, should be under no illusion  that the UN would have the total support of its member states,  including the UK, if firm action was required to protect UN  personnel.    ``The UN are there in a humanitarian role and in a  peacekeeping role. They cannot be treated in other than a  proper and appropriate fashion and I think there will be no  controversy in Britain or elsewhere if the UN was required to  take tough measures to protect its own people.''</p>

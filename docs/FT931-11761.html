			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Israel to take back 100 deportees: Pressure from US prompts reversal of policy on stranded Palestinians ISRAEL announced last night it would take back 100 of the more than 400 Palestinians it expelled to Lebanon in December and halve the term of exile for the remainder in a dramatic reversal of policy prompted by intense pressure from the US. The 396 deportees still stranded in south Lebanon, all alleged Islamic fundamentalist militants from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, said before the decision they would not accept any solution except full compliance with United Nations Security Council resolution 799 calling for the immediate return of all those expelled. But Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, made clear the concessions were part of what he called 'a package deal' which would ensure that the US blocked any further action against Israel in the Council over the issue. Mr Rabin, who until yesterday publicly refused to back down on the deportations, said Washington had also agreed to press all parties to resume the Middle East peace talks. The Palestine Liberation Organisation had previously said it would not return to talks until the deportees went home. After a special cabinet meeting in Jerusalem, Mr Rabin described the initiative as a difficult step for the government. It originally ordered the unprecedented expulsions to strike against Hamas, a powerful Islamic group in the West Bank and Gaza, and the smaller Islamic Jihad group which had both carried out a series of killings of Israeli soldiers. But the deportations incurred overwhelming international condemnation. 'We had to face the international community, with the reality of a new administration in the US which I believe is friendly towards Israel and we had to create with it an infrastructure of understanding which would enable us in the next four years to exhaust the opportunity of peacemaking,' Mr Rabin said. The Clinton administration had pressed hard for concessions since the Israeli High Court approved the expulsions last week. The US wanted to avoid a confrontation at the UN and to preserve the fragile peace process. Last night at the UN in New York Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said the move made further action on the matter by the Council unnecessary and even counter-productive. Mr Rabin said the returning deportees would be brought back within a few days 'to their previous status' - a return to jail for most. The rest would remain exiled for one year instead of two. Israel would also provide them with humanitarian aid. The EC last night welcomed the Israeli cabinet's compromise as a 'very good step' which would help to put Middle East peace talks back on track, Lionel Barber adds in Brussels. But Mr Niels Helvig Petersen, Danish foreign minister, declined to offer total endorsement of the plan or indicate whether it would lead to a speedy resumption of talks to update the 1975 Israeli-EC trade agreement.</p>

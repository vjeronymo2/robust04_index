			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Arts: The Green Table - Ballet On Tuesday night, the opening programme of Birmingham Royal Ballet's season at the Wells had a schizophrenic air. We saw a light opening piece - Graham Lustig's view of the beau monde in Paramour; three contrasted duets; and Facade. The company then took Dr Jekyll's potion, and closed the proceedings with The Green Table, a work calculated to lower the most sanguine spirits. I understand that Kurt Jooss always wanted Green Table to end an evening, so that audiences might leave with the message still fresh in their minds. It seems wholly unnecessary to perpetuate this routine, and it makes for awful programme-building. The Green Table, after 60 years, has its devotees. It is, as people never tire of telling us, still dreadfully true in portraying the horrors of war. But when, given human stupidity, was this not so? As a 1930s artefact, this anti-war poster has an historic interest. Its message was unprecedented in the dance repertory of its time and place. But unlike Georg Grosz's drawings, which had already explored the theme, its characters are generalisations, its style earnest, and it is riven with a sentimentality that so often corrupts appeals to our better feelings. Its dance language has a certain monumentalism - pose better than step  - and the original principals (most of whom I saw) boasted an emotional and physical weight which lent it credibility. We cannot expect BRB's dancers to reproduce these qualities, albeit performances - notably James Bailey and Timothy Cross as the Standard Bearer and the Young Soldier - are stronger than at the work's revival last October. It is Marion Tait as the The Old Mother (the very names tell you what to expect from the dance) who has the absolutely sure dramatic presence that I recall from the Jooss interpretations of the 1940s. Miss Tait, that valuable, unerring artist, was all elegance in Paramour, and was to look exquisitely true in Kenneth MacMillan's Pavane pas de deux, happily restored to the repertory. This is a serene duet, made for Sibley and Dowell in 1973, whose hushed, ecstatic mood and flowing shapes Miss Tait captures perfectly. Her partner, Kevin O'Hare, has the unenviable task of reproducing movement conceived for Dowell's impeccable line, and he makes it look tense where it should unfurl with the sweetest muscular ease. Pavane comes as a contrast to the bellicosities of Hans van Manen's Twilight. Two lovers stalk each other as sexual adversaries, and Chenca Williams has the vicious legs, the temperament as sharp as the heels on her shoes, to make everything of the choreography. She needs a more provocative partner than Joseph Cipolla, who underplays the man's challenge to her. And to set the house in a roar, that well-known alternative to dancing, the Don Quixote pas de deux. There, to knock spots off the choreography, were Miyako Yoshida, turning like a top, and Tetsuya Kumakawa, who goes up into the air and does things, not least some beautiful slow cabrioles. We saw too much dazzle and too little style - acrobatics can be made to resemble art - but the public likes circus tricks, and was more than content with these dare-devil activities. About Facade, I can only say that once upon a time it was a ballet in which Ashton made stylish comment about dancing. It is now a romp, and pointless. Musically, the evening was pleasing, with an idiomatic account of the Poulenc two-piano concerto from Jonathan Higgins and Ross Williams, and the Royal Ballet Sinfonia under Philip Ellis. Birmingham Royal Ballet continues at Sadler's Wells, with mixed repertory, until Feb 13</p>

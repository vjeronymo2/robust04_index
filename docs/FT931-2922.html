			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Utd Newspapers settles dispute UNITED Newspapers, publisher of the Express and Star national newspapers, said it had settled its legal dispute over distribution with Northern and Shell, publisher of Penthouse and Forum magazines. The row was over the termination of magazine distribution agreements. Under the agreement, Northern and Shell will pay Pounds 17m it owes to United. In return, United will pay Pounds 17m for 10 magazine titles serving the cycling and music sectors. The magazines have net assets of Pounds 96,000 and are expected to make a gross contribution of Pounds 1.7m in the next 12 months. The two sides have also agreed to drop their competing litigation actions over distribution agreements. United said its annual results to be published later this month would show an exceptional provision of up to Pounds 12m to reflect the costs of dissolving the 'uneconomic' distribution agreements and a 'more conservative' valuation of the magazines acquired. The provision will, however, be offset by an exceptional gain of about Pounds 23m following a controversial decision to dispose of some shares in Reuters Holdings.</p>

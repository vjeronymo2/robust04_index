			<p><P> March 27, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SEARS TO SELL DIVISION OF COLDWELL BANKER;  </P> <P> INVESTORS PURCHASE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE UNIT  </P> <P> Sears, Roebuck and Co. today announced the sale of its Coldwell Banker  commercial real estate business to a management group and a group of outside  investors for an undisclosed sum.  </P> <P> Terms were not disclosed for the sale of the nation's largest commercial real  estate company that Sears bought in December, 1981, when it was branching out  into financial services. Analysts said they expected the sale to bring in about  $300 million.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $460 Million in Revenue  </P> <P> Coldwell Banker had 1988 gross revenues of more than $460 million.  </P> <P> Sears said in a statement that the sale was part of its corporate restructuring  plan to strengthen its consumer operations. Sears will retain ownership of the  Coldwell Banker residential real estate business and of the Coldwell Banker  name.  </P> <P> The outside investors include Frederick V. Malek of Washington; the Carlyle  Group, a Washington-based merchant banking firm, and a group of prominent U.S.  and Japanese investors, Sears said in a statement. Financing is being arranged  by Sumitomo Bank and Bankers Trust Co.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Employee Ownership  </P> <P> Sears said a substantial part of the company will be owned by its 5,000  employees, but did not specify the size.  </P> <P> "The enthusiasm and commitment of our employees to participate in ownership of  the company will return its ownership to an employee-based entrepreneurial  direction and validates our existing strategies," Malek said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Largest Retail Chain  </P> <P> Last October, Sears said it planned to sell the commercial real estate  operation. The real estate group, which was founded in 1906 in San Francisco,  has offices in about 100 locations in the United States and Canada.  </P> <P> Chicago-based Sears also operates the nation's largest retail chain and owns  Allstate Insurance and the Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. brokerage firm.  </P> <P> The retail stores have undergone a face lifting, changing to everyday low  prices in a bid to lure customers to Sears' 824 retail outlets.  </P></p>

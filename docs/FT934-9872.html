The group's previous venture, Shakespeare - The Animated Tales, has been sold to 50 countries and recently won two Emmy awards in the US.

Two of the operatic films, The Magic Flute and The Barber of of Seville, were produced in Moscow and the other four - Carmen, Rigoletto, Turandot and Rhinegold - were made in the UK.

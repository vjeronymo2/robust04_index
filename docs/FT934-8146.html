			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Derbyshire force fails audit THE DERBYSHIRE police force has become the first to be refused a certificate of efficiency for the second consecutive year. Mr Geoffrey Dear, HM Inspector of Constabulary, said in a report released yesterday that progress had been made, but without adequate resources problems would continue to grow against a backdrop of rising crime. Derbyshire is the only one of 43 forces in England and Wales to be refused the certificate. Refusal is likely to have no effect in practice - although the home secretary has power to refuse to release funds to the force or send in a commissioner to run it. Mr John Newing, chief constable of Derbyshire, said: 'The crucial issue is one of a shortage of funds, a problem familiar to many police forces.' To stay within budget, he said, the force had to keep 40 police officer posts vacant and 26 civilian jobs had not been filled. He called on Mr Dear to tell the Derbyshire Constabulary exactly what it needed to do to regain the certificate. Mr Dear said people had complained of long police response times, outbreaks of burglary in residential streets and lack of visible patrolling in rural areas. Last year crime in Derbyshire rose by 16 per cent, the second highest rise of any force in the country. Lord Ferrers, Home Office minister, said the force would be allocated an extra Pounds 2m for measures such as additional vehicles and equipment. It had also been given a set of measurable targets.</p>

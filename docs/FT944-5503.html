			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / PM orders end to Euro infighting: Tories told they may lose election Mr John Major issued a stark warning yesterday that the Conservatives would be defeated at the next general election unless the party stops its infighting over Europe. At the end of a week which saw the withdrawal of the whip from eight Tory MPs - with a ninth resigning - Mr Major urged colleagues to 'put the divisions behind us and work for the kind of Europe in which we believe'. In an apparent sideswipe at divisions among ministers as well as on the back benches, he said that Tory supporters expected unity from the parliamentary party and the government. But a row over the funding of the European Union's efforts to combat fraud provided an awkward backdrop to the return to the Commons next week of the legislation which provoked this week's revolt by Eurosceptics. Mr Major told the annual conference of Conservative Women: 'It is perfectly possible for us to win both the domestic and the European arguments - but only if we work together as a party at all levels.' In a tacit admission of the unspoken fears of many in the cabinet that the party is close to fracturing permanently over Europe, Mr Major said economic recovery alone would not guarantee an election victory. He added: 'It is the Conservative party fighting the same fight, at the same time against the same people - then we will win.' The row over EU fraud was sparked when ministers acknowledged that Britain had acquiesced in the cutting of the EU's Pounds 100m anti-fraud budget. Mr Major has pledged initiatives to reduce fraud at next week's EU summit in Essen, Germany, and he has used the government's tough line on spending abuses to persuade rightwingers to back increases in the overall EU budget. Mr Jonathan Aitken, the Treasury chief secretary, said the Pounds 4m reduction was not thought to be 'of the greatest importance' and only affected administration. But Mrs Teresa Gorman, one of the eight rebels who were stripped of the party whip after abstaining in votes on the EU finance bill, said it was 'astonishing' that the fraud budget was being cut. Some of the rebels are considering not supporting the government when the bill increasing Britain's contributions to the EU budget returns to the Commons on Wednesday and Thursday. Both Labour and Mr Bill Cash, a Tory Eurosceptic who supported the government in Monday's votes, have tabled clauses for discussion next week attempting to tie enactment of the bill to more effective anti-fraud measures. Labour also plans to push for a vote on whether MPs should be allowed to debate a wider range of issues than just the principle of the bill. The party believes this would open the door to the tabling of more substantive amendments. Joe Rogaly, Weekend FT, Page I</p>

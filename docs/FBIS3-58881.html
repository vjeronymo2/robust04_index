This does not mean that  terrorism will be completely eliminated, he said, but its arms,  wings, legs, and spine will be broken.    Adressing a meeting organized by the Great Anatolia Group in  Ankara today, Golhan said that the leaders of terrorist groups  are usually not of Turkish origin. He explained that the  separatist organization is being supported from inside and  outside Turkey. The government is determined to fight terrorism  and every support is being extended to the security forces  regarding this issue, he said.    The minister pointed out that the efforts being made abroad  to fight terrorism have also been successful. However, he said,  certain neighboring countries are welcoming the terrorist  organization kicked out by the West, but this will not benefit  anyone.    On the postponement of discharges from the Army, the  national  defense minister said:    [Begin Golhan recording] Turkey is not in the position it  was six months ago. Nor is it in the position it was one year  ago; far from it. There is fire around Turkey. Turkey is  surrounded by fire. Certain elections were held in some of the  countries surrounding Turkey. New leaders were elected. You  read their statements in the press. Today, Turkey is faced with  danger, with a risk potential, more than it was yesterday.  Turkey has decided to get rid of the curse of the PKK [Workers  Party of Kurdistan]. What were we expected to do? Nothing?  [end recording]    Golhan stressed that like all countries in the world, Turkey  will overcome terrorism. He urged terrorists to surrender while  there is still time.</p>

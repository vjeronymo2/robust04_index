			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Pressure grows for cut in interest rates PROSPECTS FOR an early cut in UK interest rates strengthened yesterday after the pound firmed and news of a big rise in long-term unemployment increased pressure on the government to stimulate the economy. Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, also stressed the potential problems for the UK economy when he warned that the confidence of exporters could be damaged by a slowdown in the world economy. Mr Leigh-Pemberton's warnings coincided with news of the increase in long-term unemployment, which was most marked in the relatively affluent south-west, south-east and East Anglia. Sterling rose half a pfennig against a weaker D-Mark to close last night at DM2.885, its highest level in the European exchange rate mechanism since mid-December. In New York it held on to its gains to finish at DM2.8855. The pound's strength encouraged hopes that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, could cut borrowing costs while keeping the pound stable within the ERM. The pressures on Mr Lamont intensified after the Department of Employment said the numbers out of work for 12 months or more stood at 747,000 in January, an increase of 93,000 on the previous three months. Long-term unemployment is at its highest level for three years. The unemployment figures sparked angry scenes in the House of Commons, where Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour party leader, protested that government policies were making life a misery for hundreds of thousands of people. Mr John Major, the prime minister, said the figures were 'extremely unwelcome' but there was 'no easy way' to counter rising unemployment. Mr Lamont has been urged by Conservative MPs and industrialists to cut rates, which have been held at 10.5 per cent for more than five months, in an effort to stimulate the economy ahead of the election. There has been speculation that he will do so either on or around Budget day on March 10, possibly along with Budget measures to cut income tax. The Bank of England is believed to have warned Mr Lamont that cutting rates might be unsafe when the pound is well below its central ERM limit of DM2.95. However, the recent strengthening in the pound - from a low point in early January of about DM2.83 - may provide the chancellor with the arguments he needs to justify a cut in borrowing rates of perhaps half a percentage point. Sterling was helped by a stronger dollar, which led to more international funds flowing out of the D-Mark and reduced the strains on the other ERM currencies. The dollar closed in London against the D-Mark at its highest level for three months, at DM1.6480, for a gain of 2 1/2 pfennigs on the day. In New York it eased to close at DM1.644. On London money markets, the key three-month interbank rate - which shadows base rates - eased   1/16 to close at about 10 3/16 per cent. Speaking at an Engineering Employers' Federation dinner, Mr Leigh-Pemberton said increased world economic uncertainty could affect export performance - one of the few bright spots for the UK economy over the past year. In spite of this, he remained optimistic about a recovery in the second half of the year. The Bank governor's fears on exports were reinforced by Sir John Banham, director general of the Confederation of British Industry. He blamed the 'incessant politicisation' of the economy for hitting consumer confidence. Back from a three-week tour of UK export markets, he said: 'The further you get from London the better the UK economy looks. We are too prone to talk ourselves down and our competitors up.' The Employment Department said long-term unemployment was about half its level of five years ago; among 18-24 year-olds it was at its highest since April 1989, but this was also about half its 1987 level. The figures showed a sharp rise in the number unemployed for more than six months, up 136,000 to 1,338,000 in the three months to January. Overall, the percentage of long-term jobless as a proportion of total unemployment rose just 1 per cent to 28 per cent during the year.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 6/5/1994 -- "The Partnership for  Peace has a special significance for Romania," Gheorghe Tinca,  Romanian minister of defense states in an interview with the  periodical PARLAMENTUL.    "We were the first to sign the document-framework," he  recalls, adding that "Romania's adherence to that programme is  not only a major step, a stage towards the proper guaranteeing  of national security, but it comes to answer also our  determination to fully integrate within European and  Euro-Atlantic structures, an objective fully embraced by all  political parties represented in Romania's Parliament. The  adherence to the Partnership for Peace programme of all  Romania's neighboring states and their commitment to observe the  principles of that programme would be able to provide certain  indirect guarantees for the consolidation of our national  security. That is why we have insisted on the fact that the  Partnership for Peace should be open to all states, for we want  them to take active part in the process initiated by NATO," the  Romanian minister added.    Mentioning that "Romania had already set its aims in the  process of army restructuring, before the initiation of the  Partnership for Peace programme, whose aims are similar to the  programme's objectives," Gheorghe Tinca went on to say that "the  Romanian military doctrine is traditionally a defensive one,  which matches the partnership's norms, while as regards the  army's restructuring, training and techniques, all these are to  face a process of modernization".    "We would say that Romania is viewing the peace partnership  as an instrument to encourage investments, business, and  economic development. In fact it is not by mere coincidence  that simultaneously with the Partnership for Peace much talk is  done about a Partnership for Prosperity. From the very first  statements regarding the Partnership for Peace, Romania's  President Ion Iliescu referred to the need for an economic  partnership, a concept that should be extended not only to the  European continent but to the entire world," the Romanian  minister of defense concluded.</p>

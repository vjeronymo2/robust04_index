			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Planned power deal boosts hopes for coal TALKS within the electricity industry on coal purchases received a boost yesterday when the chairman of one regional company said he hoped to reach agreement with the generators before the end of the government's energy review. Mr John Harris, chairman of East Midlands Electricity, said he believed that non-binding heads-of-terms agreements - establishing a framework for local deals - could be initialled between regional electricity companies and generators before Christmas. There were no large stumbling blocks left, he said. His company would then want to move quickly in bilateral talks with the generators on a contract to take its share of the 40m tonnes already agreed for next year and 30m thereafter. 'We believe it would bring stability to the marketplace and to our customers,' he said. Failure to reach agreement between the regional companies and the generators has left British Coal unable to sign long-term agreements on sales to the generators. Mr Harris's comments are significant because his company is leading talks with the generators on behalf of the regional companies. Although some companies remain doubtful about signing any deals before the end of the review, a decision to do so by East Midlands would provide a powerful stimulus for them to act. Eastern Electricity has already signed a letter of intent with the generators and Dr James Smith, its chairman, said a full deal could be signed shortly. Mr Harris said yesterday that he detected a change of mood among other regional companies in recent days on the heads-of-terms talks, with more companies willing for them to proceed. Meanwhile Mr David Morris, chairman of Northern Electric, joined other chiefs of regional companies who have expressed opposition to delaying the liberalisation of the electricity market as a way of increasing coal sales. He said the delay would not be consistent with the development of a competitive market. Scottish Power results, Page 20</p>

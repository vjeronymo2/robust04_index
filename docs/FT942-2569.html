			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Markets Report: Dollar dives The dollar crashed through its technical support level of DM1.6270 in late trading yesterday when an independent forecaster said it could drop to DM1.50 against the D-Mark by late 1995, writes Motoko Rich. Within half an hour of the European markets closing, the dollar dropped nearly two pfennigs, bringing the day's fall almost three pfennigs in very light trading. The US currency had attempted a rally earlier in the day. But concerns about Federal Reserve Board monetary policy and a jittery Treasury market put the market in a bearish mood. The lira was hardest hit in Europe as the European bond markets were routed. The D-Mark benefitted from a flight of investors to cash. Markets had already built up a downward momentum against the dollar when the US currency extended its losses on reports that an economist at the Conference Board, an independent think tank in New York, saw the potential for a ten per cent depreciation of the dollar against the D-Mark by late 1995. Although the precipitous drop was unusual given a lack of hard news, Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior currency economist, said the markets were just following a normal interbank trading pattern. 'It was a conspiracy of circumstances combined with already bearish sentiment,' he said. 'The headline came out at 4:30 on a Friday afternoon in Europe on a day in which there had been very little trading so the market reacted dramatically.' In the morning the US currency had attempted to retrieve losses made earlier in the week. Short covering after the Swiss national bank sold francs on the forward markets gave the dollar a brief boost but by early afternoon it was slipping back. The dollar was quoted at DM1.6070 in after-hours dealings in London after closing at DM1.6299, down from DM1.6319. It closed at Y103.495 from Y103.335. European bond market weakness hit the lira particularly hard as Italian bonds plunged on fears over Italy's swelling budget deficit and concerns about the debilitating cost of the country's constitutional court decision on pension payments. The D-Mark was the main beneficiary of bond market gloom, holding steady against most European crosses. 'Investors are generally pursuing risk reduction and flying into the relative safety of the D-Mark,' said Mr Avinash Persaud, economist at JP Morgan in London. The German currency closed against the lira at L983.8 from L981.0. It was virtually unchanged against the Danish krone and the French franc. Sterling followed the dollar's late trading fall, losing nearly two pfennigs against the D-Mark to sell at DM2.4610/20 compared its close in London of DM2.4765 and DM2.4805 on Thursday. It had closed at Dollars 1.5195 against the dollar, from Dollars 1.5201. In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided liquidity of Pounds 367m after forecasting a shortage of Pounds 350m. In the futures market, the December Euromark contract ended unchanged at 94.81 and the December short sterling contract closed 93.75 from 93.76.</p>

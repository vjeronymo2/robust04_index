			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / A pervasive influence on the economy: The impact of the retail prices index and the way in which it is calculated THE RETAIL Prices Index has become a pervasive influence in many aspects of the British economy. That is in spite of the existence of various other measures of inflation - such as the GDP deflator, the producer price index for manufactured goods and the pensioner price index - which may have theoretical advantages or be more suited to particular purposes. The RPI has become the dominant measure because it is rapidly available (by about the middle of the next month), is adjusted in scope to reflect changing spending patterns and is protected from undue political interference by an advisory committee that includes independent members. The RPI has an unrivalled effect on the level of pay increases - the average level of pay rises is invariably close to the latest inflation rate. Many wage bargainers, particularly among trade unions, would resist reforming the RPI, but they would probably have little option but to continue to use it as the main yardstick in negotiations. Mr Norman Willis, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said yesterday: 'Mortgage rates are part of the cost of living. If costs go up and are not reflected in the RPI then that would produce a horse laugh.' But Mr Alastair Hatchett, of the Incomes Data Services pay research group, believes negotiators would use the official RPI, however it was calculated. Mr Peter Ball, deputy director-general of the Engineering Employers Federation, said: 'There would be a lot of hot air spoken if the formula changed but eventually people would follow it.' A change in the RPI calculation would present difficulties for a sizeable minority of companies that have negotiated long-term pay deals linked to inflation. Those are far less popular than they were in the late 1980s, but most car manufacturers, including Ford and Vauxhall, still favour two-year deals, as do British Airways and the Civil Aviation Authority. If the method of calculation were to change, there might be argument in some companies over what the second-year rise should be. Mr Hatchett said clauses laying down that inflation would be as calculated at the time of the agreement were likely to grow in popularity, but would be based on the assumption that the RPI as currently constituted would still be available - which was by no means certain. A potentially sensitive area is the impact of RPI changes on social security benefits, including state pensions, unemployment benefit, income support and housing benefit, which are upgraded annually according to the RPI. Any suggestion that the government was trying to suppress statistical evidence of rises in living costs would create a political storm. But in some respects an index excluding mortgage interest would be a more suitable determinant of the level of social security benefits. Regulation of utility prices has also become an important area for the application of the RPI. It forms the benchmark for regulating BT's main prices, for example. The price formulae are being reviewed by Oftel, the telecommunications regulatory body, but it is almost certain that the RPI will continue as the benchmark. Oftel has resisted switching to another index, arguing that RPI is the only inflation measure widely understood. BT and Oftel had no comment yesterday on the merits of excluding mortgage interest payments from the RPI. It is thought, though, that in the long run such a change would have little effect on the company's finances. Ofgas, the industry regulator that devised the formula controlling British Gas's price rises to domestic customers, said it was unlikely to revise the formula if the RPI figure was calculated differently. The RPI similarly plays a central role in the complex formula used for water charges. The Office of Water Services said it was assumed that water companies would have to take account of any new method of calculating the RPI before deciding charges. Investments such as index-linked gilts depend on the RPI for their value. Index-linked gilts showed modest gains in prices yesterday, as investors reacted to the possibility of the proposed change - both the repayment value and the interest on the gilts are linked to changes in the RPI. Prospectuses for index-linked issues have a clause saying that, in the event of a 'fundamental change' in the calculation of the RPI which would have a 'materially detrimental effect' on stockholders, the stock might have to be redeemed. Since the index-linked issues currently trade at a discount to their inflation-adjusted value, that would be expensive for the government. According to the Bank of England there are about Pounds 19bn of index-linked gilts in issue. Since prices excluding mortgage costs are rising faster than the RPI, it would be hard to argue that a change would be 'materially detrimental'. National Savings said its index-linked savings certificates, which rise according to the RPI, would simply adjust to reflect any change in the index's constituents. Indexation clauses also crop up in occupational pensions legislation. Limited price indexation - inflation-proofing parallel with the RPI with a ceiling of 5 per cent - applies to deferred pensions payable to workers who leave a company before retirement age. The same protection will one day be applicable to pensions in payment - legislation is on the statute book but has not yet been implemented. There is a pensioner price index that excludes housing and has consequently been rising more rapidly than the RPI recently. This PPI is not applied to pension benefit, although the changes might mean it would move more closely in line with the RPI.

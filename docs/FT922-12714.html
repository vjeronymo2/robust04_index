			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / World Trade News: Japan's shipyards see rise in foreign tonnage orders FOREIGN ship orders received by Japanese yards rose slightly in tonnage in the year ended March 31 compared with the previous year, an official at the Japan Ship Exporters' Association (JSEA) said, Reuter reports from Tokyo. 'Orders fell in September-March, but we saw reasonably steady growth in 1991-92,' Mr Yuichi Watanabe, JSEA's executive managing director, declared. 'Forecast of 1992-93 orders is likely to be lower on the weaker world economy.' Total orders were 140 ships of 7,234,840 gross registered tons (grt) in 1991-92, against 148 of 7,141,199 grt in 1990-91. 'We still cannot clearly judge the world economy's trend, but expect it to recover by autumn,' Mr Watanabe said. 'Shipowners are judging when to put in tanker orders following the new tanker law.' The new International Maritime Organisation law says that, from July 6, 1995, existing crude tankers of 20,000 deadweight tonnes (dwt) and above and existing product carriers of 30,000 dwt must undergo stricter inspections to prevent oil spills.</p>

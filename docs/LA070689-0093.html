			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 4 DODGERS NAMED TO ALL-STAR TEAM  </P> <P> It will be announced today that four Dodgers have been named to the National  League team for Tuesday night's 60th All-Star game at Anaheim Stadium.  According to team sources, they are pitchers Orel Hershiser and Jay Howell,  second baseman Willie Randolph and catcher Mike Scioscia.  </P> <P> With Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda managing the National League team because the  Dodgers won the pennant in 1988, this year's game will have the most Dodger  representatives -- five -- since 1982. Just to keep things blue, Dodger coaches  Joe Amalfitano, Mark Cresse and Bill Russell will serve as batting practice  pitchers for the National League.  </P> <P> "(National League President) Bill White has a lot to do with the selections,  but I make sure and let him know my picks, too," said Lasorda, who would not  confirm the individual Dodger selections because they weren't due to be  announced until today.  </P> <P> Said Randolph: "This is a credit to some of the great individual performances  we are getting this year. No matter what else, we still have some of the best  players in the game."  </P> <P> For Randolph, the selection was special, this being his first year in the  National League after he made the American League team for five seasons as a  member of the New York Yankees. Before this season, 40 players had the made the  team in both leagues.  </P> <P> It is also special for Scioscia, who is on the team for the first time in his  10-year career.  </P> <P> This will be the third appearance for both Hershiser and Howell.  </P> <P> "The team is always first, but everybody also has little personal goals, and  this was one of mine at the beginning of the year," said Randolph, batting .289  after Wednesday's 3-2 loss here. With just three errors in 80 games, his fine  fielding has also helped the Dodgers lead the National League with 86 double  plays.  </P> <P> "I know that there are a lot of good second baseman in the league, a lot of  established players, and I came in new," Randolph said. "That's what makes this  so nice. I'm glad to be recognized."  </P> <P> Although Scioscia would not comment on his selection before today's  announcement, earlier this week he said he doubted if he would be recognized.  </P> <P> "I don't feel I'm having a good offensive year, and historically, defense and  other things have not been a factor in the selections, so I'm not expecting to  get picked," said Scioscia, who is hitting .246 in 70 games with 20 runs batted  in.  </P> <P> Defense and intangibles must have been a factor this year, as Scioscia has  thrown out 37% of would-be base-stealers (19 of 52) -- not to mention his  handling of the league's best pitching staff.  </P> <P> "I thought I was going good last year at the halfway point, but I wasn't  picked, so I just don't want to think about it," Sciosciaa said earlier. "If  what I do gets overlooked, it gets overlooked. The All-Star game would be an  honor, but I've got two World Series rings and they mean more to me than  anything."  </P> <P> Howell, with a 0.78 earned-run average and 15 saves, has bad memories from his  last All-Star appearance, in Oakland in 1987, when he was a member of the host  A's.  </P> <P> During the pregame introductions he became one of the few home team players in  All-Star history to be booed by his own crowd.  </P> <P> "Yeah, that was me, I was the one," Howell said a couple of weeks ago. "I don't  think many people have forgotten that. It wasn't as bad as it seemed, because  there were a lot of Giant fans there, and they always hate us. And I was just  coming off a tough game on Sunday.  </P> <P> "But it was still weird."  </P> <P> Howell wound up giving up two runs in the game's final two innings and was the  losing pitcher, the start of problems caused by bone chips in his elbow. A  month after the game, he underwent elbow surgery and was done for the season.  </P> <P> "But heck, if they want to pick me again, I'll show up," Howell had said with a  smile.  </P> <P> Hershiser, meanwhile, is going into the game well rested, as he made his final  start before the All-Star break in Wednesday night's no-decision game against  St. Louis. He is 9-7 with a 2.42 ERA and leads the league with four shutouts.  However, he hasn't won in his last two starts, lasting six innings in each,  giving up a total of six runs and 14 hits.  </P> <P> "I would be starting for us on Thursday after the break . . . so I don't know  if I could pitch more than an inning in the All-Star game, if at all,"  Hershiser said.  </P></p>

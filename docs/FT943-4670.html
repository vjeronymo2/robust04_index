			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / International Company News: Two banks bid for Poland's Interbank Deutsche Bank and ABN Amro of the Netherlands have made separate bids to purchase Interbank, an ailing private Polish bank, in response to the country's central bank policy of attracting strategic foreign investors to strengthen private and state sector banks. The two banks are insisting on a 100 per cent takeover of Interbank, which is currently managed by the central bank following a 80bn zloty (Dollars 3m) rescue package involving a bond purchase. Deutsche Bank and ABN Amro are among 10 foreign banks, including Chase Manhattan, which have applied to open wholly owned subsidiaries in Poland. However, the central bank has stopped issuing new licences to local or foreign banks in order to encourage banking rationalisation through takeovers. Deutsche Bank has had a representative office in Warsaw since the autumn of 1989, while ABN Ambro is a shareholder in the IBP Bank, a joint venture with Credit Lyonnais, the Banca Commerciale Italiana, the International Finance Corporation and two local banks. The central bank has made an exception for Dresdner Bank and Banque Nationale de Paris, whose joint application to open a subsidiary in Poland has been accepted and is awaiting finance ministry approval. Dresdner played an important role in Poland's debt reduction talks with the London club of commercial bank creditors, as head of the its steering committee, and the approval is seen as recognising the German bank's contribution to the deal. Due to be signed next week, it will reduce Poland's Dollars 14bn commercial debt by almost 50 per cent. Poland last issued a foreign banking licence three years ago. Nine banks, including Citibank Creditanstalt, operate in the country as wholly earned subsidiaries.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 1 (XINHUA) -- Chinese exporters  are not the only ones that would lose if the country's most  favored nation (MFN) status in trading with the U.S. is  withdrawn, the latest study of the World Bank said today.    "U.S. consumers could end up paying as much as 14 billion  U.S. dollars per year in higher prices resulting from a  combination of costlier substitutes from alternative supply  sources," the study said.    The study "China: Foreign Trade Reform" said that "it  appears that the dislocation in trade flows likely to result  from withdrawal of China's mfn privileges by the U.S. would  range from the dramatic to the disastrous, with the associated  costs high for both parties."    It should be noted, the study said, that it is possible for  China to find alternative export markets to make up for these  losses. China's annual export losses in the U.S. market could be  on the order of seven to 15.2 billion dollars.    This is a decline between 42 and 96 percent for the 15 major  products China exports to the U.S., whose combined projected  losses are between 3.7 and 8.5 billion dollars, with about one  half of this reduction registered in the key clothing and toys  or games group.    Among the 15 major export products of China to U.S. are, in  line of export value in 1990, toys and indoor games, clothing of  textile fabric, footwear, travel goods and handbags, radio  broadcast equipment, fresh or frozen shellfish, made-up textile  articles, and furniture.    "It appears likely that Chinese exports to the U.S. would  face grave difficulty due to major cost disadvantage associated  with U.S. general tariffs," which is 42 percent on average for  the 15 products, as compared with 13.4 percent mfn tariff, the  study said.    "With such a major upward shift in the level of import  duties, Chinese exports to the U.S. will clearly experience a  major decline, and in some product groups, may be completely  eliminated," the study said.    MFN applies to all members of General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade (GATT). The U.S. provisionally granted mfn status to  China, a non-GATT member, in 1973. U.S. domestic legislation  requires the review of China's MFN status on a yearly basis.</p>

			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Brussels and UK close to agreement on border controls THE UK and the European Commission are close to a compromise on the long-running dispute over Britain's insistence on retaining border controls on people beyond the end of this year. The Commission has conceded Britain's right to maintain general spot-checks at British ports of entry, while the UK government has pledged to lighten the controls on European Community nationals, EC and British officials said yesterday. The border issue has proved one of the thorniest questions to resolve in the movement toward a single EC market. Under the Single European Act, all controls on goods, services and people are to be lifted by January 1 1993. But Britain has insisted on guarding its frontiers against the threat of drug-smugglers, terrorists and organised crime. Mr Martin Bangemann, the German commissioner for the internal market, held talks this week with Mr Kenneth Clarke, the British home secretary, in which Mr Clarke presented new proposals for breaking the impasse. 'My feeling is that we can find a pragmatic solution,' Mr Bangemann said in Brussels yesterday. The commissioner said that Britain and the Commission shared the general aim of scrapping controls on the movement of people within the EC. The dilemma was how EC citizens could be identified by British immigration without having to subject their passports to scrutiny or other onerous controls. One solution would be for EC nationals merely to wave their EC passports as they walked through immigration, he suggested. The British authorities would be able to retain controls on non-EC nationals, while also maintaining spot-checks on suspected illegal entrants, he stressed. Mr Bangemann also hinted that earlier Commission threats to bring Britain before the European Court of Justice for maintaining its border controls had been dropped. In effect, both sides had agreed to disagree on their interpretation of article 8a of the Single European Act requiring an end to all controls. Britain has insisted that its vulnerability as an island state is much greater than that of its continental partners and cited the border issue as an example of Commission meddling. British officials have also cast doubt on the effectiveness of immigration controls in southern EC states such as Greece. Despite the prospect of compromise with the Commission on border checks, Britain remains at odds with Spain over the sovereignty of Gilbraltar. This is holding up the long-awaited convention on strengthening the EC's external frontiers. Mr Bangemann, who has just completed a report on progress towards the single market, painted a rosy picture yesterday. Some 90 per cent of the proposals originally set out in 1985 had been adopted by the 12 partners.</p>

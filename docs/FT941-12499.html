			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / The Long View: When debt lingers on Is the American locomotive at last picking up speed and beginning to pull the stagnant global economy out of the sidings? Yesterday's preliminary estimate of US gross national product growth of 5.9 per cent in the October-December quarter gives hope to the optimists. But there is a long way to go. To start with, the Americans present their statistics in their very own special way. Although it seems to have been a good quarter, the year-on-year growth rate was only 2.9 per cent. And with tax increases on the way, the underlying pace of advance is not really very exciting. Moreover, it has been achieved with the help of very lax monetary policy, which surely will have to be tightened soon. In the UK, there is a fair degree of business optimism, judging by the latest survey from the Confederation of British Industry which indicated that prospects in manufacturing were the best in 4 1/2 years. The reported latest 2 per cent economic growth rate is probably an under-estimate. But the extraordinary renewed fuss over the tax increases imposed in last year's two Budgets - to which people have apparently woken up on receiving their new income tax codings - is a reminder of the fragility of confidence. Politicians can juggle their spending and taxing policies but, in the end, they cannot square a circle. Just look at how Japan, the epitome of successful economic manipulation since the 1960s, has slumped into political chaos. The indebtedness generated in the bubble economy of the 1980s continues to threaten financial collapse and, under the strain of the adjustment, the country's renowned political and industrial consensus ('Japan Inc') has fallen apart. In the end, economics imposes its own solutions. For British investors, this week's publication of Barclays de Zoete Wedd's hardy annual, the Equity-Gilt Study, may stimulate some thoughts on the eternal triangular battle between economic growth, inflation and interest rates. Since 1918, the real return on UK equities has been 8 per cent a year on average, beating the long-dated gilt-edged return by 6 percentage points. No contest: history thus tells us that the outperformance by gilts over the past four years, by 4 per cent a year, has been just a blip. But, although history cannot lie, it may speak with a forked tongue. Between the wars, gilts offered strong real returns. The problems developed later because of the chronic high inflation (unmatched by bond yields) in the post-second world war decades up to and including the 1970s. Experience in the two periods was quite different. So, if the climate of the 1930s was to return, might gilt-edged investors reap their reward? True, in the 1930s, equities provided a still higher real return than did gilts. The key to the inter-war years, however, was deflation - an average annual fall in prices of 2 per cent. That is surely not going to happen again, because governments have abandoned the gold peg for their currencies and have generally established targets for the minimum as well as the maximum annual growth rate of the money supply. The banking collapses of the early 1930s that led to severe monetary contraction in the US are not going to be allowed to recur. Instead, central banks in the advanced economies are pumping out liquidity on a vast scale. In the past year, the narrowly-defined US money supply has expanded by more than 10 per cent (although the broader measures, which include savings deposits, have been depleted by large shifts into mutual funds and other theoretically long-term assets). In present conditions, the easy credit strategy is pushing up the prices of financial assets rather than of goods and services. But the potential is there for more general inflation and there will not, at any rate, be the falls in prices (except possibly in Japan) that once persuaded holders of Consols in the UK that yields of 3 or 4 per cent were acceptable; in the 19th century, prices were as likely to fall as rise. Will the strategy of bailing out busted banks really achieve its object, though? No one wants to endure the financial chaos that arises from massive defaults, but the positive side of such collapses in the past - for instance, in the US in the early 1930s - was that they destroyed debt and thus de-geared the national balance sheet, an essential precondition for an eventual recovery. Nowadays, the old debt lives on: household borrowing in the UK remains at very close to record levels (more than 100 per cent of personal disposable income, twice as high as in the early 1980s). For the moment, a fall in the saving ratio is fuelling a rise in consumption, but high indebtedness and slow income growth indicate that those looking for sustained rapid growth in consumer demand will be disappointed. If the UK economic growth rate sinks back later this year to, say, 1.5 per cent, the government will be forced to recognise that only more overtly inflationary policies - of cutting interest rates, encouraging a decline in the sterling exchange rate, and tolerating a rapid growth of the money supply - will restore expansion at a rate fast enough for the Treasury's tax-gathering projections to be met. The implicit choice of fast inflation to destroy debt was, of course, the UK's escape route from the mid-1970s' debt crisis. The key indicator here is the ratio between the long gilt yield and the equity yield, now 2.0. Between the wars, according to the BZW study, this yield ratio was on average 0.8, reflecting not only the absence of inflation but also poor expectations of economic growth. Since 1945, however, the average has risen sharply to about 1.7, and the ratio has shown surprisingly little tendency to decline over the past couple of years. By implication, although investors have reduced their expectations of the rate of inflation, they still believe it will persist over the very long term. And in the US, too, the economic locomotive is absorbing an awful lot of monetary fuel.</p>

			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HERSHISER'S DEMANDS TURN THESE FANS OFF  </P> <P> I've lost all respect for the uppity Mr. Hershiser. His demand for a salary of  more than $2 million a year for three years is bad enough, but he also wants  the Dodgers to promise to pay him if a labor dispute suspends play during the  1990 season.  </P> <P> The Dodgers or some other club will give him what he demands, and he will be  counting his blessings while laughing all the way to the bank.  </P> <P> CARLA ROMERO  </P> <P> Newhall  </P></p>

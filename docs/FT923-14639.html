			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coal prices continue downwards WORLD COAL prices are continuing to fall steadily as the return of South Africa to the market adds to existing oversupply. South African coal is now selling at about Dollars 26 a tonne and can be delivered to Europe at less than Dollars 32 a tonne. Only a few months ago many European buyers made contracts for coal at this level, free on board at South Africa's Richards Bay terminal. South Africa's return to markets in France, Denmark and the US is only part of the problem in the severely over-supplied market. In addition to millions of tonnes of uncontracted South African coal looking for buyers, the former Soviet Union has been pushing coal through export terminals in the Baltic and the Black Sea. Some traders have been forced to ship coal from these ports because of congestion, even though no buyers have been found. As a result Russian coal can be delivered into the UK for Dollars 37 a tonne, compared with Dollars 45 at the start of this year. If anything, the situation is likely to worsen with the rapid expansion of Indonesian exports now beginning to get into its stride and, from next month, the start of big ship (Capesize) loading at a second Colombian port in Santa Marta from one of Colombia's private coal exporters, Prodeco. The international market for steam coal is continuing to expand rapidly  - a path it has been on since the mid-1970s. Last year, when 195.3m tonnes was traded, over I5m tonnes was added to export volumes. By the end of this decade this is expected to have risen to well in excess of 320m tonnes. The trouble is that new mine development and, perhaps more importantly, expansion of output, at existing mines through better equipment and more flexible work practices, have proved more than a match for the pace of expanding demand. The great brake on excess production in years gone by has been strikes, with major disruptions in Australia, Poland and the US having kept price collapses at bay. Years of industrial peace, have banished this to the past. It is a reflection of the inability of the industry to keep itself in balance that reports of a likely major strike in the US early next year is being treated as the solitary ray of hope. Such hope may prove unfounded, however. A major shut-out at one of Canada's major coking coal pits (Westar), coupled with a strike at another (Fording), combined with a roof-fall halting production at New South Wales' Kembla Coal and Coke, have failed to lift coking coal prices as much as 1 cent.</p>

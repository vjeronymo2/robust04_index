			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW BUCHAREST LEADERS WARN HOLDOUT SNIPERS;  </P> <P> ROMANIA: SURRENDER BY TONIGHT OR FACE FIRING SQUADS, OFFICIALS SAY. BUT MAJOR  CITIES ARE MOSTLY QUIET.  </P> <P> The provisional government of Romania on Wednesday warned secret- police  snipers still holding out in Romanian cities to surrender by nightfall today or  face death by firing squad if they are captured.  </P> <P> But after five days of skirmishes between the army and bands of secret police  left over from the regime of executed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, Bucharest and  other major cities were mostly quiet. There has been only sporadic shooting  after the Christmas Day execution of Ceausescu and his wife, Elena.  </P> <P> Also on Wednesday, the new government revoked many of the most repressive laws  and decrees of Ceausescu's regime, including a massive rural resettlement  program widely criticized by international human rights organizations.  </P> <P> The new government moved to dismantle the chief weapons that Ceausescu used to  support his regime -- the Interior Ministry and its state security police.  Provisional President Ion Iliescu transferred the State Security Department,  including the remnants of the dreaded Securitate secret police units, from the  Interior Ministry to the Defense Ministry.  </P> <P> From the early stages of the Romanian uprising against Ceausescu in Bucharest  last week, the Defense Ministry, represented by the armed forces, has been  loyal to the National Salvation Front government. State newspapers, recently  reborn under new logos to disaffiliate them from the Ceausescu regime, brimmed  with praise for the soldiers.  </P> <P> "The Army by the People's Side, the People by the Army's Side," headlined the  Communist Party paper, renamed from The Spark to The Truth.  </P> <P> The Interior Ministry, under Ceausescu the most powerful institution in  Romania, was left with only the police inspector's office, fire brigades and  prisons under its control.  </P> <P> Securitate agents still at large face trial when they surrender but have been  promised leniency if they comply with the government's deadline. If they do not  surrender, however, the government has warned that "extraordinary tribunals"  would employ "emergency measures" and immediate judgment against those who  continue to resist -- a clear indication that firing squads will be employed.  </P> <P> (Early today, Western diplomats said that some of the secret policemen began  heeding the ultimatum and were giving up their weapons to the authorities,  Reuters news agency reported.)  </P> <P> With organized fighting in the country mostly over, the new regime has moved  quickly to consolidate public support, acting first to repeal some of  Ceausescu's most hated policies.  </P> <P> They ranged from a law requiring Romanian citizens in schools, colleges and  public meetings to address each other as tovaras, the borrowed Russian word  meaning "comrade," to a statute on urban and rural planning that led to  systematic destruction of entire towns and the forced settlement of hundreds of  thousands of Romanians.  </P> <P> Program Condemned  </P> <P> Romanian minority communities, mainly Hungarians living in Transylvania and  Germans living in the north, had accused Ceausescu of using the resettlement  program to break up ethnic communities. The program had been condemned by  international human rights organizations.  </P> <P> These same minority organizations were quick to assert themselves under the new  government.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Hungarian activists formed the Hungarian Democratic Union of  Romania, which set goals of creating a government ministry for minorities;  expanding the number of schools teaching in regional ethnic tongues, and  officially recognizing the right to use these languages in public. While not  officially illegal under Ceausescu, using Hungarian or German often resulted in  the arrest of the speakers as foreign agents.  </P> <P> Other laws and decrees revoked by the new government included:  </P> <P> * Laws banning private ownership of copiers and computer printers and requiring  all owners of typewriters to provide the security police with a two-page typing  sample each year that would allow identification of individual type faces.  </P> <P> * The ban on abortion and related laws forbidding the sale of all  contraceptives, part of Ceausescu's plan to increase the number of his subjects  from the current 23 million to 30 million by the end of the century.  </P> <P> *The 1976 law that declared Bucharest and 21 other major Romanian cities and  towns "closed cities" into which people could not move without official  permission.  </P> <P> * The bizarre 1984 resolution of the National Assembly regulating "scientific  nourishment" of the population. Under this law, used by Ceausescu as an excuse  for food shortages in the population, calorie limits were assigned to citizens  based on their jobs. A miner, for example, was allotted 6,000 calories a day, a  journalist or a clerk only 2,000. In defense of this law, widely ridiculed  outside Romania, Ceausescu several times criticized his own people for  overeating and hoarding food.  </P> <P> In fact, one of the key ways the new government appears to be attempting to win  the support of the people here is by making more food instantly available on  the Romanian market.  </P> <P> Program Condemned  </P> <P> Suddenly this week, items not seen in years here in the empty shops, such as  coffee and oranges, have made their way to the shelves.  </P> <P> "We had fresh coffee in our office for the first time in four years," an  official with the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.  </P> <P> Authorities took several other measures to ease the grimness of life here,  playing Christmas carols in the city's subway system and, for the first time,  picking up rock music videos from European stations.  </P> <P> First among the new videos was Tina Turner, singing "We Don't Need Another  Hero." At the University subway stop, an English version of "O Little Town of  Bethlehem" blared from speakers as citizen anti-terrorist patrols frisked  passengers.  </P> <P> Outside food stores, residents of the capital spilled into the streets,  standing in long lines to buy fruit, meat and other foodstuffs. Under  Ceausescu, imports of such products were strictly limited under a severe  austerity program aimed at building hard-currency reserves and, many Romanians  believe, at grinding down the population so that people would not have the  energy or spirit to revolt.  </P> <P> Between 1981 and this year, Ceausescu managed to pay off Romania's entire  $10-billion foreign debt through his austerity program, exporting the richest  food products from the fertile Danube valley.  </P> <P> The program caused such bitterness here that one of the most popular wall  posters during the uprising said "Ceausescu Is a Pig, Packed for Export."  </P> <P> Apartment dwellers also reported that heat in the huge, prefabricated complexes  built in the Ceausescu period had been raised from 59 degrees to 68 degrees  Fahrenheit. A limit on household heating was another fuel-saving program  instituted under the dictator that caused great hardship to elderly residents.  </P> <P> Course Unclear  </P> <P> But while the new leaders appeared set to dismantle Ceausescuism, it is far  less clear how far they will go toward ending communism.  </P> <P> In sharp contrast to the new leadership elsewhere in Eastern Europe, the new  government has said little about the introduction of a market economy, an end  to state planning or recognition of private property rights.  </P> <P> In a televised speech discussing the new government's plans, for example,  Iliescu said only that he hoped to free the economy from "excessive  centralism."  </P> <P> Similarly, in the political sphere, the government has promised free elections  will be held in April, but little has yet been said about laws that would  create the environment needed for truly democratic elections -- assurances of a  right to free association and free press, for example, or guaranteed access by  opposition groups to state television.  </P> <P> U.S. AID ON WAY:The Bush Administration is sending medical supplies. A19  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE ROMANIA STORY  </P> <P> The Government  </P> <P> The provisional government warned secret-police snipers still holding out in  Romanian cities to surrender by nightfall today or face death by firing squad  if they are captured.  </P> <P> The new government also revoked many of the most repressive laws and decrees of  Ceausescu's regime, including a massive rural resettlement program widely  criticized by international human rights organizations.  </P> <P> U.S. Policy  </P> <P> The Bush Administration is sending $750,000 in medical supplies and other  assistance to Romania, the White House announced. President Bush says he is  "amazed and respectful" of the changes that have taken place in Romania.  </P> <P> China's Reaction  </P> <P> Chinese leaders have attacked Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for  undermining socialism in Eastern Europe in an internal document that also tells  Chinese officials what to think and say about the popular uprising in Romania.  </P></p>

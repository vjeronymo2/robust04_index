			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / People: Rapid Path for Donovan Ever flown in or out of New York and cursed the lack of any rapid transit link between the city and its airports, asks Richard Tomkins. Then meet someone who hopes to help put that right - Kathleen Donovan, the first woman to chair the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The Port Authority is an odd institution. Apart from running the three main airports - JFK, La Guardia and Newark - it operates the PATH rapid transit system linking New Jersey and Manhattan, six interstate toll bridges and tunnels, two bus terminals, a ferry service, the New York-New Jersey port, three industrial parks and the World Trade Centre. It has annual revenues of nearly Dollars 2bn, but as a self-governing public agency it is accountable to neither electors nor shareholders. Could things change under Donovan? An attorney, an active Republican and a former New Jersey legislator, she was appointed to the board by New Jersey's Republican governor, Christine Todd Whitman, for whom she campaigned in last year's state elections. Given that context, you might think a touch of privatisation could be on its way. Donovan, however, is reluctant to be cast in the role of revolutionary. If anything, she seems set to expand the authority's business empire further by pressing ahead with plans for a rapid transit system linking JFK and La Guardia airports with Manhattan. True, that will be expensive, she says: 'But then nearly everything the authority does is expensive.' Still, Donovan, 42, does not rule out a growing role for the private sector. The management of some of the authority's functions could be contracted out even if the ownership does not change, she says. 'I am sure you are going to see a lot more public and private sector partnerships.'</p>

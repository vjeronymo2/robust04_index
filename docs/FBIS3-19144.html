			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] Media statements by Italy's major  political parties and their leaders have largely ignored foreign  policy issues during the campaign for the 27-28 March  parliamentary elections. Exceptions have been the leftist  Progressive Alliance's internal debate on the role of NATO and  comments made by several political figures on the recent UN  action in shooting down four Bosnian Serb military aircraft.  <H5>  PDS's Ochetto Visits NATO </H5>   The only mention of foreign policy in the election platform  presented by the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) on 15  February addressed the subject in general terms only. A summary  of the platform appeared in the Rome daily L'UNITA--the PDS  paper--on 16 February, stating that the aim of the PDS is to  promote supranational integration, reform the United Nations,  ensure equal rights for all ethnic communities, develop a  responsible policy on cooperation, eliminate all protectionism,  and fight international crime. Regarding Europe, the PDS  platform presses for a European seat on the UN Security Council,  increasing the powers of the European Commission, Parliament,  and central bank, and developing a common European policy on  labor, research, training, and taxation.    PDS Secretary Achille Occhetto publicly disagreed with  assertions by his Progressive Alliance coalition partner,  Communist Renewal (RC) Secretary Fausto Bertinotti, that NATO  should be abolished because the Warsaw Pact no longer exists and  that NATO now often violates its strictly defensive role, a  remark reported in the Rome daily IL MESSAGGERO on 24 February.  While visiting NATO headquarters in Brussels on 28 February,  Occhetto said that Italy must remain in NATO. An article by  Marco Panara in Rome's LA REPUBBLICA of 1 March reported  Occhetto's opinion that while it does not make sense for Italy  to leave NATO, NATO's role must be redefined. "NATO must now be  equipped to deal with the new and different challenges that  present themselves to peace," Occhetto said. Panara wrote that  the PDS envisages NATO maintaining close cooperation with other  international organizations, especially the UN. In discussing  his meeting at NATO headquarters, Occhetto said that granting  representation to major regional areas to prevent the poorer  countries from feeling neglected was discussed, and added that  the PDS's intent to "impart a dynamic approach to NATO's role"  was welcomed by NATO Secretary General Manf red Woerner.    On the Balkans, Occhetto said he had no doubt that "we must  intervene in Bosnia and the international community must take up  an active position" (LA REPUBBLICA, 10 February). At the NATO  headquarters meeting, Occhetto defended the shooting down of the  four Bosnian Serb military aircraft, as reported in the RAI Due  Television Network on 28 February.  <H5>  RC Against NATO, Intervention in Bosnia </H5>   As reported by correspondent Maurizio Caprara in the Milan  daily CORRIERE DELLA SERA on 24 January, two anti-NATO motions  were filed at the RC congress held in late January. The first  motion requested that Italy leave NATO and the second requested  "fighting against NATO." According to another Caprara article  in CORRIERE DELLA SEFA of 24 February, in presenting RC's  political platform, party leader Armando Cossuta reaffirmed the  demand for eliminating NATO. Caprara emphasized that Cossuta  called for "elimination" of--rather than an "exit" from--NATO.    According to an article in LA REPUBBLICA of 1O February, RC  has taken a stand against foreign armed intervention in Bosnia.  As reported in LA REPUBBLICA of 1 March, the party harshly  condemned the downing of the four Bosnian Serb aircraft. RC  officials asserted that the action may adversely affect the  fragile truce in the area. They added that NATO seemed to be  looking for a pretext to address the Bosnia problem by military  rather than diplomatic means.  <H5>  Northern League Ignores Foreign Issues </H5>   The Northern League has not focused on foreign policy  issues.  A 27 February Rome ANSAMAIL Database version of the League's  platform totally ignored the subject. A rare monitored  reference to a foreign issue appeared in LA REPUBBLICA of 1  March, stating that the League welcomed the news of the NATO  downing of the four Bosnian Serb aircraft. The League statement  called the action a positive fact and added that NATO's role in  Bosnia is confirming how essential NATO is for European security.  <H5>  Forza Italia Supports Military Force in Bosnia </H5>   ANSAMAIL reported on 28 February that Forza Italia's  political platform states: "We want an Italy that is once again  a prime mover in the history of Europe, playing an active role  in the process of European unification, no longer basing its  foreign policy on improvisation but on the correct definition of  its national interests." On the Balkans, LA REPUBBLICA of 1O  February reported a comment by Forza Italia leader Silvio  Berlusconi to the effect that peacemaking actions in Bosnia must  be backed by military force and that "Italy must support, within  the European Community, the `line of determination,' making  available its prestige and its military bases."  <H5>  National Alliance `Cannot Abide' U.S. </H5>   The National Alliance (AN) "cannot abide the Americans,"  wrote LA REPUBBLICA correspondent Antonello Caporale on 1 March.  The Alliance dreams of a Greater Europe, with East and West  finally united and with "no subjugation" to the United States.  According to Caporale, AN believes in European autonomy in  political and military decisionmaking and espouses a broad-based  alliance with South America, with Italy and Spain "as its  vanguard of special influence." AN also wants a "30-year  European plan for Africa, which would act as a European pillar  in competing with the United States and the Far East," Caporale  reports.    According to Caporale, the AN has called for an unspecified  "revision" of the Maastricht Treaty; for Istria, Rijeka, and  Dalmatia to be returned to Italy "by means of international  treaty"; and for Europe to have a seat on the UN Security  Council. In an interview in the Milan daily IL GIORNALE of 31  January, AN ideologue Pino Rauti said he "criticizes Americanism  and mercantilism."  <H5>  Italian Liberal Party Calls for Renegotating Maastricht </H5>   In an opening statement at the Italian Liberal Party (PLI)  congress in early February, PLI member and Transport Minister  Raffaele Costa has suggested the need for renegotiation of the  Maastricht Treaty, and in an interview given to IL GIORNALE on 4  February, Costa said he will challenge the European Union (EU)  over its "bureaucratic and welfarist approach" and will demand  that the treaty be "renegotiated and its implementation  reviewed."  <H5>  Pact for Italy Embraces `Western Ideals' </H5>   The only monitored mention of interest in foreign policy  issues by the Pact for Italy appeared in a 2 March CORRIERE  DELLA SERA article, which briefly reviewed the Pact's program.  According to this article, the program called for a foreign  policy that "espouses the Western ideals of freedom and  democracy with a view to countering the resurgent specter of  ethnic, racial, and religious hatred."  <H5>  Commentary Notes Lack of Interest in Foreign Affairs </H5>   The lack of a foreign policy in the political platform of  most Italian parties was commented on by Franco Venturini in  CORRIERE DELLA SERA of 15 February. Venturini wrote that Italy  "must learn to create its own foreign policy based on internal  [Italian] consensus," which means the country's foreign policy  will be different depending on whether the Right or the Left  wins in the parliamentary elections. Venturini saw truly  "revanchist" feelings concealed in AN leader Gianfranco Fini's  attitude toward Istria and Dalmatia, and anti-Western resentment  lurking in the fringe groups of the extreme right. On the left,  the PDS is allied with RC, which applauds Fidel Castro,  Venturini wrote. In the center, silence reigns and an  "antihistorical temptation to remain collusively passive is  still felt."    Venturini concluded his commentary with some dark humor. He  reported Foreign Minister Andreatta's quip that Berlusconi  rhymes with Zhirinovskiy, that the Italian Republican Party  organ VOCE REPUBBLICANA had compared Fini with Nazi German  official Von Ribbentrop, and that Italian Popular Party member  Rocco Buttiglione had charged Northern League leader Umberto  Bossi with being a new fuehrer. With this evidence in hand,  Venturini wondered why anyone would still believe that Italy's  electoral campaign is neglecting the outside world.</p>

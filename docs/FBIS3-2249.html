			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by So Lai-fun in Shenzhen and Linda Choy] </F>   [Text] China would not meddle in the administration of  Hong Kong after 1997 and would immediately put to a stop to any  interference that was occurring now, the Chinese leader in  charge of Hong Kong affairs promised yesterday. "Some district  officials and even high-up central government officials have  been sticking their hands into Hong Kong," Lu Ping, the Director  of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, said in Shenzhen.  "No department or district will be permitted to meddle in or  interfere with Hong Kong's business or affairs," he told an  approving audience of rotarians at a club luncheon.    "The prevention of this sort of thing happening starts now."  He said Hong Kong people could expect to see officers of the  People's Liberation Army in the territory but he pledged that  Beijing would not station members of the People's Armed Police  in the territory.    China would adhere to the principle of "one country, two  systems" and the provisions of the Sino-British Joint  Declaration and Basic Law to maintain the status quo after the  change of sovereignty. He said Hong Kong should remain a  business centre and should serve as a "golden bridge" between  the two different economies. It should never be turned into a  "political bridge" through which someone could penetrate and  alter the mainland's socialist system.    "Anybody who wanted to transform the two systems into one  was  only daydreaming," he said. "Hong Kong people should prevent  this golden bridge from breaking down.    "And the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office would bear the  responsibility of promoting the Basic Law on the mainland so  that all departments observe the Basic Law in dealing with  matters relating to Hong Kong."    Mr Lu conceded during his 40-minute speech that some  mainland  officials had expressed views that were contrary to the Basic  Law and this was a problem raised by some Hong Kong affairs  advisers earlier in the week. But he reiterated the importance  of the principle of Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong and said  the formation of the Preliminary Working Committee had provided  the starting point in this direction. More Hong Kong people  could take part in preparatory work for the Special  Administrative Region (SAR) government and it would lead to a  solid foundation for the future administration, he said.    His remarks were made just hours before China launched  another advisory body in Hong Kong, incorporating 274 community  leaders from a wide political spectrum into a group to be called  district affairs advisers. There were some small "l" liberals  among the appointees, but there were still no members associated  with the United Democrats [UDHK], a group labelled by mainland  officials as "subversive".    The third tier of advisers, after the Hong Kong Affairs  Advisers and the Preliminary Working Committee, taps the Hong  Kong Government's existing system of advice and representation.  There are 20 municipal councillors, one legislator and 108  district board members -- 12 of them being board chairmen.  Other are kaifong association representatives, academics and  businessmen.    In an apparent bid to address criticism that China was  unwilling to hear sharply dissenting views, the new list of  advisers includes a few moderate democrats. Meeting Point has  been given two seats, while the Association for Democracy and  People's Livelihood (ADPL) got four. The pro-China Democratic  Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong will provide 43  advisers.    Speaking at the launching ceremony at the China Resources  Building in Wanchai, XINHUA (the New China News Agency) director  Zhou Nan asked the advisers to make use of their "wisdom and  their influence" in society to work for a smooth transition.  Although there were people who tried to create obstacles to the  return of Hong Kong to its motherland, the Chinese people would  not bow to it, Mr Zhou said. "We will stand firm together with  the patriots in the recovery of Hong Kong's sovereignty,  following the (principles of) `one country two systems' and  `Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong people' set out in the Basic  Law," he said.    In a brief outline of the advisers' duties, Mr Zhou said  they  should be able to reflect the views of the Hong Kong people and  promote the Basic Law, the mini-constitution for the SAR. Mr  Zhou also called on the advisers to encourage the public to  participate in all sorts of social affairs, but he did not go  into detail. They should also offer their opinions and  suggestions on important issues related to the sovereignty  changeover, he said.    Mr Zhou did not say whether advisers would be consulted on  district affairs, their area of expertise. Quoting the words of  the paramount Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, Mr Zhou said it was  important for "those who love China and Hong Kong to participate  actively in all sorts of social and political affairs of Hong  Kong."    UDHK vice-chairman Yeung Sum yesterday criticised the new  body as merely a "united front tactic" by the Chinese Government  to isolate the party. Mr Yeung said he was not surprised nor  disappointed to find all party members excluded from the new  organisation. "We are not their target for a united front  because some of our members supported the pro-democracy movement  in 1989," he said. "But the Chinese side should think about  whether they should isolate us in the long run if they really  want to listen to the voice of people in Hong Kong."    But appointee ADPL vice-chairman Leung Kwong-cheong,  defended  the role of the advisers, saying that it was important to  strengthen communication with China. Asked if this could split  the territory's pro-democracy camp, Mr Leung said: "No one  could split us but ourselves. It is important that other  pro-democracy groups do not criticise us (for becoming advisers)  all the time.    "If they noticed anything wrong with our performance, say we  did not convey a certain kind of opinion, they are welcome to  give us constructive advice," he said.</p>

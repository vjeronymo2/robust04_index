			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] Let's try again to get through by phone  to our reporter Ernest Zorzun in Belchatow:    [Zorzun] I am speaking from Belchatow, bringing the latest  news. Solidarity has called a nationwide general strike for 28  April. The national protest action staff have stated that this  action is being taken after today's talks with the industry  minister and the fruitless wait for the government to implement  the trade union's demands. The action will be continuous strike  action and is aimed at putting pressure on the government in  order to force it to quickly present a timetable for  implementing the demands of the national trade unions. Minister  Pol was urged (?to do this) during this morning's talks, Marian  Krzaklewski stated. We have no other way, Krzaklewski added, at  the end of a hastily organized news conference.    [Announcer] Thank you. I remind you that the government is  meeting just now to discuss the strike situation.</p>

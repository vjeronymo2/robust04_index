			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Two top palm oil growers expecting bumper crops MALAYSIA and Indonesia, the world's top two palm oil growers, are heading for bumper crops this year because of rising yields, officials and analysts say, reports Reuter from Kuala Lumpur. But traders and refiners warn the production surge could put downward pressure on prices later in the year. Seasonal supply tightness is keeping prices steady at present. 'With the supply push, I guess in the next six months prices will ease somewhat but not a real washout,' says Mr Jim Sutter, managing director of Kupak, a local refiner. The May contract on the local crude palm oil futures market is hovering at R867 (Pounds 190) a tonne, up from R846 a year ago, aided by low stocks and supply tightness. Traders say Indonesian domestic demand for palm oil is high and exporters have had to defer sales of 15,000 tonnes originally scheduled for shipment from January to March. The shortage results from higher exports of Indonesian coconut oil and palm kernel oil and a drought expected to cause a lower-than-anticipated rise in palm oil production. Analysts expect production in Malaysia and Indonesia to recover sharply from July to post a bumper crop. Meanwhile, Indonesia is buying about 120,000 tonnes of Malaysian palm olein between January and March to meet the shortfall, Mr Sutter says. 'Malaysian production looks very good this year due to higher rainfalls and better farm inputs (because of) recent high prices,' explains Mr ST Keoh, managing director of Malaysia's Guan Soon Heng Futures Trading. Malaysia's Palm Oil Research Institute has put Malaysia's 1992 output at a record 6.3m tonnes, up from 6.14m in 1991, but some analysts say it could reach 6.5m tonnes. Indonesian output is expected to rise to 3m tonnes in 1991-92 (April-March) from about 2.4m in 1990-91.</p>

			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CORONA DEL MAR;  </P> <P> IDENTITY SOUGHT FOR MAY MURDER VICTIM  </P> <P> The Orange County coroner's office has released a sketch of a woman found dead  in May along Coast Highway at Crystal Cove State Beach, south of Corona del  Mar, in hopes of learning her identity.  </P> <P> An autopsy determined that the 5-foot, 2-inch woman was strangled. When her  body was found about 6 a.m. on May 14, the woman was wearing a white tank top  and short red skirt with white tennis shoes, size 7. She was 25 to 35 years old  with blond hair and hazel eyes. Her ears were pierced and she was missing four  upper front teeth.  </P> <P> Investigators believe that the woman was killed elsewhere and her body was  dumped alongside the highway, making it unlikely that she was a local resident.  They requested that anyone who might know the identity of the woman contact the  coroner's office at (714) 647-7000.  </P></p>

No comments were received on the proposal. This order approves the proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Description of the Proposal <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of CBOE's proposed rule change is twofold: first, to clarify Rule 6.42 and add a new Interpretation and Policy, .02 to permit quotes for combined trades and stock-option orders, as defined by CBOE Rule 1.1(ii) (``stock-option orders'') to be expressed in any fractional or decimal price; <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  and, second, to alter the priority principles applicable to combined trades and stock-option combination orders, as defined by CBOE Rule 1.1(ii)(b) (``stock-option combinations''), when priced net at a multiple of one sixteenth of a dollar. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  The CBOE believes that these changes will facilitate the orderly execution of combined trades and stock-option orders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Amendment No. 2. Under Rule 1.1(ii)(b), a stock-option combination order is an order to buy or sell a stated number of units of an underlying or a related security coupled with the purchase and sale of an equal number of put and call option contracts, each having the same exercise price, expiration date and number of units of the underlying or related security, on the opposite side of the market representing in aggregate twice the number of units of the underlying or related security. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 6.42 currently permits a CBOE member holding an order on a combined trade or stock-option combination to attain priority over bids and offers in the trading crowd (``crowd'') and the customer limit order book (``limit order book'' or ``book'') provided all legs of the combined trade or stock-option combination trade at a price that is at least equivalent to quotes in the crowd or on the book. As revised, combined trades and stock-option combinations priced net at a multiple of 1/16 will attain priority over orders in the book only if one leg of the transaction trades at a price that is better than the corresponding bid or offer in the book while the remaining legs of the transaction are at least equivalent to the established bids or offers in the crowd or book. The principles for attaining priority over the crowd remain unchanged. Bids or offers that are part of a combined trade or stock-option combination which is not priced at a net multiple of 1/16, while permissible, will not be entitled to priority under the exception contained in paragraph (d) to Rule 6.45. Finally, only the net price of the combination will be quoted in fractional or decimal prices; the individual legs of the combination must still be quoted in accordance with Rule 6.42. <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Letter from Barbara Casey, Vice President, Department of Market Regulation, CBOE, to Michael Walinskas, Derivative Products Regulation, SEC, dated August 24, 1994 (``August 24, 1994 Letter''). Rule 6.42 requires bids and offers for all option series trading above $3 to be expressed in 1/8ths of $1, while bids and offers for all option series trading below $3 are to be expressed in 1/16ths of $1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As an illustration, assume that Option A is quoted at 5 bid, 51/8 asked, and option B is quoted at 6 bid, 61/8 asked, and assume that all four quotes are represented in the book. In that instance, a spread involving the purchase (or sale) of option A and the sale (or purchase) of option B may trade at a net credit or debit of 1 (e.g., a net credit of 1 if option A is bought at 5 and option B sold at 6, or a net debit of 1 if option A is sold at 51/8 and option B is bought at 61/8. In this example, because the net price is a multiple of 1/16 and the execution of the spread involves taking the same side of the market as the book on only one side of the spread, the spread would receive priority even though it ``touches'' quotes in the book on both sides. (That is, in the spread consisting of the purchase of option A at 5 and the sale of option B at 6, only the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> purchase <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of option A occurs at the same price and on the same side of the market as the book, which is bid at 5; the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> sale <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of option B at 6 is on the opposite side of the market in the book, which is  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> bid <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at 6.) In the same example, it would not be permissible under Rule 6.45(d) to trade the spread at a net debit of 7/8 by selling the first option at 51/8 and buying the second at 6, because this trade would be executed at the same price and on the same side of the market as the book on  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> both sides <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of the spread. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

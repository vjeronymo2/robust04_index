			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Observer: Added chunk Meanwhile French state-owned car-maker Renault is beefing up its image with a heavier look to its logo. From now on, the Renault lozenge will be in three dimensions, rather than two, and be given a thick chunky appearance, which the group trusts will convey an 'ideal of quality, efficiency and value.' The changed badge will make its first appearance with the launch of the company's new executive model, the Safrane, and all offices and showrooms will adopt the reshaped emblem in due time. Why all the bother? The aim is to show the 'change of soul and image of the company,' says its chairman Raymond Levy in an internal memo. It could also be something to do with Renault's 1990 alliance with Volvo, Sweden's maker of chunky family cars. The pair have always denied planning a common car. But it seems, at least, that the French partner is bringing its image more in line with its Swedish friend's solidity.</p>

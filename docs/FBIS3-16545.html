The Military Are Concerned by the Economy, Not by  Politics"]    [Excerpt] None of the journalists who came yesterday to  the defense minister's press conference knew for sure what had  prompted the event. Representatives of the mass media asked  Pavel Grachev lots of questions concerning the problems of the  Armed Forces that they were interested in before the purpose of  the press conference was clarified. Mr. Grachev denied rumors  that the Army had been put on alert and that some of his actions  were allegedly politically motivated.    In the view of many observers, one of the reasons for the  rumors was the postponement of Pavel Grachev's announced visit  to the Leningrad Military District. Some time ago the defense  minister said that he would stay in Moscow as long as the  president and the General Staff chief are away from the capital  in order to exercise day-to-day command and control of the  strategic nuclear forces. In the press conference, Pavel  Grachev flatly denied any political bottom line of this  decision, saying only that such is normal practice and that one  of the three must always remain in Moscow. Today, when General  Staff Chief Mikhail Kolesnikov is returning from France, the  defense minister will leave for Kaliningrad.    Pavel Grachev also denied rumors that there are units in the  Moscow Military District that had been put on alert. He  reaffirmed that the Army does not interfere in the political  struggle and it is not going to do so, but that it will act  decisively if it senses the threat of civil war. [passage  omitted]</p>

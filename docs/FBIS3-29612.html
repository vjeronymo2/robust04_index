Hideaki Kumano, vice minister of international trade and  industry, said the table will be submitted Monday despite a U.S.  move to withdraw some of its trade concessions.    "We will not go back on the content (of tariff cut offers)  as  of last December," Kumano told reporters.    Kumano's comment came against the backdrop of reports  quoting  U.S. trade negotiator John Schmidt as saying Washington was  withdrawing some tariff offers, including cuts on industrial  electronics products.    Japan's ambassador to GATT Nobutoshi Akao accused the United  States last week of "betrayal" in pulling back tariff cut offers  that helped pave the way for the Uruguay Round trade pact.    U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor has denied the  accusation but Akao says Washington has advised Tokyo that it is  withdrawing lower customs duties on electronics against the  agreement reached in December.</p>

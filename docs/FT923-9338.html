			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Council may have to shed 1,000 jobs LEADERS OF North Tyneside council met union representatives yesterday to discuss a proposed restructuring which may cost up to 1,000 jobs, or 10 per cent of the workforce. The Labour-controlled authority, which has exhausted its reserves, faces a deficit of between Pounds 12m and Pounds 20m next year. The reorganisation is intended to sweep away the departmental structure in favour of service areas and has been triggered by financial problems. The authority, which was rate capped in 1985-86 and charge capped in 1990-91, has already made cuts of Pounds 12m this year. It blames its difficulties on the government's standard spending assessment which, it says, fails to take account of the level of social deprivation in the borough. However, Conservative councillors say central government is not to blame for the problems. The council has relied on drawing on reserves, and reducing employment to balance its books for several years. But with an estimated standard spending assessment of Pounds 134.5m for 1993-94 against projected expenditure of Pounds 154m, it is having to overhaul its entire structure. The plan will be finalised in the autumn and implemented once the level of assessment is known in November. The authority said yesterday that it was too early to say how many jobs would go, and what cuts in services would be made. It said, however, that a 10 per cent reduction would be the 'worst case'. An enhanced voluntary severance scheme, used by the authority in 1990-91 when 600 jobs were cut, was ruled unlawful by the High Court last year. Unions, which represent the majority of employees, are sympathetic but have not ruled out industrial action against compulsory redundancies. Mr Trevor Johnston, secretary of Nalgo, the local government union, said: 'The council have a duty to provide employment as well as to service the area.'</p>

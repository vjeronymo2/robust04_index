			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "deu": "Scharping: Union Campaign Is </F> Disgusting"]    [Text] Hannover/Bonn -- Social Democratic Party of Germany  [SPD] Chairman Rudolf Scharping has announced that he intends to  request all Stasi records about himself to subsequently publish  them together with a description of his experiences. Scharping  thus reacted to accusations from the Union parties that in the  1980's he had advocated the recognition of GDR citizenship in  talks with GDR politicians. The Christian Democratic Union  [CDU] politicians had based their accusations on Stasi files.    Before an SPD Presidium meeting in Hannover Scharping  harshly  criticized the "campaign of the Union." The accusation that SPD  politicians had cooperated too closely with the GDR is  "disgusting and indecent," the SPD chairman said. In particular  the campaign against SPD presidential candidate Johannes Rau is  "so mean that I can only be surprised that the chancellor is  participating in it." Obviously, the chancellor is in deep  trouble; he refuses any discussion about the central topics,  such as work and finances. "When conservatives struggle for  staying in government, then they use almost any means,"  Scharping said. Chancellor Helmut Kohl had accused the Social  Democrats of having betrayed the goal of Germany's reunification  by making concessions to the Socialist Unity Party of Germany  [SED] and had in particular attacked Johannes Rau.    Deputy CDU Chairwoman Angela Merkel meanwhile stated that  she  sees the accusation against Rau that during his candidacy for  the chancellor's office he had intended to offer recognition to  the GDR "refuted" for the time being. Rau stated that what was  meant at that time was respect for the GDR citizenship but not  recognition, Merkel said. "For me this is acceptable for now."    However, for her the suspicion that the SPD cooperated with  the SED for the benefit of help in the election campaign remains  the "very critical point," Merkel stated. "I believe that this  is a point that exceeds a certain limit," the women's affairs  minister, who comes from eastern Germany, said. Rau has not  given sufficient explanations on this issue. Merkel denied that  the CDU wants to use the controversy about the past as  ammunition against the SPD in the election campaign. Her party  only wants "historical clarification."    Merkel and CDU Deputy Rainer Eppelmann, who is chairman of  the Expert Committee on the GDR Past, had sent an open letter to  Rau, asking him about the controversial contacts between the SPD  and the GDR leadership at the end of the 1980's. Rau also  answered with a letter.</p>

			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Industrial action by public-sector workers 'absolutely inevitable Industrial action by Britain's 5.8m public-sector workers against the government's three-year pay freeze is 'absolutely inevitable' from next April, Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU general union, said yesterday, Robert Taylor writes. Announcing his union's part in a prolonged campaign with other unions against the freeze, Mr Morris predicted 'an explosion of anger' in the spring when most public-sector pay bargaining takes place and when tax increases come into force. He was keen to emphasise that the unions would not be launching the kind of damaging conflict seen in 1978-79 which helped destroy the Labour government. Mr Morris said, however, that unions were planning a campaign that could last until 1996. All public-sector unions are deciding whether to back action on April 11. The TGWU's finance and general purposes committee will decide on January 13. There are signs that it will back away from a one-day general strike in the public sector. The executive committee of Unison, the largest public-sector union, has already endorsed action.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Therefore, because Tier 1 capital, or ``core capital,'' is intended to be permanent in nature, the OCC believes the definition of Tier 1 capital should not include these unrealized gains and losses. Such treatment would be inconsistent with the capital measurement and standards provisions of the Basle Accord, an international agreement of the central banks and supervisory authorities of ten countries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Change to Common Stockholders' Equity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In addressing the issues raised by the commenters on the merits of including unrealized gains and losses in regulatory capital, the OCC considered eliminating the requirement to deduct unrealized losses on noncurrent marketable equity securities. However, the OCC believes the use of amortized cost is relevant for debt securities but not for equities. Absent the default of the issuer, a debt security will realize its face amount. However, an equity security does not have a maturity value. Consequently, the market value of an equity security represents the best measure of its worth.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The OCC believes market value is the appropriate method of valuing equities, but does not believe it is appropriate to include unrealized gains in regulatory capital. The OCC and the other Federal agencies have a long-standing policy of excluding all unrealized gains from Tier 1 capital and do not believe it is appropriate to deviate from this policy. Accordingly, the OCC decided to retain the requirement to deduct unrealized losses on equity securities. This final rule clarifies the description of the deduction and revises the definition of common stockholders' equity to reflect the new security classification specified under FAS 115. Accordingly, banks must adjust Tier 1 capital for net unrealized holding losses on equity securities with readily determinable fair values held in the available-for-sale portfolio.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Other Issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> To ensure regulators do not ignore significant unrealized depreciation in the market value of securities when assessing a bank's safety and soundness, examiners will consider both unrealized gains and losses in their evaluation of the adequacy of a bank's regulatory capital. When unrealized losses could threaten a bank's financial condition, other regulatory actions that are based on regulatory capital may be initiated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Examiners will use their discretion to determine if a national bank has taken an investment approach that is inconsistent with the OCC's description of suitable investment practices. If it appears that an institution is artificially manipulating security classifications to increase regulatory capital, examiners may require banks to account for securities at market values instead of amortized cost. The OCC plans to issue additional guidance that will describe how unrealized gains and losses will be considered and what actions examiners will take when they detect gains trading and other unsafe practices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, it is hereby certified that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. This final rule will not increase the number of banks that do not meet regulatory capital standards. The effect on capital will be minimal regardless of bank size.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The OCC has determined that this final rule is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

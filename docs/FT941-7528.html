			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: UK gilts After the turbulence of the last week, the Bank of England must be glad to have got yesterday's gilts auction away successfully. But if the cover of 1.5 times looks respectable, the six basis point difference between the average and the lowest accepted yield leaves room for doubt about the strength of demand. It looks as though cover was boosted by a number of rogue bids submitted on the off chance of picking up paper on the cheap. With overseas demand at a low ebb, it did not help that the Chancellor's panel of independent advisers was lukewarm about further interest rate cuts on Tuesday. That sapped confidence at the short end of the market, while Mr Alan Greenspan's soothing words to Congress have not yet fully calmed sentiment at the longer end of international markets. At some stage, the positive fundamentals should draw buyers out again. After all, inflation is low and at least one more cut in UK rates remains in prospect. Gilts' 70 basis point yield premium over US Treasury issues is a good starting point for a recovery. But it may take a while to make itself felt.</p>

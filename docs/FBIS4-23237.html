			<p>BFN     [Text] The Nigeria Police has warned that any political  program outside those by the Federal Government should be  considered illegal and, therefore, will not be tolerated. In a  statement in Lagos, the police drew attention to the activities  of a group known as the National Democratic Coalition, whose  action and utterances it said were not only illegal but  confrontational and designed to undermine the security of the  government. It pointed out that the government, in its genuine  efforts to turn the country to democratic rule, had set in  motion a program to achieve the goal. The police advised all  genuine advocates of democracy to take advantage of the ongoing  processes for a constitutional conference.</p>

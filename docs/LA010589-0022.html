			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH HAS COMPELLING REASONS TO PURSUE CHEMICAL-WEAPONS PACT  </P> <P> On numerous occasions throughout last year's presidential campaign, Vice  President George Bush promised voters that a treaty banning chemical weapons  would be one of the highest priorities of his Administration.  </P> <P> This intention to work actively on behalf of a chemical-weapons ban has become  a source of concern to arms-control opponents and proponents alike. The former  question the "verifiability" of a chemical-weapons treaty while the latter fear  that it may take precedence over a treaty limiting strategic nuclear arms.  Although it will not be easy to reach final agreement on the terms under which  all chemical weapons can be eliminated, domestic as well as international  realities make it imperative that such a treaty be at the top of the Bush  Administration's arms-control agenda.  </P> <P> The President-elect's personal interest in banning chemical weapons is partly  explained by his own recent involvement with the issue. In April, 1984, Bush  introduced a chemical-weapons treaty draft in Geneva on behalf of the United  States. This is probably one of the few Reagan Administration foreign-policy  efforts that bears the vice president's fingerprints. Bush also cast three  tie-breaking votes in the Senate in favor of the Pentagon's program to produce  new chemical weapons. Because his first vote in support of the so-called  binary-weapons program prompted a disapproving phone call from the vice  president's mother, Dorothy Bush, President Reagan himself agreed to call the  elder Bush to explain her son's second vote. A successful outcome in Geneva  therefore would not only be a personal triumph for the President-elect but  would also vindicate his earlier votes on binary weapons.  </P> <P> Over and above these personal reasons, domestic and international problems  provide other, more compelling, reasons to pursue a ban on chemical weapons.  Here at home, Congress is showing more and more reluctance to continue funding  the binary-weapons program. Doubts about the technical effectiveness of one of  the proposed systems, the Bigeye bomb, as well as more general budgetary  restraints resulted in deep cuts in the binary program in the current fiscal  year.  </P> <P> If, as seems likely, these technical and budgetary concerns remain, Congress  will almost certainly impose further limits on the production of binary  artillery shells, and will refuse to provide additional funds for the  development and procurement of other binary systems. Under these circumstances,  even the most ardent binary enthusiasts are likely to support the elimination  of both American and Soviet chemical-weapons stocks as part of a larger treaty  on chemical disarmament.  </P> <P> Two international developments add further urgency to the efforts to ban  chemical weapons. Under an agreement reached by Reagan and Chancellor Helmut  Kohl in May, 1986, U.S. chemical weapons currently stored in West Germany are  to be removed by 1992. This agreement enjoys widespread support in West  Germany, in part because civilians there would suffer disproportionately if  such weapons were ever used in a Central European war.  </P> <P> However, influential elements in both Congress and the Pentagon believe that  without the U.S. stocks of chemical weapons in West Germany the Atlantic  alliance will be severely weakened in its ability to deter Soviet chemical use.  As the 1992 deadline draws nearer, the United States may be forced to choose  between trying to delay or prevent implementation of the Reagan-Kohl agreement,  thus precipitating a crisis in U.S.-West German relations, and carrying out an  act of unilateral chemical disarmament. Only by agreeing to eliminate all  chemical weapons will the United States be able to avoid this Hobbesian choice.  </P> <P> Finally, and most important, a ban on chemical weapons is essential to halting  their proliferation in the developing world. For many years the only known  members of the chemical club were the United States, the Soviet Union and  France. This situation changed abruptly in 1984, when U.N. investigators  confirmed Iranian claims of Iraqi chemical use in the Persian Gulf war. As many  as a dozen other Third World countries, including Libya, reportedly either  possess chemical weapons or are trying to acquire them. Persuading these  countries to forgo what has often been termed the "poor man's atomic bomb" will  not be easy. Yet without a global chemical-weapons ban the proliferation of  these weapons will almost certainly continue.  </P> <P> U.S. security as well as international security more generally would be well  served by an agreement eliminating chemical weapons on a global scale. Bush  recognizes this simple fact, and has committed himself to achieving this goal.  No one need fear that he will sign a "bad" chemical-weapons treaty. Nor should  there be concern about such a treaty detracting from efforts to reduce  strategic nuclear arms. The real worry is that efforts to achieve a ban on  chemical weapons will be impeded by those who fail to understand the domestic  and international realities that the next President will face.  </P></p>

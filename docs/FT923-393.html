			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / UK retreats over demands for reform of ERM: Qualified apology for criticism of Germany BRITAIN was last night retreating from its demands for an overhaul of the European exchange rate mechanism after a barrage of criticism from its European partners. At a meeting of European finance ministers in Brussels, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, softened earlier charges that 'fault-lines' in the ERM forced sterling and the Italian lira to withdraw from the system. Mr Lamont's retreat headed off the threat of British isolation on the ERM issue. Instead, EC ministers chose to emphasise a new consensus based on the need for early ratification of the Maastricht treaty, without renegotiation, and adherence to the strict economic convergence criteria as a pre-condition for joining a future European economic and monetary union (Emu). In a four-point communique, ministers also stressed their opposition to a two-speed Europe with France and Germany leading a group of core currencies into a monetary union. The aim was for all 12 members to proceed together. Mr Lamont gave a qualified apology for recent criticism of Germany and the Bundesbank in certain sections of the British press, saying he was 'sorry' if it had given offence but 'very frank' exchanges were sometimes needed. He said he did not hold himself responsible for everything said in the British press. The Brussels meeting was billed as an important session to prepare for the emergency European summit called by Mr John Major, UK prime minister, to discuss reform of the ERM and ratification of the Maastricht treaty, following its lukewarm endorsement in the French referendum. But EC finance ministers mounted a fierce defence of the ERM and the European Monetary System as 'a key factor of economic stability and prosperity in Europe'. Mr Lamont, a strong advocate of floating the pound outside the ERM and a critic of the Bundesbank's role in the sterling crisis, said he would now be satisfied 'in large part' if the Birmingham summit confined itself to 'technical' issues. Earlier, the British government had made reform a precondition for sterling's re-entry into the ERM. Mr Lamont also stressed that these 'technical' issues would be part of a 'medium-range' debate on the operation of the ERM. No ERM decisions which would affect the financial markets would be taken at Birmingham. Mr Horst Kohler, state secretary in the German finance ministry, rejected British criticism. 'We are not talking about the failure of the ERM but how the system's rules were not applied.' A senior Luxembourg official, echoing comments by other delegations unsympathetic to Britain, predicted that Birmingham 'would not go down in the monetary history of the EC'. In spite of his bruising encounter in Brussels, Mr Lamont denied that yesterday's meeting left Britain isolated. Other countries shared the UK's concerns about the monetary turbulence of the past fortnight. Mr Michel Sapin, French finance minister damped recent speculation that Paris and Bonn were creating a Franco-German alliance or a mini-Europe. In a gesture to Mr Lamont, Mr Sapin said: 'In no sense has Britain been isolated. Britain is one element and an active element of the consensus shown in this communique.' But Mr Jean-Claude Juncker, the Luxembourg finance minister, said: 'If the British government chooses to wait (on Maastricht) that is their problem, but we won't accept that someone can try to block implementation of the treaty.' Mr Kohler expressed concern to Mr Lamont about recent anti-German sentiment in the British press and remarks attributed to Lord Tebbit about the management of the Bundesbank. Mr Lamont said that some 'harsh' words had been exchanged in recent weeks, and he was sorry if they had offended anybody - but sometimes there had to be 'very frank exchanges of opinion'. He also underscored a commitment to reduce inflation, now that Britain has in effect devalued the pound through its withdrawal from the ERM. He would raise interest rates if necessary in future, he said, stressing Britain's support for the convergence criteria laid down in the Maastricht treaty.

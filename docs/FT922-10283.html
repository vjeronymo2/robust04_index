			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Women's lack of independence linked to low pay THE NUMBER of women achieving full economic independence has not increased significantly in recent years even though more women now go out to work, according to a report published today. Much of the growth in women's paid work has been in part-time, low-paid jobs often chosen to fit in with women's caring responsibilities, the research by the Equal Opportunities Commission finds. 'In addition to this, women are finding that many of the part-time jobs available offer fewer hours than they require and less employment protection,' the commission says. Overall, the percentage of women in employment rose from 58 per cent in 1973 to 68 per cent in 1990. The most marked increase in employment has been among women with pre-school-age children: in 1973 27 per cent went out to work, compared with 45 per cent in 1990. The percentage of women with full-time jobs rose from 34 per cent to 38 per cent over the period, while the percentage working part-time rose from 23 per cent to 29 per cent. Parallel with the increase in part-time working, there has been a trend towards shorter part-time hours and increased casualisation of part-time jobs, the commission reports. Relatively low pay is still the norm for women, the study finds, although there has been some narrowing of the gender pay gap in recent years. Full-time women workers still earn, on average, 78 per cent of the hourly rate earned by male full-timers. Pay is particularly low among part-timers, with the gap between average hourly pay of full-time and part-time workers widening over the past decade. The study says the social security system reinforces inequalities by favouring male employment patterns uninterrupted by breaks for child-rearing. Social security payments often assume the man of the house is the main breadwinner and he will share out the family income. However, says the commission, 'in many households this sharing does not take place and many women who are separated from their husbands actually feel better off because at least they are in control of their own finances'.

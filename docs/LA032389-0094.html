			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> CONTRACT SPURS YOSEMITE RUSH  </P> <P> Tourists flocked to Yosemite National Park after park concession workers  overwhelmingly approved a new labor contract. The ratification vote eliminated  the threat of a strike by hundreds of hotel, recreational, custodial and retail  workers in the park during the usually busy Easter Week. Union members voted  301 to 14 to accept the new, three-year contract with Yosemite Park and Curry  Co. The pact includes a 10.5% wage increase over three years along with  improved health care benefits and improved housing benefits. "Once people heard  there was a tentative agreement, a lot of them decided to come to the park for  Easter," said park spokeswoman Mallory Smith.  </P></p>

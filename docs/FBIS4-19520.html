			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Wilhelm Teuretsbacher: "A Right-wing Extremist </F> Division of Cells"]    [Text] Right-wing extremists are increasingly organizing  themselves into so-called small cells. It is becoming  increasingly international and brutal. The current annual report  by the Interior Ministry, which has become exclusively available  to KURIER, leaves no doubt that the fight against right-wing  extremism will become tougher.    Statistically, the number of right-wing extremist offenses  hardly changed in 1993 as compared with 1992. A total of 525  reports were made, 113 house searches were carried out, and 20  people were arrested. The police activities in connection with  the letter-bomb attacks are not included in these statistics.  The brutalization of the scene shows a shift in the offenses:  There were fewer violations of the laws banning neo-Nazi  activities and the wearing of Nazi insignia, but more offenses  under the Penal Code.    A succession of generations is taking place. "In the  executive committees of associations that cultivate the  traditions and in moderately large organizations, revisionists  and right-wing extremists are increasingly replacing the war  generation," the report stresses. Of the 425 political parties  that are registered with the Interior Ministry, 77 have been  classified as leaning toward the right; nine have been banned.  Several associations are being examined, including the Action  Committee for Politics (AFP), which allegedly maintains close  relations with the Military Sports Group Trenck.    Since the establishment of a separate group at the Vienna  police headquarters for the fight against youth gangs, this  problem is under control. Vorarlberg is an exception, where  more right-wing extremist youth groups exist than in the rest of  the country. One reason is reportedly the large number of  foreigners in the province.    Right-wing extremist agitation at the political level  declined in 1993. However, underground activities have  increased -- above all in the provinces of Carinthia, Upper  Austria, and Styria. So-called purposeful cell activities are  involved there. Efforts to form a collective movement, as  embodied by Gottfried Kuessel, for example, no longer exist.  Joint action is being avoided. The activities by subgroups and  small groups that have now developed are difficult to control by  the police. The terrorists responsible for the letter-bomb  attacks are also believed to belong to such cells.    The Congress of Revisionists has been described as the  international platform. Such congresses took place in 1991  (Munich) and 1992 (Stockholm). It has been proved that links  exist with Germany, the United States, Hungary, Great Britain,  Italy, Norway, Sweden, and France. German skinheads are mainly  active in Vorarlberg, Salzburg, Upper Austria, and Vienna. In  Carinthia, extremists from Spain and Switzerland have been seen.    There is a lively exchange of propaganda material. A  Canadian revisionist disseminates his falsification of history  through radio programs on short wave. In addition, a trade in  computer diskettes that are also mailed to spokesmen at  secondary and high schools is taking place. A modern mailbox  system has also been developed. On one level, the Thule Network,  installed in Germany, disseminates propaganda. On another, it  is being used for communications. Austrian extremists are  considered regular customers.    The executive bodies are also reacting with globalization.  The Bern Club, to which the security services of the European  Union and Austria belong, actions against right-wing extremism  are being coordinated. Other security agreements have also been  concluded.</p>

			<p><P> August 30, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ARTISTS HALT CORCORAN EXHIBITS IN WAKE OF SHOW'S CANCELLATION  </P> <P> A boycott by some artists of the Corcoran Gallery over its cancellation of a  photography exhibit including pictures of genitalia has led to the "indefinite  postponement" of two other scheduled contemporary art exhibits, gallery  officials said today.  </P> <P> The scheduling in June of the exhibit by Robert Mapplethorpe touched off a  political controversy that resulted in Congress moving to restrict federal  subsidies for artists.  </P> <P> The gallery said today that contemporary artist Annette Lemieux has pulled what  it described as her "first major one-person museum exhibition" scheduled to run  from Oct. 28 to Dec. 31. and that six sculptors also have canceled a show of  their work scheduled to run from Feb. 3 to April 8.  </P> <P> Deborah Shriver, a spokeswoman for the Corcoran, acknowledged that 10 American  painters, including Lemieux, featured in a joint U.S.-Soviet exhibition to be  presented next spring have also threatened to deny the gallery the right to  display their work.  </P> <P> The House voted this summer to cut the National Endowment of the Arts' budget  by $45,000 -- the total of federal grants received by Mapplethorpe and Andres  Serrano, a photographer whose picture of a crucifix in a jar of urine also  touched off a protest.  </P> <P> And the Senate last month approved legislation by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.)  that would prohibit federal financing of sexually explicit artwork.  </P></p>

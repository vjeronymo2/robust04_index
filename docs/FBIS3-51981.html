			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Esteban Morales, Director of the Center for </F> U.S. Studies, by Zenaida Costales; place not given -- live]    [Text] [Morales] The characteristics of the current  international relations situation -- with the world going  through a transition process, et cetera -- pose certain  challenges for the United States: that they pay more attention  to refurbishing U.S. foreign policy, to problems affecting the  role of the Armed Forces, the function of the U.S. security  policy, the importance of economic factors in future U.S.  security policy, the strategic role the United States will play  in important global problems, which will be related to U.S.  foreign political leadership in future years.    [Costales] How do you think the Cuban issue will be treated?    [Morales] Well, we must say that the fundamental  characteristics of U.S. foreign policy concerning Cuba  essentially reflect the continuation of Bush Administration  policy. However, I do not believe that the current  Administration's political language is as aggressive as that of  the Bush Administration.    Only superficial changes have been made. These changes  relate  to talks that are not negotiations as such, but discussion of  issues. Basically, I think the Bush policy is being maintained  because this policy on Cuba has much to do with the U.S.  attitude of waiting for the development of internal processes in  Cuba and how the Cuban economic reinstatement will be  established within the new international relations process.</p>

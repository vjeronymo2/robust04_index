			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Heseltine postpones de-regulation white paper Trade secretary Michael Heseltine, pictured at the conference, last night postponed the white paper on de-regulation from next Monday until after the funeral of John Smith next Friday. The decision came in response to a plea from Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade secretary. Mr Heseltine said the decision meant breaking the convention that policy statements must not be issued within three weeks of an election. The European parliament elections are on June 9.</p>

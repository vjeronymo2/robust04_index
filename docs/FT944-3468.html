			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Tiphook agrees a Dollars 12m settlement Tiphook, the transport leasing group, yesterday announced that it had reached a Dollars 12m (Pounds 7.3m) settlement of a lawsuit being brought by some of the group's US bondholders. The agreement will go before a US federal court within the next two weeks for approval. The bondholders, who started their legal action last January, had been seeking Dollars 700m, the amount Tiphook raised from three tranches of bond issues between November 1992 and April 1993. They claimed that they were sold Tiphook bonds and shares on the basis of 'materially false and misleading' information. Shortly after the final bond prospectus was issued, Tiphook announced that interim profits would be some 20 per cent below previously indicated results. The company yesterday denied claims made by representatives of the bondholders, that the final bill for Tiphook would be 'several million dollars higher', owing to modifications agreed on how the bonds are structured. Mr Leonard Barrack, of Barrack, Rodos and Bacine, lead attorneys to the bond- holders, said: 'These are non-cash benefits to the bondholders which will be agreed to over the next two weeks prior to the final signing of the settlement papers.' He added: 'Given the financial situation of this company, we are happy with the result.' Tiphook said that the outcome of the case resolved one of the biggest financial uncertainties hanging over the company. 'As far as we are concerned the Dollars 12m settlement is the end of all outstanding claims against the group in relation to the class action.' The company also stated that its half-year results, due on Thursday, would show improved trading leading to a small operating profit. However, it also warned that the results 'are likely to incorporate further exceptional provisions', and 'after payment of interest the company will report a loss'. Company sources said that group debt, currently standing at Pounds 512.5m, would be little changed, as would its hefty interest bill, which for the year to April 30 was Pounds 76m. The group's pre-tax losses for the year were Pounds 331.1m. Market talk of a financial restructuring involving the group's bankers was denied. Tiphook refused to comment on the financial affairs of Mr Robert Montague, its chief executive, who is facing a petition for bankruptcy. He is due to attend a hearing on December 22 having successfully sought an extention to gain further time to solve his problems. Royal Bank of Scotland is seeking repayment of its outstanding loans, worth in the region of Pounds 2.5m.</p>

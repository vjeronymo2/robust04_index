			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 27 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists  staged an air war exercise against the North Monday in the skies  above Umsong, Tokjok Islet, Wonju and Yongwol, South Korea, with  Pacific-based U.S. fighters and some 200 fighter-bombers,  assault planes, observation planes and helicopter gunships  belonging to the U.S. Air Force in South Korea and the puppet  airforce under the command of an E-3 early warning plane,  military sources said.    On the same day, the South Korean puppets held a firing  exercise and a helicopter operation exercise as part of the  Hwarang war exercise in a frontline area adjacent to the  Demilitarized Zone along the Military Demarcation Line.    The premeditated military provocations are rendering the  situation on the Korean peninsula more strained.    If the United States and the South Korean rulers  continuously  reinforce their aggression forces and unleash a nuclear war on  the Korean peninsula, the provokers will never get off scotfree.</p>

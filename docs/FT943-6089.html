			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Profit-taking hits Nikkei as Hong Kong rises 3.1% Small-lot profit-taking by banks depressed share prices and the Nikkei 225 average edged down in low volume, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index finished 8.23 easier at 20,592.12 after a day's low of 20,503.70 and high of 20,629.93. Selling by banks and companies ahead of the September interim book closing continued to depress investor confidence, while arbitrage buying and purchases by public funds supported the index in the afternoon. Many foreign investors were absent from trading following Monday's holiday in the UK and Hong Kong. Individual investors, meanwhile, focused trading on the over the counter market, and volume sank to 183m shares from 206m. The Topix index of all first section stocks slipped 2.71 to 1,637.37 and the Nikkei 300 lost 0.21 at 298.16. Losers led gainers by 601 to 308, with 223 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 0.82 firmer at 1,331.91. Market participants dabbled in telecommunication linked stocks ahead of Japan Telecom's listing, while some overseas investors took profits on steel shares. Traders hoped domestic institutional activity would recover when profit-taking had run its course. 'The index should be looking better in about two weeks' time,' commented a Japanese broker. Sumitomo Metal, the most active issue of the day, rose Y3 to Y348 on buying by foreigners. However, selling by overseas investors depressed NKK, Y2 lower at Y283, and carmakers Toyota Motor and Nissan Motor, which receded Y10 to Y2,140 and by Y13 to Y766 respectively. Selling by individuals drove some speculative favourites down. Sumitomo Coal Mining retreated Y46 to Y769 and Chino, a measuring instrument maker, plunged Y100 to Y817. Buying of telecommunication stocks spilled over into other high-technology issues. Sony gained Y120 at Y6,020 and Hitachi Y6 at Y981. Advantest, the semiconductor testing device maker, advanced Y80 to Y3,430 following reports of a sharp rise in profits during the first half of the current business year. Reports of improved earnings supported truck makers. Hino Motors put on Y20 at Y962 and Nissan Diesel added Y13 at Y599. In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 54.09 to 22,872.61 in volume of 48.2m shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, shed Y70 to Y6,330. Roundup Positive performances were again seen in some of the Pacific Rim markets. HONG KONG rose 3.1 per cent as it returned after a long holiday weekend and responded to Wall Street's rally and some better than expected corporate results. The Hang Seng index jumped 287.48 to 9,686.56 in turnover of HKDollars 5.19bn, against Friday's HKDollars 3.10bn, with US and Japanese institutions identified as strong buyers. Cheung Kong moved ahead HKDollars 1.60 to HKDollars 38.10 and Hutchison gained HKDollars 1.80 at HKDollars 37.60, both continuing to benefit from their results announced late last week. BANGKOK rallied through the day as active buying of blue chips alternated with slight profit-taking in finance and property issues. The SET index closed at the day's high, up 32.29 or 2.2 per cent at 1,492.53. Turnover reached a heavy Bt14.21bn. KUALA LUMPUR was lifted by institutional interest in Telekom Malaysia and the composite index rose 9.64 to 1,130.01, up from a morning's low of 1,112.95. Telekom climbed 70 cents to MDollars 21.40, adding to Monday's 40 cents advance. SEOUL was slightly higher in moderate trading on gains by low-priced issues with good earnings prospects. The composite index closed 3.84 up at 939.85 in volume that remained low at 25.8m shares. MANILA rebounded in higher volume from Monday's dip, reflecting strong support at current levels, although brokers said a correction would be welcome. The composite index ended 11.80 ahead at 3,104.07 in volume of 5.3bn shares, compared with Monday's 2.5bn. SYDNEY edged ahead in good volume, although investors were said to be cautious of Wall Street pulling back overnight. The All Ordinaries index rose 4.6 to 2,116.5. CRA gave up 44 cents to ADollars 20 as analysts said its first-half results were within expectations and that the stock now looked fully priced. SHANGHAI's A share index gained 6.6 per cent after a buying spree in large-capital issues and the blue chip, Pudong. The index put on 48.39 at 776.39. Shanghai's B shares rose for the fifth straight trading day, adding 0.94, or 1.2 per cent, at 79.38. TAIPEI saw heavy profit-taking after Monday's advance which had taken the market to a four-year high. The weighted index fell 60.24 to 6,980.28, after an intraday high of 7,069.89, in turnover of TDollars 96.7bn. Plastics shares, which led previous gains, were hardest hit, with China Petrochemical losing TDollars 1.50 at TDollars 45.30. SINGAPORE edged lower as a few sellers pushed down share prices in a market that lacked buying interest. The Straits Times Industrial index closed 6.29 off at 2,299.51. Malaysian shares traded over the counter recovered moderately in the afternoon, but pulled back slightly in the last half-hour as cautious investors preferred to take profits ahead of Malaysia's National Day holiday today.</p>

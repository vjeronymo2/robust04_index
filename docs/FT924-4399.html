			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / International Company News: Bank of Tokyo acts to aid loan-burdened affiliate BANK OF Tokyo, the Japanese foreign exchange specialist, is helping to restructure a non-bank affiliate, BOT Lease, which is burdened with an increasing amount of non-performing loans to troubled property developers. The case highlights the close relationship between Japanese banks and the so-called non-banks, which have been blamed for fuelling property and stock speculation during the late 1980s. Many of the non-banks are affiliates of commercial banks, and heavily reliant on them for funds. At the end of March, BOT Lease had about Y600bn (Dollars 4.9bn) in borrowings, including about Y170bn from the Bank of Tokyo, which has set aside Y20bn in loan-loss reserves to relieve some of the pressure on the leasing and financial company. BOT Lease, founded in October 1979, was involved in the leasing of office equipment and ships, but later became heavily exposed to the property market, which has collapsed over the past two years. The leasing company apparently provided funds to other non-banks, some of which were also exposed to the property market and have since been unable to repay the loans, adding to the pressure on BOT Lease. Apart from forgiving Y20bn in loans, the bank is likely to accept lower-than-market rate repayments on its remaining debts from BOT Lease, which is to review employee numbers and its branch network. The leasing company plans to trim staff and restructure the organisation, as well as make a third-party share allocation to lift its capital from Y1bn to Y5bn. BOT Lease expects a loss this year, but is forecasting a return to profitability in the following year.</p>

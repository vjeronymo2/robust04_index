			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Arts: The Nose - Brighton Festival The Moscow Chamber Opera has brought four programmes to Brighton. John Allison reported here earlier in the week on the first two of them, the Rostov Mysteries and the triple bill of Shostakovich and Stravinsky; another programme combines Mozart and Salieri, while on Wednesday the company gave the first of two performances of what is perhaps their most celebrated show, Boris Pokrovsky's staging of Shostakovich's early comic opera after Gogol, The Nose. Shostakovich himself give his imprimatur to Pokrovsky's realisation, which in 1974 rehabilitated the work in the Soviet Union after it had spent more than 40 years beyond the pale. It has remained in their repertoire ever since, faithfully replicated on many foreign tours. Though the New Opera Company staged it in English translation in London in the 1970s The Nose remains little known in Britain; it was composed in 1928 and first performed two years later, running for 16 performances until proscribed by Stalin. Whether the fierce satire of the pretensions of officialdom or the nose-thumbing irreverence of the music caused the main offence is not known. As a virtuoso demonstration of the young Shostakovich running through his repertory, though, (it was composed between the Second and Third Symphonies, the most 'advanced' in the canon) The Nose remains brilliantly effective. There are more more than 80 separately identified roles, and a breathless urgency to the writing, which often thins down the orchestral writing to a single line or single tone colour, hijacks the most commonplace tunes, and then throws in a virtuoso set piece - an interlude for the percussion alone, the orchestral gallop that is probably the score's most familiar number, or an extraordinary eight-part canon for voices that closes one scene. In performance the opera sometimes seems more like a revue than a through composed piece of music theatre. As the preening bureaucrat Kovalyov hunts through 1830s St Petersburg for his nose, which is masquerading as a state official, time and again confronting small-minded officialdom, the predominant mood seems one of brittle absurdity. Sometimes, though deeper currents well up, and then the constructivist dissonances give way to a lyrical melancholy that harks straight back to Musorgsky. The proportions are not quite right - the third act is too long and hangs fire before the finale but the Moscow performance plays it for all it is worth. The cast works heroically, changing roles at top speed in a brilliantly choreographed scheme, always keeping the action on a cusp between outright farce and biting social comment. It could all be driven slightly harder and made more brilliant; the orchestral playing under Vladimir Agronsky was always secure but never dashing, the singing (headed by Eduard Akimov's Kovalyov, Boris Druzhinin as his servant Ivan) was colourful, sometimes passionately intense. The Nose is never going to be more than a fringe work as far as British audiences are concerned. For Russians, though, it continues to have a huge resonance. The Moscow Chamber Opera play it like a black farce; Pokrovsky's production leaves the whole cast on stage sitting on benches to watch the unlikely events unfold, turns it into a communal ritual. Watching it unfold one quickly realises its importance to the participants. Theatre Royal, Brighton; further performance of The Nose tomorrow</p>

			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Poll surge by Russian extremists feared Reformist parties fighting Russia's parliamentary elections on December 12 are seriously concerned that a late surge by extremists will give a large share of seats to communist and neo-fascist deputies. Mr Anatoly Sobchak, mayor of St Petersburg and the veteran democrat who now leads the Movement for Democratic Reform - one of the four reformist parties  -said yesterday there was now a 'very grave threat' from the communists and even more from the neo-fascist Liberal Democratic Party, led by Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky. Mr Sobchak, who was campaigning in Krasnoyarsk, said the communists might take 10 per cent of the seats. He said an agreement had been reached between the four reformist parties - Russia's Choice, the Party of Unity and Consent, the 'Yabloko' group and his own - to withdraw candidates where it was clear one of the four was leading. This followed a call for co-operation made by Mr Yegor Gaidar, leader of Russia's Choice. However, it is far from clear that the democratic blocs can reach an effective agreement not to split their votes, and Mr Sobchak said the leadership of the four parties would meet early next week to attempt to impose discipline on their often independent-minded and inexperienced local organisations. The Russian Communist Party yesterday took part in a convention of centrist and far-left and right-wing groups held to oppose the draft Russian constitution, which will be voted on in a referendum at the same time as the parliamentary elections. The communist party is consistently scoring around 8 per cent in the polls and the Liberal Democrats have surged from under 2 per cent to around the same levels. The polls all show as much as half of the electorate still undecided, while party leaders touring the country have consistently remarked on the strength of feeling for Mr Zhirinovsky, whose populist style has gone down well on TV. A spokesman for the 'Yabloko' group said last night that the four-party agreement was only at regional level and no decision had been taken to agree a share-out of constituencies at national level. Mr Arkady Murashov, one of the leaders of Russia's Choice, confirmed that the four parties would meet next week.</p>

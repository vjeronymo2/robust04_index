			<p><P> July 10, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH TRIPS ON POLISH NAME BUT REAGAN STILL THE CHAMP  </P> <P> President Bush stumbled today when he tried to pronounce a tongue-twisting  Polish surname, but linguists rated his attempt superior to former President  Ronald Reagan's efforts in Russian.  </P> <P> Before delivering a speech at the Polish Parliament, Bush turned to greet  Senate Speaker Andrzej Stelmachowski. He pronounced the third syllable of the  name chow, as if it rhymed with now.  </P> <P> In fact, in Polish the syllable is pronounced hoff.  </P> <P> Poles watching Bush on live television noticed the slip but said it was a  forgivable error and Bush's meaning was clear.  </P> <P> Reagan, Bush's predecessor, delighted in reciting Russian proverbs to Soviet  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev when they met at summits. However, Reagan's  pronunciation was so thick that neither Gorbachev nor his wife, Raisa, ever  seemed to understand.  </P> <P> Poland proved embarrassing linguistic territory for former President Jimmy  Carter in a 1977 visit to Warsaw when his interpreter mistranslated several  bland presidential remarks. Among other gaffes, he had Carter saying that he  wanted to learn of the carnal desires of Poles and that he had just abandoned  the United States.  </P></p>

			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures suffered the brunt of a wave of US selling in London yesterday as worries over profit margins at UK companies was matched by optimistic comments on Federal Reserve inflation policies. The Footsie September future traded at a discount to the cash market for most of the day and trading volumes were high, at more than 21,000 lots in the December contract by the end of the day. Early deals saw September edge higher to 3,207, but this picture quickly changed as BTR's trading statement upset the market. The contract was sold down to 3,157 at the day's worst. The contract then steadied to trade around the 3,175 area, closing the official trading day at 3,177, which was a discount of 3 points to cash compared with a fair value premium worth around 3 points. Switching into the December contract continued, with the September/December premium at around 13 points. Traded options saw increased turnover of 53,666 contracts, with the FT-SE 100 option recording 26,721. The Euro FT-SE option was also busy, while individual stock options were headed by BTR, which traded 4,733 lots. British Gas, which also announced trading results yesterday, had 4,967 contracts dealt in an active session, and Hanson (1,903) and Glaxo (1,080) were also busy.</p>

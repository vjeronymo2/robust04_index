			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: No real argument for local government change Sir, I must respond to Councillor Mrs Duddy (Letters, August 30). The current review of local government has been built on unsubstantiated assertion. No evidence has been produced to demonstrate convincingly that unitary local government is, per se, better than two-tier. There are many examples of the unitary system not working. Mrs Duddy says a unitary council in her area has the support of the business community. Yet a Macclesfield Chamber of Commerce survey shows 43 per cent of businesses want no change, compared with 33 per cent that want a unitary Macclesfield Council. Nor do the people of Macclesfield want change. In a new survey by the Harris Research Centre 70 per cent of people in Macclesfield support 'no change'. Perhaps more significantly 77 per cent of Macclesfield residents consider that the present system of local government is successful, and only 13 per cent think that change is definitely needed. As for the Local Government Commission's two unitary options for Cheshire, no more than 6 or 7 per cent of Macclesfield people support either of them. According to the commission, change in Cheshire would cost Pounds 23m to Pounds 29m; it could cost Pounds 2m more to run, and savings, 'if any', might be Pounds 4m. These costings are highly speculative, as we know, and there is every chance the costs of change will never be recovered. In the Harris survey 80 per cent of people are not prepared to pay more either for their local government services or to change to the system. Finally, she describes the two-tier system as an 'anachronism'. Why, then, do all European Union countries, except Luxembourg, have multi-tiered local government?

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yi Kwang-tok from Washington] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said that the third  round of U.S.-North Korean talks will be held only if North  Korea accepts additional inspections by a International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA] team and complies with a North-South  dialogue. In addition, he has refused North Korea's recent  proposals to discuss the issue of the additional inspections at  the third U.S.-North Korean talks.    Foreign Minister Han, who is now staying in Washington to  seek joint measures for resolving the North Korean nuclear  issue, made those remarks prior to a meeting with U.S. Secretary  of State Christopher. He added that if North Korea does not  accept the IAEA's request for additional inspections, the  international community, including the United Nations, will have  no choice other than imposing sanctions on North Korea.    Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said that if North Korea does  not change its attitude but instead strongly reacts to the  international community by withdrawing from the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty, the international community, including  the ROK, the United States, and the United Nations, will respond  strongly.    Foreign Minister Han said: During the ROK-PRC summit talks  and the ROK-PRC foreign ministers' talks, China stressed that it  would exercise influence over North Korea only if a phase of  North-South dialogue continues. China has also asked the ROK  side to create an atmosphere in which China can fully play a  role in resolving the nuclear issue.    In addition, Foreign Minister Han said that he would meet  with U.S. Secretary of State Christopher to discuss if the UN  Security Council will adopt a statement in the name of its  president or adopt a resolution. He stressed that if the UN  Security Council adopts the statement, it will include the  deadline for North Korean nuclear inspections and additional  steps at the UN level. Foreign Minister Han is expected to meet  UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and representatives of  the permanent member states of the UN Security Council on 31  March and ask for their cooperation.</p>

Erik Zuleta, general secretary of the Lara Automotive Union,  reported that at the meeting held by the Bloc of Transportation  Unions of the Central and Central-Eastern States, it was agreed  to initiate the strike as of Tuesday. This move will leave the  following states without public transportation along city and  inter-city routes: Tachira, Merida, Trujillo, Falcon, Zulia,  Barinas, Portuguesa, Yaracuy, Apure, Cojedes, and Lara, as well  as part of Carabobo.    Zuleta said the transportation strike will hit the nation's  central area, the central-western region, the Andes, and the  western flatlands. The strike will be staged indefinitely until  the Transportation and Communications Ministry responds to a  document turned over by Fedetransporte [expansion unknown] in  October in which the problems of more than 80,000 transportation  sector workers are spelled out. The demands include an increase  in the minimum wage, the elimination of the VAT [value-added  tax], and that the state absorb the cost of the student tariff.  Zuleta indicated that the transportation workers are not  willing to continue subsidizing this service that should be  assumed by the government.    In addition, the secretary general of the Lara Automotive  Union said that one of the main points for resolving the tariff  problem is the need for the government to establish official  tariffs for urban, suburban, metropolitan, and countryside  transportation. The decision made by the Bloc of Transportation  Unions has already been made. The strike will be initiated on  Tuesday for an indefinite period until the bloc receives a  satisfactory reply from the government. The workers have been  waiting for this reply for three months.</p>

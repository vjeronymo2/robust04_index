			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Echoes of Just Cause as Noriega's star rises: The 1989 invasion of Panama may become an issue in this year's US presidential election AS the drug trafficking conspiracy trial of General Manuel Antonio Noriega, the former Panamanian leader, creaks to a conclusion - yesterday marked its 69th day - speculation is growing that he might be acquitted on at least some of the main counts. Simultaneously, the possibility grows that the 1989 US invasion of Panama might become an issue in this year's US presidential campaign. President George Bush's Desert Storm victory last year no longer resonates with voters. A rejection by the jurors in the Miami trial of all or most of the charges against Gen Noriega would mean that the rationale of an earlier foreign policy action - Operation Just Cause, which sought the general's capture - would be open to question. Although it is open to debate how the jury will react to what they have heard, the general's prosecutors do not appear to have had a good week. For this, they can blame a dead man, a self-styled political refugee and a fiery Panamanian woman legislator. The dead man - Mr William Casey, the Reagan-era director of Central Intelligence - cropped up when a former CIA Panama station chief testified that Mr Casey had met Gen Noriega in Panama days after Gen Noriega held a Havana tete-a-tete with President Fidel Castro in 1984. Gen Noriega told Mr Casey what Mr Castro had to say about Central America and exchanged gifts with the intelligence chief - Mr Casey's book for the general, some of the general's private stock of Cuban cigars for Mr Casey. This evidence appears to have bolstered the defence claim that Gen Noriega was an important US ally. The self-styled political refugee - Mr Rodolfo Castrellon, Panama Air Force officer and former ambassador to Israel during the Noriega regime  - denied a key element in the government's case that the general was involved in a conspiracy with the Medelln drugs cartel. Mr Castrellon contradicted a claim by a government witness that a group of Colombian cocaine chemists captured by the Panamanians had been returned to Colombia on a champagne flight via executive jet - demonstrating Gen Noriega's cosy relationship with Colombian drug interests. Mr Castrellon, who has sought political asylum in the US claiming fear of persecution in Panama, was the air force officer who arranged the return flight. He identified photographs which showed that the aircraft used was an old cargo aircraft and the passengers wore chains. The Panamanian legislator - Mrs Balbina Herrera  - had been identified by one of the government's earliest witnesses - former drug dealer Mr Max Marmelstein - as a 1983 contact with whom he arranged landing rights for drug-carrying aircraft in Panama. But Mrs Herrera furiously branded that testimony a lie and said that in 1983 she was working as a junior-grade economist in an institute of the Department of Education which provided scholarships to Panamanian secondary and university students. None of this testimony would, of itself, damage a strong prosecution case. The government's problem is that there are doubts about how well the overall case against the general is holding up. Panamanian journalists covering the trial report widespread belief in Panama, where the trial receives more attention than in the US, that Gen Noriega may be acquitted. Last week, Panamanian vice-president Guillermo Ford told a Miami audience that the his government had decided that, were the general to be freed, Panama would seek his extradition. Mr Ford acknowledged, however, that no criminal charges had been laid against Gen Noriega in Panama. The jurors will be instructed by the judge that they should vote to convict only if they find the general's guilt proved beyond reasonable doubt. But some attorneys who have been following the case think the jurors will decide their verdict based more on their attitude toward the government as an institution than on the complex evidence they have heard in the months since the start of the trial last September. If that view is correct, another week like this one could mean problems for the government side.</p>

			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / International Company News: Dow bids for stake in east German operation Dow Deutschland, a subsidiary of Dow Chemical of the US, is seeking to buy a majority stake in east Germany's former state oil and chemical operations after it has completed an extensive evaluation study, company officials said yesterday. An investment by Dow, which has been seeking a foothold in eastern Germany for some time, would boost prospects by the Treuhand privatisation agency to find additional partners for the Leuna/Buna/Bohlen chemical complex in the eastern German state of Saxony-Anhalt. In its letter of intent to the Treuhand, Dow has targeted its interest on the steam cracker facilities at the Sachsische Olefinwerke in Bohlen, the electrochemical units and derivative operations at Buna, in Schkopau, and the polyolefin and intermediate chemical operations at Leuna. The decision on what it will buy will be made by the end of the year. All three facilities formed the nucleus of east Germany's chemical sector under the former communists. Since unification, the Treuhand has been engaged in a massive restructuring programme aimed at attracting investors to install a new steam cracker facility and oil refinery in the region. Despite overcapacity in the chemical industry in Europe, a Dow official said: 'East Germany is part of our long-term strategy in Europe. 'We are looking for a better position to serve all of Europe, not only west, but also eastern Europe.' The official added Germany's state and federal authorities were expected to provide 'the normal grants' for such an investment. Dow's European operations have an annual turnover of Dollars 4bn. The Treuhand has been providing generous financial investment incentives for the Leuna/Buna/Bohlen chemical sector in which 68,500 people had been employed before 1990. This figure has sharply fallen to 12,300 through closures, redundancies and early retirement schemes. At the same time, the Treuhand, backed by the finance ministry, has picked up the sector's DM3.5bn (Dollars 2.27bn) old debts and has provided a further DM5.5bn in real investments which will increased to DM8.7bn by 1998.</p>

			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROFOOTBALL / WEEK 6;  </P> <P> THE OTHER GAMES  </P> <P> GAME OF THE DAY  </P> <P> Washington (3-2) at New York Giants (4-1), 10 a.m.  </P> <P> The Giants were making an early move to run away with the NFC East until  Philadelphia rallied last week to beat them in the final minutes, and now the  Redskins can bring New York back to the pack. Washington had a comeback of its  own last week behind Mark Rypien, scoring 17 points in the fourth quarter to  beat Phoenix. The Redskins had the Giants beaten in the season opener until a  fumble by Gerald Riggs led to a 27-24 victory for New York. Giant Lawrence  Taylor has 6 1/2 sacks, including Randall Cunningham twice last week.  </P> <P> INTERCONFERENCE GAMES  </P> <P> Houston (2-3) at Chicago (4-1), 10 a.m.  </P> <P> With the Oilers struggling, there has been talk in Houston that Jerry  Glanville's job is on the line and that running back Mike Rozier, who has  carried the ball only twice this season, may be traded. The Bears are getting  plenty of offense from Mike Tomczak and Neal Anderson, the NFL's leading rusher  with 530 yards, but last week Vinny Testaverde shredded the Chicago defense,  which had allowed only 15 points a game. Houston is 9-18 on the road under  Glanville, and the Bears are 23-4 at Soldier Field since 1986.  </P> <P> New York Jets (1-4) at New Orleans (1-4), 1 p.m.  </P> <P> Things go from bad to worse for the Jets, who lost wide receiver Al Toon for  four weeks with two sprained ankles. That won't help Kyle Mackey, who replaces  Ken O'Brien at quarterback. New York has scored only 29 points in first-half  play this season, one touchdown in the first quarter. The Saints led San  Francisco, 17-3, before losing. Without Rueben Mayes, New Orleans needs help  from Ironhead Heyward.  </P> <P> New England (2-3) at Atlanta (1-4), 10 a.m.  </P> <P> Patriot quarterback Doug Flutie doesn't pile up the numbers, just victories.  However, even more important was the return of running back John Stephens in  last week's win over Houston. Atlanta quarterback Chris Miller, who passed for  340 yards against the Rams, could have another big day against New England's  defense, which has been weakened by injuries. The Falcons are better than their  record, but had to play the Rams, the NFL's only unbeaten team, twice in the  first five weeks. Deion Sanders will get his first start in the Falcon  secondary.  </P> <P> AFC GAMES  </P> <P> Indianapolis (3-2) at Denver (4-1), 1 p.m.  </P> <P> TV: Channel 4.  </P> <P> The Broncos are glad to be 4-1 but can't wait to see what happens when John  Elway gets going. Elway pulled a leg muscle in practice this week, so Gary  Kubiak may have to replace him. Rookie running back Bobby Humphrey and an  improved defense have made the difference for Denver. The Colts are tied with  Buffalo atop the AFC East by making up for injuries to Chris Chandler and Eric  Dickerson. Indianapolis has allowed only two touchdowns while winning three in  a row and is getting solid quarterbacking from Jack Trudeau. Indianapolis  routed Denver last season, 55-23, scoring 45 points in the first half.  </P> <P> Miami (2-3) at Cincinnati (4-1), 10 a.m.  </P> <P> The Dolphins aren't what they used to be but have to be reckoned with every  week because of Dan Marino, who led an overtime upset of Cleveland last week.  The Bengals are winning, despite having lost Ickey Woods for the season and an  injury that has slowed quarterback Boomer Esiason, because the defense hasn't  allowed more than 17 points in any game. James Brooks has helped ease the loss  of Woods by running for 429 yards. Cincinnati leads the league in rushing.  </P> <P> Seattle (2-3) at San Diego (2-3), 1 p.m.  </P> <P> With the Kingdome not so kind this season, the Seahawks have had to go on the  road for their two victories. Dave Krieg ranks with the AFC passing leaders,  but Seattle has had trouble shaking Curt Warner and John L. Williams loose. The  Chargers have been able to run the ball, but Jim McMahon has been unable to  generate much passing offense. San Diego has beaten Seattle only twice in 12  games.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh (2-3) at Cleveland (3-2), 1 p.m.  </P> <P> The Steelers aren't as bad as they seemed in a 51-0 loss to Cleveland in the  first week of the season, but will have to go with Todd Blackledge at  quarterback, since Bubby Brister suffered a knee injury last week. Bernie Kosar  and the Browns have to be smarting since being slowed by penalties and scoring  only 10 points in an overtime loss in Miami. Cleveland has won eight of the  last nine games in this series.  </P> <P> NFC GAMES  </P> <P> San Francisco (4-1) at Dallas (0-5), 10 a.m.  </P> <P> TV: Channel 2.  </P> <P> The Cowboys got five players for Herschel Walker, but it will take time to work  them into Jimmy Johnson's scheme. Not that anything figures to help this week.  The 49ers ought to be able to get Joe Montana and his sore right arm off the  field early and give Steve Young some work. San Francisco, however, seems to be  playing to the level of the competition, rallying in the second half in all  four victories and losing to the Rams. The Cowboys were worse only in 1960, the  year they joined the league and were 0-11-1.  </P> <P> Green Bay (3-2) at Minnesota (3-2), 10 a.m.  </P> <P> To challenge Chicago in the NFC Central, the resurgent Packers must first get  past Minnesota, which they did twice last season, 34-14 and 18-6. Green Bay has  won seven of the last eight in Minnesota. The offense Lindy Infante brought  from Cleveland is making Don Majkowski look like Bernie Kosar, especially in  the second half, in which Packers have outscored opponents, 104-23. The Vikings  hope Herschel Walker will help them bounce back from a disappointing start,  although at 3-2, the Vikings still are in the thick of the battle. Minnesota is  ranked No. 1 in defense, Green Bay No. 1 in offense.  </P> <P> Philadelphia (3-2) at Phoenix (2-3), 1 p.m.  </P> <P> Buddy Ryan's Eagles have developed into a strong road team, having won five of  their last six games. Randall Cunningham had the worst passing game of his  career -- 106 yards -- but brought the Eagles back to beat the Giants last  week. With Roy Green out with a broken collarbone, the Cardinals must depend on  J. T. Smith, who caught three touchdown passes last week.  </P> <P> Detroit (0-5) at Tampa Bay (3-2), 10 a.m.  </P> <P> The Lions hope to have both Rodney Peete and Barry Sanders near full speed for  the first time this season, and will need those highly regarded rookies, the  way Ray Perkins has the Buccaneers playing. Vinny Testaverde is living up to  his promise, and Tampa Bay has only nine turnovers in five games. The  Buccaneers swept the Lions for the first time last season, 23-20 and 21-10.  Detroit is 0-5 for the first time since 1955.  </P> <P> NOTE: All times PDT. Standings, Page 17.  </P></p>

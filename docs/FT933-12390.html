			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Cost to business of MMC probes examined THE GOVERNMENT yesterday an-nounced that it was appointing consultants to carry out a wide-ranging management review of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission - including a look at the costs to business of MMC inquiries. Price Waterhouse, the management consultants, will carry out the review, which will cost less than Pounds 100,000, the Department of Trade and Industry said yesterday. The review came amid continuing debate about the role and structure of the UK competition authorities. Industrialists have complained that there is too much duplication between the MMC and the Office of Fair Trading, while consumer groups have said the commission has 'gone soft' on companies it has investigated. The commission said that it was routinely reviewed every five years. 'This is not an unusual departure,' it added. Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, said the review would cover 'all aspects of the financial management and organisation of the MMC'. It would also reflect other issues of concern to ministers, particularly costs to businesses. The DTI said the costs of commission inquiries would be considered as a matter of course by such a review, but even so the news was welcomed by industry. The Confederation of British Industry said: 'Major industry-wide inquiries can cost millions.' When small and medium-sized enterprises were involved in an inquiry their ability to handle day-to-day business could be 'seriously impaired'. The review will also evaluate the scope for a programme of market testing of commission functions - looking at the efficiency of the commission and whether it is giving value for money. The commission employs 110 people and has an annual budget of Pounds 5m. It said yesterday that it always tried to carry out its role with the least burden or cost to the parties involved. It added that its reputation depended on the efficacy of its reports. The last review of the commission was carried out internally in 1986. The timing of the latest review takes account of the appointment of a new chairman in April when Mr Graeme Odgers replaced Sir Sydney Lipworth. Price Waterhouse was appointed after a competitive tender involving six other companies. It is expected to begin work on August 4 and to report by the beginning of October.</p>

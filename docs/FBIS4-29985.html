			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta (JP) -- Minister/State Secretary Murdiono,  while defending the record of President Suharto's New Order  government, agreed yesterday that the time has come for  Indonesia to adopt a more open political system.    Any political system must be dynamic and open to change in  accordance with the demands of the situation and the conditions  of the time, Murdiono said in a seminar to review the  performance of the New Order government.    "It is a fact that the global political trend demands  greater  political openness and greater respect for human rights. These  clearly must be taken into consideration," he said at the  seminar organized by the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI).    "We already have laid the basis for a more open political  format that also gives more respect to human rights," he said,  referring to the 1993-98 State Policy Guidelines endorsed by the  People's Consultative Assembly last year.    During the ensuing discussion, Murdiono said he was  concerned  that the political openness now being pursued by the government  had been misinterpreted by some people.    The government, he said, is advocating transparency, which  is  not the same as being completely open.    The main difficulty in the move towards greater openness is  in ensuring that it does not lead to anarchy, he said, stressing  that all parties must treat the issue with responsibility.    Murdiono was the last speaker of the two-day LIPI seminar  that was held in memory of the late Alfian, a political thinker  who analyzed the New Order administration extensively during his  lifetime.    The phrase New Order describes the successive  administrations  of President Suharto, who has ruled the nation since 1966. The  period between independence in 1945 and 1965 under president  Sukarno is described as the Old Order.    Murdiono said it was during the New Order era that the  country for the first time managed to establish the frame of  reference upon which the political system is built. This is  based on Pancasila, the state ideology, and the Constitution.    During Sukarno's time the nation went from one upheaval to  another as it experienced various political systems which were  alien to Indonesia.    Murdiono posed the question whether he thought the political  format of the New Order government has been successful and  whether it was consistent with the 1945 Constitution. "Without  doubt, I will answer yes," he said.    The minister also said that some of the credit, but not all,  for the political concepts developed during the New Order should  go to the Armed Forces (ABRI) for playing its political role  through its "Dual-Function" doctrine in defense and politics.    "It cannot be denied that these concepts had military  connotations," said Murdiono, a retired army lieutenant general  who has spent most of his public career in civilian clothes.    He said ABRI would be the first to acknowledge that it is  only a part of the national power, and that it sees its task as  helping to develop the other potentials. "Through this point of  view, it is natural that the military is directly or indirectly  concerned with the national development."    Murdiono said the military never claimed all the credit for  the achievements of the New Order. "A phenomenon which will be  politically interesting to analyze is that despite its major  political role, ABRI's budget is one of the smallest. It is  even more interesting that ABRI's leadership have calmly  accepted this."</p>

			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. -- CHINA RELATIONS REACH AN UNHAPPY UPCOMING ANNIVERSARY;  </P> <P> DIPLOMACY: SECRET MEETINGS AND SOOTHING COMMENTS FAILED. THE ADMINISTRATION  COMES TO REALIZE THE FUTILITY OF TRYING BUSINESS AS USUAL WITH BEIJING.  </P> <P> China seems headed for a springtime of sensitive anniversaries and bad  memories. At the same time, relations between the United States and the Chinese  regime of Deng Xiaoping head for the deep freeze, as Bush Administration  officials belatedly realize they must wait for far-reaching changes in China's  leadership before they can even hope to restore once-close ties.  </P> <P> In retrospect, President Bush's overtures to the Chinese leadership last year  -- particularly his decision to dispatch National Security Adviser Brent  Scowcroft and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger twice on secret  missions to Beijing -- were a failure. They did not bring about an end to  Chinese repression. They did not assure safe release for Chinese leading  dissident, Fang Lizhi, now in refuge at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.  </P> <P> And they did not set in motion a process enabling Congress and the American  public, on one side, or the old guard in China's leadership, on the other, to  become more accommodating. On the contrary: It can be argued that the secret  missions served merely to accentuate fundamental disagreements between the two  governments. In its very eagerness to prevent change, the Bush Administration  managed to accelerate it.  </P> <P> Two months ago, Bush was boasting that, in the wake of Scowcroft's December  meeting with Deng, China had toned down hard-line rhetoric against the United  States. But in recent weeks China's rhetoric has taken on a hard edge, just as  it did last fall. Chinese leaders continue to suggest that the United States  has been plotting to overthrow Chinese communism through a strategy of  "peaceful evolution." The official Chinese press has heaped abuse on U.S.  intervention in the world, citing Bush's invasion of Panama as most recent  example. "What right does a hegemonist that wantonly infringes on other  countries' rights and bullies the weak by force have in prating about human  rights?" asked one publication.  </P> <P> There has been a continuation of cultural and educational exchanges, but at  reduced levels. After months of wrangling, the two countries agreed to continue  the Fulbright scholars' exchange program next year, but the number of people  has been cut back by one-third. China has refused to send students abroad for  some exchange programs, including one run by Johns Hopkins University. The  United States is considering a possible phase-out of the once-touted program  run by the State University of New York to teach business management to Chinese  students in the city of Dalian. The Bush Administration was particularly  embarrassed when the Chinese imposed new rules making it harder for students to  study abroad.  </P> <P> Now, seeking to limit the political damage, Administration officials gradually  modify their public statements on China. Back in January, Bush and Vice  President Dan Quayle repeatedly assured the nation that the Scowcroft mission  had brought about important concrete results. But two weeks ago, in an  interview with NBC's Tom Brokaw, the President admitted that "there hasn't been  much give" from the Chinese leadership yet, and "I wish there would be more."  </P> <P> In a separate TV interview, Quayle responded to a question about the  Administration overture to China, "I will not say it's been a failure. It's  been a disappointment . . . . China refuses to recognize reality, and that's  freedom and democracy eventually." Those last words were probably more  irritating and threatening to the Chinese leadership than anything said on  Capitol Hill.  </P> <P> In private, some of the principal American architects of the once-close U.S.  ties with China put out the word that the Chinese leadership should not hope  for further unilateral U.S. concessions. Last month, Chinese Ambassador to the  United States Zhu Qizhen travelled to the New Jersey home of Richard M. Nixon  for a small dinner with the former President and some prominent American  leaders in politics and business. According to one participant, the ambassador  argued that now was the time for the Bush Administration to take a major new  step in improving relations; Zhu wanted the United States to open the way for  more and speedier World Bank loans to China. But former Democratic Party  Chairman Robert Strauss told the ambassador that Bush had already gone as far  as he could go without major changes in Beijing; when it comes to China,  Strauss said, Bush has no political running room left. Nixon said he agreed.  </P> <P> Over the next few weeks, the young and disaffected in China will have a number  of opportunities to demonstrate displeasure. Qing Ming festival occurs in early  April, the annual Chinese commemoration of the dead -- including the hundreds,  if not thousands, killed in the vicinity of Tian An Men Square last June.  Throughout the spring, China will mark the anniversary of key moments in last  year's tumultuous pro-democracy demonstrations. The leading organization of  Chinese dissidents in France and the United States, the Federation for  Democracy in China, has purchased a 1,140-ton ship and outfitted it with a  radio transmitter, hoping to broadcast to the mainland from international  waters off the Chinese coastline.  </P> <P> The Chinese regime will probably be able to prevent or shut down any new  trouble in the streets. Yet new, publicized confrontations will deter any  Chinese efforts to restore ties with the United States and other Western  nations. The next possible battle in Congress over Administration overtures  toward Beijing may come later this spring, when China comes up for annual  renewal of its most-favored nation status, the trade classification assuring  the lowest possible tariffs on exports to the United States. A change in  China's trade status would be the most severe economic blow the United States  could impose, short of something no one wants -- a return to the old days of a  trade embargo.  </P> <P> As it sought to defend and bolster its China policy, the Bush Administration  has often found itself ensnarled in a series of seeming contradictions.  Sometimes U.S. officials have insisted that Deng, now 85 and in frail health,  is in command and still committed to reforming China. On other occasions, they  have mourned that the Chinese leadership is so beset by divisions that no bold  action is possible. Sometimes Administration officials have argued that China  is as strategically important to the United States as it ever was. On other  occasions, they acknowledge that, given the dramatic changes in Eastern Europe  and the Soviet Union, China's strategic significance has changed.  </P> <P> Coming up with a new foreign-policy rationale for the old, close ties with  China -- a relationship forged in the Nixon era and based on shared opposition  to the Soviet Union -- is not easy. Recently, on Capitol Hill, Eagleburger  maintained that China is important to the United States because of the  proliferation of missiles, nuclear weapons and chemical weapons around the  world. That strange argument suggested that the more missiles and weapons China  sells, the more important to the United States it will become. Meanwhile, Nixon  himself has been pressing the argument that the United States needs China's  help to prevent Japan from becoming a political and military superpower. Such  talk does nothing to help U.S. ties with Japan, currently America's closest  ally in Asia.  </P> <P> Last fall, Bush and the Chinese were essentially trying to see whether they  could could repair relationships after Tian An Men. Now, it seems less  possible. In the United States, public attitudes toward China have changed.  Within the Chinese leadership, opinions about the United States seem to have  changed. Both countries find it difficult to return to business as usual in a  changing world.  </P></p>

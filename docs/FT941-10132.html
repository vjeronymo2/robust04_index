			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Britain 'bowed to US pressure' over Bosnia ultimatum: Decision to support Nato plan averted damaging rift with Washington Britain acquiesced in this week's Nato ultimatum to the Serbian forces besieging Sarajevo only after a blunt warning from the US that refusal would permanently damage the western alliance. The acknowledgement that Britain had bowed to US and French pressure came as Conservative MPs voiced deep concern that the threat of Nato air strikes might draw the west into greater military involvement in Bosnia. After a meeting with senior ministers, the MPs said they would push for an immediate withdrawal of the 2,500 British troops in Bosnia if the 10-day ultimatum brought an escalation in the conflict. But as the government temporarily suspended its aid convoys in Bosnia for fear of retaliation by Serbian forces, ministers admitted that the choice had been between supporting the Nato plan and a damaging rift with the US. It is understood that President Bill Clinton made clear US determination to take action to end the siege of Sarajevo during a telephone conversation with Mr John Major on Wednesday. Senior ministers said Mr Clinton believed that failure to act would strengthen the hand of those in Washington arguing for a much faster and bigger disengagement of US forces from Europe. Downing Street last night denied that the conversation between Mr Major and Mr Clinton had forced the government's hand, insisting the decision to back the Nato plan had been taken before the two men spoke. However, then ministers said a shift in the French stance in favour of the air strikes also undercut Mr Major's position that air strikes posed too serious a threat to the troops on the ground. France has committed more troops than Britain to Bosnia. One senior minister said that in such circumstances it would have been 'disastrous' for the future of the alliance to oppose the ultimatum. Mr Major, whose government was seriously at odds with Mr Clinton over the admission to the US this month of Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, judged that Britain could not afford another damaging breach. Significant tensions still remained within the cabinet before the decision to go along with the US was taken. The ministers said the cabinet had agreed to the ultimatum only after military commanders on the ground said limited use of air power was feasible and that the risk to British troops could be contained. It was also agreed that if air strikes failed in their objective, there would be no further escalation in British military involvement. In a Commons statement, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, alluded repeatedly to the tensions within the western alliance when he said there was a need to preserve a united front within Nato. The government had backed the ultimatum because 'there is a strong British interest in maintaining the strength and solidarity of Nato'. He also emphasised hopes that the demilitarisation of Sarajevo would speed the process towards a political settlement in Bosnia. But he admitted: 'No one would pretend that this was an easy decision.' Mr Hurd was joined by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, in an attempt to calm Tory backbench fears at a hastily convened meeting last night. The two ministers stressed that contingency plans had been made to secure the safety of British troops and, if necessary, to withdraw them. The ministers stressed also the advantages of the new US commitment to more active involvement in the search for a peaceful settlement. Washington had made it clear it is still opposed to the involvement of US troops, but British ministers hope the Bosnian Moslems will be persuaded that the US can no longer be relied on as a 'secret ally'.

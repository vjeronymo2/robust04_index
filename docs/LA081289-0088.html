			<p><P> August 12, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRITISH PUB SCRAPS 'GAYS ONLY' RULE  </P> <P> A British pub that refused to serve a thirsty customer unless he declared  himself a homosexual agreed Friday to scrap its "gays only" rule.  </P> <P> Terry Scott was livid with the barman at The Sun pub when he dropped into the  bar in Bradford, northern England.  </P> <P> "I asked for a lager and the barman said I could not be served unless I was  100% gay. I was really angry; nobody should be turned away from a pub in those  circumstances," Scott said.  </P> <P> Sun licensee Adrian Thorley was unavailable for comment, but a spokesman for  the brewery that owns the pub said Thorley had agreed to scrap the "homosexuals  only" rule.  </P> <P> "When a new man goes into a pub there always tends to be selective door  control. However, we do not like pubs to become exclusive to anyone, and Mr.  Thorley has assured us that this will not be the case from now on," the  spokesman added.  </P></p>

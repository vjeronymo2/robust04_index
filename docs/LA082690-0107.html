			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHORTAGES PROMPT RIOTS IN SIBERIA;  </P> <P> SOVIET UNION: TOBACCO, LIQUOR, FOOD AND OTHER CONSUMER ITEMS GROW MORE SCARCE.  THE INCIDENTS ARE THE WORST YET IN THE DISINTEGRATING ECONOMY.  </P> <P> Siberians angered by shortages of liquor and cigarettes smashed cars and shop  windows, tossed firebombs and tried to storm police headquarters in the  country's most violent disturbance triggered by the disintegrating Soviet  economy.  </P> <P> More than 100 people were detained and dozens were injured in three days of  riots ending early Saturday that shook Chelyabinsk, a large industrial city  1,200 miles east of Moscow.  </P> <P> The uprising was another indication of the Soviet people's frustration over  their government's inability to provide them with the consumer goods they want  and need.  </P> <P> A crowd of about 1,500 people, many of them reportedly drunken youths, gathered  Friday night near a local government building and made their way through the  city, tossing Molotov cocktails and smashing several cars and an ambulance on  the way to the regional Communist Party headquarters, the official Tass news  agency reported.  </P> <P> Police attempted to block the protesters, but a group of city officials,  including Chelyabinsk's deputy mayor, demanded that the march continue, saying  they would be responsible for the crowd's actions.  </P> <P> At midnight, the crowd held a rally at the party headquarters, demanding better  food and other consumer goods. When party officials tried to talk to the crowd,  they were silenced with insults and curses shouted at them through bullhorns.  </P> <P> The protesters demanded the release of rioters who were detained during  disturbances the previous night and attempted to storm the Interior Ministry  building where their comrades presumably were being held, but they were  repulsed by police.  </P> <P> Rioters smashed windows as the crowd dispersed at about 1 a.m. Saturday, Tass  reported.  </P> <P> The latest rampage in the city of more than 1 million people on the eastern  slopes of the Ural mountains followed two days of similar outbursts. On  Wednesday, angry consumers lined up for alcohol at the largest supermarket in  Chelyabinsk went on a rampage, shouting "Give us sausage, give us sugar, give  us tobacco!" when sales clerks refused to open the doors without police to  maintain order.  </P> <P> Seventeen policemen were wounded and 13 police cars damaged in the ensuing  violence, and 138 people were detained, Tass reported. "Drunken youths armed  with sticks and stones broke bus windows," the news agency said, and police  moved in with rubber truncheons to club and disperse rioters.  </P> <P> A similar protest, attracting about 400 people, broke out the next evening, the  Interfax news service reported.  </P> <P> Valery P. Pustovoi, chief of the city interior ministry, said by telephone  Saturday that Chelyabinsk became calm after the mayor appealed for order in a  televised speech.  </P> <P> Similar disturbances, but on a smaller scale, have been sparked by shortages of  cigarettes and other consumer goods in many cities across the Soviet Union this  summer.  </P> <P> In another demonstration, hundreds of taxi drivers drove in caravan through  Moscow's streets Saturday honking horns in protest over an attack at a main  Moscow taxi depot Friday night that left one driver dead. Tass reported that 25  men arrived at the depot in cars without license plates and attacked drivers  with knives and guns.  </P> <P> The country's leaders are frantically preparing a plan to transform the  sluggish economy into a market system based on supply and demand. But as the  Chelyabinsk riots show, many Soviet consumers are fed up with promises of a  better future and demand cigarettes, vodka and sausage now.  </P></p>

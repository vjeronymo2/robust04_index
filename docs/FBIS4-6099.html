			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 16 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry  started preparing Saturday [16 April] a revision draft of the  stopgap budget, since passage of the fiscal 1994 budget in the  lower house will be delayed by Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa's resignation, ministry officials said. Deliberations  on the 1994 budget, worth 73.08 trillion yen, have been stalled  amid wrangling between the ruling coalition and the opposition  camp over Hosokawa's financial transactions.    With the domestic economy finally showing signs of recovery,  the Finance Ministry wants to avoid the psychologically harmful  effects which could result from a vacuum in the budget,  officials said.    The ministry believes it is difficult for the full 1994  budget bills to be passed within the 50-day period of the  stopgap budget even if deliberations go smoothly, particularly  since there is a string of national holidays in early May.    A record stopgap budget of 11.05 trillion yen covering the  period from April 1 to May 20 was enacted April 1, when the  stalled talks made it impossible for the 1994 budget to be  implemented within fiscal 1993 that ended March 31.    If a revision of the stopgap budget is made, it will be the  first such case since fiscal 1990.    The revised budget is expected to cover a period of nearly  one month from May 21 to mid-June, since the budget for the full  year could pass the lower house in mid-May following the  national holidays, and will automatically be enacted within 30  days after being sent to the upper house.    The scale of the stopgap budget is expected to amount to 2  or  3 trillion yen, covering the minimum funds needed for public  servants.</p>

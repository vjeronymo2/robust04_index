			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Porton poised for takeover Beaufour Ipsen, the family-owned French pharmaceuticals company, should find out today whether its Pounds 65.5m recommended takeover bid for Porton International, one of the UK's first biotechnology companies, has been successful. Shareholders holding 60.2 per cent of Porton's shares, which are traded under the Stock Exchanges's Rule 4.2, have already given irrevocable undertakings to accept the French bid, worth Pounds 13.40 in cash or notes. Of those investors, the largest stake is held by Mr Wensley Haydon-Baillie, Porton's founder and ex-chairman, who stands to receive about Pounds 24m for his 36.6 per cent stake in the private company. Under a separate deal Beaufour will pick up an additional 6 per cent stake in Porton, lifting the total tranche covered by irrevocable undertakings to 66.2 per cent. Many of Porton's institutional investors, which sank Pounds 76m into the group during the 1980s but have been disappointed by its financial performance, are understood to be keen to sell their holdings. Porton's management is expected to take an initial 22 per cent stake in Speywood Holdings, a company set up by Beaufour to make the acquisition. The French group has set a 3pm deadline today to receive more than 90 per cent acceptances for its offer, which has been recommended by Kleinwort Benson, Porton's financial advisers. A potential rival offer for Porton from Scotgen Pharmaceuticals, the Anglo-US drugs company, has failed to materialise.</p>

			<p><P> March 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> KSLD-TV Channel 62, the first new TV station in the Los Angeles market in  years, went on the air Monday night with programming supplied by Home Shopping  Network, instead of Spanish-language programming as originally announced.  Station president Jack Hodin said he made the change after he was unable to  secure enough Spanish programs. "The group I had a prospective contract with  was simply not prepared to get started," Hodin said. KSLD will broadcast from 9  p.m.-6 a.m. until April 3, when it will increase to 24 hours daily. Hodin said  his station's Home Shopping programming is "differently packaged and presented"  than that carried on Channel 46. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

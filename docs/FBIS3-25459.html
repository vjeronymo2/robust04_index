Could this mean the premature return of the  Belgian UN troops?    "We have practically returned to square one," said the  Cameroonian UN envoy to Rwanda, Jacques-Roger Booh Booh, who  seemed rather disheartened on Tuesday [15 February] night when  we interviewed him by telephone in Kigali. With MINUAR [UN  Mission for the Assistance of Rwanda], he is in charge of  ensuring that the peace agreement signed in Arusha in August  1993 is applied.    However, the establishment of the transitional institutions  provided for in the agreement has already suffered a 45-day  delay. This Monday, the swearing-in ceremony had to be canceled  once again. The former single party, the MNRD [National  Revolutionary Movement for Development], "which subordinated its  involvement to that of the Liberal Party [PL]" -- the opposition  force now divided into those supporting and those against  President Habyarimana, who cannot agree on which of them will  have seats [in the institutions] -- "has not lifted its  reservations." Consequently, neither the MNRD, nor the  president, who supported this reservation, would have come  because the PL was not there. Not to mention the fact that the  MDR [Republican Democratic Movement] is getting bogged down in  the legal procedures" associated with a dispute similar to that  dogging the PL.    According to Booh Booh, "one of the elements that is  complicating matters is the draft version of an official  declaration of the parties presented by the MNRD to suspend  their conduct during the transition period." The text proposes  an amnesty for all those crimes committed up to the signing of  the peace agreement "and only to proceed with nominations to the  administration, legal authorities, and army on the basis of a  consensus. Some objections are already making the rounds, e.g.,  the draft declaration by the MNRD is not in line with the peace  agreement, which provides for the replacement of those  individuals who were corrupt, incompetent, or involved in  massacres. If a consensus has to be reached each time, then  there will no doubt be few changes made," Booh Booh explained.  The parties have to state their position on the MNRD proposal  on Wednesday. However, there was little hope in Kigali on  Tuesday evening. And time marches on.    "The resolution that created MINUAR and the resolution  adopted on 6 January are quite clear," Booh Booh stressed. "If  no progress is made in the application of the Arusha peace plan,  then the United Nations will not continue its support. The  operation is costing $700,000 per day. This is a serious  warning. It is entirely up to the Rwandans whether or not they  want to take it seriously."</p>

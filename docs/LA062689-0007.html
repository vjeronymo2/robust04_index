			<p><P> June 26, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Caretaker Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, who contracted pneumonia a day  after his Greek election defeat last week, has been placed on a dialysis  machine in critical condition with kidney complications, his doctors said. A  team of two heart specialists and three kidney specialists arrived from London,  and they were taken immediately to Athens General Hospital. Papandreou, 70, was  admitted to the hospital late Thursday with respiratory problems, which later  developed into heart and kidney trouble. Meanwhile, a crowd of supporters  gathered outside the hospital as Papandreou was visited by friends and  relatives, including his American-born ex-wife, Margaret, his four children and  his fiancee, Dimitra Liani.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REASON TO PARDON MA MAISON WINE LIST  </P> <P> When a restaurant offers perfect glassware and perfect service -- an extremely  rare occurence -- the wine-loving patron is almost prepared to overlook  problems with the wine list itself.  </P> <P> At Ma Maison, glassware and service are near-perfect and these factors do help  soothe feelings after seeing a wine list that is chosen more to impress wine  connoisseurs than to provide good wine at fair prices. The prices, though not  too high for the wines on a percentage basis, are still too much for the  average patron.  </P> <P> The list itself has the requisite choices -- fine white and red Burgundies,  Rhones, a wide range of California wines -- and then adds some surprises.  </P> <P> Among the serendipitous finds are Alsatian wines, an excellent Muscadet, a  Cahors, and a handful of fairly old red wines (such as 1967 Chateau Haut-Brion  at $165).  </P> <P> However, pricing is high. Not that you expect any bargains at a place like Ma  Maison, but by using a standard markup that is close to three times wholesale,  the price of most wines is well above $30.  </P> <P> The least expensive red wine, 1987 Saintsbury Garnet (listed as "Granit  Vineyard"), is $21. The least expensive white is a simple Entre-Deux-Mers at  $18. The least expensive sparkling wine is Louis Roederer nonvintage Brut at  $37. I was not impressed by the house sparkling wine ($20), a Blanc de Blancs  that tasted clumsy.  </P> <P> This is a true French wine connoisseur's list and includes some names that only  a wine maven would know (names like Durup, Dubreuil Fontaine, Leroy). There are  also some names I am unfamiliar with and are not listed in my reference works.  Moreover, the list has no Italian wines, no German wines, no Australian wines,  and no wines from Oregon or Washington.  </P> <P> The California list is unimaginative and the range of styles offered is  limited. Also, there is no Zinfandel and just one Pinot Noir and one Merlot.  </P> <P> However, the service we had was exceptional, knowledgeable and friendly. And  the wine we ordered, a 1987 Beaujolais Villages from George Duboeuf ($22), was  brought to the table at the proper cellar temperature. Then the waiter asked if  we wanted it placed in an ice bucket for a slight chilling.  </P> <P> The wine program is the work of Patrick Terrail, who has plans to improve the  list. Today I'd term it a fine first effort. Knowing of plans by all six  American Sofitel hotels to offer premium wine lists, I expect this one to  improve.  </P></p>

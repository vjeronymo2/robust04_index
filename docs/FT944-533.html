			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Manual workers 'behind on wages' The earnings of non-manual employees have risen more than three times as quickly in the past 15 years as those of workers in manufacturing, say government figures. Earnings of full-time non-manual employees in the private sector rose by 56.3 per cent in real terms between 1979 and 1994, Mr Phillip Oppenheim, employment minister, said in a Commons written answer. This compared with 17.6 per cent for full-time manual workers in manufacturing. Meanwhile, a Labour MP, Mr Denis McShane, said government figures showed that one in six blue-collar workers had weekly earnings before deductions of less than Pounds 150.</p>

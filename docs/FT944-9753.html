			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Equity Markets: Slowdown in trading makes for caution - London A growing mood of bullishness towards the UK equity market at the close of last week distinctly cooled as trading ground to a halt on a dismally quiet Friday afternoon. Formerly optimistic about short-term prospects after the mid-week rally following the US elections, some dealers now view the market with extreme caution in the short term, worried about the recent lack of business and the chances of a big sell-off on Wall Street. There is, however, increasing optimism for the rest of the year. But before UK equities attempt to reach some of the more realistic year-end forecasts, they have to face a significant hurdle in the form of the US Federal Reserve open market committee meeting in Washington tomorrow. Forecasts that the US Fed funds rate could be increased by up to a full point were scaled back to 50 basis points after last week's economic news, which indicated a slowing of the economy. Any less or any more than that may be interpreted as bad news for markets. Some London market strategists argue that, US influences apart, there are many good reasons for buying UK stocks. They say London traditionally enjoys a pre-Christmas run and that this year should be no exception. The Budget, scheduled for November 29, could cause problems but again most analysts are looking for a neutral outcome. Mr Edmond Warner of Kleinwort Benson, who expects a year-end FT-SE 100 standing at 3,300, says: 'Rarely can a budget have been approached with as little investor concern; prudence and rectitude have been the chancellor's watchwords since assuming office and, February's rate cut apart, he has stuck to the script.' Mr Warner adds a note of caution, however, pointing out that 'complacency is a dangerous state of mind and investors should not assume that November 29 will be without either risk or opportunity'. NatWest Securities, in its Equity Market Analysis for November, expects a cautious budget 'which will underpin rising credibility in the UK'. The securities house is in the bullish camp regarding the end-year rally and maintains a year-end forecast of 3,400. It highlights the favourable domestic factors: profits upgrades; strong cash flow which funds 6 per cent real dividend growth; and rising sterling and gilt credibility. Mr Richard Jeffrey at Charterhouse Tiley Securities insists there is room for the equity market to move 200 points higher before the year-end. The market was satisfied with last week's important company trading statements, which included double-digit dividend increases from Marks and Spencer, British Airways and BAA, and this week should see another cluster of big pay-outs.</p>

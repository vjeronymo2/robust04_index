			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> Preliminary indications from an investigation into the pre-dawn collision  Tuesday between two sportfishing boats carrying a total of 32 people point to  operator error, the Coast Guard reported Wednesday.  </P> <P> "When the weather conditions are clear, and the sea conditions are calm -- and  there's a collision -- the normal presumption is that the operators were  negligent," Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. David Tiffany said. "An investigation is  being done to determine whether there are any other facts that may explain the  accident."  </P> <P> The collision between the 50-foot Temptress, which was carrying five passengers  and three crew members, and the 65-foot Aztec, which was carrying 19 passengers  and five crew members, occurred a little before 3 a.m. near the Coronado  Islands, a popular fishing area. Three people suffered minor injuries, the  Coast Guard reported.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, a Coast Guard helicopter responded to a distress call about 8  p.m. after a crew member on board a sportfishing boat got his hand caught in a  hatch and severed several fingers.  </P> <P> Tiffany said the accident occurred about 100 miles southwest of San Diego on  board the Champ, operating out of Fisherman's Landing in Point Loma. He said  the crew member, whose age and name were unavailable Wednesday night, was being  flown to a hospital in San Diego.  </P></p>

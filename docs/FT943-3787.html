			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Clarke lifts base rates half a point: Markets stay calm after anti-inflation increase to 5.75% Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, moved to nip inflationary pressures in the bud by announcing a half-percentage-point increase in bank base rates to 5.75 per cent yesterday. It was the first officially inspired rise in rates for nearly five years and more than reversed February's controversial quarter-point cut, which pegged base rates at the unusually low level of 5.25 per cent for the past seven months. Yesterday's decision, signalled by an increase in the Bank of England's minimum lending rate at the start of money market dealings, promises to be no less controversial. Marking a decisive turn in the UK interest-rate cycle, Mr Clarke's announcement disappointed business organisations and came as the City had all but convinced itself that last Wednesday's monetary meeting between the chancellor and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, had decided to leave rates unchanged. For the first time in living memory, a UK government has acted to tighten monetary conditions while retail price inflation is low. A buoyant Mr Clarke said he decided to raise rates 'to take no risks with inflation' at a time of strong economic growth. His action was welcomed by financial markets. The pound jumped 1 1/2 pfennigs and more than a cent on the news before trading steadily for the rest of the day. On the Liffe futures exchange, the December long gilt future rose to 100 1/32 in late trading, up  27/32 points on the day. Even the equity market responded positively after an initial downward lurch. The FT-SE 100 index made up more than half an early 25-point loss to finish 10.5 points down at 3,128.8. Pledging to keep the recovery 'healthy and lasting', the chancellor said UK output was growing at its fastest rate for six years, with exports at record levels and investment rising. Underlying inflation, at 2.2 per cent in July, was at a 27-year low. 'My overriding aim now is to make sure that this healthy growth can be sustained to deliver higher living standards and more jobs. So often in the past, accelerating inflation has prevented us from enjoying sustained growth,' he said. 'We would have jeopardised everything if we had sat about in the face of these very strong figures and decided we were not going to act.' However, at a Treasury press conference, the chancellor admitted the rate rise was 'finely judged'. He and Mr George were 'poised' to raise rates after meeting last week but decided to take two days to reflect before the final decision, taken around Friday lunchtime. The decisive factor was last month's disclosure that the economy had been growing much faster than thought in the first half of the year. That overcame reservations based on more recent indicators hinting at a slowdown in consumer demand. Earlier yesterday, the Central Statistical Office published official producer price figures providing one of the first indications of pending inflationary pressures. The price of goods leaving factories rose last month in most manufacturing sectors. The rate rise - the first since October 1989, apart from a one-day jump on Black Wednesday in September 1992 - was welcomed by City analysts for injecting a new element of credibility into government economic policy. Business and trade union leaders were less happy. Mr Richard Brown, deputy director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said there was 'no justification' for the rise and warned it 'may sabotage' much of the recovery. Mr Graham Mackenzie, director-general of the Engineering Employers' Federation, said it was disappointing and risked 'stifling the recovery'. Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the Transport and General Workers' Union, said pay claims would reflect higher borrowing costs.

			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Is anybody out there?: An ambitious search for alien life On Monday, the 500th anniversary of the discovery of the New World by Christopher Columbus, the US space agency Nasa will start mankind's first systematic search for extra-terrestrial intelligence. Seti is a mainstream scientific enterprise, not to be confused with the fringe activities of UFO hunters. Most astronomers believe that intelligent life must be widespread elsewhere in the universe and that Seti has a fair chance of detecting its existence. Such a discovery could be the most significant scientific event in human history. The project will use the world's most powerful radio-telescopes, combined with computerised analysis, to search for artificial signals from alien life. On Monday afternoon, Nasa astronomer Jill Tarter will switch on the 300-metre dish at Arecibo in Puerto Rico at the same moment as her colleague Sam Gulkis activates the 34-metre antenna at Goldstone, California. Within a month the two antennae will have scanned the sky millions of times more thoroughly than all previous searches. The Seti story started in 1960 when Professor Frank Drake tuned his radio-telescope to a nearby star which, he thought, might have a planetary system capable of sustaining life. Since then, astronomers have carried out about 50 individual Seti projects and detected some intriguing signals, but no clear message from extra-terrestrial life. Seti supporters are not dismayed by their failure so far, because the methods used have been rudimentary compared with Nasa's new survey which uses microwaves - high frequency radio waves. Prof Drake, still the leading enthusiast, confidently expects an extra-terrestrial signal to be picked up within 10 years. John Billingham, head of the Seti office at Nasa's Ames Research Centre in California, says cautiously: 'It's not unreasonable to think we might detect something.' Sir Francis Graham-Smith of Britain's Jodrell Bank observatory, which has helped carry out preparatory research for Seti, is more doubtful. 'The odds are pretty heavily against hearing a real squeak,' he says. 'But I admire people who are prepared to dedicate so much of their lives to Seti.' Recent scientific discoveries support the view that the universe is full of life. Astronomers now believe billions of other stars have planets like our solar system. And simple organic molecules, similar to the chemical building blocks of terrestrial life, are distributed widely through interstellar space. 'Given enough time and favourable environmental conditions, biological complexity and intelligence may also have evolved in many locations,' says Bob Arnold of Nasa. 'If only one site in a thousand has developed intelligence and technology, there may now be about 10m advanced civilisations in our galaxy.' That may be a wild overestimate. Even so, few astronomers believe we are the only technologically advanced species in our galaxy. Of all the uncertainties involved in estimating the number of extra-terrestrial civilisations, the most uncertain is knowing how long they last on average. Is it a consequence of natural evolution that intelligent life tends to destroy itself through warfare and/or pollution, soon after it has mastered the technology to communicate across the galaxy? If so, there may be only a handful of civilisations in existence at any one time. On the other hand, if the universe really is teeming with advanced life, why have we not picked up its signals already? Possibly because the cleanest and more efficient medium of interstellar communication is not radio but something our primitive human minds have not yet thought of. But, with our present technology, searching by radio is the only practical option. Although Seti astronomers have no idea where in the sky to point their receivers, they can make an educated guess about the channels likely to be used for interstellar messages. The Nasa project is concentrating on the portion of the microwave spectrum which suffers least from natural background noise. Over the next 10 years, the scientists plan to use nine radio-telescopes around the globe to carry out two linked searches. The 'targeted search' will examine 1,000 individual stars within 100 light-years of earth, selected for their similarity to our sun. The 'sky survey' will scan the whole heavens, with a less sensitive resolution. Computers will process the radio output at a rate equivalent to millions of words per second. They are programmed to pick out any pattern not corresponding to signals from known astronomical processes or human communications. Man-made interference is a growing problem, as satellite and earth-based microwave transmissions steadily obliterate the channels chosen for Seti. 'Daily the task becomes more difficult,' Nasa says. If Nasa does detect an alien signal through the buzz of human communications it will follow the Seti code of conduct drawn up by the International Academy of Astronautics. There will be no public announcement until an international panel of scientists has verified the finding. What happens then depends on the nature of the signal. Most exciting would be a 'we are here' message, deliberately transmitted by an alien species trying to make contact with intelligent life elsewhere in the galaxy. It would presumably be based on universal mathematical or physical constants, for simple decoding. But if we were eavesdropping on signals transmitted for other purposes - for example the extra-terrestrial equivalent of the radio waves which have been leaking out from earth for the past 50 years from television broadcasts and radars - human scientists might not be able to extract any detailed information from them. Under the Seti code, no reply can be broadcast unless political leaders have agreed on its contents through the United Nations. One can imagine an impassioned debate, weighing the benefits of learning from more advanced creatures against the risks of alerting them to our existence. We would be insulated by an inbuilt time delay. Each message would take tens or hundreds of years to cross interstellar space, and it would take the aliens far longer than that physically to reach us unless they have learned to travel at the speed of light. Even so, the fate of the indigenous inhabitants of the New World after 1492 might provide an awful warning about the dangers of contact with a more advanced civilisation.</p>

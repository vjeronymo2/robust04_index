			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dobromir Zadgorski, chairman of Nationwide </F> Committee on Defense of National Interests, by Vanya Kamburova;  place and date not given]    [Text] [Kamburova] Mr.  Zadgorski, in the declaration of the Fatherland Party of Labor  [OPT] you expressed the opinion that you will appear in an  alliance with the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] in the next  elections also. How do you view the decisions of the 41st BSP  Congress in this context?    [Zadgorski] The 41st BSP Congress definitely took place in a  democratic spirit. There was a very constructive change at the  congress -- the rejuvenation of the Supreme Council and the  consolidation of the line according to which the BSP is led by  young people. The election of Zhan Videnov as party chairman  proves that the young cadres in the BSP are finding their place  in the party's front ranks ever more. The congress gave carte  blanche to the young members, and this is very good. We are  especially satisfied with the decision on the early elections  and the decision that denounces the Turkicization in the mixed  population regions.    [Kamburova] How do you forecast the next elections?    [Zadgorski] Some 200,000 voters are behind us. Our  organization is very strong in the six mixed regions. We have  very strong positions in Varna, Dobrich, Ruse, and Veliko  Turnovo. In Turnovo, for example, we have six city councillors.  I definitely think that the coalition will win the election,  and I will even take a risk and make a direct prophecy -- we  will be 10-15 percent ahead of the Union of Democratic Forces  [SDS]. We have a total of 90 municipal councillors in about 30  cities and three deputies in the National Assembly. We think  that our presence will grow after the new elections. I consider  it very important that the BSP supports our views regarding the  national interests. We are not allies in the literally sense of  this word. We only formed a preelection alliance, which gives  us the right to independence in adopting our decisions. We  worked and will continue to work in a collegial manner in the  parliament, and will continue to give priority to our national  interests.    [Kamburova] Is there democracy in adopting decisions in the  Parliamentary Union for Social Democracy [PSSD]?    [Zadgorski] Yes, the BSP does not impinge upon our right to  adopt independent decisions. Our contradictions were related  exclusively to issues regarding the cabinet of Professor Berov,  because it was formed with the mandate of the Movement for  Rights and Freedoms [DPS] -- a movement we do not recognize. We  consider it an anti-Bulgarian movement. We voted against the  government in all the no-confidence votes. We only supported  the Budget Bill, because we thought that our country needs it.  Those are no contradictions with our colleagues in the PSSD,  but only different views. In all other cases we were united --  for example, the Yakoruda case, the UN corridor, Bulgaria's  neutrality in the events in former Yugoslavia, and so forth.    [Kamburova] What difficulties does your party have in  regions with a mixed population?    [Zadgorski] They spring first of all from the local  administrative power, which is in the hands of the DPS. It does  everything possible to assert itself among people of Bulgarian  origin. Competent people are being fired and this is explained  by pseudo-national interests. Our categorical objection is in  this sphere. We also have problems with the "Dogan Law," but we  try to protect the Bulgarians even in this sphere, naturally,  without violating the interests of others.    [Kamburova] What is the influence of the DPS in those  regions at the present moment?    [Zadgorski] The influence of the DPS in those regions is  decreasing in a catastrophic manner. Even if the present  Election Law with its 4 percent barrier remains, I think that  they will have serious difficulties. The false nature of the  interests of this movement's leaders was already grasped by the  population. Some voted "with their feet," and left for Turkey.  Others are bitterly disappointed, and they will not support the  DPS. Yet others have lost their confidence and they will simply  not vote.</p>

			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: When confusion reigns - Personal pensions, last in the series on the true costs of investing Good investment performance will always compensate for high charges - but if investment performance falls, you are left with the high charges. These can have a dramatic effect on how much your personal pension plan produces when you cash it in. Although charges on such plans usually are stated explicitly in the product brochure, working out their implications is almost impossible. This confusion is made worse by the fact that while new rules on life insurance disclosure come into force at the end of this year, all personal pension providers (mostly insurance companies) must until then quote an identical set of charges laid down by the regulator. It is, therefore, impossible to tell which companies have high charges and which are particularly competitive. To make matters even worse, the standard set of charges is now so dated that virtually all of the 100-plus providers have higher fees than the standard. Personal pension plan charges come in a variety of guises and disguises, from the relatively straightforward to the frankly incomprehensible. They include: Bid/offer spread As with most shares quoted on the stock exchange, this reflects the difference between the buying and selling prices, and is usually 5 per cent plus a rounding charge. Annual fund charge All funds have an annual management charge, the norm being 1 per cent but varying from nil on cash funds to 1.75 per cent a year for highly specialised funds. Several companies return part of this fee at retirement, re-labelled as a 'loyalty bonus.' Policy fee, service or administrative charge These fees are charged for collecting contributions. They usually start at an innocuous level of about Pounds 2 a month, but nearly all are linked to an index and will rise in line with its increases. Most link to the index of national average earnings, which rises more rapidly than the alternative, the retail price index. Obviously, the smaller the contribution, the bigger the slice the policy fee will represent. Even for single contributions (for example, a lump sum transfer from another scheme), some companies still levy an administration charge, deducted monthly by cancellation of units or as a single deduction at outset of about Pounds 100. Unit allocation This is the percentage of the contribution actually invested in units. The rate will vary enormously between the providers, how often contributions are paid, and how far you are from retirement. Unit allocations are always higher for lump sum contributions than annual: the lowest are for monthly contributions. Do not be fooled by companies that tell you the allocation is, for example, 102 per cent of what you pay. Although it sounds good, it simply means the charges are being deducted elsewhere. Unit allocations can be as little as 50 per cent of the first year's contributions. But some smaller life companies, which sell pensions entirely through their own sales forces, can have a unit allocation of zero for the first two years. Capital levy This is the most obscure and, frankly, the most misleading of all charges levied on personal pensions. It is an old-fashioned method of taking out up-front charges and is used simply to disguise this fact. Life offices that operate this system will have two types of unit, capital and accumulation. For the first one or two years, contributions will be allocated to capital units which bear an additional annual charge throughout the lifetime of the pension plan. Capital units do not apply to lump sum contributions. By operating this system, the brochure (or the salesman) will be able to say that 100 per cent of contributions are invested from day one. Clearly, this is better from their point of view than saying that half or all of your first year's contributions are swallowed up in charges. The capital unit method disguises this completely. The sting in the tail Watch out for 'hidden' charges that may not be apparent from the brochure or the salesman. These are penalties levied if you cancel your policy in the early years. This charge can be swingeing - General Portfolio, for example, has a nil value on its personal pension if you cancel in the first five years. To show the effect of charges, we have taken a Pounds 10,000 single contribution. If it were to grow at 10 per cent a year without any charges deducted, it would be worth Pounds 25,937 after 10 years. The average charging policy would deduct a total of Pounds 3,557 but the highest charging plan - that of Royal London - would deduct Pounds 4,846, which is almost 19 per cent of the fund value. It is impossible for the layman to work out the effect of all these complex charges, but there are two ways of avoiding the most onerous. You can pay by single contributions or recurring single contributions; or pay an independent adviser a fee, thus ensuring that the commission part of the charges is re-invested in the pension plan. In the example given above, the most competitive personal pension plan with no commission deducted is from Provident Life. Its charges amount to a deduction of Pounds 1,774 over 10 years, or 6.8 per cent of the total. But do not forget that the cost of the fee, and lost interest on that, has to be taken into account.

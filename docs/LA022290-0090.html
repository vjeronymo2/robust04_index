			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.B. COUNCIL COMPROMISES ON DATA FROM POLICE SUITS  </P> <P> The City Council reversed itself this week and agreed to provide the Public  Safety Advisory Commission with part of the information it had requested on  money paid out in police-related lawsuits over the last three years.  </P> <P> The council decided not to provide the requested case-by-case breakdown but  compromised by agreeing to send information on settlements and judgments  involving all city departments, including police, when amounts exceed $25,000.  </P> <P> That translates to less than 15 cases a year for the city, including police,  city attorneys said.  </P> <P> The city has about 500 personal-injury lawsuits pending at any one time, with  20% to 25% of those likely to result in settlements, Assistant City Atty.  Robert E. Shannon said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Long Beach wins most lawsuits filed against it, Shannon said. An estimated 20%  to 25% of them involve the police, according to City Atty. John R. Calhoun.  </P> <P> Not everyone involved in the controversy over compiling the information  embraced the compromise, which was proposed by Calhoun and Councilman Tom  Clark.  </P> <P> For commissioners, who had hoped that such information would help them spot  patterns and problem areas, the compromise was far from what was requested. The  panel wanted a list of all police-related settlements and judgments.  </P> <P> Commission members echoed concerns of other community leaders, who criticized  the council for secretly settling a $330,000 police brutality lawsuit in  December. While council members denied trying to hide the settlement, they  nonetheless agreed two months ago to note publicly any final settlement  approved in closed sessions.  </P> <P> "We did ask for much more than what you seem agreeable to providing,"  Commissioner Barbara Shoag told the council before its Tuesday vote.  </P> <P> Fred Kugler, a spokesman for Long Beach Area Citizens Involved, said: "I think  it's the best we could get out of the council."  </P> <P> "The public will now have a better idea of the nature of settlements, but in  terms of evaluating trends, the information won't be adequate," he said after  the meeting.  </P> <P> The compromise also failed to satisfy members of the council, who last week  denied the request for information on the grounds that it would take too much  time and cost too much for city staff members to compile.  </P> <P> The information, they said, is available to anyone willing to do the legwork to  dig it up and would not provide clear evidence of patterns, because settlements  do not always mean someone did something wrong.  </P> <P> "The ability to categorize or come up with patterns is next to impossible,"  Councilwoman Jan Hall said.  </P> <P> Hall said that the commission will look for trends by reviewing about 45 cases  and that just some of those will involve police.  </P> <P> "I think that's crazy," Hall said. "I don't think that makes sense."  </P> <P> Councilman Jeff Kellogg agreed with Hall, and both voted against ordering city  staff to compile the data. Joining Clark -- the only councilman who supported  the commission's request last week -- were Councilmen Evan Anderson Braude,  Wallace Edgerton, Ray Grabinski, Warren Harwood, Les Robbins and Clarence  Smith.  </P> <P> But most of the councilmen said they were changing their votes not because they  support the compromise but because of the public outcry that their vote  generated last week.  </P> <P> Community leaders were outraged that the council had refused to help the  commission gather the data. Although council members insisted that the  information is public and available to anyone, commissioners said they have  neither the resources nor the knowledge to gather the information themselves.  </P> <P> In essence, they said, the council's refusal to help was tantamount to denying  them the information.  </P> <P> Council members repeated Tuesday that they are not trying to hide any  settlement. Nonetheless, the majority changed its vote to appease critics.  </P> <P> "Once again, the council will take a position based on newspaper reaction,"  said Edgerton, referring to an editorial in the Press-Telegram that criticized  the council for its original vote.  </P> <P> In casting his vote, Harwood alluded to the upcoming election and said the  Public Safety Advisory Commission is taking advantage of the "political  season." Four of the nine council members face re-election. Harwood and  Grabinski are unopposed.  </P> <P> "The council is being put in a squeeze," with the impression that to deny the  commission's request is the same as denying access to public records, Harwood  said.  </P> <P> He questioned whether this would set a precedent that would encourage other  commissions and committees to ask the city to compile other information, such  as: "How many homes have tile roofs?" Harwood said.  </P> <P> Grabinski, who was strongly opposed to the commission's request, voted for the  compromise, but even as he announced his vote he added: "I hope it doesn't  pass."  </P> <P> Last week, council members said they feared that the commission would  second-guess their decisions. The council, on the advice of the city's  attorneys, makes final decisions on what cases to settle out of court and for  what amounts.  </P> <P> At the time, community activists called the council's refusal to help the  commission gather the information "atrocious" and "the supreme insult to the  constituents."  </P></p>

			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Gardening: A beautiful but neglected plant A FEW years ago most of my bamboos flowered and then died. To be more accurate, I presume they flowered, for I know of no other cause for their sudden extinction and, bamboos often - though not invariably - die after producing flowers. But their flowers are small and I did not notice them. I was only aware of trouble when the plants began to fail. Now comes a fine book, Bamboos (Batsford Pounds 19.99) by Christine Recht, with fine colour photographs by Max F Wetterwald, to throw light on these beautiful but neglected plants. It arrives directly after another book, written and admirably illustrated by Graham Stuart Thomas, entitled Ornamental Shrubs, Climbers and Bamboos (Pounds 25, John Murray), an excellent encyclopedia. But Rechts' book clearly has scope to deal with just one subject in greater detail. Do not expect them to agree altogether on names for the genera and species, because accurate identification depends largely on flowers and bamboos flower very irregularly - sometimes not even once in 100 years  - so it is difficult for botanists to obtain material to confirm their studies. This need not deter anyone from planting bamboos which are, in general, beautiful and easily grown plants, some of which are small enough to be planted in tiny gardens or in containers. Recht has a lot to say about the cultivation of bamboos, which are happiest in moist soil and semi-shady places. A goodly number of species and garden varieties will be found in nurseries and sources of supply can be traced via The Plant Finder, a book which makes things easy for gardeners. It is not always understood that bamboos are related to grasses. They are the tree and shrub members of the enormous grass family. They are all evergreen. They spread, sometimes rather too freely for comfort, by creeping roots known as rhizomes but can be fairly easily restricted by chopping them back with a sharp spade. Detached portions of the root can be replanted elsewhere if desired. Nearly all the wild bamboos come from Asia. In Chinese art bamboos represent the male element - the yang - in contrast to the softer female element - the ying - of flowers such as the chrysanthemum or plum blossom, two favourites with the Chinese. These are all matters that are dealt with in detail by Recht. Both text and illustrations give many ideas for planting. When grown in containers they need a good rich soil, a John Innes type of mixture rather than peat, unless they are fed regularly and generously. Most plants are sold in containers from which they can be moved at any time of year. Recht recommends spring planting because new root growth is strong and the plants can become well established by midsummer. Spring is also the best time for plants moved from open ground, whether from nursery to garden, or from one part of the garden to another. Any newly transplanted plants must not be allowed to suffer for lack of water. Bamboos make a lot of leaves and are thirsty plants. Bamboos differ in size, leaf shape and the pattern and colour of their canes. There are varieties with variegated leaves, such as golden striped Pleioblastus viridistriatus or silver striped P. fortunei, and there also kinds with coloured canes, such as Sinarundinaria nitida, in which the canes are deep, purplish grey. I have nothing but praise for Bamboos - except for the proof reading which seems to have been done by a machine, checking spelling but not able to consider the meaning of a sentence. There are, of course, no such shortcomings with Graham Thomas's book, for he is too meticulous an author to allow anything like this to happen. His is a volume of 585 pages giving a comprehensive account of hardy and nearly hardy shrubs and climbing plants - and a very adequate one of bamboos. It is clearly organised and should have a prominent place in the libraries of gardeners. His illustrations are from his own photographs, flower paintings and line drawings - a marvel to consider for Christmas. Either book would make a handsome gift for any keen gardener.</p>

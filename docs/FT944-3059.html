			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Toyota hit by falling demand Weaker-than-expected demand for new cars in Europe means Toyota will not use the full capacity of 100,000 cars a year at its Burnaston plant near Derby next year, contrary to plan, the company said yesterday. It now plans to produce 90,000 cars next year, compared with a projected 85,000 this year. 'However, as we have seen this year, which started strongly but then slowed more recently, the market is very changeable and our production levels next year may be amended accordingly,' said Mr Yukihisa Hirano, managing director of Toyota UK. Toyota's announcement, the failure of Nissan this year to meet earlier output projections for its plant at Washington, Tyne and Wear, and relatively slow growth in output of Honda's production plant at Swindon in Wiltshire indicate that other European carmakers' fears about sales of cars from Japanese 'transplants' may have been over-stated. Nissan is expected to produce about 200,000 cars this year, compared with earlier forecasts of 230,000 to 240,000. Honda, which is preparing production of a second car at a 100,000 units-a-year capacity plant at Swindon, built 29,300 Accord models in the first nine months of this year. Mr Hirano rejected speculation that Toyota has decided to delay outline plans to double capacity at Burnaston. 'As we have said from the outset, we will monitor the market as it develops to determine when to move to phase two and 200,000 cars a year,' he said</p>

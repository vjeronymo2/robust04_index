			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 12 PUNISHED FOR VIOLATING LIQUOR RULES;  </P> <P> CULTURE: THE MOVE REFLECTS A U.S. DESIRE TO AVOID INSULTING SAUDIS.  </P> <P> Stringently enforcing a no-booze policy, military authorities have imposed  heavy fines on 12 American servicemen and are considering more severe action  against a dozen others found drunk or in possession of alcohol in this legally  dry kingdom.  </P> <P> The actions under military law make clear the determination of American  commanders to enforce round-the-clock abstinence from alcohol -- unprecedented  in a U.S. combat theater -- even though it is a source of friction with troops,  according to U.S. officials.  </P> <P> Among the Americans reprimanded and ordered to forfeit "substantial" wages were  an Air Force major and a captain, the officials said. Both were held in  violation of General Order No. 1, the stern teetotaling order issued at the  outset of the U.S. buildup here.  </P> <P> Although alcohol is officially prohibited in Saudi Arabia, it is by no means  unknown. Saudi authorities have long turned a blind eye to Western residents'  home-based manufacture of beer, wine and distilled liquor for personal  consumption.  </P> <P> But in barring alcohol even from closed U.S. military compounds, the American  commander here, Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, decided that the United States  should adopt a strict prohibition in deference to Saudi sensitivities,  according to officials familiar with his thinking.  </P> <P> The officials said Schwarzkopf regards the prohibition and other strict curbs  on soldiers' conduct as the kind of test that the U.S. military may face with  increasing frequency as its focus shifts from Europe to the Middle East and the  Third World.  </P> <P> The no-drinking rule has prompted vocal discontent among soldiers, many of whom  have told visitors that their desert duty would be far more tolerable if they  were permitted an occasional drink, as were GIs in World War II, Korea and  Vietnam.  </P> <P> "How long can the Army expect a soldier to last without his beer?" an infantry  lieutenant complained in an interview last week.  </P> <P> The disclosure of the disciplinary actions, however, marks the first indication  that American soldiers had been found in violation of the ban.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the U.S. Central Command confirmed this week that "disciplinary  action" had been taken against 12 servicemen for violation of the alcohol  prohibition. In all cases, he said, penalties were imposed through a procedure  for non-judicial punishment that stops short of a formal court-martial.  </P> <P> Such punishment can include forfeiture of pay, formal reprimands, extra duty  and, for enlisted men, reduction in rank. The spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. David Knox,  declined to specify what action had been taken.  </P> <P> Other informed U.S. sources, however, said the penalties included heavy  forfeitures of pay for officers and the loss of rank for at least one enlisted  man.  </P> <P> Some of the soldiers who violated the rule apparently were seeking to  manufacture moonshine for their own use, the sources said. Others apparently  smuggled alcohol into the country through the mail or military planes, or were  able to buy liquor in local markets.  </P> <P> One knowledgeable American official said that the stocks of bootleg alcohol  available in northern Saudi Arabia have swollen in recent weeks as Iraqi  soldiers, in clandestine visits to Saudi outposts, offer alcohol in trade for  food and other supplies. A Saudi official, however, said he heard no such  reports.  </P> <P> The Central Command's General Order No. 1 specifically "prohibits the  introduction, possession, use, sale, transfer, manufacture or consumption of  any alcoholic beverage" by military personnel and civilians serving with U.S.  armed forces in Operation Desert Shield.  </P> <P> It provides an exemption, however, for thousands of American servicemen  deployed to bases in the region outside Saudi Arabia, where local law permits  alcohol to be consumed.  </P></p>

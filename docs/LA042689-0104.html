			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ATTORNEY APPOINTED FOR MURDER VICTIM'S DAUGHTER  </P> <P> A Mission Viejo woman arrested last weekend on suspicion of hiring three people  to kill her father appeared in Orange County Municipal Court in Laguna Niguel  on Tuesday to have a lawyer appointed.  </P> <P> Municipal Judge Blair T. Barnette appointed Orange County lawyer Jack M. Earley  to represent Deborah Ann Werner, 40, who, along with her three co-defendants,  is being held without bail in Orange County Jail in connection with the death  of her father, David Werner, 72, a retired stockbroker.  </P> <P> The victim was discovered in his Mission Viejo bedroom at 1 a.m. April 16, with  a knife plunged through his neck, Orange County Sheriff's Department officials  said. An autopsy showed that Werner had been smothered before he was stabbed.  </P> <P> Deborah Werner was arrested Saturday, a week after she had called police to  report finding her father's body. Investigators said they found inconsistencies  in her story.  </P> <P> She is charged with hiring Carrie Mae Chidester, 20, of Huntington Beach;  Charles L. Clemmons, 20, of Anaheim, and Miguel Ruiz, 21, of Garden Grove to  kill her father so she could collect on "several hundred thousand dollars" from  his inheritance, sheriff's officials have said. The three co-defendants were  also arrested last weekend and booked into the jail without bond.  </P> <P> All four were due to be arraigned Tuesday, but only Werner, Chidester and  Clemmons appeared in court. Court officials said Ruiz had refused to appear.  Barnette continued the arraignment until May 5 after also appointing attorneys  for Chidester and Clemmons.  </P></p>

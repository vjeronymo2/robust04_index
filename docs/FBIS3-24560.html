			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by L.V. Vishnyakova and V.I. Kukhtenko (GosNIIAS, </F> Moscow) under the ``Complex Technical Systems'' rubric]    [Abstract] The first stage of a system for computer aided  design of short range (5 to 25 km) anti-aircraft missile  complexes (AMCs) is described. The system methodology is based  on using the body of mathematics of the theory of operations in  conjunction with the automatic control theory the theory of  large systems. The problem of developing a short range AMC is  stated and solved for the developmental design proposal stage.  The process of computer aided design of an anti-aircraft complex  includes sequential solution of problems of synthesizing the AMC  image and analysis of resulting AMC configurations. The article  describes the structure of the CAD system, as well as its  hardware and software. The software for simulation of the AMC  and its major subsystems is also described in great detail. The  AMC CAD system was used for a number of practical calculations  investigating the prospects for development and analysis of  effectiveness of various configurations of a short range AMC.  The use of the AMC CAD system made it possible to substantially  increase the number of alternative AMC versions analyzed during  the development process, which improved the quality of the  design output. The system can be used by a research engineer who  does not know programming languages but knows AMC design methods  and procedures. Figures 13, references 23.</p>

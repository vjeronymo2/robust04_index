			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family (Briefcase): Benificiaries as executors MY WIFE and I are contemplating new wills to replace those we made 12 years ago. On the last occasion we had but recently returned to a town where we had lived for many years so when the solicitor asked about my executors, we said that we had no one in mind. He asked us, therefore, about nominating members of his staff, something to which we then agreed, not realising the hourly rates that would be levied for this service. Is it now possible to appoint a beneficiary under the will as executor or executrix? Would only one executor or executrix suffice, or must there be more than one? What is the exact responsibility of such a nominee? Is it to ensure that the wishes of the deceased as set out in the will are in fact faithfully carried out and to see that the solicitor secures probate as quickly as possible, thus ensuring that the bequests are made with a minimum of delay? I see no problem in your appointing a beneficiary in your will as an executor or executrix. One executor would suffice but I suggest that you have two, in case one dies prematurely. The executor's duties would include obtaining probate at the earliest opportunity and ensuring that the estate is devolved in accordance with your wishes. It is normal to have a professional as an executor or executrix so that he or she can advise on the legal formalities. However, there is nothing wrong with your appointing non-professionals who can then seek professional advice where appropriate.

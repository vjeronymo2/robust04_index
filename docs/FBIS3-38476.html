			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Klaus Wittmann report: "Plutonium Fuel Rods"] </F>   [Text] Gundremmingen -- For the first time worldwide,  mixed oxide (MOX) fuel elements are permitted for use in a  boiling water reactor. After a year-long controversy over the  authorization, this was decided by the Bavarian Health Ministry  yesterday. In first statements, the Bavarian Greens and the  "Alliance for Protection From MOX" talked of a "disastrous false  decision."    It is an alarming world premiere and completely  incomprehensible that Germany is the trailblazer with this  nonsense, Deputy Raimund Kamm from the Greens said. In the  course of the authorization proceedings, even the International  Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna objected to the use of MOX fuel  elements in boiling water reactors. Such reactors only have one  cooling cycle.    However, Bavarian Environment Minister Peter Gauweiler  thinks  that the objections are unfounded. An international safety  analysis has shown that it can be safely used, he said. More  than 40,000 people had objected to the use of MOX and there had  been fierce controversies in the hearing in February 1993. The  people who made objections complained about the vexatious  transaction of the proceedings.</p>

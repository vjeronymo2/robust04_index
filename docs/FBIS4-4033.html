			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 27 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic  People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) has invited inspectors from  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to observe the  replacement of fuel rods at the Yongbyon reactor, a DPRK Foreign  Ministry spokesman said today.    The spokesman told reporters that the DPRK would fully  guarantee access for the inspectors and turn over the replaced  fuel rods to the IAEA for examination to ensure the continuity  of nuclear safety.    The spokesman also said he hopes the United States and the  IAEA would respect DPRK's status regarding the nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty and adopt just standpoints and attitudes.    He added if the United States and the IAEA impose the  further  inspections,the situation will become more complicated.    The IAEA has said it will observe the replacement of fuel  rods during this "additional inspection", reports said.</p>

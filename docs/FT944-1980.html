			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Bitter Tories argue over poll blame The Conservative party was locked in bitter recriminations over the Dudley West by-election yesterday as senior ministers and disaffected rightwing backbenchers disputed the blame for the Tory candidate's disastrous performance. Amid Labour jubilation at the unexpectedly big swing of 29 per cent against the government, Mr John Major described the vote as a 'very poor result' and issued an urgent call for party unity. He said: 'I think some good can come out of it, providing people realise within the Conservative party that we are all pulling in the same direction for the same cause at the same time and against the same opponent.' Rebel rightwingers blamed the defeat on the prime minister's unwillingness to bow to demands for a shift to the right on crucial issues such as Europe, taxation and public spending. Mr John Wilkinson, one of nine MPs suspended from the parliamentary party, said the Tories faced a 'wipe-out' on the scale of the Canadian Progressive Conservative party, which lost power and all but two seats last year. Mrs Teresa Gorman, another suspended rebel, said: 'Our supporters stayed at home because they think the policies we are pursuing are not in their best interests.' Mr John Townend, the rightwing chairman of the Conservative backbench finance committee, called for tight spending controls and tax cuts. 'We have to return to basic Conservative polices,' he said. Mr Jeremy Hanley, the party chairman, sought to calm the storm by forecasting continued economic recovery. He told MPs: 'We have to stick to our guns to make sure individuals feel the benefits of that in the coming two . . . years.' Mr Graham Bright, Mr Major's former parliamentary private secretary, told BBC Radio that 'a divided party is never a party that gets a lot of support'. The bickering prompted a warning from Sir Norman Fowler, a former Conservative chairman. He wrote in the London Evening Standard that voters 'fear the party has a political death wish'. He added: 'Conservatives should be absolutely clear what this means. If we go on like this then we will make a gift-wrapped present of the next general election to the Labour party.' Mr Anthony Coombs, the Conservative MP who ran the party's campaign, blamed Tory in-fighting for the disaster. He said: 'If you have the kind of things happening like the last two weeks you are damaged accordingly. Unity is very important.' Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, said the victory demonstrated the need for further modernisation of his party to consolidate support from the centre ground of politics. He said: 'The agenda for the 1980s may have run its course but people want an agenda for the 1990s. They don't want to move the clock back.' He plans to demonstrate soon that his modernising faction reflects the mainstream views of party members. Stranded by a Labour tide, Page 9</p>

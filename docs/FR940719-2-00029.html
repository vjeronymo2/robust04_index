The action is proposed in response to an application seeking legal access to approximately 885 acres of non-Federal land located within the Forest Boundary on the Cle Elum Ranger District. The proposed action is located approximately 8 miles south of Cle Elum, Washington. The purpose of the EIS will be to develop and evaluate a range of alternatives including a no action Alternative, and possible additional alternatives to respond to issues identified during the scoping process. The proposed project will be in compliance with the direction in the Wenatchee National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (March 1990) which provides the overall guidance for management of the area. The agency invites written comments on the scope of this project. In addition, the agency gives notice of this analysis so that interested and affected people are aware of how they may participate and contribute to the final decision. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments concerning the scope of this proposal must be received by June 10, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Submit written comments and suggestions to Sonny J.

The applicant requests a right-of-way across NFS lands for the purpose of establishing temporary legal access to approximately 885 acres in one section of land owned by the applicant. The section of land to be accessed is surrounded by NFS lands and no legal road access to the section currently exists. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The applicant seeks legal access pursuant to the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA). The ANILCA directs the Forest Service to grant access to inholdings of non-Federal land within the National Forest boundary for the reasonable use and enjoyment of those lands by the landowner. The applicant has stated that it intends to manage the lands to be accessed for long term timber production utilizing conventional ground based logging systems. The applicant intends to build a road on the permitted right-of-way sufficient to support the intended use of the land. The access involves approximately 2,642 of existing road and 2,480 feet of new road on 2 acres of NFS land. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A range of alternatives will be considered, including a no action alternative. Other alternatives will be developed in response to issues received during scoping. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The major issues that have been identified to date include the following: Water quality; Late Successional Reserves; habitat for spotted owl, peregrine falcon and the gray wolf; cumulative effects of both the road access and the management of the private land and Forest Service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public participation will be especially important at several points during the analysis. The Forest Service will be seeking information, comments, and assistance from Federal, State, and local agencies, and other individuals or organizations who may be interested in or affected by the proposed actions. This information will be used in preparation of the draft EIS. The scoping process includes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Identifying potential issues. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Identifying issues to be analyzed in depth. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Eliminating insignificant issues or those which have been covered by a relevant previous environmental process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Exploring additional alternatives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Identifying potential environmental effects of the proposed action and alternatives (i.e. direct, indirect, and cumulative effects and connected actions). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Determining potential cooperating agencies and task assignments. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The draft EIS is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and to be available for public review by January 31, 1995. At that time, copies of the draft EIS will be distributed to interested and affected agencies, organizations, and members of the public for their review and comment. EPA will publish a notice of availability of the draft EIS in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comment period on the draft EIS will be no less than 45 days from the date the EPA notice appears in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . It is very important that those interested in the management of the Wenatchee National Forest participate at that time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft EIS's must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NRDC,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the draft EIS stage but that are not raised until after completion of the final EIS may be waived or dismissed by the courts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> City of Angoon  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hodel,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 803 F. 2d 1016, 1022 (9th Cir. 1986) and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Wisconsin Heritages, Inc.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Harris,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested in this proposed action participate by the close of the comment period so that substantive comments and objections are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final EIS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments on the draft EIS should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer to specific pages or chapters of the draft EIS. Comments may also address the adequacy of the draft EIS or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. Reviewers may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final EIS is scheduled to be completed by May 1, 1995. In the final EIS, The Forest Service is required to respond to comments and responses received during the comment period that pertain to the environmental consequences discussed in the draft EIS and applicable laws, regulations, and policies considered in making the decision regarding this proposal. Sonny J. O'Neal, Forest Supervisor, Wenatchee National Forest is the responsible official. As the responsible official he will document the decision and reasons for the decision in the Record of Decision. That decision will be subject to Forest Service appeal regulations (36 CFR 215). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: May 10, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Sonny J.

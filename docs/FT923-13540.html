			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Canary Wharf plan sparks strike STRIKE action by civil servants protesting over government plans to move them from Westminster to Canary Wharf may close two government departments on Wednesday. Staff at the environment and transport departments oppose the planned move because it would mean extra travelling and disruption for a workforce already under pressure from staff cuts, unions say. The strike, by members of the CPSA and NUCPS Civil Service unions, which represent junior and middle-ranking staff, is timed to coincide with a lobby of parliament. The FDA and IPMS, which together represent senior and specialist staff, are expected to support the lobby.</p>

			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Construction groups to lobby with one voice The formation of a powerful trade association to act as a single voice in Whitehall and Brussels for a large part of the UK construction industry was announced yesterday. The move is in line with a drive by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to reduce the number of trade associations with access to civil servants and ministers by restricting contact to a smaller number of 'lead asso-ciations'. The establishment of an umbrella body to represent the industry was supported by two of its largest employer organisations, the Building Employers Confederation and the Federation of Civil Engineering Employers, and by Major Construction Groups, which represents 11 of the country's largest contractors. It is hoped that other trade organisations and professional bodies will eventually support the initiative. The sector, with sales of about Pounds 50bn a year, is one of Britain biggest industries, contributing up to a tenth of gross domestic product. It is represented by several lobby groups which look after the diverse interests of quantity surveyors, architects, building-material producers and large international contractors. This has led to duplication of effort and in some cases has caused confusion among ministers and civil servants who have been listening to conflicting messages. The new body - given the working title Newco - will be expected to provide a focal voice for the industry's lobbying efforts and to lead industry thinking on strategic issues. It will continue to recognise the independence of member organisations such as the BEC and FCEC. PA Consulting Group has been appointed to draw up a series of aims and objectives for the trade association. Its report is due by late summer 'with the intention of establishing the new organisation before the end of the year'. Mr Heseltine has said that where lead trade associations emerged he would expect officials to 'refer to me only proposals from that lead association'.</p>

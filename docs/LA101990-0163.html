			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SPARKLE, GLAMOUR SEIZE FASHION SHOW SPOTLIGHT  </P> <P> Glittery Gala  </P> <P> For starters, the invitations shed silver glitter. Onto your clothes, your  hands, your lap. Onto everything. Maybe that's what party planners wanted when  they whipped up the invites to the Huntington Harbour Cancer League's annual  fashion show fund-raiser -- a little sparkle in the night, for so many nights  to come.  </P> <P> The theme of the benefit was "treasures" -- the shiny kind that spill from  buried chests, the kind hunted by pirates. After cocktails and silent auction  bidding Saturday, 500 guests sat transfixed in the Disneyland Hotel's grand  ballroom as a swashbuckling crew of models scampered up and down a runway like  shipwrecked explorers on a pristine beach.  </P> <P> The Pirates of PCH  </P> <P> The fast-paced fashion show -- complete with sets, music and lip-synching  professional dancers -- was produced by Carlton Burnett, with clothes chosen by  Kitty Leslie, fashion coordinator of Newport Center Fashion Island. Models were  picked from among Huntington Harbourites -- 16 women on the basis of style and  skill, five men by membership vote.  </P> <P> Why the discrepancy?  </P> <P> "Well, I doubt that very many men would actually try out," said event  chairwoman Sue Madison, laughing. "It's just a fun thing -- it's kind of like a  reward."  </P> <P> Out they came, in casual togs and business clothes and evening wear -- the  women with wide smiles and jaunty steps, the men with sheepish grins that said,  Am I really doing this?  </P> <P> Net Treasures  </P> <P> The party raised about $150,000, according to league president Phil Lupton,  bringing the Huntington Harbour group's fund-raising efforts for the American  Cancer Society's Orange County unit up over the $1 million mark. Funds will be  used locally for cancer research, education and patient care, Lupton said.  </P> <P> Faces  </P> <P> Committee members included Marilyn Bohle, Barbara Snegg, Ellen Goodwin, Missy  Prowell, Jean Zimmerman, Jeanie Barnett, Jenny Huntsinger, Sally Fenton and  Emmeline Vasquez.  </P> <P> Among sponsors were Kay and Jim Burra, Bobbitt and Bill Williams, Linda and Ted  Cohen, Phyllis and Dix Helland, Mary Ellen and Bob Houseal, and Helen La Bayne.  </P> <P> Quote  </P> <P> Backstage is chaos," said Barnett, who modeled five outfits, including a black,  backless hot-pants number that was quite popular with the male dinner guests.  "You have to be really careful with the clothes and you have to get in and out  of them really fast -- so you just pray you don't tear anything. Or go out  there unzipped!" PAMELA MARIN  </P></p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (20): An evergreen chartist with an eye for healthy growth - Serious riches / Christmas is a year-round business for John St George Syms, who runs the family tree plantation.  And so, too, is investment - mainly in equities it's a year-round business for Mr John St George Syms. Mr Syms, a 79-year-old, who spent his career balancing the very different pressures of the Bar and a country farm, is also a founder of the UK Christmas Tree Growers Association, and its second chairman. He provides the Christmas tree for Number 10, Downing Street each year. Initially, he had hoped to set up a competition, modelled on a similar scheme in the US where different growers compete to provide the White House tree. But now Mr Syms he finds that his peers are happy to leave the responsibility to him, so it has become an annual job. As the photograph on this page, taken last month, confirms, shows, Christmas trees grow around the year, and Mr Syms still pays there is still close attention to his plantation, situated on the edge of the estate, to the south of London. This estate has itself been the subject of a number of legal transactions, starting in 1967. Mr Syms passed the estate on to his son by his first wife (he is now married for the second time). This was not as radical a measure as it sounds, because he has retained a life interest - 'He can't get rid of me until I'm 92, so I'm pretty secure.' In many ways, Mr Syms' his life has revolved around the family estate, which his father bought in 1921. He bought the neighbouring estate, twice as large as the estate he inherited, in 1953, and it has since grown more or less in his own image. Thus there are fishing lakes (which several years ago he sold to his son) and also the Christmas trees. This business grew up almost by accident. Mr Syms' father started the plantation fairly unscientifically. Then a traveller asked to buy some trees for Christmas. One of his father's clients, an American businessman, then gave him some advice that he has never forgotten: 'When you grow older, you will realise it will pay you to employ someone else to do that work you are doing.' The business is still growing, and an extra five to ten acres is planted each year. Tending the plantation is a full-time job, now in the hands of Mr Syms' son, Mark. Investment is, similarly, a year-round job requiring diligent attention. While Mr Syms has always enlisted the advice of brokers, he also leans heavily on investment research. In his own words, he is an avowed chartist. The particular charts that he has consulted for more than two decades now are produced by Investment Research, of Cambridge. They indicate the performance of both general sectors and specific shares relative to their appropriate index. For a chart to tell Mr Syms to buy, in broad terms, it needs to have started to outperform its index. Wait too long and the opportunity may be lost, he believes. Having consulted the runes of the chart, Mr Syms will pick up the phone and consult his stockbroker, who is Neil Pedley, of James Capel. This is an 'advisory' relationship, which means that Mr Pedley is within his rights to try to argue Mr Syms out of a stock selection. He can also telephone with good ideas of his own. But he does not have discretion to make transactions unless specifically authorised. However, it is a mark of the respect between the two men that Mr Pedley does have discretion to make sales when he sees fit, and to give advice. 'When the crash came in 1987, I bailed out of everything,' recalls Mr Syms. 'I'm not saying I was right. Then, after two years, I decided it was time I got reinvested again.' He spent a year in gilts during 1989, and then took the decision to buy shares again. By now, he was out of contact with the City, so he turned for advice to his accountant, who recommended Mr Pedley. 'We don't have a stereotyped arrangement,' explains Mr Syms. 'I subscribe to Investment Research, so every now and then, if I see something I like, I tell him to buy it. We talk on the telephone about two or three times a week.' Equities now make up 90 per cent of his portfolio, with 10 per cent in cash. He no longer holds any gilts. This tends to suggest that age has not coloured his investment outlook with too much conservatism. A look through the individual shares in his portfolio further bears this out. For example, one of his strongest performers is Eurodisney. However, the bedrock of the portfolio is in solid stocks. 'I would say about 50 per cent of my stocks are in the FT-SE 100. I try to avoid speculation.' If he does want to speculate, he uses traded options. While Mr Syms' standard holding in a company is Pounds 7,500, he only risks Pounds 1,500 when putting money into options. He had already developed a taste for this form of investment from previous successful forays into commodity futures. One of his most recent choices shows a gambler's instinct, both for making the right choice and for quitting while he was ahead. He bought a call option in Midland Bank for June. This was an execution-only deal  - Mr Pedley could not advise him on it, because James Capel is owned By Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank. As Mr Syms puts it: 'For a period of time, it was 50 per cent down. Then I checked, and it had had an enormous rise. I rang up and said to take the profit once it had doubled. I think the thing's gone up more since.' The principle, of course, is to take your winnings while you are ahead. This was before the takeover of Midland by Hongkong &amp; Shanghai, which would probably have helped increase the value of the option further. This judicious mixture of strong investments, having made decisions based on fundamentals, plus a sensible gambler's instinct for profit at the more speculative margins, stems naturally from Mr Syms' upbringing. He is a 'fifth generation' lawyer, the son of a solicitor. Following school at Harrow, he went on to Magdalen College, Oxford, where he read history, and thence to the Bar, where he specialised in divorce law. At this time, as in childhood, his great interest was horse racing. It remains so, and a painting of the racehorse Desert Orchid now adorns his wall. His experiences during the war may also have helped to sharpen his instinct for shrewd investment: he was a gunner in Catalina flying-boats, and saw service in the North Atlantic at the height of the U-boat war, and then in India. The plane in which he was a crew member shadowed the Bismarck for seven hours. Mr Syms has another investment which at the moment might seem a little risky: he is a Lloyd's Name. This is an investment he has maintained for 42 years, since first being introduced to a syndicate by a friend from Oxford. This year, he incurred his first loss, and he is still more than satisfied with the value the investment has offered over the long term. He has short shrift for the Names currently serving Lloyd's with writs. 'I've got no sympathy with that at all.' However, he admits that many of the newer Names have not had the chance to build up reserves as he has done. But his defence of Lloyd's is resolute, and he remains greatly impressed by the Task Force's report which was published in January. He does not believe it has been dominated by insiders, but he adds: 'It is absolutely wrong that if agents have been guilty of malpractices the financial burden should fall on the Names.' At the age of 79, could caution now be seeping into his investment attitudes? Not a bit of it. One of Mr Syms' latest investments is a greyhound called Miller's Crossing. On February 5. it won the 9.00 at Wembley, netting Pounds 500 for its proud owner. Why buy a greyhound? Mr Syms' answer is simple: 'Because I couldn't afford to buy a racehorse.'</p>

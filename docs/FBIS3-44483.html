These figures will represent an increase of nine percent  over  1993.    Xu said that the afforestation work will be linked more  closely with promoting the rural economy and helping peasants to  shake off poverty. Forestry should yield environmental and  social as well as economic returns, xu stressed.    To meet next year's target, the minister said, China will  develop more cash trees and trees for industrial use, while  continuing the construction of state key forestry projects.    China will deepen the reform of the state-run forestry  centers and promote the development of township and village tree  farms. The state will also help the township and village tree  farms to transform themselves into shareholding enterprises to  benefit local farmers.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under "INFORM" rubric: "Chernobyl </F> Running a Fever"]    [Text] In the opinion of IAEA [International Atomic Energy  Agency] inspectors who have been working at Chernobyl AES  [Nuclear Electric Power Station], the sarcophagus is in a  critical state. The IAEA director general has proposed (and  Leonid Kravchuk has agreed) calling an international conference  on Chernobyl AES in the second half of April because the  station's safety level does not meet international standards.  Malfunctions have also been discovered in its operating units.    There are many reasons -- a shortage of skilled personnel  and  modern equipment, arduous working conditions. It is dangerous  to operate the Chernobyl AES. But as we know, under a decision  by the Ukrainian parliament, which was facing an energy crisis,  the station resumed work last October.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rule in paragraph (a)(1)(i) requires that a contractor conduct its work in accordance with the criteria of paragraph (c). Because DOE considers software to be a type of work, it follows that all the quality assurance requirements of the rule apply to software.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Suppliers/Subcontractors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 32. Two organizations commented that the intent of paragraph (a)(2) was not clear and that methods to implement its requirements were not provided by the rule. Additionally, a general comment was submitted exploring whether or not subcontractors and suppliers performing services for DOE are required under the provision of the rule to develop and submit a QAP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (a)(2), which required that subcontractors and suppliers comply with the ``standards of quality set forth in the QAP,'' has been deleted. After review, the Department determined that paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of the rule adequately addresses this issue by establishing basic requirements for procurement. It states that items and services (this includes items and services procured from subcontractors and suppliers) must meet established requirements and perform as expected. Subcontractors and suppliers are not required to submit to DOE their QAPs for review and approval; rather, it is left to the contractor to determine the methods for ensuring that procured items and services meet requirements and perform as expected. Any person, including indemnified contractors and their subcontractors and suppliers, subject to requirements in a QAP, may be subject to enforcement actions under part 820 if those requirements are violated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Final Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After considering the public comments, DOE has decided to adopt 10 CFR 830.1 through 830.7, 830.100, and 830.120 with the modifications described in the previous section and several editorial changes. A section by section description of the final rule follows.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 830.1 mandates that the scope of part 830 is all DOE nuclear facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 830.2 stipulates that the activities excluded from the provisions of part 830 include activities regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) or NRC Agreement States, activities conducted by the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program, and activities conducted under the Nuclear Explosives and Weapons Safety Program. The final rule has been modified to make clear that the exclusion applies to activities of the United States Enrichment Corporation to the extent that those activities have been certified by the NRC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 830.3 provides the definitions of terms related to &sect;&sect;830.1 through 830.7, 830.100, and 830.120. New definitions for ``DOE nuclear facilities'' and ``implementation plans'' have been included to remove any ambiguity concerning the meaning of these terms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 830.4, General Rule, indicates that no person shall prevent compliance with the provisions of the rule. In addition, it requires that contractors responsible for managing and operating the Department's nuclear facilities shall be responsible for implementing and complying with the provisions of part 830. Paragraph (c) has been included to make clear that contractors must comply with any plans, programs, or implementation plans required by a section and that, where required, they are intended to be the means by which compliance is determined. In particular, implementation plans will be used to set forth the manner in which full compliance with specific requirements will be attained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 830.5 provides that part 830 shall be enforced according to the provisions of 10 CFR part 820, published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on August 17, 1993 (58 FR 43680).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 830.6 requires that records be maintained such that compliance with the provisions of part 830 can be substantiated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 830.7 mandates the use of a graded approach when so indicated in a subpart. It also requires the documentation of the reasons for the selection of specific actions to be taken pursuant to the graded approach.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 830.100, Scope of subpart, provides a statement of general applicability for Subpart A of part 830.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ``Quality Assurance Requirements'' section, 830.120, mandates the development and implementation of a formalized quality assurance program. To ensure full compliance, DOE will review and approve contractor-proposed quality assurance programs and will evaluate contractor performance against the approved program including any modifications made or directed by DOE. Because of the clarification concerning implementation plans, DOE has decided to delete the proposed distinction between new and existing facilities. However, DOE does not expect to authorize the operation of any new facility unless a quality assurance program is approved and full compliance with &sect;830.120 is assured.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Procedural Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Review Under Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Today's regulatory action has been determined to be a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review,'' (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993). Accordingly, today's action was subject to review under the Executive Order by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA). There were no substantive changes between the draft submitted to OIRA and today's action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The draft of today's action and any other documents submitted to OIRA for review have been made a part of the rulemaking record and are available for public review in the Department's Freedom of Information Reading Room, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585 between the hours of 9 and 4, Monday through Friday, telephone (202) 586&hyph;6020.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

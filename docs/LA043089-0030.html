			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STANDING UP TO JAPAN  </P> <P> Interestingly, in "Standing Up to Japan" (March 12), James Fallows does not  dwell on Japan but rather devotes most of his essay to attacking the American  realization of a meritocracy. Furthermore, he argues that unless the trend  toward stratification is reversed, it will be one cause of our society's  economic decline. He laments the evidence of his thesis in the observance that  "the best and the brightest" are flocking to the law and medicine.  </P> <P> Certainly, it is unfortunate that the sciences, teaching and manufacture have  taken a back seat to the more glamorous professions, but this is not a result  of a highly efficient meritocracy. Rather, it is partly a result of a  meritocracy that doesn't function well enough. An incompetent doctor or lawyer  can still buy a house in Beverly Hills, while a brilliant scientist or teacher  struggles to provide. The economic problem that Fallows has identified is more  the result of taxing and financing policies that have encouraged the large  concentration of wealth within the corporate structure. This large  concentration of wealth can be expensed to medical insurance, legal fees,  consultant fees and investment banking fees, before taxes, while the services  procured through these expenses can help ensure management survival in the  short run. The inevitable result of these strategies has been the incredible  growth in incomes for parasitic professions. This is a gross distortion of  meritocracy.  </P> <P> MICHAEL HARRINGTON  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

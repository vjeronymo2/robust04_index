			<p><P> December 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEALING WITH SOCIOPOLITICAL WORLD CHANGES  </P> <P> I am disappointed in The Times. After spending an enjoyable hour reading your  paper, I ran across Page H7 (World Report), and an article on the Third World  poor.  </P> <P> The article was enlightening as was the adjacent chart defining the world's 11  poorest nations.  </P> <P> Why is there a picture of a dump in Manila at the center of the article, with  the caption describing 20,000 people living at the dump?  </P> <P> Your "Smokey Mountain" picture seems to be shorthand for the image of poverty.  You will note that the adjacent article does not mention the Philippines, nor  is the Philippines listed as one of the poorest countries, which it is not. In  addition, people don't "live" in the dump in Manila any more than people live  in the dump in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> There is considerable poverty in Manila, and I suggest you wait to show the  "Smokey Mountain" photo until you are reporting on the subject.  </P> <P> DAVID S. FROELICH  </P> <P> Panorama City  </P></p>

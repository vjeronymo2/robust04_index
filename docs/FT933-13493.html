			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Construction Contracts: Jamuna bridge development HYUNDAI ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION, based in South Korea, has put in the lowest bid of USDollars 221m (Pounds 147m)to build the 4.8km long Jamuna Bridge in Bangladesh. The lowest offer for the river training works came from the Dutch company, HAM/Van Oord ACZ JV. Under the first alternative, with freedom to procure stones from anywhere, it bid USDollars 309m (Pounds 206m) or alternatively USDollars 269m (Pounds 179m) providing stones were procured from neighbouring countries like India and Bhutan. Rendel Palmer &amp; Tritton, which has been involved in the project since 1986, will now work with its engineering partners, NEDECO of Holland, the local Bangladesh Consultants and the Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge Authority on evaluating all the tenders received. The Rendel Palmer &amp; Tritton-led design team has waited 18 months to reach this stage following the green light from the World Bank in January 1992 after a two-year review of the economic return of the project. The tender process was delayed by the decision of the Bangladesh government to re-tender on the river training works. A much higher price, USDollars 356m (Pounds 237m), was quoted in the first bid a few months ago when the contractor envisaged procurement of stones from countries like Malaysiaand Indonesia. The re-tendered price has been reduced by about USDollars 100m (Pounds 67m) under the option for procuring stones from neighbouring countries. The bridge will be the first fixed transport link across the river, which forms a 15km barrier, separating the western side with its fertile north-west zone, from the eastern side containing the commercial centre Dhaka and the primary port, Chittagong. The crossing will comprise a bridge structure about 4.8km wide, river training works and road embankments on the flood plain between the river training works and the high banks.</p>

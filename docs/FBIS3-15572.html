			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Berezko report under "POSTSCRIPTUM: Events and </F> Commentaries" rubric: "Prohibited Methods in Round 17, or Why  Russian-Estonian Talks Are Deadlocked"]    [Text] It is regrettable to have to state this but it is  true that the 17th round of Russo-Estonian talks did not prove  satisfactory. This is primarily because, despite the Russian  side's efforts, Estonia kept to its old positions on the problem  of the situation of the Russian-speaking population in the  country. This was stated at a news conference by special envoy  Vasiliy Svirin, leader of the Russian state delegation at the  talks with Estonia.    The Estonian side suddenly stated that Russia, to Estonia's  surprise, intends to link the withdrawal of troops to the  solution of problems of the social protection of military  pensioners. Estonia believes that Russia is making "unheard-of  demands relating to the social protection of military  pensioners."    It turns out that by "unheard-of demands" Estonia means the  elementary requirements of human rights which are unfailingly  observed in any country which presumes to call itself civilized.  Russia is insisting that the apartments inhabited by military  pensioners have become their private property. In addition, it  is the Russian side's opinion that military pensioners must be  given a residence permit so as not be outcasts in a country  where they have lived for decades. Estonia's demarche is is all  the more surprising if you recall that at the 14th round of  talks on 15 September 1993 J. Luik, leader of the Estonian  Republic delegation, stated that "the articles and provisions of  the draft agreement on the social protection of military  pensioners and members of their families as agreed at 1  September 1993 remain in force despite divergences with certain  provisions of Estonia's law 'On aliens'."    Why has there been such a drastic change of direction in  Estonian policy? The troop withdrawal treaty is ready for  initialing, but Estonia clearly does not want to sign the  agreement on the social protection of military pensioners and, I  would venture to assert, made the said statement of consent  merely to prompt Russia to withdraw the troops as quickly as  possible. The Estonian diplomats' "cunning" tactic, more  reminiscent of plain deceit, seems to be a continuation of  Tallinn's "drift" into confrontation with Moscow, which is  confirmed by Estonian President Lennart Meri's 25 February  speech in Hamburg, where the Estonian head of state urged the  West "not to trust Russia," which, he claimed, is "pursuing an  imperial policy."    However, at the news conference given by the head of the  Russian delegation it was stated that the troops will  nevertheless be withdrawn from Estonian territory before 31  August 1994 if the treaty on the withdrawal of the troops and  the agreement on the social protection of military pensioners  and members of their families are signed. "But unless we come  to such an agreement," Vasiliy Svirin said, "Russia will decide  the troop withdrawal timetable by itself"....</p>

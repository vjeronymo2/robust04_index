			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / International Bonds: Chinese issue highlights hunger for extra yield THE hunger of US bond buyers for extra yield remains undiminished. That is the message from the continuing stream of 'firsts' to hit the US bond markets: recent days have seen the first offering by a Chinese issuer, and the first 100-year corporate bonds to be sold for 40 years. With the yield on US Treasuries back near historic lows at the end of last week, investors seem ready to consider anything that offers a decent yield premium. Last week's Dollars 250m issue from China International Trust and Investment Corporation (Citic) spoke volumes about the new spirit of adventure among US bond investors. A year ago, the issuer - a government-owned entity which finances joint ventures in China - would have been lucky to get a hearing in the market. Last week investors were prepared to give the Baa1/ triple-B rated Citic 10-year money at a yield spread of only one percentage point over Treasuries, around a quarter of a percentage point lower than had been anticipated. The fact that the size of the issue was raised from Dollars 150m to Dollars 250m said a lot about the strength of demand - even though there is little opportunity for investors to benefit from the sort of spread-narrowing which made early buyers of Latin American bonds rich. Investors who felt uncomfortable with the political risk in Chinese bonds have had the opportunity instead to lend to such comfortably familiar borrowers as Walt Disney, a rare issuer of straight bonds, and Coca-Cola. The twist: they won't get their money back for 100 years. To many corporate treasurers and fixed-income investors, such long-dated instruments seem difficult to justify. For investors, there is the perceived risk of lending to companies which simply may not be around in 100 years. Mickey Mouse and Coca-Cola may seem immortal today, but the Marlboro price cut this year has shaken investors' confidence in the longevity of premium-priced brands. For treasurers, such long-term money raises different issues. Few, if any, can claim to have assets with such ultra-long lives against which to match the liability. Why pay a premium over normal long-dated borrowing, however small that premium may seem? And how can they justify a move which has implications which stretch way beyond their company's planning horizon? Walt Disney, whose characters are deeply engrained in the American psyche, probably has as much of a case as any for the durability of its assets. Mr Steve Schoch, assistant treasurer, says the Disney name and cartoon characters provide the long-term underpinning for the company. 'Those characters have had 50 or 60 or 70 years' life already, with increasing popularity around the world. There is no reason to expect that to fade,' he says. Disney's Dollars 300m issue carries a yield of 95 basis points over Treasuries, while Coca-Cola's Dollars 150m deal was launched at an 80 basis point spread. Such debt looks attractive compared with other components of a company's long-term capital. The 7.5 per cent coupon on the Disney bonds (issued at par) is equivalent to an after-tax cost to the company of less than 5 per cent, says Mr Jim Pelgrift of Morgan Stanley. With expectations of long-term inflation at between 3 per cent to 4 per cent, that leaves a negligible real cost of capital. For investors, the argument for buying such debt is simple: extra yield. Treasury yields at all maturities are at historic lows, forcing so-called 'total return funds' to look for extra returns elsewhere. And though the 100-year maturity looks scary, the duration of the ultra-long dated bonds (that is, their average life, when all future cashflows are discounted back to present value) is only a little higher than a conventional 30-year bond. That is because the yield premium in the early years, in present value terms, makes up for much of the long-term cashflow. The Disney bonds have a duration of 13.7 years, while Coca-Cola's are just over 14 years, compared with just under 13 years for a 30-year bond. This extra duration, and the yield premium, are a way for investors to gear up their exposure to the long end of the bond market. Perhaps surprisingly, given the popularity of the Citic and 100-year issues, yield spreads on conventional corporate bonds have not been driven lower by the hunt for higher returns. The spread on a typical 10-year bond issue from a double-A credit is around 40-50 basis points, much the same as it has been for some time. The reason may be the sheer volume of bond issuance in the market this year. In the first three months, US companies raised a record amount through straight bond issues, a level which was almost matched in the second quarter. The supply of new junk (sub-investment grade) bonds followed a similar pattern. The yield on the Merrill Lynch junk bond index at the end of last week was hovering around 400 basis points above Treasuries - back to its level of the late 1980s, before the crash that sent yield spreads out to more than 900. There is some Dollars 22bn of new junk bonds in the pipeline, says one analyst - nearly as much as the total issued so far this year. The deluge of bonds has helped Wall Street broking houses report record results this year. Underwriting fee levels have held steady, at around 40 basis points, having fallen to that level from 60 basis points some 18 months ago, says Mr Guy Moszkowski, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. The Wall Street houses may never have it so good again. Commercial banks, with little in the way of loan growth to look forward to, have been eyeing the corporate bond market for some time. The five that had already won dispensation from the Federal Reserve to underwrite and trade bonds - JP Morgan, Bankers Trust, Citicorp, Chase Manhattan and Chemical - were joined last week by a sixth, NationsBank. The ambitious North Carolina-based 'super-regional' made its intentions clear earlier this year when it hired Mr John Griff, formerly head of syndicate for Lehman Brothers, to set up and run its bond department. Its natural customers are not the large corporations which have the easiest access to the public debt markets. 'We hope to open up to the market to medium-sized companies,' NationsBank said. The arrival of the commercial banks makes it likely that, come the next underwriting boom, Wall Street will not have things all its own way.</p>

			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: British Airways Judging by the market's calm reaction investors are remarkably sanguine about Bill Clinton's threat to block BA's investment in USAir. Perhaps his comments really were just end-of-campaign rhetoric which will quickly be forgotten once the race for the White House is over. But if the British airline's meticulously laid plans ultimately unravel - and one senses a growing air of worry at BA - its shares are almost certain to suffer in the short term. There is little doubt that rival US carriers such as Delta, United and American have cleverly exploited the USAir issue. Their specific objections to the BA deal hardly stand up on close inspection, but they have played the jobs and level playing field cards for all they are worth. Naturally they do not stress that BA's support will effectively underpin a competitor which they would be much happier to see going out of business. The real lever, though, is the bilateral negotiation between the US and UK governments over access to the UK market. Talks were suspended yesterday until November 10, but it remains far from clear that the American side will be satisfied with the gradualist 'open skies' plan currently on the table. From BA's point of view, the Dollars 750m which it is splashing out on USAir may only be justified if it can retain and consolidate its strong profitable position on the North Atlantic routes. Given the sums involved, moreover, BA can hardly abandon the condition which effectively gives it a blocking minority on key issues. Assuming Mr Clinton wins, there is still some tough dealing ahead. BA shareholders can only hope that the company has squared the Democrats as effectively as it has lobbied the Republicans.</p>

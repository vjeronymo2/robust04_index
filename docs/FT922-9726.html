			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Appeal for more US aid to east: Kohl warns there is no 'rational alternative to continuous support' CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl of Germany yesterday made an impassioned appeal for more US help for the crumbling economies of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. 'If the new democracies are left to cope alone with their difficulties, then there could be a new flood of refugees to the west and other uncontrollable political developments,' he warned in a speech prepared for the annual congress of the American Newspaper Publishers' Association in New York. 'The west has no choice. There is no rational alternative to comprehensive and continuous support,' Mr Kohl added. Germany, meanwhile, was already committed to DM105bn (Pounds 35.7bn) in aid and had reached the limits of its ability to help. The issue would be 'right at the top' of his agenda at the Group of Seven world economic summit planned for Munich in July. The chancellor, who will chair the summit, had been concerned that his plan to focus the meeting on what he considers Germany's greatest foreign policy issues would be marred by top-level wrangling over the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Now, he indicated, there was reason to hope the negotiations would be over by the end of June. The current situation in eastern Europe was comparable with the 'great upheavals' which followed the First and Second World Wars, he said, pointing to the 'dangerous expansionist tendencies' in countries like the former Yugoslavia. By 1945 the US government had learnt from the mistakes of President Woodrow Wilson, who withdrew from Europe after the First World War. America's success story in post-war Germany should now be a model for its policies towards former Cold War enemies in the east, the chancellor said. 'We Germans are experiencing in our country just how difficult the task is. In spite of enormous transfers to the former GDR the process of growing together is not progressing either as quickly or as free of friction as we would wish,' Mr Kohl said. George Graham adds: Mr Ross Perot, the Texas businessman who is seeking to enter the US presidential elections as an independent candidate, complained yesterday of a dirty tricks campaign by the Republican party to discredit him, and said he would stop most of his public appearances over the next few weeks so he could work out where he stood on policy issues. Mr Perot, who is best known for his Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.6bn) fortune, was speaking at the American Newspaper Publishers' Association congress in New York.</p>

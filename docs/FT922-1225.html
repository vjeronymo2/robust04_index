			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / India faces battle over presidency THE CONTEST for the post of the president of India - normally a straightforward election for a ceremonial position - seems to be turning into a bitter battle between the ruling Congress party and its opponents. The Congress party last week nominated Mr Shankar Dayal Sharma, the country's vice-president, for the election in July to replace the incumbent, Mr R. Venkataraman. In doing so, Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister and party leader, did not hold consultations with the opposition parties, abandoning his proclaimed stand of being a consensus seeker. The opposition retaliated by seeking a candidate to oppose Mr Sharma, but in so doing exposed its deep political divisions. First, the opposition insisted that it should be allowed to decide who the vice-president should be if Mr Sharma were elected. Then, Mr V P Singh, the former prime minister and leader of Janata Dal, created controversy by maintaining that the next president should belong to what are known as the scheduled castes (harijans) or a tribe considered backward under the constitution. The opposition parties found it difficult to find a common candidate despite a series of consultations they have held among themselves. Mr G G Swell, a former deputy speaker of the Indian parliament and a former diplomat, has found the most support and he is expected to run against Mr Sharma. He is from a tribal background in the north-eastern state of Meghalaya. Mr Swell is, however, not supported by the Marxists and Left parties who have welcomed Mr Sharma's choice. In the meantime, another opposition leader, Mr Ram Jethmalani, a lawyer, has left the Janata Dal for failing to nominate him for the post and has declared his own candidature. Opposition parties are continuing their talks and yesterday the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Hindu revivalist party which is the largest opposition grouping, declared its support for Mr Swell. A hard-fought contest now appears inevitable. The president is chosen by an electoral college made up by the two houses of parliament and the state legislatures. While opposition differences strengthen the chances of Mr Sharma, his election is by no means a certainty because the Congress is in a minority in parliament and a number of states are ruled by non-Congress parties.</p>

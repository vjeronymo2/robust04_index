			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Observer: End of the line The government's handling of its own insolvency statistics becomes more and more bizarre. It has already contracted out publication of the embarrassing figures on corporate and personal failures to the British Chambers of Commerce. Now it seems to have severed all links with the data by not even issuing a release that they are available. First warning that the latest figures were out came via a press release offering reaction from the ever-more responsive body of the UK's remaining growth industry: the Society of Practitioners of Insolvency.</p>

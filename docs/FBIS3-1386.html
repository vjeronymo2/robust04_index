			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Radio Today" program presented by Rodney Trudgeon] </F>   [Text] [Trudgeon] Thousands of Soweto commuters were  prevented from getting to Johannesburg this morning as roads  leading out of this area were barricaded. We have on the line a  resident from Soweto, Chris Mabuye. Good morning, Mr. Mabuye.  What exactly was the problem?    [Mabuye] The streets are barricaded, you know, and exits  towards the city.    [Trudgeon] All the exits?    [Mabuye] Most exits. I mean, we have got one, the Main Reef  Road, which is from the Potchefstroom highway, which is  completely sealed. People have to use the Eldorado  Park-Kliptown road to come into town.    [Trudgeon] What are they barricaded with, Chris?    [Mabuye] Stones, cars, you know, wrecked cars that are  broken, and all that.    [Trudgeon] What is the reason for this?    [Mabuye] The reason is the march for Zulus, marching today.    [Trudgeon] And have there been any signs of any tension or  trouble or...    [Mabuye] Well, a lot of people have been injured. I believe  there are two deaths already on the road.    [Trudgeon] How did that happen?    [Mabuye] One was shot, the other one was hit by a stone.    [Trudgeon] So are most commuters then trapped in Soweto at  the moment?    [Mabuye] Yes. Some are not even able to come out.    [Trudgeon] Is there a police presence?    [Mabuye] Yes, they have just come in now.    [Trudgeon] And what is happing now as I am talking to you?    [Mabuye] The people are afraid because of the barricades.  They cannot maneuver through the barricades. And another thing  is that the Carlton Center, it's like almost what happened in  Mafikeng. There's a lot of shooting there, and people are  running for their lives.    [Trudgeon] Has this just happened this morning?    [Mabuye] This morning.    [Trudgeon] So it's a surprise to all the residents?    [Mabuye] Yes, and we have two buses from Alberton which were  -- how do I put it -- were stoned, their windscreens were  smashed out.    [Trudgeon] And you've no idea who is responsible for this?    [Mabuye] It's the youth, black youths that were running  amok.    [Trudgeon] Thank you, Chris. That's Chris Mabuye, a resident  of Soweto. And when contacted, the police confirmed that there  were problems in the township, but that details were sketchy at  this stage.</p>

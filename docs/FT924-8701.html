			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Maastricht legislation faces obstacle course - The bill's timetable IF ANY observer believed last week's government victory over Tory Euro-sceptics marked the begining of the end of the Maastricht treaty's ratification in the UK, the subsequent confusion has provided a sobering lesson in the realities of Westminster procedures - and Conservative party internal dynamics. For government business managers trying to steer the bill through parliament the way ahead resembles an obstacle course surrounded in fog. Nobody is quite sure where the next hurdle lies or when the race will finish. The outline timetable goes something like this: Before Christmas the bill will return to the Commons for that start of its 'committee stage'. Two or three days will be set aside. (The formal 'first reading' and two days of debate to give the bill a 'second reading,' and approve the broad principles of the legislation, took place before the Danish referendum in June). Euro-sceptics are certain to raise hundreds of points of order, each of which has to be answered by Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Commons speaker. This may take several days. Work will then begin on the hundreds of amendments tabled by Maastricht's opponents and the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties. Even though not all of these will be chosen for debate, and many of those that are will be grouped, that will still leave a substantial number of separate discussions, each of which could last a few hours. In practice little headway will be made with the substance of the bill before MPs break for Christmas. Time will be allocated throughout the first half of next year for the Committee stage to continue, with other legislation considered concurrently. There is no hint yet that the government plans to bring in a 'guillotine' motion which would timetable debate. The official line is that the Maastricht treaty includes important constitutional change deserving serious consideration. But the unspoken sub-text is that Euro-sceptics were told last week that the 'third reading' - which follows the committee stage line-by-line consideration of the whole bill - will not come before the second Danish referendum. This, the government argues, will not be until May. While some cabinet ministers believe the referendum and the third reading are not interdependent, Downing Street is sticking to the line that May is the most likely time for the Danish poll - and the third reading. What happens if the detailed committee stage debate collapses well before then - so the third reading could take place in April - is not clear. Also unclear is what happens should the referendum in Denmark be delayed beyond May. If the bill is to complete its passage before the end of the current session  -as it must do unless the process has to start all over again  - it must go to the House of Lords before the summer recess. Peers' consideration of the bill cannot start until after the Commons' third reading. The process in the Lords is a similar mix of debate in principle and discussion of detail, finishing with a third reading debate. Although by convention peers do not throw out a bill that is a manifesto commitment, with many of Maastricht's most vociferous opponents in the upper house - including Baroness Thatcher - its passage there will not necessarily be smooth. If the Lords has amended the bill at all, it must return to the Commons, as the final form of the legislation has to be agreed by both MPs and peers. If MPs refuse to accept changes made in the Lords, the bill could 'ping pong' back and forth between the two chambers until agreement is reached - although the Commons always has the final say. This could mean a last-minute rush to get the bill though before the end of the session. Usually the date for the state opening of the next session is fixed well in advance for sometime in November. The Queen cannot be delayed. In the final - and purely technical - stage, the Queen signifies her agreement, and this Royal Assent turns the bill into an Act, completing the parliamentary process.</p>

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: Earnings jump at Sino Land Sino Land, the property development and investment company which is to become a constituent of the Hang Seng Index in February, yesterday reported a 64 per cent surge in net profits to HKDollars 1.48bn (USDollars 191.7m) for the year to June 30, compared with HKDollars 900.59m in 1992-93. Shareholders are to receive a one-for-10 bonus share issue in addition to a final dividend of 16 cents. The dividend may be taken in new shares or cash. Earnings per share, on a fully diluted basis, rose 47 per cent to 63.8 cents from 43.3 cents. Sino Land, traditionally one of Hong Kong's most aggressive property developers, bought eight sites with a potential gross floor area of around 1.3m sq ft in the year. It now has a land bank of some 12.7m sq ft, of which seven projects are to come on stream in 1994-95. The group is stepping up its investment in industrial properties and is planning to modify some of its better located sites into industrial/office developments to meet growing demand. Around one-third of the land bank is made up of investment properties, and gross rental income last year rose 15 per cent to HKDollars 758.7m. The total value of the group's investment properties stood at HKDollars 25.4bn at the end of the financial year, an increase of 70 per cent. Mr Robert Ng, chairman, expects rental income to play an increasingly important part in group profitability. Sino Land plans to spin off its hotel interests in a separate listing, and yesterday submitted a formal application for the listing of the new hospitality arm, Newco. Mr Ng noted that while steps to cool the property market - taken by both the government and the banks, which lend up to a maximum 70 per cent of property values - had proved to be effective, the fundamentals of sound economic growth, rising real incomes and a shortage of land mean properties remain an attractive investment.</p>

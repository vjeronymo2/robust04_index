			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Sharp fall in bond yields elevates Dow Wall Street ENCOURAGED by a big fall in bond yields, US share prices posted solid gains yesterday as investors brushed off disappointing news on the economy, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 24.91 up at 3,552.34, within three points of its all-time high, set last week. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 3.64 higher at 453.83, while the Nasdaq composite appreciated 3.75 to 704.28. Trading volume on the New York SE came to 230.7m shares. After the holiday weekend, traders and investors returned to the markets in subdued mood. Sentiment was not helped by the morning's main economic news, the National Association of Purchasing Management's May report, which showed that its index of manufacturing activity rose only slightly last month to 51.1 per cent. The rise was smaller than expected as analysts had forecast a level of 53.2 per cent. One aspect of the report that was particularly troubling was the decline in the employment component. Coming just a few days before the May jobs report is released, the decline suggested that labour market conditions remain depressed throughout the economy. The bad news on employment, and the fall in the NAPM's inflation indicator, however, cheered Treasury market investors, who pushed bond prices higher and yields sharply lower. At one point the bond rally, also partly triggered by falling gold prices, sent the Dow into record territory, but late selling trimmed the gain for the index. Bally Manufacturing jumped Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 9 3/8 in volume of 4.2m shares after the company said it planned to build a second dockside casino in Mississippi. Commodore International plunged Dollars 1 to Dollars 3 in heavy trading after reporting a fiscal third-quarter loss of Dollars 5.37 a share, compared with the 12 cents a share profit earned a year earlier. Motor issues were higher on news of a rise in consumer spending. Ford firmed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 53, Chrysler Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 45 1/4 and General Motors Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 40 3/8 . Raytheon put on Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 55 3/4 on news that the defence contractor had bought the corporate jet business of British Aerospace for about Dollars 387m. McDonald's moved up Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 50 1/8 after Mr Michael Quinlan, the chairman and chief executive, revealed that the company was considering the possibility of splitting the common stock and said he was bullish about business prospects. On the Nasdaq market, technology shares were stronger, Intel adding Dollars 4 5/8 at Dollars 115 1/2 , Microsoft Dollars 3 5/8 at Dollars 96 1/4 and Oracle Systems Dollars 2 1/2 at Dollars 44 1/4 . Canada TORONTO was weighed down by a sharply retreating gold shares sector, the TSE 300 index finishing 25.8 off at 3,856.9. However, advancing issues narrowly outnumbered declines by 390 to 374 after heavy volume of 69.8m shares valued at CDollars 553m. The golds sub-group index dropped 4.6 per cent as the precious metal price in New York fell USDollars 8.25 to USDollars 369.75 an ounce amid profit-taking. Real estate had the day's biggest gain, 1.1 per cent, while the energy sector rose 1.0 per cent. Among golds, American Barrick tumbled CDollars 1 3/8 to CDollars 28 and Placer Dome CDollars 1 1/8 to CDollars 21 3/4.</p>

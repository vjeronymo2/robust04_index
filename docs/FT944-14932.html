			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: Moody's lowers Banco di Napoli credit rating Banco di Napoli, one of Italy's largest banks, has had its credit rating downgraded by Moody's, the US credit rating agency, because of pressure on the bank's profitability and 'deteriorating asset quality', writes Andrew Hill in Milan. Salomon Brothers, the international investment bank, was yesterday forced to improve the terms of a Dollars 100m issue of Banco di Napoli five-year floating-rate notes, which it had sold to investors just before the Moody's announcement on Tuesday night. Salomon, which said it had no prior warning of the downgrade, also offered to buy back the floating-rate notes from angry investors. Moody's downgraded the rating of Banco di Napoli for long-term senior deposits to Baa1 from A2, and to Baa2 for subordinated deposits, from A3. The ratings for senior and subordinated debt of the bank and its subsidiaries were also lowered. The downgrade comes as a further blow to Banco di Napoli, one of Italy's longest established banks. Last month, the bank announced disappointing first-half results, after making heavy provisions against bad loans. Since then, the bank's share price has declined 17 per cent, although it held firm yesterday.</p>

			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Extension of BSE ban based on new experiment This week's extension of the list of cattle products banned in the UK is based on new evidence, proving for the first time that BSE or 'mad cow disease' can infect more of the animal than just the brain and spinal cord. An experiment by agriculture ministry scientists showed last month that the small intestines of six-month-old calves, who had themselves been fed large amounts of BSE-infected brains, could pass the infection to laboratory mice. The findings prompted an emergency meeting of the government's scientific advisory committee on BSE. It concluded that the 'theoretical risk of infection of man via food derived from infected calves is miniscule if it occurs at all, but information on calves is still very limited'. The agriculture ministry added intestines and thymus glands of calves under six months old to the list of prohibited cattle products. Offal from older animals - brain, spinal cord, spleen, thymus, tonsils and intestines - has been banned since 1989. Calves' intestines are traditionally used in beef sausage production. Mr Gavin Strang, Labour's agriculture spokesman, urged the government yesterday to extend the ban further to include calves' brains and other offal. He said: 'No one is going to criticise ministers for excessive caution when it comes to BSE.' But Dr Kenneth Calman, the government's chief medical officer and Mr Keith Meldrum, the chief veterinary officer, insisted in a joint statement that calves' brains were 'not considered in the light of the available evidence to present any risk'. Mr Meldrum said it was 'not surprising' that the BSE agent was present in the calves' intestines. The agent's incubation period suggested that it would not show up in the brains of animals less than 1 1/2 years old. BSE has affected 130,500 animals in the UK since it was first reported in 1985. The epidemic started to decline last year with new cases now running at about 500 a week, against 1,000 at its peak. A few microbiologists - notably Professor Richard Lacey of Leeds University and Dr Stephen Dealler of York District Hospital - have demanded far stronger government action to reduce the risk that BSE could cause an epidemic of Creutzfeld-Jacob Disease, its human equivalent. Such fears have provoked German moves to ban British beef imports. Dr Calman reiterated that there was no evidence that BSE - or eating beef - could cause CJD. 'I must provide the best advice to the public, whatever the consequences,' he said. 'If there was any evidence that suggested a link between BSE and CJD, then I would regard it as my responsibility to bring it to public attention.' Mainstream scientific opinion continues to support the official line. 'I have not modified my diet and I still eat beef,' said Dr John Collinge of St Mary's Hospital Medical School, London, a leading researcher into the infectious proteins that are believed to cause BSE, CJD and other brain-destroying diseases.</p>

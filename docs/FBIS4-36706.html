The court is presided over by lawyer Major Muhammad  al-Bahri, with lawyers Major Fawzi 'Awdah and lawyer Lieutenant  Muhammad Abu-Samih as members. Lawyer Lieutenant Colonel Mahmud  Khalil al-Bashtawi has been appointed public prosecutor and  representative of the military prosecution.    The court opened its first sitting at the military command  hall in Jericho the day before yesterday with the first military  case involving Captain Yusuf 'Aytah. On 13 May, a child, 'Ammar  Rushdi al-Shawwa, age 13, fidgeted with 'Aytah's rifle amid  popular celebrations to mark the Palestinian security forces  entry into Jericho, causing the weapon to go off, killing the  child instantly and injuring his mother and a third person.  [passage omitted]    Lt. Col. al-Bashtawi told AL-DUSTUR that the Palestinian  military court will rely on Jordanian and Egyptian laws in the  absence of Palestinian military laws, until Palestinian  legislation is issued.

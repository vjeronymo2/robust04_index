			<p><P> June 5, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHINA IN TURMOIL;  </P> <P> 1,500 AT CONSULATE IN L.A. MOURN BEIJING DEAD  </P> <P> Chinese students in Los Angeles replaced the blue ribbons they have worn to  support the struggle for democracy in their homeland with black and white ones  of mourning Sunday when 1,500 demonstrators gathered at the Chinese Consulate  to grieve for the dead in Beijing and to condemn the government that carried  out the violence.  </P> <P> It was an emotional gathering in front of consulate headquarters in the  mid-Wilshire district -- one that united students from China, who had only  recently arrived here to attend college, with Chinese-Americans who have lived  in the United States all their lives.  </P> <P> During the course of the five-hour demonstration, the students staged a mock  funeral procession in memory of those killed, played a tape-recording of a  telephone conversation that took place on Saturday between students in China  and the United States, then read a "letter to the world" condemning the actions  of the Chinese government and calling on the world community to investigate the  Beijing massacre.  </P> <P> Although many of the songs, chants and speeches used during the protest were in  Mandarin, the emotions and actions of the demonstrators spoke a universal  language.  </P> <P> There was the quiet sobbing that permeated the stillness when six men, in the  center of a small procession, carried a gray coffin through the crowd, laid it  on the steps of the consulate and covered it with a red, white and blue flag  symbolizing Chinese solidarity.  </P> <P> There were the solemn expressions and tears of the protesters as they listened  to a 12-minute tape in which a student at Beijing University told students at  Caltech in Pasadena to let the people know "that the darkest and bloodiest  tragedy in human history is happening in China. But . . . the final victory  belongs to the people."  </P> <P> There were also moments marked by bursts of applause and song. The crowd  clapped when Weichang Li, 32, a UCLA graduate student and lifelong Chinese  Communist, stood up and, with tears in his eyes, denounced his party. They  clapped when a student representative, speaking for the Southern California  Chinese Student and Scholar Assns., asked for all Chinese people to unite and  told China's leaders that "in the heart of 1 billion Chinese people, you are  dead."  </P> <P> And they sang. The song was called "If We Unite, We Will Have the Power," said  Chang Lei, a 29-year-old student at USC.  </P> <P> The tune was appropriate, the students said, in an ironic way. It was the song  the Chinese people sang during the Communist revolution, which triumphed 40  years ago.  </P></p>

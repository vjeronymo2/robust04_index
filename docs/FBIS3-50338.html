			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Geneva, 27 Jan (TANJUG) -- Speaking about the  meeting with his Croatian colleague Mate Granic, Federal Deputy  Prime Minister Zeljko Simic told TANJUG that the most important  thing was that today's meeting with representatives of the  Croatian Government, which lasted nearly six hours, took place  in a highly tolerant atmosphere.    In Simic's assessment, today's meeting is paving the way  toward the realization of the joint declaration signed by the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Croatia two weeks ago in  Geneva.    Two exceptionally important proposals were made concrete  today: To set up a joint commission under the aegis of  international humanitarian organizations (ICRC [International  Committee of the Red Cross] and UNHCR).    Deputy Prime Minister Simic laid special emphasis on the  beginning of regular visits by highest-ranking officials from  Belgrade and Zagreb, which in practice starts on 12 February  when the FRY deputy prime minister will be received by Croatian  President Franjo Tudjman. In Simic's opinion, this will, at the  same time, be an inaugural meeting of the Commission for Missing  Persons.    Serbian-Croatian relations can be successfully resolved only  through bilateral efforts and this is an example of how to  tackle the crisis in former Yugoslavia, said the Yugoslav deputy  prime minister, concluding his statement for TANJUG.</p>

			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Latin American Debt Crisis: 'For us Mexicans, the crisis is over' - Angel Gurria / The Key International Personalities / Ten years ago next month the Latin American debt crisis broke - and threw the world financial system into turmoil. On these pages writers who followed the story for the Financial Times from the outset analyse how the crisis was handled. And they pose the question: Is there life after debt? 'THE debt issue was not the cause of the crisis, it was the end result. It was only a manifestation of a long period of overspending and overvaluation of the currency,' says Mr Angel Gurria, under-secretary for international financial affairs at Mexico's Ministry of Finance, writes Stephen Fidler. Mr Gurria was a leading negotiator for Mexico from the beginning of the crisis. 'Everybody thought that oil prices would continue to rise and we counted on a conventional wisdom which didn't materialise. We had a commodity that was scarce and highly valued, and it looked as if it was going to stay that way for ever. We had a public deficit equivalent to around 16-17 per cent of GDP and a current account deficit financed with public debt. 'All this left no doubt as to what the next administration should do. . . The agenda was very clear.' When reserves dwindled, as a result of falling oil prices and capital flight, Mexico made a key decision in August 1982 to approach the debt issue as a political one, involving the governments of the rich countries, whose banking systems would be threatened, rather than as a purely financial problem, Mr Gurria says. Now, he declares: 'For us, the debt problem is over. The foreign debt of Mexico is now equivalent to 31 per cent of GDP, and it was as high as 76 per cent. The public foreign debt is 24 per cent of GDP, and was 60 per cent. With domestic debt at 13 per cent of GDP, all our public debt is equivalent to 38 per cent of GDP.'</p>

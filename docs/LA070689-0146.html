			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JOSEPH N. BELL: HOT TIME IN NEW TOWN OPENS A LONG JOURNEY  </P> <P> For the next six weeks, I'll be driving across the United States, sending back  periodic reports about how things look out there to a three-decade resident of  California's Orange County. I'll be driving alone to Florida's Orange County --  across Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and the southeastern states. My wife and  stepson will fly to Florida to vacation (I hope that's what it will be) with me  at Walt Disney World and later in North Carolina. Then they'll fly home and  I'll drive back to California through the Midwest.  </P> <P> Those who think I'm out of my mind to drive 7,000 miles in the worst heat of  summer, listen up. I'll be telling you why it refreshes and re-energizes me.  And I'll also be writing about some of the riches of this country that can only  be seen by car.  </P> <P> Since it has become a staple to a growing number of Orange County people --  particularly those who own boats -- I decided to spend my first night checking  out Laughlin, Nev. If nothing else, it conditioned me for the heat I'll be  experiencing the rest of my trip.  </P> <P> I hit Laughlin on a Saturday night. The temperature had been 102 during the  day, and the body heat from the crowds in the casinos must have pushed it up  another 10 degrees that night.  </P> <P> Las Vegas it ain't -- which isn't necessarily bad. Although both cities exist  primarily because of gambling (the Laughlin newspaper is called the Weekly  Gambler and has a pair of dice and a royal flush in spades on the masthead),  the similarity -- right now, at least -- ends there. Laughlin is a kinder,  gentler, down-home Vegas (I haven't seen so many cowboy hats since I went to an  Oklahoma-Texas football game years ago). And most of the people with whom I  talked had the twang to go along.  </P> <P> Laughlin is built on the Colorado River, which separates it from Bullhead City  on the other side. Water taxis carry commuters back and forth. The river serves  multiple purposes in Laughlin. It's nice to look at, provides a launching pad  for boaters (and sells all sorts of water trips), offers a natural "strip" for  the casinos, and is even fit for swimming -- in spite of all the boats I saw  plying the river. The new Harrahs had a well-populated swimming beach, and from  above, the water looked quite clear.  </P> <P> It takes almost exactly the same amount of time to drive to Laughlin from  Orange County as it does to Vegas, even though the last 40 miles to Laughlin  are over a roller-coaster two-lane road. Right now, it's about the only way to  get to Laughlin, but that will be changing soon. Work has just gotten under way  on a new, 7,500-foot runway at the Laughlin airport that will cost $26 million  and be able to provide landing room for aircraft the size of a Boeing 727.  </P> <P> And that's not all that is changing in Laughlin. The first thing that strikes a  visitor is the construction activity. Virtually every existing hotel is  building an addition, some larger than the original. Harrahs -- which just  opened a few months ago -- is already working on doubling its size. The  Flamingo Hilton is now going up. And ground has been broken for the most  expensive hotel-casino project in Nevada -- an $800-million resort that will  include four hotels and an 18-hole PGA championship golf course.  </P> <P> The numbers are almost stupefying. Laughlin's gaming revenues have been  increasing at the rate of about $100 million per year, housing is booming and  so is population (from 95 people just five years ago to 3,500 today), with a  work force of 12,000.  </P> <P> The hotel-casinos have names like Colorado Belle and Pioneer and Riverside and  Ramada Express. So many parking lots are being built over that the casinos are  running buses to distant parking places -- which makes Harrahs' covered garage  next to the casino one of the primary attractions in town.  </P> <P> The current entertainment tends to be heavily country (the headliner the night  I visited was Waylon Jennings, the "Nashville Rebel"), and the blackjack  dealers talk spiritedly with customers about remote towns in Idaho or Oklahoma.  And although there is much, much smoking, there are also numerous nonsmoking  gambling tables and single-deck blackjack -- both civilized customs hard to  come by in Las Vegas.  </P> <P> The certainty that all this is going to change very soon sent me away feeling a  little sad. We don't really need another Las Vegas in Laughlin, with hard-eyed  blackjack dealers, $100 tables, dreadful architecture and people pushing one  another around looking hassled and unhappy. But it's going to take a lot of  high rollers to pay for all those new casinos in Laughlin, and the folks I met  there somehow didn't fit that picture very well. Neither did the nickel slots  and $2 blackjack tables and friendliness of the help still prevalent in  Laughlin that almost make losing your money fun.  </P> <P> Oh well, maybe we can start another town up the river a bit.  </P></p>

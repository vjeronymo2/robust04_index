			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris </F> Silajdzic by Ivica Puljic; place and date not given: "Also Open  for `Others'"]    [Text] Haris Silajdzic, prime minister of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, said the following for OSLOBODJENJE:    [Silajdzic] The agreement on federation is the first step  toward peace and it would not have happened without the  participation of the United States. All those talks are already  producing results on the ground. Croatian forces are no longer  participating in battles around Maglaj and conflicts in central  Bosnia and Mostar have stopped. That is the most important  thing. On the ground, with the help of one team made up of  Americans and other allies, forces must be disengaged and the  structure of a new Bosnia-Herzegovina army must be created.  That means we would have a defense alliance with Croatia  regarding military matters. As far as other things are  concerned, if God lets us -- all of us living in these parts --  come to our senses and establish some sort of peace, then such  an alliance opens up tremendous possibilities, especially as  everyone is more willing to invest in peace than in war.    [Puljic] Does this agreement foresee a presidential or a  parliamentary system?    [Silajdzic] It will be a combination of parliamentary and  presidential systems. Regardless of what it will be, I hope it  will become effective and that it will lead us into either a  presidential or a parliamentary system. It does not matter what  it is, as long as it exists. We will try to consider the  possibility of agreement with the Serbian side. Then we have  much to do to prepare and draft the constitution of the  federation and the confederate agreement with Croatia. After we  have agreed on the text of the constitution and of the agreement  on confederation, President Izetbegovic and President Tudjman  are expected to sign a confederate agreement here in Washington.    [Puljic] The United States has evidently demonstrated the  initiative and this could have a very beneficial effect on  Bosnia- Herzegovina.    [Silajdzic] It is not a coincidence that all this happened  in the United States and I think Washington is the right place  for something like that. The seed we planted two years ago is  slowly shooting. I have always believed Bosnia is a global  issue and that it can only be solved as such. That is possible  only if all world factors become involved, and the United States  is the number-one world factor. You see that there are already  some results. Our contacts with the United States are on the  highest level. That is very important, for, in a way, it brings  balance to those relations. Naturally, when we say world  factors, we mean others as well. The Russian Federation is one  of those factors and that is why we will intensify contacts  directly through the United States in order to reach a final  solution. I am supposed to go to Moscow and meet with Kosyrev  and other leading Russian politicians. The Russians are an  important factor in this process. In Moscow, we will discuss  the possibility of making an agreement with the Serbian side.    Furthermore, I talked to Mr. Juppe, French foreign minister,  and we understood France would continue to be positively  involved in solving the problem of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Mr.  Juppe said he would like to meet with me in Paris and I hope we  will hold that meeting. In Bosnia-Herzegovina, on the ground, it  is now most important that the United States and other allies  help us. They will probably send a good team headed by one of  the U.S. generals, regarding the disengagement of forces and the  agreement, first on separation and then also on forming a  military structure in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Puljic] Is a new world order being created, and to what  extent is Bosnia-Herzegovina a part of global events?    [Silajdzic] Those who doubted the fact that  Bosnia-Herzegovina is involved in creating a new world order now  realize they were wrong. That was our thesis from the very  beginning. Bosnia- Herzegovina is a small country, but it plays  an important role in international relations and this engagement  of the United States and the allies, even Russia, proves that.  You know, regardless of the world order we have, it must be  founded on some kind of principles and on respecting the order.  Genocide in the heart of Europe, aggression, the destruction of  towns.... That is not a world order, that is a disorder that  will sooner or later lead to war, not only in that region, but  also in Europe and the world. The new order must be founded on  the principle of rights and not on the principle of force. If  it is not so, we will not have any kind of order or world order,  but world disorder. That is the whole matter. In Bosnia, we  had to prove there is order and that the order, if disrupted, is  being established -- by force. That is very important. And  that is why this is an opportunity not only for the Bosniaks and  the Croats, not only for Bosnia and Croatia, but also for the  Serbian side to realize that people must live together in the  world. That people must talk at a negotiating table and not  solve problems using guns. This is an opportunity for everybody  to be included in the peace process. This process includes the  Bosniaks and the Croats and does not leave anybody out.    [Puljic] In case those "others" do not get involved, what  will happen?    [Silajdzic] I hope there will be negotiations, not war.    [Puljic] In conclusion, let me ask you whether the United  States intends to continue to firmly lead the initiative for  solving the Bosnian problem?    [Silajdzic] They definitely intend to do that. Many factors  decide on that and we are one of those factors. As I said, we  have been working on involving the United States in this  historic battle for the survival of Bosnia-Herzegovina for two  years. According to statements by their leaders, the Americans  will keep supporting Bosnia-Herzegovina. We hope they will keep  us in the family of democratic countries and nations, that we  will finally have a free country. There are many victims and,  unfortunately, we cannot bring back the dead, but I hope those  people did not die in vain.</p>

			<p><P> March 11, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NORTHRIDGE WOMEN ON THE BRINK OF A TITLE  </P> <P> Records were not the only things to fall on the third day of the NCAA Division  II swimming and diving championships at State University of New York, Buffalo.  </P> <P> So did the hopes of all but two teams.  </P> <P> Swimmers from teams other than Cal State Northridge and Cal State Bakersfield  can concentrate on individual achievements today, the meet's last day.  </P> <P> The team championships virtually have been decided.  </P> <P> Northridge holds a commanding 280-217 lead over second-place North Dakota State  in the women's standings, and some of the Lady Matadors' strongest events  remain.  </P> <P> Bakersfield, in quest of its fourth consecutive men's title, has an even bigger  lead, 422-314, over Oakland University (Mich.). Northridge is in seventh place  with 104 points.  </P> <P> Six Division II records were set Friday, including two by the Northridge  women's team, which is seeking its third championship in a row.  </P> <P> The Lady Matador team of Jude Kylander, Stacey Mettam, Michelle Sulak and Toady  Kimble started the night with a 1:34.83 effort in the 200-yard freestyle relay.  That broke the previous Division II standard of 1:35.58 set by North Dakota in  1985.  </P> <P> It was Mettam's 23.6 split on the second leg that put CSUN into the record  book.  </P> <P> "I have no idea where that came from," said the senior, who was competing in a  freestyle relay for the first time. Mettam's specialty is the backstroke.  </P> <P> Kimble, a legitimate sprinter, brought the Lady Matadors home with a time of  23.1 over the final 50 yards.  </P> <P> Mettam and Kylander were also members of a CSUN team that broke the 400-yard  medley relay record with a time of 3:52.64 in the last event of the night. The  previous mark was 3:54.17 set by Northridge last year.  </P> <P> Kylander swam an especially impressive 51.14 freestyle portion on the relay.  Mettam turned in a 58.7 in the backstroke, followed by Tina Schnare (1:04.63 in  the breaststroke) and Tina Dodson (58.17 in the butterfly).  </P> <P> Other records were set in the men's 200-yard freestyle relay (Oakland,  1:22.46); men's 400-yard medley relay (Oakland, 3:21.55); women's 400-yard  individual medley (Ann Wycoff of Army, 4:30.72); and the men's 400-yard  individual medley (Andrew Shattuck of Bakersfield, 3:57.73).  </P> <P> Among other highlights for the Northridge women's team was a high-scoring  finish in the 200-yard freestyle.  </P> <P> Kylander finished second in a personal-best 1:52.52. She was followed closely  by teammate Jeanna Giessinger, third in 1:53.32. Michelle Sulak of CSUN won the  event's consolation championship in 1:53.99.  </P> <P> Schnare can tie Wycoff, who swam her final event of the meet Friday -- for  career individual titles (eight) with a victory in the 200-yard breaststroke  today. Schnare, the top qualifier by more than two seconds, is also the  Division II record-holder in the event.  </P> <P> In the men's competition, Northridge junior Ted Hollahan failed to successfully  defend his championship in the 200-yard freestyle, finishing second in 1:38.71.  Hilton Woods, a sophomore from Oakland, came from half a body length behind in  the last 50 yards to out-touch Hollahan in 1:38.35.  </P> <P> Hollahan will have a chance to redeem himself against Woods -- who also  defeated him in the 50-yard freestyle -- in the 100-yard race today.  </P> <P> Hollahan won the event last year in a record-setting time of 44.65.  </P> <P> "What happened tonight might be the best thing for me," Hollahan said. "Now  I'll be shooting at someone again instead of everyone shooting at me."  </P></p>

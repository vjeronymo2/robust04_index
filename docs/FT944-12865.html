			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Veto on Slovenia expected Italy is expected to veto the opening of negotiations between the European Union and Slovenia on an association agreement at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg today. This follows Slovenian government repudiation of an agreement reached two weeks ago at Aquileia in Italy between the Italian and Slovenian foreign ministers. Mr Lojze Peterle, Slovenian foreign minister and leader of the Christian Democrat party, is due to step down today, having resigned in protest at what he considers a tendency of the Liberal Democrat party, led by prime minister Janez Drnovsek, to monopolise power. The Liberal Democrats objected to a clause in the Aquileia agreement whereby Slovenia undertook to draw up a list of real estate formerly belonging to Italian citizens and now in public ownership, with a view to giving former owners or their heirs the right to buy it back.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Yindi Loetcharoenchok] </F>   [Text] Lao leaders yesterday warmly welcomed investment  from Thailand, saying the landlocked nation is blessed with  abundant natural resources and economic potential which are  awaiting development that would be of mutual benefit.    At a conference in Vientiane yesterday, senior members of  the  Lao government spelt out a range of incentives to attract  foreign investment. They include foreign investment laws;  customs and taxation; flexible rules and regulations; and a  number of bilateral Lao-Thai economic and investment agreements,  such as agreements on trade and on investment promotion and  protection, as a basic guarantor to Thai investors.    While they expressed a strong desire to develop the  country's  natural resources to improve its ailing economy, they repeatedly  stressed that Laos' arts and culture, ecology and environment  will remain intact and well preserved.    The calls were made yesterday during a conference in  Vientiane on "The Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge: Economic and  Investment Prospects in the Lao PDR" which was organized by THE  NATION ahead of the official opening of the Mittraphap bridge  early next month. Lao PM's Office Minister Phao Bounnaphon  inaugurated the conference while Thai Deputy Prime Minister  Amnuai Wirawan gave a keynote speech on prospects for Lao-Thai  economic cooperation.    Phao said his country of 4.4 million people is full of  natural resources, and has stable political and social systems,  which are conducive for foreign investment. He called on Thai  business people to probe Laos' economic potential, especially in  the fields of agriculture and forestry, industry and services  for local and external needs. Laos' new market-oriented economic  policy, he said, has received full support from the private and  government sectors of friendly nations, especially Thailand  which "has warmly extended its assistance and cooperation" to  Laos.    Amnuai warned Thai businessmen and investors not to exploit  the resources in Laos or other neighboring countries for  short-term gains. He said traders and investors should always  bear in mind the "philosophy of cooperation," which purports  "mutual benefits" and "fairness in profit sharing" with host  countries. He said the cooperation should provide "sufficient  economic returns" to host countries including the transfer of  technology and management know-how so that they will eventually  stand on their own feet.    Lao-Thai cooperation will contribute and lead to broader  sub-regional and regional economic cooperation, which is  developing under the structure of the four northern Mekong-rim  countries in the Quadrangle Economic Cooperation and the  Association of the Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Amnuai said.    He said he believed the opening of the Lao-Thai Friendship  Bridge across the Mekong River by His Majesty the King on April  8 will set a new era of bilateral relations and cooperation.    About 250 people attended the conference yesterday at the  Lan  Xang Hotel, including 140 Thai businessmen and investors, about  30 representatives of the Lao private sector and officials from  various key Laos economic ministries.    Among the Lao delegates were six deputy ministers from key  economic ministries and offices who gave a broader perspective  of Laos' economic and investment potential and outlined national  foreign investment laws, incentives, rules and regulations.    Somphong Mongkhonvilai, vice president of the National  Committee for Planning and Cooperation (CPC), discussed Laos'  economic development plan towards the year 2000, while another  CPC vice president Leuan Sombounkhan talked about national  foreign investment policies.    Somphong said the new eight-year economic development plan  was implemented in February 1993 with the objective of boosting  the country's financial capital by developing its own natural  resources in the fields of minerals, hydropower, tourism,  agriculture and forestry, husbandry and human resources.    Rural development has been the government's priority in  order  to bridge the economic disparity and to distribute wealth to  provide better living conditions and standards around the  country, he said. Vientiane has set an economic growth target of  7-8 per cent annually.    Leuan said Laos is open to investors from around the world,  but that Thailand has an advantage due to its territorial  proximity and racial and cultural similarities.    He acknowledged several shortcomings that have hindered  economic growth, such as a shortage of capital markets,  manpower, lack of economic expertise and technology, and poor  management systems.    He described in detail an 11-point incentive program, which  Vientiane has introduced to attract prospective investors. They  include opening investment in all economic fields including  human resources in the fields of academia, education and  culture; protecting against nationalization; three different  forms of investment, from contract agreements to joint ventures,  or 100 percent foreign investment; full repatriation of personal  and corporate assets; freedom from government intervention in  investments; recruitment of foreign labor and human resources;  repatriation of profits; and a certain period of relaxation of  income and profit taxes and the establishment of a "one-stop  service" to facilitate investments.    Four other Lao ministers gave a good perspective of  investment in Laos. They stressed that Vientiane has pursued an  economic policy of sustainable development for mutual benefits  with the aim of protecting its culture, social structure,  environment and ecology.</p>

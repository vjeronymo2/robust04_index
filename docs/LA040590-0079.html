			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BUTCHER: NEW CAJUN DISHES HEAD YOUR WAY  </P> <P> I spent a wonderful week in Cajun country Louisiana not long ago eating my way  into blissful oblivion on gumbo, jambalaya, crawfish and crab. It was the first  time I had visited Louisiana, outside of New Orleans, since many years ago when  chef Paul Prudhomme took me to visit "his people" back in the mid 1970s.  </P> <P> There have been a few changes in Louisiana cuisine since then. New products  have been developed and are being developed that are adding new excitement to  an already exciting traditional Cajun and Creole cuisine.  </P> <P> When I first came to Louisiana in the mid '70s, for example, alligator had just  been taken off the endangered species list and hunting them was legal (under  very controlled conditions) during September. Many creative cooks in that part  of the world began experimenting with alligator meat.  </P> <P> Alligator etouffe, alligator soup and alligator sausage are among the alligator  dishes that became popular. A demand for alligator developed and a few  enterprising entrepreneurs began farm-raising gators. This year they will  harvest more than 75,000 farm-raised alligators.  </P> <P> Alligator has not yet become a standard in the meat markets of America, but  with the interest in Cajun and Creole food well established in this country, it  probably won't be long before you run into alligator everywhere.  </P> <P> Another new Louisiana treat that will very likely soon be seen on the menus of  fine restaurants everywhere is soft-shell crawfish, not soft-shell crabs, those  are old hat. Soft-shell crawfish are something rather recent to Cajun-Creole  cuisine.  </P> <P> It wasn't until they started farm-raising crawfish in the mid 1980s that this  delicacy began appearing on menus in south Louisiana. The crawfish molt four  times a year and in the process, for a brief period, are left with a new soft  shell. That new shell begins to harden very soon; but if harvested immediately  after molting and quickly frozen, the shell remains soft and totally edible  just like the soft-shell crab. I had them for the first time at Ralph &amp;  Kacoo's, a restaurant in Baton Rouge. They were fantastic.  </P> <P> Again, it will be a while before these are available in the frozen food case of  a local super, but considering the interest in Cajun-Creole cooking in America  and the support that the Louisiana Dept. of Agriculture and Louisiana State  University give to aquaculture in the state, soft-shell crawfish could soon be  a leading export.  </P> <P> One of Louisiana's leading exports in recent years has been chef John D. Folse,  C.E.C. Folse has been instrumental in bringing the cuisine of Louisiana to  international recognition. Together with Prudhomme, Folse has taken Cajun  dishes to all parts of the world: Beijing in 1986; Paris in 1987; Moscow in  1988, and Italy last year.  </P> <P> One of the highlights of my recent trip to Baton Rouge was spending an  afternoon with Folse at his White Oak plantation. He generously prepared a  variety of Cajun-Creole specialties for me to try: cochan de lait roast  suckling pig cooked over an open fire, alligator sausage with crawfish butter,  and a marvelous char-broiled pork tenderloin with Louisiana cane syrup.  </P> <P> Pork tenderloins are available everywhere, packaged two to a vacuum package.  And Louisiana cane syrup can be found in any well-stocked supermarket or food  specialty store.  </P> <P> CHAR-BROILED PORK TENDERLOIN WITH CANE SYRUP SAUCE  </P> <P> 2 pork tenderloins  </P> <P> 1/4 cup Port  </P> <P> 1/2 cup Louisiana cane syrup  </P> <P> 1/4 cup cracked black pepper  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon dried basil  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon dried tarragon  </P> <P> Cane Syrup Sauce  </P> <P> Wipe pork tenderloins dry with paper towel. Place in glass dish and add Port,  syrup, pepper, salt, thyme, basil and tarragon. Rub marinade well into meat and  let stand at room temperature 20 to 30 minutes.  </P> <P> Grill meat over coals in covered grill 20 to 30 minutes. Don't overcook.  Internal temperature should be about 150 degrees, meat should be juicy and just  past pink. Slice thin on bias and serve with Cane Syrup Sauce. Makes 6  servings.  </P> <P> Cane Syrup Sauce  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons butter  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons finely minced onion  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon finely minced garlic  </P> <P> 1/4 cup Port  </P> <P> 1/4 cup beef broth  </P> <P> 1/4 cup Louisiana cane syrup  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon cracked black pepper  </P> <P> Melt butter over medium high heat in heavy saucepan. Saute onion and garlic  until tender, about 3 minutes.  </P> <P> Add Port and broth and cook to reduce to approximately 1/2 volume. Add syrup,  salt, cayenne and black pepper and continue to cook until sauce is slightly  thickened and all flavors are well incorporated. Makes about 1 cup.  </P> <P> Note: 1 to 2 teaspoons arrowroot dissolved in equal amount of water may be  stirred in to achieve slightly thicker consistency, if desired.  </P></p>

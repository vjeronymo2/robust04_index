			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Why Washington ducked a court fight with GM: Both sides save face in saga of fuel tanks Last Friday's settlement between General Motors and the US Department of Transportation, whereby the government dropped its attempts to recall allegedly unsafe GM pickup trucks in exchange for GM spending Dollars 51m (Pounds 32.6m) on road safety, is clearly designed to let both sides off the hook. It extricates the transportation secretary, Mr Federico Pena, from a case which looked increasingly unwinnable in court and saves GM the public relations disaster of an official hearing. For the car industry, the deal has broad significance. Between 1973 and 1987, GM sold some 9m large pickups with the fuel tank mounted outside the main frame, thus allowing a bigger tank and longer range. The trucks passed the necessary safety tests at the time; but it has since been argued that they are more likely to catch fire in a side-on collision than trucks by other makers. The government started to investigate two years ago. In October, Mr Pena upped the stakes sharply by moving to recall the trucks. They had caused 150 more deaths than would have been caused by Fords, he said, and statistically were liable to cause 32 more. What really alarmed the car industry was the idea that it could be retrospectively liable for vehicles passed as safe when sold. 'Meeting a safety standard,' Mr Pena said, 'does not absolve a manufacturer of its responsibility to produce safe vehicles.' GM had become aware the trucks were defective, he said, adding that the management 'appeared to have made a decision favouring sales over safety'. GM hotly disputed the allegations and still does. 'These trucks are as safe as the comparable Ford or Dodge,' a spokesman said yesterday, 'and far safer than any passenger car.' The immediate commercial risk to GM was minor. By US law, vehicles cannot be recalled more than eight years after sale. The risk was thus restricted to the 350,000 or so models sold in 1987. More important, GM faces between 50 and 60 civil suits on behalf of accident victims. Only seven cases have come to court so far, with GM winning three and losing three and the seventh due for retrial. The fact that the government has dropped its case now means, says GM, that none of Mr Pena's earlier statements are admissible in court. Politically, Friday's settlement looks an undoubted embarrassment for Mr Pena. His officials deny he was acting under duress from the White House or the Department of Justice. Rumours have been rife, however, that President Bill Clinton disliked the prospect of a battle with GM in which his administration would appear as the heavy-handed regulator, just as a new Republican Congress arrives in Washington. Mr Pena is already under fierce attack from anti-GM lobbyists. The Victims' Committee to Recall GM Pickups calls the settlement a 'public bribe' and 'a sentence of death for hundreds more Americans'. The Center for Auto Safety is going ahead with a parade of burn victims on Capitol Hill today. But Mr Pena had such a weak hand that the deal could have been worse. His staff at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration had repeatedly told him the case was not in their view winnable in court because the trucks did not pose an 'unreasonable risk'. In addition, NHTSA staff estimated that even if the Transportation Department did win a recall of the trucks, it would take around five years of litigation and save only six to nine lives. The NHTSA estimates that one small part of the money being spent by GM under the settlement - the purchase of 200,000 car seats for babies to be distributed free to low income families - will save 50 lives and prevent around 5,000 injuries. Mr Stephen Kaplan, a Transportation Department official, said Mr Pena had made his decision 'in a public interest mindset'. The deal, he said, 'will save hundreds and hundreds more lives than any other option available to him'.</p>

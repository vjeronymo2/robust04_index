Treaties between the postcommunist  countries should be adjusted in the same way," said Henning  Christophersen, vice president of the European Union, at a  meeting of the European Banking Forum in Prague yesterday.  Should the contrary be the case, Europe may find after yet  another integration that it has to face several hundreds of  incompatible bilateral treaties.    The European Union decided last summer that it would support  the multilateral aspect of treaties, and the EU foreign  ministers established that they would invite their Eastern  colleagues for cooperation. The EU finance ministers also  arrived at an identical conclusion on Monday evening [21 March],  Christophersen stressed.    Euro treaties are expected to greatly liberalize mutual  relations, and the establishment of a free trade zone should  become the main objective before full membership is assumed, the  vice president added. Despite the needed rapprochement of  economic policies, the East European countries should not make  the same mistake as the European Union--that is, introduce a  vast system of state supports and subsidies.    We can see that the European Union is hesitating about its  expansion, Christophersen said. Questions are being raised  regarding the pressure exerted by the competitors, the  decisionmaking process in such a large group, agricultural  policy, and structural funds [strukturalni fondy]. According to  him, the countries of Central and East Europe are also  hesitating to a certain extent. They have to sort out problems  with meeting EU social and ecological standards, carrying out  economic conversion, the functioning of democracy, respecting  minority rights, and introducing the EU legal system. Both  sides should stop hesitating and avoiding problems,  Christophersen stressed. According to him, the European Union  was not established in the 1950's because the member countries  loved each other but because it was necessary, in view of the  failure of diplomatic structures.</p>

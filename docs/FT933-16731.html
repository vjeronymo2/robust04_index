			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Ballot to be held over rail sell-off DELEGATES at the RMT rail union's annual conference yesterday voted unanimously to ballot the union's membership on industrial action over rail privatisation, Diane Summers writes. Talks between the union and British Rail, focusing on pay and conditions, will be held next month. The industrial action ballot is likely to be conducted later in the year if the talks do not satisfy the union, RMT warned. BR said it would discuss with the union 'at every stage any changes that will be made and we hope they will join us in those discussions'.</p>

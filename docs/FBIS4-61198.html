			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by KYRGYZKABAR correspondent Albert Bogdanov for </F> TASS]    [Text] Bishkek, 4 May -- The talks on ways to settle the  Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh began today in  Kyrgyzstan's capital in the atmosphere of latent tension. The  sides were ready to take issue on any minor point. Since  Nagorno-Karabakh representatives were absent from the reception  staged by President Askar Akayev before the start of the talks  and its delegation did not get an opportunity to state its  position at the morning session, one can understand the harsh  assessment of the conference from Karen Baburyan, acting  chairman of Armenia's Supreme Soviet, who said: "It could not be  worse. If they make some decisions without Nagorno-Karabakh,  all right, let them. But who then is to return the conquered  territories?"    The first to speak was deputy chairman of Azerbaijan's  Supreme Soviet Afiyaddin Dzhalilov, who categorically demanded  an immediate cease-fire and the withdrawal of troops from the  occupied territories.    The Armenian side reacted negatively to the fact that the  chairman of Azerbaijan's Supreme Soviet did not turn up and that  the meeting was attended by his deputy instead. [Armenian]  Parliament Speaker Babken Ararktsyan stated in no uncertain  terms that this strongly undermined the authority of the present  meeting. He said it is hard to understand why Azerbaijan has  not accepted measures proposed by Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh  to settle the conflict, even though it is to receive territories  in return. He reiterated the words of President Levon  Ter-Petrosyan, contained in his message to the participants in  the talks, to the effect that the sides' frequently repeated  statements about peace do not bring peace and quiet to the area.</p>

			<p><P> February 26, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> TREVINO'S DAUGHTER WINS, TOO  </P> <P> Lee Trevino's putting has given a big boost to his daughter's driving.  </P> <P> Trevino capped another lucrative weekend on the Senior PGA Tour by rolling in a  15-foot birdie putt Sunday on the final hole of the Chrysler Cup to win a new  LeBaron convertible.  </P> <P> The car went to the player with the lowest final round. Trevino tied Don Bies  for the honor with a 3-under-par 69 and won the contest because he birdied No.  18, the tiebreaker hole.  </P> <P> Easy come, easy go. The hottest player in golf said he'll give away the car.  </P> <P> "I've got all the Toyotas in the world," said Trevino, who does commercials for  the Japanese auto maker. "I've got a daughter, Lesley -- 23 years old, and  she's never asked me for a thing. I think my daughter needs this car real bad."  </P></p>

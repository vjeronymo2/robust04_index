			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs warn on risks of rail privatisation THE COMMONS transport committee yesterday labelled the government's rail privatisation plans 'novel and untested' and warned that they could go badly wrong. The committee's final report on the government's proposals said investment was more important to the railways' future than whether they were privatised. But MPs stopped short of condemning the privatisation plans outright, saying they might hold the potential for an improved system. 'Rail users will be the final judge of whether the legislation currently before the House succeeds in maintaining the opportunities for private profit,' they concluded. A hostile report had been expected because the transport committee is chaired by anti-privatisation Conservative MP Mr Robert Adley. But the strongest criticisms appear to have been toned down to secure the backing of other Conservative members. The report broadly approves the government's plans for rail freight privatisation but expresses reservations about the idea of open access to the tracks for competing passenger-train operators and the separation of ownership of the tracks and trains. It says budgetary constraints could lead to line closures. The committee says no comparable railway in the world has adopted the form of privatisation proposed for the UK. 'This does not of itself mean that it cannot succeed,' the report says. 'What it does mean is that because of the lack of previous experience to draw upon, the risk that something could go badly wrong is that much higher.' Mr Roger Freeman, public transport minister, said there was no reason why any services should close as a result of privatisation. 'The only services that will close, and I am sure that will happen, are those that close because of lack of passenger demand. But I don't want to go down in history as the junior minister who was the grandson of Beeching.' Mr Freeman said many of the other criticisms had been overtaken by events and he undertook to respond to the others before the Railways Bill reached report stage. Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, said the MPs' report showed that the nation would end up with 'a lawyers' paradise and a passengers' hell'. The government plans to press ahead with a bill to privatise London's buses as part of a strategy to put consumer choice and deregulation at the heart of its next legislative programme. Whitehall officials said yesterday that Mr MacGregor had secured a place for the bill in the programme for the Queen's Speech which will be endorsed by the cabinet tomorrow.

			<p>BFN     [Text] London, Apr. 20 (MAP) -- In an exclusive interview  with the London-based monthly EUROMONEY, Moroccan Finance  Minister Mohamed Sagou outlined the four principal themes that  dominates his thinking. In the interview to be published in  the May's magazine supplement, the minister talked about the  Moroccan Government's policy to restructure and modernize  economy, fiscal and monetary policies, relations with the  European Union [EU], the privatisation program and moves to  create more job opportunities. To a question on the state's  priorities to restructure and modernize its economy, the finance  minister listed four priorities: The state's new role [words  indistinct] the economy, speeding up the liberalization of the  financial sector to become more competitive and attractive to  the European Union's partners and social problems, particularly  unemployment, in addition to the acceleration of new policy of  taking many state-financed activities off-budget.    The minister also explained that a new strategy has been  devised to deal with social problems and that the government is  ready to make some concessions as long as they don't threaten  the basic stability Morocco has attained.    On relations with the European Union, Sagou pointed out that  two-thirds of Morocco's foreign trade is conducted with the EU  and 800,000 Moroccan migrant workers--80 percent of the  total--are employed there. Similarly, 80 percent of all foreign  investment in Morocco comes from EU countries.    In northern Morocco, especially around Tangier, he  explained,  Spanish companies have established assembly plants comparable to  the U.S. enterprises operating just south of the Mexican border.  He however conceded that the GATT agreement might threaten  Morocco's relatively privileged position with the European Union  by effectively enabling other countries to export to the EU  under the same conditions.    To a question voicing fears that the quest to attract  foreign  investment may open the way to undue foreign ownership and  influence, the Moroccan minister answered that right now only 4  percent of Morocco's gross capital formation is of foreign  provenance. We have a comfortable absorptive margin for the  next ten years, though in sectors like banking and insurance  foreign interests can already acquire control of [word  indistinct] enterprises, he added.    On the Kingdom's fiscal system and the informal sector, he  said personal and corporate tax rates have been reduced for four  or five years, and over the next four or five years, individuals  and companies will be encouraged to declare their tax liability.  But viewed pragmatically, the informal economy is creating jobs  and wealth, he explained.    To a question on how the government will simultaneously  finance increased social spending and reduce tax revenues,  without plunging the state's finances back into serious deficit,  he replied that "global budget deficit is only about 2.2 percent  of gross domestic product against 13 percent in 1983.    In figures it amounts to around USD 600 million, a mere USD  25 million over last year. We are confident that lower taxes  will actually increase fiscal revenues by encouraging more  people to pay up, and by increasing company profits in the long  term. Receipts from privatisation sales will also bridge the  gap, though that is not the motive behind our privatisation  campaign. We are prepared to seek external financing but only  for the private sector.    The government has declined offers from London and New York  bankers to raise loans in excess of USD 100 million, and  suggested they fund our private sector instead. Growth will  bring in revenue long term, and in the short term we shall  proceed cautiously step by step with necessary fiscal expansion.  Meanwhile, we hope to get the private sector to take more of  the budgetary strain in sectors like agriculture, energy,  infrastructure and even education. In areas like public  housing, which we shall continue to subsidize, falling interest  rates will lessen the state's burden.    The minister outlined that the biggest problem is creating  more jobs for Moroccan growing population and bringing down  unemployment, a problem which solution he described as "the key  to everything."</p>

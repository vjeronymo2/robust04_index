			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 24 May (ITAR-TASS) -- Russian Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin and Douglas Hurd, British secretary of state  for foreign and Commonwealth affairs, discussed mainly economic  issues at a meeting this morning.    Viktor Chernomyrdin informed the British minister about the  package of decrees on stepping up structural transformations in  the Russian economy, which were prepared by the government and  signed by President Boris Yeltsin Monday. They are designed, in  particular, to optimize the government's taxation policy and  attract foreign and Russian capital investments.    Douglas Hurd, for his part, noted that after meeting with  British businessmen in Moscow he arrived at the conclusion that  business people in his country take an extremely optimistic view  with regard to the prospects for economic cooperation between  Russia and Britain. Douglas Hurd confirmed the invitation given  by British Prime Minister John Major to Viktor Chernomyrdin to  visit London officially at the end of 1994 or the beginning of  1995.</p>

			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / UK Company News: National Express offer oversubscribed Strong interest from private investors has led to an oversubscription of the offer for sale of shares in National Express, Britain's biggest coach company. Details of the allocation will be announced today, but it is likely that some applications, particularly the larger ones, will have to be scaled down.

			<p>Narcotics   Control Strategy Report  <H4>  Panama's National Bank General Manager Says Money Laundering </H4> Charges `Unfair'   <F P=102> PA1104192494 Panama City Telemetro Television Network in  Spanish 1738 GMT 11 Apr 94 </F>  <F P=103> PA1104192494 </F> <F P=104>  Panama City Telemetro Television Network </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN   <F P=106> [From the ``Telemetro Reports'' newscast] </F>   [Text] National Bank of Panama General Manager Luis Horacio  Moreno said that the money-laundering charges made by the United  States against Panama are unfair and that the biggest money  launderers are in the United States. Luis H. Moreno refuses to  accept the conclusions of a U.S. report, which states that the  Panamanian Government has implemented several measures to reduce  the risks involved in misusing the Panamanian banking center.    [Begin Moreno recording] Bankers in the National  Banking Association, among whom I count myself as a  representative of the National Bank of Panama, have done and  continue to do everything possible to reduce the incidence and  risk of misuse of our services in the form of money laundering.  We have not done it because the United States asked us to or  because we want to qualify for a loan, but because we are  convinced that attacking and fighting money laundering is a  patriotic duty. In so doing, we are also fighting drug  trafficking, one of the worst plagues of our time, which  jeopardizes our young people and our entire community. That is  the real reason; it is not to qualify as one of the good little  boys.    All we want is to fulfill our patriotic duty. This  government has carried out innumerable actions and made great  effort that have been unacknowledged until now. Beginning in  March 1990 we took effective steps to control cash deposits at  banks. Since then and for the last four years, Panama has  implemented an incredible number of controls such as that last  measure you just mentioned: declaring the amount of cash one is  bringing into the country when going through customs, which is  something many other countries do. We will continue to do so,  because this is not something that will go away with two, three,  or even 100 measures. The United States, which is the  qualifying party, launders the most money in the world. The  United States invests tens of billions of dollars each year and  they have still been unable to do solve the problem. [end  recording]</p>

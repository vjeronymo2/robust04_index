It is not accidental 1994 starts with a state visit of the  U.S. President to Moscow. Both sides have always considered  their bilateral relations a priority of their foreign political  concepts. Comprehensive trade and economic cooperation with the  U.S. is especially important for Russia at a period of profound  changes.    Moscow's consistent course at cooperation and partnership  with Washington is obvious; claims of some mass media bodies  that Russia no longer considers its relations with the U.S. to  be a priority are unjustified.    The U.S. partners will, certainly, be interested in the  recent political events in Russia, primarily the results of  parliament elections. The world was somewhat alarmed with these  results although they should hardly be exaggerated or dramatized.    The U.S. delegation headed by Bill Clinton will study the  situation on the spot and get acquainted with the essence of the  reform policy carried out by the Yeltsin team. In the words of  Bill Clinton, he is a staunch supporter of Boris Yeltsin. The  visit will help them to understand Russian society has much work  to do.    The recent personnel changes in the U.S. Administration,  primarily the appointment of First Undersecretary of State and  Coordinator of the U.S. Policy on Russia and the Commonwealth of  Independent States Strobe Talbott, testifies to the enhancement  of the "Russian factor" in the U.S. foreign policy.    The Russian diplomatic community has estimated these changes  as very positive. "Washington promotes people who have  imagination," believes a high-ranking Russian diplomat. In his  opinion, Moscow will take adequate steps after the summit.    The Moscow summit will also focus on security, cooperation  in  arms control and non-proliferation of nuclear arms and key  international issues, including settlement of regional conflicts.    It is expected to be extremely saturated and elaborate a  program of partnership and interaction for the rest of the  20th-early 21st century.</p>

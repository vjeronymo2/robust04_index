			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 10 KYODO -- An open bidding system will  be introduced in April for state-ordered public works projects,  according to a draft of the action program to open Japan's  construction market.    The draft, obtained Monday [10 January] by KYODO NEWS  SERVICE, said the step will be implemented from April "as much  as possible" for public works projects sponsored by the central  government and 85 public corporations, including the Japan  Highway Public Corporation.    Under the current system, only designated contractors are  allowed to participate in bidding for most public works  projects, a practice which has drawn much fire from the United  States.    Although the draft action program failed to specify the  scale  of projects which are subject to open bidding, it indicated that  the minimum scale is 850 million yen if they are state-ordered.    But the draft did not come up with a clear answer to a U.S.  request for bringing down the size of projects sponsored by  local governments which will be put to open bidding.    The Japanese Government has proposed the threshold be 2.85  billion yen.    The draft action program was submitted to a meeting of four  concerned cabinet ministers earlier in the day before being  reported to Prime Minister Morihiro hosokawa.    It will be approved at a cabinet meeting on January 18,  which  will fulfill a Japanese pledge made last October to hammer out  such a program early this year.    The pledge was made in a bid to avert yet another trade row  with the U.S., which has threatened to retaliate if Japan fails  to take steps to increase foreign access to its construction  market by October 31.    The Japanese move helped soften the U.S. stance, persuading  it to extend the original deadline to January 20.    The draft plan has been worked out mostly on the basis of  recommendations made late December by a government advisory body.    As to public works projects concerning designing and  consulting services, areas in which the U.S. has shown  particular interest, the plan calls for the introduction of a  half-open bidding system under which contractors selected in  advance for their technological and other abilities will be  qualified to place tenders.    Government sources said designing and consulting works which  will be covered by the plan will be worth 85 million yen or more.    To prevent rigging and other types of malpractice, the  program proposed the drafting by the Fair Trade Commission  (FTC), the nation's antitrust watchdog, of guidelines on bidding  by the coming summer.    Under the plan, a cabinet-affiliated body will deal with  complaints about bidding procedures and results.    The program, however, failed to touch upon a proposal to  halt  preferential treatment as agreed bilaterally in 1988 for U.S.  contractors in bidding for Japan's major public works projects.    The sources said the failure to deal with the problem is due  to differences in opinion among government officials.</p>

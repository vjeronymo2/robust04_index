			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / It's no game on London's monopoly board: Plans to reform Britain's property laws threaten the capital's largest residential estates Behind the facades of London's most prestigious addresses, an acrimonious dispute has erupted. On one side are the ground landlords, often from aristocratic families, who have retained large tracts of their ancestral estates in spite of war, laws and taxes. Some parts of central London resemble a monopoly board, with the best streets and squares owned by individual players. On the other side are their leaseholders. They have often lived in their houses for decades and regard them as their own. But frequently their tenure is troubled by fraught negotiations with their landlords over repairs and renewal of leases. The resentment harboured by leaseholders has prompted a public airing of grievances. The Leasehold Enfranchisement Association, a lobby group, says many tenants have been reduced 'to an unacceptable point of distress and potential homelessness'. It has just completed a critical review of the great estates - the land owned by private landlords - such as the Grosvenor Estate, Cadogan Estate, Ilchester Estate and the Smith's Charity Estate in South Kensington. It concluded that the great estates' 'commercial sophistication and bloated mercantile size (was) based on local housing monopolies and virtually nil public accountability'. 'Leaseholders,' it said, 'have been the victims of a long-running feat of legerdemain kept in motion by the repressive techniques of managing agents.' The rise of tension between landlord and leaseholder is the result of legislation - scheduled to be enacted next summer - that will force most landowners to sell their freeholds to leaseholders. The change in the law would close a long chapter in the history of London's property market. The 'building lease', which was created more than 300 years ago, has played a crucial role in shaping the capital. By keeping the freehold of their land and letting plots to builders for a specified term, landlords could keep tight control over the quality of buildings. From Bloomsbury to Belgravia, the grandiose estates of central London are the legacy of the building lease. Pressure for leasehold reform first arose in the second half of the 19th century, when many of the long leases granted in the property expansion of the 18th century fell due. But it was not until 1967 that leasehold enfranchisement became a reality. A bill granted leaseholders the right to buy the freeholds of their houses. However, the Leasehold Reform Act excluded property with high rateable values, and thus many of the houses belonging to the great estates. The omission was a product of intense lobbying by large, private landowners. One of the more curious arguments used against comprehensive leasehold enfranchisement was the Cadogan Estate's threat to halt a redevelopment programme of 65 acres of Chelsea. 'The effect would be to drive us, and others like us, out of the country into speculative development overseas,' said Earl Cadogan in 1967. Despite winning the desired concession, the plan to rebuild Chelsea was dropped. A stronger argument used against leasehold enfranchisement was that it interfered with the right of a private citizen to own and enjoy his private property. The Duke of Westminster, owner of the Grosvenor Estate, felt so strongly that he took his case to the European Court of Human Rights. But the Court found against him. 'The compulsory transfer of property from one individual to another might constitute a legitimate means for promoting the public interest,' it concluded. 'The enhancement of social justice within the community could properly be described as being in the public interest.' Now the tide is moving even further against landowners. The rights of leaseholders are, once again, to be extended at the expense of landlords, because of the predicament of flat dwellers who were excluded from the 1967 act. The government has decided to enfranchise flat owners, because building societies are unwilling to grant mortgages on the increasingly short leases that date back to the flat conversions in the 1960s. Since the white paper, expected this autumn, will not include any restrictions on the value of flats eligible for enfranchisement, the government has also decided to remove the value restrictions on houses from the 1967 Leasehold Reform Act. Once again, the large landowners have tried to defend their right to their estates. Mr Jeremy Newsum, chief executive of Grosvenor Estate, says the government's proposals 'amount to a massive infringement of two long-standing democratic principles: the right for a private citizen to own and enjoy his private property as he wishes, and to uphold contracts freely entered into'. This view is shared by many Tory backbenchers. In a debate in the Commons earlier this year, Mr William Benyon, then MP for Milton Keynes, said that the closest parallel to such an arbitrary transfer of property from one sector of the population to another was the dissolution of the monasteries in the 16th century. The large estates also believe that the maintenance and character of historic London is at stake. The Grosvenor Estate argues that, without its involvement, the appearance of Mayfair and Belgravia would be threatened. This argument wins little sympathy from the advocates of reform, who say that owner-occupiers take better care of property. The Leasehold Enfranchisement Association maintains that, by the time the Grosvenor Estate sold its Pimlico property, it was already dilapidated and the subject of brothel prosecutions. Perhaps the strongest element of the leaseholders' case is that, while the freeholder provided the land, it was usually the leaseholder who built the house on the land and bore the costs of improvements and maintenance. The ground landlord did not even take any risk in the building of their estates. Speculative developers made the investments and frequently suffered losses as a result. The Adam Brothers, the 18th century developers, nearly went bankrupt when they failed to let houses they built at the Adelphi. The Duke of St Albans, who had given them a 99-year lease, lost nothing. This was the overriding justification for leasehold enfranchisement in 1967. The white paper for that act criticised the unfairness of a system in which the landlord kept full ownership of a house built on his land at the end of its lease. A quarter of a century later, debate on the issue has lost none of its fervour. But the current moves for reform may well represent the final act. After hundreds of years of stewardship, London's biggest landowners are likely to be faced with the break-up of their estates.</p>

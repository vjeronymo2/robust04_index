			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Gardening: Essence of Austin and the English rose - Gardening Books Gertrude Stein, ever the philosopher, rammed her message home. A rose, she wrote in 1913, 'is a rose is a rose is a rose'. You can hardly fail to see her point, but I cannot help feeling she was not a gardener. For gardeners there have always been roses and roses. For some, for example, the essence of a rose is the long pointed bud, the often startling colours and the up-right habit of the Hybrid Tea. For others this is near anathema. They will accept, maybe, the luxuriance of a floribunda but really think a rose is nothing if it did not begin life as a Gallica, Damask or Moss, or perhaps a Bourbon, China or Musk. In the long, fashion-based debate about roses - fed for at least 200 years by the dedicated work of rose growers and breeders - David Austin must have an honoured place. For a full 40 years Austin has sought to achieve a new class of rose. Now a sumptuous new book, David Austin's English Roses (Conran Octopus, Pounds 18.99, 160 pages) - together with the evidence in his own nursery and in increasing numbers of gardens across the land - show that he is well on the way. True, as he is careful to acknowledge, his roses are not yet accepted by the World Federation of Rose Societies as a new class. But, he clearly hopes, so distinct is the English Rose from its predecessors or progenitors, that it will merit this distinction. The essence of Austin's English Rose is that it combines the beautiful form, gentle colours and rich scent of the old roses of the 18th and 19th centuries with the repeat-flowering, vigour and disease-resistant qualities of the modern hybrid teas and floribundas. Put like that it sounds as though it was simple to produce these new roses. But, in one of his most fascinating chapters (strangely relegated to the book's end) Austin tells how 'in a typical year we cross-fertilise 30,000 roses to produce approximately 50,000 seedlings'. These are progressively reduced and selected and probably cross-bred again until, at the end of about eight years 'we hope to have five or six good roses that will form new varieties for commercial introduction'. One of these varieties, 'of a warm pink colouring and strong and upright growth,' was introduced in 1988 and called Financial Times Centenary, to mark that event. Austin does not reveal its precise parentage, but his book includes a splendidly detailed and illustrated catalogue of about 60 varieties ranging from the apricot pink Ambridge Rose to the 'Gallica-like' crimson rose William Shakespeare and the 'almost indestructible' Wife of Bath. There is much else besides in Austin's delectable work, from a history of the rose to tips on pruning, to make it a must. A good compliment to Austin's book is Gardening With Old Roses. Written by New Zealand authors Alan Sinclair and Rosemary Thodey, it is published in the UK by Cassell (Pounds 16.99, 185 pages). While the historical, descriptive and 'rose care' sections are adequate, the chapters on the use of roses, companion planting and so forth are especially good, as are the photographs. I found another Cassells publication, The Complete Book of Roses by John Mattock and others (Pounds 20, 208 pages), less satisfactory. However, it does cover hybrid tea and other modern roses; it is more comprehensive than the New Zealand book (although less well-illustrated), and it has a good chapter on rose breeding. My next two books, if not quite in the same league as Austin, describe a type of gardening which relies heavily on the rose breeder's craft. Create a Cottage Garden - Recipes for Borders, Beds and Containers (Michael Joseph, Pounds 17.99, 189 pages) employs a contrived format. Its author, Kathleen Brown, devises 'recipes' for planting schemes - for example, The Scented Tunnel or the May Queen Arbour or a Cheerful Shady Porch and then gives a list of 'ingredients' followed by descriptions and instructions under headings such as site, scale, plan (for planting), method and after-care. But if the drawings (no photographs) are rather twee, there are plenty of roses and many ideas especially useful for beginner gardeners. Wendy Lauderdale's Garden at Ashtree Cottage, by contrast, has photographs (by Andrew Lawson) almost as luscious as those of Clay Perry for David Austin. Lauderdale's tale (Weidenfeld and Nicholson, Pounds 14.99, 128 pages) is of a National Trust-owned cottage to which she moved in the early 1980s when both house and garden seemed 'folorn, neglected and unloved'. What I liked especially are the photographs taken at precise points in the garden at different seasons. I know I am not the only amateur gardener to find it hard to visualise in spring what one's planting scheme will look like in full summer or autumn - let alone in winter. Which leads me to declare an interest. In 10 years of having my own garden, I have come to believe increasingly that if a garden looks good in the winter, making it look good for the rest of the year is a relatively easy task. And making a garden look good in winter cheers you up, for it takes you through not just the gloomiest, coldest months of December, January and often February but the fag end of autumn and the grey days of early spring as well. Yet where are the books on winter gardening? With the noble exception of Rosemary Verey's excellent The Garden in Winter (published in 1988 by Frances Lincoln) they are very hard to find. I can claim no credit (for I have long taken issue with him on his early addiction to conifers) that my brother, Adrian Bloom, has produced a volume to help fill the gap. Winter Garden Glory (Harper Collins, Pounds 14.99, 144 pages) is subtitled 'How to get the best from your garden from Autumn through to Spring', and while it does make considerable use of various conifer species to increase winter interest, it covers much else. Evergreens, grasses, winter flowering or berrying or bright-stemmed plants and trees and early and late bulbs can all enhance the garden in winter and lift the spirit, whether they be in grand or structured planting schemes or in containers in the backyard. There are lots of good photos, detailed planting plans and a plant directory in Winter Gardening Glory too. How could I not commend it?</p>

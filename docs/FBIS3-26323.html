Both sides reached a  consensus on the following issues:    1. Both sides believe that ARATS and SEF should avoid  political issues in a practical attitude when holding talks on  routine affairs. Both sides have discussed three topics on  routine affairs, including the "Repatriation of Personnel Who  Have Entered Into the Area of the Other Side in Violation of  Relevant Regulations, and Related Issues," and have reached a  high degree of consensus, but they still should make efforts to  iron out certain differences so as to reach an agreement in  writing as soon as possible. Both sides have decided through  consultation to hold the fourth round of talks on routine  affairs in Beijing in late March and have decided that, after an  agreement is reached in the talks, it will be signed by ARATS  and SEF responsible persons in Taibei [Taipei]. During the  fourth round of talks on routine affairs, both sides will  exchange views or hold discussions on "Joint Operations Against  Smuggling, Robbery, and Other Criminal Activities at Sea,"  "Cross-Strait Protection for Intellectual Property Rights  (Intelligence Property Rights)," "Cross-Strait Contacts and  Assistance Between Related Law Courts (Mutual Assistance Between  Judicial Organs on Both Sides of the Taiwan Strait)," and  certain economic, scientific, and technological topics included  in the "Joint Agreement Reached by Wang-Gu [Ku] Talks."    2. Both sides have decided through consultation on the  "Measures Facilitating the Entry and Exit by ARATS and SEF  Affairs Working Personnel," and have decided to implement them  by treating the exchange of correspondences through mail as  taking effect.    3. Both sides have agreed in principle to increase the  categories of copies of notarization documents according to the  second article of the "Cross-Strait Agreement on the  Verification of Notarization Documents." Specific items will be  decided upon through another consultation.    4. Both sides are willing to assist each other on issues  relating to the Cross-Strait inheritance of property.    5. Both sides have agreed they will continue to promote the  activities of mutual visits by responsible persons of the media,  reporters, and scientific and technological personnel as well as  the exchange of teenager.    Both sides will continue to implement all the agreements  reached by the "Wang-Gu talks," maintain a smooth channel for  ARATS-SEF contacts and talks, and create favorable conditions  for the second "Wang-Gu talks."</p>

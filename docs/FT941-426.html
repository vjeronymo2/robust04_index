			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Arts: Extra space will be boon to Edinburgh The new Festival Theatre in Edinburgh will make a welcome impact on the city's international arts festival this year, writes Martin Hoyle. The new space will make it possible to present two blockbusters: the return of the Mark Morris Dance Group in L'Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato, to Handel's music, and the British debut of theatre director Luc Bondy. His production of Peter Handke's The Hour We Knew Nothing of Each Other imports skateboarders, rollerskaters, Tarzan and Moses from Berlin. Mr Brian McMaster, director of the 1994 festival, said yesterday that the new theatre will ensure that 'there are better facilities in Edinburgh than at any other festival in the world.' This year's festival is budgeted at Pounds 4.8m, Pounds 600,000 up on last year. While the festival dance programme is 'one of the biggest ever' there is evidence of more balance between rival art forms than in recent years. Theatre also includes a new Robert Lepage project at Meadowbank Sports Centre (last year's unexpectedly successful last-minute dance venue). The Seven Streams of the River Ota launches an enterprise scheduled to take two to three years, dealing with the impact on the world of the bombing of Hiroshima. Murrayfield Ice Rink is pressed into service for Aeschylus' Oresteia in a production from Moscow by Peter Stein. Of the opera performances, the most exciting may be The Australian Opera's version of Britten's Midsummer Night's Dream, produced by Baz Luhrmann, the young director of the film Strictly Ballroom, and already rapturously received on its home territory. But the Festival Theatre is baptised appropriately by Scottish Opera on 15 August with Fidelio. Beethoven provides one of the musical themes this year, together with Chabrier, whose Etoile is accompanied by a new production from Opera North of Le Roi Malgre Lui. Beethoven's nine symphonies and five piano concertos will field such performers as Andras Schiff, Richard Goode, Frans Bruggen, Alfred Brendel and Bernard Haitink.</p>

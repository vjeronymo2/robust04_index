			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> The UC Santa Barbara Faculty Legislature voted 31 to 7 to require an ethnic  studies course as part of the school's basic undergraduate education. The  course will replace one of two American history and institutions classes now  required. A vote on requiring two ethnic studies courses failed 13 to 31. The  faculty group also voted to form a seven-member committee to implement the new  ethnic studies requirement. One professor has vowed to force the issue to a  mail ballot of the entire UCSB faculty. University rules require such a vote if  25 or more faculty members sign a petition.  </P></p>

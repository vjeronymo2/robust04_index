David Messman, Branch Chief, at (202) 942&hyph;0564 (Division of Investment Management, Office of Investment Company Regulation).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Supplementary Information:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public Reference Branch.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicant's Representations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Applicant, an open-end non-diversified management investment company, is organized as a business trust under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. On July 19, 1989, applicant filed a notification of registration on Form N&hyph;8A under section 8(a) of the Act, and a registration statement on Form N&hyph;1A under section 8(b) of the Act and the Securities Act of 1933. The registration statement became effective on September 15, 1989, and the public offering of applicant's shares commenced on that date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. At a meeting held on February 27, 1993, applicant's board of trustees approved agreements and plans of reorganization providing for the transfer of all of the assets of applicant's two series to two other investment companies. These agreements provided for the transfer of all of the assets of (1) Templeton Insured Tax Free Fund (``Templeton Insured'') to Franklin Insured Tax-Free Income Fund (``Franklin Insured''), a series of Franklin Tax-Free Trust, in exchange for shares of Franklin Insured, and (2) Templeton Tax Free Money Fund (``Templeton Money'') to Franklin Tax-Exempt Money Fund (``Franklin Money'') in exchange for shares of Franklin Money.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The trustees determined that the proposed reorganizations were in the best interests of the shareholders of each series because they would permit shareholders to pursue their investment goals in larger funds, which would have enhanced ability to effect portfolio transactions on more favorable terms and should have greater investment flexibility. The trustees also decided that the reorganizations would enable shareholders to obtain the benefits of economies of scale.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Templeton Global Bond Managers (``Templeton Global''), a division of Templeton Investment Counsel, Inc. (``TICI''), is the investment adviser for Templeton Insured and Templeton Money. Franklin Advisers, Inc. is the investment adviser for Franklin Insured and Franklin Money. TICI and Franklin Advisers, Inc. are wholly owned subsidiaries of Franklin Resources, Inc. Accordingly, Templeton Insured and Franklin Insured, and Templeton Money and Franklin Money, may be deemed to be affiliated persons by reason of being under the control of investment advisers that are themselves under common control. Applicant therefore relied on the exemption provided by rule 17a&hyph;8 under the Act to effect the transaction. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  Consequently, the trustees determined, in accordance with rule 17a&hyph;8, that the purchase of the assets of the two series by Franklin Insured and Franklin Money was in the best interests of the shareholders of the series, and that such purchases would not result in any dilution to the interests of the existing shareholders of the series.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 17a&hyph;8 provides relief from the affiliated transaction prohibition of section 17(a) of the Act for a merger of investment companies that may be affiliated persons of each other solely by reason of having a common investment adviser, common directors, and/or common officers. The staff of the Division of Investment Management has stated that it would not recommend that the Commission take enforcement action under section 17(a) of the Act if investment companies that are affiliated persons solely by reason of having investment advisers that are under common control rely on rule 17a&hyph;8.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Capitol Mutual Funds and Nations Fund Trust (pub. avail.

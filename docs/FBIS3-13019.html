			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] TISHRIN comments on the visit of the European Unity  delegation to Damascus and President Hafiz al-Asad's emphasis,  during his reception of the delegation, of Syria's support for  the peace process despite doubts about Israeli seriousness on  this process.    TISHRIN says: Welcoming any European or international effort  to activate the peace process, we reaffirm that peace is a  collective interest, and that the conditions and bases of peace  must be responded to in a positive and constructive spirit. The  paper notes that Europe has come to realize that peace cannot be  achieved under the continued Israeli occupation and that partial  agreements and separate deals cannot lead to lasting peace.  Europe has also come to realize that no peace is possible under  the continued Israeli terrorism, massacres, and crimes.    TISHRIN says: Undoubtedly, when it denounces all those  Israeli anti-peace practices, Europe stresses its demands and  calls for the establishment of a just, comprehensive peace.  Naturally, these demands and denunciations of Israeli practices  should be linked to practical stands and measures leading to an  active and effective European role to help Arabs restore their  rights and territories and to halt the Israeli massacres.    Concluding its editorial, TISHRIN says: Europe should move  to assume its political responsibilities toward the situation in  the region, including the issue of a just, comprehensive peace,  and the enforcement of the resolutions of the international  legitimacy, which primarily call for Israel's full withdrawal  from the occupied Arab territories.</p>

			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / International Company News: Blockbuster clears merger with Viacom The board of US video retailer Blockbuster Entertainment has approved the merger of the company with Viacom, the entertainments group. The decision ends months of uncertainty over the planned Dollars 8.4bn union, which was conceived in January as part of Viacom's Dollars 10bn takeover of Paramount Communications. At the time, the structure of the stock-swap deal would have given Blockbuster stockholders Dollars 31.50 a share. However, a subsequent sharp drop in the value of Viacom stock - which was plagued by concerns about how the group would pay off the more than Dollars 9bn in debt that it took on to acquire Paramount - drastically cut the value of the deal for Blockbuster stockholders. Instead of Dollars 31.50 a share, at one point they were faced with accepting only Dollars 21.75 a share, and it was not long before Mr Wayne Huizenga, Blockbuster chairman, and other leading stockholders began to have second thoughts. By May the deal looked dead, but a gradual recovery in Viacom's share price over the summer (buoyed partly by the impressive performance of Paramount-produced films at the box office) breathed new life into the merger, and late on Tuesday Blockbuster's board approved the transaction. The company's stockholders will now receive about Dollars 29 for each share.</p>

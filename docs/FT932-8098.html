			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Allied-Lyons Allied-Lyons must be distressed beyond measure at the publicity surrounding its Pounds 200m convertible bond issue. The share price had already fallen before the news inexplicably found its way into the weekend press. It jumped over 2 per cent when no bond emerged with the results on Tuesday morning, though the enthusiasm wore off during the day as the market began to suspect that the issue was looming after all. The price fell sharply again yesterday when it was finally launched. That sort of confusion occurs in a market forced to rely on hint and innuendo. It would have been prevented if Allied had come clean with a formal statement about its intentions. It would have lost nothing by doing so once they had been leaked.</p>

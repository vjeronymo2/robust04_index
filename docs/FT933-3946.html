			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / International Company News: S China Morning Post trading stays suspended SHARE trading in South China Morning Post, Hong Kong's leading English language newspaper, remained suspended for the fifth consecutive day, despite the expectation that Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation has secured a buyer for its 50 per cent stake. News Corp announced last Friday that it was negotiating the sale of its stake. For the past three days, announcements from News Corp have been cancelled, encouraging speculation that there has been a hitch in the deal, or that a counter-offer has been received. The stock exchange said that the suspension would not be lifted on SCMP shares until News Corp made an announcement that gave sufficient information about the deal so that informed trading in the shares could resume. It is widely expected in Hong Kong that the News Corp stake will be purchased by a consortium led by Malaysian tycoon Mr Robert Kuok. At the same time, Singapore's Straits Press group is tipped to take on a management role in the Hong Kong newspaper. Mr Kuok has no newspaper expertise, while Straits Press, which already owns 5 per cent of the SCMP, has made no secret of its desire to become the leading newspaper publisher in South East Asia. The Singaporean United Overseas Bank holds a further 9 per cent stake in SCMP.</p>

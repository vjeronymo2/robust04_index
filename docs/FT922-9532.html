			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Switzerland (7): Cloud over the cartels - Trade policy faces an overhaul PARTICIPATION in the European Economic Area (EEA) and eventual EC membership will give a substantial boost to the Swiss economy, but some sectors will suffer painful adjustments. Economists agree that the impetus to growth will come not so much from higher exports to more open European markets, but from greater efficiency due to stiffer competition in domestic markets. Though Switzerland's heavily protected agricultural sector is not directly affected by the EEA, it too is being forced to contemplate radical change in the light of the current round of global trade talks now nearing a close under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) in Geneva. A Gatt report on Switzerland's trade policy last autumn pointed out that, while Swiss per capita incomes were more than 25 per cent above those in the US and Canada in 1989, they lagged in terms of purchasing power. Swiss food prices are well above EC levels, with consumers bearing 80 per cent of the SFr7bn annual cost of farm support through guaranteed prices, tariffs and border restrictions. In industry too, while external trade policies are a model of liberal economic principles, a network of formal and informal cartels between domestic producers and traders keeps prices high and stringent regulations tend to restrict competition from new entrants. As a result, Swiss consumers pay over 40 per cent more for goods and services than their EC counterparts, according to the Swiss Bank Corporation. Unusually in Europe, Swiss law permits cartels, providing only for investigation of abuses. No-one knows for sure how many cartels there are, but one estimate puts the number at 900, many of which involve price-fixing. Some, as in brewing, have crumbled under competitive pressures and others, like the banking conventions, have been dismantled at government insistence. But the bulk have been untouched for many years. EEA membership will entail adoption of EC competition law which forbids cartels and curtails monopolies. The SBC study published last month estimated that the EEA could boost Switzerland's economic growth rate by 0.5 percentage points a year, a gain of 4-6 per cent by the end of the decade. The Basle-based Economic Research Institute (BAK) thinks the benefits would be even greater, with the Swiss economy growing by 2.3 per cent a year within the EEA to the year 2000 and only 1.1 per cent a year outside it. SBC's economists identified two vulnerable sectors: the construction industry, due to an opening of public procurement - especially at cantonal level - to foreign bidding; and medium-sized companies geared primarily to the domestic market, notably in commerce, the food and drink industry and services. Main beneficiaries would be pharmaceuticals, insurance companies and multinationals including the banks. Switzerland's successful export industries have undergone major structural adjustments over the past decade or so, shifting further to capital-intensive, high value-added products and services to economise on scarce and expensive skilled labour and land. Most already have a solid base in the EC. The Community accounts for nearly half Switzerland's foreign assets of SFr85bn, half the near-1m overseas employees of Swiss companies, and two-thirds of Switzerland's foreign trade. Useful but unspectacular gains will come from harmonisation of standards and common regulations throughout the 19-nation EEA, as well as freer movement of labour and an end to the Lex Friedrich which restricts land sales to foreigners. Industry will also welcome the assurance of future harmonisation of technical and environmental standards, which could otherwise pose trade barriers. Swiss farmers view the future with much more apprehension. They have turned out in their thousands to demonstrate in the capital, Bern, and in Geneva against Gatt proposals that would oblige Switzerland to scrap its import quota system on agricultural products in favour of tariffs, and reduce domestic subsidies for agriculture by some 20 per cent by 1999. These proposals, and future EC membership, could slash farm incomes by as much as half, according to farmers' groups. The government has said that the Gatt plan is not acceptable. But it has admitted that Switzerland's 'war economy' farm policy based on ensuring food self-sufficiency and maximising farmholdings is no longer tenable. The effect has been to generate chronic surpluses and encourage heavy use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides, while failing to protect farmers' incomes or stop the exodus from the land. The federal council is now proposing a shift from price supports to direct income payments which would be largely independent of production. These would be permitted under the Gatt plan. The intention is to target payments at services provided in the public interest, such as food security and care of the countryside, while ensuring that prices better reflect market conditions and come down further towards EC levels. This is bound to produce some restructuring and consolidation of Switzerland's 90,000 farms, 40 per cent of them part-time. While international pressures will lead to greater economic competitiveness, many of the economic and political constraints that handicap efficiency will require independent action by the Swiss government. The federal council has said that it plans to reduce the extent of regulation (for instance, it recently denoun- ced the International Labour Organisation convention banning night work for women in industry). But it is not obvious how it can reform the legal and political system that enables citizens to delay inordinately investment projects and other economic initiatives, while maintaining desired high environmental and health and safety standards. Mr Jean-Pascal Delamuraz, the economy minister, gave a telling example of Swiss dilatoriness to the upper house of parliament a couple of months ago. 'One Sunday, the Swiss people said yes to Rail 2000 (a programme to modernise and expand the rail network). The following Monday, the French government said yes to the construction of the Atlantic TGV. Result: we have constructed a few metres of Rail 2000 and Adolf Ogi (the transport minister) is fighting 80 appeals per kilometre. Meanwhile, the TGV is running at 514 kilometres an hour from end to end.'</p>

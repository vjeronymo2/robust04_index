			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Management: Calling all those budding writers A challenge to budding essayists is issued today by the Financial Times and the UK's Management Consultancies Association. It comes in the form of a jointly sponsored award aimed at encouraging managers and management consultants to write a stimulating, original and non-technical essay on a subject of current business interest. Inspired by the government's white paper in May, the chosen topic for this year's competition is 'Competitiveness - the key to success'. The winning essay, say the sponsors, 'will be the one that is judged to add focus to the debate by suggesting means, structural and substantial rather than tactical and cosmetic, by which organisations can ensure greater competitiveness through appropriate management of operations'. Entries, which have to be submitted by December 1, must be between 2,000 and 3,000 words and written in English. The winning author will receive a Pounds 3,000 cash prize and, with other suitable essays, his or her work will appear in a booklet to be published by the MCA in early 1995. The winning article will be considered for publication in the FT. For conditions of entry and an entry form contact FT-MCA Management Essay Award, c/o Management Consultancies Association, 11 West Halkin Street, London SW1X 8JL.  ------------------------ The MCA has announced the second year of its sponsorship of a prize to recognise and reward writers of management books. The main prize of Pounds 5,000 is open to British writers of all ages, while a special commendation (worth up to Pounds 2,000) will be made to the best entry written by an author under 35.

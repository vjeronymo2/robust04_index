			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Finance Minister Theo Waigel: "The European </F> Union Is Getting New Payers"]    [Text] Germany's payments to the European Community have  been the focus of public discussion for the past few months. In  this connection it is often ignored that important steps have  already been taken to improve Germany's financial situation  toward the EC.    Most recently, during the membership negotiations for  Austria, Norway, Sweden, and Finland, I advocated Germany's  financial interests without endangering the fair balance with  the would-be members. I expressly welcome the enlargement of  the European Union [EU] by the four EFTA [European Free Trade  Association] states. These countries are an enrichment for the  EC both in political and economic terms. The membership  negotiations were successful for Germany also from the financial  viewpoint: Three of the four would-be members are net payers of  EC cash. With them we also gain important support for our  efforts to implement the principles of thrift and strict budget  discipline at the European level. Thus, already during the  membership negotiations demands by other member states for  internal EC compensation were successfully rejected.    We have achieved an important success in the negotiations on  the new decision about the EC's own resources, which are the  financial basis of the EC. According to this decision, in the  future the EU Commission will explain which resources go to  which member states. This will clarify the distribution effect  of the EC budget. This newly created clarity was an  indispensable condition for my basic agreement to this decision.  On the one hand, this creates absolute clarity about the use of  the tax money that is available to the EC. On the other hand, it  shows potential distortions in payments, demonstrating the need  to implement corrections.    At the negotiations about the EC's financial framework for  1993 to 1999 we considerably restricted the original ideas of  the EC Commission and of other member states. The suggested  expansion of the EC's financial resources was postponed by two  years; only 35 percent of the demanded increase in the EC's  financial resources were approved. On the basis of the final  year of 1999, this means that about 15 billion German marks will  be saved.    As a result of the European Council meeting in Edinburgh in  1992, after long and difficult negotiations the Council of  Ministers came to a decision on 21 March 1994, which establishes  an upper limit for more than half of the EC budget expenditures  -- expenditures for agriculture -- for the next few years.  Strict budget discipline for the EC budget must be applied to  all spheres of expenditures. During the second half of 1994,  when Germany holds the presidency, I will continue to  emphatically insist on strict thrift.    To halt the flood of programs from Brussels, strict  yardsticks of whether or not something can be rejected will be  applied when new programs are presented or existing EC programs  are to be continued. The Federal Government examines every  proposal very thoroughly as to whether the EC should decide,  implement, and finance certain measures at all from the  viewpoint of subsidiarity. When the people in Germany are  expected to accept some cuts because of the budget consolidation  in the federal government, the laender, and the communities,  achievements that one has grown fond of must also be examined at  the EC level. There must not and will not be any taboos at the  European level. Enforcing strict budget discipline in the  circle of our EU partners will not be simple. However, there is  no realistic alternative to that.    Our efforts to improve Germany's financial situation toward  the EC cannot be exhausted just by saving. It is necessary to  try out all possibilities that can lastingly improve our  position. In particular, we will implement our financial  interest in increased returns in connection with formulating  expenditures if they cannot be avoided at the EC level because  of their contents and scope and with distributing the means.  Thus, for instance, we will insist on considerable EC  participation in the current negotiations about the financing of  trans-European networks in Germany.    The FRG will not call into question the EU decisions that  were made, for instance, by the heads of state and government at  the European Council meeting in Edinburgh in December 1992. We  are and remain a politically credible, predictable, and reliable  partner. Regardless of that, I will continue to work  consistently toward achieving a gradual improvement of our  financial situation in the EU in all fields of policy that are  important for financing.    The financial aspect is only a partial aspect of  integration.  To fully assess the matter one must take into consideration the  political and economic advantages that all member states derive  equally from their membership in the EU. I share the view that  was expressed by the German Bundesbank in its monthly report of  November 1993. The advantages of a large unified market have a  positive effect on the prosperity of all those who participate  in the EU market and form the basis for the competitiveness of  European companies on the world market.    European integration is the guarantor for peace in Europe  and  stability in the world. Unfortunately, in the Balkans one can  still see every day how brittle peace is in view of crumbling  structures and the resulting reemergence of nationalism.</p>

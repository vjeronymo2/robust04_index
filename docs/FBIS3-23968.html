			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Istomin: "Charity Begins at Home..."] </F>   [Text] The policy line of reform in agriculture, which  seemed to have had only destructive aims, now appears to be  relenting. Actually, to put it more precisely, it is preparing  to relent. This is the impression that was created by the press  conference Russian Vice-Premier A.Kh. Zaveryukha held when he  returned from Orel. It is time to recover from the shock, the  vice premier stressed. It is time to begin protecting the  domestic producer of goods and to supply the population with  stocks of its own food.    This year Russia will officially refuse to import many types  of agricultural products, or at least will not be buying them in  the same quantities as before. Calculations have shown that we  have enough forage grain, for example. Of course, this does not  mean that the country will call a complete halt to integration  with foreign partners. It still cannot get by without buying  part of its corn, groats, and components for the mixed feed  industry.    Protection will also be required for animal husbandry, a  branch which suffered more than others last year--the output of  meat and milk decreased and the size of the herd was reduced.  Furthermore, the products of our meat combines are frequently  crowded off store counters by inferior but cheaper foreign  products. Apparently, more formidable customs tariffs will be  instituted for these imports.    As for the financial status of the agroindustrial complex,  it  is more critical than ever before. The reason is that capital  investments in agriculture are incommensurate with the  proportional importance of this branch in the economy: It  accounts for more than 30 percent of the gross national product.  And what about the price disparities? Last year the prices of  agricultural products increased 8.5-fold while the prices of  manufactured goods increased 12-fold. Furthermore, a debt of 1.8  trillion rubles is already owed to the rural community, and this  is the reason for all of the unclaimed fertilizer, equipment,  fuel....    There is still time to correct the situation, however. The  vice premier reported that allocations to agriculture in just  the first quarter might amount to 2.3 trillion rubles.  Otherwise, the upcoming sowing season could be disrupted. In  all, the government has requested around 14 trillion rubles for  specific programs. This would be enough to make the agrarian  sector work, even if not at top efficiency. Otherwise, A.Kh.  Zaveryukha stressed, we can return to the shovel and rake.</p>

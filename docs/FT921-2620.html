			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / SIB backs single watchdog for private investors A SINGLE watchdog should be set up in the UK to regulate investments offered to private individuals, according to a report published yesterday. The recommendation has won the broad backing of the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief investment watchdog, which sponsored the report. It could herald a further rationalisation of the fragmented system of investment regulation introduced after the 1986 Financial Services Act. Creation of a single, super-regulator for private investors has recently been put on the political agenda by the Labour party, whose City affairs spokeswoman, Ms Marjorie Mowlam, has pushed for such a move. It has also received wide support in the City. The recommendation came in a report by Sir Kenneth Clucas, who was asked by the SIB in October to look into the possibility of forming a single self-regulating organisation (SRO) for retail investment. At present, retail investment is regulated in the UK by four different SROs, the SIB itself and a number of professional bodies. Under Sir Kenneth's proposals, a super-regulator would be created to take over the bulk of the job. The Clucas review was prompted by growing problems at Fimbra, one of the SROs, which is responsible for regulating independent financial advisers, managers and brokers. The fact that Fimbra's members, who are largely paid by commission, could not easily pass the costs of regulation on to their clients had put them at a disadvantage to others, such as agents of life assurance companies, the report said. This had created a 'vicious spiral' of declining membership at Fimbra, meaning that the 'organisation's future viability cannot be guaranteed'. The new investment watchdog would combine the activities of Fimbra and Lautro, which regulates the selling of life assurance and unit trust investment products. This would bring life assurance companies into the organisation, providing it with stronger financial backing than that enjoyed by Fimbra. Fimbra has already relied on ad hoc contributions from life companies to pay its way. In addition, the new watchdog would take private client fund management from Imro, the SRO responsible for investment management. However, Sir Kenneth stopped short of suggesting a merger of Imro and the Securities and Futures Authority, the remaining SRO, to leave the investment world with just two watchdogs. Sir Kenneth said regulation undertaken directly by SIB and the Insurance Brokers Registration Council should pass to the new body, although legislation would be needed for such a change. The new body would not oversee retail stockbroking, and other 'recognised professional bodies' would continue to be responsible for their members' investment business. The SIB said it welcomed the report and would set up a working party to propose a structure and constitution for the body, which could come into existence by April 1993.</p>

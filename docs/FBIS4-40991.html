			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS news analyst Vladimir Gondusov] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 22 TASS -- It is precisely the border  problems with Estonia, which lays claims to part of Russian  territory, that prompted Russian President Boris Yeltsin  unilaterally to define Russia's state border on terrain by a  decree, dated June 21, pending the conclusion on a  Russo-Estonian border treaty, Major-General Aleksey Kolesnikov,  deputy commander-in-chief of Russia's frontier forces, told  ITAR-TASS in an exclusive interview on Wednesday.    Unfortunately, Estonia is dragging out talks on a joint  description and designation of the border on terrain in  accordance with the universally accepted international practice.  This brings about difficulties in the protection of Russian  borders. The guarding of borders cannot be exercised if they  are not clearly defined, Kozhevnikov said.    As is known, Estonia claims part of Narva district in  Leningrad region and Pechora district in Pskov region. This is  a territory with an area of 2,300 square kilometers.  Nationalist-minded Estonian organisations have repeatedly  attempted to set up road barriers on Russia's territory, thereby  asserting "a new Russo- Estonian border." Various assemblies  and congresses periodically demand that the "historical lands"  be handed back to the Estonian side. The president of Russia  said a firm "no" to attempts at arbitrarily changing the  established borders.    Meanwhile the situation in the border sector remains  complex.  Attempts to cross the border unlawfully or to smuggle contraband  merchandise, including arms and narcotics, continue unabated.    Russian border guards counter the criminals' challenge by  adroit arrangements for guard duty and by enhanced cooperation  with the customs personnel and law enforcement agencies.    Operations to identify smuggling channels prove resultative.  This is evidenced by tens of firearms, hundreds of kilogrammes  of narcotics, tonnes of non-ferrous metals, fuel, and art  treasures that are intercepted at the border every month.    The accommodation of troops remains a painful problem with  the border guards. In the opinion of the deputy  commander-in-chief, personnel withdrawn from the Baltics had to  begin accommodation arrangements practically from scratch.  Estonia did not assign funds for that, although the withdrawn  personnel left behind durable buildings and facilities, valuable  radar and searchlight equipment, obstructions systems and many  other things worth billions of roubles.    The Baltic district was among the Soviet Union's best  accommodated ones. All this remains the subject of the talks  but there are no constructive solutions so far, General  Kozhevnikov said.    As Boris Yeltsin stated when addressing border guards on the  eve of their professional holiday, "Russia favours the  development of good-neighbourly relations with Latvia,  Lithuania, and Estonia and wider cooperation with them. But  these states are not members of the CIS. Therefore the border  regime should be sound and the guarding of the border should be  organised accordingly."</p>

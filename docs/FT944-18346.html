			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / UK Company News: MGN lifts Scottish TV stake to 20% Senior executives from Mirror Group Newspapers and Scottish Television are to meet within the next week following the disclosure yesterday that MGN had increased its stake in STV from 15 to 20 per cent. Sources at STV said that the meeting had been sought by MGN, although the subjects for discussion were not known. MGN refused to comment. A statement from STV said: 'The purchase of the balance of 5 per cent of STV shares was anticipated and takes MGN's stake to 19.99 per cent, the maximum allowed by the cross media ownership rules under the Broadcasting Act. MGN has reiterated its announcement of support for STV and its management.' MGN, through its subsidiary the Scottish Daily Record and Sunday Mail, bought 2.45m shares in STV at 520p per share at a total cost of Pounds 12.7m. The move follows the dawn raid of two weeks ago which netted the publishing group a 14.9 per cent stake for Pounds 37.4m. Then Mr Murdoch MacLennan, chief executive of the Scottish Daily Record, had said: 'We do not believe it is necessary for the two companies to come under common control for these benefits to be achieved.' STV shares closed down 1p at 493p. MGN shares were unchanged at 129p. Carlton Communications is paying Pounds 20m for the 10 per cent of shares it does not own in Carlton Television Holdings. The Telegraph and Gemina Investments, which each took a 5 per cent stake in the subsidiary prior to Carlton's successful franchise bid in 1991, will receive their payments as shares in the parent group. The payment to the Telegraph includes the cost of the original Pounds 1.3m investment, and for Pounds 2.1m of loan stock.</p>

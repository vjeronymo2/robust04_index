Hagensen gave Jagland a unique testimonial and described the  personal chemistry between them as "excellent." He said the  present division of labor between the party leader and the prime  minister is a major reason for the Labor Party's gains in the  election and in the opinion polls.    Hagensen confirmed that cooperation between the LO and the  party is more flexible now than it was when Gro Harlem  Brundtland was party leader. He said the strained relations that  prevailed between himself and Brundtland at times was due to the  fact that they both have a very direct style.    It is no secret that Hagensen fought behind the scenes to  get  "his" man in as the head of the Labor Party after Prime Minister  Brundtland made the surprise announcement at the national  congress in November 1992 that she was resigning as party  leader. As head of the nominating committee, Hagensen had a  finger in the pie. He has now confirmed that he got the result  he wanted.    "The personal chemistry is excellent. I think Thorbjorn is  doing a good job as party leader. He also has the Storting group  under control. I was sure that when he got a leading role, he  would acquire the kind of self-confidence that would allow him  to flourish. He has done so, and at the same time, Gro is doing  a good job as prime minister. There is a good division of labor  between the party leader, the prime minister, and the  government," Hagensen said.    We asked what had caused the strained relations between  Hagensen and the prime minister.    "My style is direct and so is hers. We do not restrain  ourselves when we disagree. Even though everyone expects us to  lay all disagreements aside and put on a good act when we hold a  joint news conference. But that is not the way we are, Gro and  I."    Hagensen stressed that it was mainly their personal styles  that led to collisions.    "My personal relations with Brundtland have never been  negative, let me emphasize that. But when we disagree, we are  unable to conceal it. She says what she thinks, and I say what I  think."</p>

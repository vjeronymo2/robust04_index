			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Vladimir Taranov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 17 TASS -- A statement of the Russian  Federation Council's committee for international issues  expressed concern over the U.S. Senate decision on unilateral  lift of the embargo on arms delivery to Bosnia. The embargo  introduced by the United Nations Security Council. [sentence as  received]    In the opinion of the committee members, such unilateral  measures may hamper successful implementation of the  Russian-U.S.-European policy on Bosnia. The committee calls  against the delivery of any arms to the conflicting sides and  believes that suspension and further lift of sanctions against  Yugoslavia as a result of Serb implementation of the peace plan  would help the achievement of lasting peace in Bosnia and  Herzegovina.    The committee stands for comprehensive development and  consolidation of the Russian-U.S. relations proceeding from the  fact that Russia and the United States carry special  responsibility for peace and stability in international  relations and could act as guarantors in settlement of the  Bosnian conflict.    The soonest termination of combat operations in  long-suffering Bosnia and Herzegovina corresponds to the  interests of the international community, thinks the committee.  Arms deliveries to the conflict zone will entail the deepening  and expansion of the conflict.    The committee is ready for consultations and coordinated  actions with the U.S. Senate in solution of the Bosnian problem,  says the statement.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Finance Minister Avraham Shohat today told members  of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that the  economic agreement signed with the Palestinians is based on  intentions to have economic cooperation and that it may  contribute to the development of ties between Israel and the  Near East countries. The agreement is good for us and for the  Palestinians, and it leaves Israel in control over the main  issues pertaining to our interests, the finance minister  asserted.    Our correspondent Eytan Almog reports that replying to a  question by Likud chairman Binyamin Netanyahu, the finance  minister said there are no signs of a Palestinian migration from  the territories to the Arab countries as a result of the closure.    Replying to a question by Beni Begin, Shohat said there is  no  need for a Palestinian currency seeing that the agreement does  not provide for a central Palestinian bank or an independent  Palestinian economic system.    Former Finance Minister Moshe Nisim sharply attacked the  agreement, saying that as a consequence, compensation will have  to be paid to Israeli farmers and that industrialists claim it  will lead to the dismissal of 9,000 workers. Nisim added that  this is not an economic, but a political and nationalist  agreement. Minister Shohat replied that the Palestinians signed  the agreement for economic reasons. They are being subjected to  heavy pressures by the Arab countries for having signed the  agreement, and this proves that theirs were economic rather than  political considerations, the finance minister said.</p>

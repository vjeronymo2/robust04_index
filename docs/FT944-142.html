			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Employers wary of a marriage made in Milton Keynes: Tecs and chambers of commerce are set for a wave of mergers, reports Motoko Rich What do you call the private-sector, employer-led bodies which provide a range of business services? Business leaders could not be blamed for throwing up their hands in confusion at the number of organisations which fit this bill. Milton Keynes, for instance, had two - Milton Keynes and North Buckinghamshire Training and Enterprise Council, and Milton Keynes Chamber of Commerce. When they polled local businesses, they found many were not sure of the difference between the two. Now there is no longer a distinction. In December the chamber and the Tec - one of the 82 employer-led bodies which administer government-funded training in England and Wales - formed one organisation to provide services such as training, export advice, political lobbying services and networking. The merger, the first of its kind, follows the government's decision to allow voluntary mergers between individual Tecs and chambers of commerce. It is understood that more than 10 other Tecs and chambers are planning similar partnerships. Mr Michael Hind, chief executive of the merged Milton Keynes body, said: 'We thought we had a responsibility to clarify marketplace confusion. There will now be a powerful and unified voice for the local business community.' Although the Tec National Council and the British Chambers of Commerce support such mergers, some members of the business community are far less enthusiastic. The Forum of Private Business and the Federation of Small Businesses have warned that the merged entities could be a backdoor route to the establishment of statutory chambers on the model of continental Europe, where levies are charged to every business. Mr Stan Mendham, chief executive of the Forum of Private Business, which represents 22,851 small businesses, said: 'Once the merged bodies are in place, it will become more obvious that they are an extension of government because the Tecs are an extension of government.' The Tecs receive government funding, but are set up as private companies. Any merged organisation must ensure that its structure prevents public funds being used for the chamber's business lobbying purposes. The new entity must also fulfil all requirements set down by the government in its contracts with Tecs, and maintain the central functions of both organisations. The government has emphasised that the mergers are voluntary and that a new body must 'demonstrate that it is representative of the full range of employers in its area and not just its membership base'. The new Milton Keynes organisation will have a turnover of about Pounds 11.5m in 1995, a membership of about 1,300 businesses and a combined staff of 90. No redundancies are planned. An interim board, with members from both bodies, has been appointed. Mr Chris Humphries, director of policy and strategy at the Tec National Council, said the new organisations would be expected to boost their membership and their accountability, expand membership services, and work to increase their co-operation with Business Links - the trade department's network of one-stop advice shops. Mr Mendham said he wondered whether the merged entities would be responsive to business needs. 'Tecs and the chambers are doing what they think is right for the small-business community,' he said. 'But they do not have a clear understanding of what the small-business community actually wants.'</p>

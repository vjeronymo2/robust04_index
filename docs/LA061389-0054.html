			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> Three grocery chains have settled false-advertising cases brought jointly by  the San Diego city attorney's office and the Los Angeles County district  attorney's office about ads offering "unlimited double coupons."  </P> <P> The settlement reached Friday stipulates that the grocery store companies,  without admitting any wrongdoing, are permanently barred from using the word  "unlimited" in advertisements or store signs that refer to doubling the face  value of manufacturers' coupons when that service is actually limited, deputy  City Atty. Tricia C. Johnson said.  </P> <P> The settlement calls for penalties of $32,650 against Ralph's Grocery Company,  $32,500 against Alpha Beta Company, and $32,000 against Safeway Stores, Johnson  said. The settlement injunction applies to advertisements by the companies  throughout the state.  </P> <P> The cases resulted from a complaint filed with the San Diego city attorney's  consumer-fraud unit last June. Several limitations to the "unlimited double  coupon" promotions existed, Johnson said, including the number, type and value  of the coupons the stores would double.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County became involved because the ads were running throughout  Southern California.  </P></p>

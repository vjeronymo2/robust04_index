			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ICA SEEKS CHAPTER 11 AFTER IMPERIAL SEIZURE  </P> <P> Imperial Corp. of America, the San Diego-based parent company of Imperial  Savings Assn. has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in U.S. Bankruptcy  Court in San Diego, the company said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Imperial Savings, the nation's 16th largest S&amp;L, was one of 12 troubled  thrifts that were seized Friday by federal regulators.  </P> <P> Imperial, which had $9.7 billion in assets on Dec. 31, also reported $9.6  billion in liabilities and a negative net worth of $60.1 million, according to  regulators.  </P> <P> Imperial was by far the largest single business owned by ICA, which also owns a  handful of relatively small insurance, investment and real estate operations.  ICA reported a $136.2-million net loss for the nine-month period ended Sept.  31.  </P> <P> The Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing "will protect ICA's present assets,  consolidate pending disputes and litigation in one court and give the company  an opportunity to file a plan of reorganization," according to a press release  issued Wednesday by ICA.  </P> <P> ICA Chief Executive Lyman Hamilton said the filing will "protect our  bondholders, shareholders and continue our operating businesses. . . . We  believe this was a prudent thing to do."  </P> <P> S&amp;L industry analysts earlier in the week predicted that ICA would be  forced into bankruptcy court following the seizure of Imperial Savings.  </P> <P> Wednesday's filing contained no details about ICA's financial health. Filings  to be made during the next two weeks will describe the company's assets and  liabilities, said Patrick Shea, a San Diego-based attorney who is representing  ICA in the bankruptcy filing.  </P> <P> Wednesday's filing did not affect Imperial Savings, which is being operated on  a day-to-day basis by the federal Resolution Trust Corp., which disposes of  failed banks and thrifts.  </P></p>

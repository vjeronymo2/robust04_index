			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Observer: On target If you pay peanuts, you get monkeys. This old adage comes to mind after the latest howler in the Wall Street Journal Europe's investment dartboard contest. It involved a bunch of investment professionals pitting their stock-picking skills against a group of monkeys (said to be reporters in real life) who choose their stocks by throwing darts at the newspaper's stock market pages. On Tuesday, the WSJ ran a big story about how its dart-tossing monkey had beaten the investment pros yet again. Perhaps the WSJ should go easy on the peanuts. Yesterday it had to admit that the shares picked by the investment pros had in fact risen by 8.7 per cent and not fallen by 7 per cent, which looks pretty impressive compared with the 5.5 per cent decline in the monkey's portfolio. Apparently, someone had forgotten to take account of a share split. The motto of this unhappy tale is that, while the monkeys should not be stopped from throwing darts, perhaps the investment pros should do the adding up.</p>

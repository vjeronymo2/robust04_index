			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / International Company News: Statoil up slightly despite low crude prices STATOIL, the Norwegian state oil company, yesterday reported a slight increase in first-half net profit in the opening half of 1993, against a background of difficult market conditions. Net profits were NKr1.9bn (Dollars 259m), against NKr1.8bn a year ago. The group has had to battle against lower average oil prices, a fall in equity crude oil production, and a NKr200m charge against accounts. Statoil warned of a lower second-half operating profit on the basis of current crude oil prices, and a continued fall in crude production from the giant Statfjord field. First-half operating profit fell to NKr6.6bn from NKr7bn on revenues of NKr42.6bn, against NKr40.4bn. Statoil said Brent blend reference crude averaged Dollars 18.22 per barrel in the first half, down from Dollars 19 last year, as equity crude production slipped to 75m barrels from 78m. 'The start of the second half-year has been characterised by declining oil prices and considerable uncertainty about price development for crude oil, refined oil products and petrochemicals,' Statoil said. Helped by a stronger dollar-krone exchange rate and a NKr311m reduction in costs, to NKr8.49bn, exploration and production was the main reason for the improvement in first-half operating profit, to NKr5bn from NKr4.8bn. In the natural gas division, operating profit fell to NKr1.6bn from NKr2bn due to lower revenue from gas transport as volumes fell and tariff prices were adjusted. In refining and marketing, operating profit dipped to NKr472m from NKr476m against tougher marketing competition but with improved refining margins.</p>

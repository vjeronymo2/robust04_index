			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SURFING AT OCEANSIDE;  </P> <P> BESCHEN PARLAYS NEW UNDERDOG ROLE INTO UPSET  </P> <P> Shane Beschen has felt the pressure of being a favorite on the Professional  Surfing Assn. of America this year, so playing the underdog role at the Life's  A Beach surfing competition Friday was a welcome relief.  </P> <P> Beschen of San Clemente, seeded 31st, upset second-seeded Dave Maccaulay of  Cowaramup Bay, Australia, 99.8 to 88, in the second round at the Oceanside  Pier.  </P> <P> It was the second consecutive upset for Beschen, who beat 18th-seeded Glen  Winton of Norah Head, Australia, in Thursday's first round.  </P> <P> Beschen competes regularly on the PSAA's U.S. tour, but has joined the Assn. of  Surfing Professionals world tour for its stops at Oceanside this weekend and  the Op Pro at Huntington Beach July 30-Aug. 4.  </P> <P> "Last year, I was an underdog on the PSAA tour," said Beschen, who is third in  the U.S. point standings. "No one expected me to do anything. But this year, I  led the point standings for a while and the whole focus of the tour turned to  me.  </P> <P> "When I come to these (world tour) contests, it's like starting all over again.  Nobody knows who you are."  </P> <P> Ninth-seeded Richie Collins of Newport Beach was the only other Orange County  surfer to advance to today's third round. Jeff Booth of Laguna Beach and Matt  Archbold of San Clemente were eliminated Friday. The finals are set for Sunday  at noon. MIKE REILLEY  </P></p>

			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: London increases share of Ecu banking market LONDON'S share of the Ecu banking market showed a further increase last year, while the proportion of business in Paris and Brussels has shown a steady decline since 1985, according to the Bank for International Settlements' quarterly report on developments in the Ecu financial markets. 'In the space of a few years London has become the main centre for Ecu bank business,' accounting for 27 per cent of the market, said the report. There has also been a surge of activity in Sweden, from Ecu1bn at the end of 1990 to Ecu6bn in September 1991, following the linkage of the krona to the Ecu last year. Activity in Germany remains relatively modest despite the lifting of restrictions on Ecu deposits. The growth in the Ecu banking market last year was outstripped only by the surge of activity in the Ecu bond market. Ecu banking transactions grew at an annual rate of 25 per cent for the first nine months of last year, bringing the total assets of BIS reporting banks (those in Europe and Japan) to Ecu176bn, compared with Ecu149bn in 1990 and just Ecu64bn in 1985. The Ecu banking market has retained two distinctive features: the predominance of interbank activity (nearly three-quarters of total bank assets) and the high geographical concentration of business within Europe. But there are a number of important developments, such as the shift in the net position of reporting banks from a net asset position at the end of 1988 to a net liability position in September 1991, reflecting the increasing amount of assets held by non-bank institutions. However, the bulk of assets are still mainly held by non-bank financial institutions such as insurance companies, according to Jean-Louis Pezet, an analyst at Credit Lyonnais. The sharp expansion of holdings by central banks has also boosted activity. The BIS estimates central bank deposits in the Ecu market at around Ecu30bn, with a further Ecu4bn-5bn held in the form of securities. The increased holdings of central banks in private Ecu, rather than official Ecu (which cannot be traded), is also a notable development, analysts say. Meanwhile, the Ecu bond market experienced a record period of growth in the first nine months of last year. The total stock of outstanding Ecu bonds reached Ecu72bn as of September 1991, with secondary market turnover 10 times greater than in 1989. Increased borrowing by European governments was a catalyst for growth, encouraging broader participation by institutional investors. The bond market has also been able to feed off the growing Ecu swaps market and the development of Ecu futures and options contracts. Movement towards European monetary union has underpinned the growth of activity in Ecu financial markets, although some segments remain underdeveloped, and the elimination of much of the uncertainty surrounding the future of the Ecu at the Maastricht summit last December is expected to fuel further expansion. There is a need 'to differentiate between financial and commercial use of the Ecu,' according to Mr Bertrand de Maigret, managing director of the Association for the Monetary Union of Europe. He said that commercial invoicing in Ecu is rare, outside certain areas like transportation. It is a problem which the European Community is preparing to tackle. This summer, officials at DG2, one of the Commission directorates, will publish a white paper describing all the legal and technical obstacles to the use of Ecu.</p>

			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: EIB balance sheet total rises to Ecu74.3bn THE president of the European Investment Bank yesterday said the bank's role in the long-term financing of EC integration had been 'confirmed and further developed' by the outcome of December's Maastricht summit of EC leaders. Mr Ernst-Gunther Broder announced that the EIB raised Ecu13.7bn on the capital markets last year - an increase of more than 24 per cent on 1990, when Ecu11bn was borrowed. The bank lent Ecu15.3bn, compared with Ecu13.4bn the previous year and its balance sheet total increased from Ecu63.5bn to Ecu74.3bn. 'The volume of funds mobilised by our bank in 1991 is larger than that of any other international financing institution, including the World Bank,' he added. The majority of loans went towards promoting social and economic integration in the EC, but the proportion of loans to non-EC countries increased from 5.3 per cent to nearly 6 per cent of the total, a record Ecu916m. Mr Broder said the EIB would continue to co-finance projects outside the EC with the World Bank and the new European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in eastern Europe. The EIB, which maintains a top AAA credit rating, is the world's largest borrower and lender in Ecu. Borrowing in the European currency unit accounted for 18 per cent of the total in 1991. Mr Broder said the approach of monetary union and a single European currency would alter the context of the EIB's activities fundamentally, making borrowing and lending even easier. The Luxembourg-based bank's priorities in 1991 were the development of deprived regions of the EC, which benefited from Ecu8.5bn of loans - against Ecu7.4bn in 1990 - and the setting up of an efficient European transport and telecommunications network, for which Ecu3.8bn (Ecu3.1bn) was lent. But the bank also supported EC energy supplies and environmental improvements and approved global loans worth Ecu2.4bn for nearly 10,000 small and medium-sized enterprises. A further Ecu1bn was lent to industrial companies ranging from an Andalucian oil refinery to an Italian ice-cream manufacturer. Italy - historically the biggest beneficiary of EIB loans - won nearly 28 per cent of the EC loans granted, with Spain, the UK and France also the three next largest borrowers. Germany's five new Lander alone received Ecu521m of EIB investment support.</p>

			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 3 FLORIDA CITIES ON EXPANSION LIST;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: SIX AREAS STILL BEING CONSIDERED FOR TWO NEW NATIONAL LEAGUE TEAMS.  SACRAMENTO IS ELIMINATED.  </P> <P> Six cities and prospective ownership groups, including three from Florida, were  chosen today as finalists for two National League expansion teams.  </P> <P> The NL's "short list" is composed of Buffalo, Denver, Miami, Orlando, St.  Petersburg-Tampa and Washington, D.C.  </P> <P> Eliminated were Nashville, Tenn., Charlotte, N.C., Phoenix and Sacramento.  </P> <P> The league has said two new teams will begin play in the 1993 season with final  selection of the franchises expected before the end of next September.  </P> <P> Cubs reliever Mitch Williams, who struggled through the 1990 season after  saving 36 games in 1989, said he wants out of Chicago after the club signed  free-agent reliever Dave Smith.  </P> <P> "They signed Dave so they could get rid of me," Williams said Monday in a  telephone interview from his Arlington, Tex., home.  </P> <P> "I just don't care for the things I've heard about (Manager) Don Zimmer talking  behind my back. There's no question now that I want out of Chicago," he said.  </P> <P> The Daiei Co., Japan's largest supermarket chain, today denied a U.S. news  report that its owner was trying to buy a stake in the New York Yankees.  </P> <P> An Associated Press report from New York last Saturday quoted unspecified  documents as saying that Daiei Chairman Isao Nakauchi was considering buying a  9.6% stake in the Yankees.  </P></p>

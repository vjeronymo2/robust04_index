			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chirawat Na Thalang and Chiwamon Kanoksin] </F>   [Text] A group of Thai businessmen will fly to the United  States in the middle of next month to talk with their American  counterparts on the setting up of the U.S.-Thai Business  Council, which is being established to allow businessmen from  the two countries to exchange views on how to promote future  cooperation.    In preparation for the upcoming meeting, Deputy Prime  Minister Amnuai Wirawan yesterday called a meeting with local  businessmen, including Dr Olan Chaiprawat president of Siam  Commerciai Bank, and Chatri Sophonphanit, executive chairman of  Bangkok Bank Ltd, at Government House to discuss the agenda  which the Thai delegation should raise at the upcoming meeting  with the Americans.    The U.S.-Thai Business Council was initiated at a meeting  between President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Chuan Likphai  late last year, ahead of the Seattle Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation summit. The two leaders agreed that Thailand and the  United States should have a forum to provide a discussion table  for businessmen from the two countries to exchange views on how  to promote bilateral activities.    So far, the bilateral talks between Thailand and the United  States have been dominated by the issue of conflicts such as  intellectual property protection and human rights, instead of  how to seriously promote activities in business and trade.    An official from the U.S. Embassy said that the discussions  will cover areas of interest to both sides. The agenda might  include the outcome of the recently agreed Uruguay Round of  multilateral trade talks. He did not rule out the possibility  that they might discuss how to liberalize trade in services.    The council would consist of high-level economic officials  and representatives of the private sector.    After the meeting, Amnuai told the press that Bangkok and  Washington have agreed to upgrade the existing Thai-U.S.  Leadership Council to become the planned U.S.-Thai Business  Council by promoting the participation of both private and  public sectors.    M.R. Kasemsamoson Kasemsri, former permanent secretary to  the  Foreign Ministry and Thai chairman of the U.S. Thai Leadership  Council, also proposed that the planned joint council should  function under the supervision of the governments of the two  sides, with about 30-50 business representatives.    The council should be convened once a year and the  chairmanship will be rotated.    Moreover, the council should get active participation by the  Board of Trade, Thai Bankers' Association and the Federation of  Thai Industries.    Yesterday's meeting also assigned a committee, comprising  M.R. Kasemsamoson from the state sector, and two representatives  from the private sector to draft the agenda for next month's  discussion, according to Chatri Sophonphanit.    Chatri added that the Thai delegation might have an  opportunity to meet with U.S. Vice President Al Gore, but he  declined to say who will represent the Thai delegation.    Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchapak was scheduled  to  go to the United States this month, but the schedule was  postponed.</p>

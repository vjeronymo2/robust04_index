			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by F. Aryirou--passages in parentheses published in </F> English]    [Text] London--With the confidence-building measures, the  return of all refugees to their homes and property is being  sacrificed and the Cyprus problem is being restricted to the  Famagusta issue. This is the appraisal of [UK] constitutional  expert Mrs. Claire Palley, a consultant for the Cyprus  Government.    According to our information from official Cyprus Government  documents, Mrs. Palley has recommended against accepting the  confidence-building measures. "For a desert that belongs to  them," the English constitutional expert says (meaning  Famagusta), "the return of all the Greek Cypriot refugees is  being sacrificed." The English constitutional expert also  accuses the other experts whom the government has used of giving  distorted opinions because they were ignorant of international  law.    Commenting on the confidence-building measures, Mrs. Palley  maintains: "All the refugees will be sacrificed for the return  of a desert area, that is, Varosha (to get the return of a  desert to which its owners are entitled, all other Greek Cypriot  refugees are being sacrificed-- what used to be called  Famagustization of the Cyprus problem).''    Mrs. Palley also reproaches the experts whom the Cyprus  Government used as consultants on the confidence-building  measures and accuses them of naivete on matters of international  law. The English constitutional expert says that their opinion  ("...just proves the legal and political incompetence of the  experts") and adds: "The experts' naivete in international law  is revealed," [quotation published in English] and that  ("ignorance of international law is revealed by purported  factual statements").</p>

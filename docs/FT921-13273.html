			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Weak credit demand damps recovery hopes DEMAND FOR credit remains subdued, providing little sign of any imminent recovery from the recession, according to Bank of England figures published yesterday. Bank and building society lending to the private sector grew by a seasonally adjusted Pounds 1.1bn last month, about half the figure predicted by the City, while money supply growth remained weak. That increase in M4 lending followed a freak Pounds 5.7bn increase in November. It took growth in the figure back to depressed levels. The data indicate that the desire of companies and individuals to reduce debts, rather than to take on new credit, will continue to hold back the economy. Narrow money or M0, which mostly comprises notes and coins in circulation and indicates underlying demand pressures, rose 0.3 per cent in December compared with November to give a 2.8 per cent increase for the year. The figure, coming after November's year-on-year rise in M0 of 2.9 per cent, underlines the fragility of consumer activity and accords with recent data showing weak retail sales. Broad money or M4 - cash plus bank and building society deposits - rose by 0.8 per cent in December compared with November. Last month's year-on-year increase in M4 was 6.2 per cent, up from November's 5.7 per cent. Much of the change was due to higher monetary growth prompted by the unexpectedly large increase of Pounds 1.2bn in government borrowing in December. The figures from the Bank coincided with a report from Britain's nine biggest commercial banks, which said that last month they lent a net Pounds 39m to the private sector - after a Pounds 3.5bn figure in November which has been dismissed as a statistical quirk. The British Bankers' Association, a trade body for the banks, said December's figures pointed to 'no upturn in lending'. It said that in the past nine months manufacturers had repaid more than Pounds 2bn in debts. Demand from individuals for credit had been 'modest' in recent months. According to detailed figures from the association - which are not adjusted for seasonal variations - retailers last month repaid debts worth Pounds 406m and manufacturers reduced their credit overhang by Pounds 674m. Groups in the financial sector that went against the trend included leasing com-panies and securities dealers, which took on new credit of Pounds 514m and Pounds 518m respectively.</p>

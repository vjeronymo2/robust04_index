			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / World Trade News: EC-Polish car quota row delays venture by Fiat A DISPUTE between Warsaw and the EC over allocation of a Polish 30,000 vehicle duty-free import quota is delaying the planned takeover of Poland's FSM car factory by Fiat Auto of Italy, Christopher Bobinski reports from Warsaw. Talks on sharing out the quota have gone on all year; the Poles hope today's visit to the European Commission by Premier Hanna Suchocka will solve the problem. Fiat is refusing to make a final commitment to the Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1bn) FSM project until it knows how many cars it can import into Poland without paying a 35 per cent tariff. The quota is worth Ecu 100m to western European manufacturers lobbying for duty-free access, which the Poles originally wanted to restrict to Fiat, GM Europe and Volkswagen.</p>

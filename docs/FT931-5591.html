			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Charity says 1m under-25s are jobless ONE MILLION young people under 25 were jobless this January, with the rate of increase outstripping the increase among the general population, figures published yesterday by Youthaid, a charity, show. It said that since the recession started in early 1990 unemployment in the age group had grown by 455,000, an increase of 91 per cent compared with 86 per cent for the general population. Government figures published last week showed the age group had one of the highest percentage increases in long-term unemployment, but the Department of Employment said it 'found no evidence of the huge numbers of young people Youthaid claimed were slipping through the net'. Concern about how best to get jobless young people into the work habit has caused Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, to concentrate on the age group. Proposals being examined include forcing long-term unemployed young people having to take part in some activity - either training or work experience - or risk losing their benefit. The Youthaid figures, drawn from a number of sources including official data, claim government figures underestimate the extent of unemployment in the group by 84,300. The department said there were only 6,744 young people waiting eight weeks or more for a YT place. Colleges criticised by the Audit Commission for high student drop-out rates hit back yesterday with high pass marks. A survey by BTec, the Business and Technology Education Council, showed that as many as 72 per cent of students on work-related diplomas scored pass marks, compared with an average 70 per cent pass rate for the equivalent two A levels on more traditional academic courses.</p>

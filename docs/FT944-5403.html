			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Budget Analysis): Now you can pay in more - Friendly societies THE MEASURE: The maximum payments to life assurance savings plans sold by friendly societies increase from Pounds 200 to Pounds 270 a year and from Pounds 18 to Pounds 25 a month, writes Debbie Harrison. The proceeds on plans cashed in early, now limited to a return of premiums, will be improved. Both changes take effect from when the Finance Bill gets royal assent in May. WHAT IT MEANS: For historic reasons, friendly societies have been allowed to run very tax-efficient savings plans for small savers. Under their qualifying life assurance policies, the fund grows free of tax and the proceeds at maturity are tax-free. The great problem has been the smallness of the amount you can pay in. The increase to Pounds 270 a year will certainly make these policies more attractive, particularly as existing policyholders can also take advantage of the improved terms. The only point to watch with friendly societies is the level of charges, which can be high compared with the level of contributions. From January, these charges must be disclosed before you sign up - so do shop around. Bear in mind that the maximum applies to the individual. You cannot exceed the limit by taking out several policies with different friendly societies. The improvement to early surrender terms is very welcome. Now, if you cash in a qualifying friendly society endowment policy within the first 7 1/2 years, or a whole-life policy within the first 10, it will lose its tax-exempt status. The most you will get back is the premiums you paid in. This restriction will be removed. Lindsay Firth McGuckin, head of marketing at the Liverpool Victoria, says: 'We are pleased we can improve terms for early surrenders, although we will continue to stress that this is a long-term savings contract.'</p>

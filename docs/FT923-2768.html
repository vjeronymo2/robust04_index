			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Observer: Chatterbox Pleased to hear that Sir Christopher Tugendhat, chairman of Abbey National and author of what is generally seen as one of the more offbeat ideas for heaving the British housing market out of the doldrums, has found a soul mate to chat to at board meetings. True to the bank's style of picking 'unconventional' people as its non-executive directors, it has chosen Sir Terence Heiser, who retired as permanent secretary at the Department of the Environment in June. 'His style, way of thinking, and background is not exactly conventional,' enthuses Sir Christopher. In common with the last mandarin non-exec at Abbey - Sir John Garlick who retired last year - Sir Terence has anything but the typical Whitehall background; they both, for instance, joined the civil service straight from school. With his recreation of 'talking', according to Who's Who, he obviously continues to defy the norm for his colleagues. Sir Christopher says he has not been able to discuss his idea of tax breaks for homeowners who have lost money on their bricks and mortar investment, as Sir Terence is still in purdah. For two such chatty men (Sir Christopher lists 'conversation' as one of his Who's Who recreations) this must have been a severe strain.</p>

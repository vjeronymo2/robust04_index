			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Arms plant to halve workforce THE EROSION of jobs in the defence industry continued yesterday with confirmation that Royal Ordnance will almost halve its workforce at Blackburn, Lancashire. Announcing 350 job losses, the armaments subsidiary of British Aerospace warned that the future of the site, which specialises in fuses, was 'entirely dependent upon future order intake'. The plant has already cut 640 jobs since 1990 and the latest cut will reduce the workforce to 370. The company said it hoped the cut would be largely through voluntary means, early retirement and redeployment, but it did not rule out compulsory redundancies. Royal Ordnance's workforce has fallen by 2,000 to about 8,500 since 1990, in spite of its purchase last year of the 1,000-employee German small-arms company Heckler &amp; Koch.</p>

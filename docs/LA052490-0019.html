			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: PORT HUENEME;  </P> <P> SUSPECT IN 20 HOME BURGLARIES ARRESTED  </P> <P> Port Hueneme police on Wednesday arrested a 21-year-old man suspected of  burglarizing as many as 20 houses in the city's south area over the past two  weeks, authorities said.  </P> <P> John Charles Jacobson of Port Hueneme was being held on six counts of burglary  after he was arrested while trying to crawl out the back window of his house in  the 100 block of East C Street, police said.  </P> <P> Detective Dale Harbin, who investigates burglary cases for the Port Hueneme  Police Department, recognized Jacobson from a description given by a woman who  saw the suspect burglarizing her house, Police Sgt. Dennis Fitzgerald said.  </P> <P> Jacobson's fingerprints matched those found in six houses that had been  burglarized of videocassette recorders, jewelry and money, Fitzgerald said.  </P> <P> Police obtained a warrant and searched Jacobson's house but did not find any of  the stolen goods, Fitzgerald said. They believe Jacobson sold the goods  immediately after stealing them, Fitzgerald said. CAROL WATSON  </P></p>

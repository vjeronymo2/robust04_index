			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Monktonhall miners scrap Libya cash plea A CONSORTIUM of coalminers which had been negotiating a financial lifeline with the Libyan government performed a U-turn yesterday in the face of public criticism from its financial advisers and opposition from local politicians in Scotland. Monktonhall Mineworkers, which leases the Monktonhall colliery near Edinburgh from British Coal, announced that if it were to receive an offer of finance from Libya it 'would not consider it or proceed if it were to prove offensive to our customers, the public or any other party'. Mr Jackie Aitchison, chairman of Monktonhall Mineworkers, confirmed that the company had been in touch through a third party with the state-owned Arab Foreign Investment Company (Lafico) about obtaining funding to enable it to continue in business. The intermediary had indicated that investment might be available, he said. Earlier it emerged that Mr Ron Brown, former Labour MP for Leith, who has long-standing contacts with the Libyan government, had put the miners in touch with Lafico. Quayle Munro, the quoted Edinburgh merchant bank being paid by Lothian regional council to advise the consortium and help solve its financial problems, issued a statement saying that the action taken by the miners' representative was 'in all the circumstances ill-conceived'. It said the business of Monktonhall Mineworkers depended on the goodwill of the government, British Coal, power generators and other customers. Mr John Elliot, a director, added that it was 'tactless, to say the least' to engage Libyan support at a time when the Lockerbie bombing was still fresh in people's minds in Scotland. The government is attempting to secure the extradition to Scotland from Libya of two men accused of being involved in the plot to bring down Pan Am flight 101, which crashed on Lockerbie in 1988. Mr David Costello, chairman of Lothian regional council's planning committee, which is working to save Monktonhall, said that the action the miners had taken had been 'absolutely disastrous'. Quayle Munro said it had learned of the approach to Libya only just before it was disclosed in the Scottish media. The merchant bank said in June that Monktonhall needed a capital injection of Pounds 3m to become viable. Although the pit has contracts to sell its coal, it is crippled by lack of finance due to initial underfunding and subsequent operating losses. Its only source of capital was the Pounds 1.8m raised from subscriptions of Pounds 10,000 each from the 180 miners, which has been exceeded by operating losses. However yesterday Quayle Munro said: 'In recent days there may have emerged a hope that a broadly satisfactory solution may be possible.'</p>

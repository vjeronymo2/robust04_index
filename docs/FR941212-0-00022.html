The existing regulation was temporarily amended for the 1994 St. Croix River boating season because the previous opening schedule was contributing to traffic delays and congestion in Stillwater. This revised opening schedule was evaluated through the 1994 St. Croix River boating season. As a result of traffic studies and evaluations, a new opening schedule is being implemented to reduce traffic delays and congestion. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> January 11, 1995. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Roger K.

The Coast Guard received six comments on the proposal. A public meeting was requested and held on April 7, 1994, in the Stillwater Municipal Building. At that meeting the bridge owner, Minnesota Department of Transportation (MNDOT), recommended a revised opening schedule based on traffic data and studies. The Coast Guard decided to issue a temporary regulation which would allow evaluation of MNDOT's proposed changes during the summer boating season. The temporary regulation was published as a Final Temporary Rule on Friday, June 3, 1994 in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 28776). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background and Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The St. Croix River is heavily used by recreational craft. River excursion boats are the only known commercial navigation passing the bridge. To meet the navigational needs of these boaters the S36 Bridge is presently required to open on signal from May 15 through October 15 on a set schedule of hourly and half hourly openings from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. From October 16 through May 14, the draw opens on signal if at least 24 hours notice is given. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In an effort to reduce traffic congestion on the approaches to the bridge, the Mayor of Stillwater requested that the bridge's operating schedule be amended. The Coast Guard proposed a change which would permit hourly openings on weekdays from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. and on Saturdays, Sundays and federal holidays from 8 a.m. to midnight. The two hours advance notice from 10 p.m. to 8 a.m. weekdays, and from midnight to 8 a.m., Saturdays, Sundays and federal holidays would remain in effect. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of Comments and Changes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Coast Guard received six comments on the Proposed Rulemaking. Three supported the proposed change; a fourth, from the Minnesota Historical Society, stated that the proposed action would have no effect on the historic characteristics of the bridge, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Two comments, one from a local recreational boater and the other from the owner of a local marina, objected to the proposed change. As a result of the objections, the Coast Guard requested that MNDOT conduct traffic studies, evaluate the results and recommend an opening schedule that would retain an acceptable number of bridge openings and provide for peak highway traffic. Based on the evaluation of vehicle traffic counts and studies, MNDOT reported that no change was warranted by traffic conditions during weekday morning hours. Because heavy vehicular traffic arrived between 3 p.m. and 7 p.m. on weekdays, MNDOT recommended that the existing schedule be observed up to and including the 2:30 p.m. opening, and that openings after 2:30 p.m. should occur at 4 p.m., 5:30 p.m., 6:30 p.m. and 7 p.m. with an opening every half hour thereafter until 10 p.m. Because heavy vehicular traffic arrived between 9 a.m. and 8 p.m. on weekends and holidays, MNDOT recommended that the existing schedule be retained, up to and including the 9 a.m. opening, and that the opening schedule be revised for one opening per hour from 9 a.m. until 8 p.m. with half hourly openings from 8 p.m. until midnight. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Coast Guard published a Final Temporary Rule promulgating the opening schedule recommended by MNDOT, and requested comments throughout the evaluation period, which ended November 15, 1994. No comments have been received. Accordingly, the Coast Guard is revising the existing regulation to promulgate the opening schedule in effect for the 1994 boating season. <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

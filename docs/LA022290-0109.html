			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> MASSACHUSETTS;  </P> <P> MILITARY SITES LOCKED TO PREVENT SEIZURE  </P> <P> The National Guard locked up all of its buildings in Massachusetts to prevent  other local law enforcement agencies from emulating the Hampden County sheriff,  who commandeered the Springfield, Mass., armory to use as a jail. Sheriff  Michael Ashe moved 15 low-risk inmates into the armory because his jail had  exceeded its occupancy limit. Ashe has been negotiating with the state and  National Guard to determine if another building can be used as a temporary  jail.  </P></p>

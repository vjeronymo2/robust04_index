			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIBERIA FACTION CHIEF THREATENS U.S. MARINES  </P> <P> Rebel leader Prince Johnson, who holds several foreign hostages, said today  that he will attack American Marines at the U.S. Embassy if U.S. or other  foreign troops do not intervene to end Liberia's civil war.  </P> <P> A group of West African countries meeting in Gambia announced today that they  will send a joint military task force to Liberia, but they did not say when it  would be mobilized.  </P> <P> Some of the 235 Marines airlifted into Monrovia to evacuate Americans and other  foreign nationals on Sunday took up defensive positions within the walled U.S.  Embassy compound after Johnson's threat.  </P> <P> Johnson also presented eight foreign hostages to reporters and said he would  not free them until a peacekeeping force comes to this West African nation torn  by a 7-month-old tribal conflict in which 5,000 people have died.  </P> <P> The hostages shown included one American, identified as Chris Mendes, 27, a  mining engineer from Sacramento; three Britons; two Germans; a Dutch national,  and an Argentine. Johnson has pledged not to harm them, but said he would hold  them until an outside force arrives.  </P> <P> Johnson, who killed a relief worker Friday who he said was selling rice to  Monrovia's starving citizens, said he had killed one Liberian congressman for  spying and would kill another.  </P> <P> The hostages were abducted Monday night from Hotel Africa, on the northwestern  outskirts of Monrovia.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 26, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BRITAIN REJECTS EUROPEAN BANK, SINGLE CURRENCY  </P> <P> Britain today rejected plans to create a single European currency and a central  bank but pledged to accept some elements of a plan to form a united European  market by late 1992.  </P> <P> West Germany, however, urged the leaders of the 12-nation European Economic  Community to endorse the single currency and central bank.  </P> <P> Under a plan being considered at an EEC summit in Madrid, member states would  gradually hand over economic policy-making power to the EEC. Surrendering  aspects of national sovereignty is a key issue as the community heads toward  dropping all trade barriers and creating the single market in 1992.  </P> <P> "Decisions on these matters are simply not on the current agenda," British  officials quoted Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as telling the closed-door  summit meeting. "We must stick to the practical and go for what needs to be  done now."  </P> <P> The leaders adjourned for lunch on the first day of the two-day summit with  aides seeking to draw up a compromise position.  </P> <P> West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl pressed the leaders to accept the plan in  its entirety, his spokesman, Hans Klein, said.  </P> <P> As part of endorsing the first stage of the plan, which would begin in July,  1990, Thatcher pledged to link the pound to the other major EEC currencies by  joining the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System.  </P> <P> But a British spokesman, who requested anonymity, said Thatcher said Britain  will join the European Monetary system if Britain's 8.3% inflation rate is  "reduced significantly," if other EEC countries abolish exchange controls by  July, 1990, and if the community allows an open market in banking and financial  services.  </P> <P> Thatcher argued that earlier membership in the currency alignment by Britain  could have shaken the entire system. Britain is the only major oil producer in  the EEC, and the pound is boosted by oil price increases, which tend to depress  the other currencies.  </P></p>

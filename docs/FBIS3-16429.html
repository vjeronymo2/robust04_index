			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] Vitaliy Churkin has arrived in Belgrade after talks  in Zagreb and Sarajevo.    [Begin Churkin recording] We do have some ideas how we can  make further progress toward a political settlement, taking into  account the latest developments, the advancement toward setting  up a Muslim-Croatian federation. What concerns me, for example,  is how the rights of the Serbs, who are one of the peoples  making up the state, will be regarded and ensured in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, which should in our view be preserved as a  territorial, integral state. Will they join the Muslim-Croatian  federation which is currently being set up? It seems to me that  it is of fundamental importance that Croatians and Muslims  possess sovereign rights in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It should be  obvious that the Serbs should have the same sovereign rights,  too. [end recording] [Video shows Churkin being interviewed at  airport]</p>

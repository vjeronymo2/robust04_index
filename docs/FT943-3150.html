			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / International Company News: Woodchester plans to invest IPounds 120m surplus Woodchester Investment, the Dublin-based leasing and banking group, said yesterday that it had IPounds 120m (Pounds 118m) of surplus capital which it planned to invest in its core business. The surplus capital has proved a drain on earnings, as falling interest rates cost the group about IPounds 3m at the interim stage, and resulted in a decline in pre-tax profits from IPounds 16.4m to IPounds 14.9m for the first half of 1994. Mr Dan O'Connor, deputy group chief executive, said Woodchester was interested in expanding its UK operations through acquisitions. At present about 75 per cent of UK profits come from vehicle financing, with the remainder from small unit finance. The existing UK operations saw significant improvements in profits and new business during the period. Woodchester is in a process of consolidation after a radical restructuring of its Irish operations, which resulted in IPounds 15m reorganisation costs last year. The reorganisation followed a period of rapid expansion. Mr O'Connor said the redundancy programme had been completed, and its provisions would be 'more than adequate'. Credit Lyonnais increased its stake from 49 to 53 per cent during the period, and Woodchester said the French banking group was committed to developing its Irish subsidiary as its vehicle finance arm in Europe. Woodchester is taking on Credit Lyonnais Leasing Europe's businesses in Denmark and Portugal, and is looking to extend its operations in other European markets. It expressed confidence in the future by increasing its dividend by 15 per cent to 2.39p (2.08p), in spite of earnings falling from 6.37p to 5.53p.</p>

			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Financial advertising attacked THE standard of financial advertising has been condemned as 'abysmal', with many adverts attacked for being misleading. In the latest edition of its magazine Which?, the Consumers' Association says: 'In general the quality of information on financial products is abysmal. Breaches of the rules governing financial advertising are widespread.' The association's examples include two advertisements from different building societies which each claimed they had the best-performing Tessa (tax exempt special savings account) of 1991. Britannia's claim was based only on the 10 largest building societies, while Yorkshire's ranking was based on the larger banks and the 13 largest building societies. The association also says the Britannia advert failed to mention restrictions on its accounts such as the inability to withdraw interest. Britannia responded: 'Whenever an investor applies for one of our products he or she receives the relevant product literature detailing the full terms and conditions.' A newspaper advertisement from Robert Fleming included statistics showing that over 10 years its investment trusts had performed better than average. In the same newspaper a table showed that the company's trusts had underperformed over the past three years. Which? says that consumers should treat claims and statistics with caution. Midland's advertisement for its capital bond fails to mention that the bond, while matching the rise in the FT-SE 100 Index over five years, fails to pay investors the dividend yield, an important component of equity returns. Midland said that it was adjusting the advertisement to refer to stock market 'growth' instead of 'returns'. Imro and Lautro, the financial-service regulators, are criticised for secrecy. The association says: 'Imro and Lautro deal with complaints in private and only rarely publish details of decisions.' Substantial savings can be made by private motorists importing a new car from some continental European markets rather than purchasing it in the UK, according to Which? After research among car dealers in Belgium and the Netherlands the magazine says that savings of up to Pounds 2,131 can be made on the UK price of a Ford Fiesta 1.3iLX. Price quotes made by two Audi dealers offered a saving of Pounds 2,176 over the UK price of an Audi 80.</p>

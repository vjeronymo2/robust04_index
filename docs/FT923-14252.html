			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / (CORRECTED) Reprimands for account deviations Correction (published 9th July 1992) appended to this article. THE FINANCIAL Reporting Review Panel said it had publicly reprimanded four companies for deviations from accounting standards. They were: Williams Holdings, Ultramar, Shield Group and Forte. In its first annual report, the accounting watchdog said it had received 63 referrals and was still examining 21 while 36 were not being pursued. Correction (published 9th July 1992) IN THE FT yesterday, we reported that Forte was one of four companies reprimanded by the Financial Reporting Review Panel for deviations from accounting standards. In fact, the review panel said it was satisfied with Forte's explanations in respect of four matters brought to its attention, and had concluded there was no cause for action. We regret the error.</p>

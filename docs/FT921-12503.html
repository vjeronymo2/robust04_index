			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Civil servants to hold one-day strike in London MORE THAN two thirds of London's civil servants have been ordered by their unions to strike next Friday in 24-hour stoppages that may close government buildings including libraries and galleries. Members of the CPSA and NUCPS Civil Service unions working in the capital have voted to authorise the strikes in protest against the government's refusal to raise London weighting in each of the past three years. The action by up to 45,000 civil servants will affect Jobcentres and the passport office and may cause difficulties at airport Customs operations. Union leaders said workers at the Tate Gallery, the Natural History Museum, the British Museum, the British Library, the Equal Opportunities Commission and the Commonwealth Institute would be asked to strike, forcing some institutions to close. Members of the other Civil Service unions, which have higher-paid and more senior members, are expected to work normally. Members of the Inland Revenue Staff Federation voted against a strike. In the NUCPS ballot 3,867 voted for a strike and 2,770 against. The CPSA vote was 4,579 to 3,113. The turnouts were 30 per cent and 33 per cent respectively. The Treasury stopped increasing London weighting allowances after 1988, targeting resources instead on increasing basic pay for some London staff and introducing local pay additions for workers who are hard to recruit and retain. The unions are angry because some workers have not received local pay additions or basic-pay rises for working in London. Some, including support grades in the NUCPS, have received neither. Mr Leslie Christie, NUCPS general secretary, said that in some cases London weighting of Pounds 1,750 for central London amounted to 25 per cent of salary. The unions are claiming a central London allowance of Pounds 2,155, Pounds 1,230 for five to 10 miles (the current allowance is Pounds 1,000) and Pounds 925 for 10 to 18 miles (Pounds 725).</p>

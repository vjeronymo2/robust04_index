			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HERNANDEZ DOES IT ALL AS BREA-OLINDA RIPS ANAHEIM  </P> <P> Marco Hernandez is a scoring threat just about every time his foot or hands  touch the football for Brea-Olinda High School.  </P> <P> Hernandez, a sophomore kicker and tailback, who also triples as a defensive  back, scored the Wildcats' first touchdown and kicked three extra points in a  27-7 Orange League victory over Anaheim Friday night in front of 2,7000 at  Brea.  </P> <P> Hernandez carried the ball only two times for 28 yards, including a 11-yard  touchdown run with 7:57 remaining in the first half to give Brea-Olinda a 7-0  lead.  </P> <P> "Last week, we decided we had to start him (even though senior tailback Ed  Stewart, a 1,000-yard rusher, was healthy)," Brea-Olinda Coach John Looney  said. "(Hernandez) just makes things happen."  </P> <P> Hernandez also accounted for one of four interceptions thrown by Anaheim's Chad  Campbell.  </P> <P> Stewart led Brea-Olinda with 77 yards rushing and a touchdown early in the  third quarter to give the Wildcats a 21-0 lead.  </P> <P> Brea-Olinda senior quarterback Chad Marlow passed for touchdowns of 43 and 23  yards. The first went to tight end Jon Kobz and the second to wide receiver  Ryan Nicholson, his fifth touchdown of the season.  </P> <P> The victory evens the Wildcats league record at 1-1, and comes on the heels of  their first defeat of the season to Western last week. Brea-Olinda is 6-1  overall. Anaheim is 2-5 overall and 0-2 in league play.  </P> <P> "We were 5-0, fat and happy," Looney said. "Western was 4-1 and hungry. (This  week) we wanted to show what the kids were made of."  </P></p>

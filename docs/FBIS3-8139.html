			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, March 3 (CTK) -- Jan Slota, chairman of  the minor government coalition partner, the Slovak National  Party (SNS), said on Wednesday night that "the Slovak, not the  communist-Hungarian cause will win" in early parliamentary  elections. Early elections, the date of which has not been set  as yet, are seen by both the government and the opposition as a  solution to the current political crisis in Slovakia.    Speaking at a meeting of the government coalition, which is  also formed by Premier Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), Slota stressed that his party would  not allow Slovaks to become an ethnic minority in the country's  south. Southern Slovakia is home to most of the 560,000 ethnic  Hungarians living in the country and constituting almost 11 per  cent of its total population.    Slota hailed the departure of a group of people around the  former SNS chairman, Ludovit Cernak, as "cleansing the party of  the people who thought that the SNS could be built up on civic  principles."    Parliament Deputy Chairman Augustin Marian Huska (HZDS)  commented on the evident disharmony between the Castle, seat of  President Michal Kovac, and Meciar saying that "the government  is to govern and the president is to represent (the country)".    Kovac has refused to accept Meciar's candidates for the  posts  of privatization and foreign ministers, Ivan Lexa and Jozef  Prokes, respectively. He has also decided not to call a  referendum on stripping the deputies who have left the parties  for which they had been elected of their mandates because this  contradicted the constitution, as Kovac's spokesman Anton Bodis  put it.    Huska called on the Slovaks to rid themselves of their  "slavish souls" and to demonstrate their ability to defend their  statehood. He stressed that since the times of (9th-century)  Prince Pribina "we have been endangered."    Deputy Premier and SNS honorary Chairman Jozef Prokes said  Kovac probably had refused to put him in charge of the Foreign  Ministry (to replace Jozef Moravcik, HZDS, who resigned last  week) because "I dared to express the doubt that the best way of  conducting talks with (U.S. President Bill) Clinton (during his  January visit to Prague) was to read him a half-hour lecture."    Meciar called Kovac's meeting with Clinton "a historically  wasted opportunity."    Prokes called false the claims that it was not possible to  cooperate with Meciar because his own case testified to the  contrary.</p>

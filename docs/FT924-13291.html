			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Pentland criticised as talks fail PENTLAND'S DECISION to call off negotiations with Bernard Tapie Finance (BTF) over the purchase of Adidas, the sports shoe company, led to a characteristically fiery attack from Mr Tapie, and a characteristically reserved response from Pentland. Mr Tapie accused Pentland of trying to renegotiate the price of the purchase, agreed in July, while Pentland said it had found problems which BTF had been unable to resolve. Because of a confidentiality agreement, Pentland and its advisers refused to comment on what problems they had unearthed. But behind the recriminations must lie a profound sense of disappointment on all sides that a deal with remarkable internal logic and cohesion appears to be off. Pentland, with net cash of more than Pounds 250m from the sale of a stake in Reebok, US sports shoe maker, wanted another international brand to nurture. Adidas had the brand but needed new investment to revive it. Mr Tapie needed the money to restore his business empire, which has been in decline since he bought Adidas in a highly leveraged deal in 1990. Mr Frank Farrant, Pentland finance director, said the company's outstanding 20 per cent stake in Adidas, acquired last year, would be retained even though a new agreement with Mr Tapie was unlikely, especially given the ferocity of his attacks on Pentland yesterday. 'From our point of view the deal is now dead,' Mr Farrant said. This leaves Adidas with the same problems which have constrained its growth since Mr Tapie's takeover, a lack of cash. BTF said yesterday it would invest 'between FFr500m and FFr600m (Pounds 60m to Pounds 70m)' in Adidas and discuss with other minority shareholders, a group dominated by Credit Lyonnais and Banque Worms, the French banks, and the Assurances Generales de France insurance group. Mr Tapie said they needed 'to discuss ways of saving Adidas as quickly as possible'. It has had serious financial problems and is on course for another year of losses. However it is not clear whether BTF would be able to finance its share of such a capital injection. Mr Tapie has in the past made unfulfilled promises to provide capital for Adidas. Even if the investment is made, it will not be enough to solve Adidas' problems. It has been slow to take advantage of cheaper production in the Far East, and its margins are about 1.5 per cent compared nearly 15 for rivals Nike and Reebok. It has an inadequate share, about 2 per cent, of the world's largest sports shoe market in the US, and its brand name needs reviving in other major markets. 'It is potentially a great brand,' an industry observer said. 'But the costs, financial and political, of closing factories in Europe will be very high. And the days of premium branding and ridiculous prices for sports shoes seem to be over,' he said. Adidas' future is further complicated because at least some clauses of an exclusivity agreement between BTF and Pentland remain in place. This would appear to guarantee Pentland some first refusal over any sales of Adidas shares, and could frustrate attempts by Mr Tapie to sell the company to a third party. Pentland's future is equally uncertain, although the company's cash pile allows it time to consider its options. It has a collection of smaller brand names, like swimwear group Speedo, which it is developing. But the company's ambitions to manage a major brand have been frustrated again. Analysts confessed to a sense of deja vu. Pentland tried in 1988 to take over Parker, the pen maker, but pulled out when certain environmental indemnities were not forthcoming. According to BTF's advisers, the conservatism and caution of Mr Stephen Rubin, Pentland chairman, helped scupper the deal because he kept insisting on more and more guarantees. Pentland's advisers claimed that Pentland had to be cautious because of the nature and complexity of Mr Tapie's group.</p>

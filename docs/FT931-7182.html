			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa pact delegates given weekend deadline COCOA PRODUCING and consuming countries have been told that they must agree on a package of price stabilisation measures by the weekend if they want an International Cocoa Agreement with economic provisions. If no agreement was reached, said Mr Peter Lai of Malaysia, the chairman of UN-sponsored talks on a new accord, he would use the remaining week of this fourth and final round of negotiations to conclude a purely administrative pact to replace the 1986 agreement, which expires on September 30. On Monday, the first day of the two-week negotiating session, Mr Lai put forward compromise proposals on the price range to be defended and on financing of the scheme. The proposals, which are still being considered by the two sides, effectively split the difference between the price demands of producers and consumers and provide for all pact members to share the costs of the scheme. The suggested price range of SDR1,040-1,560 a tonne, with a median price of SDR1,300 (Dollars 1,780) is well above present market levels of about SDR730 a tonne and could only be defended if producers stuck to their expressed intention of reining back production. Earlier this week, the 45 or so producing and consuming countries taking part in the talks agreed in principle on a limit of 350,000 tonnes to the amount of cocoa that could be withheld from the market to support prices. The 40 members of the accord account for about three-quarters of world production and consumption, the most notable absentees being the US, the biggest consumer, and Malaysia, the fourth largest producer.</p>

The 3,300-ton mine layer, which boasts the latest weapons,  shooting control equipment and advanced navigation system, left  Sweden on Jan. 4 for a round-the-world trip and has visited  Morocco, Hawaii and Japan, crossing the Atlantic and Pacific  Oceans.    Carlskrona, the first Swedish Navy vessel to stop in South  Korea, is expected to help promote bilateral relations.    The students and navy men plan to visit the truce village of  Panmunjom, folk village in Yong-in and other major historical  sites before sailing for Hong Kong.    The ship will also visit Bangkok, Malaysia, India, Pakistan,  Turkey and Spain before returning to Sweden in May.</p>

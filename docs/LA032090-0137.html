			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HUNTINGTON BEACH RESCINDS HEIGHT LIMIT ON HEDGES  </P> <P> The City Council voted unanimously Monday night to eliminate a height limit for  trees and hedges along property lines.  </P> <P> During an emotional public hearing, several residents urged the council to  scrap the tree-height ordinance, arguing that many trees would die if cut back  to the six feet required by the law.  </P> <P> But in rebuttal, some other residents pleaded with the city to not only keep  the ordinance but to enforce it. They argued that tall trees along property  lines are being misused in some cases and are hurting neighboring property  values.  </P> <P> In the end, the council voted 7 to 0 to change the law so that neither trees  nor hedges of any type are governed by the height requirement. The council said  residents who have problems with tall trees or hedges can instead use a state  law that allows for civil litigation in such matters.  </P> <P> At issue was a little-known city ordinance that jeopardized thousands of trees  that border property lines. The ordinance limited the height of hedges to six  feet. But the city had interpreted the law to include trees if they were used  as hedges.  </P> <P> The tree law first came before the council last November, when Glen and Jerri  Hesprich appealed to save the tall Italian cypress trees in their back yard.  The Hespriches said that the city staff had ordered their 20- to 30-foot  cypresses cut down to six feet. However, a professional arborist said such a  radical trim would kill the trees, the Hespriches said.  </P> <P> Council members, in November, expressed surprise at the tree-height law and  ordered a moratorium on its enforcement. The council also asked the city staff  to recommend a change in the law.  </P></p>

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Busines and the Environment: Waste swap shop Thousands of tonnes of industrial waste that would otherwise have been dumped is being recycled, thanks to a small UK company, Waste Exchange Services, based in Stockton-on-Tees. James Donaldson, head of WES, brings together waste-producers and companies that can use the waste. He expects to have arranged uses for 30,000 tonnes a year soon, saving industry an estimated Pounds 500,000. His clients include BP, National Power and ICI. Donaldson says waste is only valuable if someone within a reasonable distance can use it, and the deal helps the waste provider and the user. He has built up a database of 1,500 companies offering or able to use waste and publishes a catalogue listing materials wanted or on offer. He is also raising money from outside investors to develop new processes. One of his most innovative projects is the world's first plant for recycling the silica gel used to keep electronic equipment dry. He also sent 50 tonnes of stainless steel rings discarded by an oil refinery to a chemical company that was upgrading its process towers. Ammonium fluoride intended, but not suitable, for the electronics industry went to a metals company. A textile factory is producing sulphate of ammonia fertiliser from the absorption of its ammonia emissions in sulphuric acid. Chemical waste is used to make cement. Previously unwanted lead oxide dust from British Steel goes to a lead recycler. Selenium from old photocopier drums goes into metal alloys. Donaldson used to be a chemical engineer for Davy McKee. He set up his own company when ICI asked him to design a recycling plant. The ICI contract gave him the cash to get going. He now charges 25 per cent of first-year savings from his exchange deals, and hopes turnover will exceed Pounds 100,000 this year.</p>

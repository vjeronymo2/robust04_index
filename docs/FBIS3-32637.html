			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] As we reported in the beginning, Army General Raul  Castro Ruz, minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR],  has paid a visit to the province of Holguin.    Army Gen. Raul Castro Ruz, secretary of the Cuban Communist  Party [PCC], has visited a large FAR unit which belongs to the  Western Army and which is headed by Division Gen. Ulises Rosales  del Toro. The minister was accompanied by Division Gen. Ramon  Espinoza Martin, chief of the General Staff and chief of the  Western Army; Francisco Garcia Ferrer, first PCC secretary in  Holguin; other members of the PCC Central Committee, generals,  and high-ranking officers.    The unit chief, Colonel Carlos (Negrin) Rodriguez, briefed  the minister about the results attained during the past year,  and the prospects for this year, stressing the seven main tasks  of the Western Army. He verified the progress achieved in the  training of personnel, maintenance of armaments and of the  theater of military operations, morale and discipline, and the  fighting capacity of the troops.    The work carried out in livestock production can be clearly  seen in the 30-percent higher growth than last year. An example  of the creativity in this area is the production of milk: larger  cattle farms in larger units; minicattle farms in smaller units;  and goat milk production in the more distant, smallest units.  The agricultural and livestock plan for 1994 seeks steps beyond  those of the previous year, making the troops almost  self-sufficient, to the point of providing a modest food  provision to the families of the officers' corps.    The minister and his retinue visited the combat operations  center directed by Brigadier Gen. Ruben Martinez Puentes, chief  of the DAAFAR [Antiaircraft Defense and Revolutionary Air  Force], and Col. (Negrin) Rodriguez. Raul here greeted the  soldiers and the many female personnel who work at the National  Airspace Defense screens.    At the flight ramp, the FAR minister was shown various types  of equipment for air safety built by the rationalizers  [racionalizadores] and innovators who replace the numerous forms  of equipment that used to be imported, but which today would  demand a considerable amount of currency.    Raul also held a lively conversation with Comrade (Raciel  Bovines), a civilian worker who has been in the unit for 18  years, a National Vanguard member for the past three years, and  whose contributions are decisive solutions for the Air Force  operation.    At the technical research unit, master engineer, (Raul  Trinchet), graduate of the Technical Military Institute, showed  the Army general other achievements in fighter plane repair, and  the creation of basic materials for study. Proof of the quality  of work is the fact that no aircraft from this unit has  experienced an accident due to technical failure over the past  three years. During the chat with Raul, Master Engineer  (Trinchet) said that his efforts are inspired by the  metaphorical words of the minister when he said that inventions  during the special period could reach the point of flying an  aircraft by a gasoline-operated generator.    [Begin recording] [Raul] [passage indistinct] ... from  generals to the last soldier, to civilian workers, technicians,  and engineers, you are a good example. So, allow me to  congratulate you on behalf of the commander in chief, on behalf  of my fellow comrades who are accompanying me, and for myself,  wishing you greater success because now, as I told (Trinchet) a  few minutes ago, that our technicians, engineers, experts,  having reached an accomplished level, life is forcing us to  develop even further. We must admire this, especially since you  are responsible for such a fate. [sentence indistinct]    But that is not the essential point. The essential thing is  that with what we have, we are capable of solving problems such  as those you have solved. Is that correct, Comander?    [Unidentified colonel] Yes, General.    [Raul] Then, I ask my comrades who are accompanying me, that  as a humble homage to you, and through you to everyone  throughout the country, to recognize that our air force, our  DAAFAR, and our Armed Forces have achieved and have greatly  contributed to maintaining the fighting capacity of our FAR, and  in an increasingly less expensive manner, as we said recently.    We are going to have, or are continuing to have the most  powerful Armed Forces in Latin America, and besides, the least  costly Armed Forces. And you here play an essential role,  repairing an engine, or carrying out some of those activities  that Engineer (Trinchet) just explained.    (Negrin), we are talking here about millions of dollars.  [passage indistinct] I ask for applause for these officers, our  comrades. [applause] [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LOARA'S GROUND GAME RUNS DOWN MAGNOLIA  </P> <P> Loara High School might be called too one-dimensional, but that's fine by Coach  Herb Hill.  </P> <P> "I'll take a win any way I can get it," Hill said. "We'll face reality next  week when we play El Modena."  </P> <P> This week, the Saxons' first priority was to establish the run, which they did  effectively and early in a 38-0 victory over Magnolia Friday night at Handel  Stadium.  </P> <P> Loara senior tailback Coy Collins rushed for 194 yards in 17 carries, and  scored four of the team's six touchdowns.  </P> <P> The Saxons gained 387 yards rushing, using nine ballcarriers.  </P> <P> "We wanted to run tonight," Hill said. "The running game is our thing, but you  do have to have some balance."  </P> <P> But the Saxons (4-0) were not exactly balanced. They completed only one of two  passes for six yards. A third attempt resulted in a pass-interference penalty.  </P> <P> Defensively, the Saxons also dominated Magnolia (0-4). Quarterback Elliot  Parker had three passes intercepted and was sacked four times. DENNIS KAISER  </P></p>

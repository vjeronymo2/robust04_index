			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Survey of Egypt (9): Wider still and deeper runs the waterway's future - The Suez Canal Authority faces competition A Russian supertanker and a Moldovian bulk carrier glide peacefully between the sand banks of the Suez Canal. Along the edge of the 125 year old waterway, young conscripts watch idly in the sun as the tankers are piloted past. The days are long gone when the far bank bristled with Israeli armaments and the canal was blocked by sunken ships. Now the canal authorities face new challenges: world recession and a competitor oil pipeline. The number of ships passing through the canal in October and November 1992 was about 10 per cent lower than in the same month in 1991. Last year, the number of transits dropped from 18,221 in 1990-1991, to 17,473. Tonnage fell from 419m tons to 408m. In spite of this, an increase in tolls at the beginning of 1992 meant that revenues rose by 10 per cent - to a record Dollars 1.86bn - in the financial year 1991-1992, compared with the previous year. The Suez Canal Authority (SCA) is now concentrating its energies on a project which will allow bigger ships to pass through the canal, improving competitiveness against the Cape route and the Sumed oil pipeline which has deprived the canal of a share of its trade from giant oil tankers. Sumed, which provides an alternative to the Suez Canal route for oil between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean, is owned by a consortium of Gulf Arab oil producers and Egypt. An expansion scheme, to be completed by next year, involves the addition of a pumping station half way - an increase in storage capacity and an improvement in loading and unloading facilities at both ends. In response, the SCA has started to deepen the Suez canal's draught from 53ft (16 metres) to 56ft (17 metres). This will allow ships of up to 180,000 dead weight tons to pass through it fully loaded. The project also involves widening the canal. According to Mr Mohammed Ezzat Adel, chairman of the SCA, a more ambitious project to deepen the canal to up to 72ft, enabling it to carry ships of up to 300,000 dwt, had to be shelved after feasibility studies showed it to be unprofitable. Such a project will have to wait until world trade reaches new levels, he says. 'Freight trades are very low. Now is not the time to embark on the implementation of such a monstrous project.' To keep abreast with world trade, however, the authority is continuing to review the way in which tolls are levied. Although tariffs increased last year, they averaged only 3 per cent, a slight drop in real terms. Meanwhile, a system of discounts has been introduced to woo ships away from the Cape route. Large tankers can get rebates of up to 50 per cent, while even more generous discounts are offered to ships coming from the Far East, Western Europe, the US and Australia. The latest discounts are expected to increase revenues by about 5 per cent this year. Any ship choosing the Cape route over the canal because of expense is invited by the SCA to submit a breakdown of costs, allowing the authority to examine the competitiveness of its tolls. Mr Adel is confident that the Suez canal will have a successful decade. He believes that financing further deepening and widening of the canal will not be difficult when the SCA decides the time is right. The cost of the complete project - deepening the canal to 72ft - has been estimated at about Dollars 350m. Borrowing such sums from the Egyptian government, at a time when the IMF is pressing it to cut its budget deficit, might not be possible. But Mr Adel says loans from the Gulf Arab states and the offer of soft loans from Japan mean there would be no 'bottle-necks' in financing phase two of the expansion scheme. 'Financing is not considered a problem in the development of this internaional waterway which serves world trade and the economy of Egypt,' says Mr Adel. As for competition from Sumed, Mr Farouk Mohamed Nadi Abou-Taleb, director of the SCA's management department, admits that the expansion project of the pipeline will take trade away from the Suez Canal. But he points out that the income from oil tankers nowadays is about 25 per cent of the canal's total revenues. 'The canal doesn't depend particularly on oil,' he says. 'Dry cargo represents the main factor affecting the income of the Suez Canal.' As world shipping trade recovers and peace talks in the middle east progress, Mr Adel (who describes the canal as a thermometer not just of world trade but of world peace) is optimistic. He believes that the 195km canal, which takes only 15 hours to navigate, will continue to attract the world's shipping fleets. In the meantime the authority will 'take small steps' towards its ultimate goal of being able to transport even the biggest carriers.</p>

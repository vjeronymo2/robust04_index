			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NCAA DECIDES THREE-POINT DISTANCE TO REMAIN SAME, LENGTHENS TIMEOUTS  </P> <P> The distance for the three-point field goal will remain the same in college  basketball, but timeouts will be lengthened by 15 seconds and two free throws  will be awarded for all technical fouls, the National Collegiate Athletic Assn.  basketball rules committee decided Monday.  </P> <P> In addition, the committee agreed that conferences could experiment with  allowing players to accumulate six personal fouls before leaving the game and  giving three free throws to a player fouled while trying a three-point shot.  </P> <P> The changes were announced just before the national championship game was  played.  </P> <P> In keeping the three-point distance at 19 feet 9 inches, the rules committee  went against the recommendation of many coaches who would like to see that  distance lengthened.  </P> <P> "The overall accuracy actually went down . . . plus the feeling is there's  nothing wrong with it," said Ed Steitz, executive secretary of the rules  committee.  </P> <P> "It's given a new dimension to the game and it's added excitement."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 25 (XINHUA) -- More AIDS cases among  people at hospitals have been found with heroin-related  emergencies and this as many fear is the start of a new heroin  epidemics, according to a report released at a U.S. House  hearing today.    For people 35-year old and older with AIDS, heroin  emergencies rose from 422 in 1990 to 2,128 in 1992, the report  said.    Overall, heroin-related hospital emergencies soared 44  percent in the first six months of 1993 over the same 1992  period.    A recent official study also shows a 45 percent in PCP  (pentachlorophenol) emergencies and a 61 percent rise in  methamphetamine use in the United States.    Experts estimate the number of heroin addicts across the  United States at more than half a million and the number is  still growing, today's "USA TODAY" reported.    A report issued by the White House Drug Policy Control  Office  earlier this month cited marked increases in heroin use in the  southwest, west and parts of the south of the United States, as  well as in major cities like Washington, Boston, Denver and Los  Angeles.    Part of the attraction is heroin's purity, the paper said,  adding that street doses can be more than five times as potent  as they were a decade ago.</p>

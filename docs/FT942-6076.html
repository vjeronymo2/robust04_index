			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / International Company News: Dasa and Aerospatiale plan joint ventures Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), the aerospace arm of the German Daimler-Benz group, and Aerospatiale, the French state-owned aerospace operation, intend to form two joint ventures - one to build guided missiles and the other to build satellites. Munich-based Dasa said yesterday that talks with the French company over the terms of the joint ventures had reached an advanced stage and it was likely the new companies would be formed from January 1 next year. Dasa and Aerospatiale have worked together in the guided missile area for decades. The companies believe that a formal joint venture is the best way of co-operating further. The joint ventures are likely to be structured around two holding companies, one for guided missiles which will be established in Paris and a satellite company in Germany. Each of the holding companies will be parent to a German and a French subsidiary, which will divide the work equally between themselves. Both Aerospatiale and Dasa plan to concentrate all their activities in these business areas within the new holding companies. Dasa and Aerospatiale already operate Eurocopter, a helicopter joint venture. Earlier this month Mr Louis Gallois, Aerospatiale's chairman, said that joint ventures were planned as part of a strategy of returning to profitability.</p>

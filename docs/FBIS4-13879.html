			<p>BFN     [Text] Amman--Three Iraq diplomats have returned home from  Beirut after Lebanon broke diplomatic links with their country  over an assassination of an Iraqi dissident in the Lebanese  capital.    The three, including Charge d'Affaires 'Awad Fakhri, flew to  Amman aboard a royal Jordanian (RJ) flight Thursday morning.  Two of their colleagues were arrested by Lebanese police as  they got out of their diplomatic-plate cars at Beirut airport to  board the flight.    The arrest of the two raised to four the number of Iraqi  diplomats held in Beirut over the April 12 killing of Shaykh  Talib 'Ali al-Suhayl, who was reported to have been a key figure  in a foiled plot against Iraqi President Saddam Husayn last year.    Mr. Fakhri had demanded that the Lebanese Government, which  broke diplomatic ties with Iraq after Baghdad refused to lift  the diplomatic immunity for the two attaches, Muhammad Kazim and  Khalid Khalaf release the two diplomats. He also refused to  hand over another attache, 'Ali Darwish, and guard Hadi Hassan,  the suspected assassin, who were holed up in the Iraqi embassy  in Beirut since the day of assassination.    A Lebanese-Armenian employee of the embassy, George  Teredjian, who allegedly drove the assassination team to  al-Suhayl's apartment in Beirut, has also been detained and  charged with complicity.    It was not immediately clear how the embassy stand-off  ended,  given the tough statements that Mr. Fakhri had been issuing  demanding the release of Mr. Kazim and Mr. Khalaf.    But analysts speculated that the Iraqis realised that they  could be in for a long siege by Lebanese police or be exposed to  a possible storming of the embassy after Friday, the date set by  the Beirut government for them to leave the country and thus the  effective end to diplomatic immunity for the building.    They also noted that the Lebanese government had instructed  its lone diplomat in Baghdad, Sa'd Zakhya, to leave Iraq  immediately after the arrest of the two Iraqi diplomats in  Beirut.    Mr. Zakhya left Baghdad in the early hours of April 13,  shortly after the Beirut arrests, and flew out of Amman for the  Lebanese capital on April 14.    Mr. Darwish and Mr. Hassan were arrested as they arrived at  Beirut airport to board the flight to Amman on Thursday along  with Charge d'Affaires Fakhri and two other diplomats, whose  names were not immediately available. But one of them was  believed to be the Beirut correspondent of the IRAQI NEWS AGENCY  (INA).    Mr. Fakhri and the other two were allowed to board the  flight. The Associated Press reported that they were carrying 15  pieces of baggage weighing 350 kilogrammes, including boxes of  files and electronic appliances.    Journalists covering their arrival at Amman airport reported  tight Iraqi security that prevented from talking to any of the  three, who were met by the Iraqi ambassador in Jordan, Nuri al-  Wayyis al-Tikriti and other Iraqi diplomats.    A small scuffle broke out as some Iraqi security men sought  to seize television films of the arrival of the diplomats from  Lebanon, news agencies reported. The row was settled with  intervention by Jordanian security forces, who upheld the right  of the media to cover the event, the reports said.    The three who arrived from Beirut were directly driven from  Amman airport on the 1,000-kilometre trip to Baghdad, the  Associated Press quoted Iraqi embassy spokesman 'Adil Ibrahim as  saying.    There was no immediate report from Baghdad of the diplomats'  arrival there.    The Iraqi government has denied Lebanese Prosecutor General  Munir 'Uwaydat that its intelligence apparatus had ordered the  killing of al-Suhayl, who held Jordanian and Saudi passports and  was a known opponent of the Ba'thist regime in Baghdad.    According to reports in the Lebanese press quoting  "confessions" by the two attaches arrested immediately after the  killing, the order for the assassination had come from Baghdad  over the telex. The operation was allegedly masterminded by Mr.  Darwish.    Charge d'Affaires Fakhri was called in by prosecutors to  hear  the confession of the two, the reports said.    An Iraqi Foreign Minister spokesman has accused Lebanon of  violating the 1961 international convention and regulates  diplomatic immunity.    "It has detained diplomats who possess diplomatic  immunity...  charging them with baseless accusation," the spokesman said in a  statement issued on Wednesday.</p>

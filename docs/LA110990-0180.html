			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> VOLVOS TOUGH, BUT FINALLY CRUSHED IN AD REBUTTAL  </P> <P> Hot rod enthusiasts today saw that a 13,000-pound "monster truck" could indeed  crush a Volvo, but not without a little trouble.  </P> <P> In response to a television commercial that Volvo has pulled from the air, the  U.S. Hot Rod Assn. staged a demonstration of the power of a monster truck  against a Volvo in the parking lot of the Spectrum sports arena.  </P> <P> The ad had appeared to show Volvo as the only car left relatively intact after  a monster truck called Bearfoot ran over a line of autos. It was later learned  that the Volvo in the ad had been reinforced, and the embarrassed company  withdrew the ad this week.  </P> <P> Today, with TV crews and a small crowd gathered, Bearfoot had another go at the  Swedish car.  </P> <P> This time, the junked Volvos were no match over the long haul. But Bearfoot and  two other monster trucks, Predator and Black Stallion, needed a few swipes to  get the job done. The roar of the trucks drowned the crowd's cheers with each  pass.  </P> <P> Predator crushed a line of five cars -- a Pontiac, three Chevys and a Volvo in  the middle. The roof of the Volvo wagon held up enough that it apparently would  have protected passengers.  </P> <P> Then Black Stallion took one run at a line of six Volvos, breaking them in for  four runs by Bearfoot. One on the end gave the trucks particular trouble.  Bearfoot finally finished by coming at an angle to smash roof supports on one  that had remained standing.  </P> <P> Bearfoot driver Todd Blaeser said he was surprised by how well the Volvos held  up. But, asked if Volvo had passed the test, he looked at the pile of six  crushed cars with his truck on top of it and said, "It doesn't look like it,  does it?"  </P> <P> "We've run into Volvos that have stood out in a pile of cars as being tougher,"  said Blaeser, 23, of Chippewa Falls, Wis.  </P> <P> Volvo spokesman Robert Austin watched the car stomping on television from his  office, and said that while the Volvos "didn't come out unscathed," they  appeared to hold up well compared with other cars.  </P> <P> At one point, Predator got stuck on the Volvo on its third pass over the five  cars.  </P> <P> "It was apparent that the Volvo was standing up to the full weight of the  truck. So I would leave it to the public to draw their own conclusions."  </P></p>

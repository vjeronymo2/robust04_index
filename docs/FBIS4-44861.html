			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed Y.A.: "Parallel Technologies Support </F> Expansion of Mainframe Servers"]    [Text] Thanks to its new Cisc [Complex Construction Set  Computer] processors combined with a parallel multi-server  architecture, Bull is slowly opening up its company mainframes.    "Parallel" technologies are in the process of redefining the  concepts of large and medium-sized mainframe systems. IBM  recently announced a renewal of its supply in mainframes built  on its Cisc 390 processors thanks to solutions called "parallel  transaction or interrogation servers." Mainframes are in the  process of becoming secure information servers. It is now  Bull's turn to unveil a new range of large and medium-sized  company mainframes which mark a technological break with its  previous range (DPS 7000/700 and 700/400), thanks notably to the  achievement of Symmetrical Multiprocessing Technologies (SMP)  but also thanks to the use of a "home" Cisc processor with a  very high integration density. (The processor developed in Cmos  [Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor]/VLSI [Very Large Scale  Integration] technology by Bull integrates 4.7 million  transistors. It runs at 66 MHz and offers 30 Mips [million  instructions per second] power)  <H5>  Up to 24 Parallel Processors </H5>   These servers can integrate up to 24 processors in parallel  (6 cards with 4 processors) and are defined according to a  number of models in relation to the missions they are destined  to carry out: mainframe on a transactional processing  environment (up to 7,000 active users), network server (up to  1,000 users), relational applications server, and client/server  in a production environment and as a decision-making aid. On  each of the cards interlinked by a bus with a debit of 500 Mo/s  [Megabyte per second], processors communicate with each other  with the help of an interconnection network with an output of 1  Go/s [Gigabyte per second] and sharing a memory faceplate of 64  Ko [Kilobytes] (Footnote 2) (The faceplate coherence is directly  managed by the GC0S7 mainframe operation system in which a EXMS  multiprocessor extension was jointly developed). The result is  an increase in power of over 50 percent compared to the previous  range and an improvement in the performance/price ratio which,  according to Bull, is of a factor of three. These new  capacities mean important gains in terms of transfer rates  (local network at 100 Mbits/s instead of 10 Mbits/s) in  particular under TCP/IP [Transmission Control Protocol/Internet  Protocol] for client/server applications while discharging  (thanks to the parallelism) the main servers from their  communication tasks. The cost of the Mips on the network server  is to the order of 20,000 French francs [Fr] while it used to be  about Fr180,000 on the previous range and Fr60,000 on the most  recent generations of parallel servers. The expansion to open  systems (Unix) and to client/server applications, which requires  a lot of communications to render the heterogeneous nature of  the systems transparent to the user), are not only becoming  possible but also accessible in terms of cost.</p>

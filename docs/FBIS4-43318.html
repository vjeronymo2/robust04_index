			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Industry Minister Vito Gnutti by Franco </F> Locatelli in Rome; date not given: "Gnutti: Farewell to  National Electric Power Board Monopoly" -- first paragraph is IL  SOLE-24 ORE introduction]    [Text] A policy supporting industry, new rules for the  utilities, privatization, reforms at the ministry: These are  the cornerstones of the government program for Industry Minister  Vito Gnutti, who explains them for the first time in an  interview with IL SOLE-24 ORE. But our talk can only begin with  the event of the moment: the latest eruption of the Sulcis  [Sardinian coalmine closure] issue on Tuesday [7 June].    [Locatelli] Minister, who has made you more angry? The  miners demonstrating in front of Palazzo Chigi [government seat]  for the implementation of the agreements, or Berlusconi when he  contradicted you?    [Gnutti] Neither the miners, who deserve the respect owed to  people who work, nor Berlusconi, who has concurred with the  technical criticisms that I expressed on the Sulcis deal,  regardless of the decision to honor a pact signed by the  previous government, have made me angry. However, the final  word has not yet been said. I shall be visiting the Sulcis area  in person and, as stated in the cabinet memorandum, I shall  ascertain whether or not there are alternative solutions to the  gasification plan that will make for better use of public funds  in promoting real development in the area concerned.    [Locatelli] The other surprise aspect of Tuesday's cabinet  meeting was the lack of decisionmaking regarding the automobile  industry. Why was that?    [Gnutti] The simple truth is that these measures have never  been discussed at government level, and I personally shall keep  quiet on the subject, because talking about it would only upset  the market. All I can say is that we are seeing the first signs  of recovery in the automobile market, which I find very  encouraging.    [Locatelli] You claim that the best policy to adopt on  industry at the moment is to remove the constraints rather than  to provide financing. After the initial action taken by the  government, what other measures are you thinking about?    [Gnutti] We shall do away with the pointless chores, the  bureaucratic burdens, and the confusion that pervades the  statute books so as to render the laws governing business as  simple as possible. The first step addressed taxation. The  second will address the labor market, and the third the  environment, on which I shall submit a framework bill clarifying  rights and duties.    [Locatelli] Is the removal of constraints sufficient to  foster the growth of small businesses?    [Gnutti] Of course it is not sufficient, but it is  essential.  However, an all-round policy of support for small businesses  will require a series of new financial measures ranging from the  creation of a type of NASDAQ or local stock exchanges for small-  and medium- sized enterprises to the launch of pension funds and  closed funds.    [Locatelli] And to enhance the competitiveness of the few  major corporations?    [Gnutti] The one thing that we cannot do, because in the  first place Europe forbids it, let alone our free-market  convictions, is to adopt a policy of aid and financial handouts  to sectors of industry. But this does not mean that the state  must take no action. Quite the contrary. It must foster the  development of the infrastructure and services, reform the  education and training system, safeguard the environment, and,  more generally, make the country reliable, on an international  level as well, so that companies can be a match for the best on  the market.    [Locatelli] The government promises that privatization will  be one of its battleships, but you have warned, with an eye to  the public utilities, that there must not be a leap out of the  frying pan of the state monopoly into the fire of private  monopoly. Do you mean that new rules are needed for the grid  utilities?    [Gnutti] That is exactly what I mean. We must learn from the  most advanced experience acquired in other countries, and  British experience in particular, and set out to create  authorities monitoring standards of service, to espouse the  price cap model for charges, to safeguard competition, and to  adopt the golden share system as a means of guarding against the  country's major grids being colonized.    [Locatelli] What sort of privatization does the government  have in mind for STET [Turin Telephone Finance Company]?    [Gnutti] The cabinet has not yet discussed the matter, but I  think Berlusconi will call ad hoc cabinet meetings toward the  end of the month to define the privatization strategy and to  decide on the most appropriate solution for each individual IRI  [Institute for Industrial Reconstruction] company, for ENI  [National Hydrocarbons Corporation], or ENEL [National Electric  Power Board]. However, I can say that, without making an issue  of it, wherever possible I favor the most appropriate form of  the public company model.    [Locatelli] As far ENEL is concerned, you have long  advocated separating its power generation, transmission, and  distribution functions. Can you explain your idea in greater  detail?    [Gnutti] It has to be realized that, in its current form,  the  ENEL monopoly is on the wane and that the only natural monopoly  that makes any sense is one on power transmission lines. Both  generation (as is already happening as a result of autonomous  generation) and distribution (via municipal or private  corporations) can be carried out by a variety of operators.  This in no way prevents the continued existence of a strong  body with the capacity to plan, modernize, and expand the  national electricity grid, but it must be borne in mind that, in  view of the direction in which Community policy is moving, it  may not be long before that same body is obliged to rent out its  lines, for a fair charge, to carry the power that the end  consumer has purchased from the most competitive supplier.    [Locatelli] What will the implications be for ENEL?    [Gnutti] It will mean that our major electricity corporation  will have to be restructured and that its business as a monopoly  must be kept distinct from the business that it handles within a  competitive system. It remains to be seen how the restructuring  operation, provided the whole government agrees to it, can be  coordinated with privatization.    [Locatelli] As regards IRI, on the other hand, it all looks  easier, as you consider that it is now an empty box. It would  appear that you would like a receiver appointed in place of [IRI  Chairman] Prodi. Am I right?    [Gnutti] Nothing is further from my mind than the  appointment  of a receiver for IRI; what is needed is a chairman who will  conclude the privatizations in the full light of day, without  traumatizing the companies or the markets. Anyway, I did not  invent the notion that IRI has outlived its historical purpose:  It is a fact that no one can deny.    [Locatelli] One last question: You maintain that the  Industry Ministry must cease to be a structure at the service of  the minister and become a structure at the service of the  business world. How do you mean?    [Gnutti] The idea is to computerize the entire ministry so  as  to create electronic centers throughout the country, probably on  the premises of the chambers of commerce, to act as local  ministry offices, and to speed up and clarify all the procedures  for which the ministry is currently responsible, decentralizing  the ministry's functions without depriving it of its  coordinating role at national level; on the contrary, the local  centers will keep it supplied with reliable, up-to-date  information regarding the problems faced by the various  industrial areas. As I see it, this is also what federalism is  about.</p>

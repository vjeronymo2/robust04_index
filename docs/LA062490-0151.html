			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY OVER FLAG AMENDMENT  </P> <P> Trying by law to bind the conscience of persons who think that they are above  the rule of law is as futile as enacting that the sun shall rise in the west.  Justice William Brennan and his gang, confident that they will never be called  to account, will simply violate the latest constitutional amendment as eagerly  as they defied the first in Texas vs. Johnson.  </P> <P> The solution is rather to impeach and depose of them. Replace them with honest  public servants who will obey the laws that we already have, and no tampering  with the Constitution will be necessary. Only then will a government of laws,  not of men, become a reality in this country.  </P> <P> I could not care less about the flag; I could not care more about the  perversion of the Constitution, be it by Brennan or by Bush.  </P> <P> RONALD SANBORN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

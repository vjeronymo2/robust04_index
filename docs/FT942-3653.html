			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections: Greens wilt from 14.9% to 3.2% Green party campaigners were hiding their disappointment yesterday as it became clear that the party's showing in the European election fell far short of its 1989 triumph, even though it escaped the annihilation which some predicted. Mr Chris Rose, Green party election agent, said last night at the party's headquarters in Balham, south London, that the party 'would like to have got more candidates over the 5 per cent mark'. But he added: 'It's democracy, so we can't complain.' The Greens polled 3.2 per cent of the vote compared with the 14.9 per cent they achieved in 1989. The result is an improvement on the party's 1.3 per cent in the 1992 general election, but worse than the 5 per cent it managed in the local elections last month. The 1989 success was largely due to the prominence of green issues following the 1986 Chernobyl explosion and the death of North Sea seals. Since 1989 the recession has pushed their concerns down the political agenda - with issues such as unemployment and health more prominent. Green party candidates believe that the lack of a proportional representation system has discouraged many who voted Green last time. Mr Rose said: 'People like to vote for a party they think will win.' The party fielded 84 candidates, covering all but three of the seats. Only three candidates broke through the 5 per cent barrier and kept their deposits. Ms Jean Lambert, the party chair, achieved the best result with 6.4 per cent of the vote in London North East. The party won 5.6 per cent in Herefordshire and Shropshire, and 5 per cent in Sussex South and Crawley. According to party organisers the loss of Pounds 81,000 in deposits in other constituencies will not rattle the cash-strapped central administration. Mr Rose said: 'The money was raised locally and lost locally, and we regard it as spent well in promoting our case.' The decline in green fortunes was repeated, although less dramatically, across Europe. Greens won 23 seats in the new European parliament, compared with 27 in the assembly just ended, and 30 in the 1989 assembly.</p>

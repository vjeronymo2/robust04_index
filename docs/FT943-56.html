			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - Finance and Investment (14): The art of staying ahead is adaptation - Competitiveness / Frances Williams takes a quizzical look at the IMD report 'Damned if you do and damned if you don't' just about sums up the gloomy message for the industrialised world of this year's World Competitiveness Report issued by the Swiss-based International Institute for Management Development (IMD) and the World Economic Forum. Its theme is that countries as well as companies must accept the need for constant change and adaptation to stay ahead of rivals in world markets, in a never-ending quest for global competitiveness. Many of those changes are going to be painful, especially for European nations which are finding it increasingly difficult to support high living standards and social benefits. Prof Stephane Garelli, head of the World Competitiveness Project at IMD, believes the west is in a bind. If a country loses competitiveness, it will not be able to afford an affluent lifestyle. But to compete effectively, it may have to jettison that lifestyle anyway. Little wonder that a strong body of opinion in industrialised countries holds that 'competitiveness is unfair'. Prof Garelli's own view is that 'competitiveness is not unfair but it is rough'. It is also inescapable; markets worldwide are being blasted open by a series of legislative, technological and management revolutions, most notably the Uruguay Round global trade agreements, developments in communications and data transmission, and the spread of multinationals. One consequence of the race for competitiveness will be a shift of jobs to the third world, Prof Garelli says. 'The opening of world markets and the harmonisation of international business rules, through agreements such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), puts enormous pressure on business activities to relocate.' In the past 10 years, a labour force of some 1,200m people has become reachable in the developing countries, at an average cost of less than Dollars 2 an hour. The industrialised nations at present employ 350m people paid an average hourly wage of Dollars 18. 'European labour costs are four times as high as in East Asia but European workers are not four times as productive,' says Prof Garelli, pointing out that freer trade and technological advances now permit companies to farm out discrete bits of the production process to wherever seems most profitable. 'Today, an outflow of manufacturing operations from western economies seems inevitable.' Even more gloomily, Prof Garelli predicts a similar exodus of white-collar jobs. There are already some straws in the wind. Swissair, Switzerland's national airline, has transferred much of its accounts work to Bombay. American banks use Ireland for processing financial data. India and the Philippines have flourishing software industries. Unemployment in industrialised countries will thus remain high, Prof Garelli says. Moreover, he believes that the incomes of a good part of the workforce may fall. Over the past decade or so, European pay levels have risen at the expense of jobs, while the US has created jobs at the cost of falling real wages. But both paths have led to stagnation or even declines in the purchasing power of lower-income households. Prof Garelli sees this trend extending to the middle classes, as Europe follows the US in greater wage flexibility and governments in both the US and Europe are forced to raise taxes to reduce ballooning budget deficits. If so, 'we shall soon see the first generation since the war to have the doubtful privilege of becoming poorer than their parents'. Prof Garelli admits that some parts of the west's 'value system' actually contribute to competitiveness - high education standards, for instance, or a corporate culture that reinforces employee commitment to the company. Indeed, the US - which regained top place in the competitiveness league table this year after an eight-year reign by Japan - is warned that poor secondary education and 'work attitudes' could if left untackled lead to long-term decline. But, he argues, the industrialised countries and especially Europe have a value system that costs them more than their present levels of competitiveness can support. As a result, most governments are running unsustainably high budget deficits. Fortunately, there are some indications that Prof Garelli's scenario may be too pessimistic. The World Competitiveness Report itself places 16 OECD members among the top 20 competitive nations. Germany and Switzerland, with the highest labour costs in the world, come fifth and sixth. This is because, as the report recognises, competitiveness is a complex thing which does not depend simply on relative labour costs. 'Soft' factors such as a skilled labour force, high quality communications and transport infrastructure, government policies, research capabilities and so on all count for more and more as countries move up the development ladder. An analysis of the impact of multinationals on world employment by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) seems to bear this out. Its recent World Investment Report argued that, while multinationals were ever more active, relatively few jobs are switched from the West to developing countries. Most overseas investment, it says, is designed to exploit natural resources and new markets rather than labour-cost differentials (though there are important exceptions such as electronics). In this context, companies are increasingly placing emphasis on an educated, committed workforce and good infrastructure. The World Competitiveness Report also defines competitiveness in a way designed to produce winners and losers: 'World competi-tiveness is the ability of a country or a company to, proportionally, generate more wealth than its competitors in world markets.' If some countries move up the table, others must move down. The OECD, by contrast, defines competitiveness in a way that allows everyone to win: 'Competitiveness is the degree to which a country can, under free and fair market conditions, produce goods and services which meet the test of international markets, while simultaneously maintaining and expanding the real incomes of its people over the long term.' Post-war experience suggests the OECD's definition may be nearer the mark. Japan and the newly industrialising countries of East Asia have emerged as world-class competitors at the same time as the west has grown richer. The 125 nations that participated in the Uruguay Round of global trade talks certainly did so in the belief that expanding markets worldwide provide opportunities for all.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- COMPETITIVENESS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- World standing 1994  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  1 US                        22 Chile  2 Singapore                 23 Thailand  3 Japan                     24 Korea  4 Hong Kong                 25 Spain  5 Germany                   26 Mexico  6 Switzerland               27 Argentina  7 Denmark                   28 Portugal  8 Netherlands               29 Turkey  9 New Zealand               30 Colombia 10 Sweden                    31 Indonesia 11 Norway                    32 Italy 12 Austria                   33 Philippines 13 France                    34 India 14 UK                        35 South Africa 15 Australia                 36 Czech Republic 16 Canada                    37 Greece 17 Malaysia                  38 Brazil 18 Taiwan                    39 Hungary 19 Ireland                   40 Venezuela 20 Finland                   41 Poland 21 Belgium/Luxembourg  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: World Competitiveness Report, International Institute for Management Development  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

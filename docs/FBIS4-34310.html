			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares by </F> Carlos Banales Marino, EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO correspondent in  Washington, D.C.; date not given]    [Text] [Banales Marino] What are the differences between  the OAS you encountered 10 years ago and the OAS you are leaving  now?    [Baena Soares] I am very pleased with the fact that I was  able to be present at the OAS during a period of reaffirmation  and modernization of our organization. I am leaving an  organization that is prominent; able to meet new challenges; has  been strengthened by member countries' political will; is able  to react to attacks on democratic processes; and is prepared to  cope with serious problems involving trade, environment, illegal  drug abuse, and all those issues currently worrying the modern  world. All the governments represented at the OAS have been  elected in free elections and this represents a huge difference  from the situation 10 years ago.    [Banales Marino] Are we entitled to say that the OAS has  matured as an international organization throughout these 10  years?    [Baena Soares] I believe it has improved. This organization  was established in 1889. Afterward, our countries met  periodically until the OAS Charter was voted on in 1948. And  this may be the date when the OAS was formally established. It  is not possible to say that an organization established more  than 100 years ago is not mature. I would prefer to say that  this was a period of reaffirmation of our organization as a  mechanism for dialogue among countries in our hemisphere.    [Banales Marino] At this moment and with the current OAS  structure, do you believe the OAS has more mechanisms available  to improve Latin America's political and social perspectives?    [Baena Soares] No doubt. I believe these mechanisms involve  the three reforms of the OAS Charter and the approval of such a  new idea as integral development.    [Banales Marino] During your tenure as OAS secretary general  there were a number of crises in Latin America in which the OAS  became strongly involved. In your opinion, which one was the  most delicate?    [Baena Soares] I believe the entire peace process in Central  America represented a very significant participation effort by  our organization. We are involved in various stages of a process  in Nicaragua, Honduras, and Costa Rica. Understandably, this is  absolutely necessary from a humanitarian viewpoint--in the first  place--and considering a country's economic interests, job  openings, and the use of land.    When democracy was under attack, we created a favorable  atmosphere with our participation, but I am aware of the fact  that the decisions to restore democracy are made by the people.  It is not the OAS but the people who guarantee democracy. The  inter-American community, through the OAS, may actually  cooperate, assist, and create a favorable atmosphere. In Haiti,  we still have problems. I am used to saying that the mere fact  that there still are problems is something essential because, if  you look back, 15 years ago there were people like Duvalier and  Generals Nanfir and Avril. There was a different reaction, one  of approval. Now there is one of rejection. Not a single  American country has recognized the de facto authorities in  three years. Moreover, there has always been an adverse  reaction, seeking a solution. What are the roots, the profound  reasons for this crisis?    The links between entrepreneurs and the military are at the  root of the crisis because the entrepreneurs never accepted the  elections, never accepted the presence of President Aristide.  And as long as we do not tackle the cause of an illness, it  cannot be cured.    [Banales Marino] Do you believe the embargo on Haiti, the  way  it is currently being implemented, represents a final solution?    [Baena Soares] As long as some entrepreneurs are allowed to  travel abroad, do business, and carry out transactions with  their foreign accounts, we will be doing something that does not  directly affect the people responsible. Therefore, I am saying  that not all our organization's and its member countries'  resources have been exhausted. Attempts already have been made  to achieve an agreement. We already have four agreements signed.  These agreements have not been respected at either the OAS or  the United Nations. Therefore, solutions may not be invented. In  my opinion, a military intervention does not represent a  solution. We must not forget that in the past Haiti was occupied  for 19 years. Duvalier's period, and not democracy, followed  this occupation. The consequences of the Duvalier period still  can be seen.    [Banales Marino] What about Cuba?    [Baena Soares] Cuba is a country that belongs to this  hemisphere. The OAS is this hemisphere's international  organization that may not ignore any situation prevailing in  this hemisphere. We currently are experiencing many changes in  the international system. There are transformations that must be  taken into account. All this represents a clue for discussion of  this issue. I cannot anticipate the stances to be taken by the  governments, but I can actually point out that it is necessary  to hold this discussion. This issue has not been included on the  OAS General Assembly's agenda but it obviously is present.</p>

			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Angolan government offers peace talks to Unita rebels THE Angolan government has offered to hold immediate peace talks to end a resumed civil war against the Unita rebel movement after suffering a series of military reverses, Reuter reports from Luanda. It remains unclear however whether the rebels will attend. Diplomats said Unita had taken an oil platform offshore from Soyo but would free 17 foreigners held since the guerrillas captured the town, Angola's second most important oil centre, on Tuesday. State radio said the government put forward a five-point proposal for talks to be held today in Addis Adaba, giving into Unita demands for political as well as military matters to be discussed at the meeting first proposed two weeks ago. The proposal called on Unita to respect May 1991 peace accords, honour an immediate ceasefire, accept the results of September elections, allow the free circulation of people and goods and respect the UN role in the country. But Unita, which scuppered earlier negotiations by setting last-minute conditions, said it was not given enough time to prepare for the talks, which the government said should be organised by the United Nations. 'Unita welcomes the talks that will begin soon in the Ethiopian capital under the auspices of the United Nations,' '' Unita's Washington office said. 'Unfortunately, the fierce fighting in Huambo and the government's massive indiscriminate aerial bombardments makes it impossible to assemble our delegations and arrange transport as quickly as we would like.' Unita and the government signed an accord in 1991 ending 16 years of civil war in the southern African country which gained independence from Portugal in 1975. But fighting resumed in earnest this month after Unita rejected the results of September elections and took control of 70 per cent of the country. Diplomats said the government was apparently on the defensive after the loss of Soyo and its inability to take Huambo, Unita's headquarters in the central highlands, in two weeks of heavy air and artillery raids.</p>

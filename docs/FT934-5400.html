			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Japan The downward slide of the Nikkei average should not send a shudder through the world's financial markets just yet. While previous bouts of weakness have tempered the enthusiasm of Japanese investors for foreign stocks and bonds, the overall pattern of buying has remained intact. True, Japan recorded a rare long-term capital account surplus in 1991 after the bubble economy burst. But a sharp decline in direct investment abroad by Japanese companies - and heavy buying of Tokyo equities by US and European institutions - were to blame. Japanese portfolio investors remained net buyers of overseas assets even as the Nikkei fell below 15,000 last year. With four months to go before their financial year-end, Japanese institutions have little immediate need to take overseas profits to cover book losses at home. Low interest rates have anyway diminished the attractions of yen bonds or deposits. The recent weakness of the yen is an additional incentive to hold foreign currency assets. The exchange rate might also serve as evidence that Japanese investors are not preparing to take capital home. Even though the currency market remains preoccupied with other factors - notably the grim economic outlook in Japan - widespread portfolio selling might be expected to nudge the yen higher. Still, experience suggests that a tumbling domestic equity market and economic uncertainty at home will cause bullish Japanese investors to pull in their horns. European bond markets which have thrived on Japanese interest so far this year may have to learn to live without.</p>

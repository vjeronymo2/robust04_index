			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 25 May -- During today's meeting between the  Sejm Commission for Liaison with Poles Abroad and the Senate  Commission for Immigration and Poles Abroad, Leszek Wasiuta, the  head of the satellite channel of Polish Television SA [TVP SA--  TVPolonia], said his channel was under threat because its status  was not legalized in the broadcasting law.    That is why, in his opinion, TVP SA is not expected to be  interested in investing TVP SA profits in TVPolonia as at  present. He says the fact that TVPolonia was set up under Janusz  Zaorski, the former head of the state radio and television, who  was in conflict with the National Radio and Television  Broadcasting Council [KRRiT], may affect this.    Danuta Celinska, TVP SA head of programming, has given  assurances that the board had no intention of closing down  TVPolonia; on the contrary "it is at the heart of our deepest  and greatest interests." Also, KRRiT Head Ryszard Bender said  that the council was not interested in closing down TVPolonia.</p>

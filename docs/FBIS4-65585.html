			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, May 18 (A.A.) -- Foreign Ministry spokesman  Ferhat Ataman said today that Russia shared Turkey's concerns  over the Iraq-Turkish pipeline and has expressed that it will  support Ankara on the issue.    Ataman told his weekly press conference that during his  contacts in Moscow last week, Ambassador Bilgin Unan conveyed  Turkey's views on the oil pipeline, which has been shut since  the Gulf war.    During his contacts, Unan told Russian officials that Turkey  awaited Russia's understanding and support, in relation to  measures foreseen to `save the pipeline', Ataman said.    Russian officials said that they shared Turkey's concerns  and  were supporting Turkey in this matter.    Turkey wants to drain the oil remaining in the pipeline  since  the U.N. imposed sanctions on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait  and to repair the pipeline which is presently rotting away.</p>

			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> BEST BETS: PHOTOS RECAPTURE 'GRAPES OF WRATH'  </P> <P> Horace Bristol's photographs of poor itinerant farmers during the California  Dust Bowl years are as poignant as "The Grapes of Wrath," the John Steinbeck  novel inspired by the same scenes Bristol recorded on film.  </P> <P> They can be seen with other Bristol photos at the Ojai Arts Center Gallery,  where black and white works of the 82-year-old Ojai resident are on display  through the end of this month.  </P> <P> Bristol's photo essays include ones taken during World War II in Japan, Korea  and North Africa.  </P> <P> But some of his most important work was shot here in California, capturing the  plight of the people who lost everything during the Depression.  </P> <P> Bristol traveled through Northern California with author John Steinbeck and  made a photo record of families fighting for survival during the dust bowl  days.  </P> <P> The story is a fictionalized account of "the actual people that we came in  contact with," Bristol said. "Steinbeck grew fond of my prints and he wrote  about the real people in them."  </P> <P> " 'The Grapes of Wrath' is something that every generation must be reminded  of," he said, "and I hope this helps."  </P> <P> The gallery is located at 113 S. Montgomery St., Ojai. For information, call  646-0117.  </P></p>

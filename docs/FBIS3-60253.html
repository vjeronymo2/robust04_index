			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jakarta, Dec. 10 (BERNAMA) -- Malaysia and  Indonesia have agreed to intensify cooperation in forestry  research and exchange programme of forest experts in efforts to  counter anti-tropical woods campaigns by developed countries.  Forestry Minister Jamaludin Suryohadikusumo said the  cooperation would focus mainly on research and studies of  tropical forests such as rattan, bamboos, and rubber. Malaysia  and Indonesia view the cooperation very important because they  share common problems in dealing with anti- tropical wood  campaigns by advanced countries, he said in Surabaya, East Java  last night. Jamaludin and his Malaysian counterpart, Datuk Sri  Dr. Lim Keng Yaik, attended a dinner hosted by East Java  Governor Basofi Sudirman in conjunction with the annual meeting  of 38 forest experts from the two countries which is due to last  [to] tomorrow. Jamaludin said both sides would intensify  information exchange on tropical forest development and  management system in efforts to confront anti-tropical wood  campaigns sponsored by industrialised countries. We share a  common political will with Malaysia to counter those who accuse  developing nations of uncontrolled exploitation of tropical  woods, he said. Such accusations are unfounded, he said, adding  that Indonesia has always maintained a strict policy on forest  preservation. Jamaludin said Indonesia with a large area of  tropical forests would be playing a key role among ASEAN  countries to counter such campaigns. The four-day meeting in  Surabaya is the sixth such annual gathering among experts of the  two countries.</p>

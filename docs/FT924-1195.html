			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Pensions may limit Post Office plans RULES governing the Post Office pension fund may play a key role in determining the timing of the government's plans for the organisation. The rules limit the circumstances under which an estimated Pounds 80m surplus in Parcelforce's pension fund may be transferred to a new owner. The government may need to signal a clear intention to break up the Post Office before selling its parcel delivery arm if it wants to be able to transfer the surplus. The surplus could act as a significant sweetener for prospective purchasers, enhancing the attractiveness of the loss-making business. According to actuarial advice in the Post Office's possession, the proportion of Post Office pension scheme funds relating to Parcelforce employees is 'most likely' to be assessed on a 'past service reserve basis' in the event of the unit's sale and the absence of any special factors. This means that enough funds would be transferred to finance members' accrued pension rights but not to reflect any surplus resources. There is a Pounds 1.4bn surplus in the main Post Office pension fund, suggesting the proportion relating to Parcelforce could amount to Pounds 80m or more. The government - which is reviewing pension regulations through its Pensions Law Review Committee - announced in July that it intended to sell Parcelforce. It is expected to announce the outcome of its review of the Post Office's structure early next year. According to the actuarial advice, 'special factors' might be deemed to apply if this review resulted in the Post Office 'being split up into various discreet segments'. It adds: 'In these circumstances the trustees might well conclude that the part of the fund attributed to each tranche of membership should include an appropriate share of the surplus in the schemes.' In an implicit reference to the possible use of the fund as a sweetener, trustees are also advised to consider 'any provisions that there are or will be in the purchaser's scheme for the possible repayment of any surplus resources to the purchaser'. Kleinwort Benson, the government's adviser on the future of the service, has told ministers that the Royal Mail, the Post Office's letters division, is a 'classic candidate' for a flotation. The less profitable Post Office Counters, which handles social security payments, would be harder to sell separately. Kleinwort Benson believes the division is fundamentally uncommer-cial. The Post Office said discussions on how to handle the pension fund issue had not yet started.</p>

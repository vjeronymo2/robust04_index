			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Bank moves to ease money market difficulties The Bank of England is proposing to broaden the scope of its money market operations to help overcome the liquidity problems which have dogged the City since Black Wednesday. The proposed changes, involving the sale and repurchase of UK government bonds, should reduce the volatility of short-term interest rates. Overnight rates have ranged from about 4.5 per cent to well over 10 per cent, according to the Bank. The new arrangements could pave the way for an 'open repo' system for gilts, enabling investors to lend their holdings in the same way that holders of US Treasury, French and German government debt can do. The Bank plans to introduce the new arrangements in early 1994. Following the crisis in September 1992 when the Bank had to intervene heavily to support sterling, the money market has suffered from a lack of liquidity. The Bank was forced to introduce temporary facilities to provide liquidity to the banking system, allowing the ad hoc sale and repurchase of gilts. 'The scale of the Bank's money market operations has remained large and it seems likely that facilities of the kind provided since September 1992 will continue to be needed for the foreseeable future. The Bank proposes therefore to make them a systematic component of its money market operations,' says the central bank in its document. The Bank has decided to make these repo facilities available on a regular fortnightly timetable, with funds provided through the purchase and resale of UK government debt denominated in sterling or other currencies. It also proposes to widen the range of participants to allow all banks, building societies and gilt-edged marketmakers (Gemms) to act as counterparties. Previously, only the top banks and building societies, as well as the Gemms, were allowed to do so. 'This move will dramatically reduce the volatility of the overnight interest rates,' said a money market specialist at a big clearing bank. Banks should have a much clearer idea of their short-term funding costs as a result.</p>

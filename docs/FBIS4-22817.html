Poroshkov, V.S. Gurin, and N.I. Kuntsevich, </F> Physicochemical Problems Scientific Research Institute, Byelarus  University, Minsk; UDC 541.138.3]    [Abstract] TiO[.sub]2[/] films were produced on a  metallic titanium surface by hydrolysis of a solution of  polybutyltitanate in air. The resultant amorphous films were  heated at a temperature of 450 to 500C for 1 hour. This  resulted in the formation of an anatase modification of a  polycrystalline TiO[.sub]2[/] film (i.e.,  Ti-TiO[.sub]2[/]). Next the electrochemical deposition of Cu,  Pd, and Ag onto the surface of Ti-TiO[.sub]2[/] electrodes  was studied. The deposition was performed from a solution  containing nitrates of the respective metals with a  concentration of 10[.sup]-5[/] to 10[.sup]-3[/] M. In some  of the experiments, the deposition was conducted under  continuous ultraviolet irradiation in an electrochemical cell.  Preliminary electrochemical deposition of the metal particles  onto the surface of the Ti-TiO[.sub]2[/] electrodes was  accomplished by cathode deposition of a calculated amount of  metal in a galvanostatic mode. Some of the electrodes were  modified by adsorption of Pd[.sup]2+[/] ions from a 0.005 M  PdCl[.sub]2[/] solution for 10 to 1,000 seconds under  closed-circuit conditions. The electrochemical experiment was  conducted in a conventional electrochemical cell with a P-5827M  potentiostat. Saturated Ag chloride served as the normal  electrode, and a platinum electrode served as the auxiliary  electrode. The experiments established that the deposition of  each of the aforementioned metals on TiO[.sub]2[/] electrodes  occurred with a higher cathode overvoltage than on metallic  electrodes in the respective solutions. Preliminary  electrochemical deposition of Ag particles onto the electrodes  at a surface concentration of 10[.sup]14[/]  atoms/cm[.sup]2[/] or less resulted in a decrease in the Ag  deposition overvoltage by more than 0.1 V. Modification of the  electrode surface by Cu particles in amounts up to  10[.sup]15[/] to 10[.sup]16[/] atoms/cm[.sup]2[/]  resulted in only a slight shift of the cathode arm of the  potentiodynamic curve to the negative side. Nor did preliminary  electrochemical modification by Pd particles with a  concentration of 10[.sup]15[/] atoms/cm[.sup]2[/] have any  significant effect on the position of the cathode arm when it  was Pd that was being electrochemically deposited. Only when the  amount of Pd deposited in advance was increased to  10[.sup]16[/] atoms/cm[.sup]2[/] did the deposition  potential shift by 0.05-0.1 V. Preliminary modification of the  electrode surface by Ag in the amount of 10[.sup]16[/]  atoms/cm[.sup]2[/] resulted in a shift in the cathode arm of  the potentiodynamic curve to the positive side, i.e., it  resulted in a decrease in the cathode overvoltage of the metal's  deposition as compared with that in the case of an unmodified  electrode. Irradiation of the TiO[.sub]2[/] electrodes with  ultraviolet radiation during the electrochemical process did  alter the potential of the deposition of Cu or Pd. In the case  of Ag, however, irradiation caused an decrease in the  overvoltage of the metal's deposition by more than 0.1 V and a  significant increase in process rate. When Ti-TiO[.sub]2[/]  electrodes in contact with a 0.005 M AgNO[.sub]3[/] solution  were subjected to ultraviolet irradiation (H = 0.1  J/cm[.sup]2[/]), photolytic silver particles ranging in size  from 5 to 50 nm formed in a concentration of 10[.sup]8[/] to  10[.sup]9[/] cm[.sup]-2[/] (with a predominance of  particles measuring 5-10 nm in size). As the electrodes'  exposure increased (H = 1 J/cm[.sup]2[/]), the concentration  increased (to 10[.sup]10[/] cm[.sup]-2[/]) with virtually  no change in the particles' size distribution. Only at much  higher exposures (to 10 J/cm[.sup]2[/]) did larger particles  (50-100 nm) appear and smaller particles (5-10 nm) disappear.  Cathode polarization of the Ti-TiO[.sub]2[/] electrode  coupled with simultaneous ultraviolet irradiation resulted in  particles that were an order of magnitude larger than those  formed when the deposition process was conducted with no  irradiation. The significant differences observed for the  selectivity of the deposition of Cu, Ag, and Pd was attributed  to the fact that the energy levels of the metal particles  created did not in all cases correspond with the position of the  Fermi level of TiO[.sub]2[/]. Kinetic factors involved in the  growth of the particles of the metal phase were also implicated.  Figures 3; references 4 (Russian).</p>

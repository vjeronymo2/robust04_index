			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] The dispute arising from the decision of  the U.S. House of Representatives to attach conditions to and  cut the aid to Turkey is continuing. Ankara considers the  decision unacceptable, and the view that we should reject all  the aid is gaining ground.    The lack of lobbying activity by Turkey also had its effect  on the decision of the House of Representatives.    [Unidentified reporter] Yesterday the House of  Representatives decided to put conditions on the aid requested  for Turkey by the Administration and cut it by 25 percent. The  southeastern problem and Cyprus were put forward as conditions.    The decision of the House of Representatives will also be  discussed in the U.S. Senate. If the Senate also approves the  decision, then the whole thing will depend on the signature of  U.S. President Clinton.    There was a reaction in Ankara against the decision of the  House of Representatives. Rejection of all the aid is gaining  ground within the True Path Party-Social Democrat Populist Party  coalition.    Lack of lobbying by Turkey in the U.S. Congress also played  a  role in the decision of the House of Representatives. Prime  Minister Tansu Ciller cancelled the agreements with firms  engaged in lobbying for Turkey. At present, there is no firm in  the U.S. lobbying for Turkey.</p>

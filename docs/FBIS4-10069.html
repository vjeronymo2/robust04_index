			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Marcelo Helfgot: "UCR Plans for `The Day </F> After'"]    [Text] Half of the Radicals have begun to rehearse the role  they will play following the 10 April elections. They see  themselves as survivors of "The Day After," title of a film  showing what the Earth would look like after a nuclear war.    Albeit less dramatically, the other half admit that the  party  centennial will not be able to avoid a "big bang," exploding  into a myriad of group and personal agendas revolving in  different orbits.    They must all go through a narrow pass that seems to be  leading the UCR [Radical Civic Union] to the most serious crisis  in its history. Raul Alfonsin and his loyal supporters are  clinging as if to a life raft to the remote possibility of  winning 30 percent of the Constituent Convention votes. Those  rejecting the Olives Pact are betting on a major blunder by the  former president so as to be able to pass the bill on to him and  steer the party in a different direction.    A handful of figures hopes not to get caught in the  crossfire. The governors of Cordoba and Rio Negro, Eduardo  Angeloz and Horacio Massaccesi, are confident they will emerge  from the election challenge even stronger and that their  presence will be essential in putting the UCR back together.  Deputy Rodolfo Terragno, who runs no risk in this confrontation,  will come out seeking to spread his image throughout the country  via the Future line, which he will launch in Rosario on 14 April.    The Radicals' election campaign navigates on troubled waters  with Alfonsin at the helm, having endured the revolts instigated  by Fernando de la Rua in the capital and Sergio Montiel in Entre  Rios. Before coming into port, it ran up against the challenge  posed by the Convergence, headed by Federico Storrani and Juan  Manuel Casella, who announced plans for an offensive on the  party leadership beginning the next day.    Underground movements led by former Alfonsinist successors  and joined by allies from other districts (such as Victor Fayad)  surfaced in the midst of rumors attributing a divisionist  attitude to them. All fingers pointed to another subscriber to  the plan, Osvaldo Alvarez Guerrero, who hastened to say he was  not betting on any breakup of the UCR, although he did not rule  out any such outcome as the result of the wrangling.    "Historic splits have been the result of pacts," the  president of the Radical convention said, pointing to the  Roca-Mitre accord in 1890 that split the Civic Union and gave  birth to radicalism, and the Frondizi-Peron agreement of 1957  from which the UCRI [Intransigent Radical Civic Union] emerged.    The protagonists in the Radical tragicomedy realize that a  very complicated libretto awaits them in the months ahead.    They will be engulfed in internal turmoil aimed at carving  out spheres of partisan power, while society has its sights set  elsewhere: on changes in the constitution and how to prolong  stability.    They will have to employ their best strategy in order to  define the environmental relationship with the government and  the much delayed formulation of an alternative proposal for the  test of fire awaiting them in '95.    If they breeze through these phases, the most complex part  of  all lies ahead: regaining their "confidence factor," which  seemed to be the heritage of the UCR and which was gradually  diluted by successive failures in power and the opposition.    What weapons are the various groups readying to meet these  challenges?    The former president plans to leap over any election  contingency and intends to become the rallying point for a front  of opposition to the Menemist model, although he will  simultaneously defend the pact with the PJ as the leader of the  bloc of Radical convention delegates.    Storani et al hope to create a generational bloc, viewing  themselves as the heirs of a bankrupt Alfonsinism.    De la Rua has opted to lower his profile, but those closest  to him have already begun to pave the way for an all-out return  and want to revive the antipact alliance, combining Montiel's  thinkers, Luis Leon, Horacio Usandizaga, and Mario Losada. Ever  since his return from Washington, Storani has tried to free  himself from this cast, but Caselli's supporters and other  allies refuse to let go.    Massaccesi will try to cement his identity by virtue of  special effects. By combining phrases from Yrigoyen with  frivolous touches and offbeat alliances--no matter that General  Roberto Requeijo's candidacy collapsed--he dreams of giving a  Copernican twist to the starchy style of the UCR.    If the police incidents connected with his administration  and  Ramon Mestre's candidacy give him the anticipated victory,  Angeloz can become the arbiter of Radicalism. Few would dispute  his presidential candidacy if the governor of Cordoba were to  decide once again to challenge Menem.    The Alfonists continue to whisper into his ear that this  time  he can beat Menem through the "ballotting" and that it is his  historic mission to unify the party. Angeloz is not convinced,  however. "I am not ready to announce," is his continuing refrain.  <H5>  [Box, p 8] </H5> <H5>  Front Opposing the "Judicialist Pact" </H5>   Carlos "Chacho" Alvarez and Raul Zaffaroni, Constituent  Convention candidates for the Grand Front and the Federal  Capital, have criticized the legal reform proposed by the  Radicals, maintaining that it contains "no obstacle preventing  partisanship in justice."    The Grand Front candidates have maintained that as a result  of Radical Deputy Leopoldo Moreau's proposal that the  Constituent Assembly declare all the judges commissioned, "the  party supporting reelection would end up destroying any  possibility of ensuring independent justice."    "It was no accident that (the Radical proposal) was  enthusiastically accepted by (Buenos Aires) Governor Eduardo  Duhalde, who added the idea that the Supreme Court should be  responsible for reorganizing the Judicial Branch," Alvarez and  Zaffaroni said.    The stakes for each after 10 April:     -  1. Raul Alfonsin: Continuing to lead the party,  implementing the Olives Pact, and calling for a social front to  oppose the Menemist model.    -  2. Fernando de la Rua and Sergio  Montiel: Requiring that Alfonsin be accountable and rebuilding  the anti-Pact alliance in order to displace it. De la Rua would  get back in the presidential race.    -  3. Eduardo Angeloz: He will  go through the "he-loves-me-he-loves-me-not" routine in order to  decide whether to accept the candidacy for '95 that will be  offered to him by the Alfonsinists and other groups.    -  4. Federico  Storani and Juan Manuel Casella: They will ask to move up the  internal elections and will launch the Convergence as a national  line in order to form a progressive, post-Alfonsinist line.    -  5.  Horacio Massaccesi and Rodolfo Terragno: They plan to go it  alone and project their respective images nationally, without  help from other quarters.</p>

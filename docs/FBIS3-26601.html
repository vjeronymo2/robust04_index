The NATO's ultimatum late Wednesday gave the Bosinan Serbs  10  days beginning 24:00 GMT Thursday to remove their heavy guns  deployed around Sarajevo, saying if they fail to comply with the  deadline, their heavy weapons will "be subjected to NATO air  strikes."    In a statement, the NATO also called upon the Government of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, within the same period, to place the heavy  weapons in its possession within the Sarajevo exclusion zone  under the control of U.N. protection forces, and to refrain from  attacks launched from within the current confrontation lines in  the city.    The statement said the Bosnian Serbs bear the main  responsibility for the tragic loss of civilian life that results  from their siege of Sarajevo.    The ultimatum was given after a mortar shelling on a market  in Sarajevo killed 68 people and wounded nearly 200 others last  Saturday. The carnage led to renewed calls for NATO air strikes  against Bosinan Serb artillery positions around Sarajevo.    NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner immediately informed  U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali of the decision made  at a meeting of the NATO ambassadors.    Despite Serb denials of responsibility for the attack on the  market, Woerner told reporters earlier: "It's time for action.  We have had enough of words."    Following the NATO ultimatum, Woerner said there would be a  swift allied response if the threat of air strikes against Serbs  brought retaliation against U.N. forces and other personnel in  Bosnia.    "If there would be an attack on U.N. personnel, then we  would  respond firmly, rapidly and ... decisively. We will do  everything possible," Woerner told a news conference after the  NATO meeting.    President Bill Clinton of the United States, which is an  important NATO member, warned Bosinan Serbs on Wednesday that  the ultimatum for the removal of Serb artillery within 21  kilometers of Sarajevo was no idle threat.    "NATO is now set to act, " he said.    The United States would participate if NATO launched air  strikes, he said at a White House news conference, but he  assured the American public that the United States would not be  drawn into any major combat role in ex-Yugoslavia.    Casting the Bosnian conflict mainly as a European issue,  Clinton said American involvement would be "proportionate to our  interests - no more, no less."    "We have made it quite clear that this will not involve  American ground forces," he added.    Under the threat of Western air strikes, Bosinan Serbs on  Wednesday agreed to a Sarajevo truce under the mediation of  U.N.representatives and pledged to pull back their artillery  from around Sarajevo and put the heavy guns under U.N.  monitoring.    Meanwhile, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic warned  against any air raids, saying, "We will shoot down every plane  we can" if attacked.    "In case of an attack, we cannot guarantee safety to any  foreigner who finds himself on our territory, " he said.    In its statement, the NATO also stressed its commitment to  securing a negotiated settlement of the Bosnian crisis, saying  the lifting of the siege of Sarajevo could be a step toward the  placing of Sarajevo under U.N. administration.</p>

			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLEMSON SURPRISES BOTH ITS COACH AND FLORIDA STATE, 34-23  </P> <P> Clemson Coach Danny Ford didn't like his chances coming into Saturday night's  game at Florida State. But his team surprised him.  </P> <P> "We had to have some people play better than they're able and to have some  others whip some people, and we did a pretty good job of accomplishing that,"  Ford said after the 10th-ranked Tigers defeated Florida State, 34-23.  </P> <P> Terry Allen scored three touchdowns in the first half, including a 73-yard  scoring run, that sparked the Tigers to a 28-10 halftime lead.  </P> <P> "Clemson's better than I thought they were," Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden  said. "That was just a good whipping."  </P> <P> Freshman linebacker Wayne Simmons also scored on a 73-yard run after  intercepting a Peter Tom Willis pass that helped Clemson take a 21-0 lead early  in the second quarter.  </P> <P> Allen, who sat out Clemson's opener for disciplinary reasons, scored Clemson's  first two touchdowns on one-yard runs. He finished with 130 yards in 20  carries.  </P> <P> Although the Tigers (2-0) led only 7-0 after one quarter, they dominated  Florida State through the early going, racking up 148 yards offense before the  Seminoles got their initial first down.  </P> <P> Florida State (0-2) closed within 21-7 when Dexter Carter scored on a two-yard  run with 1:34 left in the first half, but Allen answered with his 73-yard run  to give the Tigers a 28-7 lead.  </P> <P> Bill Mason kicked a 28-yard field goal on the final play of the half to pull  Florida State within 28-10.  </P> <P> The Seminoles drove 77 yards on the opening kickoff of the second half to cut  their deficit to 28-16 on Paul Moore's one-yard run. Willis, who passed for 242  yards, was sacked looking for a receiver on the two-point conversion attempt.  </P> <P> Florida State threatened again on its next offensive series, but Moore fumbled  at the Clemson 17 after a 20-yard run.  </P> <P> "Getting the fumble sure helped out," Ford said. "They are a tremendous  offensive football team, and they kept me scared to death the entire game."  </P> <P> Clemson's Chris Gardocki added field goals of 29 and 26 yards in the fourth  quarter.  </P> <P> Florida State's final touchdown came with five seconds left when reserve  quarterback Casey Weldon threw a 13-yard scoring pass to Chris Parker.  </P> <P> Florida State totaled 378 yards offense and 25 first downs.  </P></p>

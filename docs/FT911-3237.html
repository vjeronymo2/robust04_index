			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Anxieties over tight timetabling - Local Taxation Reform PROPERTY valuation experts confirmed yesterday that there should be no insuperable barrier to banding all 22m homes in Britain prior to introducing the proposed successor to the poll tax. However, anxieties were expressed over the tight timetable if the new council tax is to be introduced by April, 1993, and over some details which have clearly not yet been considered fully. There was relief in the valuation profession that ministers had decided in favour of a rating system based on capital values, rather than returning to the old, discredited system of rental values or recommending site valuation. The essential point is that the chosen method does not entail a property by property valuation, but simply the allocation of each property to one of the proposed bands. In most cases this should present no difficulty, as the old rating lists and valuations have been retained and were updated until the introduction of the poll tax last year. There is also a wealth of additional information from local property sales. 'The basic prescription of 22m homes allocated to seven bands is sensible and, for 90 per cent of properties, readily achievable,' said Mr Michael Pattison, secretary general of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. Mr Charles Partridge of Herring Son &amp; Daw, the chartered surveyors, said: 'It is the ideal approach because everyone understands capital values, and putting each property into a broad band is not a difficult job.' The Inland Revenue's valuation office will be responsible for allocating each property to one of the seven bands, which in England will range from up to Pounds 40,000 to over Pounds 160,000, with lower levels operating in Scotland and Wales. But because its resources are already fully stretched by appeals against uniform business rate demands, much of the work is certain to be contracted out to private sector professionals. According to the RICS, the government could adopt a 'beacon' system of valuation under which a typical property would be chosen as the basis of valuation for similar properties in the same area. A terrace house, for example, could be used to provide a representative value for all properties in the same terrace, and in some cases whole areas could be valued in this way. The assumption is that most householders would be likely to accept the banding decisions, which because of the amount of information available, should be consistent with their own views on the market value of their homes. This method of valuation would be a rough and ready means of valuation and so a right of appeal will be vital. Problems arise at the margin of each band and at the precise point in a street or estate where the properties have been allocated to the next band. Mr Pattison forecast that in some cases there could be agitation to get a property or housing estate into a higher band, despite the cost, because of the extra social cachet this could provide. Unlike the rating system, home improvements will not automatically mean a change of band, and any alterations might only be taken into account when a property changes hands. Among questions still to be answered are whether leasehold properties will be valued at their freehold value; how will 'unorthodox' types of property such as caravans and houseboats be treated; and will banding be subject to some form of indexation.</p>

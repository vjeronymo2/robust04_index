			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Arts: High-spirited Rossini at the Pesaro festival On the further side of Italy, Pesaro sits on the sea just south of Rimini. It was the birthplace of Gioachino Rossini, to whom it owes substantial benefactions, though he never returned to live there. There is a Fondazione Rossini for musicological studies, and for many summers now a Rossini Opera Festival (sponsored this year by Scavolini) which takes account of the latest findings in Rossini research. The first of the Rossini operas in the current festival was L'Italiana in Algeri - 'The Italian Girl in Algiers' - in a larky production by Dario Fo, the theatrical master-of-all-trades. The first edition of the score called for several comic dancers and acrobats besides the singing principals; Fo supplied a whole troupe of them, enthusiastically playing exotic animals, the Bey's slaves and eunuchs, and many fanciful supernumeraries. They sported in the shifting waves of a canvas sea with porpoises, flying fish and drowning sailors; during the longer arias, they mimed comments and distractions. There was a wealth of comic ideas in the costumes and the ever-shifting sets, too, and a lot of cheerful grossness. As usual Fo wanted to find a humane message in the show as well, and decided that its heroes - the Bey's Italian captive Lindoro and his newly shipwrecked compatriot Isabella - represented modern, enlightened Man and Woman against unregenerate machismo. (The plot is too elaborate to recount, but imagine Mozart's Seraglio with an extra twist or three.) The actual cast lived up to that with variable success. Isabella was the American Jennifer Larmore, currently the queen of Handelian sopranos. The fluidity and dark richness of the voice are remarkable, and her confidence boundless; there was no arguing with it. Almost as striking, though less favoured by her part as the Bey's unhappy wife, was Inger Dam-Jensen, last year's Cardiff 'Singer of the World'. In secondary roles Ildebrando D'Arcangelo and the young Russian Svetlana Sidorova shone, and Bruno Pratico invested bumbling old 'Uncle' Taddeo with the customary smirks and tics. The leading men were less happy. Donato Di Stefano's Bey Mustafa, because he was unwell the night I heard him, and thus unable to provide full vocal weight for this overweening monster; Markus Schafer's personable Lindoro (a late substitute), because his tenor was quite unready for the music. Truth to tell, he did some stylish things in quick music - but at the extreme heights of his first Cavatina the voice became a banshee screech. The Pesaro audience decided at once that it hated him, and booed him implacably. David Robertson (of the Ensemble InterContemporain) fared no better with them, though the orchestra of Bologna's Teatro Communale sounded well enough under him. Perhaps the audience resented his gentle protests on behalf of the unlucky Schafer ; but perhaps also they thought, as I did, that so much imperfect ensemble between orchestra and singers was unacceptable at a fourth performance. Yet even the ruckus was good-humoured; Fo's high-spirited production made it hard for anybody to feel otherwise.</p>

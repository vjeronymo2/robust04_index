			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Text of President Li Teng-hui's national affairs address to </F> the Fourth Extraordinary Session of the Second National Assembly  on 19 May: "Spare No Effort To Meet the Challenge in the Face of  a Changing International Situation"]    [Text] Chairman of the National Assembly, and lady and  gentlemen delegates:    Today, I feel greatly honored to be able to deliver a report  on the state of the country to the Fourth Extraordinary Session  of the Second National Assembly in the capacity of president of  the Republic of China [ROC].    Over the past four decades, the ROC in Taiwan, supported by  the determination and solidarity of our compatriots who fought  arduously, overcame numerous difficulties, and created a  multiparty democratic political system unprecedented in the  history of the Chinese nation, setting an example for the  world's developing countries in economic development and  political democracy. The people of the whole country are proud  of this achievement.    However, the world keeps on revolving and the international  situation keeps on changing. Not only should we not feel  complacent with ourselves, but we should step forward bravely to  meet the challenges of the future. Today, with the end of the  Cold War and the international order waiting to be rebuilt, the  ROC is still confronted with the Chinese Communist regime, which  is pursuing a dictatorial rule and accelerating its military  strength and has never abandoned its ambition to invade Taiwan  with force. While doing our best to cope with fast-changing  international relations, we must break the Chinese Communists'  diplomatic blockade to win a place in the international  community. Especially after we have become economically  prosperous and created a democratic political system, we must  work harder to improve the quality of life and attach importance  to human dignity. We must seek consensus with regard to  traditions and modernization and concepts and behavior so we can  join hands in creating peace and harmony.    Our past efforts have laid a sound foundation for future  development. Henceforth, with the concerted efforts of the  people of the whole country, we will certainly be able to  overcome difficulties and build a modern, prosperous, and urbane  society in which there is justice and mutual respect.  <H5>  The Foundation of the Rule of Law Is Improving </H5>   Since I was elected the eighth president of the ROC by the  National Assembly, I have always been aware of the heavy  responsibility on my shoulders, and I hope the foundation for  the rule of law needed for our country's long-term development  will be built at an early date.    To deal with the matter of constitutional reform before the  country's reunification, four years ago we invited noted figures  at home and abroad to a conference to discuss state affairs. We  have made a big stride forward in constitutional reform based on  the measures adopted at the conference. According to our reform  procedures, we terminated the period of mobilization for the  suppression of the communist rebellion; opened up a new era of  peaceful competition between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait;  retired the deputies to the First National Assembly; and elected  new deputies to the Second National Assembly. We have also  built a legal basis for local self-government. Clear standards  were established for the development of the economy, science and  technology, environmental protection, agriculture, and fishing  industry; for the advancement of health insurance for the whole  people; and for the protection of the rights and interests of  women, handicapped people, aborigines, compatriots in the Kinmen  and Matsu region, and Overseas Chinese. As for the method of  electing the president and vice president and other related  questions, they concern the perfection of the system of  constitutional government and their impact will be far-reaching.  With regard to these issues, I trust the deputies will heed the  people's will, pool your wisdom, and make the most appropriate  decision in accordance with the basic framework of the  five-power Constitution after analyzing the present state of the  development of constitutional government in our country and the  needs for national reunification in the future.    In implementing democracy, the establishment of party  politics is a major task that should be neglected. The more  plural and open the society is, the more it will rely on  political parties to play a role in integrating values and  forming a consensus. Currently, our party politics have not  operated in a mature way; however, as long as we are  open-minded, far-sighted, have the daring to institute the  system, and tolerate and respect each other, we will make our  ideal come true in a short time.    In implementing constitutional reform, the political  structure and development objectives, following the end of the  mobilization for the suppression of communist rebellion period,  will be readjusted. How to implement the revised Constitution  in terms of laws and policies, is a major task that should be  carried out earnestly by our government. Today, since our  democratic society is taking shape, we are confident and  determined that the ROC will become a first-class country in the  world and our people, first-class people in the world.  <H5>  Economic Construction That Increases Our Actual Strength </H5>   Over the past four decades, the ROC has concentrated efforts  on economic development and created an "economic miracle" that  attracts worldwide attention. The solid national strength we  have built has not only improved the standard of living but has  also become a powerful backing force for expanding international  relations. Under a situation of global economic recession, our  economic growth rate was 5.9 percent in 1993 -- evidence of a  brisk economy. However, in the face of the challenges of  domestic economic transition and readjustment of an  international economic order, we should accelerate structural  readjustment and increase our economic strength, so as to score  even greater economic achievements.    Therefore, in 1993 our government proposed an "Economic  Revitalization Package" and 12 projects in an attempt to  strengthen basic construction of our society, stimulate  investment from the private sector, accelerate upgrading  industries, and make greater contributions to the world economy.    To implement the policy on economic revitalization, our  government has worked out some concrete supporting measures. In  instituting systems, we should accelerate liberalizing and  internationalizing our economy and privatizing the  government-run enterprises, as well as institute a legal and  institutional framework in line with international practices.  In improving manpower quality, we should encourage even more  scientists and technicians abroad to start an undertaking in our  country, assist enterprises at home to engage in research and  development on high technology products, and improve the  technological level. In land utilization, we are pushing  forward policies on releasing farmland and improving land  utilization, so as to return interests from land development to  the whole nation and lighten the financial burden of public  construction.    International trade is the main force of our economy.  Changes in the international economic climate will have an  impact on domestic economic development. The international  economic system has undergone drastic changes in recent years.  The formation of North American and European economic blocs in  1993, operation of the "Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation" forum  in an active way, and agreements reached at the Uruguay Round  show that in the future, a new international economic order will  be established under the two major axes of regional economic  integration and trade liberalization. In view of this  situation, our government has made positive and responsive  preparations.    First of all, we will make positive efforts  to join international economic organizations to secure  international dialogue channels. We are now prepared to join  GATT. Although this will have some impacts on the domestic  markets, the government will take prudent measures to safeguard  the rights and interests of farmers and domestic industries.  Second, in addition to continuing to strengthen bilateral trade  relations with Japan, the United States, and Europe, we will  actively promote economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific  region, especially our economic cooperation with Southeast Asian  nations. By doing so, we will be able to make use of Southeast  Asia's rich resources and help countries in this region develop  their economies, thus establishing cooperative and mutually  beneficial relations with them. Moreover, Taiwan's good  geographical position is also a favorable factor that we can  make good use of. We will woo international enterprises to  invest in Taiwan in a planned manner and use Taiwan as a base  for entering the Asia-Pacific market, to develop Taiwan into the  business center of the Asia-Pacific region, and to expand the  space for Taiwan's long-range development.  <H5>  A Newly-Born and Diversified Culture </H5>   Culture is a heritage of history, crystallization of wisdom,  and distillation of social activities. A glance at world  history tells us that only societies with a highly developed  economy and in which people can freely express their will can  develop a spectacular culture. Therefore, a country's cultural  level is an important indicator of its national strengthens.  Today, the ROC has created an affluent and democratic society  that had never been seen in Chinese history. We will work even  harder to add new vitality to the Chinese culture.    The Chinese nation has a long history and rich cultural  heritage. This of course is an inexhaustible resource. But,  culture is not historical ruins that never change -- it should  be a life force that continues to grow in daily life and  spiritually. Therefore, we must not let the substance of  culture be confined within traditional cultural relics and  classic inheritance. Instead, we should inject new vitality  into our traditional culture to create new life.    To bring about new cultural development, the government, in  addition to continuing to protect and promote our fine  traditional culture, will encourage the people to assimilate all  kinds of cultures and to blend them with our traditional culture  so that our traditional culture will assume a brand new look.    Because Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu are at the edge of  the Asian continent, they have been a region where Oriental and  Western cultures meet and where continental and oceanic  characteristics merge -- this region is the most ideal place for  the development of a diversified culture. Therefore, we can now  see that cultural and artistic activities have developed  vibrantly in this region and can feel the vigor born out of  various cultures. The cultural potential accumulated by all our  social strata is now ready to be released and the "new Chinese  culture" will blossom soon. Following our economic and  political accomplishments, culture will be another sphere in  which we score great achievements.    A Streamlined, Solid, and Strong National Defense  Force    National security is the precondition for a nation's  survival  and a society's development, and a strong national defense force  is the cornerstone of national security. Although currently the  international situation tends to be relaxed, regional conflicts  have erupted around the world from time to time. In Asia, North  Korea is developing nuclear weapons and there are disputes over  territorial sovereignty and resources in the South China Sea,  casting clouds of instability over countries in this region.  And, in recent years, the Chinese Communists have continued to  increase their defense budget, expand their naval and air force  armament, purchase sophisticated weapons, and redeploy their  troops in the mainland's southeast coastal areas. All this has  increased the potential threat to us. For this reason,  maintaining a strong national defense force is still an  important goal of our policy.    Our current defense policy is to build a high-quality  defense  force of fewer men and high combat capability; and to devise a  defense strategy according to the priority order of gaining air  superiority and command of the sea and developing an  anti-landing force, according to the principle of developing the  three armed services in a balanced way, and starting from  reducing the size of the troops, increasing the troops'  firepower, and improving the troops' mobility. In recent years,  we have readjusted the military's organizational structure,  downsized the troops, improved the military education system,  refined the noncommissioned officer system, updated our weapons  and armament, improved the troops' training, revised and  restructured the logistics system, and improved the livelihood  of military officers and men to build a strong and dependable  defense force.    The idea of building up the Armed Forces at the current  stage  is, based on future combat requirements and the available  national defense manpower and financial resources, to plan for  the defense force for the next decade, to downsize the troops,  to maintain an ever-ready force, and to maintain a large number  of reserve personnel. In addition to gradually reducing the  troops to 400,000 men, we are studying changing the mobilization  system to maintain a large number of reserve personnel during  peace time and to enable them to swiftly support combat when war  breaks out.    Without national defense, there is no national security,  hence, no construction and prosperity. Modern national defense  is all-people defense. I hope all the people, based on our  common sense of patriotism, will regard national defense as an  important link in the nation's development and will unite to  support our national defense efforts to build a modern national  defense system to ensure the nation's security.  <H5>  Cultivate a Mutual-Trust Cross-Strait Relationship </H5>   The ROC Government's mainland policy is to achieve national  unification following the procedures laid down in the Guidelines  for National Unification and on the basis of democracy, freedom,  and equal distribution of wealth. Over the last few years, the  government has gradually lifted control over people-to-people  communications between the two sides of the Strait, thus  gradually increasing cross-Strait relative visiting and exchange  in the economic, trade, cultural, academic, and sports fields.  This development is very important to enhancing mutual  understanding between the two sides.    The two sides across the Strait have been split and  governed separately for more than four decades. As a result of  different ideologies, there is a giant gap between the two sides  in terms of politics, economics, and social systems. To narrow  the gap and seek a consensus, the two sides should accumulate  experience and build mutual trust through various talks and  routine consultations. The Koo-Wang meeting held in Singapore in  April 1993 has set up channels for institutionalized contacts  and talks and has worked out some topics for future discussions.  This concrete result is a good start in institutionalizing and  regularizing cross-Strait interaction between the  nongovernmental organizations.    In the years ahead, the ROC will continue to adhere to the  principle of rationality, peace, equality, and reciprocity to  develop cross-Strait relations. However, we would also like to  reiterate that the Chinese Communist authority, refusing to face  the reality that the two sides are split and governed  separately, is the major reason the two sides have not been able  to build a mutual trust. We want to solemnly call on the  Chinese Communist authority to face the new cross-Strait  situation of peaceful competition with a new understanding,  knowledge, and policies and to make contributions to opening a  new chapter in Chinese history.  <H5>  Foreign Relations Promoted in a Practical Way </H5>   After the ending of the Cold War, the international  situation  has shifted from military standoff to economic cooperation. In  view of the international situation, the focus of the ROC's  diplomatic work is to fully utilize its economic power and show  its sincerity and competence to share and fulfill international  responsibilities, so as to call international attention to the  fact that the ROC on Taiwan exists and to call respect for ROC's  aspiration and rights to participate in international affairs.    As far as concrete policies are concerned, our government  has  earnestly developed substantial relations with countries around  the world and strived to join in international organizations to  promote international cooperation and to seek peaceful  settlement for international issues through multilateral  consultations, according to the principle of making extensive  friendly contacts and making contributions to the international  community,    In recent years, we have scored remarkable results in  strengthening relations and expanding cooperation and exchanges  with countries with or without diplomatic ties with our country.  Many countries have broken the past taboo to develop a higher  level of contacts with our country. Over the past year,  international leaders such as former British prime minister,  Madame Thatcher; former U.S. President, Mr. Bush; and former  USSR president, Mr. Gorbachev came to visit our country. These  visits have further widened our international horizon and have  called international attention to our country.    In February this year, I visited the Philippines,  Indonesia, and Thailand. I met with the heads of state of the  three countries and exchanged views with them. This is an  important milestone in the cooperative relations between our  country and Southeast Asian countries and is a pioneering move  to expand all-directional international relations for our  country.    In developing multilateral relations, we will continue to  push our established policy of joining the United Nations. In  addition, we will not give up any opportunity to participate in  international organizations or international meetings, so as to  expand our area of activity in the international arena and to  establish an international status for our country.    Even though the Chinese Communists have vainly attempted to  undermine our international relations and downgraded our  international status, our determination to expand pragmatic  diplomacy will never change. Because the ROC is a peace-loving  country, we are earnestly willing to do our best to join the  countries and peoples of the world in working for peace,  cooperation, and prosperity of the human race.  <H5>  With Consensus, Success Can Be Expected </H5>   Ladies and gentlemen, since I was elected president, I have  always been aware of my heavy responsibility. I have constantly  encouraged myself, and I hope that with your support and the  concerted efforts of the people of the whole country, the goal  of enhancing the people's welfare and establishing a system  under which the country is well-governed and enjoys lasting  stability will be realized.    The road we have traveled over the past four decades proves  that we have been making efforts in the right direction. We  have not worked in vain. Today, the economic prosperity, the  practice of democratic politics, and social stability in the  Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu regions show we are already  standing on another new historical starting point. As we look  into the future, we see the world situation is changing and  treacherous. The situation in Mainland China is unpredictable,  and we are being tested by numerous obstacles and difficulties.  However, our successful "Taiwan experience" tells us that so  long as the people of the country form a consensus on "the  community of life" and enhance the plentiful vitality of  society, they will be able to stand firm like a rock and create  another new situation.    The 21st century is approaching. To meet the challenges of  the new era, we must widen our horizon. The ROC can neither  alienate itself from the mainland nor isolate itself from the  world. Henceforth, we will, of course, continue our reform and  respect the people's will. We will not only build the Taiwan,  Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu regions into a modern society that  conforms to world trends and advanced standards, but we will  also strive to lay a solid foundation for a free, democratic,  prosperous, and unified New China.    In conclusion, let us wish the ROC and its people prosperity  and peace! At the same time, I wish you all good health and  happiness! Thank you.</p>

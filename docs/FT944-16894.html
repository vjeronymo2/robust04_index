			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / International Company News: Outokumpu ahead at FM557m Outokumpu, the Finnish mining and metals group, yesterday announced a FM557m (Dollars 117.6m) profit before extraordinary items and taxes for the first eight months of the year. The group said foreign exchange gains and reduced financial costs had enabled it to lift its profit from FM130m in 1993 in spite of a lower operating result. It also highlighted the impact of cost-cutting and increased metals consumption but said these were more than offset by a 15 per cent strengthening of the markka against the dollar and generally weak metals prices. In upbeat vein, Mr Jyrki Juusela, chief executive, said the group could expect buoyant conditions over the next few years. 'We can expect to register both growth and profitability improvement, accelerating as market conditions continue to improve,' he said. The group, which saw state ownership fall to 40 per cent during the summer following a global share offering, said sales were static at FM10.9bn, partly because of the stronger markka. It also said its 1993 figures contained a FM900m contribution from operations which have since been sold. Operating profit fell to FM628m from FM653m. The latest figure was fattened by FM210m in inventory gains, compared with FM17m in losses in the comparable 1993 period. The copper products division saw the biggest improvement, with profits climbing to FM219m from FM29m. In stainless steel, profits fell to FM518m from FM635m, while technology slumped to a FM62m loss from a FM24m profit. Base metals recorded a FM6m profit after a FM28m deficit. Reduced debt, lower interest rates and exchange gains meant the group's net financial costs dropped to FM71m from FM523m. The group said its performance would reflect rising metal prices and expanded production following investments in its base metals and stainless steel activities. Its equity-to-assets ratio is 11 per cent higher than at the beginning of the year, at 38.0 per cent.</p>

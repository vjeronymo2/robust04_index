			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Why Edinburgh has placed its faith in UK shares - Investment Trusts THERE ARE few prizes for being second and Edinburgh Investment Trust, the second largest investment trust, sometimes misses out on the attention accorded to its bigger rival, Foreign &amp; Colonial. Edinburgh is one of the oldest investment trusts and it is named after the city where it was founded in 1889, with a starting capital of Pounds 450,000. By the end of 1992, that figure had grown to more than Pounds 1bn. Like Foreign &amp; Colonial, Edinburgh is classed as an international general trust but you would not guess it from a glance at its current spread of assets - 90 per cent in the UK. The trust emphasises that this is not a policy change, but a strategy change. 'At the moment the UK market is relatively speaking good value in terms of capital and income growth,' says manager Ian Massie. Edinburgh is quite ready to switch its assets into overseas markets if they appear more attractive. However, Edinburgh has consistently maintained a much higher weighting in the UK market than its international rivals. This has not helped its relative performance over the long term. According to figures from the Association of Investment Trust Companies, Edinburgh was last (out of 14 trusts in the sector) in terms of share price performance over 10 years and 11th in terms of net asset value performance. Other trusts with higher weightings in the US have benefited from both a strong Wall Street and a rising dollar in recent years. Ian Massie says the UK weighting has enabled the trust to deliver both a higher yield (currently 4.2 per cent) than most of its rivals and higher dividend growth - 16.5 per cent per annum over the past five years, compared with a sector average of 15.4 per cent. And this week's base rate cut and jump in London share prices makes the recent shift appear well timed. The UK concentration means that the trust's 10 largest stocks are well known names. They are: British Gas, Lloyds, Grand Met, Shell, BT, Abbey National, NW Water, Smithkline Beecham, BAT, BTR. 'Because of the size of the trust, we will tend to be invested in top 200 companies,' says Massie. Outside the UK, the rest of the portfolio divides between the US (5 per cent) Europe (2 per cent), Japan (2 per cent) and the Far East (1 per cent). Edinburgh is also highly geared. Although its gross assets were over Pounds 1,066m on January 26, its net assets were Pounds 860m. At the moment, a major chunk of those borrowings are invested in gilts, which because of the current difference between long term and short term interest rates, gives a boost to Edinburgh's income. Ian Massie has worked for Dunedin since 1985 and took over as manager of Edinburgh in 1989 from Grant Cochrane, who had managed the trust for 20 years. Massie trained as a chartered accountant and is a 36 year old Aberdonian. Massie stresses the importance of Dunedin's investment trust team - consisting of Brian Tait, Graham McGeorge and himself - which manages four of the five trusts in the stable. The Edinburgh-based Dunedin was formed in 1984 and now has Pounds 3.5bn of assets under management. An investment group of senior managers decides on Dunedin's asset allocation and that is reflected across the board. Massie says the trust follows a value investing strategy and has an in-house database which searches for undervalued stocks. However, he says the criteria are too complex to be explained in the context of an article. EIT's UK bias means that it has been fully Pepable since January 1 and is the largest trust that can be held in Pep form. It has had some success in attracting private investors; the number of Edinburgh shareholders rose 20 per cent in 1992 and is 40 per cent up on 1990. In some ways, Edinburgh now sits rather oddly in the international sector, since its overseas holdings are no larger than a UK income trust like Lowland (featured last week). But Hamish Buchan, analyst at County NatWest Wood Mac, says of the switch into the UK: 'It takes a bold move to make you outperform' and if it succeeds, Edinburgh may get some of the attention it has been denied in the past. Key facts. The trust had net assets of Pounds 860m and a market capitalisation of Pounds 739m, as of January 26. On that day, the nav per share was 290.4p, the share price was 257p, a discount of 11.5 per cent. The dividend yield is 4.2 per cent and the annual fee is 0.3 per cent. Board. Ivor Guild, a partner of solicitors Shepherd &amp; Wedderburn, is chairman of Edinburgh and has been since 1974. Other directors are: Grant Cochrane, a former manager, is non-executive director of LASMO; Peter Dunn also a director of Property Security Investment Trust; Sir David Nickson is chairman of Clydesdale Bank; Sir Robert Smith is chairman of Alliance Trust; Robin Young, a former director of Martin Currie, is also a director of Securities Trust of Scotland. New appointments to the board are Sir Chips Keswick, chairman of Hambros Bank and the Earl of Eglinton &amp; Winton, chairman of Gerrard Vivian Grey. Savings scheme and Pep details. The savings scheme has a minimum investment of Pounds 30 per month or a lump sum of Pounds 250. There is no broker's commission and the only cost is government stamp duty of 0.5 per cent. The Pep plan has the same minimum investments. There is a Pounds 30 set-up charge on the Pep and an annual fee of 0.5 per cent. Two free cash withdrawals can be made from a plan each year.</p>

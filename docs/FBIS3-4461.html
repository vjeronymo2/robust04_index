			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 12 March, in an interview with this reporter,  Sun Weiben, head of Heilongjiang Province deputation to the  second session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC],  dwelt on his own opinions on developing the socialist commodity  economy and building the legal system.    He said: The development of the market economy requires the  strengthening of legislation work and the market economy is  precisely the economy of the legal system. Without a perfect  legal system as an guarantee, it is impossible for us to  establish and develop the market economy. Although a big  improvement has been effected in the quantity and quality of  legislation over the past few years, many problems have cropped  up in the linkage to law enforcement. We have seen a serious  situation of refusing to observe laws, to enforce laws, and to  punish law breakers. Many laws, rules, and regulations that are  urgently needed are still missing. We still lack sufficient  laws to control some obscene and gambling articles on the  cultural market. We need legislation to strengthen  macroeconomic control. Otherwise, we will be unable to ensure  the demands of socialism and to ensure the balance between total  supply and total demand. Then, unfair competition and operation  will emerge.    With regard to the methods to resolve the above-mentioned  problems, Sun Weiben said: We should use the reform spirit to  strengthen legislation work and organically combine legislation  work with the process of reform. At the same time, we should  strengthen the drawing up of local rules and regulations. In  this regard, we should have foresight and adopt measures in  advance. We should strengthen the supervision over law  enforcement. Laws are a mere scrap of paper if they are not  supervised and enforced. Sun Weiben said: Now, supervision  over law enforcement is a weak link. To effect a steady and  rapid development of the socialist market economy, we must  strengthen supervision in the following three levels: First,  the supervision by people's congress; second, the supervision by  media; and third, the supervision by the masses. At the same  time, we should give full play to the role of people's deputies,  understand the voice of the masses, pay attention to the work  concerning the masses in electoral areas, and do tangible deeds  for the masses.</p>

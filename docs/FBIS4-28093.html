			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 4 KYODO -- Japan will hold the first  working-level defense meeting with Germany on Monday and Tuesday  in Bonn as part of its program for promoting security dialogue  with other nations, government officials said Saturday [4 June].    At the meeting, the Defense Agency's senior staffs, headed  by  Defense Councilor Ken Sato, will discuss with their German  counterparts various security issues, including U.N.-sponsored  peacekeeping operations, the officials said.    The joint talks were first proposed by German Defense  Minister Volker Ruehe last November to then Defense Minister  Keisuke Nakanishi while he was visiting Tokyo.    The agency plans to hold bilateral meetings regularly  thereafter because the two nations share common interest in  acquiring permanent U.N. Security Council membership, defense  sources said.    The Japanese defense officials are also scheduled to stop  over in France to exchange views with the country's defense  officers before heading for Germany, the government officials  said.    Japan's Peacekeeping Cooperation Law, enacted in May 1992,  restricts overseas operation of Self-Defense Forces troops to  noncombat duties, as shown in the peacekeeping operation in  Cambodia from 1992 to 1993.    Germany's Constitution also prohibits troops from  participating in U.N. combat missions outside the North Atlantic  Treaty Organization (NATO) territory.    But in attempting to occupy permanent Security Council  seats,  the two nations are likely to be more pressured to expand their  role in U.N. peacekeeping operations.    World War II victors Britain, China, France, Russia and the  United States are the only permanent members at present.</p>

			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / European neighbours fall out over garden gnomes Mr Stanislaw Sawicki says he no longer understands the meaning of free trade. 'All I want to do is to sell my garden gnomes. But the Germans will not allow them into the country,' he said outside his small factory. 'If the European Union means anything at all, it should be about free trade. Our gnomes represent many of the things that are wrong with the EU.' Two years ago, Mr Sawicki, like other budding entrepreneurs in Nowa Sol, a small Polish town 80km from the border, decided to start manufacturing garden gnomes for the German market. 'The Germans loved our gnomes,' he said. 'They were just like the German ones, and they were much, much cheaper. Here was a real chance for competition.' Business was brisk. Mr Sawicki and his staff of six were making 4,800 plaster and 2,000 plastic gnomes a month. 'We would just go across the border and sell them . . . We were selling the big gypsum gnomes, which are 75cm high, for about DM13 (Pounds 5.30), and the plastic ones for about DM24. Normally, the German-made gnomes cost over DM100.' Then things started to go wrong. 'One day, the German customs officials would not let my gnomes cross the border. They said we were, well, I suppose pirating the German design,' said Mr Sawicki. 'But what is it all about? Business is business. The German gnome manufacturers are just afraid of competition.' German customs officials, who since unification spend a great deal of time trying to prevent counterfeit goods entering the country from eastern Europe, say they are simply applying the law to the Polish gnomes. Mr Gerd Grau, a senior federal customs official responsible for the eastern German state of Brandenburg which adjoins Poland, said his staff were trying to stem the smuggling of pirated goods into Germany. 'German designs, and other labels, whether they relate to clothes, sportwear, perfume, or tape cassettes, are being copied and produced very cheaply in eastern Europe and making their way into Germany - garden gnomes included. I'll show you what I mean,' he said. Mr Grau took out a large file containing photographs of garden gnomes. 'You see these gnomes. These are authentic German gnomes. If any Pole tries to bring an exact replica of any of these designs across the border, we cannot allow them into the country.' Polish gnome manufacturers can apply for the licence to copy and produce a German garden gnome. Mr Franz Sikora, an official at the patent office, said: 'The Poles could pay a symbolic price for the licence by seeking permission from those German firms who hold the copyright. And then they would be free to sell their gnomes here in Germany.' German gnome manufacturers, however, are not keen on selling their copyright. Heissner, one of Germany's oldest companies specialising in garden gnomes, believes it is a question of preserving quality. 'We have been making and painting our gnomes by hand ever since we started back in 1880,' said Ms Helga Naueckert, for Heissner. 'We sell about 700,000 garden gnomes each year. Our gnomes are expensive. The 70cm-high ceramic gnomes cost DM269 and the plastic ones cost between DM100-DM140. But people pay for quality. I am not so sure this quality can be sold to the Poles.' Ms Naueckert admitted, however, that the Poles were attempting to introduce some competition into the market. 'Of course it is a question about protecting our copyright. But it is also about the market being exposed to more competition.' Some Polish gnome manufacturers have tried to get around the obstacle by selling their gnomes on the Polish side of the border crossing. 'I cannot get my gnomes into Germany any more. So I sell them on the roadside,' said Mr Roman Olba, a gnome exporter who buys his gnomes from the Nowa gnome enterprise in Nowa Sol. German day trippers are held crucial in helping to correct Poland's trade gap - Dollars 2bn in 1992. 'If we can't sell the gnomes in Germany, the Germans will come to Poland to buy them,' said Mr Jacek Szlachta, deputy director of Poland's central planning office. 'Over 40m Germans crossed into Poland last year. I reckon they each spend an average of DM50. This has already helped reduce our negative trade balance to Dollars 100m last year.' That is little comfort to Mr Olba. 'I can't live off selling the gnomes on the Polish roadside . . . I now have to drive to the Czech Republic and make my way over to Austria and Switzerland where I can earn hard currency. But that's a long drive.'</p>

			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Squabbles over IMF credit fund: The struggle to finance one of the Fund's most successful ventures THE International Monetary Fund and World Bank are never so happy as when producing acronyms. But during this week's IMF and World Bank annual meetings, one choice specimen - ESAF, standing for the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility - has been cropping up in speeches and conversations more than most. Through ESAF the IMF offers credits at concessional interest rates to some of the poorest developing nations, provided they carry out Fund-supervised economic reform programmes. Some 73 countries are eligible for the 0.5 per cent credits, which are paid back in up to 10 years. Since the late 1980s, about Dollars 5.6bn (Pounds 3.63bn) has been channelled to 42 countries under ESAF and its predecessor, the structural adjustment facility. ESAF is generally considered a success. An IMF study of 19 recipient countries found that their annual growth rates rose from 2 per cent to 3 per cent after ESAF finance and reform programmes. Average export volume growth rose to about 7 per cent from 2 per cent. Official reserves rose markedly and average inflation, although still high and in double digits, fell by about a fifth. But ESAF expires in November. Unless a successor is agreed, developing countries will lose an important source of finance. The IMF's problem is the deadline comes when many industrial country members are strapped for cash. The Fund wants to set up a new facility which can lend SDR 5bn (Pounds 4.66bn) over three years. But this sum, while large, is not very contentious because it is provided in loans from industrial countries at market related interest rates. The money required for interest rate subsidies goes into a separate account, is substantial and is charged to the budgets of countries that provide it. With aid budgets under pressure, countries are thinking twice about their contributions. Because ESAF loans have long repayment periods, the IMF estimates SDR 2.lbn will be needed. The IMF's industrial country members say they want a new ESAF. But comments this week by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, that Britain was unlikely to contribute to the new ESAF are a measure of the difficulties confronting Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director, in drumming up finance for the facility. Britain has been a generous supplier of funds to finance interest rate subsidies in the existing ESAF. By the end of the IMF's last financial year on April 30, some SDR 2.54bn were pledged to the ESAF subsidy account by 24 mainly industrial nations. The UK share, at SDR 361m, was well over 10 per cent. Only Japan and France promised more. Both Japan and France have said that they will contribute to the new facility. Mr Hirohisa Fujii, the Japanese finance minister, announced that Japan was ready to provide an amount 'comparable' to its existing contributions. Japan has lent SDR 2.2bn at market rates towards the capital of the existing ESAF and has pledged SDR 393m in interest subsidies. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French finance minister, has said that France will provide 15 per cent of the capital to the new facility, a sum roughly in line with the SDR 800m lent at present to the ESAF capital account at market rates. Mr Alphandery also said France would provide funds for the subsidised interest rates so long as an equitable burden sharing could be arranged. The UK is pushing for more generous relief of official debt to ease the plight of the poorest developing countries. But the chancellor's threat to cease contributions to the ESAF subsidy account raises the prospect of a burden sharing row. Germany is also reluctant to dig into its coffers for ESAF. Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, said he had 'only very limited possibilities' because of budget constraints. Various ideas have been put forward for plugging the gap. Mr Clarke has exhumed a proposal advanced by Mr Norman Lamont, his predecessor, the IMF should sell some gold to finance ESAF. But this commands little support. The IMF has done its bit. It reduced the estimated capital needs of the new ESAF to SDR 5bn from SDR 6bn. Mr Camdessus has offered to provide SDR 500m-SDR 600m from IMF resources for the subsidy account in a move that would reduce its financing requirement to about SDR 1.5bn. With the deadline still two months away, some brinkmanship over ESAF is inevitable. Mr Clarke is certainly in a good position to fend off supplicants for renewed UK support because UK government spending plans for the years ahead are still being decided ahead of the November 30 budget. But the betting is still against an outcome in which ESAF would die. 'There will be some squabbling,' a senior official from the Group of Seven leading industrial countries predicted. 'But we will get it done. . .in enough time so that there won't be any interruption in the IMF's capacity to support Africa.'</p>

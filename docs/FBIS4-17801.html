			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 27 Apr -- The State Duma has demanded of the  Russian Federation president the immediate firing of Minister of  Internal Affairs Viktor Yerin from his post and "to put his  constitutional powers to maximum use to set things to rights  without delay and in an uncompromising manner."    This is contained in a statement adopted today by an  overwhelming majority of votes -- 239 in favor, 11 against, and  four abstaining -- in connection with the murder of State Duma  Deputy Andrey Ayzderdzis. This crime, opine the authors of the  document, should spark resolute measures to combat crime.  Deputies think that the government and law and order protection  bodies are failing to take effective action to stop the criminal  encroachment against citizens "which threatens not just the  lives of individuals, but the very existence of Russian  statehood."</p>

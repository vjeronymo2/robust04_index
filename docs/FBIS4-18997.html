			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed RHR: "Crisis: Claes Says No Solution Other </F> Than Arusha Agreements"]    [Text] Brussels, 12 Apr (BELGA) -- There is no solution for  Rwanda other than the application of the Arusha peace  agreements, Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes stressed on  Tuesday [12 April]. Claes had been invited to the RTBF  [French-language Belgian Radio and Television] news broadcast.    "I hope that these agreements are not dead but I imagine  that  the wounds are such that some time will be necessary to recreate  a climate allowing meetings and negotiations to be restarted."  Having said that, Claes continued, "to be honest, I see no  other solution. I believe that the Hutus and the Tutsis, and the  different political parties must inevitably meet in a huge  effort of conciliation which must aim to lead to the formation  of a national government of reconciliation, in a national  Parliament of reconciliation, and which must also lead to the  merger of the two armies followed by a large-scale  demobilization."    "I see no other solution, there is not other solution," the  minister insisted. Nevertheless he recognized that there were,  "next to the ethnic confrontation which has a long history,  internal political divisions and also groups which have far more  specific interests and want the current situation to last....  Many (things) are based, I fear, on arms and drug dealing," he  added.    When asked about the Belgian presence within the UN force,  Claes repeated, as the prime minister and he had declared on  Monday in Parliament, that it was necessary to enlarge the  UNAMIR's [UN Mission in Rwanda] mandate, which was too  restricted.    "But I have my doubts about the willingness of the Security  Council to enlarge that mandate," he said.    However, Claes defended the Belgian participation in the UN  mission, at the request of the two parties, the government and  the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front]. And without wanting to  comment on Belgian aid cooperation in the future, Claes said:  "I believe that in any event we do not have the right to  abandon the African continent, from the ethical point of view it  is not defendable. Second, I believe that cooperation policies  must go further than purely humanitarian emergency aid. Third,  I believe that these policies must continue to be based on the  respect of human rights and the development of democracy, even  if Western democratic forms are not necessarily those which can  function in Africa...."    "It is not because we have had some failures in  democratization initiatives that we must allow ourselves to be  discouraged and give up," the minister concluded.</p>

			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / International Company News: Gibraltar group builds 7% stake in Montedison Shares in Montedison, the Italian industrial group which is part of the troubled Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) holding company, rose by L11 to L1,197 yesterday after news that a mysterious buyer now controlled almost 7 per cent of the stock. The admission came from Codelouf, a little-known Gibraltar-based concern operating out of London. A lawyer acting for Codelouf said it would own 4 per cent of Montedison's voting shares at the end of the current stock market account, ending February 28. Codelouf, whose ultimate owners are unknown, has also acquired about 380m Montedison share warrants, accounting for a further 2.9 per cent of the voting capital on conversion. The news goes some way to explain the surge in Montedison's share price since shareholders and bank creditors agreed on a restructuring plan late last year. The restructuring, which has seen Ferfin's stake in Montedison fall to about 30 per cent from around 48 per cent, also involved one of Italy's largest share and warrant issues. Rather than being left to the underwriters - largely made up of Montedison's leading bank creditors - the issue was strongly taken up, and the group's stock has powered ahead on the back of extremely high daily trading volumes. The high turnover and steadily rising share price have triggered speculation about stake building, possibly ahead of a bid. Montedison is Ferfin's main industrial operation, and controls a number of important subsidiaries such as Montecatini (chemicals), Eridania Beghin-Say (sugar) and Edison (energy). Among potential raiders are the Fiat-controlled Gemina holding company, possibly in conjunction with Mediobanca, and Mr Sergio Cragnotti, a former Ferruzzi executive, who now runs an independent merchant bank. All have denied stake building. Earlier this month, Italy's Consob stock market watchdog confirmed the extraordinary volume of trading in Montedison shares, but said no shareholder had yet reached 2 per cent of the capital, at which stage a formal announcement must be made.</p>

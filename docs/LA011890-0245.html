			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> $450 WILL BUY ONLY A CHEAP TICKET FOR THE SUPER BOWL  </P> <P> Tickets for the Jan. 28 Super Bowl game in the Louisiana Superdome are going  for about $450 each -- and that's for the cheap seats.  </P> <P> The prices are set by brokers who make the market in tickets for the big game,  this time with the San Francisco 49ers and the Denver Broncos.  </P> <P> The best seats in the Superdome should sell for about $1,250 said Ken Solky,  general manager of Murray's Tickets in Los Angeles. The least desirable seats  -- in the upper end zones -- can be bought for $450, he said.  </P> <P> Although the National Football League set $125 as the face value of a ticket,  the tickets are sold out. Those who still want one must buy from brokers.  </P> <P> "With (hotel) rooms being high down there, it makes this game a little too  expensive for the average fan," Solky said Tuesday.  </P> <P> For the corporate set -- the high rollers who want to be in New Orleans to  party during Super Bowl week -- price is no object, Solky said.  </P> <P> "Those folks don't care who plays or how much it costs," he said.  </P> <P> Murray's is based in California, one of two states where it is legal to resell  a ticket for more than its face value. The other state is Texas.  </P> <P> In Louisiana, "scalping," the selling of a ticket for more than its face value,  is illegal.  </P></p>

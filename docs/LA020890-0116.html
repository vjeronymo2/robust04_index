			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FISHERMEN TO PLACE SALMON IN HARBOR;  </P> <P> RECREATION: THE GROUP PLANS TO PUT 50,000 FISH IN OCEAN WATERS. IT IS THE FIRST  SUCH ATTEMPT IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.  </P> <P> Ventura County fishermen are putting the finishing touches on a project to  bring 50,000 king salmon to Oxnard's Channel Islands Harbor.  </P> <P> In the first such attempt in Southern California, the Ventura County chapter of  the United Anglers of California Research Institute will introduce the fish  into ocean waters.  </P> <P> If the project is successful, fishermen say, it could bring a major sport  fishing business to Ventura County and set a trend for areas of Los Angeles and  Orange counties.  </P> <P> "It could become a multimillion-dollar industry," said James Donlon, chairman  of the Ventura County chapter. "The project has the potential for establishing  a fishery that will be mind-boggling."  </P> <P> Such a venture would eliminate the need for people to leave Ventura County to  fish in Oregon, Washington or Mexico, he said.  </P> <P> Construction of three rearing pens to be attached to the Cisco docks in  Oxnard's Channel Islands Harbor is scheduled to be completed within a month.  Each wooden pen, supported on plastic floats, will measure 16 feet by 16 feet  and sink to a depth of 8 feet.  </P> <P> The fish will be reared in the pens for about five months until they weigh  about a quarter of a pound and are about 10 inches long. Then they will be  released.  </P> <P> The salmon should return to the area in two to three years when they are mature  fish, the group said.  </P> <P> The harbor was pronounced fit for fish after being tested for the level of  dissolved oxygen in the water.  </P></p>

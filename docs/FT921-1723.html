			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Danish Bonds: Political factors tighten investors' nerves DANISH economic indicators are pointing the right way for bond investors. Low inflation, moderate business growth and a strong external account should, all other things being equal, point to falling yields. As the Danish economy is currently more stable than the German economy, measured by inflation, there is a potential advantage in Danish bonds for investors who believe that yields on German bunds are likely to rise. But over the past few days the spread between yields on bunds and Danish government bonds has widened from around 50-60 basis points to 70-75 basis points. The main reason is a degree of nervousness in the market over Danish political developments, said Mr Birger Durhuus, analyst at Danse Bors, the broking arm of Den Danske Bank. Three events, which formally are unconnected but interact with each other as far as impact on the market is concerned, are tightening nerves in the dealing rooms. The opposition Social Democratic Party's leader, Mr Svend Auken, is being challenged for the leadership by his deputy, Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen. If Nyrup wins, the party will have a better chance of winning the support of the small centre parties in the eight-party Folketing and thus of an eventual return to power. The referendum on the Maastricht treaty takes place on June 2. Recent opinion polls have shown majorities against approving the treaty. A 'No' vote would have serious consequences for Denmark's future position in Europe. In September, the report of a commission of inquiry into a political scandal concerning Tamil refugees will be published. It may conclude that Mr Poul Schluter, the prime minister since 1982, misled parliament, in which case he could resign. This might result in a change of government, either with or without a general election first. Politics aside, Danish economic performance is satisfactory from a bond investor's point of view. Denmark is one of only two or three countries which currently meet all the so-called convergence criteria required of potential members of the EMU, including low inflation, stable exchange rates, interest rates in line with those of leading countries, and a manageable budget deficit. The budget deficit, however, is big enough to make the market in government bonds interesting. State net borrowing increased by DKr27bn in 1991, and the figure will not be much different in 1992.</p>

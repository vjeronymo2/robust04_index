			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets: Mexico MEXICO'S stock market ended 2 per cent weaker yesterday, dragged down by a 4.1 per cent drop in Cemex 'B' shares and a decline of 2 per cent for Telmex, the respective cement and telephone companies. Cemex CPO shares - those held in a special trust for foreign investors - were down 10 per cent at one point, as Morgan Stanley, previously a staunch Cemex supporter, failed to endorse the company in a report. Foreign investors have reacted negatively to Cemex's recent decision to buy Spain's two largest cement companies, Sanson and Valenciana.</p>

			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Suleiman Franjieh, feudal warlord who became president of Lebanon: Obituary SULEIMAN Franjieh, the former president of Lebanon and one of the country's last surviving zaim, or feudal clan leaders, has died of heart failure at the age of 82. As head of state from 1970 until 1976, Franjieh presided over the beginning of Lebanon's civil war in April 1975. The following year, he asked his old friend, President Hafez Al-Assad of Syria, to send 'peace-keeping' troops to Lebanon. To the dismay of many of Franjieh's fellow Maronite Catholics, some 40,000 Syrian soldiers remain in Lebanon to this day. Their scheduled withdrawal to eastern Lebanon this autumn is now the country's main focus of political tension. In 1957, Suleiman Franjieh led a murder squad into a church in northern Lebanon to gun down members of the rival Douaihy clan. Franjieh fled to Damascus where he forged a life-long friendship with Mr Assad, at that time an air force officer. A longtime foe of an armed Palestinian presence in Lebanon, Franjieh sent tanks and aircraft to bombard Palestinian camps near Beirut in 1973. Despite his violent past, Franjieh was respected as a senior statesman in the Middle East. Unlike many other Maronite leaders, he always stressed the importance of Lebanon's Arab identity and good relations with Syria. He held court at two homes in the northern Lebanese cities of Zghorta and Ehden, smoking cigarettes through a black holder and recalling the details of his long life with surprising lucidity. When he entered hospital in Beirut recently with heart trouble, his bodyguards occupied a whole floor of the American University Hospital while the Lebanese president, prime minister, speaker of the assembly and a host of parliamentarians called to pay their respects. The life of the 'Lion of Ehden' was repeatedly marred by violence. He had groomed his son, Tony, for leadership of the powerful northern Lebanese family. Tony Franjieh had established the Marada (Giants) militia. But in 1978, the leader of the rival Maronite Phalangist militia, Bashir Gemayel, dispatched gunmen to the family's home in Ehden to massacre Tony Franjieh, his wife, infant daughter and 30 family retainers. Suleiman Franjieh harboured untold bitterness towards the Gemayels and the Phalange. But in recent years he channelled his hopes and energies into preparing his grandson Suleiman - Tony's son - to continue the family's political role in Lebanon. Young Suleiman served as a minister without portfolio in the last two Lebanese governments, but resigned in anger last month when Samir Geagea, the Phalange leader who is believed to have carried out the 1978 Ehden massacre, arrived at a luncheon given by the Lebanese president Elias Hrawi.</p>

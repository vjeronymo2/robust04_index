			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Markets: The little guys get their selling in first - Wall Street IGNORING the good economic news (low inflation, rising retail sales and industrial output) and the bad corporate news (Olympia &amp; York's bankruptcy), the stock market pursued its own, primarily technical, agenda this week. Typical of the mood on Wall Street was its reaction to Monday's record-setting gains, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached an all-time high of 3,397.58. As soon as the new peak was reached, analysts and traders warned not to expect much more from a market that had stumbled, not bounded, the last few steps to the top. Trading volume on the Monday was light at 155m shares, an indication that enthusiasm for stocks may be waning. The fact that once again the broader market indices, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 and the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks, failed to match the Dow's achievements was another bad omen. The Dow has outperformed because investors have been increasingly choosy about where they put their money, and with many still uncertain about the short-term outlook for interest rates and the economy, the buyers have tended to seek out quality stocks such as General Electric, Wal-Mart, GTE and IBM. Analysts say a typical sign of the end of a short-term upward trend is when familiar names post gains but no-one else does, a result of investors topping up their portfolios with blue-chips and staying away from much of the rest. The sight of the Dow near 3,400 has made the market take stock of itself. It begs an obvious question: should the market be up at these heights? The answer, judging by this week's trading, is probably not. Sure, the recovery is under way, but everyone now knows that because of structural problems in the economy, mostly to do with debt, the rebound will be slower than it would normally be coming out of a recession. Also, the market may not get any more help from the Federal Reserve. Hopes of another interest rate cut had risen steadily coming into this week, primarily in expectation that if money supply growth continued to falter the Fed would be forced to step in with some extra monetary stimulus. Thursday's money numbers, however, dented those hopes. The money measure the Fed tracks most closely, M2 (currency and most interest-bearing accounts), showed an increase of Dollars 9.8bn during the first week of May, a sharp reversal of previous declines. Crucially, the latest rise took M2 growth back above the low end of the Fed's target range of 2.5 per cent to 6.5 per cent. Nice round numbers like 3,400 on the Dow also make investors nervous because they invoke fears that the big funds may have programmed their computers to sell when the index breaks through what is inevitably termed a new 'psychologically important level'. When smaller investors worry about the big boys selling, they often try get their retaliation in first. This was certainly the pattern after Monday. Every time the Dow inched near 3,400, selling kicked in as profit-takers rushed to book some of their recent profits. Once the feeling that some sort of short-term 'correction' has taken hold, as appears to have happened this week, it can be difficult to dislodge. Even favourable economic figures failed to shift the sellers. The week's inflation numbers were reassuring, with both consumer and producer prices rising just 0.2 per cent in April. If the Fed really does want to ease monetary policy again, the inflation figures have provided plenty of room for manoeuvre. Signs of life in personal spending were also evident in a 0.9 per cent increase in last month's retail sales, while April industrial production rose a solid 0.5 per cent, the third consecutive monthly improvement in output. On the corporate front, the news that Olympia &amp; York, the world's largest property developer, had filed for protection from its creditors under Canadian and US insolvency laws ensured the market ended the week on a sour note. Although O &amp; Y's descent into bankruptcy was not unexpected, it underscored the problems facing north America's commercial property market and those US and Canadian banks which lent vast sums to fund property expansion in the 1980s. Monday     3397.58 + 28.17 Tuesday    3385.12 - 12.46 Wednesday  3391.98 +  6.86 Thursday   3368.88 - 23.10 Friday</p>

			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / International Company News: UK paper war hits Hollinger The Daily Telegraph's decision to join the UK newspaper price war last spring has taken a toll on the third-quarter earnings of Hollinger, the Canadian holding company controlled by Mr Conrad Black, the Telegraph's proprietor. Hollinger's net earnings dipped to CDollars 4.6m (Dollars 3.4bn), or five cents a share, from CDollars 6.8m, or nine cents, in spite of a 47 per cent jump in revenues. The latest figures include a foreign currency loss of CDollars 2.6m, against a CDollars 7.7m gain last year, due mainly to fluctuations in the value of cash deposits held in sterling. The increase in revenues, to CDollars 313.9m from CDollars 213.7m, mainly reflects the acquisition of the Chicago Sun-Times earlier this year as Mr Black's North American flagship paper. Hollinger has a 57 per cent stake in the Telegraph, which earlier reported a fall in third-quarter earnings to Pounds 2.6m (USDollars 4.26m) from Pounds 8.1m. Third-quarter income before unusual items, taxes, minority interest and foreign exchange adjustments, totalled CDollars 30.5m, up from CDollars 21.6m. Equity earnings, mainly from Australia's John Fairfax Holdings, which is 25 per cent-owned by the Telegraph, rose Dollars 15.3m.</p>

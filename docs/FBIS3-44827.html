			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Wei Ling: Hard Currency Trading Remains Sluggish] </F>   [Text] Trading in foreign exchange swap markets across  China was flat last week, the first after the unification of the  dual-track foreign exchange system.    There was little fluctuation in prices and transactions were  small.    Experts say suppliers and buyers are becoming more prudent  and adopting a wait-and-see attitude to the market.    However, they said the cautious response at least helped  diminish decision-makers' worries about big ups and downs in  exchange rates after unification.    And although the swap markets are to be gradually phased out  with the establishment of the inter-bank exchange market, their  prices are still important references for the central bank to  set basic exchange rates.    In addition, since foreign exchange trading between banks  and  enterprises is just beginning, the swap markets are now the main  regulators of money supply between banks.    The only traders on the markets now are specialized banks  and  some non-banking financial institutions. This is because  businesses which used to trade on the market have had to  withdraw.    The U.S. dollar opened at 8.7 yuan on Monday at the Beijing  Foreign Exchange Swap market and closed at 8.7060 yuan on  Thursday [6 January].    The week's lowest price for U.S. dollars was 8.61 yuan in  Henan Foreign Exchange Swap Market on Monday and the highest was  8.725 yuan on Friday in Tianjin.    The Hong Kong dollar opened 1.125 yuan in Hainan and 1.118  yuan in Shenzhen on Monday and closed 1.125 and 1.121 yuan  respectively on Friday.</p>

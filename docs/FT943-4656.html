			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Albania jails Greek 'spies' Five ethnic Greeks were yesterday found guilty by an Albanian court of spying for Greece and illegal possession of arms after a highly charged trial that has raised tensions between Albania and Greece. The five men are all leading members of Omonia, an Albanian political movement which campaigns for the rights of the country's ethnic minority with close co-operation and funds from Greece. They were convicted of collaboration with the Greek intelligence service and encouraging secessionist activities among the Greek minority in southern Albania. Greece tried unsuccessfully to block the trial, claiming it was politically motivated and aimed at discrediting Greek links with the minority. Since the case began on August 15, Greece has expelled more than 40,000 illegal Albanian immigrants and blocked European Union aid to Albania worth Ecu35m (Pounds 27.5m) to try to stop the trial. Before the verdict was announced a defence ministry spokesman in Athens said military patrols along the border had been stepped up to prevent the expelled Albanians returning. The Greek embassy in Tirana said the verdict was 'a joke. No-one proved anything and the verdict was simply a reading of the indictment'.</p>

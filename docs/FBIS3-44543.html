At present, the production and sale of gold in China is  subject to control by the People's Bank of China, the central  bank in the country and its import and export are limited by  state control. In order to meet the needs of the market  economy, the state will consider the establishment of  specialized gold markets in which designated enterprises will be  allowed to engage in gold trading in line with the needs of  their production and the state will no longer offer gold  materials for production purposes to such enterprises, gradually  opening the gold market to the outside world and allowing gold  to be traded in a free way.    After a price adjustment for the buying and selling of gold,  the state will abolish its favourable policies for the gold  industry including policy-based subsidies, low interest loans  and the exemption of tax. Under current circumstances, however,  it is not suitable for the market for gold production and sales  to be opened to foreign businessmen and the imports and exports  of gold will remain under the mandatory control by the central  bank.</p>

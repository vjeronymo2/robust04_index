			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Company News (This Week): Yorkshire Water - Other companies As the third of the big 10 water companies to report finals this year, Yorkshire is expected to show an advance from Pounds 137m to about Pounds 144m on Thursday. However, profits are likely to be depressed by a Pounds 10m restructuring charge, largely to cover cost-cutting in the utility business. The dividend is forecast at 22p-23p, against 21.25p.</p>

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Bells ring for prophets of information age: Martin Dickson reports on the merger of Bell Atlantic with TCI Two prophets of the coming age of interactive multi-media communications joined forces yesterday to exploit an information revolution which promises to transform America - and eventually the world. Bell Atlantic, the 'Baby Bell' regional telephone company which serves the middle Atlantic seaboard of the US, announced plans for an agreed takeover of Tele-Communications Inc, the largest cable TV company in the US, serving more than 20 per cent of America's cable homes. Bell Atlantic, led by Mr Raymond Smith, 55, has been the most active of the seven 'Baby Bell' local phone companies in preparing for an interactive multi-media world. TCI's 52-year-old head Mr John Malone - who will become vice-chairman of the enlarged Bell Atlantic - is also a tireless proponent of this brave new world. The pair's shared vision of the future played a key role in prompting the deal. Both described it as the 'perfect information age marriage'. If it survives regulatory scrutiny, the deal will be the most far-reaching in a series of link-ups between US cable television and telephone companies since the start of the year. Over the next few years, households will be able to call up on a television set a vast array of information and entertainment, together with video telephone calls - although it remains uncertain how much consumers are ready to pay for this. Both the telephone and cable television industries have wires running into most US homes. The convergence of the two sectors at one time looked like provoking a furious battle, but instead the two are getting together. They have realised that each brings complementary skills to the extremely costly task of supplying the new technology to the consumer. The local telephone companies have much deeper pockets than the cable companies, as well as skills in switching complex two-way traffic. The TV companies' co-axial cable offers a much broader conduit to the home than telephone copper wires; and the cable companies have skills in distributing programmes which the telephone companies lack. Until now, the biggest link-up between the two industries was an agreement whereby US West, the Baby Bell telephone company serving the Rocky Mountains and Northwest, paid Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.65bn) for a 25 per cent stake in the entertainment production and cable arm of Time Warner, the country's second largest cable service provider. Yesterday's deal carries the trend to its logical conclusion with a proposal for a full-scale merger. It seems certain to provoke a rash of imitations as other telephone and cable companies scramble to position themselves for the new age. However, the merger between Bell Atlantic, whose turnover of around Dollars 13bn makes it the third largest Baby Bell, and TCI should give these two companies a powerful position in setting technical standards and gaining market share. This is partly because it is the first full merger, involving such large players, and partly because of the energy of the two companies and the men who run them. The Baby Bell companies - spun off from long-distance carrier American Telephone and Telegraph in 1984 under a court-ordered anti-trust settlement  -have tended to inherit the culture of monopolistic utilities. Under Mr Smith, Bell Atlantic has tried particularly hard to become more entrepreneurial, and has emerged as the most aggressive Baby Bell in trying to enter the multi-media industry. In August, it became the first US telephone company allowed to offer video services in its own telephone service area, when it successfully challenged a section of the 1984 cable television act which prevented this. It is also one of the largest players in the US cellular telephone industry, cementing its position two years ago with the Dollars 1.6bn acquisition of the Metro Mobile service. Earlier this week it moved into the Mexican market, paying Dollars 1bn for 42 per cent of carrier Grupo Iusacell. As for TCI, in 20 years Mr John Malone has transformed it from a rag-tag mix of small, poorly capitalised cable operations into an industry leader. It announced plans last week to re-merge with Liberty Media, a large cable programming company which it spun off in 1991 because of regulatory concerns. Liberty in turn owns a large stake in QVC Network, a home shopping channel which is making a hostile Dollars 9.5bn bid for entertainment group Paramount Communications - in competition with an agreed Dollars 7.5bn deal from rival cable group Viacom. All these factors mean that yesterday's deal will come under intense regulatory scrutiny. Bell Atlantic, which is not allowed to own cable systems in its own area, will spin off TCI's overlapping cable operations into a separate company. But its acquisition of TCI's and Liberty's programming interests is subject to review by the courts, and Congress will also be keenly interested in a deal which could set the model for US local phone companies of the future.

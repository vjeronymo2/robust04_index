			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / London accused on Yugoslav sanctions British Labour party yesterday stepped up its charges that the government had been slow off the mark in applying the United Nations trade embargo to Serbia, using new figures on the extent of bilateral trade with Yugoslavia, writes David Owen in London. Referring to Customs and Excise statistics for June, the first month after the UN resolution calling for a trade embargo, Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said that trade in a third of all types of goods had increased in comparison with June 1991. Examples of goods in which trade had increased included imports of iron and steel and exports of telecommunications equipment, Mr Cook said. 'It is extraordinary that the government still cannot produce figures to show how much of this trade was with Serbia,' he added. European Community officials yesterday did not endorse a plan put forward last week by the European Commission to make EC exports to Serbia and Montenegro subject to a triple licensing system, David Gardner adds from Brussels. The Brussels proposal may, however, go into a broader package designed to reinforce sanctions against the two former Yugoslav republics, UK presidency officials said.</p>

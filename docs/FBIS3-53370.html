			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] We greet you and are pleased to host Mr.  'Abd-al-Rahim Muhammad Husayn, the interior minister in  fraternal Sudan, who is currently visiting the Great Jamahiriyah.    [Husayn] [passage omitted] There is a clear colonialist  (?campaign). Five out of the seven states which have been listed  as terrorist countries, and are on America's terrorism list, are  Arab and Islamic states. And this for no reason other than  these states have independent decisions and that these states  want to develop and live in pride.    The issue is clear; they [as heard] now admit that the  accusations on the basis of which this unjust blockade was  imposed on the Great Jamahiriyah (?are groundless). They cast  doubts on these accusations and all these have now collapsed.  Despite this, the blockade continues. [passage omitted]    Why was Sudan put on the list of terrorist states? No  incident has been proved and no terrorist action has been  launched from Sudan, and Sudan has not experienced terrorism  throughout its life. We have never heard of a Sudanese citizen  participating in any terrorist operation. This is something  which does not exist in the character and structure of the  people of Sudan. When they said that they put us on the list of  terrorist states, the Americans said that there were accusations  by reliable sources. We told them [word indistinct] and we do  not want these sources to be disclosed. We told them: We do not  want you to disclose these sources, but to prove to us these  facts. They have not been able to prove a single fact. Despite  this Sudan was put on the list of terrorist states.    Former American President Carter denied this, because he  visited Sudan [word indistinct] to announce that these  accusations were unjustified. This is what was said by a former  American president.    The issue is not about proved facts, but the whole matter is  that any voice which is raised in the Arab nation to declare the  pride of this nation must be silenced, and anyone raising this  voice must have a blockade imposed on him and must be  humiliated. This is the issue. [passage omitted]    We reject injustice, this unjust blockade, and this list on  which they put whoever they want without any evidence, and we  reject the use of international organizations and meetings for  personal goals. The United Nations has double standards and uses  rules and means with which people are humiliated. [passage  omitted]</p>

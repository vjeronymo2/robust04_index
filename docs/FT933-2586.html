			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / International Company News: Profits at Union Miniere decline 46% UNION Miniere, the Belgian metals group, yesterday forecast a difficult second half after announcing a 46 per cent fall in operating profits for the first six months of 1993. Consolidated operating profits fell to BFr478m (Dollars 14m) from BFr894m for the six-month period, but the group said it was pleased to have recorded a positive result in spite of 'an extremely unfavourable economic environment'. The company attributed its resilience to costly rationalisation measures taken over the last two years, but a spokesman warned that operating results in the second half would be even worse than in the first six months. The group managed to reduce its share of losses after tax to BFr860m, compared with a loss of BFr1.39bn in the first half of last year, when the results were dragged down by extraordinary restructuring charges of BFr1.49bn. In the first half of 1993, the extraordinary loss was BFr243m, including the BFr176m cost of nearly 600 redundancies. The same number of jobs is likely to be cut from the company's 13,400 workforce in the second half. Societe Generale de Belgique, Belgium's largest holding company, owns 75 per cent of Union Miniere, an investment which represents about 20.5 per cent of the holding company's portfolio. La Generale said yesterday that it was still seeking an industrial partner for Union Miniere to help reduce the holding company's exposure to the cyclical industrial sector.</p>

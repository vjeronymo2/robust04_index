			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Travel: An aristocrat in the Outback - Nicholas Woodsworth fends off the crocs in an Englishman's luxury resort in Australia WHEN Will Burrell told me the evening I arrived at El Questro that he was having a spot of trouble with a salty in the gorge, and would I like to throw a muffin at it, I hoped my face did not show total incomprehension. I said I would be delighted to. Leading me outside the living room to a wide wooden veranda, he placed a muffin in my hand and told me to let fly. Down in a wide arc it sailed until some 40ft below the house it landed with a splash. In the glare of spotlights illuminating the gorge over which the El Questro homestead sits precariously cantilevered, I watched a horde of small bream throw themselves on the muffin. Abruptly they scattered. An impossibly large, dark form rose through the murky water, rippled its surface, and, like the muffin, vanished. 'Salt-water crocodile,' murmured Will. 'About 15ft. Sometimes they come up-river from the mudflats on the Cambridge gulf. They are killers, absolutely vicious. He would be much happier to eat you than a bit of bread.' He turned to Celia, his muffin supplier and wife-to-be. 'Do remind me, darling,' he said, 'to phone the croc-catcher on Monday.' Will Burrell is probably the last person you would expect to find running a 1m-acre cattle station and luxury resort in the middle of nowhere. A tall, languid Englishman with fair hair and public school manners, there is something of the tearaway about him. He might more properly be found in various London haunts than here in the Kimberley, one of the wildest and most isolated regions of northern Australia. Equally, there is something of the old-fashioned gentleman-adventurer about this 26-year-old. Will's great-grandfather, Lord Thomas Denham, went to Australia as its governor-general and started a tradition. Succeeding generations have also travelled out as young men for stints Down Under. Will has thrown himself into the deep end. Two years ago he was wearing a grey suit and working as a City of London financial management consultant. His purchase of El Questro in a near-derelict state has changed his priorities. Today you are more likely to find him in dirty work-shirt and chasing cows on the back of a trail-bike. He and Celia, daughter of a Melbourne business family, are now more concerned with beef markets than financial ones - he is working to build-up a herd of 3,000 cattle - and have opened what is probably the most luxurious outback resort in Australia. They are also having a good deal of fun. I enjoyed doing what most guests at El Questro do. Ninety minutes' flight from the coastal city of Darwin and an hour's four-wheel-drive from the nearest shops or settlement, the homestead sits in splendid isolation in the midst of vast, spectacular and unpopulated hill country. There is an end-of-the-earth feeling about the place which makes the vivid contrast between opulent living and wild surroundings all the more remarkable. Salties or no salties, I puttered down the Chamberlain gorge in a small boat, past high red cliffs, odd tropical plants and sulphur-crested cockatoos, to gaze at Aboriginal rock paintings; they are as mysterious as messages from space. Surrounded by lush panadus palms and with a cold drink in hand, I lay in the natural rock pool of the Zebedee hot springs, sighed deeply, and felt sorry for people with whirlpool baths. At the station paddocks five miles down the road from the homestead, I watched in consternation as the wives and young children of stockmen, mounted and thundering through the dust at impossible speed, tore about after heifers at an impromptu rodeo. Outbackers are as tough as any cowboys in the American west. Miraculously, all survived, but I declined an invitation to break my own neck. These thrills palled, though, when one morning a helicopter flew in and settled gently on the manicured lawns of the homestead. As fond as he is of working with horses and cattle, Will has an almost overpowering addiction to playing with bait and fishing rods. It is something his wife will have to watch in the future. But what red-blooded gentleman-adventurer could resist fishing El Questro-style, which means jumping into a helicopter, flying to some river canyon or estuary and fishing for the great barramundi, Australia's premier sports fish. I am not inexperienced in matters of aerial transport. I have flown in crippled Russian Tupelovs, scared myself silly with hung-over Cessna pilots in the Sahara and jumped from Swiss mountains in nylon para-gliders. But none of these experiences matches the fun of flying low over the red rock ridges of the Australian outback in a perspex bubble with the doors removed. From up above one gets an idea of the emptiness and ruggedness of the Kimberley, and the temerity of the people who have settled it. This is not a country for the faint-at-heart. Here we were just 15` off the equator and a short hop from the southern islands of Indonesia. In 'winter' the land can turn tinder-dry and die of prolonged drought; in the 'Wet', the monsoon season, temperatures rise to 40`C, the air becomes saturated with moisture, and heavy rainfall cuts roads for weeks at a time. Heat, humidity, isolation and hard outdoor work breed a special type here. The people who live and work in Australia's Top End - truck drivers and miners, croc-catchers and buffalo hunters, cattlemen and helicopter musterers - are as tough as the land around them. But they are also dreamers: visionaries sustained by the belief that one day their hard work will bring prosperity to the area. Will Burrell is no different. As we flew over the green ribbon of the Pentecost river we could follow its twisting course northward through sparsely-covered bush to the Cambridge gulf and the tropical waters of the Timor sea. Up on the gulf, amid miles of mudflats and mangrove swamps, lies the tiny port of Wyndham, a sleep-stunned settlement that once lived on the hopes of gold mining. Today it dreams of a future as a port for new Australian exports to Asia. In his mind's eye Will sees thousands of bellowing El Questro cattle being loaded live at Wyndham for shipment to the cities of Malaysia and Indonesia. For now, though, there were barramundi to catch. With only inches of space free for its whirling rotors, the helicopter put down on a rocky shelf beside the Durack river. First there was a matter of bait, the barramundi's favourite being the pop-eyed mullet that swarm in the brackish shallows along the mudflats. We caught a few pop-eyes, but Amanda, a member of our party, had a truly surprising catch. No sooner had she cast her line into midstream than a great black and white fish eagle dropped out of the sky, firmly embedded the hook in its talons, and rose into the air. It took some skill to play the bird down to earth and free it. As the afternoon wore on we all caught bream and catfish, but in the end it was Amanda, again, a city dweller from Melbourne, who proved the best outback fisher. A hard strike, a long struggle, a quick tail-dance on the surface of the river and minutes later a prehistoric-looking barramundi was roasting over our river-side fire. One of these days, Will told me later that evening as the campfire burned low and we put in some punishing work on a bottle of Bundaberg over-proof rum, he and Celia will move back to England. One cannot avoid ancestral duties and the more conventional life forever. But he did not seem too sad. Life might be tamer in Mayfair and the green hills of Surrey, but El Questro will always be there to return to. No matter what the dreamers and visionaries come up with, they will never entirely tame the outback. Nicholas Woodsworth travelled to Australia with British Airways (tel: 081-897-4000).

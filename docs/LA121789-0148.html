			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> READ ALL ABOUT IT;  </P> <P> FROM ONCE-OBSCURE ASIAN CUISINES TO CLASSIC FRENCH TO THE LASTEST GRAIN CRAZE,  THE VARIETY OF COOKBOOKS AVAILABLE FOR GIFT GIVING SWELLS AS CHRISTMAS  APPROACHES. TO HELP CULL THE BEST FROM THE REST, THE TIMES' FOOD STAFF HAS  REVIEWED THE YEAR'S MOST INTRIGUING COOKBOOKS.;  </P> <P> THE FOODS OF VIETNAM BY NICOLE ROUTHIER (STEWART, TABORI &amp; CHANG: $35, 240  PAGES, ILLUSTRATED).  </P> <P> Not much information on Vietnamese cooking has been published, so those who  have become acquainted with this light, vegetable-laden cuisine in restaurants  should find this book interesting. The recipes cover many of the dishes  commonly seen in Vietnamese eating places, among them pho bac, which is a north  Vietnamese beef-noodle soup; cha gio (spring rolls), curry-flavored beef stew,  grilled beef with lemon grass, charcoal broiled pork and, for dessert, fried  bananas.  </P> <P> This is a luxury book in the Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang tradition, with  expertly styled photographs. Handsome, expensive cookbooks are common now, but  at least this one supplies information that is not easy to find elsewhere.  Saigon-born Routhier, who is half French and half Vietnamese, lives in New  York. BARBARA HANSEN  </P></p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / O&amp;Y set to sell stake in Santa Fe OLYMPIA &amp; YORK, the troubled property developer, yesterday unveiled plans to alleviate its cash shortage by selling its 18 per cent stake in Santa Fe Pacific, the Chicago-based railway, mining and pipeline group, for an estimated Dollars 400m (Pounds 225m). O&amp;Y announced its plans for a public offering of Sante Fe shares while 11 banks were meeting in London to decide whether to put the company's UK subsidiary, O&amp;Y Canary Wharf Holdings, into administration under British insolvency procedures. The alternative to administration is a proposal, backed by the UK banks Lloyds and Barclays, for the banks to lend Pounds 30m to allow work to continue over the coming month at O&amp;Y's property development at Canary Wharf in London's Docklands. Banks could not agree on the way forward but set themselves a deadline of Thursday to resolve the matter. A banker said 'a couple of banks are still refusing to support the proposal to put in new money'. Separately, O&amp;Y said it had called a meeting for Thursday with representatives of its 15 largest creditor banks to outline long-term plans to restructure its Dollars 12bn debt. At this meeting, to be held in London, O&amp;Y will for the first time present a five-year business plan. The Santa Fe deal, which is likely to raise about Dollars 400m, is meant as a signal to O&amp;Y's banks that it is willing to make some sacrifices in its debt restructuring by selling assets. O&amp;Y also disclosed that it has withdrawn plans for four real estate financings this year totalling USDollars 1.4bn. As a result, the company said it would not pay interest totalling CDollars 17m on publicly traded bonds secured by First Canadian Place, its 72-storey flagship building in downtown Toronto. The interest payments were due on Monday. Trust indentures on several of the North American buildings, including First Canadian Place, require O&amp;Y to reserve rental income for running expenses and debt-service payments. The company said it was preparing proposals for the First Canadian Place bondholders which 'it hopes will be satisfactory' to them and to their trustee. O&amp;Y has also failed to make a smaller interest payment due on floating rates notes secured by three Manhattan office buildings. A Dollars 6m payment on these notes was made in April, several weeks after O&amp;Y's liquidity crisis first surfaced. O&amp;Y built up its stake in the original Santa Fe Pacific from mid-1987 when it sought to diversify its real estate business. Santa Fe has since been split into three public companies. O&amp;Y still has substantial minority interests in the two other groups: Catellus Development, a west coast housing developer; and Santa Fe Energy, an oil and gas producer. Meanwhile, O&amp;Y's failure to pay interest on its publicly traded bonds is certain to complicate its debt-restructuring efforts.</p>

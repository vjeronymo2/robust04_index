			<p>Association   Wants `Buy European' Policy   <F P=102> BR2705155394 Paris LE FIGARO (LE FIG-ECO Supplement) in  French 27 May 94 p IV </F>  <F P=103> BR2705155394 </F> <F P=104>  Paris LE FIGARO (LE FIG-ECO Supplement) </F> <F P=105>  French </F> BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "A.R.": "French Aircraft Manufacturers Want </F> `European Preference'"]    [Text] The GIFAS [French Aerospace Industries Accociation]  is happy with the Military Programming Law. But it wants Europe  to start buying European rather than American.    The 1995-2000 Military Programming Law "restores our  confidence," said Serge Dassault, CEO of Dassault Industries and  GIFAS president. "France is demonstrating its determination to  preserve its armament industry."    Nevertheless, the law also worries the aerospace sector,  whose revenues (120.2 billion francs) dropped by 8.5 percent  last year. Since the Military Programming Law favors ongoing  programs, it potentially threatens research, where spending may  fall by as much as 10 percent. "If we want to be able to  develop new products within 10 years, now is the time to launch  preparatory studies," argues Serge Dassault, who fears that  "research teams and know-how may become scattered." Should this  happen, firms will find it harder to remain competitive. And  one government objective is precisely to boost competitiveness  within the coming five years. However, this requires that firms  be given some maneuvering room as far as jobs are concerned,  Serge Dassault claims: "The government cannot ask us to avoid  layoffs and to improve productivity at the same time."    While he would like to see France adopt "an procurement  system that would cover several years" instead of the current  budgetary one, Serge Dassault wants above all to be able to  compete with the Americans on two markets: the export market,  and Europe.    With regard to the export market, he requests increased  government support, matching that provided by Washington or the  Eximbank. As for Europe, he would like it to at least buy  European at last. In the middle of the European election  campaign, "we do not hear anything said about European defense  or European preference," he notes sar. "Every time a government  chooses to buy American, it is Europe that suffers."  <H5>  Repealing the `Buy American Act' </H5>   For Serge Dassault, this is all the more important since on  their home market the Americans are protected by the "Buy  American Act." On the other hand, "every time a need emerges in  Europe, the Americans show up. This is completely wrong."  However, Mr. Dassault can only admit that manufacturers have no  real power on this issue. Decisions "are up to the  governments." And the interests of governments are not the same  depending on whether they have or they do not have a domestic  aircraft industry.    This is why, for lack of a better solution, Dassault Vice  President Charles Edelstenne, who maintains that "80 percent of  combat aircraft in Europe are American ones," bluntly demand  that the Buy American Act be repealed. Of course, anyone aware  of just how fiercely the Americans have been protecting their  aerospace industry will know that this has to be a purely formal  demand.    But it is also a way of setting the record straight,  because,  as Francois David, Aerospatiale deputy manager and GIFAS vice  president, pointed out: "While the Americans do not speak about  American preference, they do enforce it; whereas while we talk  about European preference, we do not enforce it."  possible to guarantee 50,000 jobs over 25 years.</p>

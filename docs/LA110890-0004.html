			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAGAN STATE BUILDING  </P> <P> I can't believe it! "State Dedicates Reagan Office Building," I read.  </P> <P> A President who exited office leaving an ungodly mess: a trillion-dollar-plus  national deficit, the savings and loan $500-billion-plus disaster, Irangate; a  man who threw hundreds of thousands of mentally ill into the streets virtually  single-handedly, who rewarded ultra-rich individuals and corporations with  generous "trickle-down" tax breaks that caused the record-breaking deficit,  etc.  </P> <P> I challenge anyone to name a single thing Reagan did while in office that  benefited anyone but the rich and the powerful. Trickle down indeed! Surely the  gods must be shaking their heads sadly at these misguided stupid mortals who  reward misgovernment.  </P> <P> SHIRLEY WOLF  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

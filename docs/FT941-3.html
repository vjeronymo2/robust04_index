			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / International Company News: BSN to take control of NZ foods producer BSN, France's largest food manufacturer, is to set to take control of Best Foods, the New Zealand company in which it already holds a 20 per cent stake. BSN said yesterday it had launched an agreed bid for Best at NZDollars 4 per share, valuing the company at about FFr450m (USDollars 78.9m). Under the terms of the agreement, the Huljich family, which controls 50.01 per cent of Best, will buy back up to 33 per cent of the shares in the company. BSN, which would hold 67 per cent of the shares in Best, said the aim was to withdraw the company from the New Zealand stock market. Best, which produces frozen prepared foods under the 'Top Hat' brand, achieved sales last year of FFr180m and net profits estimated at about 10 per cent of that figure. According to BSN, the company has a strong potential to export to the Australian, Japanese and US markets. The acquisition is in line with BSN's strategy of expanding in the Asia-Pacific region. Its sales in the region have risen from about FFr500m in 1989 to some FFr3.5bn last year.</p>

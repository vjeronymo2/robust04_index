			<p><P> December 24, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL NATIONAL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MURDOCK (45) CAN'T BEAT ARIZONA BY HIMSELF  </P> <P> It took a balanced performance by fourth-ranked Arizona to offset the one-man  show that Providence's Eric Murdock put on Sunday in Tucson.  </P> <P> Despite a McKale Center-record 45 points by Murdock, the Wildcats pulled out a  99-87 victory to go to 8-1 for the season and extend their nation-leading home  winning streak to 52 games. Providence is 7-2.  </P> <P> Providence Coach Rick Barnes said the game made two things obvious.  </P> <P> "One of them," he said, "is that Arizona's basketball team is certainly one of  the best teams in the country. Another is that Eric Murdock proved why he's one  of the best players in the country.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't trade him for any player in the country. He was the one guy who  thought we could win this game."  </P> <P> Arizona Coach Lute Olson called Murdock "as good a guard as I've seen since  I've been out here. What's significant about him is that he plays well at both  ends of the court. He's constantly a threat on defense. Even when we thought we  had good pressure on him, he still was able to knock them down."  </P> <P> Murdock, a 6-foot-2 senior guard, scored 19 points in the final 9:45. He pulled  the smaller Friars within 88-81 with 2:19 left on a jump shot for his 44th  point. It came during a 10-0 Providence run that cut Arizona's lead to 88-85.  </P> <P> With 1:06 left, he made one of two free throws to cut the deficit to 89-86.  </P> <P> But with 36 seconds left and Providence trailing 93-87, Murdock dribbled the  ball off his foot.  </P> <P> Chris Mills finished with 28 points for Arizona, Matt Muehlebach had 18, Sean  Rooks 14 and Brian Williams 12.  </P> <P> Murdock broke the McKale Center record of 41 points set by Arizona's Al Fleming  in 1976 against Detroit. Murdock had four three-pointers among his 14 baskets.  </P> <P> The game was the third and last Providence would play without starting point  guard Corey Floyd and reserves Marvin Saddler and Kenny McDonald, who were  suspended by the NCAA for one game and the school for two more for their part  in a brawl against Rhode Island on Dec. 8.  </P> <P> No. 15 Connecticut 94, Fairfield 70 -- Scott Burrell scored a career-high 23  points and grabbed nine rebounds as the Huskies found their outside shooting  touch at Hartford, Conn.  </P> <P> The Huskies (6-1) played without Coach Jim Calhoun, who was hospitalized with  flu symptoms. Assistant Howie Dickenman ran the team.  </P> <P> Connecticut put the game out of reach with a 13-3 run in the second half,  capped by Chris Smith's three-pointer that made it 62-42.  </P> <P> The Huskies have had trouble from three-point range (25.4%) and the foul line  (52.5%) this season, but they improved in those areas against the Stags.  Connecticut hit six of nine from three-point range and 22 of 34 free throws.  </P> <P> </P> <P> REGIONAL HIGHLIGHTS  </P> <P> WEST  </P> <P> Stevie Wise scored 29 points, including eight in a crucial 15-4 run in the  second half, to lead Colorado (6-3) to an 89-79 nonconference victory over  Stanford (6-2) at Boulder, Colo. Colorado hit six free throws in the final 1:18  to seal the victory. Adam Keefe led Stanford with 20 points. . . . Maurice  Alexander scored 21 points and Paris Bryant added 20 to lead Wyoming (7-1) to a  98-84 victory over Sam Houston State (1-9) at Huntsville, Tex. . . . Mike  Iuczolino scored 30 points to lead St. Francis, Pa., (5-4) to an 82-71 victory  over Virginia Commonwealth (4-5) at the Chaminade Kauai Classic at Kapaa,  Hawaii. In the other game, Stan Rose and Elbert Rogers scored 17 points apiece  and Alabama-Birmingham (7-3) used a 28-0 first half run to beat Chaminade,  87-60. Chaminade is 3-6.  </P> <P> </P> <P> EAST  </P> <P> Guard Mark Haughton scored a season-high 23 points and forward Mark Murray  added 18 points to lead Delaware (2-6) to an 81-76 victory over visiting Maine  (4-5).  </P></p>

			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Arts: Today's Television Class changed The controller of BBC2, Alan Yentob, seems to have decided that the first two hours of Friday evening should be devoted to what might be called 'heritage television'. Thus the 1965 children's puppet series Stingray (6.00) is followed at 6.25 by another series from the same year, The Man From UNCLE, the United Network Command for Law Enforcement whose main agents were Napoleon Solo and Ilya Kuryakin, played by Robert Vaughn and David McCallum. At 7.15 comes an old Dr Who story starring Jon Pertwee which the BBC had junked. Luckily some fanatic somewhere had kept a monochrome recording and the BBC has now 'colourized' this so that it can be re-shown. Dr Who began in 1963, but the oldest series of the lot in this early evening blitz is What The Papers Say which began in 1956 and looks like it. If you liked 'Civvies' with its violence and sentimentality, and 'Prime Suspect' with its unusually nasty murder plot and hatred of men, and 'Widows' with its amoral attitude towards female criminals, then you may well like Framed (9.00 ITV) since all these works are by Lynda La Plante.</p>

			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / International Company News: French court rules that Exor must bid for Perrier ITALY'S Agnelli family yesterday vowed to fight to the end for control of Perrier, the celebrated French mineral water company, despite fresh complications thrown up by a Paris Appeals Court ruling. The court declared that Exor, the Perrier holding group controlled by the Agnellis and their allies, must launch a bid for Perrier itself. The water group is also facing a hostile direct bid from Nestle, the Swiss food multinational, launched last month. Depending on the outcome of Exor's talks with stock market regulators, this could increase the cost of the Agnelli approach of using Exor to gain control of Perrier, without launching a direct bid. Exor had asked for this obligation to be suspended while the court made up its mind on Exor's appeal for exemption from a ruling by the Conseil des Bourses de Valeurs (CBV) that it should bid for the water group. That decision is expected in mid-April. However, Mr Giovanni Agnelli, chairman of Fiat, said yesterday: 'We cannot give up because of this.' Speaking in Rome, he admitted frustration. 'This French affair has become long, intricate and tiresome for all,' he told Reuters news agency. But the battle could be 'lengthy and finish well,' he added. Exor and its allies have acquired 49 per cent control of Perrier, well above the 33 per cent threshold at which Exor should normally launch a two-thirds bid, under French takeover rules. The cost of buying the extra 17 per cent needed to lift the stake to 66 per cent would in theory be nearly FFr1.9bn (Dollars 341m) at the FFr1,235 per share at which Perrier last month sold a stake to Saint-Louis, the sugar company allied to the Agnellis. Nestle, the Swiss food multinational, launched a rival hostile bid for Perrier at FFr1,475 per share a few days later, but Exor lawyers argued yesterday that it could discharge its legal obligations by making an offer at the lower price. Presumably, nobody would then accept, so Exor and its allies could continue to hold their 49 per cent stake at no extra cost. Exor said it would discuss the details of when and at what price it would bid with the CBV.</p>

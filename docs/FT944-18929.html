			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Nato entry stalled for Visegrad countries The US, faced with strong Russian objections, has backed off from the idea of putting four countries - Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia  -on a fast track to full membership of Nato. The new US position emerged yesterday at an informal meeting of Nato defence ministers, where Germany's Mr Volker Ruhe received a cool response to his proposal that the four central European states, the Visegrad group, should be viewed as prime candidates for entry. Mr William Perry, the US defence secretary, said it would be 'entirely premature' to set a timetable for the expansion of Nato. Asked to sum up the discussion on new countries joining the alliance, Mr Perry said: 'We certainly haven't specified who or when, and we are not likely to in the near future.' Mr Ruhe has argued that Russia can never join the alliance, and he wants the 16 existing members to agree as soon as possible on lists of nations which definitely can, and definitely cannot, become full members. However the US administration, which received President Boris Yeltsin in Washington last week, has shied away from making rigid distinctions among its former Warsaw Pact adversaries, and this reluctance appears to have deepened in recent days. After a two-day meeting in Seville that was overshadowed by the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, Mr Perry disclosed that he was confident of more Russian help in isolating the Bosnian Serbs, and in ensuring that the border between Serbia and Bosnia was fully sealed. He said that according to the 'incomplete' reports available to Washington, Serbia had complied only partially with its obligation to sever military and commercial links with its ethnic kinsmen in Bosnia. 'We look to Russia as the government with the best communications with the Serbs, to assist in the enforcement of this,' Mr Petry said. While Mr Perry made no connection between the issues of Bosnia and Nato enlargement, his comments on both matters suggested a greater US emphasis, in the wake of last week's summit, on the idea of co-operation with Russia. Mr Perry predicted that in future any Nato air strikes in Bosnia would be carried out 'with greater speed, with surprise and with more force than in the past'. He acknowledged that Nato could not dictate to the UN grand commanders in Bosnia when to invoke the air power of the alliance. But under new procedures, he said, Nato pilots would have more freedom of action over targets and timing once they had left the ground.</p>

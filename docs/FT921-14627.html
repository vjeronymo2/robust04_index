			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / International Company News: German insurer to take 3% of Austrian bank HAMBURG-Mannheimer Versicherungs, Germany's second biggest life insurance group, plans to take a 3 per cent shareholding in one of Austria's biggest banks, Z-Laenderbank Austria, Reuter reports from Vienna. Hamburg-Mannheimer will pay around DM150m (Dollars 94m) for its stake. Germany's Allianz and Muenchener Rueckversicherungs and Sweden's Forsakrings Skandia each hold more than 25 per cent of Hamburg-Mannheimer. Hamburg-Mannheimer's stake can be viewed as a strategic, developing an existing partnership in the insurance industry.</p>

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Go-ahead for Thorp welcomed by foreign customers The government finally gave the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant the go-ahead yesterday, ending nearly a year of controversy over the project. The Pounds 2.8bn plant, which has taken nearly 10 years to build, is designed to reprocess used nuclear fuel from reactors, extracting the reusable uranium and plutonium. Japanese and German power utilities, Thorp's main foreign customers, greeted the decision with relief. Mr Kohji Kaneko, general manager of the Federation of Electric Power Companies, said: 'We're glad that the government has decided as we had hoped.' Dr Thomas Roser, chief executive of the German Atomforum, the main lobby group for the nuclear industry, said he welcomed the decision. Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, told the House of Commons that 'there is a sufficient balance of advantage in favour of the operation of Thorp'. The decision, which settles one of the thorniest questions of industrial policy facing the government, was immediately condemned by environmental groups and opposition MPs. It now faces a final threat of judicial review from Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group. In rejecting calls for a public inquiry, Mr Gummer said he was satisfied that there were 'no issues raised which would cause us to believe that further consultation or debate is necessary'. But the government told British Nuclear Fuels it would have to report each year on plans to cut radioactive emissions. Mr John Guinness, chairman of BNF, who yesterday 'warmly welcomed' the decision, said: 'No other industrial activity has undergone such detailed and wide-ranging public scrutiny over the past 16 years as Thorp. The plant has faced three parliamentary debates, two public consultations, and intense media coverage and analysis.' Mr Simon Hughes, Liberal Democrat spokesman, said: 'Giving the go-ahead to Thorp without an independent public inquiry is dangerously wrong, undemocratic and possibly illegal.'

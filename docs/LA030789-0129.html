			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> S.A. BANS STOPPING FOR PROSTITUTES  </P> <P> The Santa Ana City Council unanimously approved on Monday night a no-stopping  zone for a stretch of Harbor Boulevard to discourage men from pulling over to  hire prostitutes. The rule will be in effect from 4 p.m. to 9 a.m. from  Westminster Avenue to Warner Avenue. Violators can be fined $30. The vote also  provides about $6,000 for 80 no-stopping signs, which will be installed March  15, said Ruth Smith, an engineer with the city's Public Works Agency. The city  probably will allow a 10-day grace period after that, she said. A Superior  Court judge denied a controversial request last month by the city to declare  prostitutes a public nuisance and bar them from the boulevard.  </P></p>

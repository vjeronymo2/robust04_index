			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Eurotunnel hopes to settle costs dispute with TML EUROTUNNEL hopes to present its board with a settlement of its costs dispute with Transmanche Link, the consortium building the Channel tunnel, in February. Optimism about the prospects for a deal sent Eurotunnel shares higher in Paris and London, where Eurotunnel's units finished up 22p at 420p. A deal to settle the dispute, mainly about the costs of completing the so-called lump-sum works at the tunnel's terminals, could be presented to the Eurotunnel board in the second week of February. A senior executive close to the talks said: 'It is premature to say a deal is close. Nothing has happened over Christmas but the talks were going well and they have resumed in that spirit.' The Eurotunnel board is likely to be told this week a settlement will involve a trade-off between the amount Eurotunnel pays for the tunnel to be completed and the pace of the work. Originally the tunnel was to open for full services on June 15 next year. However, it seems likely this could be delayed until September because of delays in delivering railway rolling stock. TML, which brings together the 10 main contractors on the project, has told Eurotunnel it will co-operate with a revised and accelerated commissioning process as long as Eurotunnel responds positively to its claims to cover the extra costs of completing the work. If Eurotunnel does not meet TML's claims it risks losing the builders' co-operation during the key commissioning process. This could delay the tunnel's opening. TML is claiming about Pounds 1.27bn to cover the lump-sum works at 1985 prices, which Eurotunnel initially costed at about Pounds 625m. Eurotunnel has set aside an additional Pounds 450m which could be used to cover TML's claims. Some of the Pounds 200m gap between the two sides is likely to be bridged by an agreement to defer some claims until next year. The negotiating teams have agreed a procedure for settling the designs for the rest of the project to prevent changes generating further cost overruns. The schedule for completing commissioning and testing of the tunnel's operating systems has been disrupted by delays in the delivery of engines and carriages for the shuttle services to be run by Eurotunnel and those British Rail plans to run with its continental partners.

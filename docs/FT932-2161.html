			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Arts: Tofubar and cedifop - Radio TIME WAS when the BBC seriously tried to teach us to speak properly, but nowadays its staff say 'lorandorder' and 'kilOMeter' like anybody else. So don't expect that Frank Delaney's series Word of Mouth (Radio 4, Tuesdays) will be smacking our wrists. No way - it begins by teaching us Eurospeak, words like tofubar and cedifop, that derive from acronyms and are, we are assured, the slang of top people in today's Europe. Tofubar is a computer term, Things Are Fouled Up Beyond All Recognition; cedifop is from a German acronym and says European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training. These at least mean the same in every language, while common words like 'subsidiary' and 'federal' may vary with nationality. Delaney did not teach us much; next day would have given us Thorp, the Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant. Instead, he announced a competition to nominate the best spoken English, in which specimens John Betjeman and Belfast reporter Jerry Anderson seemed to me a dead heat, and to deviate among tattoo-artists, or dermographers as they are now. Another brand of quasi-English is heard in Radio 3's In a Word, where Jeremy Beadle explains such terms as expressionism, symbolism, futurism and the rest. Don't suspect he will finish the series with a crushing tape revealing our general ignorance; this is Jeremy J. Beadle, not the television comic. I did not feel he had anything new to say. Radio 3 calls last Sunday's Doctor Faustus a 'new version' by director Sue Wilson, but its novelty was mostly in the less valid inner scenes - though there was a surprising number of trivial changes in the familiar dialogue of Acts 1 and 5. I covered those Acts a week or so ago when they were done on the World Service, and need say no more now than that Stephen Moore was a fine Faustus (who correctly used the old Latin pronunciation), and Philip Voss an interesting Mephostophilis with some positively human emotions now and then. If Sue Wilson wrote as well as directed the middle bits, she was rewriting Rowley or Nashe besides Marlowe, and she did it in the same spirit. We had pop music for the Seven Deadly Sins (score by Anthea Gomez), and I think I heard an anachronistic 'Uncle Sam' from Covetousness, though the words were not easy to follow. We visited the Pope's feast and we followed the adventures of Robin with his stolen textbook and the Horse-courser with Faustus's wooden leg. I was truly alarmed by the sound made by Hell's unveiling. This is all of Marlowe until the autumn; but if he were with us this century he would probably be writing like James M. Cain, whose Double Indemnity began Radio 4's season, 'Saturday Night at the Movies' (on Saturday). This ingenious tale of murder on the railway has no hero, just a bunch of Americans concerned almost equally with adultery, money and murder. The radio version by John Fletcher had a splendidly pictorial quality, was played excitingly by Frederic Forrest, Theresa Russell, Molly Ringwald and a hard-to-recognise John Wood, and was directed by Andy Jordan. More drama on the World Service, A Shaft of Sunlight by Abhijat Joshi, that got the special award in the World Service's playwriting competition for writers with English as a second language. It began with a strong Hindu-Moslem situation, but relapsed into reminiscences. The English was more literary than dramatic. I heard Witchbroom, the current book at bedtime to test the risk of its keeping me awake. It is a magical story about Creole life on a Caribbean cocoa-plantation, enchantingly read by the author, Lawrence Scott, abridged by Margaret Bushby and directed by Marina Salandy-Brown  - all Trinidadians. I slept like a log.</p>

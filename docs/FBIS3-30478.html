			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The question of the possible intervention of  Croatian forces in the Bosnian conflict was the focus of a  meeting in Zagreb between Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana  and the Croatian prime minister. Solana ended his visit to  former Yugoslavia this afternoon. Our special correspondent  Pedro Fernandez Cespedes reports.    [Cespedes] Good evening. Croatian Prime Minister Nikica  Valentic met Minister Solana and denied the direct intervention  of regular Croatian troops in the conflict in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Spanish foreign minister was forceful  and clear when it came to asking the question in Zagreb at  midday today. Valentic gave an assurance that it is not the  case and Javier Solana spoke about a different report.    [Begin Solana recording] Whatever the case may be, the  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] forces, the UNPROFOR commanders,  say that Croatian troops have indeed been seen on the ground.  [end recording]    [Cespedes] A negotiated solution to the problem of  Srebrenica  without the need for air strikes is on the way, and hopes of a  similar -- though more distant -- outcome for the opening of  Tuzla Airport have not been ruled out. These are the two most  important pieces of information obtained by Minister Solana  following his talks with the UN secretary general's  representative for the military conflict in the former  Yugoslavia, with whom he agrees that the threats of air strikes  are bearing fruit.</p>

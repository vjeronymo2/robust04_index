			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Survey of Saudi Arabia (6): One day, the call will be answered - A special correspondent reports on plans to expand telephone lines fourfold by 1997 Over the past five years, the country's demand for telecommunications, particularly telephone lines, has exceeded all expectations. A Jeddah newspaper, in an article earlier this month, suggested that 'the average Saudi' spends more time on the telephone than his counterparts in other Arab countries. However, placing an international call at peak business hours in either Saudi Arabia or the receiving country is much more difficult today than, say, two years ago. All too often, the caller gets the recorded reply: 'We are sorry, your call did not go through; please try again later.' Bankers report long waits for new telephone lines, while many factories are said to be resorting to portables for which there is less of a wait. Saudi Telecom, the operational arm of the Posts, Telegraphs &amp; Telephones ministry, has a target of one telephone, a mobile phone and a pager for one in every five people. That would mean at least 3m of each item for a population which last year was officially estimated to be 16.9m, of whom 12.3m were Saudi nationals. The population is said to be increasing by 4 per cent or nearly 500,000 a year across the country, and possibly by 5 per cent in the cities. To reach the PTT's target, Saudi Telecom's strategy is to expand telephone lines nearly fourfold by 1997. Part of the reason for this surge in demand is that domestic telephone charges are heavily subsidised. While international calls are more expensive than in the US or Europe, domestic calls are part of the government's welfare state benefits to add to a list that includes schooling, medicine, domestic flights, power, water and some parts of agriculture. Free dialling within a province was introduced in April 1992 - at the same time as electricity and water charges were cut for consumers - and the cost of other telephone calls went down by 40 per cent. Saudi Telecom is, however, a cash cow. It would make an attractive proposition for privatisation were it not for the government's concern over control and monitoring; so that, as has happened more than once in the past 30 years, it has on occasion closed the entire system without warning at times of acute political sensitivity. Even so, the telecom sector has so attractive a cash flow that five domestic banks and one offshore bank recently put together a finance package for the winning bidder of the outstanding jumbo telephone expansion contract. Since the 1970s and early 1980s when Sweden's Ericsson with Phillips of the Netherlands set up the original Dollars 5bn national telecommunications system, the standard of service has been very high. Overall supervision under successive three-year management contracts has been with Bell Canada and more recently with Australian Telecom, whose existing contract will expire next October. Earlier this month, Saudi and foreign companies were invited to prepare bids for the next three-year contract. Until the recent announcement of the jumbo expansion plan, several smaller works had been commissioned. In 1991 the UK's GPT (General Electric/Plessey Telecoms), in which Siemens has a 40 per cent interest, was given a Dollars 30m contract to install 2,000 card payphones in the Riyadh, Jeddah, and Makkah-Madinah areas. Last year, the US's AT&amp;T surprised the market by offering a 44 per cent discount on a Dollars 90m gross bid to supply hand-held and vehicle-mounted mobile telephones; it being standard practice in this market to offer a discount at the time the bid envelope is opened. At the end of last month, a Finnish company, Technoman, won a SR28m (Dollars 7.5m) order to set up 200,000 pager lines by 1995, and Siemens last February won a Dollars 120m contract to supply and install 190,000 telephone lines to help ease the serious shortage for domestic and business users. But this was only a taster for the jumbo contract now being evaluated to try to bring supply in line with demand. Six pre-qualified companies - AT&amp;T, France's Alcatel, Ericsson with Japan's NEC, Canada's Northern Telecom and Siemens with input from GPT - have made offers which with discounts vary from Dollars 3.5bn gross to Dollars 1.6bn for the PTT's Telephone Expansion Project number 6 (TEP6). This involves supplying and laying 500,000 to 1.5m lines plus provision for other infrastructure needs including support buildings, microwave towers, fibre-optic links, satellite connections, subscriber radio telephones for rural and desert areas, new switching systems and maintenance. Early this month, Alcatel was reported to have offered to install 1m lines for the same price as 500,000. Provision for new cellular telephones, originally part of the jumbo package, has been taken out, to be bid separately by the same companies. Because of the widely differing systems on offer, the technical evaluation will not be complete until well into next year, by which time the amount of money available to the PTT ministry will have become partly clearer after publication of the 1994 budget in January. When the PTT called for these bids, it also sought supplier financing to be part of the tender offer. This would involve the export credit agency of the country or countries concerned, but the kingdom's banks are also so liquid, and with telecoms having the cash flow that it does, that six banks came up with their own financing proposal for the winning bidder. For obvious reasons, the banks are not prepared to discuss details of their proposal but the logic behind their initiative is not hard to find. Official budgetary constraints are such that expansion schemes of this kind are more and more likely to go off-budget; to be financed by bank lending and/or supplier finance, and possibly equity financing or leasebacks. To date, the problem has been that even export credit agencies, not to mention domestic or offshore banks, want a finance ministry guarantee to ensure that the settlement risk on the total loan money lies with the Saudi government, even though PTT, as a government ministry, is tantamount to being a sovereign risk. But the finance ministry is no more likely to give a guarantee for TEP6 than it was for the recent long-term riyal loan for Saudi Consolidated Electric Company for the Western Region. Since equity financing through privatisation would seem not to be an option in the case of PTT, the banks are having to call on all their innovative abilities to find ways to take part. One area reportedly being discussed is for the winning bidder(s) on TEP6 to raise the capital to complete the contract and to lease the system back to the government.</p>

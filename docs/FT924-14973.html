			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / International Company News: US insurer returns to its Chinese roots AMERICAN International Group (AIG), the US insurance group, has been granted the first licence to sell insurance in China, initially in Shanghai. For AIG, the licence represents a return to its roots. The company was founded in Shanghai in 1919 by Mr C. V. Starr, an American entrepreneur, but was forced to quit the country when the communists took over in 1949. The licensing of AIG further illustrates the growing deregulation of China's financial services markets. China plans to admit foreign stockbrokers to conduct business on its two stock exchanges, and foreign banks are also expected to be permitted to conduct business in the future. Mr M. R. Greenberg, AIG chairman, who is visiting Shanghai, said his company's roots were in Asia. 'We will focus on building our staff and developing products tailored to the needs of this market.' AIG will be permitted to sell life insurance to individual Chinese and foreign nationals. It will also be able to sell property and casualty insurance to joint venture companies and other foreign businesses in Shanghai. Before the communist takeover, Shanghai - often described as the Paris of the East - was China's industrial and financial centre. It has lagged behind since China embarked on its 'open door' policy 13 years ago, but recently has moved to the front of policymakers' interests and is now catching up rapidly with more advanced areas in the south. Mr Greenberg said he believed AIG's presence would help attract investment for Shanghai's development. AIG has a well-established presence in the Far East - both in life insurance, via American International Assurance, which claims to be the region's largest life operation, and in the property-casualty sector. The area is, however, attracting interest from other big US insurers - and several have established life insurance operations in the region.</p>

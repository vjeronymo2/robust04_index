			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Justinas Karosas, chairman of the Lithuanian </F> Democratic Labor Party, LDDP, faction in the Seimas: "Where  Will Russia Turn?"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Certainly, Lithuania is  particularly concerned over the political situation that has  emerged in Russia after the elections. We cannot alone rely on  the authority that the new Russian constitution grants to  President B. Yeltsin to exercise a large influence on the  country's foreign and domestic policies. There is no doubt that  B. Yeltsin, being under pressure from the militant wing of the  legislature, will make certain compromises that will have a  negative effect on the Baltic states. It is difficult to  predict today what definite moves will be made in this  direction. It is clear, however, that our currently complicated  relations with the great neighbor will be even more complex.  Therefore, our policy toward Russia must be better considered  and adequately diplomatic.    First of all, we must take more intensive care of the  integration of Lithuania, as well as of other Baltic states,  with West European security structures. This, of course, does  not mean Lithuania's militarization, but only a protective  umbrella against any aggression. I think that the first  significant move in this direction was made last Wednesday [15  December] during a meeting of the three Baltic presidents in  Tallinn. The presidents clearly formulated and expressed the  desire of their countries to integrate with West European  security structures. It is probable that West European  countries will also become more attentive to the wishes of the  Baltic states after the change in Russia's political situation.    The second problem that we should consider seriously today  is  the possible economic pressure on our country. After the  collapse of the monopoly of Russia's Government as the sole  manager of production, private business structures, out of pure  economic interest, will do business with those who will bring a  higher profit.    Under political pressure, economic ties with Russia may  become more complicated. Therefore, it is vital for Lithuania  to look for alternatives in other countries. The advancement of  the construction of the oil terminal becomes simply crucial  within this context.    To put it short, Lithuania, as well as other Baltic states,  must closely observe events in Russia today and speed up its  integration into Western Europe by all possible measures;  certainly, by maintaining normal relations with all neighbors.</p>

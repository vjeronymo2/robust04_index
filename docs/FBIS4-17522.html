			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 23 (ITAR-TASS) -- The ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI  newspaper quotes the Russian president's press secretary  Vyacheslav Kostikov who told a Kremlin briefing on Friday that  Boris Yeltsin hopes for the success of the treaty on public  accord which is to be signed on April 28.    The newspaper prints the full text of a statement by the  leaders of the member republics of the Russian Federation, which  was adopted on April 21 after a meeting with the Russian  president. The statement expresses support for the agreement.    At the same time, the newspaper singles out a report that  the  Russian parliament lower house is not ready to sign the  document, since its new version needs examination.    It is reported that parliamentary groups intend to discuss  it  at party conferences, and political councils of parties in the  remaining days before April 28 "to hammer out a common position".    The SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA newspaper carries, in this  connection,  an article by Valeriy Zorkin, the former chairman of the Russian  constitutional court, who claims that "national accord cannot be  `introduced' by any decree".    According to Zorkin, "real compromise means strict  implementation of clearly outlined top priority measures  supported by all or the majority of people, without which it  will be impossible to check the country's sliding to a dreadful  disaster".    The KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper concentrates on the talks  between the Russian and Ukrainian military delegations in  Sevastopol.    The commentary on this topic says that the agreement signed  in Moscow on a gradual settlement of Black Sea Fleet problems  "was in actual fact a compromise and a concession of the Russian  side for the earliest settlement of contradictions between the  neighbouring countries".    However, the Ukrainian military delegation at the Sevastopol  talks "sees weak positions of the partners in the dialogue  behind the concession and puts forth absurd demands having  nothing to do with the presidents' understanding".    The military leaders have not cleared up the question which  was unequivocally settled by the presidents: "to divide the  Black Sea Fleet bases", the newspaper continues. The way out of  the Black Sea deadlock "has only gleamed in the distance but has  not fully appeared for the negotiating sides".    The RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA newspaper features an open letter to  Boris Yeltsin adopted by a meeting of the Union of Russian  North-Western Cities held in the city of Kirov.    It expresses concern that administration heads of such big  Russian cities as Omsk, Saratov, Vladivostok and Nizhny Novgorod  were released from their posts under the pressure of regional  governors over the past few months.    The newspaper claims that the posts were left by honest  people vitally interested in the prosperity of their cities.  The message contains a demand to carry out inspections in  connection with complaints of ousted administration heads and to  publish their results.    The TRUD newspaper carries an interview with director of the  Federal Counterintelligence Service Sergey Stepashin on  corruption in executive bodies. Confirming the existence of  corruption, including in the top echelon, he stressed: "We know  about this and actively work in this direction", but there is no  point in raising ballyhoo about this.    "We declare an all-out war on corruption", the struggle  against which, as general struggle against crime, "becomes an  important task of ensuring national security", Stepashin  stressed.    The Moscow press gives an extensive coverage to the  situation  in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister  Vitaliy Churkin said in an interview with ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI that  Serbs' continued attacks in the area of Gorazde lead to their  disaster.    The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper writes the following:  Since  Russia abides by the opinion that "one should not be in a hurry  to spread the zone of air strikes in Bosnia", it turns out that  Russia, the United States, the EU and the U.N. "have no common  approach to a solution of the crisis".    The newspaper claims that the absence of a common diplomatic  plan for a settlement will lead to a sitation when "a decision  will be taken, most probably, without taking into consideration  Russia's opinion".    According to the KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper, Moscow and  Washington do not intend to yield the palm to each other in  initiatives. The Kremlin insists on calling a summit on former  Yugoslavia, and the White House does not object against this,  suggesting only that it should be prepared well.    In the meantime, the newspaper states, U.S. President Bill  Clinton put forth his own plan providing for "possible further  air strikes on Serbs".    The PRAVDA newspaper runs information on demonstrations and  rallies in Moscow by opposition forces on the occasion of  Vladimir Lenin's birthday. The newspaper describes in detail  exhibits of an exposition named "Attempt on Memory" which opened  at the Pavilion "Lenin's Funeral Train" on Friday.</p>

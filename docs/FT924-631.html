			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Credit and debit cards escape scrutiny by MMC CREDIT and debit card companies have escaped an investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission into the fees they charge retailers, but face further scrutiny by Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading. Sir Bryan announced yesterday he would not refer credit and debit card markets to the MMC. He said he would inquire into three possible unfair practices. The decision was welcomed by banks and retailers who have complained about charges over the past two years. The most recent complaint over debit card charges was made by five supermarket chains this summer. Sir Bryan said Office of Fair Trading inquiries had not found collusion over fee increases among banks which issue credit and debit cards. There was also no evidence the issuing banks were making excessive profits. The most recent controversy over debit card charges was sparked in June when Asda, Gateway, Safeway, J. Sainsbury and Tesco complained about a rise in the fee charged on each Switch card transaction from about 5p to 11p. The fee charged on credit card transactions has narrowed to about 1.5 per cent of each purchase for big retailers because of increased competition among banks to carry out processing. This followed the 1989 MMC report on credit cards. Sir Bryan said he would review credit and debit card markets in two years. Meanwhile, he would informally check three practices: Retailers which accept cards such as Visa and Mastercard are obliged to honour any issuer's card and are subject to minimum fees on some transactions. Sir Bryan said he was concerned that this might mean 'inflexible and unresponsive' pricing. Although retailers can charge different prices for purchases made by credit cards rather than cheques or cash, this cannot be done for debit and charge cards. Sir Bryan said this seemed 'an anomaly' and he would ask if it could be removed. Only banks are allowed to act as the 'merchant acquirers' which carry out card processing and transactions on behalf of retailers for a fee. He said he would ask if more merchant acquirers could enter the market. Mr Colin Smith, chairman of the committee of retailers which complained about debit card pricing in June, said retailers looked forward to co-operating with the director-general in the further inquiries he had proposed. Mr Richard Reay-Smith, chief executive of Barclaycard, said the decision was 'a victory for the consumer'. Card operators had demonstrated that card processing was a very competitive business, and pricing was often below cost.</p>

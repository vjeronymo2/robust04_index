			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / France makes it easier to bring government ministers to book FRANCE'S constitution was changed yesterday to make it easier to prosecute government ministers accused of misconduct and to insulate the judiciary from political influence. The National Assembly and Senate, sitting jointly in the palace at Versailles, as they do only for constitutional revisions, voted for a less politicised impeachment procedure than that by which Mr Laurent Fabius and two other former Socialist ministers are to be tried for alleged responsibiity in the contamination of blood supplies with the HIV virus. Four former public health officials involved in the same case, had their prison sentences confirmed by the appeal court last week. Under the existing impeachment procedure - to be retained only for accusations involving the president - parliament brings the charges and sits in judgment on them. In future, anyone will be able to bring actual or former ministers before a magistrates' court for crimes committed in the exercise of office. The magistrates will determine whether charges should be brought. Only at the trial stage will six deputies and six senators be included on the judges' bench. The case of HIV-contaminated blood, for which many relatives of the infected haemophiliacs have held former ministers responsible, has been the catalyst for reform. Mr Fabius, who was prime minister in 1984-86, actually voted last December in favour of his own impeachment so he could clear his name. However, that impeachment move was overtaken by the parliamentary elections in March and President Francois Mitterrand's proposals for constitutional reform. The only other reform approved yesterday was to dilute the president's power of appointment to the higher judiciary council which nominates and disciplines magistrates and judges. Accusations that France's magistrates come under undue influence from the government as well as the presidency have been echoed in recent days by Mr Bernard Tapie. A former minister, he owns the Olympique-Marseilles football team which is now under investigation for bribery.</p>

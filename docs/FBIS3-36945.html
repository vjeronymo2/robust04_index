			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Feb 09, BNS -- A fast integration of the  Baltic states into NATO would be of advantage to the whole of  Europe, Norwegian Defense Minister Jorgen Kosmo said today.    Kosmo made the remarks in his speech at the Viking Revue '94  conference of NATO's North European group.    The mayor of Russia's St. Petersburg, Anatoliy Sobchak, in  his response termed the position of the Norwegian minister as  "very dangerous."    Sobchak in his address to the conference among other issues  reasserted Russia's stance that the regions of Jaanilinn  (Ivangorod) and Petseri were traditional Russian lands and that  Estonia's claims for these areas were lacking any grounds.    He also said that "a rise of nationalism" was in evidence in  many former republics of what was once the Soviet Union.    The Estonian delegation to the Viking Revue meeting  comprises  the commander-in-chief of the country's defense forces, General  Aleksander Einseln, and deputy chancellor of the Defense  Ministry, Tarmo Molder.</p>

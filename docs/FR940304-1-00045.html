			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For this delisting determination, the Agency used such information to identify plausible exposure routes ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , ground water, surface water, air) for hazardous constituents present in the petitioned waste. The Agency determined that disposal in a landfill is the most reasonable, worst-case disposal scenario for BSC's petitioned waste, and that the major exposure route of concern would be ingestion of contaminated ground water. Therefore, the Agency is proposing to use a particular fate and transport model to predict the maximum allowable concentrations of hazardous constituents that may be released from the petitioned waste after disposal in a regulated municipal solid waste landfill and to determine the potential impact of disposal of BSC's waste on human health and the environment. Specifically, the Agency used the maximum estimated waste volume and the maximum reported leachate concentrations as inputs to estimate the constituent concentrations in the ground water at a hypothetical receptor well downgradient from the disposal site. The calculated receptor well concentrations (referred to as compliance-point concentrations) were then compared directly to the health-based levels used in delisting decision-making for the hazardous constituents of concern.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes that this fate and transport model represents a reasonable worst-case scenario for disposal of the petitioned waste in a landfill, and that a reasonable worst-case scenario is appropriate when evaluating whether a waste should be relieved of the protective management constraints of RCRA Subtitle C. The use of a reasonable worst-case scenario results in conservative values for the compliance-point concentrations and ensures that the waste, once removed from hazardous waste regulation, will not pose a threat to human health or the environment. Because a delisted waste is no longer subject to hazardous waste control, the Agency is generally unable to predict and does not control how a waste will be managed after delisting. Therefore, EPA currently believes that it is inappropriate to consider extensive site-specific factors when applying the fate and transport model. For example, a generator may petition the Agency for delisting of a metal hydroxide sludge which is currently being managed in an on-site landfill and provide data on the nearest drinking water well, permeability of the aquifer, dispersivities, etc. If the Agency were to base its evaluation solely on these site-specific factors, the Agency might conclude that the waste, at that specific location, cannot affect the closest well, and the Agency might grant the petition. Upon promulgation of the exclusion, however, the generator is under no obligation to continue to manage the waste at the on-site landfill. In fact, it is likely that the generator will either choose to send the delisted waste off-site immediately, or will eventually reach the capacity of the on-site facility and subsequently send the waste off site to a facility which may have very different hydrogeological and exposure conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency also considers the applicability of ground-water monitoring data during the evaluation of delisting petitions. In this case, the Agency determined that, because BSC is seeking an upfront delisting ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , an exclusion based on data from waste generated from a bench-scale treatment process), ground-water monitoring data collected from the areas where the petitioner plans to dispose of the waste in the future are not necessary. Because the petitioned waste is not currently generated or disposed of, ground-water monitoring data would not characterize the effects of the petitioned waste on the underlying aquifer at the disposal sites and, thus, would serve no purpose. Therefore, the Agency did not request ground-water monitoring data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BSC petitioned the Agency for an upfront exclusion (for waste that has not yet been generated) based on descriptions of the proposed stabilization process that will be used to treat BSC's dewatered filter cake, characterization of dewatered (unstabilized) filter cake, and results from the analysis of waste subjected to BSC's proposed stabilization process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

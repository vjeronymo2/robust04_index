			<p>CSO     [Text] The import of semiconductors from South Korea and  Taiwan is rapidly increasing. According to trade statistics of  the Ministry of Finance, the amount of memory imports from  January to April 1994 was 36.7 billion yen or 3.3 times the same  period of the previous year for Korean-made chips and 3.1  billion yen or 8.6 times the same period of the previous year  for Taiwan-made chips. The high yen and recovery of domestic  demand is behind the rapid increase in imports. On the other  hand, with the favorable trend of U.S. personal computer  shipments, exports to the United States are progressing steadily  at 95.1 billion yen, a 26.5-percent increase over the same  period of the previous year, and amplified the sense of a  product shortage in the domestic market. It seems that the  influx of Korean and Taiwan imports will continue in the future  also.    The core of imports from South Korea is 4-megabit DRAM  (dynamic random access memory), which are procured by  information communications instrument makers and personal  computer peripheral makers who produce extended memory boards  for the United States. Imports of mask ROM (read-only memory)  used in game machines have also been increasing since around  last year.    Many of the Taiwan products are mask ROM and EPROM  (erasable,  programmable ROM) used in OA [office automation] machines. The  fact that "the quality of Taiwan-made semiconductors is steadily  rising" (electrical machinery manufacturer) has been cited as a  primary factor for the increase in imports.    Driven by the increased production of memory for personal  computers for the United States, a shortage is continuing for  various kinds of memory in the domestic market, including DRAM.  Actually, the BB ratio (ratio of amount of orders received to  amount of shipments) of the U.S. semiconductor market in April  was on a high level of 1.14.    The amount of memory needed due to the strengthened  functions  of personal computer software is increasing, and major domestic  semiconductor manufacturers just about agree with the view that  "at least the U.S. memory demand will progress vigorously within  the year."</p>

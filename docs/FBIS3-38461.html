			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Summary of `Declaration of Intent' </F> of Progressive Area Parties; Central Points of Agreement"]    [Text] Rome -- These are the main points of the progressive  forces' "declaration of intent":     -  We want to promote a new  democratic pact among the Italian people -- a new and closer  rapport between rights and duties based on a real and widespread  exercise of democratic responsibility;    -  There must be a  redistribution and decentralization of powers in order to  achieve the most effective balance between national unity and  the system of local government;    -  To open up new paths for the  country's economic and social development, while at the same  time guaranteeing public finance reform, employment growth, and  the safeguarding of the country's environmental and cultural  heritage;    -  In order to restore dynamism to the economy, to defeat  parasitism and the abuse of the welfare state, it is necessary  to redefine public intervention and to promote privatization,  when appropriate, on the basis of a stringent analysis of the  merits of each individual case in order to assess which really  are useful to the community;    -  The reduction of the deficit will  entail austerity, but we undertake to guarantee that the  sacrifices will be shared fairly and that they will not  adversely affect the living standards of the most disadvantaged,  to whom the state must indeed guarantee the rights of  citizenship -- health, education, work, housing, and social  security, that is, an improvement of their present living  conditions;    -  This means a more temperate and supportive society  in which the welfare state -- no longer abused or corrupt --  will develop into an integrated system of protection.... The  public role of education, training, health, and of the social  services as a whole must be guaranteed and emphasized. All  economic development options must also be subjected to  obligatory environmental evaluation.</p>

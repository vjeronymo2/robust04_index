			<p><P> February 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JURY ACQUITS MURDERER IN JAIL ESCAPE  </P> <P> A convicted murderer persuaded an Orange County jury Friday that he should be  acquitted of escape charges, because he had been beaten and had fled for his  life.  </P> <P> The Superior Court verdict, which stunned the Sheriff's Department, came in the  escape trial of Ivan Von Staich, who has been serving a 37-years-to-life  sentence for the 1983 claw-hammer attack on his girlfriend and the murder of  her husband.  </P> <P> Von Staich escaped on Jan. 26, 1986. Apprehended in Massachusetts about a month  later, he claimed that he had been beaten by Orange County sheriff's deputies  who serve as jail guards.  </P> <P> He acted as his own attorney in the escape trial, using a rare,  seldom-successful legal interpretation called "defense of necessity," as his  justification for escaping. The defense allows acquittal on an escape charge if  the escapee can prove several things, including that his or her life was in  danger.  </P> <P> At the time of the escape, Von Staich was in the Orange County Jail awaiting  sentencing for his previous crimes. He will now be sent to state prison. His  victory Friday means that he will not have more time added to his sentence.  </P> <P> "I am completely astounded at the decision," said Lt. Richard Olson, spokesman  for the Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. William Overtoom, the prosecutor, said he was "disappointed"  and believed that "the jurors were confused" by the complex case.  </P> <P> In closing arguments, Overtoom acknowledged that Von Staich had been beaten in  jail but did not confirm Von Staich's contention that he was beaten by  deputies.  </P> <P> Jurors acknowledged in interviews that they did not believe all of Von Staich's  testimony. But they said the prosecution failed to disprove many points Von  Staich raised, including his remarks about being beaten.  </P> <P> "We knew he was a convicted felon, but all of us on the jury decided he should  be treated as innocent (of the jail escape charge) unless we found a  preponderance of evidence against him, and we did not," said jury foreman Kevin  Paul Little, 23, of Garden Grove.  </P></p>

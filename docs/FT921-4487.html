			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Plea at trial over Banco Ambrosiano AN ITALIAN prosecutor yesterday demanded jail terms for Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the industrialist, Licio Gelli, leader of the banned P2 masonic lodge, and about 30 other people for alleged involvement in the collapse of Banco Ambrosiano a decade ago, Reuter reports from Milan. 'De Benedetti was fully aware of the grave difficulties in which the bank was in,' Mr Pier Luigi Dell'Osso told the court. A decision is expected in about six weeks in a trial that began in May 1990. Banco Ambrosiano collapsed in August 1982 with debts of Dollars 1bn in Italy's largest post-war banking scandal.</p>

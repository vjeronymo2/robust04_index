			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Vocational study sees maths gap VOCATIONAL qualifications should be strengthened in their mathematics component, according to a study that compares the UK with France. The study, published by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, concludes that maths teaching in France was more successful partly because all vocational students studied a core mathematics curriculum of a consistent standard. In the UK, there was no core curriculum of mathematics and the new employer-led vocational qualifications provided little incentive for its teaching. The author of the study, Mrs Alison Wolf, senior research officer and research lecturer at the Institute of Education at the University of London, said: 'This neglect of a core subject area hinders progression within the qualifications system, depresses attainment and lowers aspirations of both teachers and students.' The study recommends specifying mathematical skills and formal examination of mathematics in vocational courses. National Institute Discussion Paper Number 23.

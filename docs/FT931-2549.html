			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Two arrested over Bombay bombing Bombay police said two men were arrested yesterday for planting bombs in a wave of attacks which killed at least 250 people and injured more than 1,200 in Bombay last week, writes Shiraz Sidhva in New Delhi. Bombay police chief Amarjeet Singh Samra said one of the men had driven a jeep packed with plastic explosives to a market place in central Bombay. The other had confessed to planting a bomb in the city's crowded jewellery market. Six suspects arrested so far have all been linked to the Memon brothers, smugglers who have since escaped to Dubai. The police allege that the Memons have been involved in the narcotics trade, gun-running, silver smuggling and foreign exchange rackets. Police said the intention of the bombings was to 'disturb the peace in Bombay and take advantage of the turmoil to further their illegal business.' Meanwhile, the death toll in the blast in central Calcutta rose to 80. Police have found no links between the Bombay and Calcutta blasts.</p>

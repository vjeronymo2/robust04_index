			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Kazakhs in deal with Israelis AN Israeli company has signed a Dollars 160m agreement with Kazakhstan's government to make and install irrigation equipment in the republic's southern Chimkent province, writes Hugh Carnegy in Jerusalem. The Eisenberg Group announced the deal this week during a visit by a trade delegation from Kazakhstan. It is the biggest contract won yet by Israeli companies working to establish ties with the Moslem former Soviet republics. Under the agreement, Eisenberg will build a plant to produce drip irrigation piping and will install systems covering 50,000 acres of cotton, cereals, fruit and other crops. Payment will mostly be in locally produced commodities, it is understood. The remoteness of the central Asian states and their lack of hard currency have not deterred several Israeli companies from seeking to establish trade ties. They are backed by the government, which sees long-term advantages in forging links to non-Arab Moslem countries with large natural resources on the northern fringe of the Middle East.</p>

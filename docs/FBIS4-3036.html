			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 18 (CNA) -- The Republic of China  [ROC] has ordered its representative office in Indonesia to help  protect the safety of Taiwan businessmen there in the wake of a  labor riot in the northern Sumatran city of Medan, a Ministry of  Foreign Affairs Spokesman said Monday [18 April].    "We have expressed our concern about the medan labor rioting  to the Indonesian Government and have ordered our representative  office in Jakarta to strengthen protection for our businessmen  there," said Ouyang Jui-hsiung, director of the Ministry's  Department of Information and Cultural Affairs.    According to foreign wire service reports, a labor protest  at  a medan factory over wages and holiday bonus payments last  Thursday turned into a highly-charged race riot against the  economically dominant ethnic Chinese. Banks, shops and cars in  Medan and several other Sumatran cities were attacked and one  person was reported killed.    Ouyang, quoting reports from Taipei's representative office  in Jakarta, said the riot in Medan has almost been quelled and  life there has begun to return to normal.    He added it remains to be seen whether the incident would  affect the government's "southern strategy," which encourages  Taiwan manufacturers to invest more in southeast Asia instead of  Mainland China. "We'll keep close watch on developments in  Indonesia," he noted.    Vice Economic Affairs Minister Yang Shih-chien told a  Legislative Yuan committee meeting that the Medan labor riot has  not inflicted any damage on Taiwan-owned companies in Indonesia.    Yang pointed out Taiwan businessmen are generally regarded  as  "foreigners" in Indonesia, so they have not been affected by the  anti-ethnic Chinese sentiment there.    Another Vice Economic Affairs Minister, S.J. Li, also said  the ROC need not change its "southern strategy" simply because  of the recent labor riot in Indonesia.    "The Indonesian Government is obligated to protect Taiwan  investors since the two countries signed an investment guarantee  agreement in 1990," Li explained.    During his recent visit to Jakarta, Li, on behalf of the ROC  government, further signed a reciprocal tax exemption accord  with Indonesia to avoid double taxation on investors from each  side.    "Indonesian officials once assured me that Indonesia seeks  steady economic development and will do its best to protect  foreign investors," Li noted.    "I believe Indonesia will properly resolve its recent labor  unrest soon," Li said.    Taiwan is the third largest foreign investor in Indonesia  after Japan and Hong Kong, with its total investment standing at  US$4.03 billion at the end of 1993.</p>

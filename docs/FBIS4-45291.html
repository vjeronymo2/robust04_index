			<p>Protectors'   of `Vaticano'   <F P=102> PY0306032494 Lima LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 25 May 94 p 19 </F> <F P=103> PY0306032494 </F> <F P=104>  Lima LA REPUBLICA </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN     [Text] According to a reliable judicial source, General  Jaime Rios Arayco said, in his testimony before Judge Gloria  Arteaga Lucas: "I am just a scapegoat. The real protectors of  `Vaticano' are other people, and some of them were rewarded with  appointments abroad."    Gen. Rios admitted, however, that Demetrio Chavez  Penaherrera  ["Vaticano"] virtually fed the troops deployed in his area of  operations by giving them money and other donations.    In his testimony Gen. Rios said: "At that time we did not  know he was a drug trafficker. Everyone knew him as a  prosperous businessman, some kind of generous patron."    Gen. Rios and the other officers accused of covering up drug  trafficking and allowing corruption are being held on Punta  Lobos Island, Pucusana, in charge of Air Force personnel.    General Frank Tweddle Granda, who was sentenced to 15 years  in prison for drug trafficking, was also held there from 1980 to  1981.    According to the accusations, Gen. Jaime Rios Arayco and the  other officers did not take any measures during their stay on  the Huallaga Front to repress the criminal activities of  Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera, "Vaticano," and his gang. On the  contrary, they had friendly contact with him and received  "donations" on several occasions.    It is even said that Gen. Rios personally prevented the  capture of some of "Vaticano's" agents, and reprimanded the  policemen who carried out antidrug operations against his  consent and authorization.    In this regard, Gen. Rios told Judge Gloria Arteaga that the  accusations are not true, and that he has become "a scapegoat"  to hide the real protectors of drug trafficking, some of whom  "have been rewarded with appointments abroad."    Apparently Rios was referring to General Eduardo Bellido  Mora, brother-in-law of Army Commander General Nicolas de Bari  Hermoza Rios. According to various reports, including the  comments of Major Evaristo Castillo Aste, Bellido Mora has been  mentioned as one of the "protectors" of Demetrio Chavez  Penaherrera. Bellido is currently the Peruvian military attache  in Israel.    It was learned from judicial sources that the other officers  who were also accused with Gen. Rios Arayco have basically  agreed with their chief on the Huallaga Front that Demetrio  Chavez virtually fed the Army Command, donating money to feed  the troops deployed in that zone to fight drug trafficking and  terrorism. But according to their instructions, they were not  aware Chavez was a drug trafficker.    Regarding this case, it was learned yesterday that the judge  of the 42d Criminal Court will ask the president of the Lima  Superior Court to add the accusations under investigation in the  47th Criminal Court to the one he--Judge Alzamora--has been  investigating for months against the main suspect, Demetrio  Chavez Penaherrera, "Vaticano."    A judicial spokesman said that the joining of the cases  would  be appropriate as they deal with the same charges against  "Vaticano," for the sake of economy in the legal process, and  because events of the same nature, and against the same people,  cannot be separated.    In was reported by judicial sources that Judge Gloria  Arteaga  has scheduled for next week new testimony by Gen. Rios Arayco  and the other officers.</p>

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / International Bonds: Borrowers target deals at retail investors The euromarket saw a selection of carefully targeted deals yesterday, following the trend of short-dated issues. Poland is planning its debut eurobond, believed to be a Dollars 200m five-year deal for next spring, and the Spanish province of Andalusia is believed to be bringing a five-year deal. An AAA-rated borrower is rumoured to be preparing a 20-year peseta deal. Bayerische Vereinsbank came to the market for the second day running. Lead manager Hambros reported 'a very good first-day response' for the ADollars 100m five-year deal with a 10 per cent coupon. Other syndicate managers praised the pricing on the deal, which followed offerings for NAB and Commerzbank this year. Hambros said the spread on those deals had tightened in since launch. Also in the Australian dollar sector, Nomura handled a three-year ADollars 100m deal for New South Wales Treasury Corp with a 4.5 per cent coupon and a price of 88.961. Other syndicate managers said the coupon and price suggested it was aimed at Tokyo investors. CSFB also targeted the DSL Finance DM300m four-year deal with a 7 1/8 per cent coupon at a strong lead order out of Switzerland. JP Morgan used the same currency and maturity to bring a DM250m four-year deal with a 7 1/4 per cent coupon for JP Morgan &amp; Co aimed at retail demand on the European continent. Investors pick up 36 basis points by moving one year out along the curve to the four-year area. Morgan said the 10-year bund contract was trading around 88.85 at launch but fell back to 88.63. The bonds came at a spread of 14 basis points over and Morgan said they were trading at between 14 and 17. Wood Gundy handled a seven-year CDollars 165m deal with a 9 per cent coupon for the European Investment Bank which received positive comments from other houses. One said: 'This deal will work well.' Manhattan Card Co brought a Dollars 200m offering guaranteed by credit card-backed assets in Hong Kong and lead-manager Chase Securities said most demand for the deal had come from Europe.</p>

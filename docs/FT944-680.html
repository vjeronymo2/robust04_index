			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Farringford rallies Farringford, which operates a hotel of that name on the Isle of Wight, reported a reduced pre-tax deficit of Pounds 16,000 for the six months to August 31, against Pounds 42,000. Turnover edged ahead from Pounds 403,000 to Pounds 431,000. The improvement reflected a better showing from the hotel and reduced head office overheads. Directors stressed, however, that the period under review was seasonally favourable and that no profit was anticipated for the second half. Losses per share narrowed to 0.1p (0.21p). Directors said they were still seeking suitable acquisitions.</p>

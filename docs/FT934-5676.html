			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Arts: Master Builder avoids the Scottish tendency - Theatre in Edinburgh Brian Cox - the National Theatre's most recent Lear and the RSC's award-winning Titus Andronicus has returned to Edinburgh's Royal Lyceum as leading actor and co-director of Ibsen's The Master Builder. Cox, who started his career at the Lyceum, is not one of those Scots who disregards refined playing in favour of a Scottish slant, sometimes called 'Glaswegian vulgarity'. His Master Builder, played with Scottish accents but set in Norway, is a splendid example to Edinburgh theatre of how to avoid the excesses of this 'Scottish tendency'. In a Lyceum programme interview, Cox speaks of his training at Lamda ('I came from Dundee so Glasgow was as alien a place to me as London was') and says that he 'can't stand nationalism'. Later this season Bill Paterson, a more overtly Scottish actor also acclaimed for his London stage work, returns to the Lyceum in Bulgakov's A Mongrel's Heart. It would be splendid if, in a later season, the Lyceum could bring Cox back in a major Shakespeare role - Anthony (and Cleopatra), Timon, Othello or, most obviously, 'the Scottish play'. Cox dominates this production as Halvard Solness, the master builder, showing him as a working man who has raised himself by driving ambition and industry; he uses his bullish, neckless, physical power and vocal force to show this master builder as an ageing, domineering dynamo. (Morag Hood plays his wife as an altogether more cultivated and delicate Edinburgh type, smiling nobly through adversity: a beautiful performance.) It is plain that Hilde Wangel (Siri Neal), who arrives to change his life, comes from far away; she is the least Scottish character. Cox uses ten silent young apprentices to 'frame' the production. They function as part of Solness's workforce, as town spectators, and to help move scenery. One in particular stands still, looking out at us, before each act. He, and they, stand for many things: the child that Solness once was, the children Solness and his wife lost, the youthfulness Solness dreads and is fascinated by. Clever, but actually too intrusive in a play whose symbolism and ambiguities are already prominent. In this production those meanings and ambiguities are vivid. Ibsen embodies, at the same time, the Romanticism of the early 19th century (Solness forever bursting against the confines of home and marriage), the naturalism and symbolism of the late 19th century (the social realism of the workplace; Solness and Hilde building their idealistic 'castles in the air'), and the psychological investigations of the early 20th. Tom Piper has designed sets that economically and handsomely suggest the play's spires and aerial castles, its utilitarian domestic architecture, its Nordic light and dark, its Puritan simplicity, its recesses and distances. Cox strikingly combines visceral force with intellectual refinement. However, as in some of his recent London performances, he forces so much volume and impact from certain lines that they break the cumulative drama. Neal, an altogether less mighty performer, is slightly too arch a Hilde, nor does she have all the character's heartless impulsiveness, but she keeps keenly alive the gist and detail of every scene. The Lyceum's previous production was Kenny Ireland's staging of A Midsummer Night's Dream. I caught it at the end of its transfer run in Glasgow. Ireland is developing a real repertory company here; it was good to see some of the same actors who had been in his Recruiting Officer earlier this autumn. Few of them, however, know how to combine clear verse-speaking with naturalism; and Ireland added an unnecessary layer of tricksiness by placing an echo around the fairies' voices. Rae Smith's scenery helped them to achieve some wonderful instant disappearing acts, but everything was an awkward mixture of staginess and superficiality - until the Pyramus and Thisbe scene, which worked like (excuse the pun) a dream. At the Traverse, Sue Glover's Bondagers, a hit of the 1991 season, has been revived. A beautiful play, it movingly does honour to a vanished part of Scottish social history: the female agricultural labourers (bondagers) who, in the last century, moved each year from farm to farm within a small radius. No man appears; the cast consists of six women. (Ian Brown directs.) The finest parts of the play are the virtually plotless body of its first half, and the ending. The story that wells up between these sections - a tale of sexual abuse, a mentally defective girl, rape, murder or accidental death, and punishment - is certainly affecting but relatively obvious. But the lyricism of the outer scenes is haunting; I love the way that the rhythms and spacings of agricultural work are caught, and the intimacies and tensions of female colloquy. Here Scottish acting, Scottish theatre, Scottish history are all admirably interwoven. The Master Builder continues at the Lyceum until December 11: 031-229-9697. Bondagers runs at the Traverse until December 19: 031-228-1404.</p>

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Austrian coalition set to hold power but right gains Austria's long-ruling coalition of conservatives and socialists, led by Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, looked set to return to power after yesterday's national elections, but with a much reduced 63 per cent of the vote, down from 75 per cent in 1990. Voters deserted the Social Democratic party and the conservative Austrian People's party (OVP) in large numbers for both right and leftwing fringe parties, raising the prospect of a significant realignment soon. The biggest winner was the charismatic Jorg Haider, leader of the far right Freedom party. The FPO raised its share from 16 per cent to nearly 23 per cent, and could theoretically form a conservative coalition with the OVP. However, both Mr Haider and Mr Erhard Busek, OVP leader, have ruled this out, and Mr Vranitzky and Mr Busek said last night they aimed to renew their pact. Mr Haider, who came to international attention with a complimentary comment three years ago about the employment policies of Hitler's Third Reich said he expected to lead the government after the next election. Adversaries do not accuse him of being a neo-Nazi, but he appealed openly during the campaign to voters' xenophobic tendencies, blaming immigrants for rising crime rates and accusing the government of treating them too generously. The coalition's poor result means it will have only 118 of parliament's 183 seats, down from 140. It will no longer have the two-thirds of seats needed for constitutional changes but can count on the support of the Liberal Forum, a new left-leaning party which won 5.7 per cent and 10 seats, for the vote to ratify European Union entry. The Greens, who raised their seat count from 10 to 13, have been divided on EU entry. Mr Haider opposed it vigorously, but in vain, in the referendum campaign four months ago. The coalition's lost support was blamed mainly on disenchantment with the cosy partnership between the socialists and conservatives that has governed since the second world war. Mr Haider was particularly effective during the campaign at rooting out examples of excessive patronage given to friends of the ruling parties. Last night he said the result was a sign 'we have finally succeeded in putting post-war Austria behind us and ushering in a genuine democracy'. The OVP's vote has been eroding since the mid-1980s. In this poll its share dropped from 32.1 per cent to 27.7 per cent for 52 seats, eight fewer. However, for the first time, the socialists were hurt, their share plunging from 42.8 per cent to 35 per cent and their seats falling from 80 to 66.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Ostanin] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 10 TASS -- Russia is developing new  regions of the world market of arms. Brazil and Malaysia began  to import Russian arms. Russia signed agreements with them in  early June. The Russian military-industrial complex is able to  restore its prestige of a reliable exporter of arms and military  equipment, ITAR-TASS was told in the main agency for  international cooperation of the Russian Defence Ministry.    In the 70's-80's, the USSR ranked first in the world for the  sale of conventional armaments. The peak of the Soviet export  of arms was reached in 1987 when armaments worth 22.6 billion  dollars were sold by the USSR. The USSR then accounted for 38  percent of world trade in arms.    According to foreign sources, Russia's share now amounts to  17 percent. From 1990 Russia reduced arms export to almost  one-fifth of the volume, yielding the lead to the United States  which now controls almost 60 percent of the world export of arms.    Russia's positions weakened in markets of Eastern Europe it  once dominated. East European countries now consider purchasing  NATO armaments. Russia's arms export to Nicaragua, Cuba, Laos  and Vietnam petered out. Joining United Nations sanction  banning arms sales to troubled areas, Russia discontinued the  export of arms to a dozen countries.    Russia now sells arms to some 50 countries. According to  military experts, the Russian military-industrial complex can  sell up to 30 billion dollars worth of arms a year, earning  10-12 billion dollars on new armaments.    Russia began to sell arms to Brazil from June 3. Under the  contract, Russia is to deliver to Brazil before the end of the  year a consignment of antiaircraft missile complexes "Igla" with  110 ground-to-air missiles. These missiles are regarded in  Brazil to be the cheapest missiles in the world market of arms.  They have proved their effectiveness.    The possibility of buying other military equipment from  Russia, including armoured carriers, is considered in Brazil.  The contract for Brazil's purchases of "Igla" complexes was  signed in the framework of the trade agreement between Russia  and Brazil concluded last year. The agreement will be effective  for four years. The total volume of deals for this period is  envisaged at two billion dollars. Under the agreement, Brazil  supplies to Russia coffee, sugar, soybeans in return for Russian  goods, including arms.    With the conclusion on June 7 of a contract to deliver 18  MiG-29 fighter planes Russia entered armaments market in  South-East Asia. MiG planes, for which there was a demand abroad  and Kalashnikov submachine guns accounted for 20 percent of the  Soviet export of arms. The deal with Malaysia is valued at  550.5 million dollars. The first plane of the batch will be  delivered next April. The other planes will be supplied within  eleven months. There are plans to perfect the plane.  Refuelling in mid-air will be made possible. The planes will be  armed with "air-to-air" missiles. The bombing load will be  increased from two to three tonnes. Russia will help Malaysia  train pilots. A centre for maintenance of MiG planes will be  set up. Russia will also help Malaysia develop the airospace,  defence and other industries. Under the contract, 25 percent of  the planes' cost will be repaid wilh palm oil products.    The Middle East market of arms remains the biggest market  for  Russian armaments. Saudi Arabia and the Arab Emirates are  interested in purchasing new kinds of arms from Russia. Russian  aircraft, tanks, antiaircraft and antitank complexes, personnel  carriers and naval ships sell well abroad.</p>

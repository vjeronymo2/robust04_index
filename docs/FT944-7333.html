			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Nerves on edge for the battle of amendments The corridors of the Commons were yesterday buzzing with speculation about the outcome of Monday's vote on the European Union finance bill. But as government whips anxiously counted and recounted their lists of loyal backbenchers, it became clear that the government's future rests on the willingness of Tory rebels to vote for a Labour amendment. Mr Bill Cash, a leading Eurosceptic Tory backbencher, sought to set the agenda early in the day by drafting an amendment giving the Commons public accounts committee powers to block Britain's EU contributions. The amendment reads: 'This house has confidence in Her Majesty's Government, but declines to give a second reading to the bill unless HMG gives an undertaking to the House of Commons that no money should be paid to the EC in any year under the own resources decision . . . unless and until the PAC of this House declares in that year that it is satisfied with the effectiveness of the new procedures for detecting and dealing with fraud in the EC.' The Eurosceptics know that the amendment is unacceptable to the government because it would set up a mechanism making it impossible for the government to give the EU guarantees that payments would be made when they become due. But under the arcane rules of the Commons, that did not matter to the Eurosceptics, because they know that the amendment will never be selected for debate by Mrs Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker. The intention was twofold: to make the Eurosceptic view crystal clear; and to provide an opportunity for Labour to maximise the potential vote against the government by adopting the rebels' tone and language. In the event, Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, tabled a toughly worded motion deploring fraud and waste, but couched in terms that make it unlikely that most of the rebels will dare to support it. When MPs decide at about 10pm on Monday, Labour's amendment will be voted on first. If it succeeds, it would delay implementation of the increased contributions until 1996 because no bill can be tabled twice in one year. That, however, would be academic because the success of the amendment would be regarded as a government defeat on an issue of confidence, prompting an immediate request by Mr John Major for a dissolution of parliament and a general election. It is more likely that the amendment will be defeated, and there would then be a vote on the second reading of the bill - approving the principle of the legislation. The division would be a sham because the failure of the amendment would have shown that the rebels were not prepared to defeat the government. If that happens, Labour says it would abstain. Other parties might follow suit, presenting the government with a resounding victory.</p>

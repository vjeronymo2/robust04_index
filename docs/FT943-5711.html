			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Observer: Native's return Love him or hate him, Ian Kerr, who penned L'Eminence Noire for the pages of International Financing Review, the bible of the Euromarkets, brought a biting wit to the antics of friend and foe. Since April, when he was lured to rival Euroweek, there has been something of a void at the staggeringly expensive (Pounds 2,000 plus per annum) yellow-jacketed weekly. Re-enter Peter Krijgsman, 39, former editor-in-chief of IFR, who left last autumn, and has now been rehired as a humble tittle-tattle recycler. Unlike Kerr, who had headed fixed income research at Kidder Peabody, Krijgsman has never seen the market from the inside. A some-time diarist at Accountancy Age - 'funnier than it sounds' - he has his contacts however, not least Kerr's enemies, from whom he would hear faithfully every Monday morning at IFR. But he will have a hard act to follow in the bitchiness and snobbery stakes, not to mention matching Kerr's penchant for coining nicknames which stick. CS First Boston's Alan 'Weetabix' Wheat, his spouse Mrs Shredded Wheat, and Christopher Robin (the gangly new London boss of UBS David Robbins) are just a few of the big cheeses who have been rechristened by Kerr. Even so, if Kriegelburger focuses on the current movers and shakers, rather than yesterday's men, he should be able to mine a tolerably untapped seam.</p>

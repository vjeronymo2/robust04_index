To  raise funds for the program, expenditures for public investments  will be added by over 1 trillion yen in the supplementary budget  for fiscal 1993. In line with the tax cut plans for those who  repair or change their houses, the government intends to offer  the housing loan program as a centerpiece of the pump-priming  package. Since the Japanese economy is still "fluctuating," (as  noted by the Economic Planning Agency), the government wants to  maintain high levels of housing investments.    In the initial 1993 budget, the Housing Loan Corporation  [HLC] provided a loans for 550,000 households. After that, the  government hammered out pump-primming packages twice in April  and September 1993, and expanded the quota by 50,000 and  100,000, respectively. As a result, the HLC loans became  available for 700,000 households this fiscal year, and this was  an unprecedented level.    Yet, applicants are eagerly filling the expanded quota  because of low interest rates. Under such circumstances, the  government has decided to further promote housing policy by  drastically expanding the loan quota. This is because promotion  of housing policies is in accord with "consumer-oriented"  political posture of the Hosokawa administration.    The government is planning to offer housing loans to 50,000  to 70,000 more households in the supplementary 1993 budget.  When the Construction Ministry made the fiscal 1994 budget  request last August, the quota for the housing loans in 1994 was  set at 560,000 households. However, Construction Minister Kozo  Igarashi recently said that he intends to expand the quota to  "over 600,000." In this regard, the size of the 1993  supplementary budget is expected to be finalized in view of the  1994 HLC program.</p>

			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / International Company News: Bell Canada review after rates setback BELL CANADA, the eastern Canada telecommunications utility and main income contributor to BCE, Canada's biggest telecommunications group, says it will make a sweeping review of its business after losing a bid to raise local telephone rates by an average of 10 per cent, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. Bell argued before the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission that it needed CDollars 315m (USDollars 238m) more revenues in 1993 and CDollars 520m in 1994 to maintain a reasonable return and offset revenues lost to long distance competition. For many years long distance rates have subsidised local rates. But the CRTC, the federal regulator, said Bell did not need the increases to retain 'financial integrity'. It reduced the company's allowable rate of return to 11 to 12 per cent from 12.5 to 13.5 per cent sought by Bell.</p>

			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Vaux up to Pounds 27m but no full recovery yet Difficult trading conditions in the hotel and brewing industry held pre-tax profits at Vaux Group to Pounds 26.6m, compared with Pounds 20.4m, in the year to September 30. Although the switch to FRS 3 suggested profits had increased by 31 per cent, the regional brewer, hotels and nursing homes operator said that, excluding income from property disposals and the sale of its Blayney's off-licence chain in 1992, profits increased by a more sluggish 7.1 per cent from Pounds 24.8m. Sir Paul Nicholson, chairman of the Sunderland-based company, said operating profits had improved in all divisions despite the lingering impact of the recession. Trading profits rose 8.6 per cent to Pounds 42.9m (Pounds 39.5m) on turnover 5 per cent lower at Pounds 234.9m (Pounds 247.3m). But he warned: 'A full recovery is not yet in prospect. Profits so far this year are only marginally ahead of last year's levels.' Group profits were also depressed by a sharp decline in interest receivable from Pounds 4.45m to Pounds 384,000. This was due mainly to the group's decision to withdraw cash from short-term deposits and increase borrowing from Pounds 122m to Pounds 132m. Earnings per share showed an adjusted increase of 9.9 per cent from 13.93p to 15.31p. A recommended final dividend of 6.25p (6.1p) gives a total for the year of 9.5p, against 9.35p. Capital expenditure fell by 58 per cent to Pounds 31.5m (Pounds 75.3m) as the group consolidated its existing property portfolio rather than continue with rapid expansion of the hotels business. Vaux and Ward Breweries, accounting for 44 per cent of group turnover, achieved a 10.2 increase in profits from Pounds 19.5m to Pounds 21.5m. Vaux Inns - comprising the group's 127 managed houses - saw profits rise 3.4 per cent to Pounds 4.9m (Pounds 4.7m) on turnover of Pounds 37.4m (Pounds 36.6m). For the first time since embarking on an expansion drive in 1987, Swallow Hotels reported better than expected results. Profits rose 10.5 per cent to Pounds 13.8m (Pounds 12.5m) on sales of Pounds 79.8m (Pounds 77.9m). In spite of the improvement, Sir Paul said recent bookings had been disappointing. St Andrews Homes, the nursing home operator and smallest part of the group, saw profits increase from Pounds 4.1m to Pounds 4.6m on turnover of Pounds 14m (Pounds 13m). COMMENT Inclement conditions in Vaux's trading area have not dented the group's conviction that it is well placed to profit from a recovery. That confidence was reflected yesterday by a dividend increase ahead of market expectations. A lower than forecast tax charge of Pounds 5.5m (Pounds 5.99m) also surprised analysts. But in the absence of an imminent recovery, profits next year are not expected to exceed Pounds 30m on a forward multiple of 15.6, making the shares seem expensive.</p>

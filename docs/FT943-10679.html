			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: US takes shine off BP rise Oil major British Petroleum pleased the market with a set of second-quarter figures well above market forecasts. The shares jumped 18 at one stage but in the afternoon US investors, who take a more cautious view of the stock, were happy to sell into strength and took the stock back to close 7 up at 418 1/2 p. Turnover of 22m shares was the highest in London. The unexpected element of the figures was the low tax charge, which encouraged analysts to raise forecasts by around Pounds 50m. Hoare Govett increased its full-year estimate to Pounds 1.4bn, while Mr Fergus Macleod of NatWest Securities argued that the temptation to take profits should be resisted ahead of a big presentation on the group's upstream performance in mid-September.</p>

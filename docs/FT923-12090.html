			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Gingrich faces primary trouble REPRESENTATIVE Newt Gingrich, the mop-headed right-wing Republican from Georgia, has long been the scourge of the Democrats in Congress, castigating their politics, their perks and their personal probity. But the Democrats are now relishing a sweeter revenge than they could have dreamed of: Mr Gingrich today faces a tough primary election against a fellow-Republican who has turned all his taunts against him, branding him as just another Congressional fat cat. Mr Gingrich's gadfly tongue so irritated the Democrats who dominate Georgian politics that they seized the opportunity presented by the 10-yearly redrawing of Congressional district boundaries to squeeze him out of his home constituency in the suburbs south of Atlanta, which he held by fewer than 1,000 votes in 1990. His Republican primary opponent, former state Assemblyman Herman Clark, has run a venomous campaign, with an echo of Mr Gingrich's own jibes at Congress. He has attacked Mr Gingrich for voting for a Congressional pay rise, and for alleged writing of unfunded cheques on the House bank and abusing Congress members' free mailing privileges. He even forced the Congressman to give up his chauffeur-driven limousine. Mr Gingrich's foes are chuckling to see him running a classic incumbent's campaign, flourishing at the voters his ability to bring money to the district from the federal pork barrel.</p>

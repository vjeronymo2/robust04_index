			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Monday Interview: The riddle of The Chairman - Jerry Rawlings, president of Ghana The World Bank may be surprised to learn that its model economic recovery programme in Africa is described as 'economic blah blah blah' by Ghana's president. Flight-Lt Jerry John Rawlings, 45, is more at home in the cockpit of a fighter-jet than articulating the principles of the structural adjustment programme which has been adopted across the continent. But, in spite of his apparent contempt for economic theories and intellectuals, Rawlings has not wavered in his political support for tough and often unpopular reforms. One of Africa's most dynamic leaders, Rawlings has ruled post-colonial Ghana, often uncomfortably, for the past 13 years - longer than anyone else. Since his first populist military coup in 1979 against a corrupt, army-led government, he has set Ghana back on the road to economic rectitude and political maturity - although not without abuses of human rights that he now refers to as 'mistakes'. He has had to confront the problems facing other parts of Africa in the 1980s: marginalisation, corruption, the fall-out from the end of the cold war and external and internal pressures for democratisation. Having presided over reform of the economy, 'JJ', or 'The Chairman' as he is known, now faces a challenge equally demanding: the transition from the authoritarian, often idiosyncratic era of military rule to a multi-party democracy, culminating in presidential elections in November this year. He is shy of publicity and foreigners and rarely gives interviews. But recently he spoke to the FT in his modest private quarters inside the whitewashed, 16th-century, Danish-built castle which is home to Ghana's presidents. The Chairman, in a checked plaid shirt, jeans and army-green Reeboks, railed against his familiar targets - the hypocrisy of the 'so-called ethics' of the US, the way the west has sponsored brutal African dictators like President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, and 'the greedy consumerist attitude of Europeans' which was destroying the environment. At times, he struggled to find the words for his emotional thoughts. But in an exceptional display of candour, he revealed the qualities which have made him popular. They include his acknowledgment of 'his own limitations', his plain speaking and an element of playfulness, revealed by his production of a huge tiger's claw he cut from a tiger's skin in an Ethiopian palace. To many, Rawlings is an enigma - a firebrand socialist who has pursued one of the continent's most widely praised free-market economic reform programmes, backed by aid from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Since 1983 he has backed a programme of devaluation, trade liberalisation, tight fiscal and monetary policy, and large reductions in the bloated bureaucracy. These policies have given Ghana an average real growth rate of 5 per cent a year, reduced inflation from an annual rate of 123 per cent in 1983 to 18 per cent last year, restored confidence and stimulated investment and the return of millions of dollars held overseas by Ghanaian nationals. Debt arrears of USDollars 600m were erased by 1990. Part of the answer to the Rawlings riddle lies in the fact that he has been shrewd enough to ensure that management of the economy, which he admits he does not fully understand, has been left to technocrats led by Dr Kwesi Botchwey, the finance minister, and including Dr Joe Abbey, the ambassador to Washington. 'They are workers but they like to call themselves advisors,' Rawlings jokes. He has also shown a political commitment to reform. Rawlings believes that in Africa the alleviation of poverty can be achieved only through a lean, free-market economy, backed, at least in the short-term, by western aid. Classical structural adjustment policies of devaluation, free-market liberalisation and cutting of subsidies have redistributed wealth and promoted growth. They have released state resources for education, health and infrastructure, and shifted the terms of trade in favour of rural farmers who make up most of the population. Rawlings said common sense dictated that he support economic reform. 'What we are aiming for is the humanising of capitalism . . . We have only done what is common sense to the ordinary person. Oppressed, poor people don't have to be told by foreigners and intellectuals about corruption, the price they have paid for their cocoa or bringing clean water to their villages.' This commitment to 'the people', combined with a reputation unsullied by charges of corruption, has made the programme one of the most successful in the continent. Rawlings' support for free-market policies, however, remains qualified, and he stresses that colonialism and the inequities of the international economic order remain powerful constraints on Africa's development. He also frequently lashes out at the west, complaining about the way Africa has become marginalised and 'ripped-off' by some foreign companies. Many question whether, with these views, Rawlings can deepen the limited successes of the reform programme, and move it forward to the next critical level. This requires a commitment to the private sector and foreign investment which would create self-sustainable growth without dependence on foreign aid. In three months Rawlings will return the country to civilian rule for a second time. So far, he has remained mute over whether he will be a presidential candidate. 'I have left it to God for guidance. That's what I tell the diplomats anyway,' he said, chuckling. However, having once before wrested the country back from an incompetent civilian administration, he hopes that Ghanaians will avoid being being badly served by politicians again. 'The people have become a lot more defiant. You can't fool the people any more with sweet promises. Thank God for it. The politicians would be better talking about the reality of hardship ahead which faces us, instead of trying to con people.' If Rawlings decides to run against as-yet undeclared opponents, he will face severe criticism of his human rights record, which includes executions, kidnappings, arbitrary detention without trial and confiscation of property. The Chairman admits that human rights abuses have been committed during the past decade, but he says he is genuinely sorry for past excesses. 'The humanity of our revolution is that the politicians can come back and smear us. In the French revolution, they were beheaded. Our crime is our humanity.' This humanity is best illustrated by his background and character, rather than by his erratic and flamboyant economic and political philosophy. He recalled his childhood on the streets of Accra, where he got into 'a lot of scrapes and whenever I heard a police siren my heart started pounding because I thought they were coming to get me'. During the interview, he prowled around his study, which has two televisions so he can get CNN, C-Span and watch videos about acrobatic and formation jet-flying, his first recreational passion. But his ferocity crumbled as he got up to hug his wife and children and listen to a little lecture from Mrs Rawlings about kicking his heavy smoking habit. Throughout his rule, he says, he has managed to make sure 'the office doesn't take away my personal freedom'. His bedroom is like a small workshop with tools spread out for building radio-controlled model aircraft. A punch bag hangs next to the dining table. He has made time for regular complex flying exercises, riding motorbikes and scuba-diving. Flying, he says, is the 'ultimate challenge' and 'anybody who does not enjoy these things does not get the best out of life'. If he stands and is defeated in the forthcoming elections, he says he will have to search for a job because 'I have no money'. But he says he might like to write a book on social psychology or become a preacher to continue his campaign against injustice.

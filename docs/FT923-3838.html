			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Directors' rises held down THE RECESSION has held down top management's base pay rises this year, according to figures published yesterday by Monks Partnership, the independent remuneration advisers. Rates of increase for the base salaries of main board directors fell from a median of 14.3 per cent for the year to July 1991 to 7.7 per cent during the present year to July, according to a survey based on data from more than 600 companies. Senior managers of parent companies below board level saw their salary rises decline from 9.3 per cent last year to 5.3 per cent this year. The rates of pay increases of subsidiary company executives also fell, although less dramatically. Mr Tony Vernon-Harcourt, managing director of Monks, said: 'If we consider what has been happening in recent months, top pay is no longer moving ahead faster than the pay of the workforce as a whole. We would expect differentials to narrow in times of recession.' Most companies, he said, were expecting pay rises for senior executives of about 5 per cent during the forthcoming year. Pay rises for senior managers have evidently fallen more sharply than those of the workforce generally, with government figures showing average earnings increasing by about 7 per cent in a similar period, compared with 9.2 per cent in the previous year. Performance bonuses are a main component of senior managers' pay packages, and those have also been restricted by the recession. During the past year, the survey finds, 43 per cent of parent-company chief executives and 42 per cent of the other main board directors who were eligible for a bonus did not receive one because corporate performance fell short of minimum target levels. That compares with 30 per cent and 33 per cent respectively for the year to July 1991. The proportion of eligible senior managers below board level in parent companies who failed to receive bonuses rose from 37 per cent to 46 per cent. Management Remuneration in the UK.

			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / International Company News: Skis Rossignol back in black SKIS Rossignol, the French company which is the world's largest ski equipment manufacturer, returned to the black in its last financial year. It produced net profits of FFr36.65m (Dollars 6.45m) in the 12 months to March 31, against a net loss of FFr53.95m the previous year. News of Skis Rossignol's return to profit came a day after the announcement of an increase in 1992-93 profits from Groupe Salomon, the other leading French ski equipment maker. Both companies are recovering from a succession of poor skiing seasons in the Alps. The growth in turnover would have been even higher - at 17.1 per cent - on stable exchange rates. Operating profits rose sharply to FFr142.89m from FFr11.45m between the two financial years.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Excerpts] Where is our hope? All Haitians who are lucky  enough to still be alive today, who have not been shot down, and  who have not been abducted by military or civilian police  auxiliaries must know the fundamental reason our country is  experiencing such a bad situation. What is now happening allows  everyone to clearly see that the criminal 30 September 1991 coup  d'etat was a master plot hatched by the imperialistic countries,  especially the United States and the bourgeoisie under the  command of the United States and its [word indistinct] Army,  which is always there to make [words indistinct] execute to the  letter all the orders of the United States. This is why nobody  should be surprised at seeing the unscrupulous Army and numerous  civilian police auxiliaries -- who are drug dealers, rapists,  assassins, and thugs -- have fun pitilessly assassinating those  who have decided for one reason or another to struggle against  this criminal and repressive system. [passage omitted]    The coup d'etat has taught the people a big lesson: Today,  the people know who are their friends and who are enemies, as  well as who the hypocrites are. If the people's enemies have put  them in a situation from which they cannot defend their freedom,  their rights, and their lives today, it is not because they have  resigned themselves. On the contrary, the people already know --  just like all other people on earth who are struggling for their  liberation -- that in all battles, there are good moments and  bad moments. Nobody will tell us that we are now experiencing  bad moments. We see how many people, who pretend to side with  us, have used those bad moments to harm us even further, to make  us suffer more. But we promise them one thing: We have a good  memory; we will never forget. The time has come for us to think  about the struggle for liberation, the battle for the true  democracy we need.

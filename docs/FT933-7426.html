			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Injecting extra fizz into its global ambitions - Cadbury Schweppes' Pounds 154m soft drinks move CADBURY Schweppes' Pounds 154.2m acquisition of a further 20.2 per cent stake in Dr Pepper/Seven-Up is widely regarded as only a preliminary move towards strengthening its position in the Dollars 47bn US soft drinks market. 'The deal shows that the group has recognised its weakness in the market. It does not, by itself, enable it to break through its limitations,' said one industry analyst. Cadbury's position in US soft drinks encapsulates its wider strategic problem. It has outgrown the UK, but not yet achieved the stature it needs to become a real force in the international league. Its overseas operations, encompassing some 170 countries, are widely but thinly spread. It is the leader in only a few, mostly Commonwealth markets. Though the world's third largest soft drinks producer, its 4 per cent share of the global market puts it well behind Coca-Cola and Pepsico. Schweppes and Canada Dry may be global brands, but most of its portfolio consists of niche products with limited mass market appeal. Similarly in the international confectionery business, it lags substantially behind Nestle and Philip Morris. Cadbury's argument that exploitation of profitable market sectors is more important than market leadership and scale has done little to allay concerns about its longer-term growth. The group's further investment in Dr Pepper/Seven-Up appears to many sceptics to promise a more realistic strategical approach. Cadbury first acquired a stake in Dr Pepper in 1986/87, and after the company's merger with Seven-Up in 1988 was left with a 5.7 per cent shareholding in the combined group. Dr Pepper/Seven-Up is the third largest US soft drinks franchiser and one of the fastest growing companies in the US carbonated drinks industry, lifting sales last year by 7 per cent in a total market that grew only 1.5 per cent. Sales of brands such as Dr Pepper and Seven-Up give it a 10.6 per cent share of the Dollars 47bn soft drinks market. Last year, the group reported operating profits of Dollars 160.6m on sales of Dollars 658.7m, and a net loss, after charges incurred in two aborted attempts to make a share issue in the US. Dr Pepper produces the bulk of Cadbury's soft drinks concentrates for the US market and acts as sales agent for some of its drinks brands in the food service sector. The alliance has made Cadbury the fourth largest soft drinks company in the US with a 3.4 per cent share of the market. Brands such as Schweppes, Canada Dry and Sunkist are distributed through more than 850 independent bottlers, and the operation also markets a range of juices. Mr Dominic Cadbury, chairman, said yesterday that he regarded the share acquisition as 'an excellent opportunity' to increase substantially the group's investment both in Dr Pepper and in the US soft drinks industry. Nobody believes that will be the end of the matter; that Cadbury will merely rest on its 25.9 per cent shareholding. The group signalled its intention yesterday of continuing discussions on 'further ways in which the two companies can co-operate to maximise their respective strengths.' Analysts believe there are only two ways forward if Cadbury is to get more competitive muscle out of its investment: a full-blown takeover of Dr Pepper or the injection of its brands into the company in exchange for additional equity. Cadbury and Dr Pepper have already discussed the terms of an acceptable standstill agreement on further share-buying by the UK group - and the talks will continue. Mr Dominic Cadbury denied that a full takeover plan lay behind yesterday's deal, but said he was ruling out nothing in the longer term. 'I would not rule out a further step in the future, but equally we have no plans for that. We're not ruling it in, we're not ruling it out.' Mr Cadbury showed little inclination yesterday to get involved in the management of Dr Pepper - and though Cadbury tried to buy the company in the 1980s, few involved in the industry believe a renewed bid is unlikely. 'Dr Pepper's management certainly does not want to surrender control of the company,' said one analyst. 'The price of a hostile bid for the remaining 75 per cent shareholding would be close to Pounds 1bn. Cadbury would need a rights issue to fund it, and with gearing already up to 80 per cent, that would cause some concern in the City of London.' The City would certainly feel easier if Cadbury, instead, were to inject its carbonate brands into Dr Pepper in exchange for cash and another slice of stock. Though Cadbury would cede management control, its long-term interests in the market, some analysts argue, would be better served by owning, say, 35 per cent of a company with a 14 per cent to 15 per cent share of the US market. The combination of brands would have more appeal to independent bottlers and give the operation greater competitive strength. It could also provide the foundation for developing the growth of Cadbury and Dr Pepper brands in tandem in other international markets.</p>

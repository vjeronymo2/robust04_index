			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLARED;  </P> <P> HONEST ESCAPEE WITH ABYSMAL TASTE IN CLOTHES PROMPTLY LANDS BACK IN JAIL  </P> <P> Perhaps, in retrospect, honesty was not the best policy as far as Edwardo Osuna  was concerned.  </P> <P> Osuna, 18, knocked on a Castaic resident's door Thursday night and asked for a  change of clothing, explaining -- truthfully -- that he needed new clothes  because he had just escaped from jail, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies  reported Friday.  </P> <P> The homeowner responded with a red T-shirt bearing the words "Suck 'em Up" --  giving Osuna such a distinctive appearance that he might as well have kept his  jail garb of lime green pants and shirt with the words "L.A. County Jail" on  the shirt back.  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies easily picked him out of a crowd at a fast-food restaurant  and put him behind bars again.  </P> <P> Osuna and Ismael Mendoza, 25, both serving short terms for narcotics  convictions, escaped from the minimum security lockup at the Peter Pitchess  Honor Rancho in Saugus.  </P> <P> Near midnight, a Castaic resident called the Sheriff's Department and said a  man had just knocked on his door and asked for clothes, admitting he needed  them because he had just escaped from jail.  </P> <P> The resident, who was not identified, gave deputies a description of the  clothes he gave the fugitive -- gray sweat pants and the distinctive T-shirt.  </P> <P> About an hour later, deputies spotted Osuna wearing that T-shirt as he asked  for a ride from people at a McDonald's restaurant on Lake Hughes Road and  arrested him.  </P> <P> Mendoza surrendered at the sheriff's station in Valencia at 11:30 a.m. Friday.  Both inmates were being held in the full security jail and will be charged with  escape, officials said.  </P></p>

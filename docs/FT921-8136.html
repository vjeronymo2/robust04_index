			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / International Bonds: Spain prepares for largest Euroyen deal SPAIN was last night preparing the ground for a Y125bn issue in the international bond market, with leading underwriting firms competing fiercely for the mandate. The proposed 10-year deal, which would be the largest Euroyen bond issue, is expected to be launched either this morning or tomorrow, if market conditions are favourable. The current Euroyen benchmark at the 10-year maturity is the World Bank's Y50bn issue, which was yesterday trading at a yield of 5.61 per cent. Belgium, which has a AA-1 credit rating, one notch higher than Spain, also has a Y50bn deal outstanding, trading at 5.75 per cent. Syndicate officials said yesterday that bonds issued by Spain should be priced to yield slightly more than Belgian ones, although the size and liquidity of the proposed issue could attract investors into the deal. Elsewhere, the European Investment Bank launched its anticipated Dollars 500m seven-year bond issue. The mandate to lead-manage the deal was won by Credit Suisse First Boston after a competitive bidding process. The firm agreed to underwrite the deal at a yield spread of 5.2 basis points more than US Treasury bonds, at the aggressive end of market expectations. In common with other recent EIB issues, the deal was not syndicated in the usual way. Just six other firms participated in the transaction at the invitation of the lead. The fees paid to underwriters by the EIB remained undisclosed, suggesting that the borrower had achieved a very low cost of funds by shaving underwriting costs to a minimum. Three of the participants were Italian banks, underlining that the bulk of the paper will be placed in Italy, where bonds issued by the EIB are exempted from withholding tax. The non-Italian firms in the deal reported some buying from Far Eastern and other institutional investors, but conceded that the appetite of Italian investors was crucial to the success of the deal at such a tight yield spread. By the close, the 7 1/8 per cent bonds were trading at 99.70 bid, from a fixed re-offer price of 99.786, where the yield spread was around 6 basis points over Treasury bonds.</p>

			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Computers in Finance (3): Light at the end of the tunnel - While operation of Taurus is at last in sight, ETC is moving rapidly ahead 'THE ABILITY to do a deal always runs ahead of secure settlement and the custody function.' This comment, from Mr John Griffin, director of business administration at GT, the fund management group, sums up the frustrations of trading in international equity markets. Capital may move more readily across borders, but the infrastructure needed to support such capital flows is still under development. The emerging markets of Latin America or Asia provide the biggest headaches. most have been concerned more with attracting foreign capital than with worrying about how to modernise their settlement and payment systems. The financial scandal that engulfed India this year is a direct result of an inadequate settlement system, although in the money markets rather than the stock market itself. The emerging markets are not alone. A number of more developed countries, among them the UK, still function on antiquated stock market settlement arrangements. The huge growth in financial markets in the 1980s prompted a concentration on 'front-end' trading systems, with too little attention given to automating what happened after a trade had been struck. Until these national systems have been revamped, links between domestic stock markets, making international securities investing easier, will remain a long way off. The slow progress on London's paperless system, Taurus, could soon yield results. After over a decade, the system has at last entered the early stages of testing and is scheduled for some time from next September onwards. But while London enters the final lap in the development of Taurus, it is worth remembering that at least one back-office activity is being automated with the minimum of fuss. Trade confirmation is one of the main steps in the process that starts with a stock market trade and ends with cash and shares changing hands. Confirmation of the details of a trade usually travels by telex or fax. At the end of 1991, a group of investment institutions, led by Fidelity, the Boston-based fund management group, decided the process should be automated. Just a year later, electronic trade confirmation (known as ETC) is a reality. Two systems, developed by the London Stock Exchange and Thomson, have been launched, while a third, from the International Securities Markets Association, is due before the end of the year. All conform to the same standards and links between the three are planned for next year. It is all a far cry from Taurus. Leaving aside the scale and technical complexity of each project (Taurus is in a league of its own), the comparison is instructive. Taurus is a political compromise, designed to square the conflicting demands of its many users - brokers, registrars, banks, investors and listed companies. No wonder that each of these groups has at times sounded unenthusiastic about the final design: you can't please all of the people all of the time. ETC, on the other hand, is a solution to a specific problem, prompted by a particular group of financial institutions. There is no whiff of political compromise about the project - custodian banks, who have asked to be admitted to the system, have so far been left on the outside. The first priority is to complete the system and get it accepted by brokers and investors, says Mr Chris Smith of Fidelity. That involves building the links between the three competing systems, and extending the concept around the world (the initial ETC project is intended for investors in Europe). Another big difference is that Taurus represents an attempt to use technology in order to preserve the status quo, while ETC looks ready to overturn it. Taurus was designed in many ways to mimic the existing structure of the share transfer system. Registrars, for instance, retain a central role, maintaining details of shareholdings for the vast bulk of shareholders (they will become known as 'company account controllers'). Only when rolling settlement comes into operation - when all stock market trades are settled a set number of days after they have been agreed, probably five - will the nature of share settlement change markedly. The extent to which ETC alters the relationships between stock market participants is difficult to predict. Ostensibly, the system is being built to serve a limited function, replacing existing communication methods with a more efficient one. However, by putting institutional investors on the same communication network, it could in theory provide the basis for greater direct contact between them, in the process by-passing traditional stock market intermediaries such as brokers and custodians. This is the clearest example so far of the way in which technology is changing the boundaries between different intermediaries in the securities markets. Meanwhile, Taurus seems at last to be within reach. Barring unforeseen technical problems, the biggest threat to the successful implementation of Taurus is the attitude of listed companies. Each company must ask its shareholders' permission to 'dematerialise', or make the switch to the new system. Enthusiasm has been lacking on the part of listed companies for the system so far - fears that Taurus will make it more difficult to identify the beneficial holders of a company's shares have not subsided. Many also believe that, after all the delays, the technology will have to prove itself before companies make the switch. Marks &amp; Spencer has been the most open in voicing this sentiment, but others feel the same. 'I sense a reluctance,' says Mr John Watson, the Taurus project director. 'Companies are saying 'we can't see it and touch it'. That's an inevitable reaction - but it's one we are gradually overcoming, I think.' The reluctance of companies to join could extend the phase-in period of Taurus, leaving the City in the expensive position of running an electronic settlement system and, in parallel, the existing paper-based one. That will eventually leave listed companies paying larger bills for share registration, says Mr Watson. 'Companies need an effective registration sector - and they're putting it's costs up.' It will be a great irony if, having struggled for so long to get agreement on and then build Taurus, the Stock Exchange fails to persuade many listed companies to use it.</p>

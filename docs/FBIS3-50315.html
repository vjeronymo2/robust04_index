The Slovak Foreign Ministry originally intended that the  agreements be signed during Kovac's current visit to Poland.  That they will not be signed represents no change of policy,  Kovac said. Most of the series of agreements will be signed in  the first quarter of 1994, Kovac said. He added that a meeting  of the two countries' cabinets was being prepared.    Kovac said that a proposal to completely open the common  border was spontaneously brought up during his Warsaw talks,  which he considered an expression of great interest in extending  Slovak-Polish relations. However, this question is linked to  readmission agreements, and control of foreign citizens and  goods must be preserved. The opening of the border should only  concern citizens of the two countries.    Kovac said that it was necessary to analyze the interests of  the individual countries of the Visegrad Four (the Czech  Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia) and prepare further steps  to develop mutual cooperation. There are specific questions,  such as the Partnership For Peace plan, which cannot be solved  bilaterally and need a joint line, he said. "When four say the  same thing separately at various places, it is different from  their speaking with one voice," Kovac said. However,  cooperation within the Visegrad Group cannot replace bilateral  relations, he noted.    Kovac also met with President of the Polish National Bank  Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz, who said that the creation of a  Slovak-Polish bank was not being considered. However, some  Polish bank could take up the assignment. The bank will be  chosen by the Polish minister for foreign cooperation, she said.</p>

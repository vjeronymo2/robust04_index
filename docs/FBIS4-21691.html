			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  editorials carried by ROK vernacular newspapers on 2 April  commenting on the UN Security Council's adoption of a  president's statement on the North Korean nuclear issue.    The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word  editorial entitled "Aftermath of the President's Statement."    The editorial first describes the president's statement as  the "first stick," because the statement contains the UN  Security Council's "clear will" to demand that North Korea  receive nuclear inspections. The editorial adds that North  Korea must know it will be a "loser" if it thinks it still has  time to "maneuver." The editorial writes: "If North Korea  continuously uses its nuclear card, the international community  will become more and more wary of North Korea. North Korea  must be trustworthy if it wants economic cooperation with the  international community. North Korea has given rise to nuclear  suspicions and, thus, tarnished its image. This is tantamount  to destroying a basis for economic cooperation."    The editorial continues that it is time the government  sincerely goes through a reexamination, writing: "It must no  longer be lured by optimistic or romantic approaches."    The moderate TONG-A ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word  editorial entitled: "Aftermath of the UN Security Council  President's Statement."    The editorial first advises that North Korea "will not  ignore" the statement on the grounds that the statement is  nonbinding. The editorial then asks North Korea to "pay  attention to" the UN Security Council recommendation that  North-South negotiations be resumed to implement the joint  denuclearization declaration.    Referring to the U.S. media report that it is all right even  if special envoys are exchanged during or after the DPRK-U.S.  talks, the editorial writes that "this idea will only satisfy  North Korea, which pursues a policy of thoroughly excluding  South Korea from all negotiations." The editorial finally asks  the ROK Government to "maintain consistency" in dealing with the  North Korean nuclear issue, instead of running about in  confusion.    The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word  editorial entitled: "UN Security Council Statement."    The editorial writes that as a result of the adoption of the  statement, the "ball is again in North Korea's court." It says:  "It is clear that the UN Security Council will seek the adoption  of a resolution on sanctions against North Korea if North Korea  does not receive nuclear inspections. Therefore, time will not  always be on the North Korean side. Because North Korea's  efforts to indefinitely resist the pressure has its limits, it  must know that the sooner it decides to receive nuclear  inspections and resume North-South dialogue, the more beneficial  it will be."    The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN carries on page 3 an  800-word  editorial entitled: "It is Time China Persuades North Korea To  Receive Nuclear Inspections."    The editorial first expresses its discontent over China's  excessive protection of North Korea regarding the nuclear issue  and refers to China's responsibility for this issues. It  writes: "China preferred the adoption of a statement, a moderate  approach, at the UN Security Council, while insisting on  dialogue, and our country and the world accepted China's idea.  Therefore, complying with the spirit of the statement, China  must persuade North Korea to accept the international  community's demand before the UN Security Council resumes  deliberations and adopts a resolution on sanctions."    The editorial concludes: "North Korea will not be able to go  scot-free [musa halsu opta] without ensuring nuclear  transparency. It would be wise to accept the UN recommendation  and China's persuasion."    The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN carries on page 3 an  800-word editorial entitled: "Government's Chaotic `Solution' to  the Nuclear Problem."    The editorial first describes the chaotic situation  regarding  the North Korean nuclear issue due to the ROK Government's  frequent changes in policies. Referring to U.S. Secretary of  Defense Perry's remarks that the United States would prevent  North Korea from developing nuclear weapons even if it requires  that the United States wages another war on the Korean  peninsula, the editorial asks who will pay the price for such a  war. Commenting on the government's position that the statement  will express the international community's view on the North  Korean nuclear issue to North Korea, the editorial asks the ROK  Government to solidify its basic policy on the North Korean  nuclear issue.</p>

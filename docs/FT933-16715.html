			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / BBC Enterprises doubles its profits SALES ARISING from programmes such as Michael Palin's Pole To Pole and Noddy helped BBC Enterprises double its profits last year, Raymond Snoddy writes. Before tax and interest Enterprises made Pounds 11.8m in the year to April. It made Pounds 5.6m in the previous year. The commercial wing of the BBC was able to contribute Pounds 60m during the year - Pounds 7m more than last time - to the making of new television and radio programmes. This amounts to almost Pounds 3 for every licence payer. Mr James Arnold-Baker, chief executive of Enterprises, said yesterday: 'Although the recession continued longer and deeper than predicted, BBC Enterprises had some outstanding hits during the year.' Pole to Pole, the story of Michael Palin's journey from the North to the South Pole, was seen in more than 20 countries. The hardback book of the series has sold 500,000 copies and the video helped make BBC Video the top video label in the UK. 'In all areas of our business we have built on the reputation of BBC programmes to develop multi-media marketing opportunities,' Mr Arnold-Baker said. In children's programmes Noddy also had the multi-media treatment with the animated series being backed up by a range of books, video and audio tapes, a fortnightly magazine and a range of licensed toys. All the proceeds of Enterprises go back into BBC programme making.</p>

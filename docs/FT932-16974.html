			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report GOLD and precious metals were generally easier on the London bullion market on light profit-taking after Wednesday's rush of excitement. Charts indicate that the time is right for gold to break out into a higher range, possibly with an upside target of Dollars 344 a troy ounce, according to dealers. 'But there will be a lot of resistance,' said one. Heavy overhead supplies are still a factor, but the ease with which the market absorbed sales has been impressive. BASE METALS mostly remained steady on the LME, with stability in dollar contracts reflecting the weakness of the dollar in currency markets. Three-month ZINC remained boxed in a Dollars 5 range with an earlier move down to four-week lows of Dollars 995 a tonne finding expected support. The subsequent recovery failed seriously to test resistance above Dollars 1,000. COPPER was bolstered by its ability to hold above Dollars 2,160 support. London's robusta COFFEE futures ended with severely pared gains after a short covering rally which followed the breakdown of ICO talks on Wednesday was seen to be overdone. Compiled from Reuters</p>

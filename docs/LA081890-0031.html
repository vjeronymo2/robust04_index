			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY IS ONE THING, BUT GIVE FANS SOME GOLF  </P> <P> In the Viewpoint letters Aug. 11, Sandy Cohen stated that the media had blown  the Shoal Creek situation out of proportion and that a more urgent need was to  " . . . educate young blacks so that they can get better jobs and economically  have their own private clubs."  </P> <P> Perhaps even more urgent is the need to educate whites, both young and old, so  that there will be no more private clubs like Shoal Creek.  </P> <P> WILLIAM M.

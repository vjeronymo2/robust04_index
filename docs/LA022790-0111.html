			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> FIRM TO HELP WEIGH HIGH-SPEED RAIL BIDS  </P> <P> An Anaheim engineering and consulting firm has been selected by the  California-Nevada Super Speed Train Commission as one of five companies that  will evaluate bids for building and operating a 300-m.p.h. rail system between  Las Vegas and Anaheim.  </P> <P> Willdan Associates has been selected, along with corporations from Southern  California, Nevada, Colorado and Canada.  </P> <P> Proposals to privately build and operate the train system are expected from  Bechtel International of San Francisco, Morrison-Knudsen Co. of Boise, Idaho,  and Bombardier Corp. of Canada.  </P> <P> The bistate commission is scheduled to choose a proposal in October.  </P> <P> Construction is scheduled between 1993 and 1997, although skeptics have said  the train system cannot be built for the $4-billion estimated so far.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Anaheim City Council on Tuesday will discuss giving the  commission $200,000. Although state law mandates that the train be privately  financed, public funds may be used in developing the project.  </P> <P> The commission's executive director asked the city for funding this year to  help identify the most attractive contractor for the job.  </P> <P> Las Vegas and Clark County, Nev., are expected to give $85,000 each to the  commission this year, and the Las Vegas Convention/Visitors Authority is  expected to provide another $250,000.

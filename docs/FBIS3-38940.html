			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Eduardo Mascarenhas report: "Army Closer to NATO"] </F>   [Text] The Defense Ministry is studying the possibility of  incorporating the Portuguese mainland territory into one of the  NATO areas. The Army advocates turning Cinciberlant [Commander  in Chief, Iberian-Atlantic Area] into an integrated command, and  has in mind assistance for infrastructures. The United States  will be looking at Tancos.    Madeira and the Azores are the only Portuguese territories  formally coming under both a national and a NATO military  command. Their respective integrated commands answer to the  Armed Forces chief of staff, who appoints them, and the  Cinciberlant, who in turn comes under Saclant -- Supreme Allied  Commander.    As far as the mainland territory is concerned, there has  recently been a situation of dichotomy. The Iberlant command,  which from the setting up of the alliance's military structure  held responsibility only for the territory's maritime defense,  has for several years had an Air Force "antenna," and forms the  link with Saceur -- Supreme Allied Commander, Europe -- as far  as air defense is concerned. Defense of the "ground" remains a  wholly national responsibility, which is not the case for any  other member of the allied military structure on this side of  the Atlantic.    The alliance treaty says that an attack on any one of the  member countries is an attack on all of them, but it also states  that the defense of their respective territories is primarily a  national responsibility. That is, it pledges assistance, but in  terms of "reinforcement." All the European countries in the  allied integrated military structure are covered by plans to  that effect, and the forces assigned to each of them are known,  except for Portugal. And for a simple reason: They do not  exist, despite Portugal's having units assigned to the ground  defense of its allies (the Separate Mixed Brigade and the  Airborne Brigade).    Portugal, a founder of the alliance which has always been a  member of its integrated military structure, thus finds itself  in a situation almost comparable with that of France and Spain,  which, not belonging to that structure, have introduced into it  the idea of a "NATO a la carte."    The situation stems from the strategic stance adopted by  Salazar (to be in it, without being in it...), which, in a  scenario of a limited to the integrity of the mainland  territory, had two other instruments: The Iberian Pact and the  ZIC [expansion unknown] Agreement, which linked Madrid and  Washington, was in force until Spain's entry into NATO and  envisaged an operations area which covered Portugal. The  situation is also partly a result of the Army's involvement in  Africa from the beginning of the sixties.    Today, following the experience of taking part in meetings  at  the headquarters of Saclant (Norfolk), under which the Azores  and Madeira come, and the increasing presence in NATO's command  bodies in Europe, the Army has "woken up." It advocates the  mainland territory's incorporation into a NATO command. It also  advocates that Cinciberlant, which currently has air-sea  characteristics, be turned into an integrated command in the  "full" sense of the term.    NATO's new military structure has already been redesigned.  NATO's Atlantic command experiences no changes; the Channel  command, which used to cooperate with the European command with  respect to air defense, disappears; and it is in the  last-mentioned command (Allied Command Europe) that changes are  noted, as well as an increase in Britain's responsibility in the  northern areas. The center command (Commander in Chief, Allied  Forces, Central Europe) acquires responsibility for air defense  over the Baltic. This structure has already achieved consensus  in NATO but is not yet official. In allied military circles, it  is maintained that the Portuguese initiative, if it  materializes, is unlikely to be taken into account now, owing to  the delay with which it comes about.    In Portugal, the last word will rest with the government,  and, in particular with the defense minister, under whose aegis  studies are taking place. In advocating the mainland territory's  incorporation into one of the NATO commands, the Army has in  mind not so much the assigning of allied forces for its defense  as securing financial assistance for infrastructures such as the  bases of Sao Jacinto or Tancos, which it has just received from  the Air Force and where it has installed the new Airborne  Brigade.    "Why should the Italian command, under which the brigade  comes for NATO purposes, benefit from all the assistance? Why  does use of the brigade have to pass previously through Italy?"  an Army general asked, talking to DIARIO DE NOTICIAS. In that  officer's opinion, the mainland territory's incorporation would  make it possible not only to secure funds to which the Army does  not have access at present, but also for Portugal to be viewed  in a different light in the alliance, owing to a "total  presence."    However, according to a well-placed source, there are those  at the Defense Ministry, whose minister has not yet made a  pronouncement, who maintain that the initiative could help  destabilize the traditional Portuguese geostrategic position in  the transatlantic axis. It is asserted there that the solution  to the Army's needs could be found in another way: The United  States will certainly be looking at Tancos in the framework of  its plans for the forward defense of its own interests.</p>

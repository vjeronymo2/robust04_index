			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / George Michael's counsel sings the Sony blues MR Justice Jonathan Parker is not the sort of judge who asks: 'Who is George Michael?' First, because the singer was sitting in front of him in the High Court in London yesterday, clad in black T-shirt, black suit and designer stubble, listening to his counsel argue that his contract with Sony should be declared unenforceable. Second, Mr Justice Parker, 55, would not play the game. Mr Mark Cran QC, George Michael's lawyer, came up with enough pop icons to stump a dozen high court judges, but Mr Justice Parker nodded knowingly. Madonna, Elton John, even Holly Johnson of Frankie Goes to Hollywood - he knew them all. Mr Cran said the singer's last few years had not been easy. His contract has not made him as rich as some people thought. In the five years to the end of 1992, George Michael's gross profits were a mere Pounds 7.35m. Sony's gross profits from his recordings for the same period were Pounds 52.45m. The singer's profits were calculated after he had met recording costs himself, as required by his contract, but before he had paid his accountants, or - Mr Cran expressed regret - his lawyers. George Michael had four barristers to represent him, including two QCs. The second QC was Mr Jeremy Lever, who had come to argue that the contract was in breach of European competition law and should be declared void. This would result in the copyright to George Michael's songs being returned to him. Time ran out before Mr Lever's turn came, so he spent the day puffing on his Biro as if it were a stress-reducing accessory. Mr Cran's job was to argue that the contract represented an unreasonable restraint of trade and should be declared unenforceable. Its duration was particularly onerous. Although it ends, in theory, in 2003, Mr Cran argued that it could continue for longer, as George Michael would be liable for damages if he had not delivered the six albums still required by his contract. An additional injustice was that Sony could reject albums if it was dissatisfied with their contents. Mr Cran said this gave Sony the right to make a subjective decision about artistic quality. It would be difficult for a court to question that judgment. 'That's very true,' Mr Justice Parker said, acknowledging a rare musical limitation. George Michael had decided he wanted to be a serious musician rather than a sex symbol. Sony had not given him support. His fans did, though. Dewy-eyed, they sat in the public gallery, one in a recklessly low-cut blouse, ready to endure hours of argument for their serious musician. Most did not budge as Mr Cran explained the workings of withholding tax. The few who left paused to bestow upon their idol a look of tender solicitude. As well they might; the case is likely to continue for 12 weeks.</p>

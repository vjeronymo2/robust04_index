The second minister for defense, Dr. Lee  Boon Yang, said the new patrol craft will be equiped with  state-of-the-art command, control, and communications system.  They will further enhance the Navy's fighting and civil defense  capabilities.    Dr. Lee said for the first time in Singapore Navy's  shipbuilding program, all the phases of design, construction,  and system integration are carried out locally. The patrol  vessels will be designed and built by the Singapore Shipbuilding  and Engineering, a subsidiary of Singapore Technology. Dr. Lee  was speaking at the launch of the Navy's second mine  counter-measure vessel, RSS [Republic of Singapore Ship] (Kalau)  at the Singapore Shipbuilding and Engineering yard at Tuas. The  vessel is one of the four mine counter-measure vessels Singapore  has ordered from Sweden.</p>

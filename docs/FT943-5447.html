			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Markets: Building for a confusing future - The Bottom Line The conflicting signals from the housing market must be as daunting for Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, as they are for equity investors and home-owners. Should Clarke decide to raise interest rates, he faces the problem of doing so without denting weak consumer confidence and derailing the UK's economic recovery. Investors, meanwhile, are wondering if building shares have over-reached themselves. And owners - particularly those hit by negative equity, where the value of their property is less than that of their mortgage - are worrying that the upturn may never come. Broadly, the picture is that sales of new houses are rising briskly but those of old ones are not. Unless these pick up, the market for new housing is likely to run out of steam as well. But many people are afraid that any rise in interest rates - or even the threat of it - may stop potential buyers taking on new mortgage commitments. And occupiers are reluctant to move, anyway, while prices remain so sluggish. Housebuilders' profits are likely to rise sharply over the next 18 months as they use up the expensive land they bought late in the 1980s and early 1990s, and as sales incentives are reduced. But the much slower recovery in the general housing market has restricted sales of building materials for repair, maintenance and do-it-yourself work. In the past these have risen in line with a general improvement in house sales. Half-year figures this week from construction and building material companies confirmed this broad picture. It was emphasised by house price statistics from the Halifax and Nationwide building societies which showed that prices are still struggling to rise. Persimmon, the country's eighth largest house-builder, reported on Wednesday a 34 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 11.3m. Sales of new homes, which had dipped in June and July, bounced back in August, according to chairman Duncan Davidson; indeed, they were a quarter higher than during the same month last year. Some of the increase will have come from the company selling more development sites as it pursues its ambition of raising output from 2,771 homes last year to 4,000 a year by the mid-1990s. But other builders have also reported higher August sales. Normally this would bode well for September and October, traditionally good months for house sales. These months have been blighted in the past two years, though - first, when Britain left the European exchange rate mechanism in September 1992; and then in autumn last year as potential buyers stayed out of the market during the run-up to the November Budget, the first at that time of year. Many builders are concerned that sales could again be affected this September and October by fears of interest rate rises, although Davidson believes the recovery is now solid enough to withstand a small increase. Persimmon, meanwhile, increased the net profit it made on each sale in the first half to Pounds 7,818 from Pounds 4,825 in the first six months of last year. This compared with a peak profit per house of Pounds 18,000 in 1988-89. The company aims to get this back to Pounds 10,000 a unit in the next 18 months. Rugby, which this week announced a 17 per cent rise in first-half pre-tax profits to Pounds 35.6m, said UK cement sales overall had risen by 8 per cent. But purchases of bagged cement, sold for mainly small works, had fallen slightly. More worryingly, the company warned of price competition in the UK joinery market which, unlike other building material sectors, did not reduce capacity during the recession. For equity investors, the conclusions may be that house-builders and their material suppliers, particularly those which have cut capacity and are able to contain prices and margins, are performing best. The recovery, however, is slow and modest and most of the virtues have been reflected already in these companies' share prices - in spite of this week's flurry of price increases for builders prompted by the August sales boost.</p>

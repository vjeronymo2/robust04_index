UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] spokesman Major Bill Aikman  told a press conference late Sunday (13 February] that 13 Serb  and five Bosnian Army weapons had been handed over to UNPROFOR  during the day after a 24-hour break in the disarmament process.    The Serbs handed over two 100 mm cannon, two 155 mm cannon,  a  122 mm mortar, six 82 mm mortars and two multiple  rocket-launchers, Aikman said.    The mainly-Moslem Bosnian army for its part dismantled and  placed under UN control a 75 mm anti-aircraft gun, two others of  75 and 37 mm, and two 82 mm mortars. [passage omitted]    The ceasefire entered its fourth day midday Sunday with only  a "small number of violations," Aikman said, adding 15 shells  were fired in the city in the last 24 hours. [passage omitted]    Meanwhile in Zagreb Yasushi Akashi, UN Secretary General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali's special representative in Bosnia, stressed  the air strike threat applied to all three of Bosnia's warring  parties.    Speaking after meeting Sunday with UN and NATO commanders to  coordinate possible implementation of air strikes, Akashi said  that, in the event of bombardments being ordered, NATO would  carry them out "against whichever party was violating the  ceasefire."    UNPROFOR's Bosnia commander General Sir Michael Rose, who  attended the meeting, added that many of the truce violations  registered in Sarajevo had been carried out by Bosnian  government troops.

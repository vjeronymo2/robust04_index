			<p>BFN     [Text] Speaking to newsmen in Jakarta today, Hun Sen,  second prime minister of Cambodia, reiterated that the Phnom  Penh government will not hold further negotiations with the  Khmer Rouge [KR] because it has used all the topics discussed  between the two sides at past talks as a platform to support its  existence.    He said the failure of the talks between the Phnom Penh  government and the Khmer Rouge faction in Pyongyang recently was  due to the fact that the Khmer Rouge put forward proposals that  did not totally lend support to the integrity of Cambodia. The  Khmer Rouge asked for self-rule, which is impossible for the  Phnom Penh government to accept.    Meanwhile, on a separate occasion, Prince Ranariddh, first  prime minister of Cambodia, reiterated the Phnom Penh  government's wish to open a Cambodian Embassy in Jakarta as soon  as possible. According to Ranariddh, this will intensify  efforts to step up bilateral economic and trade ties with  Indonesia. He said that the Phnom Penh government has worked  out several incentives to attract foreign investment in Cambodia.</p>

			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Fleeing investors force Taiwan to rethink economic blueprint: The KMT's need to show results this year see it curbing both its ambitions and its regulations FOREIGN investment in Taiwan fell by 43 per cent in the first half of this year, while domestic investment was down to just 20 per cent of GNP, much lower than in South Korea or Japan. An overloaded infrastructure and high cost of living can be blamed in part for the falls. But the government may also have been caught between political over-ambition and over-rigidity in its regulation of the economy. Only 15 per cent of investment in Taiwan in 1991 was in manufacturing, while the service sector expanded rapidly. The trend is disturbing for the island's Nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) government, which has relied on a Dollars 300bn (Pounds 150.7bn) infrastructure plan and new legislation to attract investment and maintain economic growth - currently just below 7 per cent. But rising costs and the appreciation of the Taiwan dollar are damaging Taiwan's low-cost manufacturing industries, whose exports fuel the island's economic growth. Many companies are moving to mainland China and south-east Asia, where development is less stringently regulated and labour is cheap. The exodus has resulted in the increasing movement of capital overseas - up to Dollars 5bn is estimated to have flowed into China since Taiwan eased restrictions in early 1991. It has also affected export growth, which has slowed in recent months. Mr Lee Kao-chao, director of research at the cabinet's Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) admits there is a problem. But the CEPD's blueprint for economic growth, the six-year development plan, has failed to be the panacea the government promised. Delays and insufficient budgeting are already forcing the government to cut back the plan's 770 projects and related bond issues. Economic analysts criticise the plan as an exercise in propaganda, while a recent report from the Chung Hua Institute for Economic Research estimated that without a re-think, the government would have to issue Dollars 252bn in debt by the year 2000. Apart from the financial burden, the risk of triggering further inflation would be high. 'If the government attempts improvements on this scale all in one jump it will be as big a flop as the Great Leap Forward was on the mainland,' said one senior member of the Institute. He added that until Taiwan's economy becomes more efficient, with fewer government-made obstacles to the flow of capital, resources such as the island's Dollars 86.6bn in foreign exchange reserves will remain untapped. In an attempt to break the vicious circle between overloaded infrastructure and a poor investment environment, the government is extending low interest loans and tax holidays to almost any company that is in the black, while helping businesses with problems such as land acquisition for development projects. The cabinet's development fund has an apparently flexible budget of billions of US dollars, but observers say too much of this money is finding its way into property speculation and mainland China's stock market. Mr Wu Ruo-yu, of the independently funded Institute for National Policy Research, says that tighter legislation is the only way to prevent this kind of abuse. The framework for financial liberalisation has moved on apace in the past year: 15 new private commercial banks have begun operating in what was once a public-sector domain; new financial instruments, including a futures market, have been authorised, and investment by foreign individuals in Taiwan's stock market came one step closer with the first issue of global depository receipts in May. Liberalisation has put many of Taiwan's underground operations out of business, but many foreign investors have criticised the government for shooting itself in the foot with over-zealous regulation. In a crackdown on illegal foreign labour, quotas were imposed and new rules set in an apparently arbitrary manner. 'The only thing investors have to watch out for in Taiwan is the government,' said one foreign businessman affected by the new rules. With another construction bond issue to be cancelled in September, it seems that the KMT's political vision has in some measure given way to economic reality. But with parliamentary elections looming at the end of the year, the KMT cannot afford to have nothing to show for its economic promises, either. Taiwan's exports to mainland China leaped 38.9 per cent to Dollars 2.84bn in the first half of 1992, and two-way trade through Hong Kong totalled Dollars 3.4bn (Pounds 1.7bn), a rise of 34 per cent over the same period of last year, writes Luisetta Mudie. Raw materials and textiles accounted for 36.4 per cent of exports and industrial machinery and electronic goods 11 and 10 per cent respectively. The growth in trade is causing alarm in Taiwan's government, which fears economic dependence on the rival Beijing regime. Direct trade links have yet to be established across the Taiwan Strait, but already 7.13 per cent of the island's exports reach the mainland.</p>

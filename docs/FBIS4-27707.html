			<p>Division--Investing   Postal Savings', Supporting PKO   <F P=102> 11111111 [15 Feb 94 p 2] </F> <F P=103> 11111111 </F> <F P=104>  [15 Feb 94 p 2] </F>  CSO     With a 180 trillion yen balance on account, postal savings  make up 30 percent of all individual savings and deposits  nationwide. The job of the Fund Operation Division is to invest  these funds and to provide for their repayment to depositors and  savers.    This is not to say the MPT has the entire amount to invest.  Once customer deposits are transferred to the Fund Operation  Department of the Ministry of Finance, most of it is lend to  government-related financial institutions or used to underwrite  government bonds. Only the remainder is available for the  Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications to invest at its own  discretion. These funds are called "financial deregulation  countermeasure funds" [hereafter, "response funds"] and can be  borrowed from the Fund Operation Department to be invested by  the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications.    Estimates for fiscal 1993 place the total amount of postal  funds on deposit with the Fund Operation Department at 10.4  trillion yen; about 4.75 trillion yen will be returned to the  MPT as response funds. Of the outstanding balance, approximately  180 trillion yen at the end of fiscal 1993, about 25 trillion  yen is expected to be invested by MPT at its own discretion.    Kiyoshi Mori (Class of 1973) assumed the head post in the  Fund Operation Division in 1992. A veteran in the  telecommunications field, this is his first assignment in the  Postal Savings Bureau, but he is proving to be an able leader,  bringing fresh, new ideas into the division. When entering the  division, one's eyes are drawn to a magnificent dealing room in  the back. At meetings convened at 0830 every morning, dealers  exchange information with each other, including their views on  the previous day's activities and trends on foreign markets.  They then begin their day's work. There are 16 dealers. Often  the division receives advice on investments from organs  affiliated to the ministry like the Postal Savings Fund Research  Association--a collection of "investment pros" who are on loan  to the association from various securities firms.    About one-half of all response funds which are targeted for  investments are put into government and regional bonds. These  funds are also invested in corporate bonds, bank debentures, and  foreign bonds. Again, of the funds placed in designated unit  investments, which are handled by trust banks via the Postal  Life Insurance Welfare Corporation (an affiliate of the MPT),  some are directed into stocks.    Designated unit investments fall into one of two categories:  "new designated units" place no restriction on the amount that  can be invested in stock ([unit] investments in fiscal 1993  amounted to 500 billion yen); "old designated units" limit such  investments to 30 percent of the total ([unit] investments in  this case amounted to 450 billion yen in 1993). There has been  no indication of what percent of the division's investments have  gone into the stock market, nor what issues were bought. All one  is told, according to Chief Mori, is that the division's  "investments are undertaken with the objective of maximizing  profit returns to the [depositor]."    One thing that has been said about "public funds" like  postal  savings deposits, however, is that they have played an important  role in maintaining stock prices through the government's PKO  (price-keeping operation) policy. Nor does there seem to be an  end to speculations circulating on the market about the Fund  Operation Division.  <H5>  [17 Feb 94 p 2] </H5>   [Text] MPT Post Office Life Insurance  Bureau/Operations and Planning Division--Racking Brains To Come  Up with a New Product    The Post Office Life Insurance Bureau's Operations and  Planning Division seems to have a counterpart in private  enterprise: it is responsible for developing new products. In  this case, a new insurance plan with new coverage terms and new  incentives to join. Staff launches a new product every year  after coordinating its efforts with government organs like the  Ministry of Finance.    The work of coordinating its plans with the Ministry of  Finance progresses in tandem with the ministry's work to draft a  new fiscal budget. The outcome of the division's "battle over  the budget" this time was mixed. "We lost one round and won a  round," says Division Chief Itsuo Ooyu. The round he and his  staff won was over a plan to increase annuity payments when the  annuitant became bedridden. The round they lost was about a new  endowment plan that would pay the insured a one-time, lump-sum  payment at the time of childbirth. This plan was rejected by  MOF. During the past several years, the Operations and Planning  Divisin has been on a winning streak, and in April 1992, the  enrollment age for regular old-age insurance was raised from 65  to 70; in April 1993, insurance payments for insurees under  special contract were raised; and from January 1994, a combined  educational endowment and scholarship annuity plan was started.    For its part, the MOF has maintained: "there is no need for  a  large-scale revision of products every year." Chief Ooyu (Class  of 1972), whose area of specialty is operations and systems, is  an old hand in the Insurance Bureau. When the issue of  establishing an endowment plan paying a lump-sum at the time of  childbirth came up, he said he felt the MOF people had dug in  their heels and wouldn't budge. "Private insurance was  experiencing a slump," he says, "and the ministry had put up its  guard with respect to trying to come out with a stronger  product."    Again, with regard to raising the upper limits for insurance  payments (currently set at 13 million yen), it was decided to  put the proposal on the back burner for awhile. "We felt it  would be useless to try to push it this year," says Ooyu, "so we  didn't push it to start with." While he agrees, "the role of the  Operations and Planning Division is to strive to respond to  subscriber needs," there seems to be a sense within the division  that every possible new product has already been thought up, and  staff seems to be at a loss for any new ideas.    A new unit, the Financial Deregulation Response Office, was  set up within the division in June 1991 to respond to reforms in  the insurance system. Unlike the Financial Deregulation  Promotion Office (in the Postal Savings Bureau), which is busy  dealing with the deregulation of interest on current deposits,  the Response Office, according to Ooyu, "isn't yet sitting in  the hot corner.'" Because MOF's insurance reform hasn't gone  very far yet, things are still in the state of preparation.  <H5>  [18 Feb 94 p 2] </H5>   [Text] MPT Postal Insurance Bureau/Fund Operation and  Planning Division--Postal Insurance Funds, Free To Invest the  Entire Lot    Postal insurance funds, said to total 65 trillion yen (as of  the end of fiscal 1992), are different from postal savings and  deposit funds in that the entire amount can be invested by the  Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MPT] at its own  discretion. The unit which decides on the investment plan is the  Postal Insurance Bureau's Fund Operation and Planning Division,  which is also involved in reforming the insurance fund system.  The actual responsibility for investments falls to First and  Second Fund Operation Divisions.    One finds that close to 60 percent of all insurance funds as  of the end of fiscal 1992 went to financial investment and loan  institutes and local public entities as loans or toward the  purchase of bonds. Thirteen percent also went into the purchase  of corporate bonds, bank debentures, and foreign bonds and  another 11 percent was invested in stocks and bonds by way of  designated unit investments, which were made by trust banks on  behalf of Postal Life Insurance Corporation, an affiliate of the  MPT. The chief of the Funds Operation and Planning Division,  Michihiro Fujioka (Class of 1975) took up his current post last  year after heading the First Fund Operation Division. When it  comes to investing postal insurance funds, he is said to have a  "feel for the lay of the land."    For actual investments, advice is sometimes sought from PI  Investment Consultants, a consulting firm that was established  in 1993 through funding of the MPT's affiliates. The firm is  staffed by personnel on temporary loan from trust banks    Operation of the life insurance funds include designated  unit  investments, which are attracting a lot of attention because of  their association with government efforts to maintain stock  prices through a PKO (price-keeping operation). Through fiscal  1993, investments in designated units amounted to 7.62 trillion  yen. In fiscal 1994 there are plans to add another 1.5 trillion  yen.    With system reforms slated to take effect next fiscal year,  the MPT has attempted to ease the burden on Postal Life  Insurance Corporation and, for a certain portion of designated  unit investments, has revised rules governing the makeup of  portfolios. This revision is the outcome of constant, ongoing  negotiations between Fujioka and the Ministry of Finance. At  this stage, of all This revision is the outcome of constant,  ongoing designated unit funds, 50 to 60 percent are slated for  stock investments. "With system reform," says Fujioka, "we will  have the kind of environment that should facilitate stock  investments." He adds, he would like to "raise our stock  investment ratio."  <H5>  [23 Feb 94 p 2] </H5>   [Text] MAFF Economic Affairs Bureau/Agricultural  Cooperative Division--Helmsman for Agricultural Cooperative  Administration    As the troubles of housing loan companies, carriers of large  amounts of nonperforming loans, continued to surface during the  summer of 1992, concern spread among financial institutions that  were affiliated with the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and  Fisheries [MAFF] who were also providing housing-related loans.  The group involved in hammering out measures to respond to the  crisis together with the Ministry of Finance and Bank of Japan  was MAFF's Agricultural Cooperative Division. The division  oversees Agricultural Cooperative Credit Unions, who have been  having a hard time since the collapse of the bubble economy.    Agricultural cooperatives are organized on three levels: on  the local level, there are the Individual Municipal Agricultural  Cooperatives; then, there is the Prefectural Credit Federation  of Agricultural Cooperatives; and finally, the Norinchukin Bank.  The Agricultural Cooperatives Division is in charge of the  Municipal Cooperatives and the Prefectural Credit Federations.  Back in the era when Agricultural Cooperatives were operating in  a stable environment, the position of division chief was  considered to be a relatively light-weight one though, in fact,  the calibre of men who have held this post since 1980 has been  on the order of division chiefs like Taichiro Okawahara  (currently a Diet man in the lower house), who rose to the rank  of vice minister. In any case, the situation for agricultural  cooperatives these past several years has completely changed.    In addition to a succession of ill-fated securities  investments, agricultural cooperatives are carrying housing  loans in excess of 6 trillion yen--a situation which has weighed  heavily on shoulders of the division. Thus, a special  "inspector's office" has been set up within the division to  provide inspections of agricultural cooperatives. A succession  of able young men have also been assigned to the division to  take the helm. Included are former division chief Yoshio  Kobayashi (Class of 1973) and Hiroyuki Kinoshita (1971), who  currently heads the division.    "Because of the self-help nature of cooperatives," says  Kinoshita, "government agencies haven't intervened very much in  their affairs." But with financial deregulation and the  government's decision to liberalize the rice market, "the  agricultural industry is at a major turning point in its history  and," he stresses, "there's bound to be an understandable  distance between us in our positions on some issues."    An immediate task is to restructure the corpulent  agricultural cooperative organizations. But the idea of merging  the Prefectural Credit Federation with the Norinchunkin Bank and  thus just having a simpler, two-tiered structure consisting of  the central bank, on one level, and the individual municipal  agricultural cooperatives, on another level, is moving forward  very slowly. When will legislation to promote the merger of the  Prefectural Credit Federation and Norinchukin Bank be put before  the Diet? The question comes down to the ability of those at  the helm of the agricultural cooperative administration.  <H5>  [24 Feb 94 p 2] </H5>   [Text] MAFF Economic Affairs Bureau/Finance  Division--Directing, Overseeing Strategy of Norinchukin Bank    A subject that has elicited a lot of talk is the  diversification strategy of the Norinchukin Bank. A giant among  institutional investors, the Nochukin moves some 40 trillion yen  belonging to the agricultural cooperatives. Last year, it formed  a securities subsidiary and later a subsidiary investment trust  company. Also moving right along are preparations to issue  "preferred investment securities," which will come from a broad  base of funds. Directing and overseeing this strategy is MAFF's  Finance Division.    The division is in charge of overseeing and providing  direction to the Norinchukin Bank as well as the Agriculture,  Forestry, and Fisheries Finance Corporation and Agriculture,  Forestry, and Fisheries Credit Found, which are two  government-affiliated financial institutions. In preparing for  the liberalization of rice, the division bears an important role  in agricultural administration in such matters as creating a  low-interest loan system through the Norinchukin Bank and the  Agriculture Finance Corporation. Top executives of the  Norinchukin Bank and government-affiliated financial  institutions have traditionally come from the "former officials"  circle of Agriculture's vice ministers. The Finance Division  must also serve as a pipeline between this fraternity of vice  ministers and Agriculture's top bureaucrats.    Those assigned to the head position in the Finance Division,  then, are on an elite course within the ministry. Not a few vice  ministers have taken this course, including Sakue Matsumoto  (currently chairman, Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries  Industrial Technology Conference), Fumio Watanabe (Ibaraki  Prefecture Governor) and Yoshihiro Hamaguchi (chairman, BRAIN  [Bio-Oriented Technology Research Advancement Institute]). The  executive ranks also include people who once served as Finance  Division chiefs like Economic Bureau Chief Takeki Manabe (Class  of 1963). "At the very least, the elite course will lead to a  bureau chief's post somewhere within the ministry.    According to Fumio Tahara (1972), the man who currently  heads  the division, "agricultural cooperatives are in a period of  unprecedented change." With the bubble's collapse, profits are  tight on the local cooperative level as well as on the  prefectural level among the credit federations. The third-tier  is also having a tough time. According to Tahara, "the  Norinchukin Bank is faced with its own investment problems." But  the same sense of crisis felt by banks and securities firms  still hasn't filtered down into the cooperatives--a fact which  is making government policy difficult. Says Tahara, "They have  to be more realistic, and be ready to respond to change."  <H5>  [25 Feb 94 p 2] </H5>   [Text] MOF Banking Bureau/General Affairs  Division--Financial Administration's "General Manager"    On 8 February, the day the government announced its 15.25  trillion yen economic stimulus package, Toshiharu Kitamura  (Class of 1969), General Affairs Division chief in the Ministry  of Finance's Banking Bureau, read his carefully prepared report  titled "Administrative Guidelines Concerning the Nonperforming  Assets of Financial Institutions." The guidelines, intended to  bring stability to the financial system, include recommendations  for more flexibility with regard to non-tax exempt write-offs,  improving the liquidity of interest-exempt credit and giving  assistance to financial institutions planning to merge. The  report is the work of the General Affairs Division, the Banking  Bureau's "general manager."    The General Affairs Division is the general managing unit  for  monetary and fiscal administration and is subdivided into a  number of smaller units. The "general affairs desk" manages  general administrative matters concerning the various divisions  within the Banking Bureau. The "correspondence desk" handles  Diet-related correspondence and documents and contacts with  other bureaus. The "planning desk" is involved with plans and  proposals related to policy matters in general, and the "Bank of  Japan desk" manages bureau matters related to the central bank.  Thus, the General Affairs Division sees a wide range of incoming  intelligence on financial matters.    Understandably, the division chief's position is a very  important one, and not a few of its alumni have been considered  suitable candidates for the Banking Bureau's head post.  Kitamura, an old-hand in the Banking Bureau, was promoted to his  current position as division chief last June. He is known in  financial circles as a conscientious, hard-working official and  has earned the trust of his immediate supervisor, Banking Bureau  Chief Nobuyuki Teramura (1961).    Masamichi Kono (1978), a planning official, is Kitamura's  assistant and had a central role in putting together the  administrative guidelines for dealing with nonperforming assets.  He was also Kitamura's chief assistant when Kitamura headed the  Banking Division, and the two again teamed up to cope with the  crisis that has followed the collapse of bubble economy.    The Financial Markets Office is also under the jurisdiction  of the General Affairs Division. The office was created as a  small unit in June 1989, but its importance is growing as a  "window" for negotiations with the Ministry of Posts and  Telecommunications. Besides attending to the regulation of  interest rates on savings and deposits following changes in the  official discount rate, the office has recently been involved in  negotiations regarding the deregulation of interest on floating  deposits, one of the final steps in the deregulation of interest  rates.    Two separate positions are being taken with regard to the  deregulation of interest on floating deposits. On the one hand,  financial institutions in the private sector maintain that  interest on regular postal savings accounts should follow the  lead taken by interest on regular bank deposits. The Ministry of  Finance supports this stance. The Ministry of Posts and  Telecommunications has opposed it. To get the two sides to come  together will likely be a test of the negotiating skills of  Toyonari Sasaki (1976), the man (formerly with the Small Banks  Division) now in charge of the Financial Markets Office.  <H5>  [1 Mar 94 p 2] </H5>   [Text] MOF Banking Bureau/Banking  Division--Garrisoning a Broad Territory, Division Is Busier Than  Ever    The "MOF man in charge." This broad appellation, a popular  reference to the men in the Ministry of Finance [MOF] who are in  charge of supervising private financial institutions, covers  everything from policy to personnel matters. Most frequently,  one finds these men in offices of the Banking Division. Because  they cover a broad territory--city banks, regional banks,  long-term credit banks, and trust banks--they travel many  different roads.    As a supervisory agency of the government, the Banking  Division has to understand everything of importance about the  banking industry, from the profit situation of individual banks  and the operations of branch offices to their various management  plans. Although no longer its responsibility, the amount of  nonperforming loans that banks are saddled with, a figure which  each bank is now responsible for releasing on its own, was also  the Banking Division's job to tally up and report.    "It has gotten so that I don't have any time to sit down and  talk leisurely with the desk chiefs or division chief's  assistant," says the MOF man in charge of city banks. A veteran  in this field, he seems astonished at how busy the Banking  Division has gotten recently. It means work for the "MOF man in  charge." For city banks, the overriding interest at this time is  entering the securities field through subsidiary companies. But  in consideration of the effect such moves would have on the  operations of existing securities firms, the idea of putting  limits on the number of such banks entering the field has taken  very strong hold. Given this situation, the Banking Division's  intentions in its negotiations with the Securities Bureau  becomes very important information to have. Another is MOF's  response to the nonperforming loan problem. There are, in fact,  "a mountain of things" one would like to ask these MOF men.    The division chief of Banking, Toshiyuki Tsukazaki (1970),  has an unusually wide circle of contacts in the financial world  even for someone in the Banking Bureau. During his days as chief  of the Research Division, he was involved in drafting the  Financial System Reform Bill, which recognized the idea of banks  and securities firms entering each other's turf through  subsidiary companies, and as chief of the Small Banks Division,  was involved in drafting a proposal for the restructuring of  housing loan companies.    Yoji Ninomiya (1975) is in charge of matters concerning the  overseas activities of banks. He was promoted from his position  as an assistant to the division chief to his current post as  division planning official in view of the impact BIS agreements,  such as those concerning capital-to-asset ratio requirements,  would have on the operations of the banks. Also commanding some  urgency are regulatory groundwork and preparations regarding the  introduction into Japan's banking system of netting contracts to  settle mutual obligations.  <H5>  [2 Mar 94 p 2] </H5>   [Text] MOF Banking Bureau/Special Banks  Division--Administrative Guidance, The Dilemma of Public Versus  Private    The Banking Bureau's Special Banks Division often receives  faxed "requests" from politicians. They are almost always a  request that special consideration be given to a supporter  seeking a loan from one of the government-affiliated financial  institutions.    The Special Banks Division's main work is to provide  supervision and guidance to government-affiliated financial  institutions, including the Japan Development Bank, the  Export-Import Bank of Japan, and the Housing Loan Corporation.  Since these are government-affiliated institutions, politicians  seem to think all they need to do is ask and something can be  done. But, in fact, says Special Banks Division Chief Kazuto  Nishikawa (Class of 1971), "it's impossible to go around  intervening in individual cases."    The role of government-affiliated financial institutions is  to provide long-term, stable funds at a low interest in areas  where the private sector response has been inadequate. In other  words, these loans are merely meant to supplement private  efforts. Because of the government's economic stimulus package,  however, public loans are assuming an increasingly larger share  of the loan market. Criticism is also growing in the private  sector about "the pressure government enterprises are putting on  private industry."    "There is a lot of misunderstanding in such criticisms,"  says  Nishikawa. Because private lending is stagnant, government  activities have come more noticeably to the fore. But, says  Nishikawa, "that doesn't mean we've gone too far with government  lending." "What would have happened to Japan's economy if we  didn't have these government-related activities?" he asks,  convinced of the answer.    On the other hand, an unusual situation has developed over  the past several months. Government-affiliated financial  institutions raise funds using the interest from government  investments. These funds are then loaned out with interest.  Since last November [1993], however, the long-term prime rate  has fallen substantially, and the basic interest on their loans  are now higher than those of private lenders.    This time, critics are charging that, with their higher  interest rates, "there's no reason to have public loans." The  Special Banks Division thus seems to be caught "on the horns of  a dilemma," wedged in between these critics and the fiscal  authorities who decide the interest on public investments. As  fiscal system reform moves forward, the place of public loans  will also be under reconsideration. That seems to put the role  of the Special Banks Division at a strange crossroad in time.  <H5>  [3 Mar 94 p 2] </H5>   [Text] MOF Banking Bureau/Small Banks Division--Back  Stage Maneuverings in Troubled Times    During the past several years, the financial sector has been  shaken by a series of events--the dissolution of Toyo Credit  Bank, the liquidation of Kamaishi Credit Bank, to name just two.  Many nonbanks have also undergone management restructuring.  According to a Ministry of Finance official, "In each of these  cases, the private financial institution has accepted the  principle of self-responsibility and have dealt with the problem  on their own initiative." Among the majority of those closely  involved in such incidents, however, the consensus seems to be  that the Small Banks Division played a very strong role.    To the degree that strong management skills are needed for  such a job, the division chief's position is commonly said to be  one of the ministry's more difficult posts. Historically, it  seems to have been the place where high-achievers with a lot of  experience behind them in the Budget Bureau have come to test  their financial skills. Like his predecessors, the current  division chief, Atsuo Saka (Class of 1970), has the reputation  for being an achiever and is also one of those who have come out  of the Budget Bureau. He has also worked in the office of the  Private Secretary to the Minister of Finance.    The Small Banks Division supervises regional banks, credit  unions, and credit cooperatives. Regional fiscal authorities and  prefectures have direct supervisory jurisdiction over the credit  unions and cooperatives, but the Small Banks Division also has a  detailed grasp of their operations, including their  profitability and management plans. Given the apparently weak  management structures of many regional financial institutions,  it seems that reorganization will continue to be a problem for  awhile, and the division can expect to receive an increasing  number of calls for consultation.    Nonbanks, which have an outstanding loan balance totaling  100  trillion yen, are supervised by the Financial Companies Office.  The Ministry of Finance lacks the same supervisory authority it  has by commercial statute over nonbanks as it exercises over  banks, securities firms, and life insurance companies. Because  the real estate backed loans of the bubble period have turned  into nonperforming assets, causing concern about the stability  of the financial system, the ministry set up this office in July  1992. Today, the unit has a staff of six members, who are  responsible for matters concerning nonbanks, money-lenders,  backed securities, prepaid cards, commodity investments, and  special credits.    Office chief Takashi Matsumoto (1976) is only the second  person to have filled the post. He has had many years experience  working in the Budget Bureau, and was also head of the  Department of Planning and Development for Kumamoto Prefecture.  Among other things, he is currently studying how to increase the  liquidity of interest-exempt assets, which are used by  special-objective firms.  <H5>  [4 Mar 94 p 2] </H5>   [Text] MOF Banking Bureau/Research Division--Fiscal  Administration's Think Tank'    It was the Research and Investigation Division that handled  the desk work for the Financial System Research Committee, an  advisory body to the minister of finance. It was the division  that worked together with the Banking Bureau to come up with  recommendations the idea of allowing banks and securities firms  enter each other's turf. This idea forms one of the pillars of  financial system reform. Its staff of eleven, though relatively  small in size, serves as the Banking Bureau's "think tank."    Now that the first stage of financial reform has been  completed, the division is tackling the task of defining the  direction and the role of financial administration in the  post-bubble years. The focus of their inquiry, taking into  account the materialization of nonperforming loans and the  failure of a succession of financial institutions, asks how such  problems might be controlled and eliminated in the future. Last  autumn, the division formed the Commission to Investigate Basic  Problems, a subgroup under the Financial System Research  Committee, which it has now begun deliberations.    In January 1994 several commission members, including  Tetsuro  Nishizaki (an international management consultant), and Research  Division Chief Toshio Muraki (Class of 1972), went abroad on a  two-week study tour, visiting the United States, England,  France, and Germany to study financial administration in each of  these four countries. They are planning to put together their  findings sometime around June [1994], indicating the future  direction for financial administration as it pertains to Japan.    According to Muraki, "While businesses and service fields  are  being deregulated, there are tougher regulations now on the  level of government supervision." In his opinion, the trend is  toward tougher administrative regulation.    The division also serves as staff for the Commission to  Investigate Basic Problems, as well as the desk work for a task  force working on disclosure and a special committee on  electronic banking (EB). The disclosure task force reconvened at  the end of March [1994] to begin an inquiry into what kind of  information is needed to to reflect off-balance transactions. In  the EB committee, members will be looking into regulations  regarding electronic transactions by financial institutions.    The ways things stand, securities firms, through their  subsidiary companies, may enter areas that were exclusively the  domain of banks before. From this summer [1994], however, the  division will be reconsidering some areas, including matters  such as the "fire wall" [banning exchanges of information about  customers] between parent and subsidiary companies and limits to  the type of business or services subsidiary companies may engage  in.    The head position in the Research Division, often filled by  young men on a seniority basis, has become another "gateway to  success" within the Banking Bureau. One of those who passed  through this gateway is Masaaki Tsuchida (1959), who after  becoming Banking Bureau chief, went on to head the National Tax  Administration Agency.  <H5>  [8 Mar 94 p 2] </H5>   [Text] MOF Banking Bureau's Insurance  Department/First Insurance Divivion--Change Urgent for Life  Insurance Guidance Under Adverse Trend    Management of the insurance companies is facing a  crossroads.  While fund operations is become increasingly difficult in view  of the historically low interest rates, participation by  individuals has stalemated and earnings opportunities are  declining. At the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks which  ended in a rupture, the opening of Japan's insurance market  became an debating point.    Even Satoshi Nishikawa (MOF class of 1971), who was  transferred from director of the Second Insurance Division with  jurisdiction over casualty insurance companies to director of  the First Insurance Division in charge of life insurance  companies and is well-versed in both life and casualty  insurance, says: "No one could possibly predict such changes."  The mainstay and small and medium life insurance companies are  faced with the consequences of a sharp decline in hidden stock  profits and the high yield in mass volume during the bubble  economy, and business operations have deteriorated markedly.  Director Nishikawa calls for an awareness reform among managers,  saying: "In the future, management premised on improved earnings  will not be possible."    In addition to granting business licenses to life insurance  companies, the First Insurance Division issues permits for new  commodities and services. It also periodically checks  operational content and provides guidance on fair methods for  the use of assets and accounting processes. Given the complex  and specialized knowhow necessary for insurance computation to  determine premiums, two "accountant officials" are assigned to  the division.    A momentous task of insurance system reform awaits the  insurance industry. The core consists of approving mutual entry  between banks and securities through insurance company  subsidiaries, and combined business operations by the main life  and casualty insurance companies in the three areas of injury,  disease, and nursing-care, in addition to deregulation formulas  to determine insurance premium rates. In July 1993, a research  office was established within the Insurance Division to perform  the enormous task of completely revising the Insurance Industry  Law written in the "katakana" syllabary. A revision bill is  scheduled for submission to the ordinary Diet session in 1995.    Kimio Yamaguchi (class of 1967), director of the Insurance  Department, has served in principal the MOF posts including  budget examiner in charge of Agriculture and Forestry and  director of the MOF Secretariat's Audit and Planning Division.  Although this is his first assignment in the Insurance  Department, he is evaluated highly for his sound management.  <H5>  [9 Mar 94 p 2] </H5>   [Text] MOF Banking Bureau's Insurance  Department/Second Insurance Division--In the Forefront of  Casualty Insurance Management and General Consultation    The six months from last fall to February 1994 was an  unusually busy period for the Second Insurance Division of  Insurance Department, Banking Bureau. The insurance talks at the  Japan-U.S. economic framework conference, centering on the  Second Insurance Division, eventually ended in a "rupture" at  the Japan-U.S. summit on 11 February [1994]. However, Director  Toyomi Takimoto (MOF class of 1972) who was in the forefront  appears disappointed about the breakdown in negotiations,  saying: "Except for the numerical targets, it was generally  possible to reach an agreement."    The Second Insurance Division is in charge of guidance and  supervision of the casualty insurance industry. Concretely, its  main duties consist of licensing casualty insurance businesses,  approving insurance commodities, and overseeing assets operation  and accounting procedures by casualty insurance companies.  Liaison with companies is indispensable, and responsible MOF  officials constantly visit officials of the Second Insurance  Division.    The Second Insurance Division has stood in the forefront of  the First Division which handles life insurance whenever  framework talks are held because the United States has presented  priority demands for expansion of entry by foreign companies  into the field of casualty insurance. For example, it has  demanded introduction of the "broker system" which will have a  major impact on casualty insurance companies. Director Takimoto  and his aides have found it necessary to travel to the United  States almost monthly since September and to spend virtually all  their energies in overall discussions.    From Japan's standpoint, there are many "unreasonable"  points  in the U.S. demands. For example, 12 states have not inducted  the broker system in the United States. Also, regarding cancer  insurance which is dominated by U.S. insurance companies, it  seeks to defer discussion of liberalization of the so-called  "third area." The situation was reportedly one of "saying  whatever one pleases."    However, many portions in the U.S. demands overlap with the  insurance system reform currently under study by the Japanese  side. The Second Division director expects a future reopening of  negotiations and says: "Understanding by the U.S. side will  definitely be won through steady progress toward system reform."    The overall discussions on insurance system reform has  somewhat delayed due partly to a shortage of time. The zeal of  casualty insurance companies has reportedly cooled down due to  the burst of the bubble economy. Much is expected of the prowess  of Director Takimoto who was present during the financial system  reforms as a councilor of the Cabinet Legislative Bureau.  <H5>  [11 Mar 94 p 2] </H5>   [Text] MOF Minister's Secretariat/Research and  Planning Division--Dual Role of "Brain" and Policymaking    The Research and Planning Division has two aspects. One is  the role of an economist group that performs analyses of the  economic situation as an MOF think-tank. Its other role is in  serving as hands and feet of deputy vice minister for policy  coordination and drafting the government's economic policies.    The government's economic policies were undertaken twice by  the Research and Planning Division since Tadashi Iwashita (MOF  class of 1970) became director: once in September 1993 and once  in February 1994. Drafting the government's economic policies is  responsibility of the Economic Planning Agency [EPA]. However,  because public works investment is centered on economic stimulus  measure such as expanded government spending and tax reduction,  the MOF ultimately becomes the center of policymaking.    The Research and Planning Division serves as the window in  consultations with other ministries and agencies. It is also the  division's duty to persuade the other divisions within the MOF  and to draft economic measures as centerpieces of the MOF. It is  often caught in a dilemma between the other agencies and the MOF  bureaus. Regarding the general economic measures in February  when deregulation was one of the centerpieces, an executive of  the Research and Planning Division was seen complaining: "It was  very difficult to find an effective deregulation measure."    In economic policies, monetary measures form the other wheel  of the cart with fiscal measures. It is also the Research and  Planning Division that is consulted by the MOF as its window  when the Bank of Japan [BOJ] raises or lowers official discount  rate. Therefore, it constantly exchanges views with the BOJ on  the economic situation.    Researching and analyzing the economic situation is also an  important task of the division. It utilizes the MOF's unique  data and other statistics to perform independent analyses such  as analyzing the detailed quarterly corporate statistics  surveyed by the Research and Statistics Department of the  Institute of Fiscal and Monetary Policy within the MOF.    In addition to about 10 analysts who conduct survey on  economic trends, there are specialists who are in charge of  commodity prices, money supply, and employment following in  detail the indicator trends and backgrounds in their specific  fields.    As a division that drafts policies, elite officials have  successively served as its director. Among former officials  include Yoshihiko Yoshino (MOF class of 1953), governor of the  Japan Development Bank, who also served as administrative vice  minister and Toshio Osu (MOF class of 1959), director of BOJ,  who served as director of the Financial Bureau. Among the  current directors, Masami Ishizaka (class of 1963), director of  Financial Bureau, and Takatoshi Kato (MOF class of 1964),  director of International Finance Bureau, have served as head of  the Research and Planning Division.  <H5>  [15 Mar 94 p 2] </H5>   [Text] MOF Secretariat's Financial Inspection  Department/Control Division--Checking Problems of Travel and  Operations    "Out on business trips two-thirds of the year." The lengthy  period of business trips for inspectors in the Financial  Inspection Department of the Minister's Secretariat who inspect  operations of financial institutions is unparalled within the  MOF. Trips to inspect regional banks outside of the capital  (Tokyo) region sometimes last more than a month each. There is  no impressive layout of policy nor is the work easy. However,  the department is truly a pillar of financial administration.    The Inspection Department was moved from the Banking Bureau  to the Minister's Secretariat in July 1992. Following the  exposure of the so-called securities scandals involving  compensation of huge losses by securities companies, the MOF's  posture was also questioned. Before that, the need for  independence of the inspection sectors located within the  Banking Bureau and the Securities Bureau respectively was  pointed out. The reason was that "unclear" aspects existed such  as the internal toleration of unsound trading pointed out by the  inspection sectors.    As a result, the sector for inspection of securities and  exchange became independent as the Securities and Exchange  Surveillance Commission-- an external bureau of the MOF, while  the Inspection Department of the Banking Bureau and the sector  for inspection of operational problems within the Inspection  Division of the Inspection Bureau were merged and moved to the  Secretariat.    The Banking Inspection Department is divided into the  Control  Division and the Examination Division. The Finance and  Securities Inspectors Office exists within the Control Division,  and finance and securities inspectors in the office conduct the  actual inspections, with an average of five to seven inspectors  assigned to a team. The inspectors from the main ministry cover  city banks, long-term credit banks, trust banks, and regional  banks including secondary regional banks, in addition to  large-scale securities companies. The credit associations and  small-scale securities companies are inspected by the Financial  Bureaus in the respective regions.    The Control Division is also in charge of general affairs of  the Banking Inspection Department and sets up inspection plans  such as deciding the order of inspections of financial  institutions. On the other hand, the Examination Division checks  the post-inspection reports submitted by inspectors and the  notifications of inspection findings to the financial  institutions that point out items to be supplemented or  corrected.    In addition to its inherent role of checking inspections,  the  Examination Division examines items submitted by the  institutions for approval of tax-exempt depreciation of bad  debts and issues depreciation certificates. The number of  requests submitted for debt depreciation has risen sharply with  the increase of bad debts, and the work of the division has  expanded incomparably. Amid the progress in liberalization, the  work of the Examination Division seems likely to change both  qualitatively and quantitatively.  <H5>  [16 Mar 94 p 2] </H5>   [Text] MOF Securities Bureau/Coordination  Division--Role of Drafting Deregulation Policy    The Securities Bureau accomplished its internal role of  securities deregulation with ad hoc economic measures in  September 1993 and supplemental deregulation measures in  December 1993.    Director Akira Yamamoto (MOF class of 1969) decribes the  division's role as "a thankless job of underpinning support."  The scope of its precautionary support is broad and includes not  only personnel and accounting but also general coordination  among the bureau's divisions. Recently, it has also taken over  the explanations given to coalition administration's Diet  members concerning securities-related tax revisions and  formulation of the Securities Bureau-related interpellations and  replies with the Diet in mind.    The Research Office within the Coordination Division handles  work related to finanical system reform. It performs the role of  the Secretariat for the Securities and Exchange Council [SEC]  and also the role of reviewing long-term problems of the  securities and exchange system.    The office is currently undertaking revision of the  Securities and Exchange Law, concerning "report on the  improvement of a securities system in conjunction with  deregulation of the acquisition of own-company stocks" the SEC  issued in February 1994.    The deregulation of own-company stock acquisition is "aimed  toward increasing options for corporate finance and enhancing  the freedom for the securities and exchange system" (Yoshio  Okubo, office director, MOF class of 1974). On the other hand,  drawbacks accompanying purchases of own-company stocks such as  insider trading are predicted. To prevent this, new rules will  be instituted including regulation of insider trading,  procedures for open buying, and methods for display of  stock-acquisition information.    It is advancing its operations with an eye on the trend  toward revision of the Commercial Law now in progress by the  Justice Ministry. With smooth sailing, the revised law should be  enacted in the current Diet session and the new system shoud  start by the spring of 1995.    A major event will also take place this year. Annual general  meeting of the IOSCO [International Organization of Securities  Commissions] will be held in Asia (Tokyo) for the first time in  October 1994. A Preparation Office was also installed within the  division early this year. Representatives of some 100  organizations from about 60 nations will come to Japan. Expected  to take place on an unprecedented large scale, planning official  Tadashi Kamimura (MOF class of 1977) and his secretarial staff  will be extremely busy.  <H5>  [17 Mar 94 p 2] </H5>   [Text] MOF Securities Bureau/Securities Market  Division--Building an Environment for Issue and Secondary Markets    In July 1992 with the reexamination of securities  administration sparked by securities scandals as a turning  point, the "Secondary Market Division" and the "Capital Market  Division" were merged and inaugurated. The principal roles  include overseeing the "issue" and "distribution" of securities,  promoting a sound environment including the legal aspect of fair  and efficient market operations and seeking revitalization of  the market.    One example is last year's reopening of the market-price  issue of stocks and public subscription of capital increases.  Being suspended since April 1990, capital procurement through  the stock market, which is the representative function of the  capital market, had stopped; however, Director Takashi Fujiwara  (MOF class of 1972) says: "We could not leave the conditions as  they were; therefore, we improved the environment to enable  resumption of blue chips that are attractive for investment and  could lead to revitalization of the stock market." This month,  capital for Japan's jumbo DPE [express delivery services] was  increased as a first case, and concrete moves are expected to  continue in the future.    Meanwhile, the Public and Corporate Bond Market Office  within  the division will conduct reexamination and abolition of  existing regulations and practices concerning the issue and  distribution of public and corporate bonds, and promote market  improvement.    Although the importance of corporate bond issues as a fund  procurement means for the companies has increased, the ratio of  corporate bonds in the market distribution is still low compared  to national bonds. Therefore, efforts are made to attempt  "improvement of the secondary market in order to diversify  capital procurement means" (Director Kenjiro Suzuki, who entered  the MOF in 1974).    In a recent case, a step was taken in April 1993 to ease the  "optimum bond criteria" that must be met when issuing corporate  bonds. The removal of the ban on the issue of five-year  corporate bonds in September 1993 as a deregulatory step may be  seen as an example. Since November, a total of four companies  have made offerings. In October 1993, the environment improved  with the removal of the limit on corporate bond issues under the  revised Corporate Bond Law.  <H5>  [18 Mar 94 p 2] </H5>   [Text] MOF Securities Bureau/Corporation Finance  Division--Improving Rules for Disclosure Information    The importance of disclosing corporate information is  strongly stressed. The reason is that, in order to bring back  and protect the investors who have left the stock market, it is  necessary to accurately inform them of the risks that face the  issuing companies. The Corporation Finance Division of the  Securities Bureau is in charge of matters concerning disclosure,  such as the formulation of rules for disclosure.    The division's Planning Office is in charge of managing the  Corporate Accounting Council, which is an advisory organ to the  finance minister. The council drafted a report in June 1993 to  seek better disclosure of leased property. In the future, the  focus will be on reexamination of foreign currency-denominated  trading and off-balance (extra-ledger) trading.    The division also serves as the window for the Japanese  Government's formulation of "international accounting  standards." The standards are set by the International  Accounting Standards Committee, which is a group of accountant  organizations from various nations. Given the deep interest  among the companies that procure capital in overseas markets,  high expectation is held toward the division's coordinating  capability.    Concurrently, the division provides listings of companies to  the nation's stock exchanges and checks the financial and  accounting contents of the companies listed over-the-counter at  the Securities Industry Association based on securities and bond  reports. If window-dressing settlements and unclear account  manipulations are discovered, the companies will be asked to  correct them and will be reported to the Securities and Exchange  Surveillance Commission which has prosecuting authority.    The audit corporate industry--the watchdog group of  corporate  finance--also has a supervisory role. It conducts qualification  examinations for certified public accountants; names of the  successful applicants will be posted on walls of the division's  corridor.    Yoshiaki Niihara (MOF class of 1972), director of the  Securities Bureau, is new to the bureau. He served successively  at the embassies in Belgium, Luxemburg, and France and is  well-versed in international finance.  <H5>  [23 Mar 94 p 2] </H5>   [Text] MOF Securities Bureau/Securities Companies  Division--Responsibility of Supervising Securities Companies  Questioned    Scandals involving securities companies continue to surface.  Cosmo Securities which incurred huge losses through illegal  "tobashi" [stock shuffling] trading was given relief through a  merger with the Daiwa Bank in August 1993. Recently, Kankaku  Securities incurred losses of about 50 billion yen through  similar stock shuffling and is expected to receive operational  support from The Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Ltd. Demands are  beginning to be heard concerning the supervisory responsibility  of the Securities Companies Division of the Securities Bureau  which controls securities companies.    The Securities Companies Division has a major impact on the  securities industry. Ever since the securities industry moved  from the notification system to the licensing system during the  1965 recession, the division has checked the operations of  companies through licensing as its weapon. In case a securities  company creates a scandal, it is the Securities Companies  Division that determines the content of punitive measures. The  Kankaku Securities Company's stock shuffling case was handled by  Director Akihiko Matsutani (MOF class of 1970) who interrogated  President Yoichiro Kato, and the activities of the Business  Department at its corporate headquarters was suspended for two  weeks.    The division is waging a heated debate with the Banking  Bureau over reform of the financial system. In particular, it  argued for the interests of the securities industry in  connection with participation by city banks in the securities  business and strongly proposed gradual participation. However,  simultaneous entry by the top city banks was decided, and the  division was forced to compromise broadly with the Banking  Bureau.    The position of the Securities Companies Division director  is  a key post within the MOF. It is considered to be second only to  the Coordination Division director within the Securities Bureau.  Current Director Matsutani has served for many years in the  budget field and has proved his capability.    The Investment Control Office was established within the  Securities Companies Division in 1987 to specialize in  supervising rapidly growing investment trusts and investment  advisers.    The Investment Trust Research Society was started in  November  1993, with the Investment Control Office serving as its  secretariat. It seeks out problems in Japan's investment trust  system which has remained virtually unchanged since 1951 and  considers measures for its improvement. Its goal is to compile a  report by June, and Director Sumiharu Kusu (MOF class of 1975)  and his staff are busy in preparation.  <H5>  [24 Mar 94 p 2] </H5>   [Text] Securities and Exchange Surveillance  Commission--Gradual Buildup of Achievements and Staff    Apart from the MOF which has devoted itself to protecting  and  nurturing the securities industry, there is the "watchdog of the  securities market" which oversees securities companies and the  markets. Instituted in July 1992, the commission has gradually  achieved results within a year and eight months or so including  the criminal indictment case of the Japan Unisys stock  manipulation and the recommendation of punishment in nine cases  by securities companies.    The chairman is Toshihiro Mizuhara, former superintendent of  the Nagoya High Public Prosecutor's Office with commissioners  Masaji Narita and Hidetaka Mihara serving under him. The  secretariat consists of Director Shigemitsu Sugizaki (MOF class  of 1964) and 84 members. It is a mixed group that hails from the  National Tax Administration Agency, the Japan Fair Trade  Commission, the Board of Audit, the Public Prosecutor's Office,  the courts, and the National Police Agency. The members total  about 200 with inspectors of securities and exchange from the  Regional Financial Bureaus included.    Under the secretariat are two divisions: the Coordination  and  Inspection Division and the Special Investigation Division. The  Coordination and Inspection Division headed by Director Sei  Nakai (MOF class of 1968) is divided into the inspection sector  which inspects securities companies, the exchange sector in  charge of watching the market and the coordination sector which  handles office affairs.    The Special Inspection Division consisting of Director Hisao  Tateishi (MOF class of 1971) and 25 staff members are in charge  of inspecting illegal activities such as stock manipulation on  the basis of the Securities and Exchange Law. It does not have  authority for summary arrest but is authorized to conduct  compulsory inspection as necessary including search and  confiscation.    In the past, in addition to conducting compulsory inspection  and indictment in connection with the Japan Unisys stock  manipulation case, it has conducted compulsory inspection of the  bankrupt educational publishing company "Aipech" [as  transliterated] late last year on suspicion of window- dressing  settlement.    Compared to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  [SEC]  with its powerful authority, Japan's personnel is a mere  one-thirteenth, and there are calls for a stronger organization.    In addition to approving an increase of two staffers in the  FY94 budget, efforts are made to improve the organization by  sending its members to the U.S. SEC for training.  <H5>  [25 Mar 94 p 2] </H5>   [Text] MOF Financial Bureau/First and Second Capital  Divisions--Sole Control of Financial Investment Capital    Financial investment and loans constitute what is called the  "second budget." The First Capital Division and the Second  Capital Division are in sole control, ranging from the  "entrance" of capital such as postal savings to the "exit" where  loans are made to public corporations such as the Japan  Development Bank and the National Finance Corporation. Staffers  say: "There are two divisions, but we are one capital family."    The First Division is the staff headquarters so to speak. It  is in charge of not only planning and drafting financial  investment programs for each fiscal year but also watches the  trends in postal savings and pension problems at the "entrance"  and government-related financial institutions at the "exit."    On the other hand, excluding the Japan Development Bank and  the Export-Import Bank of Japan which are handled by the First  Division, the Second Division is a frontline corps that  supervises 50-odd lenders individually.    Attention on financial investment has recently mounted  sharply. Amid the severe financial circumstances in the general  account, many housing measures and small-and-medium business  measures have utilized financial investment in the continuing  business stimulating decisions during the past two years. The  function of financial investment called business adjustment is  operating fully during the prolonged recession.    On the other hand, there are also dilemmas. The funds of the  Fund Operation Department which supplies original capital for  financial investment are entrusted to it by the people, and  surety of redemption is demanded of their use.    At the end of 1993, the coalition ruling parties proposed a  concept of establishing a loan-purchase organization which uses  financial investment funds to promote processing of bad debts by  financial institutions. However, Director Fumio Inui (MOF class  of 1970) of the First Division pointed out the principle of  financial investment, and asked: "What would you do if the funds  become frozen?" The proposal was deferred.    Pressures for "reliance on financial investment" continue to  grow, but since difficulty in advancing funds is beginning to  surface, a debate on the direction of financial investment is  likely to flare up.    First Division Director Inui, "boss" of the "single capital  family" who works in a large room without compartments, served  for many years in the Budget Bureau and also in the Taxation and  Financial Bureaus. He is therefore well-versed in finance.  Second Division Director Yuzo Harada (MOF class of 1972) who  oversees individual lenders has served chiefly in the field of  international finance. The two are working in tandem on  financial investment which faces a crossroads.  <H5>  [29 Mar 94 p 2] </H5>   [Text] MOF Financial Bureau/Government Debt  Division--"Keystone" of National Bond Management Policy    Widening apprehension that the rise of long-term interest  rates is deterring a business recovery. Early this year, the  circulation yield on national bond index issues temporarily rose  to the 4-percent level, exceeding the usual early-year rises by  1 percent. Providing the backdrop for the rise in interest rates  is the fear of deteriorating supply-demand in the bond market  due to increasing issues of national bonds. Given the volatile  business trend, attention is drawn to the trend in the  Government Debt Division as the keystone of national bond  management policy.    With a decline in tax revenues and the continuing  implementation of economic measures, the national bond issue  balance is expected to exceed 200 trillion yen at the end of  FY94. Director Shokichi Takagi (MOF class of 1971) emphasizes  following a natural course, saying: "We will merely digest them  with stability by adapting a planned volume to market  conditions." Regarding interest rates, he points out the  difficulty of reading the financial market, saying: "A variety  of economic factors reflect on them."    Within the Government Debt Division is a separate room with  a  transparent wall. The director and his staff meet there with  representatives from banks and securities companies or talk with  them over the phone to exchange views on schedules for national  bond bidding and market conditions. When it is time to bid or  submit tenders, reporters from the news agencies are seen going  in and out of the division and reporting the prices. Given the  close daily relations with the financial market, the busy  activities of the division are conspicuous within the Financial  Bureau.    In addition, the division handles accounting of national  obligations including the special account and watches for  counterfeit national bonds.    Takagi served successively as assistant division director in  the National Property Coordination Division, the First Capital  Division, and the Second Capital Division and is well-versed in  the affairs of the Financial Bureau. When he was director of the  Securities Market Division, he solved the problem of  liberalizing fees for stock sales and purchases, and therefore,  he is knowledgeable in securities affairs. Masanori Totsuka,  government debt auditor (class of 1962), is in charge of the  government debt consolidation fund special account which  controls the redemption sources for national bonds.  <H5>  [31 Mar 94 p 2] </H5>   [Text] MOF International Finance Bureau/Coordination  Division--No Time To Relax With Numerous Unexpected Cases    The Foreign Exchange Bureau of the MOF was changed to the  International Finance Bureau in 1964 when Japan completed its  transition as a nation under Article 8 of the IMF and became a  member of the OECD. Subsequently, with the internationalization  of finance, the bureau's importance rose rapidly. Its personnel  of 136 surpassed the Banking Bureau (128) and the Securities  Bureau (84). The Coordination Division manages and supports the  large personnel.    The duties of the International Finance Bureau are widely  diversified. They range from stabilization of foreign exchange  to overseeing the international finance and capital market,  compilation of international balance statistics, coping with  cumulative debt problems, and economic aid to the developing  nations.    It is the difficult task of the Coordination Division as the  general coordinating sector to implement these parallel duties  simultaneously. It often faces with unexpected cases that are  impacted by changes in the international situation such as the  suspicion of nuclear development in the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea [North Korea], and there is no time to relax  throughout the year. Another source of headaches is the  inability to rest on weekends when international conferences  converge.    The post of director of the Coordination Division increases  in importance as the "ranking" of the MOF's International  Finance Bureau rises. In many cases, a future candidate for the  bureau director--often a candidate for finance secretary which  is treated as a deputy minister-class post--is assigned. Current  Division Director Norimichi Kawai (MOF class of 1969) served  successively as director of the International Organizations  Division, director of the Foreign Exchange Fund Division and  director of the Development Policy Division, which are the  principal divisions within the International Finance Bureau, and  he is highly experienced.    The International Coordination Office was established within  the Coordination Division in July 1993 as a sector specializing  in bilateral negotiations on finance. At present virtually all  of its duties are concentrated on negotiations with the United  States including the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. The  discussions have been suspended after the Japan-U.S. summit  talks ruptured in February [1994]. Since September 1993, Daisuke  Kotegawa (class of 1975), office director, and his staff who  continued coordination efforts for days and nights are presently  "recharging their batteries."  <H5>  [1 Apr 94 p 2] </H5>   [Text] MOF International Banking  Division--Coordinator Between Japanese Banks and Foreign  Governments    The posture of Japanese banks vis-a-vis international  banking  has changed considerably during the past decade. It is  particularly true concerning exchange with the developing  nations. Since the mid-1980's, banks have devoted themselves to  debt recovery due to the rise of cumulative debt problems.  However, with marked economic growth in Asia from the early  1990's, they have shown a stance of aggressive advancement into  the region. Recently, they have been focusing on Central and  South America which are the "central sources" of debt problems.  The International Banking Division serves as the coordinator  between the Japanese banks which are eager to advance overseas  and the foreign governments.    The Foreign Exchange Law stipulates general capital  exchanges  with foreign countries as the supervisory scope of the division.  Consequently, the division is visited by the officers in charge  not only from banks but also from securities companies and  general trading companies. Its recent duties, however, consist  predominantly of works related to the advance into Asia by  Japanese banks.    The Asian strategy among Japanese banks focuses not only on  Hong Kong and Singapore where branches have been previously  established, but it also focuses on full-fledged advancement  into Thailand, Malaysia, and China. Some city banks want to "be  allowed to establish branches ahead of their competitors and to  use that advantage toward concrete results" (a bank executive).    Director Yukio Yoshimura (MOF class of 1970) who served in  the embassies abroad for many years is a leading  internationalist within the bureau. In his previous post as  director of the International Organizations Division, he  traveled to numerous countries to attend such international  conferences as the IMF and the G-7 finance ministers and central  bank governors conference. Even such internationalist as  Director Yoshimura, his views on the somewhat overheated  eagerness of the banks to advance into Asia are calm and points  out "a need to pay more consideration to local circumstances."    In the International Banking Division, the study of  derivatives such as swaps and options has surfaced as a new  task. The reason is that a sharp rise is seen in international  derivatives trading. The offices that were formerly handled  inspection of loans by Japanese banks to the developing nations  have recently been engaged in the study of derivatives products.  <H5>  [5 Apr 94 p 2] </H5>   [Text] MOF International Finance  Bureau/International Organizations Division--The Hub of the IMF  and International Conferences    A clock showing the times in Washington and Paris hangs on  the wall in the large room. On the desks are piles of documents  written in English. English is constantly heard throughout the  division and fax messages are exchanged with various stations.  While serving as Japan's window at the IMF, the division is the  secretariat for the MOF at international conferences such as the  G-7 finance ministers and central bank governors conference held  in February and the APEC [Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation]  conference in March [1994]. The division personnel totals 13,  but "they accompany the minister and finance secretaries, and  someone is always on a trip overseas" (Director Shigeo Kashiwagi  (MOF class of 1973). The sector is directly linked to the  "international stage."    The division was originally established with jurisdication  over the international monetary system with its central role as  a window to the IMF and the OECD. Following the transition to a  floating rate system in 1973, the importance of policy  cooperation among the advanced nations in economic operations  rose and its role as a conference secretariat expanded  correspondingly.    Amid rising expectations and hopes in Japan toward recovery  of the global economy, the staff members are busy preparing for  the G-7/IMF provisional committee meeting which is scheduled for  late April [1994]. It will be followed successively by the OECD  ministerial directors meeting in June and the Naples summit in  July. Unlike the schedule of busy preoccupation with the budget  from summer until the yearend with a respite in early spring,  the division will face its "real grind" from here on.    It occupies a pivotal position between the overseas offices  and Japan concerning the IMF. It conducts endless liaison with  the Japanese director's office in Washington on items on the  agenda of the directors meetings held three times weekly at IMF  headquarters. It transmits data overseas on how to present  Japan's position regarding problems of the global economy and a  variety of problems on relations between Japan and the advanced  and developing nations.    Director Kashiwagi who has been assigned to the IMF as an  economist stresses the need for personnel contribution  commensurate with an economic power when he says: "Of the  approximately 2,200 staffers at the IMF headquarters, there are  only about 10 Japanese excluding those on assignment from the  MOF. This number is far too few."  <H5>  [6 Apr 94 p 2] </H5>   [Text] MOF International Finance Bureau/Research  Division--Role To Prepare International Balance of Payments    The External Economic Reform Outline decided by  the government at the end of March [1994] clearly indicates the  government forecast that the FY94 current account surplus will  show a GDP [gross domestic product] of about 2.8 percent.  Furthermore, it presents its goal of "a significant reduction in  the mid-term current account surplus." Providing the backdrop  for the government's determination toward surplus reduction is  the reality that Japan's surplus in 1993 exceeded $130 billion,  reaching the highest level in history. The International Finance  Bureau's Research Division prepares statistical bulletins on the  international balance of payments every month and makes public  Japan's current account surplus which is the focus of attention  at home and abroad.    Every year, the Research Division prepares the international  balance portion of the government's economic forecast while  consulting with the Audit and Planning Division of the  Minister's Secretariat and the EPA [Economic Planning Agency],  parallel with the formulation of the budget draft. The current  account surplus in the FY94 forecast is expected to be about  13.8 trillion yen, or a drop of 600 billion yen from the  previous fiscal year.    The Research Division also serves as the secretariat for the  Foreign Exchange Council which is an advisory organ for the MOF  and MITI ministers. In June 1993 the council prepared a report  seeking stronger risk controls over such derivatives as swaps  and options in view of expanding exchange in the international  financial markets. This fiscal year, it is conducting research  on the theme of how international financial exchange is being  conducted in the public and private sectors.    Another important duty of the Research Division is to  ascertain principal economic indicators of the various nations  and to manage their data.    Comments made by Director Hiroshi Uchimura (class of 1974)  during the announcement of international balance of payments  attract the attention of market-related quarters as representing  the Japanese Government's view concerning the surplus problem.  Consequently, on the eve of the announcement, the division is  busy checking figures and drafting statements. Kazuko Tanaka  (class of 1966), an expert on international balance of payments,  is responsible for reexamining computation methods for the  balance of payments. It is conducted as a response to the IMF's  revision of the criteria for submission of international balance  of payment reports.  <H5>  [8 Apr 94 p 2] </H5>   [Text] MOF Foreign Exchange and Money Market Division  and International Capital Division--Determining Pros and Cons of  Market Intervention    The Foreign Exchange and Money Market Division is the MOF's  "dealing room" with rows of terminals that report the trends in  the foreign exchange market. Its role is to decide the direction  of market intervention while keeping an eye on trends in the  exchange market. Because of the development of the high yen  since last year, calls for moves by the division have increased.  It is the window to the Bank of Japan [BOJ]'s International  Bureau and is filled with tension particularly during the  business hours of the Tokyo market.    In tense situations, it watches the market from dawn to late  in the night and instructs the BOJ to intervene if necessary.  The Foreign Exchange and Money Market Division controls the  Foreign Exchange Capital Control Special Account which supplies  intervention funds. When the BOJ intervenes in yen sales and  dollar purchases, payments are made from this account. However,  Director Nobuhiko Kawakami (MOF class of 1971) says: "Alsolutely  no comment on intervention," and the realities are wrapped in  secrecy.    Nonetheless, there was a surplus payment of 3.83 trillion  yen  from the account in FY93. It was the second largest overpayment  after FY86 and indicates the second largest scale of  intervention since the Februry 87 Louvre Accord which took place  last fiscal year. Director Kawakami, who transferred to his  present post from director of the International Finance Bureau's  Development Finance Division in July 1992, sounds edgy  concerning his fight againt the high yen when he says: "The  continuing situation does not permit one to relax."    The International Capital Division is in charge of internal  and external capital exchange. Whenever companies issue foreign  bonds or when foreign governments and companies issue  yen-denominated bonds directed toward Japan's investors, a  notification to the MOF is required, and the division serves as  the window. Director Toru Nio (class of 1972) says: "Our task is  to maintain a balance between capital flow and deregulation in  tune with the international environment."    Regarding deregulation, in January 1994 the division set  forth a measure to ease the qualifying criteria for foreign  bonds issued by the companies and yen-denominated foreign bonds  issued by foreign companies. It has held discussions with  market-related groups on yen-denominated foreign bonds since  early this year and is studying measures to revitalize the  market including its marketability.  <H5>  [12 Apr 94 p 2] </H5>   [Text] MOF International Finance Bureau/Third  Development Division--Role in Reducing Surplus Through Capital  Reflux    Japan-U.S. relations are deteriorating over Japan's huge  current account surplus. Attention is focused on an overlay of  Japan's public works investment and an expansion of domestic  demand as breakthrough measures, but actually capital reflux  measures by Japan play a large role in reducing the surplus. The  MOF International Finance Bureau's "three development  divisions"--the Development Policy Division, the Development  Institutions Division, and the Development Finance Division--may  be regarded as the practical business corps, so to speak, of  such capital reflux measures.    The Development Policy Division which controls the  bilateral-based ODA [Offical Development Assistance] maintains  indispensable liaison and negotiations with MOFA [the Ministry  of Foreign Affairs], the EPA and MITI. The reason is that  "development assistance measures cannot be implemented by a  single ministry or agency." At summit conferences by the  advanced nations, the problem of aid to the developing nations  is invariably discussed, and the workload of the division rises  steadily prior to such conferences.    The Development Policy Division's important task consists of  putting the support framework and methods into concrete form. It  is also in charge of solving the debt problems of the cumulative  debtor nations thus braodening the scope of its jurisdictional  duties.    The ODA [Official Development Assistance] provides not only  bilateral support but also support through international  institutions. It is overseen by the Development Institutions  Division. The division personnel handles office procedures for  decisionmaking by international institutions and preparations  for annual general meetings. The division is divided into  sections by institutions, such as the International Bank for  Reconstruction and Development [IBRD], the Asian Development  Bank [ADB], and the United States Development Bank and provides  thorough "background support" to enable the respective  institutions to conduct smooth operations.    The International Finance Division, unlike the Policy  Division and Institutions Division, is in charge of work related  to individual financing problems, rather than to the policy  aspect. A classic example is the disposition of financing cases  by the Export-Import Bank of Japan. The majority of the bank's  financing is cooperative financing with Japan's private banks  and may be regarded as the most "businesslike" among the three  divisions in terms of practical business affairs. The division  is also in change of yen loans.</p>

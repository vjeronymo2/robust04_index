			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Job-search in Germany Slow off the mark they may have been, but it is hard to fault the efforts of chancellor Helmut Kohl and his Christian Democrat colleagues in their search for solutions to Germany's growing economic crisis. There is nothing like an election year to focus the minds of incumbent politicians. Yesterday the governing coalition agreed to another batch of public spending cuts and an 'Action Programme' to speed job creation. This 30-point plan, which includes a dose of privatisation and deregulation, looks like being the main element in the coalition's election platform. Ideally, the coalition would have gone to the polls with a recovery well under way. The best it can probably hope for, after the largest annual fall in output since the second world war, is that the economy will not continue to deteriorate in 1994. But unemployment in western Germany is now 2.5m - 8.1 per cent of the working population and still rising. Millions more east Germans are in either official or disguised unemployment. The risk of electoral disaster for the government and success for parties of the far right is real. Macroeconomic policy remains far from growth-inducing. The Bundesbank shows little sign of accelerating the snail-like pace of interest rate cuts, despite overwhelming evidence that monetary policy is too tight and that fiscal policy is also contractionary. The recent data suggest that economics minister Gunter Rexrodt's official forecast of 1 to 1.5 per cent growth this year is wishful thinking. The zero growth prediction of the government's independent economic advisers looks much nearer the mark. What the coalition can do is appear to be trying to affect the employment-intensity of growth. Hence the package of deregulatory measures designed to make it easier to hire part-time workers, to enable companies to hire the long-term unemployed by undercuting minimum wages, to legalise private employment agencies and to clamp down on companies which employ illegal immigrants. Modest dose In short, the German government has proposed a modest dose of Anglo-American-style 'flexibility'. The proposals, following the European Commission's recent employment white paper, have a decidedly Delorsian tinge which should make it harder for the Social Democratic Party to oppose them outright. Moreover, the mood of the German unions is also shifting. The recent wage deal in the chemicals industry involves a modest 2 per cent wage rise and accepted plant-level bargaining over the working week within a 35 to 40 hour range. Low wages The structure of Germany's labour market also suggests that the potential for more rapid job creation exists. The Anglo-American experience in the 1980s suggests that liberalising employment regulations encourages companies to hire more women, young people and immigrants to work part-time for relatively low wages in the service sector. Germany has fewer women in work than either the US or UK, a lower proportion of part-time jobs, a smaller service sector and a more compressed wage distribution. Yet US and British experience shows that relatively rapid growth of service sector employment can co-exist with stubborn male unemployment. While women are going out to work, relatively unskilled men are left waiting hopelessly for the return of their old industrial jobs. Germany avoided large-scale job-shedding in the 1980s, but industry is now reducing employment at a rapid rate. Since German manufacturing starts with a much higher share of total employment than other developed countries, male employment has correspondingly further to fall. How far depends, in part, on the stance of macroeconomic policy. The longer the Bundesbank uses a high exchange rate to bear down indirectly on service sector inflation, the greater the damage to industry. That service sector inflation has fallen by over 2 percentage points since the summer suggests a cut in short-term rates is now overdue. Even so, Germany will emerge from this recession with a much large number of long-term unemployed males, especially in the east. This year's election may be too soon for the far right to exploit their unease. But the threat will remain.</p>

			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / International Company News: Greek venture for Renison Goldfields Renison Goldfields, the Australian mining group in which Britain's Hanson group holds a large minority stake, has entered a joint venture agreement with Silver and Baryte Ores Mining, a Greek company, to explore for gold on the Greek island of Milos. Silver and Baryte, Europe's biggest bentonite producer and related to Bauxites Parnassus Mining Company, already mines for bentonite, perlite, kaolin and barytes on the island. Under the agreement, Renison will be able to earn a 75 per cent interest in the Midas project, of which Niugini Mining, which is controlled by Canada's Battle Mountain Gold, is entitled to 5 per cent.</p>

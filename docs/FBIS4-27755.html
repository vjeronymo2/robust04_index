			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by FRG Minister of Cooperation and Development </F> Carl-Dieter Spranger "in late May"; place not given -- recorded;  in German, with superimposed Vietnamese translation]    [Text] Our delegation's visit to Vietnam was made at the  invitation of Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet during his June 1992  visit to the FRG and by His Excellency Do Quoc San, head of the  State Planning Commission. We appreciate these invitations, as  they have made possible our visit to Vietnam. We have heartfelt  impressions of the hospitality and the impeccable welcome  extended to our delegation.    Our visit was to evaluate the current cooperative situation  while sounding out potential areas of cooperation. Now that  thousands of Vietnamese can speak German, this is a highly  valuable asset needed for our future cooperation. In the  relations of development cooperation, we expect that these  people will be provided with assistance and favorable conditions  so they can surge forward. It is our policy to assist the  efforts of developing countries rather than imposing any  prototypes, and we wish to see our cooperation coordinate with  the cultural and social conditions of each country.    The cooperation between our two countries has been  reestablished since 1990. The FRG has since reserved some 170  million German marks in aid for Vietnam. In addition, the FRG  has made remarkable contributions under the framework of  multilaterial cooperation to helping Vietnam. Here I would like  to refer to various programs sponsored by EC [European  Community], UNDP [United Nations Development Programs], the  Asian Development Bank, and the World Bank.    It can be said that the cooperation between our two  countires  has been focused on such areas as environmental protection and  natural resource protection, and especially the issue of  afforestation. Here I would like to refer to the questions of  providing assistance for economic and banking reforms and for  public admnistration, of encouraging the development of and  providing assistance for medium-and small-size enterprises,  creating conditions to obtain credit funds to help various  enterprises as well as to initiate some vocational training  programs.    We have helped with perfecting the power transmission  network  in the central region and with restoring some locomotives. We  have also provided assistance in the areas of agriculture and in  rural development.    It should also be pointed out the significance of the  reintegration program under which employment has been created  for those Vietnamese returning from Germany.    During this visit, we visited two enterprises run by  Vietnamese returning from Germany. Since the start of this  project in 1993, we have provided assistance to nearly 500  people. We have helped build initial bases and have therefore  created nearly 6,000 jobs.    We have all agreed that the development of our cooperative  relations is moving in the right direction. The Vietnamese side  has emphasized and highly appreciated the assistance given by  Germany in the area of economic reform. Here I would like to  further point out that we have exchanged views with the minister  of labor, war invalids, and social welfare over our increased  assistance in vocational training; and with the minister of  justice over our assistance for the building and expansion of  the legislative system. Thus, basically we are ready to further  increase our development cooperation. Meanwhile, we expect that  in the upcoming period, the two sides will jointly resolve their  bilateral issues still left open, that is the debt issue and the  signing of a reintegration agreement, etc...    The fine progress in Vietnam's economic and political  reforms  at present will have great significance not only for Vietnam but  also for the entire region.    The FRG Government is ready to support Vietnam in its  efforts  to develop its market-oriented and democracy-based economies and  a law-governing state.</p>

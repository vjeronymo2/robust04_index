The Publication in SHUKAN BUNSHUN Is  Based on a Hoax. There Will Be No Official Investigation in the  General Staff"]    [Text] The Japanese weekly SHUKAN BUNSHUN recently printed  excerpts from a top secret memorandum by the Center for Military  Strategic Analysis at the Russian General Staff, "The Russian  Federation Military Policy in the Asia-Pacific Region Under the  New Military Political Conditions." The document makes clear  that at the end of the 80's Russia was actively assisting the  DPRK in creating a nuclear missile capability, and as a result,  now Pyongyang has several nuclear warheads, as well as a  considerable number of medium-range missiles. The document is  dated 22 October 1993 and was to be presented first to General  Grachev and then to President Yeltsin. The Japanese weekly  obtained the memorandum from an anonymous officer at the General  Staff who also commented on it.    On 27 January IZVESTIYA printed an account of the SHUKAN  BUNSHUN publication written by its Tokyo correspondent Sergey  Agafonov, who added his comment that "there are no doubts about  the authenticity of the document" because it is printed on a  Defense Ministry form and has registration number 001 CM-137.    General Staff chief General Mikhail Kolesnikov told  SEGODNYA's correspondent that "there has never been a Center for  Military Strategic Analysis at the Russian General Staff." The  General Staff has a center for military strategic studies but  its functions do not include analysis of the military,  military-technical or military- industrial potential of foreign  countries. That is the jurisdiction of various structures in  the General Staff's Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU GSh).    The relevant Russian bodies are surely watching the  developments on the Korean Peninsula. General Kolesnikov said  that "according to information in our possession, today there  are no nuclear weapons in the DPRK. Nor are there any  medium-range missiles. The creation of nuclear missiles in the  DPRK any time soon is unlikely."    The memorandum published in SHUKAN BUNSHUN, which says  something quite different, was indeed printed on a Defense  Ministry form, but this kind of form is usually used to respond  to citizens' letters, not to report to the defense minister or  the president. The index showing that the document is "top  secret" (not "absolutely secret," as is stated in Agafonov's  article) has been placed other than where it should be. The  serial number CM-137 stamped on the memorandum (apparently the  main evidence of its authenticity) belongs not to the Defense  Ministry but to the former USSR Council of Ministers and  naturally has not been used in correspondence since 1991.    After an additional in-house inquiry the General Staff made  sure that such a document has not been worked out in any of its  structures and therefore it was not reported to General Grachev  or President Yeltsin. The General Staff chief is not going to  conduct any official investigation into the origin of this hoax.    General Kolesnikov expressed his surprise at the  unscrupulousness of SHUKAN BUNSHUN and IZVESTIYA. True, many  Moscow journalists (and not only journalists) know that  representatives of the Japanese press (unlike, for instance, the  Americans) willingly and generously pay for exclusive  information and have a special liking for various "documents."  Which is exploited by our "specialists."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 21 Jan (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Zhang  Siqing, procurator general of the Supreme People's  Procuratorate, recently revealed that in mainland China most of  the criminal offenders involved in corruption cases are those  who are in charge of affairs related to money, while most who  receive bribes are those who hold the power of disposing human,  financial, and material resources, in particular those who have  direct access to certain specific powers.    Zhang Siqing said criminal cases nowadays involve  increasingly large amounts of money, and the number of major and  extraordinarily serious cases are multiplying. From January to  September 1993, cases involving more than 10,000 yuan each that  procuratorial organs placed on file for investigations accounted  for 60 percent of all cases placed on file during that period;  and 77 cases of corruption and bribery involved over 500,000  yuan. Hence the numbers of these two categories of cases are  double and triple the figures for the same period of 1992  respectively.    In terms of sectors of origin, more cases took place in  monopolized sectors, such as the sectors of banking, railway  transport, capital construction, and land project examination  and approval. Hot-spot economic construction sectors, including  the negotiable securities, stock, and real estate markets, have  seen some new forms of criminal offense. The number of  collective crimes has increased, with a remarkable increase in  the number of cases involving collaboration between both those  from within and without an organization, between people from  different trades, and from different areas.    Cases of graft and bribery occur frequently in localities  and  departments seriously suffering from evil trends and, very  often, a single case taken up by a procuratorial organ may  expose a series of new cases. The nature of cases can be a  mixture of graft and bribery, smuggling, tax evasion, favoritism  and cheating, dereliction of duty, harboring of evildoers and  covering up of evil deeds, forgery of documents, and so on, and  it is pretty common that a single case involves several crimes  and many persons, or a single crime involves many offenders.</p>

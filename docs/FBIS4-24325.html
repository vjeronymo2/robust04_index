			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] In their attempt to escape justice for  involvement in massacres at the Lutheran Church and the United  Nations compound in Monrovia and the Harbel massacre in Marguibi  County, the Armed Forces of Liberia [AFL] and the Monrovia-based  politicians of the former IGNU [Interim Government of National  Unity] have embarked on a cover-up for AFL officials and certain  ministers of the dissolved Sawyer government. The officials  allegedly connected -- especially to the Harbel massacre --  include State Councilman Phillip Banks and former IGNU  Information Minister Lamine Waritay, for presenting false  evidence on the Harbel massacre. Former IGNU Foreign Minister  Bacchus Matthews will also face trial for attaching a cover  letter to the communications sent to the American State  Department and Amnesty International on the Harbel massacres.    Former President Amos Sawyer, as the then AFL commander in  chief, is to also have his share of the war crimes trial. As  for the United Nations compound and the Lutheran Church  massacres, Armed Forces of Liberia Chief of Staff Hezekiah  Bowen, Charles Julue, (Edward Slanger), (Moses Wright), and  several other key elements within the Monrovia AFL and security  network will be the ones to face trial. These massacres against  innocent Liberian civilians by the Armed Forces of Liberia and  the dissolved interim government of Amos Sawyer were reportedly  carried out outside actual combat, which warrants their trial.  Two former Nigerian ECOMOG commanders, Generals Joshua  Dogonyaro and Adetunji Olurin, also form part of the massacre  case in Liberia during the war crimes trial.    Meanwhile, the NPFL leader, Former President Taylor, has  spelled out how ECOMOG, an alien military force, has been  assisting the AFL and the Monrovia group in murdering Liberians  in large numbers.    [Begin Taylor recording] [Word indistinct] ECOMOG (?without)  ECOWAS [Economic Community of West African States] sent a  murderous government here, and they must bear the full  responsibility for the murder of our people. They must bear the  responsibility for the murder of our people. [repeats sentence]  We are not talking about recrimination. Acts, wrongful acts,  have been committed by all sides throughout the crisis. We are  not talking about witch-hunting, paying back, but we have known  for several years individuals that are walking the streets of  Monrovia that individual Liberians can identify as having slain  their mothers, their fathers, their brothers -- beheaded them.  Why should these people continue to walk? These are sick minds  and must be extracted from society. They must be. People can  identify who murdered Van Richards, people can identify who  beheaded [name indistinct], people can identify who shot at the  Lutheran Church. We are not talking about witch-hunting here.  We are talking about blatant, calculated, premeditated murder.  [end recording]    The NPFL leader said that various atrocities in Liberia were  carried out with the pre-disposition of blaming them on the  NPFL. He spoke of the need for action against those involved in  the wailful murders of Liberians.    [Begin Taylor recording] [passage omitted] All of those that  are responsible must present themselves to be arrested, and we  are calling upon the United Nations to set up a special court to  try these people.

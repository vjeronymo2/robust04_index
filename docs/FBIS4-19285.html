			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by President Suleyman Demirel, dated 14 April </F> 1994 -- read by announcer over still of Demirel]    [Text] Turkey is a constitutional state. The Constitution  determines the type of state and regime. The state is based on  rules and institutions. No one has the power to forcibly change  that. The state has the power and the solutions to protect  itself, the tranquillity of the people, the democratic regime,  and the indivisible unity of the country and nation. Everything  transpires on the basis of the law and of legitimacy. No one  should even dream of achieving anything by resorting to force or  by violating the law at the cost of blood and tears. Such  efforts fall outside the law and legitimacy and are incompatible  with humanity or a clear conscience. In such cases, the state  resorts to legitimate measures and solutions to prevent  violence, brute force, and bloodshed.    The state, with all its institutions, is fully aware of its  duties and ready to carry them out. The people follow  everything closely. Institutions, establishments, and persons  who owe their existence to the democratic system should not make  use of the freedom it gives them to threaten or undermine the  secular and democratic Turkish Republican State or democracy.    I ask my citizens to remain levelheaded in the face of  irresponsible acts and statements. Everyone must continue to  trust our state and the secular and democratic Turkish Republic.</p>

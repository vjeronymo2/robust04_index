			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Dogged lobbying by drinks industry pays off - Analysis Unchanged rates of duty on beer and spirits reflect the success of intense lobbying by the industries. The brewers - which last night delightedly welcomed their first Budget relief for five years - had mounted a powerful campaign to persuade the chancellor that any increase in beer duty, after the 1.5p a pint rise in March, would increase the damage already being done to the industry by cross-Channel shopping. The increase in personal imports of duty-paid beer from France is already estimated to account for about 12 per cent of the UK's take-home market; equivalent to about 700,000 barrels a year or the output of a large brewery. Loss of revenue to the Treasury this year is expected to amount to Pounds 130m on legitimate imports alone - but smuggling is also believed to be growing. The brewers warned that any increase in beer prices above those prevailing in Continental Europe would further stimulate cross-Channel trade. They claimed, too, that continual increases in duty, up by 31 per cent in real terms since 1979, had contributed to the 25 per cent decline in beer sales through pubs during the same period. Beer duties had already been increased twice this year - by 5 per cent in the March Budget and by a further 2.7 per cent from a change in the duty collection system in June which the government had promised would be fiscally neutral. The chancellor acknowledged the strength of these arguments yesterday. The chancellor's St Andrew's Day decision to continue the standstill on spirits duty introduced in March was welcomed by the Scotch Whisky Association. The 2p increase on a bottle of wine, however, was dubbed as 'irresponsible' by the Wine and Spirits Association. It would lead to increased cross-Channel shopping to the detriment of UK retailers, it said. Cross-channel imports also weighed less heavily than health factors in the chancellor's treatment of cigarettes. The Tobacco Advisory Council described the 11p per packet increase, on top of a 10p increase in March, as 'outrageous.' It added: 'The country's 17m smokers, who already pay Pounds 23m a day in tobacco taxes, are being used to make up the Treasury's shortfall.' ASH, the anti-smoking organisation, welcomed the decision as 'very helpful to health'. It could reduce demand for cigarettes by 2bn a year and eventually save 2,500 lives a year.</p>

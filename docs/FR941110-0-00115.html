			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed more fully below, residents do have opportunities for giving information to the surveyors during the survey process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter believed that providing pre-hearings for monetary penalties, without providing any hearing, formal or informal, prior to imposition of harsher sanctions is irrational.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pre-sanction hearings are available when monetary penalties are assessed because the provisions of section 1128A of the Act apply. These procedures require pre-sanction hearings when civil monetary penalties are assessed. As discussed above, the statute clearly provides for the immediate imposition of remedies where civil money penalties are not involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter argued in favor of a written appeals process prior to revocation of the facility's license.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Termination of a provider agreement is not termination of a license to do business; therefore, we do not accept the implication that pre-termination hearings should be available on the grounds that a license is being revoked, especially when the statute, legislative history and case law so clearly point in the other direction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A few commenters stated their belief that HCFA is inappropriately extending its rulemaking authority to supersede State laws which provide pre-sanction hearings. Some commenters noted that current Medicaid regulations at &sect;431.153(b) allow States the option of providing pre-hearings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A few commenters stated that there was no statutory basis for HCFA's proposal to eliminate pre-sanction hearings in the Medicaid program, and no indication that the Congress intended to eliminate this State practice. These commenters noted that there is a material difference between the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the impact of not having a pre-hearing available because nursing homes usually have many more Medicaid residents than Medicare residents. They stated that loss of Medicaid reimbursement has a greater financial impact than the loss of Medicare reimbursement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A few people commented that the statutory requirement to minimize the length of time between identification of deficiencies and imposition of remedies is not a mandate to eliminate the time between the two events.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A few people commented that the proposed regulation was making terminations so easy to accomplish, by providing only for post-termination hearings, that the Congressional intent to provide alternatives to termination was being undermined.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MONTCLAIR PREP NOT READY TO TURN OVER LEAGUE LEAD  </P> <P> The Montclair Prep baseball team sent an early message to Village Christian  High, its Alpha League rival and the team that was supposed to replace the  Mounties at the top of the league heap.  </P> <P> Mounties' shortstop Keyaan Cook barreled into Village Christian catcher Greg  Lloyd to end the top of the first inning Friday night, leaving Lloyd obviously  shaken and causing Cook to be ejected from the game.  </P> <P> But Cook's hit -- combined with 10 of the more traditional kind, a pair of  five-run innings and a 13-3 victory at Bluebird Field in Sun Valley --  definitely served notice that Montclair Prep was not about to step aside  quietly.  </P> <P> "We wanted to take a message to them that we're still the team to beat in this  league," Montclair Prep Coach Walt Steele said.  </P> <P> Message received.  </P> <P> Montclair Prep (10-5-1 overall, 5-0 in league play) scored five runs in the  third inning to break a 1-1 tie. J. T. Billingslea hit a home run just inside  the foul pole in left field to break the tie, and Andy Shaw and Brent Polacheck  each added two-run singles in the inning.  </P> <P> The Mounties scored single runs in the fourth and fifth innings before rallying  for five more runs off reliever Drew Martenson in the sixth. Russell Ortiz and  Polacheck each had two-run singles in that inning.  </P> <P> "We've seen everyone else and this is the team we wanted to take it to,"  Montclair Prep pitcher Chris Andersen said.  </P> <P> Andersen (7-0) kept Village Christian (13-5, 4-1) off balance all night. The  6-foot-3, 240-pound senior allowed one hit -- a solo home run by Matt Smay --  while striking out 11 in six innings.  </P> <P> He tired in the seventh, however, allowing a pair of runs on two walks and two  singles.  </P></p>

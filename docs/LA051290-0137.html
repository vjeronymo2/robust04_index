			<p><P> May 12, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DRUG STING IN ANAHEIM NETS JUDGE;  </P> <P> INVESTIGATION: POLICE WERE TIPPED OFF EARLIER THIS YEAR THAT THE MUNICIPAL  COURT COMMISSIONER WAS USING COCAINE ON A 'REGULAR BASIS.'  </P> <P> Capping a six-month investigation, Anaheim police said Friday that they caught  an Orange County traffic judge in a sting operation and arrested him on  suspicion of cocaine possession.  </P> <P> Police said they received a tip earlier this year that Municipal Court  Commissioner Robert K. Tuller Jr., 46, based in the Fullerton courthouse, used  cocaine on a "regular basis."  </P> <P> That information prompted an investigation by members of the Anaheim police  force, the district attorney's office and state Bureau of Narcotics  Enforcement.  </P> <P> Tuller was invited by undercover agents to a "party" at the Anaheim Sheraton  hotel Friday, police said. When Tuller allegedly bought an unspecified quantity  of cocaine from an undercover agent with the state Bureau of Narcotics  Enforcement, the arrest was made, according to a statement put out by Anaheim  Police Chief Joseph T. Molloy.  </P> <P> After being booked, Tuller posted bail of $5,000 and was released on his own  recognizance at 4 p.m. by Municipal Judge Margaret Anderson, the presiding  judge in the Fullerton courthouse.  </P> <P> Tuller, leaving his home Friday night with a man he identified as his attorney,  said when asked about the charges: "I don't know anything about it. That's it."  </P> <P> A lifetime Fullerton resident, Tuller was a deputy marshal in the North County  Municipal Court in Fullerton, then practiced law in private practice for 13  years. He was appointed to the bench as a court commissioner by North Court  municipal judges in 1986.  </P> <P> He took the bench as a commissioner on July 7 of that year. With the exception  of some restrictions in serious felony cases, a court commissioner essentially  carries out the same day-to-day duties as judges.  </P> <P> Times correspondent Tom McQueeney contributed to this report.  </P></p>

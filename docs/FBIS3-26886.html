During a meeting with Patten in Sydney late this afternoon,  Keating emphasized the importance of the economic ties between  Australia and Hong Kong, government sources told XINHUA in a  phone interview this evening.    The talks, lasting for more than one hour, were described by  sources as friendly.    While details about the talks were not provided, sources  said  that the two leaders also discussed Hong Kong's role in the Asia  Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and regional development  issues including security.    Hong Kong is among Australia's top 10 trading partners and  has a total Australian investment of over 1.775 billion U.S.  dollars.    Patten, currently on a 7-day visit here, claimed before the  meeting that he hopes the visit will reinforce the economic and  trade links between the two sides.</p>

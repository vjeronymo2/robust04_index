Russia, which disapproves of NATO airstrikes against Bosnian  Serb positions, as of Thursday morning had not officially  reacted to the alliance's ultimatum issued overnight. [passage  omitted]    SEGODNYA said Yeltsin discussed the matter over the  telephone  Wednesday evening with several western leaders without  identifying them. [passage omitted]    Several Russian diplomats contacted Thursday declined to  comment on NATO's decision saying it was "too delicate an  issue." [passage omitted]    Meanwhile the Russian army's daily newspaper KRASNAYA ZVEZDA  reported Thursday that any ultimatum must be addressed to  Bosnia's three warring factions -- Muslims, Serbs and Croats --  and not only the Serbs.    "Washington's demands that the Serbs pull back their  artillery from Sarajevo or face airstrikes are blatantly  one-sided," the daily said. "This approach will no doubt be  interpreted by the other party to the conflict as an unspoken  support."</p>

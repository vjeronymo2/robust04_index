			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / US cuts in aid threaten IDA funding THE ENTIRE SDR13bn (Pounds 12bn) replenishment of the International Development Association, the arm of the World Bank which provides low interest loans to the poorest developing countries, could be thrown into doubt by the US Congress's efforts to accommodate new help for Russia inside a shrinking aid budget. The US had pledged a total contribution of Dollars 3.75bn (Pounds 2.4bn) spread over three years, but this year will only allot Dollars 1bn, 20 per cent less than promised. Because IDA's money is provided under a burden-sharing agreement negotiated last year, any other country could now decide to reduce its promised commitment by 20 per cent, a tempting option at a time of budget crisis in many developed countries. The IDA decision and other elements of the US aid bill are expected to triple the US arrears to international development organisations to around Dollars 1bn. The US aid bill produced by Congressman David Obey, who chairs the House of Representatives subcommittee in charge of foreign aid spending, provides a total of Dollars 12.9bn, Dollars 1.4bn less than President Bill Clinton had asked for, and will now move to the Senate for further discussion. To fit new aid for Russia inside this envelope, Mr Obey has proposed a 2 per cent cut in every aid spending category except refugees and the Peace Corps, and much deeper cuts in some categories. But the administration insisted on no cuts in aid to Egypt and Israel, which together account for 40 per cent of the US aid budget even though Israel's per capita income ranks between Ireland and New Zealand, so African and other developing countries will be particularly squeezed within each category. But some aid organisers acknowledged that the blow could have been worse, noting that Mr Obey had done his best to preserve funding for refugees, disaster assistance and sustainable development. Funding for debt relief will be slashed. The US, which has been the only leading creditor not to grant full relief on loans to the poorest countries of sub-Saharan Africa, had originally allotted Dollars 45m to debt relief this year, but this will be scaled back to only Dollars 7m. President Bill Clinton promised Dollars 1.6bn to President Boris Yeltsin at their summit meeting in Vancouver in April, added another slice in the formal budget he proposed a week later, and then promised a further Dollars 1.8bn at a meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrial nations in Tokyo earlier this month.</p>

			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UMBERG, AN OFFICER AND ASSEMBLYMAN, DOUBLE-TIMES IT  </P> <P> From the get-go, Tom Umberg knew it was going to be a tough job to turn out an  incumbent Republican and win election to the 72nd Assembly District from  central Orange County.  </P> <P> But now that he's pulled off that political coup, the Garden Grove Democrat has  discovered that, thanks to a monumental scheduling conflict, making plans to  get to Sacramento next week just to be sworn in has been no cinch either.  </P> <P> As a rookie assemblyman, Umberg is supposed to be in the state Capitol at noon  Monday to take his oath of office and immediately plunge with his legislative  colleagues into a special session called by Gov. George Deukmejian to deal with  a mounting state budget crisis.  </P> <P> Yet as a major in the Army Reserve, Umberg is scheduled to be in  Charlottesville, Va., next week as part of his yearly commitment to the  military.  </P> <P> Umberg said he's managed to persuade the reserves to let him start his two-week  tour on Tuesday so he can fly up to Sacramento for the swearing-in, cast a few  votes and attend a reception in honor of his election before taking off for the  East Coast. His original orders had him reporting for duty at 7:30 a.m. Monday  -- an assignment that would have precluded him from showing up in Sacramento.  </P> <P> But the Umberg household got another scheduling jolt Thursday, this one more  severe: Tom's wife, Robin, got a call from her 6252nd Army Reserve unit placing  her on alert status to await call-up for up to six months of active duty.  </P> <P> "I was rather expecting this. At least it's official now," said Robin Umberg, a  major in the reserves and an intensive care unit nurse, who is among 150  medical personnel based in Santa Ana being called to active duty, destination  unknown.  </P> <P> "I don't question being in the reserves. I'm ready for this professionally. But  it's as a mother that I have a lot of work to do. It's a very emotional  situation," she said. The Umbergs plan to have their children stay with  relatives and then a nanny while Umberg is in Sacramento and his wife is on  active military duty.  </P> <P> For Umberg, his new 7:30 a.m. Tuesday military start time still means he will  be away for much of the debate and votes having to do with Deukmejian's  proposal to chop $1 billion out of the state budget immediately.  </P> <P> Umberg said he's hoping the Legislature will simply put off the business until  Governor-elect Pete Wilson is sworn in next month. That way, he can serve out  his two weeks of military duty and return to Sacramento before lawmakers really  hunker down to business.  </P> <P> If not, he said, he's prepared to jump on a plane at a moment's notice. "If it  turns out there's going to be some important vote, and my vote is necessary and  there are going to be things that affect my constituents, then I will come  back," Umberg said Thursday.  </P> <P> "Nothing's come easy," Umberg said. "We had a tough primary. We had a tough  election. This is par for the course."  </P></p>

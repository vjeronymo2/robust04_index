			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL CONSIDERS PROPOSALS TO CURB PROBLEM OF DEBRIS CLUTTERING STREETS;  </P> <P> LITTER: THE CITY HASN'T CHANGED ITS SWEEPING ROUTE FOR 15 YEARS, BUT PARKING  RESTRICTIONS MAY BE A SIGN OF THE TIMES.  </P> <P> It is the white plastic foam cups that Lois Comeau hates the most. She can spot  them in the gutters of her Atwater Village neighborhood from 50 feet away.  </P> <P> Every other day after work, Comeau drags a garbage bag down Atwater Avenue to  the corner of Fletcher Drive and fetches the cups, discarded candy wrappers and  other litter wedged in the leaves and dried grass. On a typical day, she fills  an entire bag.  </P> <P> "It just drives me crazy," the adult-school teacher said. "I remember when Los  Angeles was a clean city. I just feel so sad that it is not that way anymore."  </P> <P> Comeau lives on one of the hundreds of streets in the city of Los Angeles that  are not posted for regular street sweeping, which means that her neighborhood  is swept about once a month rather than once a week. And because there are no  signs restricting parking on sweeping days, the cleaning often does little good  because the gutters -- where 97% of debris piles up -- are blocked by  automobiles.  </P> <P> It has been almost 15 years since the Los Angeles City Council added streets to  the city's posted sweeping schedule, but complaints from residents such as  Comeau may change that. Several proposals to add thousands of miles of posted  residential routes are being mulled over by two council committees, and the  full council is expected to take them up early next year.  </P> <P> "I hear about it every time I meet with block clubs or neighborhood groups,"  Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores said. "People want their streets cleaned."  </P> <P> But the proposals carry hefty price tags and involve sensitive political  decisions that the council may be reluctant to make. Should the city provide  the same level of street sweeping to all neighborhoods? What areas are the  neediest? Who should pay for the expanded sweeping routes?  </P> <P> One proposal would add a one-time $36 charge to the water and power bills of  residents who live on streets that would get new postings. In some parts of the  city, residents have already offered to buy "No Parking" signs for their  streets to get better service. Some council members say they find such  alternatives offensive, but others say they may be the way of the future.  </P> <P> Currently, all 13,085 curb miles of paved residential streets in the city get  swept, but some neighborhoods get more frequent service than others. (Curb  miles are a measure of the curbs on both sides of a street, meaning a  one-mile-long street has two curb miles).  </P> <P> About 1,926 curb miles are swept at least once a week at night, because they  are major or secondary highways in commercial and industrial areas, with which  the city deals separately from predominantly residential neighborhoods. An  additional 3,419 curb miles are posted with "No Parking" signs and are swept  weekly during the day.  </P> <P> The remaining 7,740 curb miles -- more than half the residential streets in the  city -- have no posted parking restrictions and are swept on an irregular  basis, averaging once every 4 1/2 weeks.  </P> <P> "What people want more than anything else is a safe city and a clean city,"  said Councilman Joel Wachs, one of several council members interested in  converting some or all of the 7,740 curb miles to more regular sweeping  schedules. "The two go hand in hand. There is a relationship between how a city  looks and what kind of activities go on there -- how safe it is."  </P> <P> Postal worker Patric Quinn said residents in his Canoga Park neighborhood rank  the need for cleaner streets just behind efforts to eliminate graffiti and  gang-related crime.  </P> <P> "If a neighborhood looks like a dump, that is the way people are going to feel  about it," said Quinn, who recently organized neighbors in the Owensmouth area.  "And if they feel that way, they aren't going to care about anything."  </P> <P> The council stopped adding posted routes in 1975 because the "No Parking"  signs, equipment and personnel were too expensive. The expanded sweeping  proposal preferred by the city's Bureau of Street Maintenance would cost more  than $80 million over five years. The city spends about $13 million a year on  street cleaning.  </P> <P> Officials say the city is relatively healthy in financial terms, but new  programs still mean trade-offs. Each dollar spent on sweeping streets, for  example, is a dollar less for police officers or sewer mains. For $80 million,  the city could pay the salaries of 350 new police officers for five years,  according to the Police Department.  </P> <P> And problems, some very costly, continue to come up. In a recent report, City  Administrative Officer Keith Comrie warned council members that state gas tax  revenues -- which are frequently used for street programs, such as paving and  sweeping -- will be needed for seismic reinforcement of bridges and roadways  identified since the Bay Area earthquake in October.  </P> <P> "It is important to assess the priority of posting additional street sweeping  routes with other city programs and financial commitments," Comrie wrote.  </P> <P> Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who chairs the council's Budget and Finance  Committee, has put off decisions about the proposals until January because of  the large sums of money involved. Yaroslavsky said he wants to consider them  during the council's mid-year budget review, when the council decides about new  funding requests from throughout the city.  </P> <P> "I am not opposed to more sweeping, but we are talking about a lot of money,"  Yaroslavsky said. "It is critical that we see it in the broader context of the  city's budget. If the economy has really cooled off this year, and our revenue  projections are too optimistic, then all of this may be pie in the sky."  </P> <P> Street maintenance officials say it is an ideal time to consider expanding the  city's sweeping program. The Bureau of Street Maintenance has put behind it a  series of problems in 1986 and 1987 involving mechanically flawed equipment and  a backlog of unswept streets in residential neighborhoods. And, according to  Assistant Director David A. Reed, the bureau has caught up with some other  pressing priorities, such as street paving.  </P> <P> "We think it is a damn good time to concentrate on some of the quality-of-life  aspects of this city," Reed said.  </P> <P> Although Reed said the bureau has not pushed for any particular proposal,  officials have made it clear that they prefer one calling for weekly restricted  parking routes on all 7,740 curb miles still not posted. Under the proposal,  about 1,550 curb miles would be added each year for five years, at an eventual  cost of $80 million -- the most expensive option.  </P> <P> Other proposals being considered by the council range from adding 775 to 3,600  curb miles of weekly posted sweeping routes. Several of the proposals also  suggest creating a new category, monthly posted routes, which would keep  streets on a four-week schedule but would impose new parking restrictions on  sweeping days. The cheapest proposal would cost about $5 million.  </P> <P> "Our greatest concern is, that, if the council decides to begin posting again,  that it make some kind of commitment to continue the program," Reed said. "If  you start the program up again, you are going to raise people's expectations.  Then all of a sudden if it stops again . . . that would make a lot of people  very angry."  </P> <P> Early discussions among council members have already touched upon one of the  most sensitive issues in city government: the equity of city services across  community borders and council districts. Flores, whose district extends from  Watts to Wilmington, has suggested that street-sweeping schedules be made more  uniform citywide.  </P> <P> One proposal by Flores would add 775 curb miles of weekly posted street  sweeping, as well as 6,965 curb miles of monthly routes. The weekly postings  would involve erecting about 50,000 "No Parking" signs on residential streets  identified by the Bureau of Street Maintenance and the City Council as the  dirtiest in the city.  </P> <P> Flores likes the proposal because it attempts to balance the number of weekly  posted curb miles among the council's 15 districts by assigning more new miles  to those districts that have fewer posted curb miles. As an example,  Yaroslavsky's district, which has three times more posted curb miles than  Flores' district, would get 14 additional curb miles compared to Flores' 109.  </P> <P> "I want everyone in this city to be equal," Flores said. "What is happening now  is, people in some parts of the city are getting different kinds and different  levels of city services than people in other areas. That is wrong."  </P> <P> Yaroslavsky, on the other hand, said the city cannot afford to provide the same  level of service throughout. He said the council must select the neediest  areas.  </P> <P> "We have to be discriminating with our budget dollar," he said. "Not every  neighborhood gets the same amount of police protection. Not every neighborhood  is going to get the same amount of street cleaning. It is just the way it is."  </P> <P> The city began establishing posted street sweeping routes in the early 1960s.  Officials intended to eventually post all residential streets. But when money  ran out in 1975, there were still large areas without signs. To qualify for  signs, more than 25% of the curbside parking spaces on a particular block had  to be occupied at sweeping time -- a formula the Bureau of Street Maintenance  intends to continue using, if new routes are approved by the council.  </P> <P> Generally, the city assigned highest priorities to streets in the central city,  gradually adding streets in outlying communities as years passed. But politics  and timing also played a role.  </P> <P> Street maintenance officials typically responded to requests from council  members, who were sometimes more concerned about pleasing voters than tending  to the city's dirtiest streets. As a result, some areas of the city developed a  patchwork of postings. In Atwater Village, for example, streets north of  Glendale Boulevard are posted for weekly sweeping, but those south of the  boulevard are not.  </P> <P> Recent complaints about poor street sweeping in some areas of the city are due  in part to the changing landscape of Los Angeles, city officials said. Some  streets that did not qualify for restricted parking routes 15 years ago are now  crowded with parked cars from new apartment buildings and condominiums.  Sweepers that once were able to hug the curb without posted parking  restrictions are now confined to the center of the street because of heavy  curbside parking.  </P> <P> "We have not found a street sweeper yet that will go under a motor vehicle,"  said Reed of the Bureau of Street Maintenance. "If we can't get to the gutters  and curbs, we can't guarantee anybody a clean street. There are many areas of  the city that are not going to be as clean as the residents would like them,  unless there is an expansion of restricted parking."  </P> <P> Frustration about inadequate sweeping has run so high in some Harbor Gateway  neighborhoods, the narrow city strip connecting Watts to the Los Angeles  Harbor, that residents have offered to pay for their own "No Parking" signs.  Tom and Betty Anderson, who live on 149th Street near Rosecrans Park, have  collected more than 200 signatures of residents willing to chip in for the  signs.  </P> <P> "All the trash and junk blows down our street from the park," Tom Anderson  said. "It really needs to be swept more than once a month. And with some 'No  Parking' signs, we would be able to call in the parking enforcement people and  get some of the parked cars ticketed. Right now the guy cruises down the middle  of the street. It is a waste."  </P> <P> The Department of Transportation, which oversees the placement of "No Parking"  signs and their enforcement, estimated in a recent report that it would cost  $2.1 million to manufacture, post and maintain for five years the 50,000 signs  needed to add 775 curb miles of weekly sweeping. The report said it would cost  each affected "business or dwelling unit" $36 for the signs.  </P> <P> Flores, who represents the Harbor Gateway, said she wouldn't stand in the way  of constituents wanting to pay for their own signs, but she described such  arrangements as unfair. She said everyone in the city should pay for the signs,  or no one should.  </P> <P> "Maybe we could cut that $36 price tag in half if everyone was paying it,"  Flores said.  </P> <P> Wachs said he would also consider charging for the service, but Councilwoman  Joy Picus, whose San Fernando Valley district would get 142 of the 775 proposed  curb miles, said a fee for the signs would simply anger residents who are  already fuming about their dirty streets.  </P> <P> "They would be just outraged by it," Picus said. "I would not support it."  </P> <P> Free or not, some residents don't want anything to do with the signs. A  neighborhood in San Pedro recently had its signs removed because residents were  tired of getting parking tickets on sweeping days. They gave up their weekly  sweeping with the signs. And in some affluent areas, residents say they would  rather have their gardeners clean the street than clutter the parkways with  unsightly "No Parking" signs.  </P> <P> "Frankly, signs are a form of litter themselves," one Hollywood Hills resident  said.  </P> <P> Regardless of what action the council takes, several officials said the effort  to clean the streets of Los Angeles will take more than stepped-up sweeping  schedules. Flores says she cleans the street outside her San Pedro home and  encourages complaining constituents to take a broom to their streets too.  </P> <P> Gail Watson, executive director of Los Angeles Beautiful Inc., said many  residents need to change bad habits.  </P> <P> "I am here in an area where they have street sweepers all the time," Watson  said from her downtown office. "But the area is still a mess. The only answer  is for the people who live and work around here to care about it. We need to  educate people to be concerned about dropping things in the street or out the  car window. Then we wouldn't need to spend all this money on cleaning the  streets."  </P> <P> </P> <P> PROPOSED RESTRICTED PARKING  </P> <P> One proposal before the City Council would add 775 curb miles of posted street  sweeping routes. Curb miles are a measure of the curbs on both sides of a  street, meaning a one-mile-long street has two curb miles.

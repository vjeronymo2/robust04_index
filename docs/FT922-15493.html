			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / UK Company News: Reduced operating costs help Nurdin &amp; Peacock to Pounds 27.6m IMPROVED COST controls helped Nurdin &amp; Peacock, the cash and carry wholesaler, lift pre-tax profits by 7 per cent to Pounds 27.6m for the year to December 29. The result was buoyed by interest receivable of Pounds 3.8m, compared with Pounds 4.6m last time. Mr David Poole, managing director, said the company had significantly cut operating costs. For example, wages - which represent about 50 per cent of the company's total costs - fell from 3.1 per cent of total sales to 2.7 per cent. Turnover advanced by 6.2 per cent to Pounds 1.37bn, although on a like-for-like basis volume actually declined by 4.5 per cent. The move to increase own-brand labels, such as Happy Shopper and Happy Chef, would continue, Mr Poole said. The current proportion of own label - at 22 per cent of turnover - was targeted to rise to 27 per cent. Net margins were marginally higher at 2.02 per cent. Mr Poole said it was unlikely that, in current trading conditions, margins could be increased this year. 'We believe we have got to be competitive and watch the general level of prices,' he said. However, the benefits of investment in laser scanning and a move towards central buying were expected to help margins next year. By 1993, said Mr Poole, all of the branches would be fully converted to laser scanning. During the year, the company opened three new branches in Chester, Blackpool and Sheffield, which accounted for Pounds 60m of the increase in turnover. The new branches are not expected to make a profit for three years. Capital expenditure was Pounds 3m higher at Pounds 35m. This year, the company plans to spend Pounds 45m opening a further three branches, for a total of 46, and extend the central distribution warehouse in Didcot. Earnings per share fell from 15.6p to 15p, having been inflated in 1990 by a deferred Pounds 1.9m tax credit. Excluding this, earnings per share rose by 1p to 15p. The final dividend is increased in line with profits to 3.6p for a total of 5.56p (5.2p). The shares closed down 8p at 156p.</p>

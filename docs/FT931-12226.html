			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Customs relief on single market IMPLEMENTATION of the single European market is moving smoothly for most UK businesses, with most difficulties occurring in other EC states, the Customs and Excise Department said yesterday, Andrew Jack writes. Mr Mike Rickwood, head of the department's single market unit, said: 'Most traffic is moving reasonably freely and a lot better than we had feared.' Companies and professional advisers were reporting that the transition had been largely effective, but officials admitted there that were still some problems with the new regime on the Continent, including long delays for excise goods at the Italian border.</p>

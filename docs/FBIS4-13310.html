"We have just completed a difficult agreement which took a  lot of time and (which gives) to the autonomy authority the  right to obtain the necessary frequencies for the Palestinian  police," Sha'th said.    "An accord was also reached on giving the Palestinians a  radio station and telephone network," he said without giving  details.    Each side had claimed the right to decide on their own  frequencies, with Israel wanting to avoid disrupting its  existing bands, an Israeli negotiator told AFP earlier.    The communications accord follows deals last week to set up  a  Palestinian police force and release 5,000 prisoners, but PLO  officials on Tuesday accused Israel of backtracking on the  prisoner issue.    One official who requested anonymity said Israel refused to  set a date for freeing 1,000 of the prisoners until it received  a PLO assurance that the Palestinian police "had the situation  well under control."    The official who asked not to be named said the 1,000 were  all serving long sentences for crimes judged serious by Israel.    PLO negotiator Muhammad Dahlan said Israel took a tougher  line on the prisoners after the Islamic Resistance Movement  Hamas carried out attacks that killed 12 Israelis this month.    Israel "now categorically rejected the release of certain  Hamas members," said Dahlan, who is in charge of the prisoner  file.    Under last week's accord 2,500 prisoners are to be released  when Israel and the PLO sign a final accord to launch self-rule  in the West Bank town of Jericho and the Gaza Strip.    An additional 2,500 prisoners would be set free three weeks  later when limited autonomous powers were transferred to the  Palestinians. More than 10,000 Palestinians are estimated to be  in Israeli jails.    A PLO negotiator said that Israeli proposals on jurisdiction  in the self-rule areas still fell short of Palestinian demands.  The two sides had also to settle the issue of water sharing  between Israelis and Palestinians.    In the Gaza Strip and West Bank, Israeli troops arrested  about 285 suspected Islamic fundamentalists in a major crackdown  following a series of revenge attacks for the Hebron massacre,  Palestinian sources said.    The vast majority were suspected of links with Hamas, which  has claimed the bombings of two buses in which 12 Israelis died,  and an axe attack on Monday in which five Israelis were hurt.    It was the biggest crackdown on fundamentalists since Israel  arrested hundreds in December 1992 following a wave of killings.  Israel deported 415 of the fundamentalist suspects to Lebanon  but allowed them to return last December.    The group has threatened to launch five attacks on Israeli  targets to avenge the massacre of 30 Moslems by a Jewish settler  in Hebron on February 25.</p>

			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Knives for the pure in heart: David Sexton risks opprobrium to seek out the best in blades for strictly peaceful uses SAYING YOU like knives invites opprobrium, especially since more young people are carrying them for criminal purposes. Outside my house, I once overheard a boy exclaim to his friends that he had to go back home for a minute. Had he forgotten to lock up? Had he left his rail ticket behind? No. 'I forgot me blade,' he explained to his sympathetic mates. But are there no reasonable grounds for taking pleasure in a well-designed pocket knife? If not, it is a pity. For they combine form and function in a thoroughly satisfying way. They are useful for picnics, for sharpening pencils, for opening parcels. The best-known example is the Swiss army pen-knife. Top chef Raymond Blanc chose one as his luxury item on the BBC radio programme Desert Island Discs. He actually owns a red one, which he was given by his eldest son several years ago; he uses it for such diverse things as cutting branches and opening bottles. 'It's a comfortable companion,' he says. These are the only pocket knives sold by Harrods, the London department store - for reasons of safety, or tact? - and they are available in a huge range under such names as Spartan, Camper, Climber, Huntsman and Explorer. Buck &amp; Ryan, the splendid ironmonger in central London, also has them at competitive prices and they are sold, too, in such fancier places as designer Paul Smith in Covent Garden. Victorinox, a Swiss family firm, has been making them ever since winning a contract to supply the Swiss army in the 1890s. The quality of the workmanship is excellent. Yet, as knives, their aesthetic qualities are nil, even for those with only a few extra functions. Those with dozens of appendages - the thick SwissChamp has more than 30 - are positively grotesque. Nor do the stainless steel blades take a good edge. The other most fashionable pocket knife is Opinel. Of a similar antiquity, these knives also are alpine in origin and they are impressively functional. The handle is wood, the curved blade high-carbon steel. A simple but effective safety ring twists round to lock the blade in position. Closed, it does not quite disappear into the pleasingly shaped handle; extended, it makes a nice line with the wood. The knife is very light and has a pleasantly rustic quality. Opinel knives come in many sizes and they are cheap. They werepopular in France before Britain, and some fancy versions have been devised. You can buy them with stainless steel blades (shinier but blunter) and stained wood handles (pretty in green, red, yellow or blue). Prices range from Pounds 3-4 up to around Pounds 12. Again, Buck &amp; Ryan has a full range, or you can get them from Oggetti, Conran or Authentics. Both Victorinox and Opinel are distributed widely. Beyond this, though, it gets more difficult to find good knives. Conran sells a number of small, ugly specimens from Japan, all shiny metal ('vanadium stainless steel') at Pounds 19.95. Knives, needing to fit the hand, do not work well to a modernist machine aesthetic. Far and away the best modern knife is Puma, based in Solingen, Germany. . These are made from quality steels tested to a high degree of hardness; the designs are at once wholly functional and elegant. Some use 'Sambar staghorn' or 'Rio-jacaranda hardwood' for the handles, but the most attractive are actually those made of a tough plastic called Micarta. The basic Puma knife, with this handle and a rear-locking mechanism, looks neat folded in on itself. Opened, it has a sinuous line from handle to blade. It feels entirely solid: you could split a lobster on the beach without difficulty, or skin a bird. To some eyes, its plain lines make it look disturbingly like a weapon rather than a tool. To others, it is a thing of beauty. Puma knives, ranging in price from Pounds 40-50, are available from Authentics in Covent Garden, London. Authentics also sells the prettiest of all knives, the Laguiole, a traditional French shepherd's knife still made in the beautiful Aubrac mountains of the Aveyron. They have a handle of horn made into a thin, elegantly undulating shape and riveted on to brass, which seems to wrap around the pointed blade. Opened, this is much wider than the handle, which obviously exists only to support it. On the better versions (usually numbered individually), the steel back of the handle is chased with a foliage design and capped with a bee. There is no actual lock, but the blade snaps crisply into place and feels quite safe for the fingers. Laguiole knives are found easily in France but are hard to track down here in the UK. Conran seems to sell one but, on inspection, this 'Larguiole' knife (Pounds 21.75) does not fold, and has a wooden handle and no edge. It turns out to be a paper knife. Max Pike's Bathroom Shop in central London sells two sizes: a 9 cm horn version with a single blade for Pounds 37.50, and an 11 cm specimen (with a blade, a corkscrew and a spike for loosening knots, prising open tops, cleaning a horse's hoof or a myriad other tasks) for Pounds 69. Both prices include mail order. Authentics has sold out of Laguiole knives but expects to get a new delivery in three to four weeks at prices from about Pounds 10 up to about Pounds 35. It is worth examining each one individually. Unlike Puma knives, which are machine-made and perfect, these have the feel of a craftsman's work, good or bad. Philippe Starck has produced a kind of trendy dolt's version of the Laguiole, made smoothly all over in stainless steel but keeping the shape (Pounds 99 from Authentics). It is a homage of a sort. In France, pocket knives are remarkably fashionable. They decorate the pages of all the better women's and decor magazines. That they are seen in the UK mainly as offensive weapons is just another of the ways in which the yobbishness of our popular culture impoverishes us all. Buck &amp; Ryan, 101 Tottenham Court Road, W1P 0DY; Paul Smith, 41 Floral Street, WC2E 9DG; Oggetti, 135 Fulham Road, SW3 6RT; Conran, 81 Fulham Road, SW3 6RD; Authentics, 42 Shelton Street, WC2H 9HJ; Max Pike's Bathroom Shop, Unit 5, 4 Eccleston Street, London SW1.</p>

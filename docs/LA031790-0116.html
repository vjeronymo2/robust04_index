			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHOLESALE PRICES STABLE AS ENERGY COSTS DECLINE;  </P> <P> ECONOMY: THE UNDERLYING CORE RATE OF INFLATION -- WHICH EXCLUDES THE VOLATILE  FOOD AND ENERGY COMPONENTS -- SETTLED AT 3.7%, A SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT.  </P> <P> The unexpected surge in energy costs that drove wholesale prices up so  dramatically in January reversed itself last month, returning inflation to the  relatively moderate pace that prevailed during most of 1989, the government  reported Friday.  </P> <P> After soaring 13.6% in January, largely because of a record cold spell that  caught fuel suppliers short, energy prices plunged 5% in February as the winter  weather thawed and demand eased.  </P> <P> Food prices, which also spurted in January as a result of the freeze, rose more  slowly in February.  </P> <P> The bursting of January's "price bubble" left the Labor Department's overall  wholesale price index unchanged during February -- offsetting at least part of  a 1.8% rise recorded in the January surge.  </P> <P> Analysts said energy prices most likely would continue declining during March.  </P> <P> The index showed the underlying "core" rate of inflation for the three-month  period that ended in February -- a more stable measure of inflation that  excludes the volatile food and energy components -- at an annual rate of 3.7%,  a slight improvement from the previous period.  </P> <P> Inflation at the retail level is running a bit higher, at annual rates of 4% to  4.5%.  </P> <P> January's 1.8% rise was the biggest jump in wholesale prices of any month since  the early 1970s. However, analysts shrugged it off at the time, predicting --  as it eventually occurred -- that the "price bubble" would prove temporary.  </P> <P> Economists were optimistic after Friday's report. Donald Ratajczak, a Georgia  State University economist, said he had "been looking . . . to see if we can  find any early warning signals of higher inflation, and it seems we aren't  finding any."  </P> <P> Friday's report left the overall producer price index in February at 117.4% of  its 1982 base-period -- meaning that it took $11.74 to buy the same cross  section of goods last month that cost $10 in 1982.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve Board reported separately that industrial  production rose 0.6% in February, rebounding from a 1% drop in January that had  stemmed primarily from layoffs in the auto industry. However, that industry  continued to suffer through one of its worst periods in recent years.  </P> <P> Although auto assemblies rose sharply in February, overall output was 10% below  its level of a year ago.  </P> <P> Lynn Reaser, economist for First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles, said the  slowing of wholesale prices of crude materials and intermediate goods reported  Friday reflected continued weakness in the industrial sector.  </P> <P> Also Friday, the Commerce Department said housing starts fell 7% in February,  in part because the cold weather that swept the country during the month  delayed apartment construction in some regions.  </P></p>

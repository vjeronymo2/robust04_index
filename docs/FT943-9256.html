			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Littlechild bids 3% in power poker game: Electricity review aims to cut costs; Investment plans reduced; Dividend growth predicted The new electricity price controls announced yesterday emerged after what can only be described as a high-stakes game of poker between the electricity industry and its regulator, Professor Stephen Littlechild. The aim of the review was to bring down electricity bills by forcing electricity companies to become more efficient and cut costs. But the consultations between Prof Littlechild and company managements inevitably focused on where and how cost savings could be achieved. It was in the companies' interests to exaggerate their costs and to convince the regulator that it would be difficult to bring them down. It was up to the regulator to call their bluff, then set targets which were demanding but fair. After more than a year of consultation and bargaining his key conclusion is that companies should be able to cut their costs by 3 per cent a year on average - slightly less in sparsely populated areas to allow for unavoidable costs such as the extra expense of distributing electricity. He originally proposed 4 per cent, but was persuaded that this was unrealistic. The 3 per cent level, which some companies still think is too high, compares with the 2 per cent annual cost saving target recently set for the water industry, which is generally judged to be more bloated than electricity. Prof Littlechild also decided to cut the companies' investment plans. These showed large increases over past budgets, and, with a total Pounds 6.2bn for the five years up to 2000, seemed to be more than was required to maintain and expand the system. So he trimmed them by 10 per cent to Pounds 5.6bn overall, with some companies suffering cuts of 25 per cent. He also put the companies' cost of capital at 7 per cent. Although Prof Littlechild says that he used evidence from a variety of sources to determine this statistic, he does not say how he actually reached it, other than to note that it is in the middle of the 6.5 per cent to 7.5 per cent range which has been proposed for British Gas. The level set for water was 5 per cent to 6 per cent. In setting the price controls Prof Littlechild decided that some electricity companies had already reaped greater rewards than others from efficiency improvements. So he divided them into three categories with progressively tougher targets. But companies and analysts complained yesterday that it was not clear how he had selected the 'winners and losers'. Mr Nick Pink, analyst at SG Warburg, said: 'The result is a fudge'. The last stage in the process was to decide whether to introduce price cuts all at once or over a number of years. The outcome - big cuts of 11 per cent to 17 per cent in the first year followed by a succession of small 2 per cent cuts - is essentially a compromise, although it also suits the electricity companies because they can afford to take a big hit now, and will then have easier targets in the more uncertain future. Many factors complicated the process. One is the National Grid Company, which the electricity companies own jointly but intend to sell next year. The value of this company, estimated at up to Pounds 4bn, and the effect of disposal on the companies' balance sheets had to be taken into account. So did the fact that full competition will be permitted in the electricity market in 1998, after which price regulation should have less meaning. However, Prof Littlechild has decided to extend the new regime up to 2000 because he believes it needs that long to have its full effect. A further factor is the strong possibility that electricity companies will merge or be taken over now that the uncertainty of the review is out of the way. Prof Littlechild seemed unclear yesterday about how this might affect the controls on companies involved. Although the regulator's main aim was to trim prices which he believed had reached unacceptable levels, he also had to bear in mind the return for shareholders. He thinks there is enough leeway in the new controls to allow companies to continue to pay adequate dividends. This was certainly the view of the stock market, where analysts were predicting strong real growth in payments to shareholders. The one issue on which Prof Littlechild was powerless to take direct action was the most inflammatory of all - chairmen's salaries. By unfortunate timing his announcement coincided with newspaper headlines on the Pounds 1m pay-off for Mr Bryan Weston, the two-days-a-week chairman of Manweb. Executive salaries 'were a matter for the companies, not the regulator,' he said. But he stressed that his new controls assumed that companies would have to cut wage bills, and any extravagant pay deals would have to be at the shareholder's rather than the consumer's expense.</p>

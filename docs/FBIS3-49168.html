			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A joint statement was issued and a meeting between  President Tudjman and President Izetbegovic was announced in  Vienna at the talks between the Croatian and Bosnia-Herzegovina  delegations headed by Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic and  Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic. Jozo Curic reports from  Vienna.    [Curic] Minister Granic and Prime Minister Silajdzic are  holding talks with cochairmen Owen and Stoltenberg. At around  1300 the two delegations ended this round of talks, which was  held in preparation for the Geneva conference scheduled for 18  January. Both sides accepted a peaceful political resolution of  the crisis. The talks were constructive despite a difficult  situation on the ground. Both sides acknowledged the situation  and the danger of a wider escalation of the conflict. Croatia  firmly insists on Neum and is against [granting the Muslims]  access to the sea near Prevlaka, which the cochairmen proposed.    A joint statement was coordinated and issued. Both sides  confirmed that an urgent cease-fire, a permanent cessation of  hostilities, and a permanent normalization of relations between  the Croat and Bosniak peoples in Bosnia-Herzegovina, including  territorial, political, humanitarian, and other aspects of a  permanent resolution, were in the long-term and strategic  interest of both peoples and the two states. In light of this,  it was agreed that Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and  President of Bosnia-Herzegovina Alija Izetbegovic should meet in  Bonn on 8 January 1994.    Special attention at the talks was devoted to the need to  fully and consistently respect previous cease-fire agreements,  particularly because of the situation in central Bosnia. The  two sides confirmed that in preparing for the summit, efforts  would be made to prepare a comprehensive plan for implementing  the cease-fire along the entire front line and ending all combat  operations to create conditions for a permanent cessation of  hostilities, the protection of the population, and the  implementation of confidence-building measures, the joint  statement says.    Both sides confirmed that the disputes on territorial  demarcation should be resolved only by peaceful, political means  without the use of force and in accordance with the Sarajevo  declaration dated 12 November 1993. As far as humanitarian  issues are concerned, it was agreed that a commission for  humanitarian issues should meet on 7 January to reach an  agreement on free movement of humanitarian convoys, including  discussion on establishing new routes as well as securing the  evacuation of the wounded and providing permanent supplies for  hospitals. It was agreed to provide all necessary guarantees  and documents for free passage of a field hospital for the  eastern [Muslim-held] port of Mostar by 6 January. It was also  agreed that the commission for exchange of prisoners should meet  on 11 January. A meeting of the Mostar commission should be  held on 7 January in the headquarters of the UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Forces] Spanish battalion in Medjugorje to prepare a  program for the revitalization of Mostar and the return of  citizens of Mostar to their city, in keeping with agreements  reached at the last round of negotiations in Brussels. The  agreement on the establishment of a free port zone in Ploce was  confirmed.    We should also mention that for the first time proposals  were  put forward for the bilateral demarcation of the two republics  [Herceg-Bosna and Bosnia]. The proposals are different but they  represent a basis for more concrete talks. The Muslims have  demanded sovereignty near Neum and the Croats have firmly  rejected this. There are areas about which the two sides could  negotiate bilaterally, without the third side. A meeting with  the cochairmen, Owen and Stoltenberg, is in progress.</p>

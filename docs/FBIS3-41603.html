Participants in the expedition  were Russian and foreign scientists and representatives of the  RF [Russian Federation] government's Committee for Conducting  Special-Purpose Underwater Operations (KOPRON). The data that  was brought back does not simply say, but shouts, that it is  necessary urgently to raise, if not the entire submarine, at  least the missiles with nuclear warheads.    A PLUTONIUM LEAK IS POSSIBLE AS EARLY AS NEXT YEAR    As long as two years ago Igor Spasskiy, the general designer  at the Rubin KB [Design Bureau], and the father of the  Komsomolets, stated that the sea water had ``cracked'' the  torpedo heads and the nuclear warheads had ``started to leak.''    After the most recent expedition returned, KOPRON chairman  Tengiz Borisov announced an even more threatening situation and  the possible leaking of plutonium into the sea as early as late  1994.    Tengiz Borisov says, ``As early as a couple of days after  the  Komsomolets went down, it became clear to me that this was  possibly the prelude to a much more serious catastrophe. Once,  in the North, a barge to which a titanium submarine had been  moored for four months sank before my very eyes. It was even  thought that that had been an act of sabotage. But when the  barge was raised, it turned out that, while it had been in an  ideal condition above the water line, below the water line it  had been `eaten away' like Swiss cheese. And it was only at that  time that people began thinking for the first time about  electrochemical corrosion.''    ``The Komsomolets also has a titanium hull, and in the  presence of titanium other metals are subjected to corrosion at  a very great speed. The designers, of course, stipulated an  electrochemical shield, and it operates excellently, so long as  the submarine is operating normally. But as soon as the  submarine is filled with water, it immediately becomes a  galvanic cell. And, according to the most modest estimates, a  current of the order of 500 amperes is generated on the hull.  The speed of the corrosion is greater than the usual speed by a  factor of the order of 1.5-2 -- that is the finding of the  academy's Institute of Physical Chemistry. On average, the water  eats through 0.2 mm a year, but in the presence of titanium, as  much as 20 mm.''    The 1991 expedition revealed the presence of a radioactive  background -- that is, within 2.5 years. True, the traces of  radiation were insignificant. But the most terrifying thing was  that it was discovered that the torpedo tubes had been damaged,  and the warheads with the plutonium were in contact with the  water. Plus the tremendous breaks in the hull.    Last year's expedition confirmed the worst fears: the  warheads had actually broken apart, and in at least three  torpedo tubes with nuclear warheads there is a long trail of  products of corrosion. And it is only the design of the charge  itself that, so far, is keeping the plutonium in the warheads.    A month ago, for the first time, the telescopic ``hands'' of  the MIR-1 and MIR-2 deep-water bathyspheres made their way  inside the submarine and took water samples for analysis. And an  attempt was also made to raise a rescue chamber with the remains  of the ship commander and several crew members. Unfortunately,  because of the stormy weather, the cable broke as the rescue  chamber was just 200 meters from the surface, and the chamber  sank...    NYeG [NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA] DOSSIER    Most specialists agree that the leakage of plutonium  into the sea, with regard to the force of its effect upon the  environment, could prove to be much more frightening that the  Chernobyl catastrophe. Nuclear leaks on land can be localized,  if only theoretically, but in water it is impossible to collect  the radioactive elements.    For the time being, fortunately, no leakage of  plutonium has been recorded. But when it does get into the water  -- and there are several kilograms of it in the torpedoes --  that will be too late. That amount is sufficient to make the  Norwegian Sea unsuitable for fishing for hundreds of years.    ``The situation is worsened by the fact that it is rather  complicated to detect plutonium. Very precise analyses are  needed. Plutonium does not have natural gamma-radiation, but  only alpha-activity. And in order for the instruments to  indicate its presence, it is necessary to have the precision of  a sniper to get to the place where, at the particular moment,  there are considerable accumulations of it.''    ``The ship lies within a 200-mile zone of Norway's economic  interests. And if -- God forbid -- the Norwegians catch even a  single herring with traces of plutonium, the area will be closed  to fishing. The half-life of plutonium is 24,000 years. Taking  into consideration the mixing of it with sea water, and its  washout, that period is 600-700 years. We will have to pay  hundreds of millions of dollars of compensation... I daresay  that those amounts of money are not comparable with what is  currently necessary to raise the ship.''    CARRY OUT THE PLAN AT ANY COST?    According to T. Borisov's data, at the present time there do  not exist, anywhere in the world, the technical means capable of  raising the Komsomolets. Moreover, there is only one ship that  is capable of sealing it off -- the American ship Glomar  Challenger.    More than 20 foreign companies are ready to finance both the  raising of the submarine, and the work of sealing it off, which  the committee is planning to carry out no later than next summer.    Finally, the method of doing this has been selected.    NYeG DOSSIER    A large number of technologies were proposed, but as of  this moment none of them has been fully developed or approved.  In addition, there is no longer any time for this    The proposal was made to fill up the submarine with  concrete. But in that instance it will be impossible to remove  the warheads from it. Also, how will the concrete behave under  the conditions of those depths and the salty sea water? No one  knows. The plans to encase the submarine in a sarcophagus also  failed.    The biotechnologists of the Sitek SP [joint venture] of the  Far Eastern Branch of RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences] proposed  their solution. In September 1992 the scientists patented in the  United States ``a method for isolating radioactive materials  submerged in a water environment,'' with the aid of the  biopolymer chitosan. The substance, which up until now has been  used only in medicine and in the processing of waste products,  is obtained from chitin -- the basic component of the shells of  shrimp and crabs. Chitosan is one of the best adsorbents and  excellently traps the ions of heavy metals. In a mixture with  other components it forms a gel which, upon entering the water,  turns into a hard sponge -- it is not damaged by washout or  corrosion.    It is proposed to pump this substance under pressure into  all  the capacities of the sunken submarine. The radioactive elements  that previously leaked through the cracks in the hull and in the  torpedoes will be absorbed by this material. Taking into account  the use of chitosan to ``catch'' the heavy metals for up to 80  percent of its own weight, the nonleakage of radioactive  elements is guaranteed, because their weight is never compared  with the weight of the solution.    Incidentally, by no means everyone agrees with this plan.  Some scientists, without denying that the sources of  radioactivity have to be raised as quickly as possible,  nevertheless express their fear: won't the reactor, to which the  access of water will be closed, explode? That is why they  propose using the chitosan to fill up only the reactor  compartment and the torpedoes, and to cut them out of the  submarine in sections and raise them to the surface. It is  easier and quicker to do this than to attempt to raise the  entire submarine from the tremendous depth.    But Tengiz Borisov gives these arguments:    ``Technology with the use of chitosan makes it possible to  encase any ship at a depth of as much as 8000 meters -- with a  safety guarantee of a minimum of a hundred years. Of course that  is not enough. But it will be necessary to await the appearance  either of new technology or new techniques. Or, if quantity  makes the transition to quality, to build a special ship for  this job.''    There is one more paradox. Unlike our specialists, our  Western colleagues worry more about the reactor than they do  about the warheads. Some of them who also participated in the  expedition on board the Mstislav Keldysh assert that the  Cesium-137 from the reactor which appeared in the water analyses  and the plutonium from the warheads settle excellently in the  mud at the bottom of the sea and constitute absolutely no threat  of ``killing'' the Norwegian Sea. And they cite a large number  of examples with sunken reactors -- both ours and theirs.    At such time, for some reason, they fail completely to take  into consideration the Russian data to the effect that  sea-bottom currents that have not yet been explained have been  discovered in the area of the Komsomolets -- currents with a  speed of up to 1.5 meters a second. Periodically, underwater  gales occur in this area.    In our country one can also hear voices stating that  everything is not really so frightening, and that Borisov is  just attempting to get more money for his committee by stating  that the submarine has to be sealed off not only within the near  future, but also at any cost...    It is difficult for us journalists to evaluate disputes  among  specialists. We are convinced of one thing: it is only in work  that experience is accumulated. The proponents of raising the  submarine have one more iron-clad argument with which it is  difficult not to agree: it is necessary, to the extent possible,  to raise the submarine in order to analyze the causes of the  catastrophe and to avoid its repetition.    In confirmation of this argument the chairman of the RF  government's Committee to Conduct Special Underwater Operations,  captain first rank, experienced submariner and scientist Tengiz  Borisov, says, ``I, as a career military man who has served on  submarines, doubt that within the near future submariners will  be threatened by unemployment.''    P.S. It is proposed to carry out the operations to seal off  the submarine next summer, after first using a Dutch cutter to  cut away the forward compartment in exactly the place where the  missiles with the warheads are located. NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA  GAZETA pledges to keep you informed about the course of these  operations.</p>

			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / International Company News: Westpac continues search for new chief executive SHARES in Westpac, the troubled Australian bank, closed 6 cents lower at ADollars 2.79 yesterday after the board failed to meet its self-imposed deadline for the appointment of a chief executive. Mr John Uhrig, chairman, told the annual meeting that the board was still considering a small group of candidates to replace Mr Frank Conroy, who resigned in December after a boardroom row. Mr Uhrig said 30 candidates had been contacted after an international search by a firm of executive headhunters. The shortlist is believed to be headed by Mr Lindsay Pyne, former chief executive of the Bank of New Zealand. The announcement disappointed the financial markets, and exacerbated criticism from more than 5,000 shareholders at the biggest annual meeting ever held in Australia. Several shareholders claimed the board was unable to correct Westpac's bad-debt problems, which caused the bank to post a record ADollars 1.5bn (USDollars 1.1bn) net loss for the year to the end of September. Five directors, including the then-chairman, resigned in October following the failure of shareholders to support a ADollars 1.2bn rights issue, which closed 72 per cent undersubscribed. However, there was no intervention at the meeting by Mr Kerry Packer, the entrepreneur and investor who resigned from the board last week after failing to force through a radical cost-cutting programme. Mr Packer, proprietor of the privately-owned Consolidated Press Holdings publishing group, owns shares and options equivalent to about 10 per cent of Westpac stock. Mr Uhrig said Mr Packer's resignation was 'unfortunate'. He added that the board 'knows there is a need for drastic change,' but directors would not proceed at a pace which would damage the bank. Mr Uhrig said Westpac's net profit in the first quarter of the current financial year was in line with the result in the comparable period of the previous year. However, the chairman warned shareholders that the bank's previously-announced restructuring plan, which includes up to 8,000 redundancies, would have a 'short-term' cost. Mr Uhrig apologised to shareholders for the board's 'prudent' decision to cut the dividend from 24 cents to 18 cents. However, he was subjected to a barrage of abuse from some shareholders, one of whom told the board: 'I am here to apply the blowtorch to your bellies.' After eight hours' debate, the meeting was adjourned until next week. An independent director proposed from the floor was elected on a show of hands, but is expected to be defeated in a formal poll. Advance Bank, a small Sydney-based bank which was formerly a building society, said interim net profits increased by 38 per cent to ADollars 28.4m in the six months to the end of November. The directors increased the interim dividend by 6 cents to 20 cents, fully franked. Advance shares closed 26 cents higher at ADollars 6.36 on the Australian Stock Exchange.</p>

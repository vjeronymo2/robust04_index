Josef Schwarz, Austrian trade  delegate to Budapest, told DIE PRESSE in Vienna that investments  there have reached 11.5 billion schillings.    Austrian companies have been particularly active as far as  the privatization of Hungarian enterprises is concerned. The  State Privatization Agency has so far sold 328 major public  enterprises for 176.3 billion forints (the equivalent of about  21 billion schillings) to foreigners, of which Austrian  investors have bought 96 enterprises for 43.8 billion forints  (5.3 billion schillings) -- that is to say about 25 percent.    The managing president of the Hungarian Joint Venture  Association, Ivan Toldy-Osz, told DIE PRESSE in Sopron that some  18,000 joint ventures and 100 percent subsidiaries by foreign  companies have been registered in Hungary.

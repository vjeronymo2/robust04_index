			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Anatoliy Belousov: "Military Councils Change </F> Work Style. What Is New About It?"]    [Excerpts] Military councils have always existed. Or, at  least, they have existed since the olden days. In all wars,  there have always been occasions when military leaders have  deemed it necessary to submit their plans for upcoming battles  for discussion with their commanders. But right until the  17-19th centuries, commanders and commanders-in-chief only  convened military councils occasionally. Remember, for example,  the famous military council convened by M.I. Kutuzov in Fili  [village outside Moscow] in 1812. [passage omitted]    In accordance with the Russian Federation president's edict  dated 1 September 1993, which ratifies the Statute on Military  Councils, these have been given the status of permanently  operating consultative organs. They are formed in the Armed  Forces, the Border Guard, Internal, and Railroad Troops, and  government communications troops. In addition to commanders of  the relevant formations, whose deputies belong to the councils  ex officio, and also other officials from organs of military  administration, the Russian Federation president includes  representatives of state structures in them.    One of the main tasks of the present-day military councils  is  to elaborate recommendations in spheres such as maintaining the  troops in combat and mobilization readiness, strengthening  organization and discipline, and the selection and placing of  personnel. But after all, even in the past these questions were  frequently reviewed at sittings of military councils. So what  has changed? Let us look at practice.    The Strategic Missile Forces which, incidentally, started to  elaborate a state-of-the-art concept of the activity of military  councils even before the decree currently in force was issued,  carefully analyzed their work in formations, and then turned to  the archives and discovered an interesting detail. The same  shortcomings were revealed as had existed three, five, and even  10 years ago. The basic spheres of the work of the military  councils in the operational echelon were determined from above  by circulars. The standard set of mandatory questions moved  from one plan to the next, and decrees were adopted on them.  But the main point is that when attempts were made to find  traces of their practical implementation in the relevant  services, these were not discovered. That is, the same  "collective responsibility" stamped its mark on everything -- in  reality, collective irresponsibility.    In order to break the vicious circle, the attitude to the  planning of the military councils' work needed to be changed  first and foremost. Of course, programmed areas of the troops'  activity exist, and their examination may be recommended from  above. But the main point is that the commander, like the  chairman of the military council, should have a free hand,  because he knows his formation's problems better than other  people do.    The actual sittings, the majority of which are visiting  sittings, have also started being prepared in a new way. They  are held directly in divisions and units. Practical studies on  the questions being discussed are being conducted in parallel  with commanders and chiefs of services. Urgent measures to back  up combat training and the troops' vital activity are also  adopted on the spot.    But it is known that even the best decisions may remain on  paper only if a mechanism for their implementation is not worked  out. That is why the orders and directives being issued on the  results of the work of military councils and being sent to the  appropriate services and Strategic Missile Forces directorates  also contain provisions enabling the adopted decisions to be  implemented.    A constructive attitude to work is also characteristic of  the  military council of the Ground Forces. Let us take the problem  of protecting the lives and health of the personnel. The  measures being adopted in the troops have made it possible to  reduce the number of injuries among the personnel by 39 percent  last year, and the number of deaths by 28 percent. However, the  military council was not satisfied with this. At its recent  sitting, it elaborated specific recommendations for the  accident-free use of equipment and weapons in order to reduce  injuries to people. The question of ensuring the safekeeping of  weapons and ammunition, which is directly linked to this, was  also examined. With the great shortage of manpower, there has  been reliance upon the more intensive commissioning of security  equipment and facilities at military installations and weapons  dumps.    However, military councils' tasks in the present conditions  are not just limited to internal problems in the troops. Every  military formation is stationed on the administrative territory  of a specific republic or kray, and the implementation of  Russian Federation normative acts and the social and legal  protection of the servicemen depends in many respects on how  well the work of the military councils with the local  authorities is organized. Measures such as the organization of  the defense of the territories, the region's communications,  mobilization, and the draft to military service, and military  training courses cannot be resolved by either local authorities  or military formations on their own. And what about strictly  everyday questions?! A kray or oblast counts on the military's  assistance in the gathering of the harvest, and the latter, for  their part, ask for housing to be subsidized.... The list of  problems which must be resolved by both is long, but the whole  question is how resolvable they are at all amid the current  shortage of everything -- both for the military and for the  local authorities.    Nevertheless, it turns out that if the will is there you can  achieve a lot. The activity of the military councils of the  Moscow, Volga, North Caucasus, Urals, and certain other  [military] districts confirms this. The coordinated work of the  councils with the organs of representative and executive power,  as well as -- and this is also very important -- good personal  contacts, make it possible to settle a lot of vitally important  questions. This is not just limited to mutual services, if you  can put it like that: We give you apartments, you give us a  work force. Concern for invalids and veterans of war and labor,  the establishment of ties of sponsorship between enterprises and  military units, the military-patriotic education of young people  -- these things are classed as state-level.    Of course it is six months since the military councils have  been working the new way, which is not a very long period of  time, but it seems that this is long enough for the first shoots  of the new work to be seen. Experience suggests that a military  council should specifically be a council of the military, as it  was conceived at the very beginning. As such it will raise the  prestige of the commander and will make it possible for his  personality to be revealed, and it will strengthen the positions  of one-man command. As such it will be in a position to  elaborate genuinely necessary recommendations on all important  spheres, ranging from the practical implementation of military  policy in the troops and fleets, to ordinary everyday concerns.</p>

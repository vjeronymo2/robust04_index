			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / International Company News: BZW earnings calculation BARCLAYS de Zoete Wedd, the City security house, has announced how it will calculate earnings per share under the new accounting standard. It will issue its own operating earnings per share figure which excludes profits or losses on business disposals, asset sales and fundamental restructurings. The announcement is one of several beginning to appear from City firms attempting to grapple with FRS 3, the new accounting standard which becomes mandatory for companies with year-ends after June 22. FRS 3 provides a profit figure which includes extraordinary items previously taken below the bottom line, and will be considerably more volatile than the existing profits figure. County NatWest has already announced its method of calculating a continuing earnings figure, and a group of City analysts has put together a working party to consider a version which might be adopted as the industry standard. BZW says it will begin publishing its own earnings figure alongside the reported earnings in its circulars. The figure will be reached by taking published operating profit, subtracting net interest, tax, preference dividends and minority interests, and adding back tax and minority interests attributable to fixed asset and business disposals, closures and restructuring.</p>

			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Branson says apology from BA 'falls short' MR Richard Branson will decide next week whether his Virgin Atlantic Airways will take any further legal action in the US courts against British Airways. Virgin said yesterday it had received 'an extremely brief confidential note' from BA which fell short of the the 'act of good faith' it was seeking from its larger UK rival to show it had changed its attitude. Mr Branson, who yesterday met Mr John MacGregor, the UK transport secretary, is also seeking a commitment from the government to fair competition in the UK airline industry after the victory in the High Court last week in his 'dirty tricks' libel battle against BA. The ball was now in BA's court, a Virgin official said yesterday, explaining that Mr Branson would review next week all options about action, if any, he intended to take. Virgin's next move would depend on the response of BA. Its board is understood to have met to analyse the impact of the Virgin affair which is now under board investigation. A further meeting is expected this week. Non-executive directors led by Sir Michael Angus, the president of the Confederation of British Industry, have expressed determination to establish the extent of the 'dirty tricks' campaign against Virgin and to ensure nothing similar happens again. Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chief executive and deputy chairman, has also said BA wanted to establish a less confrontational relationship with Virgin. In his talks with Mr MacGregor yesterday, Mr Branson pressed for the establishment of a regulatory body to ensure fair competition in the allocation of take-off and landing slots at London's Heathrow airport. Mr Branson has campaigned for more slots at Heathrow to expand Virgin's long-distance international services in competition with BA. He now hopes to use his victory in the courts to press his case. Virgin officials said yesterday that the airline's expansion plans had been frozen for the past 18 months because it was unable to secure more peak-time slots at Heathrow. In turn, Virgin last year put on ice plans to sell a 20 per cent stake in the airline to fund its expansion. The company said these would only be resurrected if it could secure the slots to expand its services.</p>

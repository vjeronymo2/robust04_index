			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Somali peace talks end in deadlock UNITED NATIONS-chaired Somali peace talks ended last night in deadlock, with the 15 participating clan-based factions reaching no agreement and with acrimonious charges made against the UN by Somali warlords. Delegates said informal talks would continue today after Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, left Addis Ababa. The move reflected the determination of four allied factions to stall any successful agreement while the conference was still under UN sponsorship which might reflect positively on the UN chief. Mr Boutros Ghali last night played down the failure of the talks and criticisms of him by some Somali factions. 'What we have achieved is not enough but it is a positive step,' he said. 'For the first time the leaders have met and mechanism has been created.' The UN chief said nobody was interested in creating a trusteeship in Somalia and he issued a stern warning to Somali leaders stalling on political reconciliation at a time when Africa was increasingly marginalised by a post-cold war world. If they were not careful, he said, the world would withdraw from Somalia and plunge the country into a worse 'drama.' 'It was not easy to obtain the involvement of the international community to help Somalia and the international community could in 24 hours just forget Somalia. Nobody is interested in Somalia. The world is no longer interested in the poor countries of Africa.' In another critical test of UN capability in ushering in a 'new world order' the UN has emerged bruised and is now faced with having to reconsider its long-term political role in Somalia. The UN and Mr Boutros Ghali have also been hard pressed to fight attempts by warlords to exploit real and imagined divisions between the UN and the US. In a statement distributed to the conference yesterday Gen Mohamed Farah Aideed, Somalia's most important warlord, said on behalf of his Somali National Alliance (SNA) that 'UN bureaucrats, from the secretary general downwards, have failed time and again to demonstrate an understanding of the intricate political problems in Somalia.' Gen Aideed attacked the organisation of the political conference by Mr Boutros Ghali and questioned the UN's ability and impartiality. Even before the conference started Gen Aideed had tried to undermine the UN. On Sunday, he organised an angry demonstration against Mr Boutros Ghali during his humiliating visit to Mogadishu. Gen Aideed and his other clan-based faction allies spent most of the conference filibustering - determined to frustrate efforts at agreement on a national political reconciliation conference. Eleven other factions had agreed to a proposal calling for the convening of the reconciliation conference within 60 days in Mogadishu, if security conditions permitted. Delegates of the 11 factions said they were increasingly frustrated by Gen Aideed's negative position and would soon consider going it alone. Meanwhile, one UN official said privately the UN was now forced to consider whether it should withdraw its political bureau from Mogadishu. 'If getting Somalis to the peace table means getting out of Somalia then we will get out.' UN officials say they are dealing with the legacy of their involvement in Somalia which has inevitably created enemies among the warlords who face losing their power base. But critics say the UN is reaping the harvest of its earlier neglect of Somalia. 'What gave Boutros Ghali, the Organisation of African Unity and the League of Arab States the right to sit on the dais and open a peace conference on Somalia?' asked Mr Hassan Mahdi, a member of the SNA delegation. 'They did nothing when we were suffering most.' Many US officials privately share the warlords' criticisms of the shortcomings of the UN. They point to their own rapid successes.</p>

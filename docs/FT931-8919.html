			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Observer: Scene for Hurd? Will Douglas Hurd's promotion to the government somersault team hasten his departure from politics? He turns 63 next month and as an ex-diplomat with a relatively young family he is not as comfortably off as some of his colleagues. It's been rumoured for some time that he would retire before the next election, and past form suggests a well-connected Tory politician, sorry statesman, should have no difficulty picking up a few handsome retainers. Lord Carrington, a former foreign secretary, went on to chair GEC, for example, and old cronies such as Lords Howe and Tebbit have picked up some nice little earners. Trafalgar House is known to be looking for a chairman, and Lonrho, Barclays and HSBC Holdings may be in the market for one in the not-too-distant future. If Hurd wants something less challenging then there are plenty of merchant banks that would welcome him with open arms. However, the natural place for him to go is not the City, even if he wants to earn some money. It would be the headship of an Oxbridge college. Lesser politicians than Hurd have gone the same way. Lord St John of Fawsley, for example, is now Master of Emmanuel College, Cambridge. So have some of the best, such as 'Rab' Butler who went on to Trinity College, Cambridge. Hurd would be at home at any high table, and the higher the better. He would also have time to write, whether memoirs or thrillers or both. His thrillers, such as Scotch on the Rocks and The Smile on the Face of the Tiger, are very good. Given time and the right environment, he might even make more money than the down-market Lord Archer.</p>

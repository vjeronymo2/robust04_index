			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: British Airways It was almost inevitable that British Airways' first quarter profits should bounce back sharply from last year when business was still severely depressed by the Gulf war. Less easy to foresee was the 6.5 per cent drop in yield per passenger kilometre. BA has not only suffered a shortfall in premium fares from business and first class passengers, it has been discounting to boost economy class volumes. The upshot may be an increase in market share, but the strategy also makes BA particularly dependent on its ability to trim its expenses. Since yesterday's figures also show it on track to cut costs by Pounds 150m in the current year, the market may have been a little negative in marking the shares down by 3 per cent. The need for discounting should abate quite quickly when economic recovery does eventually come. Even if this takes until well into next year, the chances are BA's economy programme will continue to pay off meanwhile.</p>

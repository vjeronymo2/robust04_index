			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Germany opens up public road projects The German government yesterday gave the green light for private contractors to build and operate toll tunnels, bridges and mountain passes to extend the country's highway system in an important new move to extend private-sector involvement in the public infrastructure. A draft law was approved by the cabinet in Bonn as part of the government's drive to deregulate and privatise wider sectors of the economy. It is intended to accelerate construction of road projects, such as the proposed DM10bn (Pounds 3.8bn) tunnel under the Ruhr valley, which otherwise would be delayed because of the acute squeeze on public finances. At the same time the cabinet approved plans to step up its overall privatisation programme, giving top priority to the sale of Deutsche Lufthansa, the national airline, the Rhine-Main-Danube canal operator, the Bundesanzeiger publishing house, and the state company controlling motorway service stations. The plan to step up private financing and operation of road projects, and to allow the introduction of toll charges, comes on top of a decision last year to seek private-sector financing for 12 large road projects, including the fourth tunnel under the Elbe at Hamburg. Those 12 projects, costing a total of almost DM3.9bn, would not be privately operated, but would instead be bought back by the government over 15 years after their completion, on the basis of a leasing model. Mr Matthias Wissmann, the transport minister, said the new move would extend the whole area of private involvement in the road network, although still not yet allowing construction of toll roads: the projects would be limited to bridges, tunnels and mountain passes linked to the main highway system. The government's draft law will now be submitted to the parliamentary groups of the ruling coalition to refine and send direct to parliament, in order to speed up the normally cumbersome legal process, and ensure the bill becomes law before the next elections in October. Mr Wissmann said that the plan to allow private toll operators as part of the public highway network would mean the private sector could remove expensive bottlenecks in the system. The plan was immediately denounced by the opposition. Ms Ingrid Matthaus-Maier, deputy leader of the Social Democratic opposition in the Bundestag, said it was another blatant example of the government shifting its bills to the consumer - in this case, the ordinary motorist. The rest of the government's privatisation programme may prove difficult to push through before the October elections, officials admitted yesterday. Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, said that conditions on the stock exchange, and the results of drastic cost-cutting, made the sale of Lufthansa particularly attractive. However, it depends on highly sensitive and complex negotiations on the future financing of the airline's pension funds, which may well take months to conclude. Mr Dieter Vogel, the government spokesman, would only say yesterday that the big privatisation projects would be 'prepared' rather than 'completed' in the coming months.</p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Major issues writs over magazine allegations MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday took a rare step for a serving prime minister by issuing writs for libel against two magazines. The move, announced by Mr Major's press secretary, came after reports on allegations about his private life - which Downing Street said were untrue - appeared in the current issue of New Statesman &amp; Society, a leftwing magazine, and in the January issue of Scallywag, a London satirical monthly. The statement said: 'The prime minister has today instructed solicitors Biddle and Company to issue writs for libel against the New Statesman &amp; Society and against Scallywag.' Biddle and Co said last night it had issued a writ seeking damages and an injunction for libel against the distributors of the New Statesman. Ms Clare Latimer, the woman named in the articles, has also issued writs for libel against the two magazines and the distributors. WH Smith and John Menzies announced that they were taking the New Statesman off the shelves. Ms Latimer runs a catering company called Clare's Kitchen, which has occasionally been employed for Downing Street functions. At a press conference in Oman, Mr Major refused to comment on his reasons for taking action, referring only to the statement. 'I have nothing further to add to that,' he said. But the decision to make a formal denial and then issue writs via the press secretary, Mr Gus O'Donnell, underlined the seriousness with which the prime minister apparently viewed the threat to his reputation and credibility. Only three serving prime ministers this century have sued for libel, the most recent being Mr Harold (now Lord) Wilson, in 1968. At Westminster, MPs of all parties were quick to condemn the magazines, but the effect on possible changes to press regulation is delicately balanced. The articles may strengthen calls at Westminster for a new privacy law as recommended in the Calcutt report. But the prime minister's personal involvement in a libel case may make it harder for the government to be seen as an impartial arbiter of press standards. Mr Steve Platt, editor of the New Statesman and co-author of the article, said yesterday that he did not regret publishing and was confident of successfully defending any legal action. He said the magazine was putting its trust 'in the jury's ability to see the difference between a smear and honest effort to expose it'. The decision to act was taken by Mr Major early yesterday as he flew into Oman from India. He had been told about the article the night after hosting a dinner for UK and Indian businessmen in Bombay, after which he consulted his lawyers. The statement was then issued after early morning consultations with Downing Street officials in London. Downing Street said Mr Major is to pay for the legal actions himself. It said there was no comparison with the case where the legal bill for the eviction of an unwelcome tenant from the private home of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, was shared between the taxpayer and anonymous Tory donors. Mr Major went on to meet Sultan Qaboos of Oman at his fortified royal camp in the desert about 60 miles from Muscat. Apparently good-humoured, when a photographer said the press were not using telephoto lenses, Mr Major joked: 'And I hope there is no bugging'. It emerged that contingency plans had been in place should reports of the allegations become widespread. Downing Street's denial was issued in London before Mr Major had heard about the article in Bombay. PM's recourse to law revives memorable cases, Page 9</p>

			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> NEW COLLEGE HEAD NAMED AT RIO HONDO;  </P> <P> TRUSTEE SAYS INCOMING PRESIDENT IS 'PEACEMAKER'  </P> <P> The Rio Hondo Community College Board of Trustees has chosen a University of  New Mexico administrator to replace outgoing president Herbert M. Sussman, who  has been at the center of a yearlong political struggle that has often split  the board along racial lines.  </P> <P> Alex Sanchez, a vice president at the university in Albuquerque, will take the  23-year-old community college's top post in August, college spokeswoman Pamela  Jo Cox said. Sanchez was chosen as the college's fifth president from 58  applicants. Four finalists were under consideration for the $91,800-a-year  position.  </P> <P> In interviews last week, trustees said that they hoped the appointment of  Sanchez, 54, the community college's first Latino top administrator, would help  end the public debates among trustees over the direction the college should be  taking.  </P> <P> "I saw a peacemaker, a healer," trustee Marilee Morgan said, "someone with a  great deal of community outreach, a lot of integrity and sincerity."  </P> <P> The board's three Latino trustees have often sparred with the two Anglo  trustees, charging that the college has not done enough to hire minority staff  members and work with promising college students in the heavily Latino  communities that surround the north Whittier campus.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Students 53% Latino  </P> <P> Rio Hondo College, with a student population of about 25,000, serves the cities  of Whittier, Santa Fe Springs, South El Monte, El Monte and Pico Rivera and  parts of Norwalk, La Mirada, Downey, La Puente and the City of Industry, Cox  said. About 53% of students are Latino, according to college records.  </P> <P> "I saw that Dr. Sanchez's credentials were outstanding," board President Hilda  Solis said. "After meeting with him, I felt like the chemistry was good."  </P> <P> Sanchez, Solis said, appeared willing to meet with community leaders to develop  programs to draw young Latinos into college. About 6% of Latinos who attend a  community college in the state transfer to a four-year university, according to  college records.  </P> <P> Sanchez's appointment ends a controversial search process that started last  year, after Latino trustees Solis, Bill E. Hernandez and Ralph S. Pacheco  complained of "philosophical differences" with Sussman, who was hired in 1982.  The three in October voted not to extend Sussman's contract, which expired  Friday.  </P> <P> Solis has said that Sussman, 65, has not had the interests of the community in  mind. "We've had very poor relations with the president," Solis said. "We were  constantly at battle with Mr. Sussman over issues of community involvement."  </P> <P> "He has a brash personality," Pacheco said last week. "In terms of management  style, Mr. Sussman didn't meet the expectations of the majority of the board.  He could be capricious and arbitrary."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Two Supported Sussman  </P> <P> But Anglo Trustees Morgan and Isabelle B. Gonthier, both longtime board members  who hired Sussman from the San Francisco Community College District, have  supported Sussman's performance.  </P> <P> "Herb is a great president," Gonthier said. "He has done some great things for  Rio Hondo College. Those good things will continue on for years to come. I'll  miss his leadership style."  </P> <P> Morgan agreed with her longtime colleague. "Herb has had a great deal of  vision," Morgan said, noting that previous boards had no problems with Sussman.  "We did not have that type of dynamic before."  </P> <P> Hernandez was elected to the board in 1983, Solis in 1985 and Pacheco in 1987.  Solis and Gonthier are up for reelection in November, and Morgan will be  retiring from the board after 14 years.  </P> <P> Sussman, who has been a college administrator in California, Pennsylvania and  New York for the past 25 years, will remain at Rio Hondo College as a full-time  instructor, teaching classes in human anatomy, he said.  </P> <P> "There are no sour grapes here," Sussman said in a telephone interview after  the announcement that Sanchez will replace him. "In fact, I'm happy." Sussman  said he had made a decision to step down as president -- effective when his  contract expired Friday -- before the board majority decided it could not work  effectively with him.  </P> <P> The board had initially voted 3 to 2 in July, 1988, to buy out Sussman's  contract and replace him a year before his scheduled retirement. The buyout  would have cost the district more than $100,000.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Agreement Not Reached  </P> <P> But after three months of negotiations, attorneys for Sussman and the district  could not work out an acceptable agreement, school officials said. The board  later decided to allow Sussman to remain until his contract expired.  </P> <P> "We handed him a 14-karat handshake," Pacheco said. "But he wanted an 18-karat  handshake. The negotiations never panned out."  </P> <P> The debate over Sussman came as trustees were wrestling with other issues, such  as affirmative action, student recruitment, off-campus education, and the  decision to hire a Latino law firm to represent the college. In each issue, the  three Latino board members and the Anglo trustees disagreed.  </P> <P> Although trustees have expressed hope that the acrimony has subsided, the  political struggle among board members may be far from over, some school  officials said privately. For instance, the trustees were split 3 to 2 on the  decision to hire Sanchez, even though most staff members described the New  Mexico native as the best person to serve the heavily Latino communities  surrounding the two-year college. But this time, the dissenters were Pacheco  and Hernandez.  </P> <P> Pacheco and Hernandez favored Los Angeles Community College District  administrator Frank Alderete, who grew up in Southern California and knows the  Latino community.  </P> <P> Also among the finalists were Donald Jenkins, assistant president of Rio Hondo  College, and Raul Cordoza, an administrator at East Los Angeles Community  College.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Search Teams' Advice  </P> <P> Solis, Morgan and Gonthier, relying on the almost unanimous advice of the  presidential search teams, voted to ratify Sanchez's contract.  </P> <P> Sanchez, an ex-U.S. Air Force officer, holds a bachelor of science degree and a  master of arts degree from the New Mexico College of Agriculture and Mechanic  Arts. He is an expert in media relations, according to a biography issued by  the college press office.  </P> <P> He has worked in the University of New Mexico system since 1979.  </P> <P> Sanchez said that he hoped that his efforts to work with the community will  allay fears that the Latino communities will not be overlooked. His wife, Amey,  will be working closely with various community leaders, he said.  </P> <P> Sanchez said he plans, among other things, to upgrade the college's bilingual  education program. But he added: "We are going to have to take a comprehensive  look at everything."  </P></p>

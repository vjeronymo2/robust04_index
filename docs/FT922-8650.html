			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / UK wins sympathy but little support on frontier checks BRITAIN yesterday won some sympathy from its European Community partners on the political sensitivity of immigration, but got little support for its refusal to stop checks on non-EC citizens entering the UK from elsewhere in the Community after this year. The controversial issue was discussed by EC foreign ministers, meeting in Brussels. The discussion, however, did nothing to close the rift over the issue. The EC Commission and most EC states want all controls on travel within the Community to end next year, whereas Britain contends that free travel rights apply only to EC citizens. Controlling non-EC citizens requires, necessarily, some checks on EC citizens. Only Ireland, which effectively has a passport union with the UK, yesterday expressed some oblique support for Britain's position. Dublin is worried that, if it follows the EC majority in dropping intra-EC controls while the UK does not, a new barrier will be erected between the UK and Ireland. Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, said London's difference with its EC partners was long-standing and rooted in geography. As an island nation, 'there are possibilities open to us to control movements at airports and seaports which are not open to others', he said. The UK has agreed to sign a convention strengthening the EC's external frontier, at present stymied by a dispute with Spain over how it would affect Gibraltar. But UK ministers say it might be years before such an external control gave the UK the confidence to abandon checks on passengers arriving from other points in the EC.</p>

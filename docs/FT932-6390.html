			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Hammerson There was no doubt Hammerson needed a rights issue. Having lost Pounds 1bn of shareholders' funds since 1989, Hammerson had to strengthen its balance sheet somehow if it was not to be forced into selling its better properties at silly prices. The old management's record scarcely allowed it to tap shareholders for fresh funds. Just 27 days into the job, the new chief executive clearly did not suffer the same predicament. The Pounds 199m proceeds will help Hammerson preserve value, with Pounds 60m being used to spruce up its existing portfolio. But the main rationale was simply to stop Hammerson's finances deteriorating further. Gearing will fall from 114 per cent to 69 per cent. The cut dividend will be secured. Yet these are meagre attractions when set against a 14 per cent dilution in net assets - especially at a time when other companies are raising cash to buy cheap properties to fuel income growth. Hammerson's cash call is an opportunistic attempt to exploit the groundswell of favourable sentiment towards the property sector as a whole. The trouble is that the sector's principal appeals hardly apply to Hammerson. Asset values will fall further this year while its dividend yield languishes. Moreover, 60 per cent of its portfolio is overseas, frustrating those seeking exposure to the UK's incipient upturn. Fund managers will surely soon tire of stumping up funds on the basis of such skimpy stories. That, though, may simply prompt other straitened property companies to jump in quick.</p>

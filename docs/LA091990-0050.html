			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PILOT DOING STUNTS BEFORE FATAL CRASH  </P> <P> A 62-year-old pilot appeared to be performing aerobatic stunts at too low an  altitude when his homemade plane crashed and killed him, federal investigators  were told Tuesday by witnesses to the Poway accident.  </P> <P> William Herman Parrigin of Lakeside was flying the the single-engine RV-4 when  the crashed occurred about 5:30 p.m. Monday at the east end of south Poway  Parkway.  </P> <P> Witnesses who were watching Parrigin's stunts said he seemed to be only about  600 feet above the ground.  </P> <P> Federal flight laws for aerobatic flying say that the plane should be at least  1,500 feet above ground, said Jeff Reynolds, an investigator for the Federal  Aviation Administration.  </P> <P> "I saw him about 30 seconds to a minute before he went down," said Scott  Jennette, an aerospace analyst who was standing outside the General Dynamics  plant about half a mile from the crash site. "I saw him do about two barrel  rolls and then he just took a nose dive straight to the ground."  </P> <P> Investigators still must examine the aircraft further and conduct additional  interviews with witnesses before making an official determination on the cause  of the crash.  </P> <P> After striking the ground the plane apparently skidded across a dirt field and  went over an embankment, where it broke apart, said Mike Kolesar, a production  control supervisor at General Dynamics who drove out to the site after he  witnessed the crash.  </P> <P> Parrigin took off from Gillespie Field in El Cajon just after 5 p.m. He never  radioed that he was in trouble or needed help, said an air traffic controller  in the airport tower.  </P> <P> Parrigin began buying sections of the airplane piecemeal in 1984 and  assemblying it, said Dick Smith, general manager of Van's Aircraft Inc. near  Portland, Ore., the company that sold Parrigin the parts.  </P> <P> The Federal Aviation Administration certified the plane as airworthy in 1986,  Reynolds said.  </P> <P> An RV-4 is a small two-person plane made of sheet metal that reaches a top  speed of 205 m.p.h. It has a wing span of 23 feet and a length of just more  than 20 feet, Smith said.  </P> <P> Authorities are uncertain where Parrigin was headed when he took off from  Gillespie because he was not required to submit a flight plan, Reynolds said.  </P> <P> But witnesses said the area where Parrigin crashed is known as a haven for  pilots to do stunt flying as well as chase each other around in the air in mock  "dog fights."  </P></p>

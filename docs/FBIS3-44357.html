			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 1 (XINHUA) -- China today bids  farewell to the official exchange rate for good.    The People's Bank of China, the central bank, published at  seven this morning [2300 GMT] what it calls the market rate  which sets one dollar against 8.7 renminbi yuan.    This is yesterday's average price of U.S. dollar at the  government monitored foreign exchange swap markets in major  Chinese cities.    The exchange rates between Chinese yuan and the other major  foreign currencies have also been readjusted accordingly.    Yesterday's official rate was 1: 5.8 between U.S. dollar and  yuan.    An official with the State Administration of Exchange  Control  (SAEC) said that the rate is set with reference to the swap  market rate.    "Before the inter-bank foreign exchange market is  established  and goes into operation, the swap market rate will be an  important and reliable reference since it basically reflects the  market demand and supply and has been accepted by the general  public," the SAEC official said.    He noted that the rate also conforms to the latest changes  of  main hard currencies in international financial markets.    "It's relieving to see that the unified exchange rate of the  first day is that close to the swap market rate," said Tao  Liming, a financial expert contacted by XINHUA through telephone.    "It will boost the confidence of the public in the yuan and  can be accepted by enterprises since most of them have long been  running business at the swap market rate," said Tao who heads  the International Finance Research Institute under the Bank of  China.</p>

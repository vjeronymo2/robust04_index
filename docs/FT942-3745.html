			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Major plans cabinet reshuffle: Labour celebrates best national election performance since 1960s Mr John Major signalled plans last night for a wide-ranging cabinet reshuffle next month to provide a fresh start for the government after its European elections defeat. As the Labour party celebrated its best performance in a national election since the 1960s, the prime minister said he was determined to fight off any challenge to his leadership. Amid bright sunshine in the garden of 10 Downing Street, Mr Major underlined a commitment to stick with his present policies in spite of what he acknowledged had been a 'very poor' set of results. But, acknowledging the need for new blood in the senior ranks of the government, he gave a clear hint that a reshuffle before the summer parliamentary recess would be more radical than hitherto imagined. He also, in an apparent rebuke to rightwing cabinet ministers, said everyone in the government would now abide by an agreed neutral line on UK participation in any single European currency. Ministers said they did not expect a 'night of the long knives' in mid July. But Mr Major may replace four or five of his present cabinet team, leading to large-scale changes lower down the ministerial scale. The prime minister faced renewed pressure from friends to persuade Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, to take over as Conservative party chairman. Insisting that strengthening economic recovery was taking the government above the low point in its fortunes, Mr Major dismissed any threat to his position. Pressed on whether he might face a challenge in the autumn, he replied: 'I don't expect one. I will be here waiting for it if there is one. I will beat it and I will be here through the general election.' His press conference among the rose bushes of Downing Street's garden came amid jubilant Labour claims that the victory in the European poll marked a 'watershed' in its long march since 1979 back to electoral respectability. Mrs Margaret Beckett, the interim Labour leader, said sweeping gains in southern England demonstrated that Labour had won the 'mantle of trust' from the Conservatives. Despite winning its first seats in the Strasbourg parliament, Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats saw their vote fall sharply in response to the Labour surge. An estimated 45 per cent share of the vote gave Labour 62 seats; the Conservatives held 18 seats with 28 per cent; and the Liberal Democrats two with 16 per cent. The Scottish Nationalists won Scotland North East from Labour to give it two seats. Mr Major joined Mrs Beckett in agreeing that the outcome marked a return to 'two-party' politics. With Labour almost certain to elect Mr Tony Blair as its next leader, the Liberal Democrats face the threat of more defections to the rival opposition party. Mr Major faced an uncertain mood on the Tory back benches amid renewed indications of sharp divisions over economic policy and over Europe. Ministerial hints that the Treasury should have room before the general election to cut taxes fuelled demands from rightwing MPs for Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to scrap some of the increases already pending. Among those likely to stand down or face dismissal in the reshuffle, ministers last night singled out Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, Mr Peter Brooke, the heritage secretary, Mr John Patten, the education secretary, and Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary. Allies of Mr Major also want him to sack one the cabinet's right-wing Eurosceptics in order to reassert his authority.

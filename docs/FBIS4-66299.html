			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by staff reporter Chung He (4429 0735): "1994: </F> Pudong's Year of New Image; Interview With Zhao Qizheng,  Shanghai Deputy Mayor and Director of the Pudong New District  Administrative Committee"]    [Exerpts] Pudong, a resplendent, bright pearl rising in the  east! Since Deng Xiaoping made his important speech during his  inspection tour of southern China, it has changed every year,  and every three years, it has changed greatly, displaying its  strong vitality and developmental staying power, becoming a new  growth spot and comprehensive trial zone for developing  Shanghai's economy. It has received wide and close attention  from everyplace, both overseas and domestic, and especially in  financial, investment, enterprise, and transportation circles.    With the coming of the new year of 1994, in order to gain a  deep understanding of the new achievements and new steps in  developing Pudong, and answer some questions raised by Hong Kong  and overseas people concerning that development, a delegation  headed by the Director of our magazine XIE MINGGAN [6200 2494  1626] recently made a special trip to Shanghai to interview the  Deputy Mayor Zhao Qizheng, who is in charge of Pudong's  development.    Deputy Mayor Zhao met Xie Minggan's group in a tastefully  decorated guest room in Pudong's New District Administrative  Committee. Outdoors it was harsh winter, but indoors it was as  warm as spring. The host and his guests chatted cheerfully and  humorously. Deputy Mayor Zhao is very busy in his work, but he  is an energetic and quick-witted person. He is very familiar  with Pudong development, and after exchanging a few words of  greeting, we came to our topic.    Question: In 1993, Pudong New District tried to strengthen  its general supportive function for city construction on a base  of stressing doing well the job of developing the role of key  small districts, strengthening comprehensive treatment of social  development, as well as making further exploration of developing  the operation of the socialist market economic system. Please  outline 1993's achievements in these areas.    Answer: On New Year's Day 1993, the Shanghai government  established the Pudong New District Administrative Committee to  speed up Pudong's development and implement comprehensive and  unified administration for the new district. During the year,  Pudong New District has developed rapidly in various areas.    (1) There was a great deal of growth in the domestic  economy.    --The gross domestic output value has achieved "doubling in  three years." Last year, the gross domestic output value in the  New District reached 16.4 billion yuan and, if calculated by  comparable prices, it increased 100 percent since 1990 and 30  percent since 1992. Meanwhile, service industries have been  increasing at the same rate as the gross domestic output value.  Last year, the increased value of service industries reached  4.66 billion yuan, a 46.6 percent increase by the same rate,  higher than that of secondary industry.    --Fixed asset investment increased one-fold over 1992. The  investment mix tended to be more reasonable. Construction of the  city's infrastructure and the rate of investment in service  industries increased significantly.    --Financial income increased at the same rate as the gross  domestic output value. Last year, the district level financial  income took in 1 billion yuan in the New District, which was a  more than 70 percent increase over 1992.    --The financial ability of financial organs in the New  District increased one fold. Last year, the balance from  deposits and loans in 10 domestic banks Pudong branches was over  50 billion yuan, a one-fold increase over 1992, which showed  fully the significant achievement of the strategy of "finance is  first" in Pudong development.    (2) Overall achievements in urban construction.    Enthusiastically helped the city to complete such big and  important projects as the Yangpu bridge, the Pudong section of  the inner circle, two massive interchanges, the new port zone of  Waigaoqiao, the Linqiao water works, etc.    Paid close attention to projects for widening and remaking  seven backbone roads such as Yuanshen Road and Longdong Road  which connect small development districts and major municipal  works. The total length is 20 Km, with total investment of 1.2  billion yuan. After working day and night for half a year, it  was finished completely in December of last year, which further  improved the environment for investment in Pudong.    (3) Key small districts in the New District have entered a  new stage of functional development.    In keeping with the State Council's strategic decisions  concerning Pudong's development and opening, last year we set  out new development objectives for fostering and strengthening  functional development in each key, small, development district.  At present, construction is fully under way on 50 financial and  trade buildings in the Lujiazhui Finance and Trade Zone, an  emerging, embryonic form of China's CBD zone; the 200 projects  imported to the Jinqiao Export Processing Zone are listed as  number one among all development zones in China from their  average investment of US$15 million per project. In addition,  the production rate of 30 projects has put them into a  profitable phase; the Waigaoqiao bonded zone has $2.3 billion  total investment from foreign business, and the Shanghai bonded  production materials market, the largest such in China, has gone  into full operation; the Zhangjiang High Technology Zone is also  following closely, with mutual development of each key, small  district's support function, creating the conditions for the New  District to accomplish its historical mission.    (4) Strengthened comprehensive treatment of social  development in the New District.    The New District gives considerable attention to building  moral civilization and comprehensive social treatment, insisting  on anti-corruption, advocating honesty, and promoting legal  construction. First of all, we established the Chuansha Police  Office, and hired 14 legal specialists and well known lawyers to  make up a legal consulting group for the New District; the Labor  Department in the New District adopted positive reform measures,  arranging appropriately compensation for farmers whose land was  taken for the New District; as for the social problems brought  on by a large number of migrants, the New District promptly  researched countermeasures, strengthened administration, and  vigorously went after a small number of criminals to guarantee a  stable social environment for developing and building Pudong.    (5) Positively studies the establishment of a socialist  market economic system of operations.    This includes, primarily: centered on the strategic goal of  building up Shanghai as an international economic, financial,  and trade center, the New District has enthusiastically invited  foreign capital banks to establish branches in Pudong, and  attracted international capital through multiple channels (there  are now 26 foreign capital branch banks, and foreign capital or  joint venture financial corporations). The first one established  was the Waigaoqiao bonded production materials market (to date,  there are four branch markets). We established a State-owned  assets administrative corporation in the New District, to  strengthen administration of State-owned assets. We have  enthusiastically developed a personnel market and a technology  market, and experimented with the reform of an agricultural  cooperative joint stock system.    Question: You have proposed that 1994 should be Pudong New  District's "year of image-making." Could you tell us what kind  image will Pudong have before the world in 1994?    Answer: We call 1994 our "year of image-making," because  Pudong has a three step goal of laying a foundation by 1995,  forming the primary framework by 2000, and then establishing  ourselves as an international economic, financial and trade  center by 2010, so the primary image for the "foundation" of  1995 should make its general appearance in 1994. Primarily, this  means:    --The image of infrastructure: while there will be  support for the major and important municipal works associated  with the eastern and western parts of the city, the key lies in  10 infrastructure projects in the New District, including  supporting projects in the Pudong section of a double line  tunnel, an axial highway, the project to widen Zhangyang Road,  around the periphery of the river, and a group of interchanges,  transformers and substations, etc., add 200,000 cable TVs and  170,000 telephones and a group of gasoline stations. This will  basically establish a networked system of modernized  transportation, telecommunications and energy, displaying the  primary framework of a modern urban area.    --The image of municipal appearance and  environment: focusing on the 10 fundamental municipal works  already completed during the Eighth Five Year Plan, we will  begin a comprehensive project of afforestation and environmental  protection around the tourist routes and major scenes in Pudong.  We will especially increase forest construction, starting to  build such forestry projects as Central Park, Dezhou Park, etc.,  adding 2 million square meters of wooded areas in the new  district. This will further improve the municipal appearance and  environment of Pudong New District.  ---The image of the new city center area: in 1994,  on the other side of the Bund, the Eastern Shining Pearl TV  tower and the first section of Bingjiang Avenue will be  completed, and construction will start on Fudu World. Meanwhile,  more than 30 buildings around that area will reach over 40  meters of their major structure on the ground, and nearly 20  buildings will be completed. This will give Pudong's new Bund a  beautiful appearance.    ---The image of a modernized processing zone for  exports: in the Jingqiao processing zone for exports, six  square km of "seven throughs and one flat" will be developed and  built, which will bring in a total of more than 300 domestic and  foreign capital projects. There are now 200 projects under  construction, and nearly 100 enterprises including Hitachi  Electric and Sharp Air Conditioning, have finished construction  and gone into production. This has achieved a yearly output  value of three billion yuan, becoming the processing base for  export with the shortest construction cycle, richest technical  content, fastest economic efficiency, and best environment  protection in China.    --The image of a free trade zone: in 1994, in the  Gaoqiao Bonded Zone, construction will end on 6 square km of  "seven throughs and one flat," and a 4 square km area will be  closed and put into operation. For the more than 1,000 Chinese  and foreign capital enterprises which are engaged in entrepot  trade, or international trade, the volume of their import and  export business will be double that of last year. The Shanghai  bonded production materials exchange market has been formed to a  certain degree, with a focus on steel, construction materials  and textile raw materials.    --The image of commercial culture: the Wendeng  Road commercial street will be finished comprehensively, forming  the New District's first street for tourist sightseeing and  shopping. Covering 600 thousand square meters, equivalent to  about two Nanjing Roads, its commercial facilities are under  accelerated construction. Meanwhile, a group of projects  consisting of a newly established elementary school, high  school, hospital, welfare facility and sports center, a golf  course, etc., have gone into construction. In the Zhangyang Road  and Huamu areas, these will create a brand new image for the  Zhangyang Road commercial center, developing and building an  attractive commercial, tourist and cultural center, complete  with municipal government, culture, and central park.    Question: In 1994, the Chinese government will implement  important reforms in the tax system. What affects will these  have on Pudong New District's development and construction? Will  the environment tend to be loose or tight?    Answer: On 1 January, 1994, China launched tax reforms in  areas dealing with foreign investment enterprises, abandoning  unified industrial and commercial taxes, implementing a value  added tax, a consumption tax, and a business tax. The principal  objective is to simplify the tax system and correspond to the  international tax system.    Internationally, and especially in the developed nations of  the West, a value added tax is collected on the value added part  of goods sold; while China formerly collected a uniform  industrial and commercial tax on goods sold by foreign  nationals' enterprises, the tax linked to goods sold could not  be deducted directly within the borders of China, but would have  to be waived or returned to customers or import-export organs in  accordance with the regulation of duty free or tax return. This  way takes a long time, has many steps, and is quite complicated.  Now, having our system in line with the western tax system will  totally resolve the problem of deducting and returning the tax.    After the new tax system has taken effect, the Chinese  Government will adopt certain measures to protect the profits of  foreign businesses. We have already made it clear that to ease  the added tax burden tax reform causes for foreign enterprises,  within a certain period we will adopt such measures as tax  rebates, temporary delays in collecting the tax, etc. This will  enable foreign investment enterprises to maintain their former  tax burden, and not increase the circulating tax burden.    In addition to this, Pudong New District will not make any  changes in the preferential income tax policies for foreign  investment enterprises and foreign enterprises. Therefore, the  Chinese Government's major reforms in the tax system will be  favorable for regulating the investment environment in Pudong  New District, giving it a better investment future.    Question: How about the scale of the enterprises investing  in  Pudong New District with the three types of capital? What have  you done to attract the world's famous transnational  corporations to invest in Pudong, and what do you plan to do in  the future?    Answer: At the end of 1993, Pudong New District had approved  a total of 1,625 enterprises invested with foreign capital,  having a gross investment of $6.546 billion, and agreements to  absorb $3.269 billion in foreign capital, with a per enterprise  average investment of $4.02 million with the three types of  capital, and $2.01 million agreed to on absorbing foreign  capital. This makes us fourth nationally, and higher than the  average investment level ($2.3 million). Among these, 178  enterprises invested with the three types of capital have over 5  million dollars' gross investment, constituting 10.9 percent of  the total foreign invested projects in Pudong, 65 percent of the  gross investment, and is up to $4.255 billion. There are 117  enterprises which have over $10 million gross investment,  constituting 7.19 percent of the total number of projects, 59.03  percent of the gross investment and is up to $3.864 billion. At  the end of 1992, the average project had 45 percent foreign  capital content, while in 924 projects approved throughout 1993,  the average foreign capital content had increased to 55.3  percent. [passage omitted]    Question: Currently, land leasing in Pudong still mostly  takes the way of approving leases through agreement. From now  on, will you go the way of inviting vendors or auction, which is  more common in the world, bringing land to full efficiency in  market competition?    Answer: We always persist in valuing land as if it were  gold.  Since establishing the New District Administrative Commission,  we comprehensively strengthened land development administration,  and initiated a chargeable land using system.    In Pudong New District, development and construction on  whole  pieces of land is generally done through investment by the city  government or the New District Administrative Commission, and  chiefly by state-owned corporations buying the land from the  state, conducting "seven throughs and one flat" construction on  it, after which there is another transfer. In addition, a small  amount of land is directly approved for rental to foreign  business and their domestic associated enterprises. To date,  nearly 50 square km in whole parcels of land have been taken and  transmitted by the six big state-owned development corporations,  and one-third of these have completed development.    In 1993, in order to strengthen land administration, we put  a stress in our land management work. By persisting in approving  land according to the projects and approving projects according  to their efficiency, we achieved orderly land development, with  basically no land available for "land speculators."    While chiefly going the way of approving leases to transfer  lands, we are breeding the means of inviting vendors or auction,  which are common throughout the world. In the first part of this  year, we will extend initial invitations to vendors on a piece  of land about 6 thousand square meters (Zhangyang Road 23-G).  We are now preparing the plans for this.</p>

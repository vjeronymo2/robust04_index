			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / UK group wins water contract NORTH West Water has won a Pounds 285m 10-year contract to provide water services for more than 2m people in Mexico City. The company said yesterday that this deal was the biggest of four announced over the weekend as part of a drive to save water. Mexico City, the world's most densely populated city, relies on an underground aquifer for its water supply. At current rates of extraction, the aquifer could be exhausted by the turn of the century. North West will have 49 per cent of a Mexican joint venture company set up to administer the contract, which covers nearly a third of the city, including the most affluent western residential area. Its partner is Grupo Gutsa, one of the biggest construction groups in Mexico. Each will subscribe equity to a maximum of Pounds 2m. Three further consortia have won similar contracts for other parts of the city. One is led by Severn Trent, another UK water company, while the two others are led by the French groups Lyonnaise des Eaux and Generale des Eaux. Mr Bob Thian, North West's chief executive, described his company's project as 'one of the most challenging' in the water industry. The company estimates that a further Pounds 100m of revenues could come later in the project, when infrastructure is refurbished. Work will begin later this year, when the company will draw up a computerised map of the 264,000 water connections in its area. It is expected to take two years to install meters to double the income of the city's water authorities.</p>

			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Not just a case of going to the dogs - Michael Skapinker reports on a sport ripe for a modern image On a grim weekday afternoon, a crowd of several hundred has gathered at the Hackney Stadium in east London to watch the greyhound races. Robert Parker takes in the shabby wooden benches, the grubby linoleum floors and the faded advertisements on the walls. 'It's like a time warp,' he says of the stadium he and a group of investors acquired yesterday from the Brent Walker leisure and property group for Pounds 5m. A year from now, Parker says, Hackney will be the most advanced greyhound track in the UK. Renamed London City Stadium, it will have luxury dining facilities, corporate boxes and a children's playground. The sport's insiders are watching Parker, a veteran racing writer and trainer, carefully. If he succeeds, they say, he could begin to reverse a 30-year decline in greyhound attendances. There are UK greyhound tracks with better facilities than Hackney. Walthamstow, in north London, is regarded as one of the best, with trackside restaurants and brightly-lit stands. Even Walthamstow, however, falls short of what Parker has in mind. He wants jazz bands performing in the intervals between races and the dogs greeted with a fanfare of trumpets. 'His is a venture the likes of which has not been seen in this country before,' says Geoffrey Thomas, deputy secretary of the British Greyhound Racing Board. As part of a master of business administration degree at Sheffield Business School, Thomas last year wrote a dissertation on the marketing of greyhound racing in which he castigated the industry for offering 'a 1920s sport in a 1990s market'. Not much had changed, he said, since greyhound racing started in the UK in 1926. Although stadiums now have more seats and more areas behind glass, they look pretty much the same as in the 1930s. Of the 37 stadiums controlled by the greyhound board, 23 were built before the second world war. 'Even those built after bear a striking resemblance to their predecessors,' Thomas said. In its early years, greyhound racing provided the post-first world war urban working-class with the excitement of a novel spectacle and the opportunity to gamble legally. By the early 1930s, 18m spectators were attending meetings annually at 220 racecourses. By 1948, attendances had reached 25m. In the 1950s, however, the sport began its decline, dogged by doping scandals, criticisms from animal welfare groups and, above all, the growth of other leisure alternatives. By 1970, annual attendances had fallen to 7m. Last year, fewer than 5m visited greyhound tracks. Managers feared their customers were too old. Peter Shotton, who runs two courses owned by Bass, the brewing and leisure group, remembers a marketing exercise he did for a previous employer a few years ago. 'I told them we needed to attract 12 per cent of new customers over the following year because 12 per cent of our customers were going to go senile or die.' There are glimmers of hope, however. Research carried out in 1990 by a tobacco company showed signs of the sport widening its appeal. Despite Shotton's worries, the proportion of greyhound racegoers under 35 increased from 36 per cent in 1967 to 50 per cent in 1990. The social class of racegoers also changed, with the number in the AB category doubling from 6 per cent in 1967 to 12 per cent in 1990. Despite the fall in attendances, greyhound racing is still the second most popular spectator sport in the UK after football. Parker and Thomas believe that to attract new spectators, greyhound racing needs to market itself as an enjoyable night out rather than merely an opportunity to see dogs running. They see an improvement in facilities as a start. Greyhound racing has another advantage - the growing presence of women and children among its spectators. Perhaps due to their civilising presence, both Hackney and Walthamstow are free of the menace and aggression of a pub or a football crowd.</p>

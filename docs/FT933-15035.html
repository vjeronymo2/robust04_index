			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions AN ELEMENT of uncertainty has surrounded quoted nursing home companies because of proposed changes in community care funding. But this has not stopped Quality Care Homes from producing a very strong share price performance since its stock market debut last July. Duncan Bannatyne, managing director, has now sold 300,000 at 265p just after announcing interim results which showed a healthy increase in earnings over last year. But he retains more than 9m. Directors in Control Techniques have a history of deft timing when trading in their own shares. Clement Wheatley, chairman, bought 72,000 at just under Pounds 2 in March last year while his colleague, Professor Pat McKeown, a non-executive director, bought 4,000 at much the same price some six months later. Neither has yet decided to take his profit but managing director Kevin Curran has chosen this moment to sell 100,000 at 337p. The shares have virtually doubled over the past seven months, and even over a 12-month period they have outperformed the market by approximately 35 per cent. When interim results were announced at the start of June, the chairman revealed that overall order bookings were up 20 per cent compared with the same period last year. We rarely record open market purchases by directors in Marks &amp; Spencer, but this week is an exception. Philip McCraken bought 10,000 at 345p.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                              No of Company                 Sector     Shares     Value      directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Amersham Intl             Hlth    45,000       358           2* Bentalls                  Stor    20,000        20           1 Berkeley Group             C&amp;C    10,112        40           1 Betterware                Stor    15,500        38           1 Bowater                   Pack     8,000        39           1 Bradstock                 InsB   245,000       338           3 Control Techniques        Elns   100,000       337           1 FII Group                 Misc     5,870        26           1 Govett Oriental           InTr    50,000       142           1 MacFarlane Group          Pack    22,000        41           1 Meggitt                   EngG    79,669        85           1* Quality Care Homes        Hlth   300,000       795           1 Rowe Evans                Plan   100,000        53           1 Staveley Industries       OthI   103,689       236           1* Syltone                   EngG    34,038        92           1 Vaux Group                Brew    89,740       206           1*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Astec (BSR)               Elns   150,000        95           2 Coutts Consultg Grp       BuSe    75,000        31           4 F &amp; C PEP Inv Trust       InTr    20,000        22           1 Iceland Group             FdRe     9,896        24           2 Invesco                   OthF    30,000        35           1 Marks &amp; Spencer           Stor    10,000        35           1 Quadrant Group             H&amp;L   800,000       144           5 Suter                     OthI    20,000        31           1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

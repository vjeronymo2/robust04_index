			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev -- The visit by President Leonid Kravchuk to  Kharkov oblast ended on 6 June. There, together with Viktor  Yushchenko, chairman of the board of Ukraine's National Bank,  Yuriy Karasyk, Ukraine's minister of agriculture and food,  Industry Minister Anatoliy Holubchenko, Mykhaylo Kovalko,  chairman of the state oil and gas committee, and others, he  familiarized himself with the work of the Zmiyev vegetable  processing plant and held talks with the president's  representatives in the oblast rayons, the chairmen of local  councils, and managers of agricultural enterprises, and also a  consultation with representatives of Ukraine's gas industry.    "The most topical problems needing immediate resolution are  agrarian issues, issues of foodstuffs, and power, the president  of Ukraine said. We should support everything that works to  produce food." As far as the issue of trade with CIS countries  is concerned, Ukraine, according to Leonid Kravchuk, was the  first to propose a treaty on free trade between these countries.  This treaty should envisage equal conditions for the  participants of a free trade zone. The Ukrainian position  differs from the position of the Russian side, which insists  that oil, gas, gold (approximately 100 types of goods), be  excluded from the free trade zone, that is so that the Russian  consumer can buy these goods 2.5 times more cheaply than the  Ukrainian consumer.    According to information from Viktor Yushchenko, chairman of  the board of Ukraine's National Bank, it is now necessary to  refuse as much as possible an emission solution for rural  problems [as heard]. It is also necessary to introduce normal  pricing and a nonemission financial and credit mechanism, to  improve settlements and currency regulation, change quotas and  licenses in agriculture, and also to set up support funds for  the sector by attracting investments.    According to Yushchenko, current seasonal inflation is 10-12  percent compared to the 38 percent each month last year.    According to Yuriy Karasyk, Ukraine's minister of  agriculture  and food, 10 percent of our state's credit resources will in  future go on agrarian projects, and a crediting mechanism will  be elaborated at the expense of the state stabilization fund.    Leonid Kravchuk noted at the consultation with  representatives of Ukraine's gas industry that a program is  being prepared to develop Ukraine's own energy-carriers, which  envisages the extraction of 25-30 billion cubic meters of gas  per year. "We are capable of resolving these problems with our  personnel and industrial level. All that remains is to find a  source of finance and equipment, and to make scientific and  technical plans. In future it may be about attracting foreign  investments, especially when mastering the Black Sea Basin," the  president of Ukraine said.</p>

			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / UK Company News: SelecTV to turn broadcaster with launch of cable channel SelecTV, the independent television production company that makes Lovejoy and Birds of a Feather, will launch a cable TV channel within the next few months. The general entertainment channel will draw on the 300-hour library of programmes made by SelecTV, combined with acquired programmes. Two cable companies have already agreed to take the new channel. Mr Alan McKeown, SelecTV's chief executive, believes most members of the Cable Communications Association, the industry trade body, will distribute it. The channel, which will run for 59 hours a week - 5pm to midnight on weekdays and longer hours at the weekend - is due to launch in the first quarter of next year and will be 'cable exclusive'. The cable industry is keen to improve the range of its programming, partly at least to differentiate itself from satellite television and to make itself less dependent on British Sky Broadcasting. A cable-exclusive news channel for London, Channel One, was launched recently and Mirror Group is planning a channel based on live events next year. The move to being a broadcaster will mean SelecTV losing its independent producer status, and so its programmes will not count towards the 25 per cent independent production quota required by law for the four main broadcasting channels. Mr McKeown believes it is essential to be a broadcaster in order to have an outlet for programmes. Channel One and Mirror Group's Live TV are believed to have negotiated cable subscription deals of 25p a month for each subscriber. The SelecTV channel will get about 22p or 23p a month. So, even though audiences will be small and advertising revenues tiny, there should be an immediate revenue stream .</p>

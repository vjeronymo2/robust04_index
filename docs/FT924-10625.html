			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Grindlays admits breach of rules ANZ GRINDLAYS BANK, the Australian-owned group involved in the Bombay stock market scandal, has admitted its Indian subsidiary broke regulatory guidelines. But the bank's executives, appearing before a parliamentary committee investigating the affair, said they had followed 'normal market practice' in the fast-growing and loosely-supervised inter-bank securities market. The Rs35bn (Pounds 800m) scandal, which erupted in April, has resulted in 15 arrests, the liquidation of two small Indian banks and heavy losses at other financial institutions, including Standard Chartered Bank of the UK. Grindlays was summoned by MPs probing the affair because it was active in the securities market and because it had done business with Mr Harshad Mehta, a leading Bombay stockbroker accused of fraud. According to Mr Ram Niwas Mirdha, the parliamentary committee chairman, Grindlays executives admitted the bank had broken Reserve Bank of India guidelines by engaging in forward trading in non-government securities when such trades were permitted only in government bonds. Mr Mirdha said Grindlays also admitted infringing regulations on the investment of funds placed by clients in portfolio management schemes. These rules said funds should be deposited for at least a year, there should be no guaranteed return and a separate account for every client. Mr Mirdha said the Grindlays team had admitted crediting cheques with a value of Rs5.34bn to Mr Mehta's account even though they had been made payable to Grindlays itself. Grindlays executives said the bank had acted in accordance with 'oral instructions' from Mr Mehta. This, Grindlays said, had been in line with market practice. Most of the cheques were issued by the National Housing Bank, a central bank subsidiary which suffered heavy losses in the scandal and is now demanding the return of Rs5.06bn from Grindlays. Grindlays, which claims it has not suffered any significant losses, has been ordered by the central bank to repay National Housing Bank. Grindlays is resisting and wants the dispute settled through arbitration.</p>

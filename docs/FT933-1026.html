			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Tax watchdog FOR THOSE with a gripe about their tax affairs, the Inland Revenue has an answer: its adjudicator. A new leaflet describes the role of Elizabeth Filkin, the Revenue Adjudicator and former consumer advocate, whose appointment was announced earlier this year. The idea behind the Revenue adjudicator was to provide an independent channel for complaint by those who feel aggrieved at the way they have been handled by the Revenue or its Valuation Office Agency. It does not deal with disputes over the amount of tax to be paid. It does not remove the right of taxpayers to use other methods of complaint. But it does provide a new channel for arbitration. Examples of concerns it will handle include excessive delays, errors, discourtesy and the way the Revenue has exercised its discretion in tax negotiations. Taxpayers should initially give the Revenue the chance to settle a complaint itself by contacting the person in charge of the office or unit concerned. Failing that, the next approach should be to the Controller of that unit. The names and addresses of these are given in the leaflet. The adjudicator's service is free. The office will only consider complaints arising after April 5 this year. It will normally not handle issues sent to it more than six months after a response from the Controller to the taxpayer. Complaints can be made by phone, but the adjudicator prefers them in writing. The office can take calls to help those wondering what to include in a letter. Taxpayers should provide the name of the Revenue office involved, and ideally their tax reference and National Insurance number. They should give details of costs incurred as a result of the Revenue's action, and say how they want to settle complaints.

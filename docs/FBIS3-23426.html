			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Yemeni Vice President 'Ali Salim </F> al- Bid by Amin Muhammad Amin in Aden; date not given]    [Excerpts] Yemeni Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid has  warned that there is a plan being implemented against the Arab  nation to spread terrorism and extremism, undermine the Arab and  Islamic nation's aspirations, and isolate it from the world. In  an interview with AL-AHRAM, he said that this terrorist plan has  clear features and is targeted against Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt,  Sudan, Yemen, and other Arab states. [passage omitted]    Al-Bid said: We cannot allow Yemen to be a way station for  exporting terrorism to Egypt, because this hurts us and runs  counter to our loyalty to Egypt. It is illogical for us to  offer terrorism instead of loyalty.    All the plots and sedition being concocted against the Arab  nation are also directed at the Islamic nation. In Yemen we are  suffering from this terrorist plan opposing unity. We  discovered in time that there are several terrorist acts and  assassinations aimed at jeopardizing the march of unity.  Therefore, it was necessary to adopt a stand against terrorism  and those who support it, to protect the Arab nation's unity and  solidarity, and to find a logical formula to confront this plan.    The secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]  said that the Gulf crisis was another factor that affected the  unity of Yemen.    He wondered about the reasons for the success of some  fundamentalist calls and terrorist acts. He said that this  success is the result of the existence of basic unresolved  problems in some societies. These terrorist elements exploit  such situations. They also exploit the youths who are suffering  from a moral void and the absence of a pan-Arab concept to cling  to. He clarified that despite this, the fundamentalist formula  advocating terrorism under the slogan of the true Islamic  religion -- which in fact has nothing to do with them -- did not  gather momentum by itself. The Afghan experiment does not apply  in the Arab world. [passage omitted]    Al-Bid concluded his remarks to AL-AHRAM by saying: Some al-  Jihad members are in Yemen. I regret that some people are  dealing with these terrorists and encouraging them. Details  will become known in due time. This cooperation with the  terrorists does not serve our cause or honor it. The main  terrorist camp is found in Sa'dah in the north. The terrorists  also began to assemble in the south but we are able to pursue  these terrorists pockets and expose them. However, we find it  totally unacceptable that the terrorists should enjoy the  support of some people in power and some Army units. When they  are left without official support, it will be easy to besiege  them and get rid of them.</p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Ferguson advances to Pounds 5.24m FERGUSON International Holdings, the labels, hangers, communications components, printing and publishing group, reported pre-tax profits up from Pounds 4.7m to Pounds 5.24m in the six months to August 31. The rise was struck on turnover up from Pounds 61.8m  - of which Pounds 3.86m was from discontinued operations  - to Pounds 65.6m. Mr Denis Cassidy, chairman, called it 'a good first-half performance'. Three of the four divisions lifted operating profits, while sales grew at all four. Further, the group has secured, as successor to Mr Michael Saint, Mr Ronald Irving of Christian Salvesen as group managing director. Profits in labels, the group's main business, grew 11 per cent to Pounds 3.03m on turnover up 8 per cent to Pounds 30.2m, three quarters of which comes from the UK. Some 60 per cent of the labels are for clothes and the balance for food, though Design Mark Industries of the US, which makes pressure sensitive panels, also falls within the division. Work has been carried out to restore to profit the Hong Kong labels business, which is essential for clothing manufacturers which source from the Far East. Lower prices in Europe led to profits falling to Pounds 1.21m (Pounds 1.33m) in hangers on turnover up at Pounds 16.6m (Pounds 15.6m). Earlier this month, Ferguson bought Red Wing Products for Dollars 11.5m (Pounds 7.5m), giving the hangers side a US presence. Profits at the US cable components side were up 42 per cent to Pounds 1.02m on turnover up 47 per cent to Pounds 13.1m, though stripping out currency gains reduces the rises to 17 and 21 per cent respectively. The disposal of the printing and publishing division, which made Pounds 344,000 (Pounds 243,000) on sales of Pounds 5.61m (Pounds 5.46m), has not yet been completed. Earnings rose to 10.4p (9.3p) per share and the interim dividend is held at 4.25p.</p>

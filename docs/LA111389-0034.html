			<p><P> November 13, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CZECH TV SHOWS CANONIZATION OF NUN BY JOHN PAUL  </P> <P> Pope John Paul II canonized Princess Agnes of Bohemia, a medieval Czechoslovak  nun, on Sunday in the first papal ceremony broadcast on state television in the  Communist nation.  </P> <P> The pontiff also formally conferred sainthood on a Polish friar, Adam  Chmielowski.  </P> <P> More than 9,000 Czechoslovaks, including a government delegation, packed St.  Peter's Basilica to watch the canonization of the princess who turned nun and  laid a framework for social work in 13th-Century Bohemia, a region that became  part of modern Czechoslovakia.  </P> <P> The live, hourlong broadcast and the unprecedented move of granting travel  visas to Czechoslovak pilgrims reflected a marked improvement in relations  between Prague and the Holy See in recent months.  </P> <P> The decision to broadcast the ceremony appeared to be in line with an official  effort to prevent Roman Catholic dissent at a time when Czechoslovakia's  orthodox Communist leaders are becoming increasingly isolated from shifts  toward democracy in other eastern European countries.  </P> <P> Also canonized Sunday was Chmielowski, known as "Brother Albert." He was a  19th-Century painter of religious themes who founded hostels for the poor and  homeless. He became a Franciscan friar and established a congregation of  friars.  </P></p>

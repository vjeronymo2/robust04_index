			<p><P> February 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DREAM VERSUS REALITY  </P> <P> I read with amusement Superintendent of Schools Leonard Britton's letter  ("Blaming the Los Angeles School Board for the Labor Woes of Teachers Is  Unfair," Jan. 1) attacking Harry Bernstein's column, "L.A. School Board-Teacher  Harmony Is a Possible Dream."  </P> <P> Britton takes exception to Bernstein calling the pay docking of teachers'  salaries a "retaliation" or "escalation" by the district in the contract  negotiations, but that is in fact what it is.  </P> <P> Britton also claims that United Teachers of Los Angeles' belligerence has hurt  the trust level that is essential to resolving problems. If it is belligerent  for UTLA to point out that Britton's chauffeur was paid $90,733 last year, that  there are 100 administrators in L.A. who are paid between $85,000 and $141,000  -- more than Gov. Deukmejian, Mayor Bradley, U.S. congressmen and U.S. Senators  -- I guess we are belligerent. We feel that this information is important for  the community to understand the district has upside-down priorities.  </P> <P> Britton's final attack, when he said, "In fact, we have offered L.A. teachers a  significant power-sharing, school-based management proposal that not only  builds upon but is more comprehensive and far reaching than the system in Dade  County," is totally false. The only proposal the district has offered is for  teachers on their own time to work out proposals and present them to the  principal. Principals can veto any proposals they do not like. This proposal is  a sham and nothing like the Dade County plan, where teachers have real  decision-making authority.  </P> <P> The overall thrust of Bernstein's column was right on target. His article  speaks of Los Angeles school board-teacher harmony as a possible dream. We at  UTLA see that dream as a reality worth continuing to strive for.  </P> <P> WAYNE JOHNSON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P> <P> The writer is the president of United Teachers of Los Angeles.  </P></p>

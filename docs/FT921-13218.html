			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / International Company News: DnB to make provision of NKr5.6bn for year DEN NORSKE Bank, Norway's biggest bank, will make provisions for identified and estimated losses on loans and guarantees for 1991 of NKr5.6bn (Dollars 89.4m). DnB also announced yesterday a sweeping reorganisation into two main divisions - corporate and retail banking - in which 480 jobs would be lost and 13 domestic banking outlets closed. The bank's credit losses jumped by NKr1.8bn in the final three months of 1991, from NKr3.78bn at the nine-month stage, confounding earlier optimism for a fourth-quarter improvement. DnB said that, after the reorganisation, 630 full-time positions would be eliminated but that 150 of these would not require job losses. The bank warned that its management had the authority to 'implement lay-offs if this proves necessary to reach the required staff level'. Last month, DnB was rescued by a NKr5.9bn state-backed bail-out with a NKr3.25bn cash injection in the form of preferential capital and a NKr1.68bn state guarantee for a planned NKr2.37bn preferential share issue. Under the agreement, DnB was ordered to report its developments on a regular basis to the state-operated bank insurance fund. But the state also saddled DnB with the acquisition of Realkreditt, Norway's biggest mortgage company, which was facing technical insolvency. Mr Torstein Joerstad, a bank analyst with Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, said DnB's credit losses reflected a continuing trend of Norway's ailing banking sector. The bank already has an A-3 investment grade rating, the lowest assigned by S&amp;P. 'We are not likely to review this rating for another 18 months,' Mr Joerstad said. 'In any case, DnB will have to show sustainable, good profits and the ability to stand on its own without the prop of state subsidies while seeking to reduce non-performing loans. 'It looks like the bank has a long way to go,' he added.</p>

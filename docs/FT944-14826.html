			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Private funds for third world The private sector will provide about 14 per cent of the total infrastructure finance needed in developing countries by the end of the decade, with governments continuing to be the main source of funds, according to World Bank officials at the World Infrastructure Forum (Asia) in Jakarta. Although there is unlikely to be a shortage of cash as governments inject new life into existing infrastructure funds, 'projects will be chasing money, not money chasing projects,' said Mr Gregory Ingram, administrator of the research advisory staff at the World Bank. Capital markets are expected to become a significant source for financing, and infrastructure funds, credit rating and credit guarantee facilities are being established throughout the region to help secure loans from commercial lenders. Countries such as Vietnam and China, which lack a well-developed legal framework, are likely to face the biggest obstacles in securing financing from the private sector, delegates at the forum said.</p>

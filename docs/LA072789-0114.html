			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRIME COMPUTER'S PLAN TO EVADE HOSTILE BID HITS SNAG  </P> <P> Prime Computer's plan to escape a hostile tender offer ran into a potential  snag Wednesday when two banks asked Prime's white knight, J. H. Whitney &amp;  Co., to raise more financing for its $1.4-billion buyout of the Massachusetts  computer maker.  </P> <P> Prime also postponed its annual meeting for the third time, saying it wanted to  give shareholders more time to study a rival offer from MAI Basic Four, a  Tustin computer maker.  </P> <P> Whitney, a New York venture capital firm, emerged last month as a friendly  suitor for Prime, which has been resisting hostile bids by MAI for eight  months.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Prime's board said the Whitney offer is "economically superior"  to the most recent bid by MAI. That offer was to buy a part of Prime, its  minicomputer business, for $450 million in cash and $150 million in notes.  </P> <P> But Chemical Bank and First National Bank of Boston told Whitney on Tuesday  night that it will have to obtain additional financing because of Prime's  deteriorating financial condition, according to a Whitney statement.  </P> <P> Late Wednesday, Prime said it will report a loss of $19 million for its second  quarter ended July 3, contrasted with earnings of $7.2 million a year ago.  Prime said if it hadn't had $27 million in one-time expenses, most of which it  attributed to the cost of the takeover battle, it would have had operating  income of $10 million.  </P> <P> Whitney said it has been negotiating with "a major financial institution" to  obtain financing to meet the banks' new requirement. But it said "there can be  no assurances" that the additional financing can be obtained on terms  satisfactory to the banks or Whitney.  </P> <P> On the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, Prime stock fell $1.375 a share to  close at $15.75 while MAI was down 37.5 cents, closing at $5.375.  </P> <P> Prime said its decision to postpone its annual meeting until Aug. 9 was  unrelated to the financing difficulties facing Whitney. The decision to delay  the meeting was made after the Securities and Exchange Commission urged Prime  to give shareholders more time to study MAI's latest proposal, said Joe  Gavaghan, a company spokesman.  </P></p>

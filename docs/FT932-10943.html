			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / UK Company News: National Express makes purchase and disposal NATIONAL EXPRESS, the coach service operator which was floated on the Stock Exchange in December, is acquiring Scottish Citylink Coaches, the main subsidiary of Saltire Holdings, for Pounds 5.11m in shares, loan notes and cash. At the same time the group announced that it has agreed to sell Express Travel, its coach operating subsidiary, and Bruce's Coaches, a coach operating subsidiary acquired with Scottish Citylink, for Pounds 1.2m in cash to British Bus. The sale of Express Travel represents a further step in reducing NEL's involvement in the actual operation of coaches. Express Travel, which will continue to provide coaches under contract to NEL, made profits of Pounds 537,000 and had net tangible assets of Pounds 942,000 at the end of December. Scottish Citylink organises and markets 16 long distance scheduled coach services in Scotland, together with a number of commuter services including the Glasgow/Edinburgh link, and 10 cross-border routes between Scotland and London. It also offers services to Ireland and markets services between Scotland and mainland Europe. National said the acquisition would help it compete more effectively on cross-border routes with British Rail, significantly broaden its customer base and geographic spread and enhance profitability through the addition of Scottish Citylink's higher margin services within Scotland. Under the terms of the deal, Saltire's shareholders will receive 1.8m new National Express shares with the balance of Pounds 1.8m to be satisfied in loan notes, up to a maximum of Pounds 1.5m, and cash. National's shares closed 1p up at 187p yesterday.</p>

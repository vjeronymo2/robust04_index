			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Arabs suspicious of Rabin's approach: Israel's enemies have quickly lost their post-election optimism WHEN Mr Yitzhak Rabin won Israel's general election last month, Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman Yassir Arafat said exultantly: 'The Israeli public has voted against war and the terrorism of Shamir.' By last Saturday, however, Mr Arafat had changed his tune, saying he did not see Mr Rabin as different from Yitzhak Shamir, the former Prime Minister, Other statements by Arab leaders - notably from Syria - have sounded a similar note of scepticism over whether Mr Rabin, leader of the Labour party, will offer anything more of substance to the Arabs than did Mr Shamir and his hardline Likud party government, despite his offers to exchange peace missions and to accelerate the Middle East peace talks. But there is no doubt that Mr Rabin has a very different approach to peace making than Mr Shamir. It is almost certainly because they recognise the challenges this will present to them that Palestinian and other Arab leaders have begun to back off from their initial optimism about his election. Above all, Mr Rabin is a pragmatist who has never shared Mr Shamir's ideological commitment to perpetual Israeli control of Eretz Israel - the biblical land of Israel that includes the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. In his final speech as prime minister on Monday, Mr Shamir bitterly attacked Mr Rabin on this very issue. Although he avoided saying so during the election campaign, Mr Rabin also recognises that Israel cannot afford to defy the immense changes in the world of the past several years - notably the disappearance of the Soviet Union and its influence in the Arab world. 'It is our duty to see the world as it is now, to discern its dangers, explore its prospects and do everything possible so that the State of Israel will fit into this world whose face is changing. 'No longer are we necessarily 'a people that dwells alone', and no longer is it true that 'the whole world is against us',' Mr Rabin said in a pointed rejoinder to the siege mentality of Mr Shamir. Unlike Mr Shamir, Mr Rabin believes Israel must trade occupied land in exchange for peace and is ready to curb Jewish settlements there. He insists on keeping Jerusalem and other so-far unspecified areas he deems vital for Israel's security, which he will continue to settle. Labour party policy does not yet accept an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza. These are big problems for the Arabs. But the acceptance in principle of the 'land for peace' formula provides a far sounder basis for progress in negotiations than did Mr Shamir's adamant rejection of it. Under the terms of the Madrid peace talks, however, the final status of the occupied territories is not yet the subject of negotiation. First, there is to be a five-year interim period of Palestinian self-government as a transitional phase. Here, again, Mr Rabin is offering the Palestinians significantly more than Mr Shamir. He is proposing to base the interim arrangements on those outlined in the Camp David accords between Israel and Egypt of 1978; Mr Shamir said he was not willing to go as far as the Camp David proposals, offering instead only 'municipal autonomy' - in practice not much more than the right to collect rubbish. Mr Rabin is offering the Palestinians elections to a self-governing authority that will take over everyday administration in the West Bank and Gaza from the Israeli military and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from main population centres. Paradoxically, Mr Rabin's more forthcoming approach has unsettled the Arabs. Firstly, having benefited from the chill that afflicted US-Israeli relations under Mr Shamir, Arab leaders are now afraid of a revived US-Israel front that will put them under great pressure to make concessions. The US, after all, brokered Camp David. For their part, the Palestinians, who until last year rejected the Camp David formula outright, are already objecting to Mr Rabin's general outline (detailed proposals will not be made until peace talks resume in Rome, probably in early September). They oppose his intention to keep direct authority over the Jewish settlements, security, foreign relations and all frontiers. Palestinian negotiators are especially concerned about their ability to win popular support for an interim agreement which will inevitably limit the scope of Palestinian self-rule. While all Palestinians were agreed in rejecting Mr Shamir's offer, dangerous splits are already in evidence over how to deal with Mr Rabin.</p>

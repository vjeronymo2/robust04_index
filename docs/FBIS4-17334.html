			<p>BFN     [Text] The Federation Council's Speaker Vladimir Shumeyko  has spoken out against early presidential elections in Russia.    He wished that Boris Yeltsin would not only carry on as  president until 1996 but would nominate himself to next  presidential elections and be elected for yet another five-year  term.    Talking to the editors-in-chief of Russia's leading media,  Shumeyko said that Boris Yeltsin is the only appropriate  candidate to the presidency in the country.    "A change of Russian president now would be tantamount to a  catastrophe, he believes. A new head of state would start  changing the entire team in the center and province. His people  would start settling scores with previous teammates."    In such an event, Shumeyko feels, Russia would plunge into  such a political and economic crisis that would blast any hope  for further reform.</p>

			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Survey of Bulgaria (9): Business users come first / A look at progress in the telecommunications sector Bulgaria's responsibility for developing an electronics industry under the former Comecon division of labour helps explain why the country ranks first in telephone density among the former socialist countries, with 34 lines per 100 population. But expansion from only 14 lines per 100 in 1980 was achieved through obsolete analogue equipment whose design dated back almost half a century. Bulgaria has now started modernising its national and international telecommunications infrastructure with plans for a digital overlay network (Don). These plans include 1,700km of optic fibre lines, microwave links, a new international gateway, 11 long-distance exchanges, local exchanges and the earth satellite station system Intelsat. Almost 50 bidders tendered for the first six projects within the Don programme. Siemens of Germany was awarded contracts for a new international digital exchange as well as trunk and local digital exchanges in northern Bulgaria. Northern Telecom of Canada won a tender for an optical fibre line in western Bulgaria and Satellite Transmissions Systems (STS) of the US was awarded the contract for the construction of an Intelsat ground station. Sweden's Ericsson Telefon was commissioned for the construction of trunk and local digital exchanges in southern Bulgaria while a contract for the installation of an optical fibre trunk line in the eastern part of the country was awarded to Alcatel Cable of France. A tender is expected shortly for the last project - the building of a digital microwave trunk network. According to Antony Slavinski - the Bulgarian Telecommunications Company (BTC) vice-president of network planning and implementation who is in charge of the Don programme - much of the equipment from western suppliers has already arrived. By the end of this year work on some of the projects will be almost completed. When all elements of the network are completed, by 1996, it will service 150,000 subscribers, mainly business users in larger cities. Providing high-quality business services is a priority. Profits from business subscribers will help generate more funds for the subsequent modernisation of the residential network, which is expected to achieve European standards by the year 2008. About half of the Dollars 300m needed for the Don project has to be raised by BTC. The remainder is being provided by the European Investment Bank - Ecu70m (Dollars 86.80m) - the World Bank - Dollars 30m - and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development - Ecu32m (Dollars 39.68m). The loans have to be repaid in 15 to 20 years with grace periods of five to six years. Modernisation will involve higher prices and the telecommunications authorities have proposed regular increases in telephone charges. Since May 1993, charges have also been affected by the rapid Lev depreciation and have risen by 150 per cent. BTC says it is vital that tariffs reflect costs as BTC owes foreign telecommunications administrations Dollars 25m, but few Bulgarian customers realise that high-quality telecommunications is expensive and European standards can only be attained by heavy investment financed by higher prices. Legislative delays remain a drag on progress. A draft law has been ready for two years but 'by the time it is adopted by parliament, it will be outdated and will have to be amended', says Mr Slavinski. 'In order to carry on restructuring the sector, we use the golden rule that whatever is not forbidden by the law is allowed,' he adds. Meanwhile telecommunications sub-sectors such as mobile, radio wave and cable links are being deregulated as national and regional licences are awarded to domestic companies or consortia including both Bulgarian and foreign companies. Each sub-sector is expected to have two operators in future - one private, and one controlled by the state.</p>

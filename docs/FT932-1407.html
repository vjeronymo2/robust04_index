			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Russians set for takeover battle: History is in making at Vladimir tractor plant THE newly privatised Vladimir tractor plant is likely to go down in history today as the site of modern Russia's first corporate takeover battle. At the company's first general assembly, Mr Iosif Bakaleinnik, a Russian graduate of Harvard Business School, will ask shareholders to elect him as chief executive officer to replace its old-style manager. Mr Bakaleinnik is one of the first private investors to want to invest in Russian industry at a time when most Russian entrepreneurs and foreign companies are frightened off by the risks and difficulties involved. He is trying to increase his 8 per cent stake, saying he wants to overhaul the company with fresh capital and know-how so that it can withstand the new challenges of a market economy. But Mr Anatoly Grishin, who has run the plant for 18 years, claims that his rival, who was his deputy before he went to Harvard on a government scholarship, has neither the 'moral right nor the qualifications to run the company'. Fearing pressure from Mr Grishin on the workers, who own 51 per cent of the shares, Mr Bakaleinnik will be asking for a secret ballot. The government's chief aim in privatising 6,000 companies this year is to improve their performance by freeing them from the heavy hand of the state, exposing their management to market forces, and providing a vehicle for badly-needed new funds. So far, however, the main participants in the ambitious privatisation programme have been existing management and workers, investment funds, and citizens who have each received a voucher entitling them to Rbs10,000 worth of state property. Another exception to this rule is Mr Kakha Bendukidze, one of Russia's wealthiest men, who last week revealed that he had bought 18.5 per cent of Uralmash, a flagship of Soviet heavy industry. Unlike most of his peers, Mr Viktor Korovin, Uralmash's very able manager, has welcomed his new investors, saying that he looks forward to a 'mutually enriching relationship'. Mr Bendukidze, who made his fortune exporting oil products, chemicals and other semi-finished goods, has met resistance from directors of other plants in which he has bought shares. As a close associate, Mr Leonid Skoptsov, put it: 'Under socialism factories were the property of the directors and they don't want privatisation to change that.'</p>

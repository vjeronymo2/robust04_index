			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXPORTING MORALS TO EAST EUROPE  </P> <P> Komisar editorializes that the fall of communism in Eastern Europe will taint  the Western democracies with a new ersatz socialism as Eastern Europe rebuilds.  </P> <P> An irresponsible Komisar supports this new socialism and endorses higher taxes  to pay for it.  </P> <P> However, the Thatcher-Reagan economic revolution has demonstrated the value of  lower taxes in stimulating economic growth under capitalism.  </P> <P> Moreover, the people of the West have consistently voted against higher taxes,  even if this meant trimming social programs.  </P> <P> Komisar supports a nationalized health service paid for with more taxes. In  doing so she gives no credit to the American revolution in self-responsibility,  demonstrated through a reduction of smoking, drinking and high-fat diets.  </P> <P> She would openly encourage a government-run health service, that as Medi-Cal,  the Veterans Hospital system and Eastern European medicine have all frankly  demonstrated, would provide an inferior quality that Americans will not  tolerate.  </P> <P> The lessons of history are lost on this mistaken journalist, who fails to see  the blight that socialism has wrought on individual responsibility and  self-development.  </P> <P> CHRISTOPHER LYON, M.D.  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

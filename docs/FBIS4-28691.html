[applause]    The fifth congress of the KCU, a significant congress of KCU  members who are advancing toward a bright and hopeful future,  flying their proud red-color neckties, was a congress of glory,  a congress of loyalty, which showed the appearance of three  million KCU members who are growing up rapidly as the flower bud  of the revolution amid the bosom of the party and which  demonstrated to the world the firm will of the successors to the  chuche revolutionary cause to continue to the end the march road  of Paektu following the respected and beloved General Kim  Chong-il. [applause]    The great leader Generalissimo Kim Il-song, who identifies  children as the kings of the country, sent a congratulatory  message of love to the participants of the congress. The great  leader's congratulatory message is not only a brilliant sunlight  which brightens the future road of KCU members, who are always  preparing themselves for the consummation of the chuche  revolutionary cause under the party's leadership, but is also  the great program for the chuche-oriented children's movement.    Receiving the great leader's congratulatory message, KCU  members throughout the country are filled with infinite emotion  and joy.    The great leader Generalissimo Kim Il-song, who opened the  glorious beginning of the communist children's movement of our  country and formed the children's union and who has, thus,  identified our children as the kings of the country! The  respected and beloved General Kim Chong-il, who is fostering  strong our KCU members, the flower buds of the country, as  reliable successors to the chuche revolutionary cause, upholding  the generalissimo's lofty intent! Thanks to the guiding hands of  the great generalissimo and the respected and beloved general  the wide (?flower garden) of the 11-year compulsory education  system has opened, the palace of love has been erected high, and  the garden of happiness is efflorescing.    We are the proud KCU members who are growing up strong  without envy in the world amid the kind bosom of directing deep  attention to children and even picking stars in the sky for  children while saying the revolution and construction are  carried out only for the next generations.    We, the happy children who were born with the good fortune  of  upholding the leader [suryong] and with the good fortune of  being blessed with his love! We are proud of the fifth congress  of the KCU, a historic congress that fully demonstrated to the  world our mind of loyalty and filial piety toward our great  generalissimo and respected and beloved general. [applause]    The whole course of the congress seethed with KCU members'  invariable faith and zeal of loyalty to carry on the chuche  revolutionary cause and to consummate it to the end upholding  the respected and beloved General Kim Chong-il. Let us become  true young vanguards of the Workers Party who are infinitely  faithful to the respected and beloved General Kim Chong-il. This  was the basic spirit of the congress. It was also the solemn  echo noticing the glorious [word indistinct] of our communist  children's movement.    For our KCU members, who are continuing the chuche  revolutionary cause generation after generation, there is no  greater honor and pride than to become the party's young  vanguards who are infinitely loyal to the respected and beloved  General Kim Chong-il. [applause]    The fifth congress of the KCU sends this letter of appeal to  KCU members across the country, firmly believing that all KCU  members across the country will advance staunchly with one  breath and one step, upholding the great leader Generalissimo  Kim Il-song's congratulatory message and following the respected  and beloved General Kim Chong-il. [applause]    All the members of the KCU! Today, the members of our KCU  who walked a proud road by upholding the slogan "Let us always  be prepared for each stage of our revolution which is filled  with glory," have upheld the banner of loyalty to firmly prepare  themselves for their leader [yongdoja]. This is truly an  exciting event.    Let us highly manifest to the whole world the resolute will  and firm faith of the members of our KCU who are trying to  always be prepared for the respected and beloved General Kim  Chong-il. Members of the KCU, let us highly uphold the slogan,  "Let us always be prepared for the respected and beloved General  Kim Chong-il," and be true young vanguards of the Workers Party  endlessly loyal to the general.    The true young vanguards of the party, this is a truly  glorious title that makes all of our hearts beat. Becoming a  true young vanguard of the party is to become a young  revolutionary resolutely advocating and safeguarding the general  and fighting for the general by sacrificing his life with the  firm faith to follow only the respected and beloved General Kim  Chong-il from the time he is young.    The members of the KCU must be true young vanguards of the  party so that they can become reliable youth vanguards of the  party in the future and thus become a glorious member of the  Workers Party and grow up to be the party's true loyalists and  dutiful sons.    The basic character which the members of the young vanguards  of the party must possess is pure loyalty, having faith in, and  following only the respected and beloved General Kim Chong-il.    The great leader Generalissimo Kim Il-song has taught: The  members of the KCU must have a high pride of the fact that our  party is the best and that the bosom of our party is the best,  and always have faith in and follow our party, and study and  live as taught by the party.    From the time when they were young, the members of the KCU  must know only of their leader and their party, and must loyally  follow only the party and the leader.    On the road of loyally following the respected and beloved  General Kim Chong-il by highly upholding the great leader  Generalissimo Kim Il-song lies the true life of the members of  the KCU and a magnificent future.    All the members of the KCU, let us become loyal and dutiful  sons of having faith in and following only the respected and  beloved General Kim Chong-il. The respected and beloved General  Kim Chong-il is the fate of our people and the members of the  KCU. There can be no delight, laughter, and happiness of the  members of our KCU apart from the general's bosom.    The minds of the members of the KCU who have faith in and  who  are following the respected and beloved general must be  spotlessly clean. When the members of our KCU were born, the  first thing they saw was the benevolent pictures of the great  generalissimo and the respected and beloved general, and the  first words they learned was, "Thank you Generalissimo Kim  Il-song and thank you Mr. Kim Chong- il."    With the pure mind of that time, let us all become  sunflowers  of loyalty having faith in and following the respected and  beloved General Kim Chong-il. Just like the pine tree that does  not lose its appearance even if it is buried in snow, let us  foster the members of the KCU to have high loyalty who are able  to plow through thousand-ri of sea of fire and jumping over  myriads of mountains if it is for an eternally unchangeable  loyalty and for the great general.    Members of the KCU, let us all the more vigorously carry out  the movement of learning the glorious youth era of the great  leader Generalissimo Kim Il-song and the respected and beloved  General Kim Chong-il to regard the generalissimo's and the  general's lofty example as a basis and put it into practice  every step of the way. [applause]    Let us all take active part in the loyal exploration march  toward Chongil peak, the march to find the old home of the Mt.  Paektu secret camp, and the exploration march of Mt. Changja to  deeply bear in their minds the high intention of the respected  and beloved general who fostered the far-reaching plan to  elucidate Korea.    All the members of the KCU, let us firmly prepare ourselves  to become reliable successors of the chuche revolutionary cause  who possesses our party's revolutionary ideology and socialist  and communist ideology.    The members of the KCU who are the next shift of the  revolution are young revolutionaries. The members of the KCU  must be firmly armed with our party's revolutionary ideology and  socialist and communist ideology from the time when they are  young so that they can become a chuche-oriented revolutionary  and a true young vanguard of the party.    Members of the KCU: Let us firmly arm ourselves with our  party's revolutionary ideology and the chuche idea. The chuche  idea is a political nutrient for the members of the KCU and a  compass indicating the road ahead of the revolution.    Let us all deeply study the works of the great leader and  the  respected and beloved general, the [word indistinct] of the  chuche idea, to make the deep meaning filled in the works become  our bones and flesh, and let us always think and act only  according to the demand of the chuche idea anytime and anywhere.    The members of KCU must firmly succeed the existence of our  revolution so that it will be possible to complete to the end  the chuche revolutionary cause. The blood relationship linking  the revolution generation after generation is our party's  revolutionary tradition.    Members of the KCU; let us firmly arm ourselves with our  party's brilliant revolutionary tradition. Let us substantially  carry out various traditional revolutionary studies such as the  (?ideological) study of the participants of the anti-Japanese  revolutionary struggle and study of slogans to brilliantly  succeed the revolutionary spirit of the anti-Japanese  revolutionary patriotic forefathers who plowed through the march  road toward Mt. Paektu by highly upholding the great leader.    Let us all the more thoroughly embody the slogan, "Let us  carry out study and live in accordance with the anti-Japanese  KCU." The revolution which continues generation after  generation is advanced through struggle opposing all kinds of  class enemies. The dark intention of the class enemies does not  change.    Members of the KCU, let us correctly know the aggressive and  exploitative true nature of the class enemies including the U.S.  imperialists, the inveterate enemy, which brought about  innumerable unhappiness and sufferings to our people.    Let us always become a young revolutionary fighter endlessly  hating the class enemies and fight resolutely opposing the  rascals. The more happy we are let us all the more never forget  even for a minute our people past days who were exploited and  oppressed. Let us always be firmly prepared in our hearts to  maintain happiness through struggle by singing the songs of  happiness.    All the members of the KCU, let us become true young  patriots  devoting their bodies and minds to elucidate the chuche  socialist fatherland. Our socialist fatherland is the nest of  the life and happiness of the members of the KCU.    There can be no happiness today and a magnificent hope for  the future of the members of the KCU, apart from the bosom of  the socialist fatherland. The bosom of the socialist fatherland  is the bosom of the great general [widaehan changjunnim].  [applause]    Members of the KCU, let us treasure the socialist fatherland  more so than one's life with the one mind of loyalty of  upholding the great general and live enthusiastically. Having a  love for the country is fostered when we treasure even a single  blade of grass and tree of the fatherland, and when loving the  mountains and streams of their hometown, parents, and their  teacher.    Let us all firmly foster patriotism to become true young  patriots and young heroes unhesitatingly devoting their lives if  it is for the party, the fatherland, and the people.    All the members of the KCU, our fatherland endlessly  prospering under the wise leadership of the respected and  beloved General Kim Chong-il is waiting for a brilliant future.  The future is ours. Being possessed with knowledge, virtue, and  a healthy body is an important struggle goal of the members of  the KCU and a sacred task to bring about a brilliant future  ahead of schedule.    Let us all the more widely unfold the wings of knowledge,  virtue, and a healthy body for the respected and beloved general  and for the fatherland. Studying well is the first duty of the  members of the KCU. The members of the KCU must first and  second study well. Let us all highly uphold the slogan, "Let us  learn for Korea," and learn the glorious youth days of the  respected and beloved general to demonstrate the pride of being  a top honor student.    The respected and beloved general regarded the top honor  students as a jewel and pride, and loved them most and put them  in the forefront. Let us give happiness to the father and  general by obtaining excellent grades.    Let us become energetic and devoted scholars concentrating  on  studying during the days of the KCU so that they will be able to  become doctors, associate doctors, and famous inventors world  wide in the twenties and thirties.    The members of the KCU must read many books during the KCU  era which is filled with dreams. A book is a teacher without  words and a traveling companion of learning.    Let us vigorously carry out the reading trip toward Mt.  Changja study site to read more books and actively take part in  the school excursions, (?the blazing ideological activities),  and the (?2 June) camping to all the more consolidate  extensively and deeply the knowledge that we have learned.    Like the new generation living in a civilized era, let us  become members of the KCU who are developed in various fields  such as reading poems, singing songs, writing, doing magic, and  playing over one instrument.    Let us fully develop our makings and talents in the bosom  of the party which grows the valuable buds of the budding  flowers rapidly and become little doctors, little writers, and  little artists.    Let us the KCU members have the beautiful communist morality  and traits. The beautiful communist morality and traits of the  KCU members are the bright face of our fatherland. We should  foster the traits well in our KCU days so that we may become  righteous people who are faithful, good-mannered, and add luster  to man's dignity. The 10-point principles for the school  children to observe in their moral lives set forth by the  respected and beloved father General Kim Chong-il is the good  textbook of morality education which the KCU members should  always observe as they look in the mirror.    The members of the KCU: Let us abide by these 10-point  principles thoroughly and have the true traits with which we  think of the interests of the group first, love our comrades,  and devote all we have to the interests of the group.    The strong physical health of the KCU members is the  treasure  of the country. The KCU members should maintain strong physical  health so that the homes and society may be happy and gay with  laughter and smiles and filled with romantic optimism. The KCU  members should conduct various types of athletic activities  briskly to temper their bodies and foster strong fighting  spirit, bravery, and boldness. They should actively participate  in various sports activities to acquire at least one sport skill  and to actively contribute to the development of the country's  development of sport skills.    Loving to carry out the revolution and to work is the proud  ethos of the KCU members. It is truly a proud thing for them to  become the propagators of the party policy, helpers in the  implementation of the party policy, little builders of the  country, and little housekeepers of the country as KCU members.  Let us the KCU members continue to conduct the sociopolitical  activities vigorously and in high spirits with the sound of the  drums and bugles of the KCU, in order to keep the streets,  towns, and work places brisk and to give the people joy and  rapture.    Let us further develop our school-our guardpost campaign and  prepare ourselves firmly in our mind to become the honorable  sentries for the defense of the fatherland following the example  of the brothers and sisters of the People's Army. Let us do  more good deeds voluntarily for the country, the people, and the  Army of the respected and beloved general.    The KCU members: Let us participate ourselves in the core of  the KCU's organizational life and prepare ourselves firmly to be  the true juvenile honor guard unit and dependable inheritors of  the chuche revolutionary cause. The KCU's organizational life  is the school for revolutionary indoctrination for the KCU  members. In order for the KCU members to become good members of  the League of Socialist Working Youth of Korea [LSWYK] and to  become members of the glorious WPK in the future, they should  all carry on the KCU's organizational life well. KCU members:  Let us treasure and love the KCU organization, entrust  everything to the KCU organization, sincerely participate in the  KCU life, learn the KCU rules and regulations, and live  according to these rules and regulations at any time and place.    Through the life of the KCU, let us develop ourselves  vigorously to become the party's true housekeepers with  organization- mindedness, discipline-mindedness, diligence, and  simple mind, and faithfully abide by the pledge made before the  KCU flag. [crowd chants indistinct slogans]    In order to strengthen the KCU organization, we should make  the branch unions, the basic organizational units of the KCU,  function with vitality. All the branch unions should carry out  their roles well so that the school children's unions are  strengthened and the KCU is strengthened. The KCU activists,  including the chairmen of the branch unions: Let us uphold the  slogan of strengthening the branch unions and make all the  branch unions strong branch unions.    Let us become the example of the KCU members in all  areas--study, organizational life, and so on--and lead the  branch unions vigorously.    The revolution's enemies, including the U.S. imperialists,  are frenziedly maneuvering today to harm our-style socialism and  to deprive our KCU members of their happiness. However, we have  nothing to fear and we are brave because we uphold the respected  and beloved General Kim Chong-il, the ever-victorious  iron-willed brilliant commander, as the supreme commander.    The three million members of the KCU: Let us all become  three million bombs and six million hand grenades that defend  the respected and beloved general at the cost of our lives and  defend our beloved socialist fatherland, following the example  of our brothers and sisters of the LSWYK who are preparing  themselves to be five million bombs to cope with the situation  created. [applause]    All KCU members, let us all firmly renew our resolve,  determination, and faith with awareness of the sacred mission  for the times and the revolution as we embark on a new step  forward with the Fifth Conference of the KCU as a turning point.    As long as we have the great leader Generalissimo Kim  Il-song  and the respected and beloved General Kim Chong-il and as long  as we have the world's best socialist system, the future of us  the KCU members will always be filled with joy and happiness.  [applause]    Let us all advance forward vigorously, following the  respected and beloved General Kim Chong-il, to expedite the  chuche revolutionary cause initiated by the great leader.  [applause]    Long live the great leader Generalissimo Kim Il-song! Long  live the respected and beloved General Kim Chong-il!    The Fifth Conference of the KCU, 7 June 1994. [applause]</p>

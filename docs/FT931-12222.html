			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Pound devaluation adds 9% to import values THE SHARP jump in the visible trade deficit last month reflected the impact of sterling's devaluation on the value of imports. The Central Statistical Office said that last September's devaluation had so far added about 9 per cent to import values. In December import values rose 3 per cent compared with November to a record high of Pounds 10.9bn while export values were 0.5 per cent lower at Pounds 9.16bn. This left a visible trade deficit of Pounds 1.74bn, the largest monthly deficit since July 1990. It compared with a deficit of Pounds 1.41bn in November. Excluding oil and erratic items such as aircraft and precious stones, which tend to distort the trade figures, the visible trade deficit deteriorated by Pounds 222m on the month to stand at Pounds 1.85bn in December. The trend in export and import volumes was less gloomy. Although import volumes in December also reached a record high, and export volumes fell, the three-monthly comparison shows exports rising faster than imports. In the three months to the end of December export volumes rose 4 per cent against import volumes which rose only 0.5 per cent. Yet the year-on-year comparison continues to show imports outstripping exports. Import volumes rose 7.5 per cent compared with a year earlier while export volumes rose only 5.5 per cent. But with the lower pound yet to boost export volumes, there is reason for optimism about exports. 'The volume trends look reasonably favourable,' said Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Greenwell Montagu, the investment house. 'It is right to assume that the devaluation effect has yet to come through.' Economists also pointed out that, although high imports were bad news for the size of the trade deficit, rises among certain goods pointed towards economic recovery. The volume of imported consumer durables rose 4 per cent in the final quarter compared with the third, and were 21 per cent higher than a year before. Imports of intermediate goods - mainly manufacturers' components - rose 5.5 per cent on the quarter and were 15 per cent higher than a year before. Imports of capital goods were also robust. They rose 6 per cent on the quarter and 10 per cent on the year. The value of goods expor-ted to the European Community rose 8 per cent in the fourth quarter compared with the previous quarter and were 3 per cent higher than a year before.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      CURRENT ACCOUNT (Pounds bn)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     -----Visible Trade Balance------                            Less oil          Current             and                        Invisibles          Balance    Total erratics  Exports  Imports     Balance  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1991      -6.3     -10.3   -13.6     103.4    113.7       +4.0 1992     -11.8     -13.8   -16.4     106.8    120.5       +2.0 Qtr 1     -2.9      -3.0    -3.5      26.1     29.2       +0.2 Qtr 2     -3.1      -3.2    -3.8      26.7     29.9       +0.1 Qtr 3     -2.2      -3.2    -4.2      26.4     29.7       +1.1 Qtr 4     -3.7      -4.3    -4.9      27.5     31.8       +0.6 Jun       -0.9      -0.9    -1.2       8.8      9.7       +0.03 Jly       -0.8      -1.1    -1.3       8.8      9.9       +0.4 Aug       -0.8      -1.1    -1.6       8.9     10.0       +0.4 Sep       -0.6      -1.0    -1.2       8.8      9.7       +0.4 Oct       -1.0      -1.2    -1.4       9.1     10.3       +0.2 Nov       -1.2      -1.4    -1.6       9.2     10.6       +0.2 Dec       -1.5      -1.7    -1.9       9.2     10.9       +0.2  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Invisibles for October to December 1992 are projections.

			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / Travel: All creatures wild and murderous - Nature in the raw in the lovely Yorkshire dales A SOUND OF distress came from the other side of a dry stone wall. I peered over to catch a slice of nature red in tooth and claw as a stoat (or was it a pine marten?) took a screeching baby rabbit by the throat and dragged it off for lunch. This was my introduction to 'Herriot country,' and I am sure that if the good veterinarian had been there he would have been able to sort out my small-creature query. As he was not, I continued along the paths of the Yorkshire dales, admiring what must be some of England's most beautiful and varied scenery. If you do not get a kick out of walking and nature it is best to steer clear of James Herriot's back yard; on the other hand, you do not have to be a fan of All Creatures Great and Small, nor the plodding Emmerdale Farm, to enjoy the gaping limestone gorges, the pastoral riverside settings, the bleak, heathery moorlands and the patchwork of dry-stone walls that criss-cross from Wharfedale in the south to Swaledale in the north. I took up residence for a week in the small, workmanlike town of Masham on the eastern edge of the dales. It is not as pretty as the village of Arncliffe on the River Skirface, nor twee like the tourist centre of Grassington on the Wharfe, but it offers a Good Food Guide restaurant, the Theakston's brewery and all the supplies for a self-catering cottage. The let was an end-of-terrace house with one reasonable double and one tiny twin bed-room, a small lounge with open fire and a decent-sized kitchen. However, Pounds 250 for a week in May seemed high for the modest surroundings. One of the roads out of town to the west takes you across Marsham moor, a striking entry to the Dales proper and an important reminder of how quickly mists can descend and disorientate walkers. Be prepared, as well, for the 30-mile round trips from Marsham to your chosen dale and for narrow roads if you drive by more scenic routes. By far the best walk was in Swaledale and Gunnerside and was taken from Pennine Way South by Tony Hopkins. I did it late in the week so it did not mar the beautiful but less dramatic walks round the gentler areas of Upper Nidderdale, Kilnsey Moor and Moor End Fell on the River Wharfe. Swaledale was an important lead mining area until the end of the last century, and Gunnerside Beck, which runs into the Swale, is littered with the crumbling remains of a forgotten industry. You will find rusting, small-gauge rail trucks for carring ore, a delightfully arched building for milling and sorting, and numerous tunnels that brought the lead from deep in the sides of the valleys. Surprisingly, few of the tunnels are sealed, but only the foolhardy would dare to enter. Spoil heaps dominate the valleys in the mining areas, but instead of ruining the landscape they somehow enhance the severity of the moors and hillsides, giving a sharper contrast to the lushness of the riverside and woodland walks. From Gunnerside Gill there is a steep climb to a moorland scattered with grouse butts. A rocky descent, past the waterfalls of Swinner Gill and spectacular views of the gorge, takes you back to the Swale. The atmospheric ruins of the 12th century Fountains Abbey near Ripon, standing in the extensive grounds of Studley Royal Estate, are well worth a visit. In 1132, some of the monks of St Mary's Abbey in York felt that their Benedictine rules of piety were not severe enough. They were given land on the banks of the River Skell and set about building their remarkable abbey on a site 'fit rather to be the lair of beasts than human beings,' as Archbishop Thurstan of Ripon, who donated the land, described it.

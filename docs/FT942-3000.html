			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Shephard launches Pounds 10m scheme to help improve farm marketing Mrs Gillian Shephard, UK agriculture minister, yesterday launched a scheme worth Pounds 10m over the next three years to help farmers and small food companies improve their marketing skills. 'Primary producers are masterly at planning production, but their marketing skills are undeveloped, particularly when they are producing an undifferentiated product,' Mrs Shephard told an Adas food industry conference. The aid scheme will give grants of up to 50 per cent to help producers, processors and others in the industry 'sharpen up management and adopt better marketing practice', she said. The purpose of the scheme is to enable producers to forge closer links with the market place, an aim that has consistently eluded the majority of British farmers. Mrs Shephard said the grants could help with market research and feasibility studies as well as contributing to the salaries of important staff. The National Farmers' Union said it would conduct a feasibility study into ways of developing marketing opportunities for its farmers. It hoped to be able to give farmers advice on how to take advantage of the government's scheme. Mr Chris Haskins, chairman of Northern Foods, stressed the importance of working together with farmers when he said that the only way he could add value and increase his profits was through 'alliances with suppliers and consumers'. However, Mr Haskins and Mr Terry Leahy, marketing director for Tesco, the UK retailing group, conceded that it was much harder for farmers to work closely with food companies and retailers when they were producing commodity products that were in oversupply. Mr Leahy said that, nevertheless, better marketing would enable farmers to get more information from the market place on what type of products were wanted, how much and when.</p>

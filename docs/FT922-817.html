			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Loss warning wipes 22p off Henlys' shares Henlys Group, the motor trader, coach and bus manufacturer and distributor which has changed its name from Plaxton, yesterday warned that it would make a loss in the first half of 1992 and saw its shares slump 22p to 55p on the news. Mr Robert Wood, chief executive, said the problem area was the coach and bus manufacturing plant in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, where some of the 750 jobs would be cut in the autumn. Henlys had already cut coach production by closing three plants and concentrating production at Scarborough. Mr Wood said there were also teething problems with the group's new range of coaches. He said other parts of the group were showing improved results, but that City forecasts of a small profit for the year were too optimistic. Hoare Govett, the stockbroker, is now forecasting an annual loss of Pounds 2.5m. In 1991 the group made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 6.8m.</p>

			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Turkish paper buys into rival Turkey's Milliyet newspaper took a 35 per cent stake in one of its two main rivals, Hurriyet, yesterday in a move a Hurriyet executive said was designed to cut costs. Mr Yasar Eroglu said the sale of half of Hurriyet Holding's 70 per cent share in the daily to Milliyet did not herald a merger, but would allow the two high-spending papers to share costs. He did not say how much the Milliyet owner, Mr Aydin Dogan, had paid for the stake in Hurriyet. Hurriyet's net daily sales are around 508,000 and Milliyet sells about 360,000 copies. Both are locked in circulation wars with the biggest daily Sabah, which sells about 558,000.</p>

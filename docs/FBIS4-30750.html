			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 28 May -- Speaking today at the 3rd National  Congress of the National Trade Union Alliance [OPZZ], Prime  Minister Waldemar Pawlak described government activities as a  long- range strategy of Poland's development. He added that  Grzegorz Kolodko, the new deputy prime minister for economic  affairs and finance minister, was a guarantor of this policy.       The prime minister said that concrete facts constituted the  best information policy of his government, as opposed to paper  facts such as conferences or press statements, which were past  and gone very quickly.    In Pawlak's opinion, "protests are easier for the government  to pass over, while matter-of-fact and serious negotiations are  much more difficult." The prime minister stressed the role of  the Tripartite Commission (government-employers-employees) in  resolving disputes. He recalled that OPZZ deputies had  contributed to the setting up of the commission.    Replying to censure of the government's indecision on the  popiwek [excess wage tax], the prime minister admitted that his  cabinet had been divided on the issue. "The issue of the popiwek  has not been a matter of losing virginity, but a more complex  one," the prime minister said, arguing that the new bill was not  a "repetition of history."    In his speech, the prime minister also recalled decisions  made by the government, including the third revalorization of  old age and disability pensions this year, because -- as he put  it -- we are not giving in to the atmosphere created by the  media that we do not keep promises and have no program. The  prime minister added that if economic processes developed in  accordance with the government's expectations, there would be a  further improvement in the situation of pensioners and public  sector employees.    "I am glad that there will be no umbrella over our  government; we shall have to be careful not to jump from the  frying-pan into the fire," the prime minister said, commenting  on an earlier statement by Ewa Spychalska, who announced that  the OPZZ would not open a protective umbrella over this or any  other government.</p>

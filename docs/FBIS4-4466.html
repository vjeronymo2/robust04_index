			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta (JP) -- More than 500 students turned the  Jakarta District Court into a theater yesterday and staged a  tragedy in protest of the trials of 21 defendants charged under  the nation's defamation law.    They carried a mock-up corpse on a bamboo stretcher through  the corridors and burned incense, in what they said was  Indonesian democracy's funeral.    Security officers stood by watching but made no attempt to  interfere with the procession.    "Arrest us if you dare. Let's fill up the Salemba detention  center," one said.    The court yesterday proceeded with the trial of the 21  accused of defaming the name of President Suharto.    The students were arrested last December after staging a  demonstration at the House of Representatives (DPR) at which  they demanded the People's Consultative Assembly convene to  grill the head of state for his conduct.    Yesterday was the defendants' turn to present their defense  and none showed remorse for their behavior and used the  opportunity to lash out at the government for arresting them,  calling it an infringement on their freedoms.    The defendants remain divided into three groups, depending  on  the government's view of the severity of their alleged offense.  The prosecution's "hard core" group of defendants consists of  Yeni Rosa Damayanti, Masduki, Hendrik Dikson Sirait and Adi  Kurniawan. The other two groups consist of six and 11  defendants.    A lawyer of the group of four, Frans Hendra Winarta, told  presiding judge Sutrisno yesterday that the prosecution's  argument was obscure.    "It was not clear, precise or accurate as required by the  Procedural Code."    Frans blasted the prosecutors for using a law inherited from  the Dutch penal code, formerly used by the colonizers to charge  freedom fighters.    The article in question, that is a part of the current  Criminal Code, prohibits expressions of hostility, hatred and  disrespect towards the President.    "During the Dutch period, that horrible and scaring article  was heavily criticized by our forefathers," Frans said.    Yeni also read her own prepared, hand written defense  statement, entitled "Speaking the Truth is not a Crime."    She said the protest at the House had nothing to do with the  president. "We have no intention of mocking the president," the  29-year-old student militant noted.    The protesters main concern, she said, was the excessive  involvement of the military in day to day affairs, known locally  as the security approach to development.    The system has turned Indonesia into a "state of fear", she  said using a theme of a speech by Myanmarese [Burmese] Nobel  laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.    "I was accused of defaming an official, in fact it's I who  has to feel insulted," Yeni said, adding that a number of high  ranking government and military officials had called the  students "anti- Pancasila" [state philosophy].</p>

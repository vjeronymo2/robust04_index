			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Survey of Australia (9): Long list of projects - Mining A world-class performer suddenly forced to run harder just to stand still: that's an admittedly sports-oriented, but nonetheless apt description of the Australian mining industry as 1992 draws to a close. With slow growth in the world's locomotive economies keeping commodity prices under pressure, Australian miners have responded by doing what they've always done; simply produce more. The result: big rises in tonnage shipments of many key products including coal, iron ore, gold and base metals - but only a modest lift from ADollars 27.9bn to ADollars 28.1bn in mineral export receipts in 1991-92. Resource sector earnings have been a leading casualty, with less than 20 per cent of the country's leading mining companies managing earnings increases in the latest year, and many facing further cuts in the current year. Analysts have slashed their resource sector earnings projections, with BT Securities Australia typifying the share market mood. BT has cut a net ADollars 100m from its forecast earnings for a handful of the country's top miners over the next two years. Despite a belief that selected minerals - notably gold, zinc, copper and perhaps aluminium - have a slightly improved price outlook, most other analysts are similarly pessimistic on earnings. Yet Australian miners remain among the world's supreme optimists; committed to continued big capacity expansion even though the industry's increased output is already a leading contributor to world over-supply and price weakness in commodities. Leading stock broker Barclays de Zoette Wedd has identified more than 80 large Australian resource projects planned for commencement, mostly by the mid-1990s, and worth a conservative ADollars 33bn. This includes an estimated ADollars 14m worth of petroleum projects, with another ADollars 5bn in each of the coal and aluminium sectors, ADollars 1.8bn in zinc and ADollars 1.7bn in precious metals. Rapid expansion has been the trade mark of the Australian minerals industry almost since coal was discovered just 10 years after the arrival of the First Fleet in 1788. Australian Mining Industry Council figures show that the volume of the country's mine production doubled in the decade to 1992. The industry's share of GDP has grown from 7 to 9 per cent and its share of merchandise exports from 43 to 53 per cent in the same period. Given the long list of new projects, further minerals growth relative to the rest of the economy looks assured for at least the next decade. The Federal Government-controlled commodities forecasting group, ABARE, predicts an 8 per cent rise to ADollars 30.5m in the value of mineral exports in the current June year. It is a solid outlook in recessionary times, but the fate of mineral industry bottom line earnings will depend just as much on internal factors. Chief among these is the environmental debate which has already circumscribed some industry operations. Another big swing factor is the currency. With the Australian dollar looking weak against its US counterpart, mineral earnings may yet strengthen beyond expectations.</p>

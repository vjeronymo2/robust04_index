			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / UK Company News: European growth helps Filofax advance 68% Strong demand from continental Europe helped Filofax Group, the USM-quoted personal organiser concern, to report a 68 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.27m to Pounds 2.12m in the six months to September 30. Turnover rose 65 per cent to Pounds 13.7m (Pounds 8.3m). Excluding Henry Ling, the greetings cards business bought in July, and Drakes Office Systems, a manufacturer of carbonless message books, bought last December, sales grew by 29 per cent. Mr Robin Field, chief executive, said: 'The outlook for both organic growth and further acquisitions is exciting.' The group would continue to look for manufacturers of personal stationery products that could be sold through existing distribution channels. Sales in continental Europe rose 65 per cent. The group's four wholly owned continental subsidiaries showed increased sales of 50 per cent in the original organiser business, compared with a 20 per cent increase in the UK. Including the Drakes brand, UK sales increased by 60 per cent. Demand in the US and Japan was flat. In the US Filofax has reduced the number of outlets to concentrate on the top end of the market. Henry Ling contributed Pounds 2m in sales and Pounds 429,000 to operating profits of Pounds 2.18m in August and September. A large part of its revenue comes late in the year from Christmas cards. Sales in businesses other than the original organisers now make up 28 per cent of the total. Mr Field said that there was considerable scope for growth in countries such as France and Germany where sales per capita of Filofax Group products was 7p and 5p respectively, compared with 50p a head in Sweden and Norway. Earnings per share increased by 50 per cent from 4p to 6p and the interim dividend is raised by 40 per cent from 0.75p to 1.05p. The shares rose 4p to 233p.</p>

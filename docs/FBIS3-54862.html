Central Electoral Commission Chairman Ivan Yemets handed  representative of the above political parties the relevant  registration certificates.    A total of 17 political parties have so far been registered  by the Central Electoral Commission. None of them have  expressed any desire to form a bloc at national level.  Commenting on this phenomenon, the Central Electoral  Commission's secretary, Ihor Tseluyko, explains: "The point is  that it is disadvantegeous for parties to form a bloc at the  level of the Central Electoral Commission, since in accordance  with the law a bloc can only enter one candidate. It is only at  the regional level that blocs declared at party congresses are  likely to appear, which will at least enable them to bring  through a deputy from a friendly camp, if not one of their own."</p>

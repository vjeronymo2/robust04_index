			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Hoover pays lump sum over controversial deal WORKERS at Hoover's Cambuslang plant in Glasgow will receive one-off payments averaging about 20 per cent of annual wages for accepting the controversial deal on working practices that led to the closure of the US household appliance manufacturer's factory at Dijon, France. Every worker will receive Pounds 2,500 as compensation for the end of restrictive practices and demarcation lines, with a further Pounds 150 as a goodwill payment. Shift workers will receive Pounds 500 for accepting the reduction in the three-shift premium rate - the rate paid and calculated per shift - from 156 per cent to 133 per cent of the basic rate, the industry average. Hoover imposed a pay freeze last March and the present agreement will last until the end of this year. Basic weekly pay rates range between Pounds 169.80 for a labourer to Pounds 212.55 for a craftsman fitter. Leaders of the AEEU engineering and electricians' union yesterday robustly defended the deal. 'We have nothing to be ashamed of,' said Mr Jimmy Airlie, the union's executive officer for Scotland. 'We are not involved in social dumping. We will be apologising to nobody for what we have done. In the circumstances it was the best deal we could reach with the company.' The AEEU points out that many of the jobs lost when Hoover shut its Perivale plant in west London 10 years ago went to plants on the Continent. Tomorrow Mr John Weakley, an AEEU executive member not directly involved in the Cambuslang deal, will meet officials of the European Metalworkers Federation in Brussels, including a delegation from the CFDT and FO unions in France. The federation's executive requested the meeting to discuss the Cambuslang deal. Mr Weakley said yesterday he would not be discussing the details of the deal. 'I will sit down and listen to what they have to say.' Mr Bill Jordan, AEEU president who also heads the European federation, said: 'Our union will not discuss the content of the agreement - that is our business. It is not on the table.'

			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Syndicated Loans: Pemex launches further one-year Dollars 100m issue PETROLEOS Mexicanos (Pemex), the Mexican state-owned oil company, is launching a Dollars 100m loan facility and hopes to raise a total of up to Dollars 400m in the syndicated loans market in the immediate future, writes Sara Webb. Mexican borrowers have been absent from the syndicated loans market for several years. However, Pemex launched a one-year Dollars 100m syndicated loan through Chase Manhattan earlier this year and is now launching its second one-year Dollars 100m deal through ANZ. The deal is a syndicated revolving credit which may be funded either in the interbank market or by using the sterling Bankers Acceptance market and then swapping the proceeds into dollars, whichever proves cheapest. The maximum margin is 87.5 basis points over the London interbank offered rate (Libor), with a commitment fee of 12.5 basis points and management fees of 12.5 basis points for commitments of Dollars 10m, 10 basis points for Dollars 5m and above, and 5 basis points for Dollars 2m and above. Pemex plans to use the Dollars 100m facility to finance the import and export of oil and oil products. The Mexican oil group, which has borrowed occasionally in the international bond markets, is expected to raise a total of up to Dollars 400m in the syndicated loans market and may try to raise medium-term funds next by tapping the three-five year area of the market. Pemex is Mexico's largest company, with sales of Dollars 18.6bn last year. The government plans to divide the group into four semi-autonomous divisions in an attempt to improve productivity.</p>

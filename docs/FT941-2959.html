			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / British Coal to cut 320 more jobs British Coal is to cut at least 320 jobs at its Harworth, Nottinghamshire, colliery, in a move which signals significant further restructuring of the industry before privatisation later this year and in 1995. Although British Coal has completed the bulk of the rationalisation which started 18 months ago, it is thought that two or three more of the 17 pits now in operation will be closed in the next few months. Those believed to be most under threat are Bilsthorpe, in Nottinghamshire, Tower and Point of Ayr, in Wales, and Prince of Wales and Kiveton, in Yorkshire. Closures or rationalisations are likely to be signalled next month in meetings convened under the industry's colliery review procedure. Managers in the corporation's Midlands group told unions at Harworth that in future only 550 miners plus a 'minimal number' of contractors would be needed at the pit. There are 870 employees and 400 contractors. Mr John Longden, Midlands group director, said production this financial year had not reached the forecast of 2.3m tonnes and costs were high. The pit would be restructured over the next year, and after that annual output was expected to be about the same as it had been this year. Mr Longden stressed that Harworth remained 'an important part of our plans for the future. I am confident that the plan outlined today will secure the prospects for Harworth.' The pit had already broken its annual production record by this week passing the 2m-tonne mark for the first time, said Mr Longden. Under the restructuring plan the pit will work a single face rather than several at a time. The latest cut in jobs will leave fewer than 10,000 miners employed in the industry. In October 1992, more than 40,000 miners worked for British Coal at 50 pits. In addition to the 17 pits in operation, British Coal is planning to open the Asfordby pit in Leicestershire next year. Another, Maltby in the Yorkshire region, is being restructured and will merge with Silverwood next year. The closure of five other pits since the start of the year has removed annual production of about 8m tonnes. From next month, however, annual sales to the two large electricity generators, PowerGen and National Power, will fall by 10m tonnes. With stockpiles of coal well above what British Coal and the generators consider their commercial or strategic requirements, further rationalisation is inevitable. Meanwhile, Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, has told the House of Commons that the UK imported a total of 18.4m tonnes - worth Pounds 687m - last year, according to provisional government figures. The US was the biggest supplier, with 4.3m tonnes. Australia supplied 4.1m tonnes, Colombia 2.5m tonnes, Poland 1.7m tonnes, South Africa 781,000 tonnes, Russia 713,000 tonnes and Canada 632,000 tonnes.</p>

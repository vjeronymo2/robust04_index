			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Aid signalled for private landlords THE GOVERNMENT may have to provide further assistance to encourage private landlords to increase their presence in the housing market, the prime minister said yesterday. Speaking at the Harry Simpson Memorial lecture in London, Mr Major said: 'There is clearly a need for a larger private-rented sector in Britain. We have released some of the old shackles on landlords. But we may need to go further if the sector is to show any significant growth.' Ministers have been contemplating incentives to revive the private-rented sector but this is the first time, according to officials, that the prime minister has signalled the possibility of providing further assistance to landlords. Sir George Young, the housing minister, in particular is thought to be keen to reinvigorate private renting which at the turn of the century provided about 90 per cent of housing compared with less than 7.5 per cent by 1990. He yesterday welcomed the prime minister's comments, which he said underlined the government's commitment to private renting. The Treasury is also thought to be receptive to moves to encourage private renting which could improve the supply of housing without restarting an inflationary rise in house prices. Private renting previously has been encouraged by the 1988 Housing Act which restricted tenants' rights and gave landlords greater freedom to set rents. An extension of the Business Expansion Scheme also provided tax breaks for investors in housing for rent. The scheme finishes at the end of this year. Mr Major said, however, that the great majority of people still wanted to own their own home. He was pleased by recent signs that stability was returning to the housing market but he did not want to see a return to a 'frenetic market with prices rising dramatically'. This would be inappropriate for the housing market and the economy, he added.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Kholodov: "Pavel Grachev's `Pavlovian' </F> Reform: Russian Army Won't Be Driving Mercedes Any Time Soon"]    [Text] Seventy percent of all officers and warrant  officers think their units are incapable of performing their  missions. Up to 40,000 young officers leave the army each year.  Understaffing of officers (especially young officers) has  reached a critical point: .2 percent is the margin separating  the army from a loss of combat readiness. Manning levels for  enlisted men and sergeants are at just 54 percent. Army losses  outside of combat zones stood at nearly 2,500 men in 1993, which  is nearly 500 lives more than in 1992.    The Defense Ministry could lose control of the Russian Army  in the near future. If this happens, General Grachev will be  issuing orders only within the bounds of the "Arbat Military  District"--the complex of General Staff buildings on the Arbat.    The situation is beyond belief. Boris Yeltsin, continuing  the  tradition of talking about the most important issues far away  from official podiums, unveiled upcoming plans for army reform  at a meeting with Suvorov School cadets. "The task of  invigorating military reform has been posed. It is now possible  to act more decisively and more consistently," said the  president. The Russian Army will use a new principle to defend  us--a mobile defense reminiscent of the American "flexible  response strategy." Instead of unbroken defense along our  borders, for which there is no longer enough manpower or money,  we will have compact mobile groups trained to fight local wars.  They will be the first line in the event of a "big" war.    However, Russia is embarking on a very complex reform with a  Defense Ministry that has already demonstrated its utter  inability to carry out reforms. In the two years since the  creation of the Russian Defense Ministry, faith in democratic  reforms in the army has been totally undermined. And the  ministry leadership has managed to turn against itself not only  officers, but also its own people. Hazing has become so bad in  units, on ships, and even at schools that desertion has reached  massive proportions. Youths avoid military commissariats like  the plague. This was discussed at a recent conference entitled  "Army and Society" in Moscow. After its harsh army conscription  of students at vocational-technical schools, technicums, and  commercial higher schools in the fall of 1993, the Defense  Ministry, according to some reports, is already thinking about  abolishing student conscription because the educational  institutions failed to produce significant numbers of recruits.    Ideological control over the Armed Forces has now been lost.  On February 23, as they observed the anniversary of the Red  Army's creation, probably very few officers recalled that on May  7, by order of the first Russian president, the Russian Army was  formed. After abolishing political agencies by Order No. 15 of  January 12, 1994, the military leadership set no new ideological  priorities, without which, unfortunately, our army cannot yet  function. The Defense Ministry didn't even try to revive the  traditions of the Russian officer corps. The resulting vacuum  has willingly been filled by "patriots"--the newspaper ZAVTRA,  with the disclosures of an anonymous general on the events of  October, was read in some units until it had holes in it. Two  years too late, Pavel Grachev remembered the Orthodox Church, on  which the Russian Army was based before the revolution. It will  probably be another two years before concrete decisions are  formulated and chaplains appear in the units.    The armed forces leadership has also failed to protect the  army from corruption.    The following is from a letter from armed forces and war  veterans (!) to President Yeltsin:    At a time when the state has no way to promptly pay its  soldiers, more than 20 billion rubles in public funds  appropriated to the military insurance company (Reserve Colonel  S. A. Tsikolyuk, president) to be used to provide servicemen  with life and disability insurance, by order of Grachev and  Vorobyev, were channeled to commercial structures through the  Menatep Bank at an interest rate of 240 percent. No one knows  who is distributing that interest and for what army needs.    Of the proceeds from sale of property belonging to the  Western Group of Forces, less than 15 percent has been allocated  to finance construction, purchase housing, and solve other  social problems facing servicemen. On the other hand, millions  of marks were used to buy an enormous quantity of calcium  carbide, which is apparently no longer available in Russia, and  various materials. Money was also found to buy a Mercedes Benz  that our forces urgently need.    After the breakup of the USSR, we ended up with  third-echelon  forces. And the most combat-ready units were left behind in the  ex-Soviet republics. Great hopes were pinned on the divisions  being withdrawn from Germany, but they became drawn into  commerce and are returning to Russia utterly incapable of  combat. Things have reached the point where Polish racketeers  working the highways have established special duties for Russian  military transit drivers taking cars to Russia: A Russian  warrant officer pays 200 marks, an officer 400.    It is said that when Soviet troop commanders moved from  Hungary to Germany, the generals' plane was preceded by heavily  loaded cargo planes carrying their personal property. "They took  only the most essential items with them," the pilots joked. Does  a person need a lot? As it turns out, yes. The cargo planes of  the Western Group of Forces were so heavily loaded that the  first deputy commander of the 16th Air Army was arrested and  jailed. Colonel-General Burlakov, the commander in chief of the  Western Group of Forces himself, was involved in one case.  Inspections were of little help. What commission can withstand  the temptation of German marks, let alone German women! It is  said that one general who headed a rear-services commission that  was inspecting the Western Group came back with syphilis--a  young woman's "gift" for him.    There is nothing surprising about the fact that the Western  Group of Forces has become drawn into commercial  activities--only command and staff exercises have been held  there for some time, and the soldiers march on paper only. What  is surprising is this: Just one or two cases of corruption have  been made public. Yet such cases are legion. Is it any accident  that Western Group of Forces Military Procurator Yuriy Yerin was  recently promoted to general?    Reformers have been disliked throughout history. But Pavel  Grachev's unpopularity is of a quite different nature. The  minister has recently been accused of selecting personnel on the  basis of personal loyalty, something that has repeatedly spelled  the ruin of bureaucrats of various ranks. Moreover, military  personnel are extremely vulnerable to protectionism: Officers  are limited in their ability to earn money, and a military  career is the only thing the state can use to entice them to  serve.    Grachev's unpopularity with the troops has reached the point  where instead of the honorable title "grandfather," which is  bestowed on especially respected commanders, General of the Army  Grachev is called by his first name, together with the word  "Mercedes," for the car he travels in. A Russian defense  minister can't ride in some Soviet Volga or Zhiguli!    The whole army is discussing Pavel Grachev's recent dispatch  of his son to the Western Group of Forces, contrary to his own  order stating that only servicemen with previous service in  "hotspots" may be sent to lucrative Germany. Senior Lieutenant  Grachev flew to the Western Group of Forces just a few months  before the withdrawal of our last forces from Europe. When he  returns, an apartment in one of the comfortable compounds the  Germans built for the Russian troops being withdrawn might await  him.    Such mistakes by the defense minister discredit the very  idea  of reform. The situation in the army is reminiscent of  1990-1991, when the unpopular premiers Pavlov and Ryzhkov  attempted to reform the economy.    The Russian Army is no longer combat-ready today. There is  just ONE Russian missile-armed submarine on alert duty in the  ocean. (The Americans have 10 or 11 submarines.) Meanwhile,  according to participants in the "Army and Society" conference,  all reform has been reduced to the "signing of standard  contracts, new uniforms, and higher pay."    A frightening process has begun in the army. District  commanders no longer rely on their ministry and turn to local  authorities directly for help. In this way, the army is becoming  tied to regions, something that, in the event of a crisis, could  break it up into component parts.    The Defense Ministry is making desperate attempts to enhance  its prestige. General Kondratyev, the deputy minister, suddenly  becomes a diplomat and goes to Nagornyy Karabakh to extinguish  the conflict. Within a few days his much-publicized mission  collapses, and now Kondratyev is giving interviews in the  Dniestr region. Pavel Grachev is also making his diplomatic  debut, but he prefers foreign countries.    In recent days the government has launched an outright war  on  defense appropriations. The Defense Ministry is asking for  almost 60 percent of the entire state budget (almost 80 trillion  rubles), saying the army could collapse. The ministry is indeed  in a trap--the army has to be cut, since there is not enough  money, but cuts are impossible because no money is available for  the legally mandated payments and compensation either.    The situation is further compounded by the fact that in this  transitional period, the old military administrative division of  Russia into military district has been left intact. This  essentially requires that the defense budget be doubled. But the  taxpayers are poor, and so reform will most likely be of a  shock-therapy character. The Russian Army, it seems, will have  to cross the Alps yet again. But this time without Suvorov.</p>

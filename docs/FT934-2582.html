			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Survey of Oil and Gas Industry (3): The pressure rises - Natural Gas Natural gas is undergoing a metamorphosis. Within just a few years it has shed its status as a nuisance by-product of oil and has donned the mantle of being the 'noble' fuel. Shares in oil companies rich in gas reserves have enjoyed stock market premiums in the past year. Gas distributors in industrialised countries are increasingly moving into international markets. Deregulation of the industry in the US has boosted prices and set off a mini-exploration boom in the Gulf of Mexico. Growing markets in the UK have resulted in mature North Sea oil fields, such as Brent, being re-engineered as gas producers. Further afield there has been a proliferation of proposals to build new pipelines to link remote reserves found in Russia, other former Soviet states and the Middle East with markets in Europe and Asia. The rising interest in gas across the world begs the question, however, of whether companies can actually develop a global strategy for gas along the lines of the international oil business. For unlike oil, the gas business varies widely by region. In addition it is not an internationally tradeable commodity in the sense of oil, which can be easily transported to a variety of markets in relatively small amounts. The high costs of gas require a direct physical and contractual link between the production site and consuming area. But there is no shortage of companies, mainly from the US and Europe, chasing the growing list of opportunities. They form three main groups: The development of specific gas fields for use in power generation schemes. The number of such projects has grown steadily, with many companies focusing on Asia, where gas consumption has risen by 126 per cent in the past 10 years and where electricity shortages have emerged because of rapid economic growth. The linking of large remote reserves to the main industrialised consuming countries, especially in Europe and Asia through long, high-capacity pipelines or by deliveries of liquefied natural gas (LNG). The high cost of such projects usually results in the formation of a consortium to spread the risks. A good-sized LNG scheme can cost Dollars 5bn to develop. Pipeline projects can cost even more - the Troll project linking North Sea gas fields off Norway with six European consuming countries will cost Dollars 11bn. The refurbishment of ageing domestic gas supply systems, a number of which are being privatised. British Gas, the biggest Western integrated gas company, has decided that its best growth prospects lie in applying its experience in both upstream and downstream areas to less regulated international markets. The company recently sold its Consumers Gas subsidiary in Toronto, the largest single element of its international holdings grouped under Global Gas, the international transportation and distribution division. The sale did not reflect a scaling back of British Gas' international ambitions, according to Mr Russell Herbert, head of Global Gas. It merely reflected a change in strategy to concentrate on less mature markets. A model for future projects, says Mr Herbert, is British Gas's current refurbishment of the privatised Buenos Aires and Berlin gas supply systems. Asia looms large in British Gas's expansion plans, with a variety of exploration and production projects and power generation schemes in Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and Pakistan. Its largest single project is the Karachaganak field in Kazahkstan, which could cost British Gas and Agip, the Italian oil company, as much as Dollars 6bn to develop. A number of other companies known mainly for oil production are significant forces in global gas markets. Shell, for example, has large gas businesses in the US, Europe and Asia. Its concentration has been on exploration and production rather than distribution, a trend which is likely to continue. Natural gas forms 68 per cent of the proven reserves of Total, the French company, which is particularly strong in Asia and Europe. US companies such as Mobil, Exxon and Amoco are also keen to build on their strong gas reserves. A number of national gas supply companies, such as Gaz de France, are seeking to profit internationally from their domestic expertise. The perceived need to be able to compete internationally was one one of the main factors behind the deal earlier this year in which Gas Natural, Spain's national domestic gas distributor 45 per cent owned by Repsol, the state controlled energy group, bought Enegas, the monopoly industrial gas supplier, which is fully owned by the state.</p>

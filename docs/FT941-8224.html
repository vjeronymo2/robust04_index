			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Pulling the global pearls together - Cable and Wireless' investment strategy The FT comment last June that Cable and Wireless, the UK telecommunications group, has 'pearls scattered around the world but lacks a thread to pull them together,' reflected the thinking of some of the company's senior executives. Mr James Ross - the urbane and determined former chairman of BP America brought in as chief executive two years ago by C&amp;W's chairman, Lord Young - insists the company has now discovered the string to tie together a host of activities from Mercury in the UK to Optus in Australia, the challenger to the former Antipodean state telecoms monopoly. 'We are not just a holding company for a diverse range of telecoms activities: we make sense as a federation, and intend to strengthen the bonds between the different parts,' said Mr Ross. C&amp;W, he argues, is currently undervalued because it does not attract the premium it deserves as a sum of more than its parts. The essential bond the company has now discovered is a 'coherent investment strategy' giving pride of place to growth in the Asia-Pacific region. This is the home of Hong Hong Telecom, C&amp;W's richest pearl, which accounted last year for Pounds 554m of its Pounds 829m operating profit. Mr Ross spells out what this priority means: a commitment 'over the medium term' to devote Hong Kong Telecom's free cash flow to investments in the Asia-Pacific. 'Outside Hong Kong we have underinvested in the area and we are now intent on growing other Asian opportunities.' Mr Ross highlighted opportunities to build and operate networks in under-developed Asian markets. China is the 'great object' but, with telecoms racing ahead in all parts of the region, 'not the sole magnet.' 'Other companies' - for which read BT and AT&amp;T in their ambitions to be global providers to the multinationals - 'don't really go in for those (construction projects). We are playing a different competitive game, which is not the big multinationals.' He is also explicit about C&amp;W's European strategy, which is two-pronged. In the larger markets, like Germany and France, C&amp;W will be the 'Mercury in Europe', building networks to challenge the monopolies of state operators as liberalisation advances. In the smaller markets, such as Ireland and Portugal, it is looking for opportunities to partner existing monopoly operators. 'We don't believe there is enough room for a national competitor, and the existing operators need an international player like us.' What will unite the federation? People, products and a global network capacity, said Mr Ross. He pointed to the swapping of senior managers, like the recent exchange between the deputy chief executives of Mercury and Hong Kong Telecom; and he emphasised the convergence, in terms of services and marketing, of world telecoms markets. 'Take Hong Kong: we have got competition there next year, and intend to make full use of our experience as the under-dog in Britain in facing it.' Mr Ross's strategy faces an immediate objection. As a company less than a third the size of BT, how is C&amp;W going to fund serious expansion from three hubs worldwide - the third being the Caribbean region? More-over, to make itself attractive to the Chinese, C&amp;W arguably needs an image more regional than global. Mr Ross implicitly accepted both points by playing down the investment outlays to be expected outside Asia-Pacific, and stressing the trend towards indigenous management, as reflected in the recent appointment of Mr Linus Cheung, deputy managing director of Cathay Pacific Airways, as chief executive of Hong Kong Telecom. 'Partnership is the key', said Mr Ross. 'We can't even try to operate on our own in many places, but we have experience and networks that can bring a lot to any partnership, whether in China or Germany.' As for resources, he cited C&amp;W's low gearing (about 13 per cent), suggesting an increase in spending from the current Pounds 1bn a year to Pounds 1.5bn to be 'a responsible objective'. The strategy has clear attractions. Partnership between indigenous and overseas operators is the industry trend, from cellular mobile services in Europe and the US to basic line-building ventures in Asia. For governments and indigenous telecoms operators, C&amp;W has a top-notch name without being one of the large, perhaps more threatening, US or European forces. The capacity to learn in one market to profit in another will give a critical edge as competition advances. To benefit, it may not be size so much as presence that matters, and C&amp;W's presence is more widely spread than most. But if Hong Telecom's free cash flow is to go into Asia, a question mark must be raised over the European strand to C&amp;W's thread, particularly if Mercury's profits are depressed by the explosion of competition in the UK. As Mr Ross puts it: 'we don't have a home market: we only came back to the UK in the last 10 years.'</p>

The military command issued a statement on Tuesday [29  March]  retaliating a recent amendment to the Dniester laws which  declared all Army weapons, equipment and other hardware  belonging to Tiraspol.    "Tiraspol actually provokes seizure of the 14th Army's  weapons and equipment," the statement said and qualified the  actions of Dniester leaders as "demonstrating extreme disrespect  towards the Russian Federation and its peace-keeping efforts in  the region."    The Army command demanded the annulment of the "provocative"  amendment.</p>

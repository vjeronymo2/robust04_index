The Nicaraguan diplomat said his country is willing to  cooperate with Honduras in investigating to what extent the  statements in the U.S. report are true. He said: "There is  cooperation between the governments and a common goal,  therefore, this will be resolved between the two governments."    He also said the Honduran Government could make inquiries in  Nicaragua to clear up the contras' participation in human rights  violations but "those inquiries must be conducted by mail, with  help on a judicial and diplomatic level."    Explaining the Juan Pablo Cruz Laguna [not further  identified] murder case, Rivas said the Nicaraguan Government  "does not expect anything more;" however, a sentence must be  handed down since right now "a trial is under way." Rivas said:  "This has to end with a sentence; it must be clear who is  guilty."</p>

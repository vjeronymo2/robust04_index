			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Yukio Sato, Foreign Ministry North American </F> Affairs Bureau director general: "Toward 1995 -- a Critical Year  in Asian and Pacific Security"]    [Text] The issue of security in the Asia Pacific region  has been relatively easy to handle until recently. The central  issue has been how to develop a dialogue on security for the  entire region.    Initially, Japan and the ASEAN countries agreed on the idea  of utilizing the expanded ASEAN foreign ministers' conference,  and other countries also agreed.    But from now on, the substance of what is to be achieved  through dialogue will become the issue. It is anticipated that  reconciling the opinions of the concerned countries will not be  easy, including the treatment of concrete issues such as North  Korea's (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) nuclear arms  development. It is especially difficult because international  politics in the Asia Pacific region is thought to be entering an  era of full-fledged multinational consultation.    Under such circumstances, what kind of role should Japan  play  to secure peace in the Asia Pacific region and to promote  economic development of countries in the region? That is the  question we must now consider.    Over the last four years, I have been given the opportunity  to think over security for the Asia Pacific region from a  variety of angles. I want to remind readers in advance that  what I am going to write in this article is my private opinion,  based upon that experience.  Japanese Response Has Changed -- From Opposing Soviet Proposals  to Forming a  <H5>  Consensus in the Region </H5>   It was the Soviet Union which first took up the subject of  security in the Asia Pacific region. The Soviet Union had  proposed since the 1960's a series of Asian collective security  concepts. Typical examples included, among others,  Secretary-General Brezhnev's Asian Collective Security Plan and  President Gorbachev's All Asia Collective Security Conference  Plan. Each concept sought to create an organization similar to  the CSCE (Conference on Security Cooperation of Europe) in the  Asia Pacific region. It is easy to conceive that the aim was to  interrupt the network of the Western alliance led by the United  States, also keeping in mind the Soviet-Chinese confrontation.    On the other hand, various proposals have been made from the  Western camp in recent years, namely The Northern Pacific  Security Concept by Canadian Foreign Minister Clark, and the  CSCA (Conference of Security Cooperation in Asia) by Evance,  Australian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade. In the ASEAN  countries, movements to hold international conferences on  security issues have been emerging.    Given such currents, Japanese responses have changed. The  turning point was President Gorbachev's visit to Japan in April  1991. Up until then, the emphasis of the Japanese response had  been placed on denying the validity of the Soviet's proposals;  to that end the Japanese Government had been stressing how  different the Asia Pacific region was from Europe.    The foreign policy speech Foreign Minister Nakayama made at  the Diet three months prior (January 1991) to Gorbachev's visit  to Japan summed up the government position at that time. That  speech highlighted a number of basic points which needed to be  recognized regarding security in the Asia Pacific region.  Though it is a bit long, I want to quote a relevant portion [of  the speech] as the premise for the argument I am going to make.    "I think that the time has now come to seriously examine the  path to securing long term stability for the Asia Pacific  region. It is natural that in this region the process for  achieving that purpose is different from that in Europe. That  is because the geo-political conditions and the environment for  security in this region are significantly different from those  of Europe.    "First, due also to the fact that many of the countries in  the Asia Pacific region are developing countries, the greatest  concern of each country is economic development. This is very  different from Europe which so far has considered military  detente and the threat of nuclear war to be the matters of  greatest concern.    "Second, in Europe in the past, the East-West relationship  existed in the polarized form of NATO and the Warsaw Pact. In  contrast, in the Asia Pacific region, there are many elements  which can not be subsumed under the East-West relationship,  including the existence of China. International politics takes  the form of multipolar power relations. Alliance relations in  this area are mostly bilateral, and the conflicting interests  and concomitant recognition of accompanying threat varies  between individual countries. Consequently, the overall  security situation is complex.    "Third, in contrast to the fact that in Europe the so-called  CSCE process was initiated in an effort to resolve post-war  boundary issues and so forth, in the Asia Pacific region,  unsolved disputes and confrontations such as the North South  confrontation on the Korean peninsula, Cambodia issue, and  Northern Territories issue between Japan and the USSR are still  present.    "And fourth, in Europe, there is a major movement toward  unification, politically and economically, with the movement of  the EC union at its center. But in the Asia Pacific region,  relationships of economic mutual dependency are pursued on the  basis of national, regional, political, social, and cultural  diversity and differing phases of economic development.    To recognize such characteristics of the Asia-Pacific  region and insure its peace and security, it is important to  seek solutions for unsolved disputes and confrontations -- such  as the confrontation on the Korean peninsula, the Cambodian  issue, the Northern Territories issue, and so forth -- and  through this process, to promote dialogue in order to bring  about lasting stability in each subregion -- such as Northeast  and Southeast Asia -- and to strengthen cooperative  relationships.    As for regional cooperation in a broader sphere, in light of  the fact that economic development is important for the  stability of the countries in this area, it is important to  promote cooperation stressing the economic sphere. In concrete  terms, utilizing already existing frameworks -- such as ASEAN,  the ASEAN Expanded Foreign Ministers' Conference, the  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) ministers' conference,  the Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference (PECC), and so on --  is the most suitable way for this region to expand dialogue and  cooperation on various issues in the political and economic area.    President Gorbachev did not mention the usual Soviet  proposals when he visited Japan. As a consequence, the  Soviet-Japan dispute on security in the Asia-Pacific region  ended for a time. Also, by then Australia and Canada had  stopped talking about the "approach" which took the CSCE as a  model.    But the issue did not end then. Among the countries  involved, it has become important to create a consensus for an  "approach" suitable to this region's actual circumstances.  Recognizing this, Foreign Minister Nakayama made the following  proposal, indicating Japanese thinking on Asian-Pacific regional  security, at the ASEAN Expanded Foreign Ministers Conference (at  Kuala Lumpur) held in July 1991, three months after the  Gorbachev visit:    "What is necessary for the Asia-Pacific region is to  comprehensively and in a multi-tiered manner utilize the various  existing international cooperation arrangements which currently  exist as well as the places of discussion, and to secure the  long term security of this region.... If something is to be  added to the already existing cooperation arrangements and  frameworks as regards the areas of economic cooperation, foreign  policy, and security, it should be a forum for political  dialogue where friendly countries of this region can conduct  frank exchanges of opinion on matters of mutual common  interest....    "The dialogue which the friendly countries would conduct in  order to increase mutual feelings of security would also  strengthen the political basis of mutually cooperative  relationships. Such a political dialogue would be different in  nature from confidence building measures intended to relax  military tensions.    "Because of this recognition, it is significant and timely  to  utilize the ASEAN Expanded Foreign Ministers' Conference as a  forum for political dialogue intended to increase feelings of  mutual security. In order to make such political dialogue more  effective, it may be useful to establish a site for a senior  operational-level conference within the larger ASEAN, and to  have the participants report the results of their discussion  back to the larger ASEAN conference."    At that time, it was reported that U.S. Secretary of State  Baker ignored this proposal, the ASEAN countries resisted it  because they did not receive prior consultation, and in Japan  not much attention was paid to the proposal. But the concept  which the ASEAN Expanded Foreign Ministers' Conference adopted  two years later -- in July 1993 -- at Singapore mirrored exactly  the Nakayama proposal made at the Kuala Lumpur Conference. The  contents of the concept were: 1) in order to discuss security  for the entire region -- including China, Russia, Vietnam, and  others -- a cabinet level ASEAN Regional Forum was to be  established; and 2) prior to the cabinet members conference, a  senior operational level conference (SOC) was to be held.    As for ASEAN countries not receiving prior consultation,  there was some basis for that interpretation. But this proposal  did not come out of blue for the ASEAN countries. About one  month before the Kuala Lumpur Conference, I proposed to ASEAN  officials in charge of the issue the idea of utilizing the ASEAN  Expanded Foreign Ministers' Conference as a forum for political  and security dialogue as well as for submitted papers. This  conference was held following a decision of the ASEAN Foreign  Ministers' Conference. As for my attendance, I had been invited  by the Philippines Government, albeit in a private capacity, as  the official in charge of the issue for the Japanese Government  (as director general for the Information, Analysis, Research,  and Planning Bureau).    On the other hand, there was also thinking within ASEAN that  the political and security dialogue should be held at the ASEAN  Expanded Foreign Ministers' Conference. Just before the Manila  Conference, a conference was held in Jakarta. Those gathered  were exclusively director-level personnel of security issues  research institutions from the ASEAN countries. What I  discovered by attending this conference was that the ASEAN  scholars shared my thinking. One of the attendees, after  hearing the Nakayama proposal, even said "the ASEAN scholars'  contention was brought to governmental-level discussion through  the speech of the Japanese foreign minister. Now the discussion  will go forward."    As is clear from this story, as for the idea of utilizing  the ASEAN Expanded Foreign Ministers' Conference as a forum for  political and security dialogue, officials in Japan and the  ASEAN countries came to the same conclusion, though they came  from different positions. Moreover, anyone could come up with  the idea of utilizing the ASEAN Expanded Foreign Ministers'  Conference as a forum for such dialogue. What is important in  the details surrounding this issue is that the idea emerged from  within ASEAN and the opinion submitted by Japan, both mutually  supporting each other, and thus became a consensus among  nations, including such countries as the United States.    There is no doubt that Japan caused the United States to  consent to this process, and thus was useful for helping the  process go forward. It has also become clear that because Japan  had a certain persuasive power, Asian countries would take into  account what Japan had to say.  <H5>  Making Overtures to the United States </H5>   Secretary of State Baker's vague attitude toward the  Nakayama  proposal was somewhat unexpected because the bureaucratic  offices of the U.S. Government, not to mention Secretary Baker,  were well aware of and supported Japanese thinking.    We spent nearly one and a half years in completing the  Nakayama proposal, repeatedly exchanging opinions and "papers"  with officials in the State and Defense Departments as well as  the White House. At that time, the concern of U.S. Government  officials involved was focused on avoiding being pulled into  naval disarmament negotiations in which the initiative would be  taken by the Soviet Union. U.S. Government officials supported  the following points, which were the core of the Japanese idea:  1) as regards security in the Asia- Pacific region, we should  take a "comprehensive approach," utilizing already-existing  security treaties and other cooperation framework; 2) as for  multilateral cooperation which is lacking in this region, we  need to begin with political and security dialogue for the  entire region, and for that purpose it is most realistic to  utilize the ASEAN Expanded Foreign Ministers' Conference; and 3)  the participation of China, the Soviet Union, and Vietnam --  among others -- should be given consideration only after  conditions for doing so are in order.    I felt that, at a time when the U.S. Government and the  American people were focused on East-West German reunification  following the fall of the Berlin Wall, the spread of freedom in  East Europe, reforms in the Soviet Union, and so forth, U.S.  Government officials in charge of Asian policy preferred that  Japan take the lead in developing a security dialogue in the  Asia-Pacific region.    I once had a similar experience in the latter part of the  1970's. Soon after the Vietnam war, when the mood permeated the  United States that they did not ever want to be involved with  Southeast Asian problems again -- a mood especially prevalent in  the U.S. Congress -- Carter administration officials in charge  of Asian policy welcomed Japan's active foreign policy which  supported ASEAN, beginning when Prime Minister Fukuda visited  ASEAN in 1976. The concerned U.S. officials, recognizing the  Japanese Government was doing what the U.S. Government could not  even if it wanted to, accepted the U.S.-Japan partnership toward  ASEAN as "fruitful" for the United States (1979 Ohira-Carter  joint statement).    Later, the Bush administration expressly agreed in the  U.S.-Japan Global Partnership Plan issued in January 1992 to  "promote political dialogue among the Asia-Pacific countries  through an ASEAN Expanded Foreign Ministers' Conference."  Still, the United States had little interest in this issue.  Prime Minister Miyazawa's speech at the National Press Club in  Washington in July 1992 was to impress the United States with  the importance of security issues in the Asia- Pacific region.  In this speech, Prime Minister Miyazawa first indicated his  recognition that the existence of U.S. forces and the U.S.-Japan  Security Treaty were the indispensable premise for stability in  this region. He then advocated the so-called "two track  approach," which is to concurrently promote both international  cooperation aimed at solving disputes and confrontations in the  Korean peninsula and Cambodia, and dialogue and cooperation for  the entire region utilizing the ASEAN Expanded Foreign  Ministers' Conference and APEC.    Incidentally, the political declaration at the Munich  Summit,  which was held right after this speech and which accepted the  Japanese proposal, included the phrase "in the Asia-Pacific  region, regional frameworks which already exist -- such as the  ASEAN Expanded Foreign Ministers' Conference and APEC -- will  play an important role in promoting peace and stability." This  is the first such expression made at a summit meeting.  <H5>  Policy Coordination Will Become More Difficult </H5>   Japanese thinking concerning security matters in the  Asia-Pacific region has been reflected to a considerable degree  in the Clinton administration's policy. The Clinton  administration has supported the idea of discussing political  and security matters at the ASEAN Expanded Foreign Ministers'  Conference, and has indicated that the multi-tiered approach of  using already existing various organizations has promoted  security in this region. This is precisely the same recognition  we have.    Further, as I look back over the last year, the mutual  understanding between the U.S. and Japanese Governments  concerning the Asia-Pacific region was very good. On the issues  of North Korean nuclear arms development, the PRC, Vietnam,  peace in Cambodia, the ASEAN Expanded Foreign Ministers'  Conference, and APEC, the Clinton administration has pursued  policies which appeared to have fully taken into account  Japanese thinking. On the one hand, this is the result of the  Japanese Government taking the initiative and communicating its  thinking to the new administration in advance. On the other  hand, concerned officials in the Clinton administration have  adopted a posture of listening to other countries' thinking --  Japan's in particular -- prior to solidifying U.S. positions.    But we must be prepared to accept the fact that the  situation  will be different in the future. The United States has a  tendency, when it becomes interested in a certain issue, to set  its own goals one after another and try to achieve them in a  short time. A typical example is that President Clinton, as  soon as he became aware of the importance of APEC, proposed to  hold a summit-level conference. The U.S. advocacy of a "Pacific  community" is the same sort of thing.    The Clinton administration is expected to have a greater  interest in the Asia-Pacific region in the future. This is  because the dynamic economic development possibilities in the  Asia-Pacific region will be useful for the recovery of the U.S.  economy and the expansion of employment in the United States.  It is also because this economic benefit will provide suitable  persuasion in battling the isolationism which is gaining  strength in the United States.    That the United States is becoming more interested in the  Asia- Pacific region is to be welcomed. But we must keep in  mind there is a strong possibility that a gap could emerge  between the policy objectives of the United States, the  timetable to achieve those objectives, and what Japan and Asian  countries feel are appropriate.    There is also the possibility that a lack of U.S.  understanding of the Asian situation may come to the surface.  There are not a few Americans who are thoroughly familiar with  the Asian situation. The influence of Asian-Americans is  increasing. But American society as a whole does not yet know  about, and moreover has little interest in, Asia.    As for the aspect of adjusting policy between the United  States and Japan, the past format in which the Japanese  Government did what the U.S. Government could not do even if it  wanted to, or that Japan took initiatives in areas where the  U.S. had little interest, will not be possible. That is why it  will be necessary more than ever for Japan to come up first with  good ideas and take the initiative in bringing the United States  along.    Policy adjustments with countries in the Asia-Pacific region  are not easy either. The interests throughout this region are  not the same; especially on security matters, the situation is  significantly different between Northeast and Southeast Asia.  Also, Asian countries, while paying close attention, are  repelled by the strong arm tactics of the United States. As  regards Japan, they are suspicious about our increased influence  within the region, while at the same time expecting support from  us. Moreover, multinational discussions and cooperation will be  the center of regional cooperation in the future. Therefore, it  is important to make step by step efforts to come up with a  consensus in the region, even though it is time consuming.  <H5>  Promote a Multifaceted Approach -- Five Objectives To Pursue </H5>   As for the future approach, a "multi-faceted approach"  designed to simultaneously pursue the following five objectives  is important.    First, maintain the existing security framework and minimize  uneasiness over security matters during this time of change.    Second, strengthen efforts to secure long term stability in  areas where confrontations and disputes exist -- such as the  Korean peninsula, the South China Sea, Cambodia, and so forth.    Third, strengthen regional cooperation in trade and  economics  in order to promote economic development in each country in the  region.    Fourth, promote political and security dialogues throughout  the region, and increase the feeling of security among  individual countries within the region.    Fifth, strengthen the cooperative relationship between the  United States, Japan, and China.    As a result of this "multifaceted approach," ideas may  emerge  for forming organizations or the machinery for security concerns  within the region, or an international cooperation movement may  arise which will satisfy specific objectives -- such as PKO,  ocean patrols, or intelligence gathering for crisis management.  But these are all future possibilities and depend on how the  discussions will develop. Unlike in Europe, establishing  objectives to be reached and setting forth arguments -- to form  a collective defensive organization such as NATO or to form a  collective security organization such as the CSCE -- are not  suitable for this region.    The role Japan must perform in connection with each of these  five objectives is significant. The U.S.-Japan partnership is  the basis for everything.  <H5>  (1) Stability of the U.S.-Japan Relationship </H5>   It is not an exaggeration to say the stability of the  relationship between the United States and Japan is the premise  for peace and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region. But the  relationship of these two countries is now in a very grave  situation because of the trade and economic relationship.  Suspicion and a wary mood are evident when the two sides talk  about each other.    Overall, the relationship of mutual dependency between  the United States and Japan has deepened to an historically  unparalleled degree. Without doubt, the development of  administrative reform in the political and economic field will  increase U.S. trust in Japan. In fact, the active effort by the  Hosokawa government on political reform and deregulation is  received favorably in many sectors of the United States,  starting with President Clinton. We can also expect, in the mid  to long run, that suspicion directed against Japan by the U.S.  public will decrease if the U.S. realizes an economic recovery  and the American people regain their confidence.    The problem is in the short term. Frankly speaking, the  problem lies in the excessively large Japanese surplus and the  protectionism and isolationism which are gaining strength in  American public opinion. Moreover, these are mutually related.  To overcome such problems, we must bring the Uruguay Round to a  successful conclusion and open up a bright prospect for the  expansion of free trade. At the same time, we must shift the  foundation of trade and economic relationships between the  United States and Japan from confrontation to cooperation.    In this respect, it is important that Japan voluntarily  adopts various reform measures, namely a counter-plan to improve  business conditions, which includes tax system measures and  deregulation. These measures should, fundamentally, be taken by  Japan based on its own judgment and for its own needs. But  these are also in response to the expectations of members of  international society such as the United States. This is so  much the case that if Japan executes these steps voluntarily, it  will have the effect of making the negative image that "Japan  can decide only under pressure from foreign countries" a thing  of the past.    The "framework" discussion is also important. For its  success, efforts by both the United States and Japan are  necessary, and since it is a negotiation, what the outcome will  be is a matter left to the future. But it is important that  both the United States and Japan make progress in such a way  that they can explain to their own people that the negotiations  were successful. Three areas, governmental procurement,  automobiles, and insurance, are especially important. It is not  an exaggeration to say that success or failure of the third  Hosokawa-Clinton meeting depends on the outcome of negotiation  in these three areas.    As for security matters, on the other hand, Japanese support  for the United States under the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty is  receiving high marks not only from the U.S. Government, but also  from the U.S. Congress. This is significant also for the entire  Asia Pacific region because it is an important and persuasive  argument to help secure support from the Congress to continue  America's forward deployed strategy amid increasing calls for  military budget reduction in the U.S. Congress. It is also  important for the relationship of Japan and Asian countries to  cause Asian countries, which desire the continued presence of  the U.S. Forces, to deepen their understanding on this point.  <H3>  (2) Promotion Of International Cooperation For The Sake Of  Regional Stability </H3>   In this area, North Korean nuclear arms development is the  biggest issue now. Because the success or failure of the  nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty depends on this, it also has  world-wide significance. What is desired from the countries  involved -- Japan, the United States, and South Korea among  others -- is the use of all diplomatic means to cause the North  Koreans to give up nuclear arms development through dialogue.    On the other hand, to increase regional cooperation to  secure  long term stability in Northeast Asia is a subject we must think  about now. In this respect, the fact that the U.S.-Japan-South  Korean cooperative relationship has increased, with the North  Korean nuclear arms development as the occasion, and that China  and Russia share apprehension about the danger of nuclear arms  proliferation on the Korean peninsula, may lead to something.    Naturally, the five countries, Japan, the United States,  South Korea, China, and Russia should not unite to exclude North  Korea. Regional cooperation for the stability of Northeast Asia  must work in a direction which promotes stability on the Korean  peninsula and the reconciliation of North and South. In that  sense, the door must be left open for North Korea [when we talk  about] cooperation in this region.    Moreover, the situation in the South China Sea is still  unstable, and the peace in Cambodia is still fragile.  Cooperating with the ASEAN countries, the United States, China,  and Vietnam, consideration of a framework to secure long term  stability in East Asia is also one of the future tasks for  Japanese foreign policy.  <H5>  (3) Economic Development in Asia Pacific Region </H5>   The promotion of economic growth for the Asia Pacific region  is not only indispensable for the stability of this region, but  also is significant for the world economy. Moreover, the  economy of the Asia Pacific region, including China and Vietnam,  is expanding. To build a relationship of cooperation in this  region, which is based on the principles of free trade and is  open to the outside, is the task given today. As for the place  of discussion for this purpose, APEC exists. We can say that  the unofficial conference at the heads of government level which  was held in Seattle last November gave a good start for  cooperation in the trade and economic area among the countries  in this region.    The part Japan can play in the economic area is  significant because Japanese economic aid, investment,  technology, and the Japanese market are indispensable for the  further expansion and development of the Asia Pacific economy.  <H5>  (4) Heightened Feeling of Security </H5>   As for the area wide political and security dialogue, the  ASEAN regional forum, which is starting this year is expected to  play a central part. I want to point out here the importance of  the notion of "elevating the feeling of security," which Japan  has been advocating so far.    Often the term "confidence-building" is used. This concept  was born in the process of the East West negotiations during the  Cold War, and basically, its objective was to reduce the risk of  war between opposing camps. That may be the reason to inform  each other prior to military exercises and large scale movement  of troops and to permit aerial reconnaissance to form the  nucleus of so-called "confidence-building measures." Where this  is necessary in Asia may only be on the Korean peninsula.    The Asian countries do not view each other as antagonists.  On the other hand, because of historical particulars and  geographical proximity, differences in country size, and so  forth, it is difficult to erase mutual suspicion and mistrust  among the Asian countries. The point is clear when one looks at  the relationships between Japan and South Korea, and Japan and  China. The situation is similar between China and Southeast  Asia, and Vietnam and its neighboring countries. Further, in  the past several years, three uncertainties or apprehensions,  namely "how far will the United States reduce its presence?",  "How much will Japan strengthen its influence?", and "How much  will China expand its military power?" have increased.    Reducing such suspicion, mistrust, uncertainty, and  apprehension is basic to the Asia Pacific region's security.  For that purpose, dialogue among countries to discuss  everything is, above all else, important. Also, it is important  to further the cooperation through dialogue within the region to  raise the transparency of military budgets and the defense  policy of each country, to make clear the actual situation of  arms imports and exports, to place further regulations on the  transfer of conventional arms, and to prevent the proliferation  of mass destruction weapons such as nuclear ones.    But we should not just stop at such measures in the military  field. It has a significant meaning for raising a mutual sense  of security to think about, for example, worrisome matters which  are common to all countries in areas such as environmental and  refugee issues, and to cooperate for the solution of such  problems. It is equally important to increase mutual  understanding through measures such as cultural exchange,  academic exchange, and student exchange. Also, the efforts Japan  is making concerning the teaching of history for future  generations will provide a sense of security for people who feel  uneasy about a future Japan.    What the countries in this region must do to increase the  sense of security among themselves goes far beyond the so-called  "confidence-building measures." Also, to increase the sense of  security, it is important not only [to adopt] measures among the  governments, but also to have dialogue and cooperation in the  private sectors. Especially, when one thinks of the  relationship between China and Taiwan, the North Korean  participation issue, and the importance of obtaining fresh ideas  not constrained by existing policy, we can not stress too much  the importance of non- governmental level dialogue and  cooperation    The main role of the ASEAN regional forum seems to be to  stimulate and promote such wide ranging efforts.  <H5>  (5) Stability of U.S.-Japan-China Relationship </H5>   The direction the future U.S.-China-Japan relationship will  take will have a great influence on the future of the Asia  Pacific region. In that sense, the emergence of signs of the  improvement in U.S.-Chinese relations is to be welcomed. The  Clinton administration, out of consideration for the broader  perspective on the U.S.-China relationship, is also beginning to  take a posture to improve U.S.-China relations, while showing a  strong political interest in securing Chinese cooperation  concerning the protection of fundamental human rights and  nuclear non-proliferation policy. The Clinton-Jiang Zemin  meeting in Seattle was considered to be one of the great  opportunities in attempting to make progress on the U.S.-China  relationship.    The objectives and substance of policy toward China are,  naturally, different for Japan and for the United States. But  just as they are constructive partners concerning the issues on  the Asia Pacific region and global political and economic  issues, to work on [to influence] China is a task common to both  Japan and the United States. It will become more and more  important for the United States and Japan to pursue this common  task, while keeping in close touch with each other and keeping  Clinton's [proposed] visit to China in mind.    Also, it is true that Russia could play a constructive  part in this region. But for now, it is necessary to make a  case- by-case judgment on what sort of part Russia should play.  Also, Russia must have a better understanding that, to play a  political part in this region, it is important to solve the  Northern Territories issue and totally normalize the  Russo-Japanese relationship.  <H5>  Five Important Items for 1995 -- What Japan Must Do </H5>   In international politics it is extremely important to have  good timing. In that sense, next year will be a great chance  for Japan to take bold initiatives for the peace and prosperity  of the Asia Pacific region. A number of important events and  opportunities relevant to Japanese relationships in this region  will arise that year. We must start making preparation now.    First, 1995 is the 50th year since the end of the Pacific  War. Therefore, people of the countries which were involved in  the war will be looking back to that period, filled with  emotions. Also, for the Korean peninsula residents, which had  been annexed by Japan prior to the war, 15 August 1945 is the  memorial day at which time they gained independence from the  Japanese control which spanned over 36 years. The year 1995  also happens to be the 30th year since the establishment of  diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea.    The fact that Japan will declare its resolve to pass on what  history taught to future generations, will strengthen the moral  foundation of future Japanese foreign policy. But it is not  enough to reflect on and self-examine the past. It is extremely  important to begin taking action which will become the point of  departure for further securing the peace and prosperity of the  Asia Pacific region. To provide a bright prospect for the  security of the Asia Pacific region is its greatest given task.    At the same time, the Japanese may give thought on this  occasion to starting a large scale exchange plan funded by  Japan, similar to the Fulbright Program and the Rhodes  Scholarship, in an attempt to promote mutual understanding and  exchange among the people who will be the support and driving  force for the future of this region.    Second, 1995 is the 50th year since the atomic bomb was  dropped in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Moreover, the issue of  extending the nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty will be examined  internationally.    Japan, as the only country which suffered bombing by a  [nuclear] weapon, is in the position to take the leadership for  promotion of nuclear disarmament. In that sense, I think, it  may be an idea to plan some [event] in Japan, at which the  strict nuclear non-proliferation and the promotion of nuclear  arms reduction are to be pledged by the [participants] which  include the nuclear possessing countries headed by the United  States.    Third, 1995 is the 50th anniversary since the founding of  the  United Nations. Therefore, it will be a year some answers on  issues such as strengthening the United Nations and the  reorganization of the Security Council will be sought  internationally. I am hoping that at that time, the Asia  Pacific counties will provide active support for Japan to become  a permanent member of the Security Council.    What Japan has to do now is to express its thoughts on ways  to strengthen the United Nations in the post Cold War world and,  to that end, to [spell out] what kind of responsibilities and  what part Japan should carry out. Japan, as a non-nuclear  possessing country and the only sufferer of the [nuclear] bomb,  has the responsibility and the duty to consider the world's  security from a perspective different from the permanent  Security Council member countries.    On the other hand, strengthening the UN international  security function is connected to the security of Japan itself  and to the security of the Asia Pacific region. This is an  important point we must not forget when we consider  strengthening UN functions.    The review of our International Peace Cooperation Law three  years after it was put into force will also be made in 1995.  Needless to say, this review must be conducted, in conjunction  with the strengthening of the United Nations, in terms of  examining the role Japan has to play in it.    Fourth, 1995 will also be an important year for the  U.S.-Japan relationship, because both the review of the  "framework" negotiations in the economic area and the review of  the special agreement concerning the share of expenses for U.S.  Forces in Japan will be made that year.    The current special agreement (valid for five years)  concerning expenses for U.S. Forces in Japan will expire in  March 1996. If the same measures are to be continued after  April 1996, it will be necessary to conclude a new agreement  between the United States and Japan and to start making  preparations in 1995 for the process to obtain the Diet's  consent.    The necessity to do that is already clear. Though the Cold  War is over, Russia and China remain as nuclear possessing  countries, and North Korea's nuclear development issue is also  present. There is also a continuous rumor that China is  attempting to strengthen its naval forces. The armed  confrontation in the Korean peninsula is continuing and the  territorial dispute in the South China Sea contains the danger  of an armed struggle.    Under such circumstances, for Japan to firmly adhere to the-  no- nuclear-arms three principles and to the policy of not  becoming a military power which might threaten other countries,  while protecting its security, the American nuclear umbrella and  the presence of U.S. Forces in the Asia Pacific are  indispensable. What Japan can do in return for U.S. cooperation  is provision [offer] of bases and financial support for the U.S.  Forces.    On the other hand, efforts are necessary to solve various  problems which accompany the presence of the U.S. Forces. In  Okinawa, where the U.S. bases are concentrated, the vocal desire  for the consolidation of the bases is strong. Also, everywhere  in Japan, from the residents around the bases, complaints are  loudly heard about aircraft noise, especially night time  landings by aircraft carrier based airplanes. They are also  uneasy about the environmental problems related to the [presence  of] the U.S. bases. Therefore, to continue the support of the  United States under the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, it is  important to make visible progress on U.S. base consolidation  and on reducing the impact U.S. Forces' activities have on the  lives of the population [living around the bases].    It is the responsibility of both the United States and Japan  to strengthen the relationship of cooperation both in the trade  and economy and the political and security areas, and to make  efforts to provide a sense of security to the future of the Asia  Pacific region. Also, I want to point out that, conversely,  cooperating for the common goal which further solidifies peace  and prosperity of the Asia Pacific region will further open a  new phase in the partnership between the United States and Japan.    And fifth, in 1995 the APEC ministers meeting will be held  in  Japan. This is a year when countries in the Asia Pacific region  will be looking back at the past with various emotions and  thinking about the future. This will be a great opportunity for  Japan to take the initiative toward the Asia Pacific region. To  make use of the opportunity, in addition to strengthening  cooperation in the trade and economic area which is the original  purpose of APEC, it is important for Japan to take the  initiative on issues ranging from nuclear disarmament to youth  exchange, both within and outside APEC. It goes without saying  that all such Japanese efforts will lead to increased feelings  of security and trust toward Japan by the countries in the Asia  Pacific region.</p>

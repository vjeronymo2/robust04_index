			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Menem wants Iranian ambassador expelled Argentine President Carlos Menem said yesterday that Iran's ambassador to Buenos Aires should be expelled, after a judge investigating the bomb attack against a Jewish community centre last month had issued arrest warrants for four absent Iranian diplomats. However, the final decision lay with the foreign ministry, he said on radio. Last night the ambassador, Mr Habi Soleiman Pour, was called to the ministry but made no comment afterwards. Judge Juan Jose Galeano, on Tuesday night, accused seven Iranians - four former and three current diplomats at Iran's embassy in Buenos Aires - of having participated in both the bombing of the centre, which claimed 96 lives, and an attack on the Israeli embassy in Argentina, which killed 30 in 1992. Mr Galeano also charged three Argentinians who are claimed to have unwittingly reconditioned and sold the van used in the bombing. He accused them of having used stolen car parts. One of those charged, Mr Ariel Nitzcaner, is Jewish and a member of the bombed community centre. He claims police tortured him to extract information. Judge Galeano sent a preliminary report, late on Tuesday, to the Supreme Court requesting it demand that the three current diplomats have their immunity from prosecution waived. Iran's foreign ministry yesterday protested over the arrest warrants to Argentina's charge d'affaires in Tehran. Argentina could take diplomatic action against Tehran if officials refused to co-operate, Mr Guido di Tella, foreign minister, said. The government would first request that the suspects 'appear as witnesses, abandon their immunity, and only then, if they refuse, would we take measures.' Possible action includes declaring the diplomats persona non grata and ordering a reduction in embassy staff. Officials said cutting diplomatic relations with Iran would only be appropriate if investigators established Tehran's direct responsibility in the bombing. However, a European diplomat said: 'Argentina is right that there may well be Iranian involvement but whether they really have enough to prove a case in court is another question.'</p>

			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / International Company News: JVC sees return to the black this year JVC, the Japanese manufacturer of consumer audio-visual equipment, has posted a recurring first-half loss and passed its interim dividend. The group, however, managed to increase sales slightly in an extremely competitive market. Non-consolidated sales in the six months were Y259.7bn (Dollars 2.66bn), compared with Y251.4bn a year earlier. However, JVC still suffered a loss of Y1.9bn, although this was an improvement over the Y9.8bn loss made in the previous first half. The net loss was cut to Y2.9bn from Y10.6bn. JVC, which has been undergoing restructuring, said the yen's rapid appreciation against leading currencies had offset efforts to reshape the company. In addition, JVC, like other Japanese consumer electronics groups, has faced tougher competition in its own market. The consumer electronics market in Japan has been increasingly characterised by lower-priced products as consumers hold back from expensive purchases. Cheap audio-visual products have been coming into the country from lower-cost countries in the rest of Asia. JVC said it expected further turbulence as the yen continued to remain at a high level while competition in the audio-visual market was likely to remain fierce. It is forecasting that sales in the full year will reach Y530bn, against Y507.7bn, and hopes to return to the black with recurring profits of Y1bn, against a loss of Y19.5bn.</p>

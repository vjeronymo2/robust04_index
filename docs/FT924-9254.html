			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Delors and Gatt THE COMMISSION of the European Community is in disarray. Nowhere is this more evident than over the collapse of the trade talks with the US, which may yet lead to an out-and-out trade war. Mr Ray MacSharry, the European Community's redoubtable farm commissioner, has done an admirable job. Even though he comes from a country far more dependent on farming than France, which is the most outspoken opponent of a deal, Mr MacSharry has brokered an innovative farm policy reform for the EC and has also made a serious effort to reach agreement with the US over farm trade. Yet now he has resigned his position as negotiator. His justification for this decision, taken on the day the US announced its retaliation over the EC's failure to resolve the oilseeds dispute, is that Mr Jacques Delors, the EC's president, has informed him that the deal being reached would prove unacceptable. Yet Mr MacSharry himself believes that a reasonable deal could have been done with the Americans. If this is true, it is impossible to understand what Mr Delors thinks can be gained. How might a bitter round of tit-for-tat retaliation and counter-retaliation over oilseeds be in the interests of the Community? How, above all, might failure be justified when the differences between the two sides seem small in themselves and trivial in relation to what is at stake? Mr MacSharry must be told to complete a deal. Given the small differences remaining between the two sides, no conceivable deal could be worse than no deal at all. If Mr Delors is not prepared to allow Mr MacSharry to do his job, then his obstinacy should be tackled by the EC council as a whole. Mr Major's credibility as president of the EC has been much damaged. But he did put his good faith to the test this week and won. Now he should do everything he can to pull the EC back from the brink of a pointless and destructive trade war. If it is established that Mr Delors has indeed personally discouraged an achievable deal, his future must be placed in question, notwithstanding all his achievements. His term is due to last another two years, but he himself has already stated his preference for Mr Ruud Lubbers, the prime minister of the Netherlands, as his successor. Mr Lubbers may be needed well before 1994.</p>

			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Management: Re-engineering in small doses only Like powerful new drugs, fresh management concepts and techniques have a nasty habit of being lapped up by gullible and voracious consumers, who often misunderstand, misapply and abuse them. In the 1970s this happened with the Boston Consulting Group's (in) famous 'cash cow' portfolio planning matrix. Over-zealous use of it led many companies to dump or neglect perfectly sound businesses, and to diversify dangerously into others. An embarrassed BCG had to re-educate many clients, as well as its own publicity machine. In the late 1980s the malady hit total quality management: careless consultancy selling of it, plus inept client application, led many companies to ignore some of its basic principles, notably customer- focus and lack of bureaucracy. Painful experience taught them a salutary lesson, but in the process TQM got an unjustifiably bad name in some quarters. Now the same plague is infecting business process re-engineering. Barely a year ago it was being promoted as a clear concept, with two specific interpretations. The first was the redesign-from-scratch of broad, competitively 'core' business processes, such as product development and order fulfilment, in order to span previously separate departments (or 'functions'). As a result, companies were told, they could cut time and cost enormously, and also boost their revenues. The second interpretation was more far-reaching and, as yet, futuristic: the reconfiguring of entire organisation structures on to a 'horizontal' process basis. Now the concept, or at least the term, is being misapplied to all sorts of other changes, lesser as well as greater. Like a patient taking only a fraction of the prescribed dosage, far too many organisations are 're-engineering' narrow, isolated parts of secondary processes within individual departments, and are then losing heart, complaining that the results are too meagre. In reality, they are not re-engineering at all, merely improving their standard activities. At the other extreme, a few consultancies are attempting to extend the meaning of re-engineering from the 'hard' aspects of organisational change - structures and processes - to territory hitherto occupied by experts in the 'softer' aspects of change and transformation, notably managerial behaviour, attitudes and 'culture'. Like a doctor trying to extend specialist knowledge to related areas of medicine, this is an understandable strategy for an ambitious consultancy to adopt. But it risks stretching its expertise too thin, and creating even more confusion among the already bewildered business public. Evidence of just how far things are going awry, for all but the small minority of organisations applying the principle properly, came yesterday from probably the largest survey yet conducted into the 'state of re-engineering' in both Europe and North America. Covering 600 companies in a wide range of industries, the study was conducted by CSC Index, the management consultancy whose chairman, James Champy, helped create the current frenzy in collaboration with Michael Hammer. The survey reveals a string of problems. CSC Index's advice about how to deal with them is helpful for the most part, but not entirely consistent. Nor is every aspect of its own subtle but significant shift of emphasis from process re-engineering to fully-fledged corporate transformation. In essence, the main problem areas are: Poverty of ambition. Too few organisations are preceding their re-engineering of processes with a hard look at whether their ways of doing business - and even their corporate and business strategies - are still competitive. As a result, processes that should be dropped are being re-engineered, often at great pain and cost, while opportunities to use fresh ones for the creation of new businesses are being missed. Far too few companies are focusing on revenue growth; most are obsessed with cost - and staff-reduction. Not enough top and senior managers are sustaining - and demonstrating continually - their professed initial commitment to re-engineering programmes. Running such projects is very tricky, and cannot be assigned wholly to lower levels. Index argues correctly that re-engineering works best in organisations where employees really trust their managers, make many of their own decisions, believe they are paid for performance, operate well in teams, share information freely, and take risks. But such nirvanas are rare. The degree of change required to create them is so considerable that it is unrealistic for the consultancy to say merely that cultural change must start early in a re-engineering initiative. It must often precede it by several years, as it did in Champy and Hammer's original company 'models', Hallmark Cards and Bell Atlantic. This qualifies Index's frequent claim that 'real' re-engineering requires what it calls 'big change fast, to achieve big results fast'. In the narrower of the two original definitions of re-engineering - the redesign of processes - this is probably true, especially in situations where opposition can only be overcome through a crash programme. But this is not the way to win people's hearts and minds. In the wider sense of complete organisational transformation, 'big change fast' tends to be a contradiction in terms. As Index concludes, re-engineering needs to be applied much more judiciously than at present. For that to happen, managers and consultants alike must be clearer-headed about the nature of this potentially potent medicine. *Free summary from 071 344 7979 (fax).</p>

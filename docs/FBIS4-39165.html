			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev -- Oleksandr Tkachenko, deputy chairman of  Ukraine's Supreme Council, in the chair at the session on 3  June, announced a closed sitting, not naming the issues that  would be examined.    A UNIAN correspondent learned from unofficial sources that  material and domestic provisions for people's deputies were  discussed. It was stated that the state's Supreme Council and  leadership had been revealed as unprepared for the elections  taking place and for parliament being competent, because there  were not even enough places for deputies in hotels. Members of  the provisional commission for the provision of deputies'  accommodation noted that the granting of apartments to all  deputies is also still a problem.    After this some of the deputies expressed themselves in  favor  of the advisability of the existence of a semi-professional  parliament: half works permanently and half comes for the  sessions. This proposal caused the most arguments because such  a proposal would, in the first place, suit representatives from  government and commercial structures, who up to now have not  resigned from their previous place of work. People's deputy  Ivan Zayets maintained in his speech that he knows of one  building for deputies, which will be rented out in the district,  where he stood for election. Should the electors disagree with  parliament decisions, one may expect picketing of this building.    It was learned from the same sources that the closed sitting  was also about payment for the labor of people's deputies.  According to a deputy who did not wish to be named, the talk is  about a payment, which would only be sufficient for food.    At the sitting, Oleksandr Tkachenko reported that the  candidacy of Vitaliy Masol for the post of Ukraine's prime  minister would be submitted for examination by Ukraine's Supreme  Council on 14 June. The deputies are to determine their  positions regarding this in groups and commissions by the said  date.    Masol is a former chairman of the Council of Ministers of  the  Ukraine Soviet Socialist Republic, who resigned at the demand of  the hunger-striking students in October 1990. He is an  economist, who graduated from the Kiev polytechnic institute and  the institute of management of the national economy, and managed  a heavy machine-building enterprise. He was a people's deputy  of the Supreme Council of the Ukrain Soviet Socialist Republic  of the 9th-11th convocations, and also head of Ukraine's state  planning, a member of the Central Committee of the Communist  Party of the Soviet Union, and a deputy of the Supreme Council  of the USSR of the 10th-11th convocations. He will be 66 years  old in November 1994.</p>

			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Lasmo sheds 21p on Ultramar sale news LASMO, the UK exploration and production company, disappointed the market yesterday with its announcement that it could sell Ultramar's North American refineries and other assets for between Dollars 1.17bn and Dollars 1.27bn (Pounds 720m) by floating them off in North America. Lasmo acquired Ultramar's downstream assets last year after a Pounds 1.4bn takeover. The company listed them at book value of Pounds 915m in its annual report, and analysts had suggested they could be sold for between Pounds 700m and Pounds 1bn. Lasmo's shares dropped 21p to 217p on the news. The shares had been buoyed in recent weeks by speculation that Lasmo was about to announce the sale of the Wilmington refinery to Tosco Oil in the US. Market rumours of a takeover bid for Lasmo from British Gas or Total, the French oil company, had also boosted the company's share price. Mr Michael Pavia, Lasmo's finance director, said the company was still pursuing the possibility of a trade sale. This would probably produce a higher selling price, but the North American market for refining plant is currently depressed. Mr Pavia said the US Securities and Exchange Commission should give the go-ahead for an initial public offering (IPO) within a month. At that time, Lasmo will have to decide whether to float the refineries or continue to hold talks with prospective cash buyers. But the refineries should be sold by mid-year, Mr Pavia said, whichever route the company decided to pursue. He said interest in the refineries from other companies had been encouraging. But Mr Simon Flowers, industry analyst at County NatWest was sceptical, he said: 'They wouldn't be talking about doing an IPO if they could get immediate value from a cash sale.' See Lex</p>

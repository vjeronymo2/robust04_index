			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Major engulfed by recriminations: The fallout from last week's elections THE Conservatives have not lost their capacity to panic. Reeling from the shock of last week's elections, the party which once claimed unity as the bedrock of its success was engulfed at the weekend by accusations and recriminations. The inevitable - but ever more serious - calls for Mr Norman Lamont's replacement at the Treasury were accompanied by perhaps a dozen other, often conflicting, prescriptions for the government's ills. Some on the less-than-steady Tory back benches called for a wholesale shake-out of the cabinet. Others demanded a referendum on the Maastricht treaty. Yet others wanted a truce with the teachers over school tests. Some demanded drastic cuts in public spending to restore the government's sound finance credentials. Others said that Mr John Major has already compromised too much his appeal as a caring Conservative. A programme to chip away at the welfare state would be catastrophic. Nor were the divisions confined to the back benches. Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary at the Treasury, told television viewers that all would be well as long as the government stuck to controlling inflation, reducing borrowing, and reducing the role of the state. Simultaneously, a decidedly less sanguine Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, was telling a radio audience that the government needed to a new agenda to get out of its 'dreadful hole'. The overall effect was to magnify the impression of disarray. And amid the alarm came the thinly-veiled hints from some that Mr Major's authority was now in question: that unless he restored a grip on the government he could face a challenge to his leadership in the autumn. If there is a such challenge - and that remains a slim possibility rather than a probability - it will be a token one. Mounted by the band of about 30 or so hardline Tory Euro-sceptics, its aim would be to wound the prime minister rather than to replace him. There is no alternative figure in the cabinet ready to precipitate a leadership contest. The sceptics do not have a leader on the back benches comparable to Mr Michael Heseltine for whom a 'stalking horse' candidate might act as a proxy. But the fact that there is even a possibility of such a challenge carries two important messages for Mr Major. The first is that the implacable opponents of the Maastricht treaty on the Tory back benches have now established a party-within-a-party. With its own 'whipping' system at Westminster to ensure loyalty and a fanatical devotion to its cause, the group's approach bears striking similarities to Militant, the leftwing extremists who inflicted so much damage on Labour during the 1980s. The second, and more important, lesson that many in his cabinet want Mr Major to draw is that he must strengthen the support of his natural constituency on the party's centre-left. These are the ministers and MPs who rallied last year behind the prime minister's commitment to combine the free-market economics of the Thatcher era with the traditional Tory 'one-nation' approach to social policy. They feel that Mr Major should now move quickly to replace Mr Lamont. Many believe that he has compromised too much in his efforts to pacify the Euro-sceptics and other malcontents on the right of the party. They want the more robust approach to dissidents adopted by Mr Clarke. As one put it: 'John (Major) has to be nice to his friends as well as to his enemies.' Amid a cascade of contradictory advice, that is likely to prove the most important.</p>

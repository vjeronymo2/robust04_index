			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Coopers cleared in Maxwell probe Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm, has had its current procedures and auditing controls cleared by its professional body. The Audit Registration Committee of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales said yesterday that it had decided to propose no regulatory action. Its conclusion follows a special 'non-routine' visit from members of the profession's Joint Monitoring Unit which was triggered by the issues raised by Coopers' audit of the Maxwell groups of companies and pension schemes. The Joint Disciplinary Scheme, the accountancy profession's most senior regulatory body, is separately conducting an investigation into the Maxwell affair, including Coopers' role.</p>

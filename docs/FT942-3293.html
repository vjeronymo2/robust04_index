			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Marshalls advances by 64% Pre-tax profits of Marshalls, the Halifax-based building materials group, jumped by 64 per cent from Pounds 12.4m to Pounds 20.4m during the 12 months to the end of March as it took full advantage of the housing market recovery. Profits also were assisted by lengthening the depreciation period for large items of equipment from 10-15 years to 15-20 years. This added Pounds 2m to pre-tax profits and 1.8p to earnings, said Marshalls. Even without this adjustment, operating profits increased 58 per cent, from Pounds 12.4m to Pounds 21.7m. Earnings per share after the adjustment rose from 3.93p to 8.62p. Mr Andrew Marshall, chairman, said the trading improvement had been greater than expected enabling the group to increase its final dividend to 3p making a total for the year of 4.25p (4p). The group hoped to increase dividends further this year provided trading continued to improve. The recovery in the housing market prompted a 12 per cent rise in UK turnover of stone and concrete products, mainly for paving and flooring, to Pounds 143m (Pounds 127.7m). Operating profits, boosted by higher volume sales and increased emphasis on higher margin products rose by 44 per cent to Pounds 17.9m (Pounds 12.4m) including Pounds 1.6m from reduced depreciation. US losses for stone and concrete declined from Pounds 800,000 to Pounds 600,000. The US had generated a profit in the first two months of the current financial year, said Mr Marshall. Operating profits from clay products in the UK rose sharply from Pounds 255,000 to Pounds 3.1m against a turnover increase of just 14 per cent to Pounds 22.5m (Pounds 19.7m). The engineering division, which supplies equipment for drilling rock, also increased operating profit, from Pounds 889,000 to Pounds 1.29m. Net debt at the end of March stood at Pounds 25.4m (Pounds 21.3m) equivalent to gearing of 20.7 per cent (18.2 per cent). This, however, included Pounds 64m of cumulative convertible preference shares, redeemable in 2004 as equity.</p>

			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: QUARTET BY JEAN RHYS (CARROLL &amp; GRAF: $7.95)  </P> <P> The people in Jean Rhys' brittle novel, originally published in 1929, are as  stilted and artificial as the figures in an Erte lithograph.  </P> <P> When her husband is arrested for selling stolen artworks, Marya, an  Englishwoman living in Paris, is taken in by an Anglo-German couple, the  Heidlers. This hospitable gesture soon develops into a romantic polygon that  alternates between a triangle and a square. (As all four of them are too  languidly world-weary to do much more than drink and complain about how unhappy  they are, it's difficult to imagine them ever consummating a relationship.) The  characters in "Quartet" suggest that the members of "la generation perdue"  remained lost less through alienation than a lack of initiative.  </P></p>

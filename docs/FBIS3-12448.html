			<p>Language: <F P=105>Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of statement issued by the External Relations </F> Department of the Supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in  Iraq (SAIRI); date not given]    [Text]    Once again, the Israeli Zionists have committed a bloody  massacre, carried out this time in the sacred al-Ibrahimi  Mosque. Hundreds of Palestinian faithful were victims of this  massacre while praying at dawn on Friday last week during the  month of Ramadan. This crime is a manifestation of the constant  violations the Muslim Palestinian people are being subjected to.  It also brings to mind the Dayr Yasin massacre and other  methods of killing and oppressing Palestinians, which reveal  Israel's true morality.    This crime, which has shaken humanity's conscience, is a  warning to the Palestinian people not to feel at ease with their  enemies, not to give in to the imposed existing reality, and to  continue their struggle until victory. This horrible crime  exemplifies the inability of the Israeli enemy to stop the  intifadah. It also shows that the Israeli enemy is upset about  the heroism and steadfastness of the Palestinian people and the  stone-throwing generation, and wants to take revenge for the  Muslims' persistence in bearing sacrifices in order to maintain  the state of jihad and reject capitulation as 'Arafat and his  followers are doing.    The Israeli entity is fully responsible for this crime.  Those who protect this entity, including the forces of  arrogance, are also jointly responsible because they continue to  support this entity fully. The Muslim nations and peoples must  shoulder their responsibilities toward what the Palestinians are  being subjected to, such as humiliation and aggression, by  putting pressure on those with decision-making influence,  providing moral and material support for the Palestinian  people's jihad, demanding protection for the Palestinian  civilians through any means, and boosting morale in the Islamic  world to continue Muslim resistance to the status quo policy  which forces them to accept the legitimacy of the usurping  entity in Palestine.    The Iraqi people, who are also being subjected to the policy  of extreme oppression by Saddam's murderous regime, share the  sorrows of their brothers in Palestine over this tragedy. The  belief in sacrifice is the correct course for regaining one's  rights. The Iraqi people also believe that the foolishness of  Saddam Husayn and his regime in Iraq are in part responsible for  the current disintegration and weakness of the Islamic  countries' stands and duties toward the holy cause in Palestine.    We extend our condolences to all the aggrieved families and  share the sorrows of the struggling Muslim Palestinian people.  We believe that the souls of the innocent victims and the blood  of the wounded in the sacred al-Ibrahimi Mosque will be the fuel  that will feed the flames of the Palestinian intifadah and  revolution and consume the Israeli designs. We call on God the  Almighty to take the hand of the Muslims, lead them to their  dignified status, and make them triumph over their enemies.</p>

			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / International Company News: Elkem cuts losses at midway ELKEM, the troubled Norwegian light metals producer, has reduced first-half pre-tax losses, before extraordinary items, to NKr189m (Dollars 32.4m), down from NKr195m a year earlier. It also announced the sale of its Elkem Eiendom property business, for NKr222.5m cash to Gjelsten &amp; Roekke Eiendom, an Oslo property developer. Elkem said the disposal of the subsidiary with properties valued at NKr400m would produce a net gain of NKr50m in the third quarter. The sale, together with the recent disposal of a 50 per cent stake in Elkem-Rockwool will reduce group debt of NKr6.36bn by between NKr500m and NKr600m. However, group first-half pre-tax losses increased to NKr189m from NKr16m. Elkem said that last year's figure included a NKr179m gain from the disposal of Alcoa Nederland, in which it held 50 per cent. Elkem, nevertheless, reversed last year's first-half operating losses of NKr44m to operating profits of NKr30m. Group sales dipped 2 per cent to NKr3.818bn from NKr3.897bn and operating costs were reduced by 4.5 per cent to NKr3.590bn from NKr3.747bn. Elkem saw a big improvement in the second quarter, achieving operating profits of NKr37m, a turnround from losses of NKr7m in the first quarter and losses of NKr20m in last year's second quarter.</p>

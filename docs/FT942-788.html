			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Mexico Elections: Carpizo's standing boosted by abortive offer to quit - Mexico's interior minister is back, and stronger than ever. But who was he criticising? Mr Jorge Carpizo, Mexico's interior minister, could hardly have predicted the outcome. But in deciding to resign from his post on Friday, and then changing his mind under pressure on Sunday, he appears to have bolstered his position in the government. He came back to the job after most of the political parties and scores of non-partisan groups pleaded with him to stay. President Carlos Salinas spent two days in talks with him in a finally successful effort to make him withdraw his resignation. The wide show of support has given Mr Carpizo, respected for his independence and integrity, more authority than other members of the government. Hardline factions in both the governing and the opposition parties may find it more difficult to challenge him, or the Electoral Institute that he presides over, in coming months. Still, the alarm that greeted his resignation has underlined the fragile political situation in Mexico, and the temperamental nature of the man who will play the key role in overseeing the elections. That so much seemed to depend on Mr Carpizo and his willingness to stay reflects how much further the government has to go in building credibility for the electoral institutions. The attempted resignation has further called attention to the division in the ruling party between reformists and hardliners, which may surface again before or after the poll. While Mr Carpizo was ambiguous in giving reasons for his resignation, there seems little doubt that frustration with elements of the governing Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) played a part. He was appointed interior minister in January, 10 days after the Zapatista revolt in the state of Chiapas, replacing the hardline Mr Jose Patrocinio Gonzalez Garrido. A former rector of the National University, head of the National Human Rights Commission and attorney-general, he revealed earlier this year that he is not even a member of the ruling party. Within weeks of his appointment Mr Carpizo helped persuade all the main political parties to accept far-reaching democratic reforms, ending the ruling party's control of the electoral apparatus and tightening limits on campaign spending. But when resigning on Friday, Mr Carpizo denounced those who were obstructing his efforts to implement these democratic reforms. The uproar that followed his resignation reflected fears that the progress made since January would unravel, and Mexico would face a turbulent presidential election like that in 1988, when the opposition took to the streets after reports of widespread fraud. His resignation letter said: 'I have urged society and the government that we all work together exclusively for the truth; the only response has been more lies, more calumnies and more hypocrisy.' The interior minister reserved his most bitter comments for one political party which he did not name. 'In my job I promised to be impartial in my relation all the political parties. 'I am beginning not to be respected by one of the parties, given that I am not and cannot be in agreement with multiple acts of some of the sectors of this party.' The government has insisted that Mr Carpizo was referring to the leftist opposition Party of Democratic Revolution, which has criticised democratic reforms as insufficient, and with which Mr Carpizo has been fighting. The PRD has demanded another audit of electoral rolls, and a reduced role for Mr Carpizo in the elections. But leftist politicians and many analysts believe Mr Carpizo was alluding to the governing PRI, arguing that Mr Carpizo would not resign because of a difference with the opposition, since he has no obligation to be in agreement with it. Mr Carpizo's struggle with certain sectors of the PRI is no secret. The interior minister has reportedly threatened to resign three times this year because of opposition within the PRI to implementation of democratic reforms. Since the assassination of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, former presidential candidate of the PRI, the influence of the hardline faction in the PRI has risen, possibly exacerbating tensions with Mr Carpizo. The conservative faction appear to enjoy the backing of Mr Ernesto Zedillo, the PRI's new presidential candidate. Mr Zedillo has allied himself with many of the party's old-style politicians such as Mr Carlos Hank Gonzalez, the powerful agriculture minister, in an effort to shore up his support in the party. Recently, Mr Carpizo has become more isolated in the government. Last month Mr Diego Valades, the reform-minded attorney-general close to Mr Carpizo, was replaced by a little-known politician with ties to Mr Hank Gonzalez. Ten days ago Mr Manuel Camacho, the conciliatory peace commissioner in Chiapas, resigned, citing differences with Mr Zedillo. Now, however, Mr Carpizo is in the driving seat. It remains to be seen what he can do with his power.</p>

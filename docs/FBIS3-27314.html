			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, February 22 (XINHUA) -- China owes its  stability and development to the reform and open policy that has  been implemented over the past 15 years, top Chinese legislator  Qiao Shi said here today.    Qiao Shi, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National  People's Congress (NPC) of China, made these remarks when he met  with Nong Duc Manh, chairman of the National Assembly of  Vietnam, here this afternoon.    Nong and his party arrived in China February 21 as guests of  NPC's Standing Committee. This is the first Vietnamese  parliamentary delegation to visit China after the normalization  of ties between the two countries.    Qiao Shi appreciated the increasing exchange of visits by  leaders of the two countries and the growing bilateral  cooperation in political, economic and other spheres since the  normalization of relations between the two countries, saying  that that has laid a good foundation for the two countries to  further their cooperation.    Qiao told the Vietnamese guest that political and social  stability and economic development have enabled China to stand  the tests of the drastically changing international situation.    The experience of Western countries in economic development  is the creation of working peoples and is a common treasure of  all mankind, Qiao said. "We should study these experiences and  absorb those best suited to China's actual conditions."    Nong expressed the hope that the visit would enhance the  mutual understanding and friendship between the people of the  two countries and help to usher in a new phase of friendly  cooperation between Vietnamese National Assembly and China's NPC.    "We would like to know more about China's reform and opening  and further bilateral economic cooperation," he said.    With Vietnam now undergoing reforms, its National Assembly  is  faced with the heavy task of passing new laws, Nong said.    China's NPC has accumulated a lot of experience in this  regard, which is worth learning, he said.    He suggested that the two parliaments should enhance their  exchanges, especially the cooperation and exchanges between the  two sides' special committees.    NPC Vice-Chairman Wang Hanbin was present at today's  meeting.</p>

			<p><P> April 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A Paraguayan human rights group said it has discovered a clandestine cemetery  holding the remains of up to 40 political dissidents killed under the  government of deposed dictator Alfredo Stroessner. Francisco Jose de Vargas,  president of the Committee of Churches, told Reuters news agency that the site  in Colonia Esperanza, 44 miles northeast of Asuncion, consists of 30 to 40  graves. "It is a sort of clandestine graveyard used between 1963 and 1976," De  Vargas said, asserting that "they are political activists' graves, mostly  liberals or communists, some of whom were arrested before they were murdered."  Stroessner was toppled in a February coup after ruling Paraguay for 34 years.  </P></p>

			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Malaysian budget subdues Kuala Lumpur Tokyo Speculative trading dominated activity, and the Nikkei index closed almost unchanged, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average rose 8.80 to 19,805.16 after a high of 19,904.08 and a low of 19,725.65, down 0.5 per cent on the week. Shares initially rose on buying by public funds and brokerage dealers; but the gains were eroded later by selling of speculative shares, prompted by rumours that a consumer credit company based in Osaka had been declared bankrupt. Arbitrage buying finally supported the index just before the close. Volume was 255m shares against 209m. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 1.12 to 1,567.32 and the Nikkei 300 lost 0.35 to 286.79. Advances led declines by 485 to 462, with 207 issues remaining unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.57 to 1291.60. Japan Tobacco, whose shares were listed on Thursday, closed down Y40,000 at Y1.06m. Other privatised companies were also lower with Nippon Telegraph and Telephone down Y2,000 to Y890,000 and Japan Telecom losing Y80,000 at Y3.6m. Speculative stocks were sold on fears that credit for individual investors could be squeezed. Daikyo, a condominium maker, fell Y6 to Y769 and Hanwa Y17 to Y388. Foreign investors traded steels and other commodity linked issues: Nippon Steel, the day's most active issue, rose Y2 to Y396 and NKK added Y6 to Y297. Calsonic, a car parts maker affiliated to Nissan Motor, rose Y27 to Y766 on expectations of brisk earnings. However, car companies were sold on profit-taking, with Nissan down Y8 to Y824 and Toyota Motor losing Y10 to Y2,080. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 36.20 to 21,929.16 in volume of 44.7m shares. Roundup Wall Street's overnight gains had limited effect. Malaysia cut income taxes in yesterday's budget but the absence of further corporate tax cuts left its equity market relatively subdued. KUALA LUMPUR saw selling in the final half hour of trade and after a high of 1,119.14, the KLSE composite index ended 11.30 up at 1,113.04, a fraction down on the week. Brokers said that with the budget springing no positive surprises, the market may fall back into consolidation while investors look for fresh direction. SYDNEY lost its enthusiasm for commodity-based shares and the All Resources index dipped 7.8 to 1,415.1 as the All Ordinaries finished 11.3 lower at 2,020.9, 0.7 per cent lower on the week. Golds were among the weakest sectors, losing 1.5 per cent after the bullion price slipped below USDollars 390 overnight. The oil and gas sector was also weaker with Santos going ex-dividend, and Woodside Petroleum stock was upset by a report that BHP was planning to sell its 10 percent stake, fallling 7 cents to ADollars 4.95. BOMBAY faced selling pressure and the BSE 100 index fell 54.03 to 4,274.71, 0.8 per cent down on the week, as institutions made room in their portfolios before a number of private placings. HONG KONG extended its rebound to a third straight session, the Hang Seng index adding another 74.89 to 9,379.47 which put it 0.4 per cent up on the week. Anticipation of a Sino-British deal on Hong Kong's new airport financing and indications of an improving local property market continued to bolster sentiment, but turnover stayed sluggish at HKDollars 2.53bn up from Thursday's HKDollars 2.34bn. Good demand for a recent luxury flat sale by its property unit took Swire Pacific A up HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 57. Other property stocks also firmed, with Sun Hung Kai gaining HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 57.25 and Cheung Kong adding 50 cents to HKDollars 36.40. WELLINGTON ended the day marginally positive, with the NZSE-40 index up 4.74 at 2,095.17, but 1.6 per cent better on the week after another solid performance by Telecom, which rose 4 cents to NZDollars 5.64. TAIPEI offered a weak rebound after four straight days of falls, the weighted index closing 10.01 higher at 6,604.98, off a 6,561.71 low, 3.4 per cent lower on the week in turnover of TDollars 41.7bn.</p>

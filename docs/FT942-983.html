			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / PosTel vote threatens top company directors Directors of some of Britain's largest quoted companies are facing the embarrassing prospect of PosTel, the investment management group, voting against them at annual meetings this summer. Inquiries by the Financial Times show that directors of at least four companies in the FT-SE 100 will have PosTel voting against their election or re-election at AGMs next month. The first high-profile case is likely to be Mr Sipko Huismans, chief executive of Courtaulds, who is up for re-election on July 19. Last week PosTel's chief executive, Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, said that the fund management group would be voting against the election and re-election of directors who had rolling employment contracts longer than two years. The announcement followed mounting frustration among institutional shareholders over pay outs of up to three times basic salary to directors on three-year rolling contracts who are forced to resign. A fund manager said yesterday: 'It is going to be a long hot summer for some of the City's biggest names.' There are at least 133 directors from 29 companies in the FT-SE 100 who are on three-year rolling contracts. These include 13 executive directors at Unilever and seven at Tesco, where chairman Sir Ian MacLaurin faces opposition to his contract from PosTel. There are seven directors on three-year contracts at Glaxo, including Sir Richard Sykes, chief executive. The company was yesterday unable to say which of the directors would be standing for re-election at this year's AGM. PosTel says that in the past year several large companies have moved from three-year contracts to two years. At National Westminster Bank the three-year rolling contracts of Mr Derek Wanless, chief executive, and five other directors will end in two years' time and be replaced by one-year rolling contracts. Of 51 FT-SE 100 companies approached, at least 12 do not have any directors on three-year contracts.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------            DIRECTORS FACING POSTEL OPPOSITION NEXT MONTH  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Company            AGM date          Directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Courtaulds         July 19           Sipko Huismans Thames Water       July 26           Bill Harper; David Luffrum British Steel      July 27           Jeff Edington Scottish Power     July 27           Ian Russell; Michael Smith  -----------------------------------------------------------------------      COMPANIES WITH DIRECTORS ON THREE-YEAR ROLLING CONTRACTS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                         Number of directors with Company                                   three-year contracts  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Allied Lyons                                      3 Boots                                             7 BAT                                               3 Bowater                                           5 British Steel*                                    6 Blue Circle                                       5 Caradon                                           4 Courtaulds*                                       5 Glaxo                                             7 Guinness                                          4 HSBC Holdings                                     2 Inchape                                           1 Kingfisher                                        5 Ladbroke                                          2 Pearson                                           3 Powergen                                          1 Prudential                                        6 Rank                                              6 Redland                                           3 Reuters                                           5 Royal Ins                                         3 Scottish Power*                                   4 Tesco                                             7 Thames Water*                                     4 Thorn EMI                                         4 TI Group                                          5 United Biscuits                                   4 Unilever                                         13 Zeneca                                            5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Number includes directors in table above  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Consumer confidence slips back Consumer confidence has fallen this month, suggesting that the recent spate of good economic data has still not translated into any overall 'feelgood' factor. A survey issued by Gallup yesterday and conducted at the start of the month, before the recent interest-rate rise, shows that 31 per cent of people questioned expected their household's finances to deteriorate in the year ahead. This compares with 19 per cent who expected their household's finances to improve. The resulting proportion of those who expected an improvement rather than a decline is a negative balance of 12 per cent. In August the survey recorded a negative balance of 8. Gallup said yesterday, however, that the August figure was more optimistic than any earlier this year. Between February and May the survey indicated a negative balance of between 20 and 30. The last time the balance was positive was in May 1993. The latest survey is likely to fuel expectations that consumer spending, which provided the main trigger for the recovery last year, will slow in coming months - not least because the impact of April's tax increases is gradually eating into household budgets. Most analysts say that this should lead to a 'rebalancing' of the recovery as investment and exports start to play a more important role in it. A report by Oxford Economic Forecasting at the weekend forecast a surge in manufacturing and exports this year, particularly among capital goods producers. Nevertheless the survey suggests that the government faces a difficult task in persuading the public that the recovery is gathering pace. The proportion of the population who expect the economy to improve in the next year, compared with those who expect it to deteriorate, is a negative balance of 3 per cent this month. In August there was a negative balance of 1. The survey shows that almost a third of respondents expect unemployment to rise in the next 12 months - even though official unemployment figures have been falling. Editorial comment, Page 21</p>

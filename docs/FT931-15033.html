			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Iraq raid destroyed half its targets, says US THE US claimed yesterday that its raid on Iraq had succeeded, although it acknowledged that only half its targets were destroyed. At the same time, the incoming Clinton administration warned Iraqi president Saddam Hussein not to expect any softening of US policy. Mr Brent Scowcroft, national security adviser, said preliminary assessments showed that the US and allied air strikes on Wednesday had hit all eight anti-aircraft missile and radar sites in Iraq's southern no-fly zone and destroyed about half of them. After the raid none of the Iraqi air defence systems was in operation. President George Bush told reporters at the White House: 'Let's just hope that Saddam Hussein got the message. What our pilots did certainly sent that message loud and clear.' President-elect Bill Clinton said: 'There is no difference between my policy and the policy of the present administration.' He added that, based on Mr Saddam's conduct, he could imagine no circumstances in which he might normalise relations with Iraq. Earlier, in an interview with the New York Times, he said he was not obsessed with the idea of ousting Mr Saddam. If the Iraqi leader wanted a better relationship with the US, all he had to do was abide by UN requirements. 'I always tell everybody I am a Baptist, I believe in deathbed conversions,' Mr Clinton said. Mr Warren Christopher, Mr Clinton's nominee as secretary of state, said this should not be interpreted as an olive branch to Iraq. He said he was not optimistic about Mr Saddam's prospects for redemption. At most, he said, Mr Clinton would seek to prevent the feud from being personalised. Mr Clinton said he would not rule out using force against Mr Saddam again in the future, including, if necessary, re-engaging US ground troops. 'But I want to see what he does in response to this mission,' he said. Iraq said its radar had been switched off during the raids but was now fully operational. 'The aim was not to give a pretext for aggression,' a military spokesman said. 'Now, our anti-aircraft batteries . . . are prepared to confront hostile activity.' Iraq said its air defences had yesterday driven off two low-flying allied aircraft patrolling in the northern no-fly zone. Mr Saddam threatened earlier that any aircraft in Iraqi airspace would be a target. Meanwhile, Mr Tariq Aziz, deputy prime minister, said Iraq had accepted two of the UN demands which provoked the raids. It would stop its incursions into Kuwait near the port of Umm Qasr and would allow UN weapons inspectors to fly to Baghdad in their own aircraft. But he repeated that Iraq would never accept the two no-fly zones set up by the allies. The raids prompted some Arab criticism, led by Jordan and Egypt. They said the western allies applied double standards when it came to the enforcement of UN resolutions. Mr Esmat Abdel-Maguid, secretary-general of the Arab League, said military action against Iraq was not acceptable. 'The air attack by the three western countries is a threat to the territorial integrity of Iraq and to the safety of the Iraqi people,' he said. Mr Richard Cheney, US defence secretary, dismissed Iraqi claims of civilian casualties as 'gibberish'. Baghdad said 19 died in the air strike. US aircraft resumed patrols of the no-fly zone yesterday to complete damage assessments and to see if Iraqi aircraft seemed likely to retaliate.

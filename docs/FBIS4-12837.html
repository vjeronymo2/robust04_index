			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Lebanon Arrests Two Iraqi Diplomats </F> Following Assassination of Figure Opposed to Baghdad Government"]    [Excerpts] London, Beirut, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Lebanese  security forces yesterday announced that an Iraqi oppositionist  holding a Jordanian passport was shot dead the night before last  in the area of 'Ayn al-Tinah in Beirut.    Lebanese security forces said that the murdered person is  Talib Suhayl, an Iraqi oppositionist in exile who had lived in  Lebanon for several years. [passage omitted]    In London, the "Free Iraqi Council" [FIC], an Iraqi  opposition organization, has confirmed that Talib 'Ali Suhayl  was a member of the council's Central Committee and leader of  the Bani Tamim tribe. It added that he was found dead in his  apartment in Beirut the day before yesterday. FIC sources say  that early information indicates that Iraqi Government organs  were behind the assassination operation. In a statement, a copy  of which AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has received, the council said an  armed group stormed Talib Suhayl's apartment and shot him.    The council pointed out that the dead man had on several  occasions told his family and FIC Chairman Sa'd Salih Jabr about  telephone murder threats he had received in recent months from  elements belonging to the regime of Iraqi President Saddam  Husayn.    The statement, signed by Sa'd Salih Jabr, said that Talib  Suhayl was forced to leave Amman, his permanent residence, as a  result of these threats. He moved between a number of capitals,  the latest was Beirut. [passage omitted]    Elsewhere, the support office of the Supreme Assembly of the  Islamic Revolution in Iraq issued a statement yesterday in which  it cited strong rumors about President Saddam Husayn's health.  Dr. Hamid al-Bayyati, FIC representative in London, said that  circles close to the authorities (in Baghdad) leaked information  about Saddam's suffering from a serious illness as a result of  which he is confined to bed, and that a team of doctors are  supervising his treatment for hysterical nervous fits following  which he goes into a coma for many hours.</p>

Chien made the remarks during a one-hour speech to students  and faculty of the Harvard Business School. He spoke on  Taiwan's role in Asia-Pacific economic growth.    He noted that the Asia-Pacific, which boasts the highest  economic growth rate in the world, would benefit from the ROC's  participation in regional development and security programs.    He also said that closer regional economic, commercial and  technological cooperation is key to avoiding political and  military confrontation.    He stressed that as a member of the Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation (APEC) forum, Taiwan registers firmly its right to  participate in APEC meetings and activities on an equal basis  with other members.    "We intend to share our valuable developmental experience  with others by hosting more APEC activities in the future,"  Chien explained.    But Chien also said that Taiwan cannot tolerate the  introduction of political or sovereignty issues in the informal  consultative forum.    Chien said that the ROC is now devoting new emphasis to  establishing Taiwan as an Asia-Pacific regional operations  center, where people, capital, goods, and information can move  in and out freely.    In a question and answer session after the speech, Chien  reaffirmed that the ROC is a sovereign nation. He predicted  that when per-capita income in Mainland China reaches between  US$1,000 and US$2,000 by the year 2000, their people will yearn  for freedom, democracy and human rights.    After the speech, Chien and his wife called on the Governor  of Massachusetts William Weld. They exchanged gifts during a  cordial half-hour chat.    Chien also had lunch with professors of the Harvard Business  School at noon.    Chien will return to Taipei Friday after winding up his  weeklong visit in the U.S. during which he also made a speech at  Boston University.</p>

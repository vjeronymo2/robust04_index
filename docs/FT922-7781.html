			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Battle for Pacific Horizon PACIFIC Horizon Investment Trust has become a battleground after Jupiter Horizon, the trust's fund manager, yesterday blocked an agreed takeover and promised to produce rival reconstruction proposals. Martin Currie Pacific had made a recommended offer for the trust, which was born out of the Australian Investment Trust in 1989. But Jupiter Tyndall assembled a 25.1 per cent stake in the trust's warrants. That enabled the fund manager to block a resolution at an extraordinary meeting of warrant holders yesterday; the resolution required a 75 per cent majority, but only got 74.7 per cent. If approved, the resolution would have prompted Martin Currie to make an improved offer (at 93 per cent of the formula asset value) to ordinary shareholders. Following the resolution's failure, the offer will be just 92 per cent of FAV. Both offers exclude the 11 per cent of the portfolio invested in illiquid funds; that portion will be sold and the proceeds distributed to shareholders. Discretionary clients and managed funds of Jupiter Tyndall also have a stake of 15.4 per cent in the ordinary shares. Jupiter says it will not accept the offer and therefore Martin Currie will not be able to achieve the 90 per cent stake it needs to acquire compulsorily the outstanding shares. In these circumstances, Jupiter Tyndall says that the rights of the warrant holders will have to be substantially enhanced but this is disputed by the Pacific Horizon camp. Jupiter Tyndall said yesterday it intended to produce further proposals which would 'enhance shareholder value' and enable share and warrant holders to receive cash for all or part of their investment.</p>

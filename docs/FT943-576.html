			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazil sees foreign sales Sao Paulo dipped 0.9 per cent in moderate trade as foreign investors continued to sell ahead of the first round of Brazil's presidential elections on October 3. The Bovespa index closed 476 down at 52,175. Analysts commented that the market remained confident that Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the centre-right candidate, would tie up the elections in the first round; but some sceptical investors apparently preferred to take profits after a new opinion poll showing that the popularity of the leftist candidate Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva had risen. The market was also waiting for the results of new opinion polls expected to be released soon. There were unconfirmed rumours that Ibope and Datafolha could publish new surveys as early as today. Remarks by economy minister Ciro Gomes that October inflation could be around 2.0 per cent also weighed on shares.</p>

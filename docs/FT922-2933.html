			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Warning hits Whitecroft SHARES IN Whitecroft, the building products, lighting and textiles group, fell sharply again yesterday following its profit warning and change in dividend policy. The shares fell 20p to 72p, following their drop from 131p on Thursday. The company intends to cut its final dividend to 0.7p. This compares to the 7.7p forecast when it announced interim results in December and at the time of its rights issue last year. Profits for the year to March 31, to be released next Tuesday, will be at the bottom end of market expectations, it said. Forecasts have ranged from Pounds 4.5m to Pounds 5m. Mr Peter Goold, chairman, said the decisions were made following a review of prospects for this year. An expected fall in value of the property portfolio will be provided for as an extraordinary item.</p>

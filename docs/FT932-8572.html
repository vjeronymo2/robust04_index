			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rhodium market plunge undermines platinum metals SOUTH AFRICAN platinum group metals producers face having to cut output and shelve expansion projects because of the collapse in rhodium's price, suggests Johnson Matthey, the world's biggest platinum marketing group. The South Africans, who last year produced 73.5 per cent of the western world's rhodium supply, are unlikely to be compensated for the steep drop in revenue from rhodium by the recent surge in the price of platinum, which has been buoyed up by activity in the gold market. Mr Keith Green, operations director, precious metals division, for Johnson Matthey, said that in 1990 rhodium brought the South African platinum group metal producers revenue totalling USDollars 2.2bn. This year JM projects that rhodium revenue will fall to Dollars 1.7bn. Worries about production problems at Rustenburg Platinum's new refinery drove the price of rhodium, an essential material for some automotive catalysts, up from Dollars 1,280 in November 1989 to a record Dollars 7,000 a troy ounce in July 1990. Consequently, in 1990 rhodium contributed 45 per cent more revenue to the South African platinum group metal producers than did platinum. About 87 per cent of rhodium is used for automotive anti-pollution catalysts. High prices and weakening car sales caused the Japanese automotive companies in 1992 to use rhodium from strategic stocks accumulated over previous years and they virtually withdrew from the market. 'Industrial consumers also had surplus rhodium as a result of thrifting and recovery programmes put into operation after the escalation of the rhodium price in 1990,' JM points out in its annual survey of the platinum group metals market. Meanwhile, South African mines attempted to maximise revenues and their total rhodium output rose by 58,000 ounces to 278,000 ounces. This outweighed a reduction in Russian deliveries to the West, left total western supplies up by 30,000 ounces at 378,000 ounces and pushed the market into a surplus of 54,000 ounces. Rhodium's price was back at Dollars 1,850 at the end of 1992. It retreated to Dollars 1,400 an ounce in March this year, since when it has fallen below Dollars 800. Mr Green said at the launch of JM's platinum metals survey in London that it took only a very small surplus of rhodium to depress prices. South African producers were having to 'run fast to stand still' and they faced considerable financial pain if platinum remained about Dollars 360 an ounce and rhodium Dollars 900 an ounce. Japanese car producers also dug into their stocks of platinum last year and this caused a dip in purchases by the world automotive industry, from 1.56m ounces to 1.55m. Mr Jeremy Coombes, author of the annual survey, estimated that the Japanese car makers had reduced their platinum stocks from 18 months of supply to about six months. Other points from the survey were: Demand for platinum last year fell by 6 per cent to 3.8m ounces, mainly because of lower investment and industrial purchases. Supplies of newly mined platinum fell 8 per cent to 3.82m ounces following a sharp drop in Russian sales. Supply exceeded demand for the third successive year, by 20,000 ounces, down from 120,000 ounces in 1991. South African supplies were stable at 2.75m ounces. Russian shipments to the West fell by nearly a third to 750,000 ounces. Platinum's price last year averaged Dollars 360 an ounce, down from Dollars 376 in 1991. This year it is likely to range between Dollars 330 and Dollars 390 an ounce, 'unless an unexpected event occurs'.

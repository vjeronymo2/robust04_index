			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jean-Pierre Robin: "Credits: Matignon To Review </F> Situation With Bankers"]    [Text] The economic recovery should not be hampered by lack  of credit. This is the increasingly insistent theme taken up by  business leaders and members of parliament, which Edouard  Balladur will shortly discuss with representatives of the banks.  As was the case last November, the Matignon [office of the  prime minister] intends to bypass all problems which are tending  to slow down the distribution of credit to small- and  medium-sized businesses: interest rate levels, access to  financing, and lender guarantees.  <H5>  Point of Turnaround in August 1993 </H5>   The monthly statistics published yesterday by the Bank of  France, which go up to the end of February, confirm the  economy's volatility. "Over the past seven months, M1, i.e.,  currency in its most limited definition such as banknotes and  cash deposits, rose 4.1 percent (i.e., 7.1 percent annually),"  according to the statement released by the Bank of France.  Using the situation seven months ago is justified by the fact  that the month of August 1993 corresponds to the beginning of  the recovery.    The bank experts feel that there is no doubt that this  takeoff of "cash transactions" is "linked primarily to the  improved prospects for economic activity."    The other monetary and financial indicators, however, are  more uncertain. The money supply M3, which includes virtually  all means of payment, is continuing a downward trend (3.8  percent in one year). This is the result, we were told, of  intense arbitrage "in favor of savings and loan savings plans,  just before the announced drop in their yield rate."    If we go to the other side of the balance sheets to take a  look not at the money in circulation and savings, but at the  financing which has been made available to the economy, there is  not much change in the landscape. Overall, "total domestic  indebtedness" has risen 5 percent over one year. However, this  is used primarily to finance the public deficit, the financing  of which has risen by 26.3 percent over one year.    On the other hand, business debt has shrunk by 2.7 percent.  Only households are once again looking for credit (up 3 percent  over 12 months), a phenomenon which is relatively recent.  <H5>  Curious Paradox </H5>   If the recovery actually materializes, businesses will have  increased need for operating capital. Paradoxically, the  recovery is showing an upsurge in bankruptcies, warns Paul-Henri  Denieuil, the president of SFAC, the French Credit Insurance  Company.    "Access to credit" has become the main concern of small- and  medium-sized businesses. The cost of money takes second place,  although it has not disappeared. There is a curious paradox:  Banks are tending to no longer pass on drops in the Bank of  France's standard rates. "Like in the United States, French  financial establishments must become more solid before they  start lending again," an adviser on monetary policy explained.    There is still a trump card that can revive the banks'  desire  to lend: the reform of the 1985 law on bankruptcies.    The text, as it emerged from the joint (National  Assembly-Senate) parliamentary committee today, reestablishes  the safeguards that were requested by creditors.</p>

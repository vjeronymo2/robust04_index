			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Business and the Environment: Troubled waters - Victoria Griffith examines growing concerns about the ecological impact of fish farming The depletion of fish stocks around the world is triggering a boom in the fish farming industry, which pulls in Dollars 800m (Pounds 533m) a year in the US. By 2025, fish production will have to surge by 70 per cent to satisfy expected demand, according to estimates by the US Department of Commerce. Most of that increase will be met by fish cultivation or aquaculture. But concerns about the ecological impact of fish farming are growing in step with the industry. Originally embraced by environmentalists as a way to take pressure off natural fish stocks, fish farming is coming under attack as potentially harmful to the environment. One of the criticisms levied at the industry is that cultivated species, particularly in the US, are not species normally harvested in the wild. 'There is a lot of aquaculture for fish like catfish and trout whose stocks are not generally harvested in the wild, and therefore are not under that much pressure from over-fishing,' says David Harvey, aquaculture specialist with the US Department of Agriculture. 'Fish that are in real trouble, like cod, halibut and tuna, we're not yet very good at producing.' Many threatened species, such as tuna, are difficult to cultivate because they need a lot of room to move around. In other cases, fish farmers lack information about what the fish like to eat, particularly in the larval stage. 'For fish farming, you need higher survival rates than in the wild to make it commercially viable,' says John Nickum, an ecologist with the Fish and Wildlife Service in Washington. 'To do that, you need more information about the fish than we generally have available.' Ecologists have additional concerns. Many fish farms use cages in natural ponds, lakes and the ocean and therefore interact with the natural environment. 'With fish farming, you always get some genetic alteration, even if it's just selection for docility, traits like that,' says Robert Buchsbaum, coastal ecologist with the Massachusetts Audubon Society. 'Since there is always some escape of larvae from cages, there is a concern that they would disturb the ecological balance.' Those concerns multiply when the fish are non-native species. 'You hear people say that certain exotic species are not a threat because they could not survive by themselves in the wild,' says Buchsbaum. 'But there is a limit to how well you can control genetics. One operation in the north-west (of the US) says the exotic mussels they cultivate can grow, but not breed, in the cold weather. But what happens if the mussels adapt, and all of a sudden they can breed in the cold?' Ecologists are also concerned about the surge in licences issued to fish farmers to kill birds feasting on their stocks. 'For the bird, it just looks like a free lunch,' says Randall Snodgrass, director of wildlife policy for the National Audubon Society. 'But a lot of them get shot instead. Some of those birds may be threatened or endangered species.' Fish excrement and cast-off food can also cause problems. 'High-density fish waste, the kind you get with salmon, can have a negative environmental impact,' says James McVey, director of aquaculture at the National Sea Grant College Programme. 'Any time you've got all those extra nutrients going into the water environment - excrement, food bits that sink to the bottom - you can cause a shift in the ecology of the area.' Fish farmers say they are responding to environmental concerns. Sea Pride Industries, a company operating in the Gulf of Mexico, says it minimises its environmental impact by cultivating only native species such as red bass. 'As long as the fish are indigenous, there is not that much danger of environmental harm,' says John Ericsson, the group's president. Aquaculture advocates also stress that cultivation of endangered and threatened species is increasing. 'With more research, we are starting to have some success in cultivating shrimp, lobster and other species that are under pressure in the wild,' says Hank Parker, aquaculture co-ordinator for the US Department of Agriculture. 'This also makes good business sense, since prices for these species rise as the natural stocks get depleted.' Some fish farmers are moving to enclosed indoor tanks to prevent contact with the natural ecological system. 'Environmental concerns are one of the biggest constraints on industry growth right now,' says Joshua Goldman, president of Aquafuture, a fish farming concern that cultivates marine striped bass in an enclosed indoor tank. 'Through the tanks, we prevent any possible threat to the natural environment.' Despite the drawbacks, many ecologists see fish farming as a promising solution to over-fishing. 'There is clearly a positive side to aquaculture, in that it can discourage depletion of fish stocks,' says Buchsbaum. 'We just want to make sure it is carried out in a sensible way.'</p>

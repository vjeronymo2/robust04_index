			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE  </P> <P> Curtis R. Olson, a partner and half-owner of Newport Beach's Nexus USA Equities  -- one of the county's largest developers and real estate investors -- has  split from the firm to pursue "other personal and business interests." Scott T.  Burnham, Olson's partner and owner of the other half of Nexus, is forming a new  company, Burnham USA Equities. Burnham has essentially the same personnel as  Nexus, minus Olson. It will continue to manage such Nexus projects as the  $100-million Nexus City Square office and store project in Orange.  </P> <P> Also splitting from his old company is David E. Sigmond -- a partner at SDC  Development Co. in Newport Beach -- who is starting a new outfit called the  Sigmond Co. in Costa Mesa. The new firm will develop, manage and invest in  commercial buildings. While at SDC, Sigmond developed the McKinley Freeway  Showroom in Corona, a group of furniture stores visible from the freeway.  </P> <P> The largest undeveloped site zoned for commercial use in Yorba Linda is for  sale for $17 million. Sperry Van Ness, a Newport Beach broker, has the right to  sell the 32-acre parcel.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, also in Yorba Linda, construction is under way on a small shopping  center called Galleria de Yorba, developed by Orange's Corinthian Development  Co. The 15,000-square-foot center is expected to open in the fall with an El  Pollo Loco restaurant and a florist among the tenants. About half the space has  already been leased.  </P></p>

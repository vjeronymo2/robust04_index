			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Observer: Dead cert By contrast, there is never any debate about where the next Governor of the Bank of Japan will come from. The governorship alternates between an internal BoJ appointee and a man from the ministry of finance. Current holder Yasushi Mieno is a BoJ man and, even though he is highly regarded, there is no likelihood of his grooming one of his underlings as his successor. Tradition dictates that it is the finance ministry's turn for the job, and already the runners are mustering. An international reputation counts far less than an administrative background and appropriate seniority. Accordingly, the next boss of the BoJ is likely to be one of: Yoshiro Yoshino, 61, president of the People's Finance Corporation, an MoF quango; Akira Nishigaki, 62, president of the Overseas Economic Co-operation Fund; and Sadaaki Hirasawa, 60, a special adviser to an MoF think-tank. True, it isn't an inspired way of choosing a central bank chief. But one can't quibble about the BoJ's house-keeping.</p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Apex Trust terms are accepted by creditors THE FUTURE of Apex Trust, the charity that provides training for ex-offenders, seemed more assured yesterday after creditors, including the Department of Employment, accepted terms from court-appointed administrators. Apex Trust has been fighting voluntary liquidation since January because of cashflow shortfalls - after the setting up of Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs), which pay training providers in arrears - and muddles over government payments. The latter included a demand by the Department of Employment in January for repayment of Pounds 250,000 which it said it had paid to Apex last year. The department yesterday effectively wrote off the Pounds 250,000 when it and other unsecured creditors agreed to terms put to them by Cork Gully, the joint administrator. Unsecured creditors were owed Pounds 1.5m. Preferential creditors, including the Inland Revenue and Apex employees, agreed to accept payments due to them, amounting to about Pounds 300,000, in four equal instalments starting in April. The administration period will now extend to the end of March while the administrators continue to negotiate the necessary funding from the Home Office and the private sector. Cork Gully declined to say how much was needed. The charity had an overdraft of about Pounds 50,000 at the time of the government demand. Cork Gully said there was a 'reasonable chance' of Apex surviving. It did not have money in hand to cover preferential creditors but had a number of firm pledges of money.</p>

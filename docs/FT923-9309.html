			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Building on frail foundations: The prospects for Britain's construction sector Workers on British building sites are required to wear hard hats to protect themselves from objects falling from great heights. Such apparel might also be appropriate for shareholders of UK construction companies, which have seen the value of their investments plummet during the past three years. The only thing that has fallen further and faster than contractors' share prices is their profits. Many companies have been forced to cut or miss dividends as their earnings have slumped. Construction shares, based on the most recent earnings of the 28 companies within the FT-Actuaries Construction Index, are trading on a historic price/earnings (p/e) ratio of almost 40. The average for UK industry as a whole is just over 14. This suggests that either construction shares remain overvalued, in spite of the big falls in prices that already have occurred, or earnings have to recover much more sharply than the market average in the next few years to justify such a high rating. It is hard to see where such a recovery might come from. In particular, the economic conditions that allowed the industry to bounce back in the past may not recur. A large slice of the construction profits reported in the late 1980s came from inflationary increases of more than 30 per cent a year in land and property prices. But some senior industry executives believe that the high real interest rates and monetary disciplines imposed by membership of the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) mean that UK housing and commercial property profits may never be the same again. For the foreseeable future, the outlook for property prices, and hence profits, is bleak. House prices in southern and eastern England are on average 25 per cent to 30 per cent lower than their peak in 1988-89. Most construction companies do not expect house prices to show any real increase until 1994 at the earliest. Commercial property prices have collapsed in similar fashion, and may take even longer to recover given the overbuilding of offices which took place in the 1980s. Profit margins on UK contracting, meanwhile, have all but disappeared. Construction companies, desperate for cash in the form of advance payments, are taking work which does no more than cover overheads or may even incur a loss. Prices charged by contractors for construction work have fallen by up to 30 per cent since 1989, according to a survey of contractors, customers and building professionals conducted by the Financial Times. The fall in prices has as much to do with overcapacity in the industry as a decline in workload which in volume terms is no lower than it was in 1986-87. At the time, these were regarded as reasonable years for the construction industry. The sector, with an estimated 200,000 companies sharing a combined annual turnover of about Pounds 40bn, would appear ripe for rationalisation. Already large numbers of small to medium-sized contractors, including some public companies, have failed. More closures, and possibly some takeovers, seem inevitable. Syspas, a London-based firm of corporate analysts, calculates that 65 per cent of building companies quoted on the London Stock Exchange face at least a one-in-three chance of failing or being forced into a rescue package such as a merger or large-scale restructuring. Similar gloom is expressed by the Building Employers Confederation, the industry's largest trade association. It has warned that a further 40,000 construction jobs are likely to disappear by Christmas, taking the total jobs lost since the summer of 1989 to more than 300,000. Judging by the increasingly depressing output forecasts from the industry, it is going to be some time before prices start to rise again, leaving margins under ever-increasing pressure. All this points to a further round of dividend cuts later this year. Faced with such pressures on revenues and in a bid to reduce borrowings, larger companies such as Costain, Tarmac, Taylor Woodrow and Wimpey have been selling peripheral businesses acquired in better times to offset the cyclical swings in the industry and property markets. Costain, which made a Pounds 69.2m pre-tax loss last year and passed its final dividend, recently announced plans to sell a stake in its profitable Australian mining business. Wimpey has raised more than Pounds 300m from the disposal of properties, waste management and offshore engineering businesses. Tarmac has raised almost Pounds 100m from the sale of its UK bitumen-producing oil refinery operations and its California contracting and aggregate operations. It has also put its UK waste management business up for sale. Such disposals will, however, provide little comfort to those who purchased construction shares during the late 1980s and have seen the value of their investments already fall by almost 90 per cent. Shares in Costain, one of the great names of British contracting, have fallen by 88 per since March 1990, from 220p to just 26p at last night's close, reducing the company's market capitalisation from Pounds 505m to Pounds 62m. The last time Costain's shares were this low was at the end of 1976. At their peak in August 1987 the company was valued at Pounds 840m. Tarmac, Britain's biggest housebuilder, has also suffered on the stock market. It has seen the value of its shares fall by 83 per cent from a peak of 356p in May 1989 to 61p, valuing the company at Pounds 445m. Anybody bidding for Tarmac three years ago would have received little change from an offer of Pounds 3bn. In the current financial year, the expected absence of large property write-downs which had such an adverse impact on last year's results should provide some relief. But this does not overcome the basic lack of operating profitability. It is therefore difficult to see construction companies returning to the level of earnings or dividends that the stock market seems to expect. Some companies are likely to require intensive care for some time yet. Even when they recover, they may well find that life will never be the same again.  ------------------------------------------------------ COSTAIN  ------------------------------------------------------                               1987       89       91  ------------------------------------------------------ Pre-tax profits (pounds m)    68.7     57.7   (69.2) Dividend per share           9.65p   12.25p    4.75p Turnover (pounds bn)          0.87     1.33     1.32  ------------------------------------------------------ TARMAC  ------------------------------------------------------                               1987       89       91  ------------------------------------------------------ Pre-tax profits (pounds m)   265.4    377.0     21.0 Dividend per share           7.25p   11.25p     5.0p Turnover (pounds bn)          2.16     3.41     3.23  ------------------------------------------------------ TAYLOR WOODROW  ------------------------------------------------------                               1987       89       91  ------------------------------------------------------ Pre-tax profits (pounds m)    73.1    116.9    (2.7) Dividend per share            5.1p     8.7p     9.5p Turnover (pounds bn)          0.90     1.29     1.39  ------------------------------------------------------ WIMPEY (GEORGE)  ------------------------------------------------------                               1987       89       91  ------------------------------------------------------ Pre-tax profits (pounds m)    95.8    134.7   (16.1) Dividend per share            6.7p    10.5p    10.5p Turnover (pounds bn)          1.44     2.01     1.69  ------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Peugeot chief attacks 'suicidal' EC car pact with Japan THE agreement between the European Commission and the Japanese government on the level of Japanese car sales in Europe, and Japanese carmakers' interpretation of the deal, was 'unacceptable and suicidal for the European car industry,' Mr Jacques Calvet, chairman of Peugeot Citroen, said yesterday at the Frankfurt motor show. Mr Calvet called for a 'comprehensive renegotiation' of the agreement, reached in 1991 and put into force at the beginning of this year, or for a freeze on Japanese market share in the EC. The so-called Elements of Consensus agreement should be renegotiated 'in such a way as to provide true commercial and social reciprocity,' Mr Calvet said. Alternatively, Japanese penetration of the EC car market should be frozen at last year's level until west European car sales returned to volumes implicitly called for in the original agreement. Excess sales made by Japanese carmakers during such a freeze should be carried over and applied to future years. The 1991 agreement calls for the liberalisation of the European car market from the end of 1999, but Mr Calvet urged an extension of controls on Japanese vehicle imports beyond 1999 to allow EC carmakers to achieve the sales base 'guaranteed' by the original deal. EC carmakers fears about the operation of the EC monitoring system for Japanese vehicle imports have grown in the face of the steep 17 per cent decline in new car sales this year, At the weekend the Commission and Tokyo reached agreement on cutting Japanese shipments of cars and light commercial vehicles to the EC by 17.6 per cent, to 980,000 this year. But the European Automobile Manufacturers Association claims that with rising Japanese car output in the EC, the Japanese share of the market would still rise to 12.5 percent, from 11.3 per cent last year. Mr Calvet claimed yesterday that 2m-2.5m fewer cars would be sold in western Europe this year than in each of the previous three years, equivalent to the entire production of one of the big six volume carmakers in Europe. The slump was structural and not cyclical, Mr Calvet said. West Europe would experience this year the worst global economic recession and a sharper contraction in the car market than after the first energy crisis in the early 1970s.</p>

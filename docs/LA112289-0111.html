			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZNOST HITS A HIGH NOTE WITH SOVIET AND U.S. MUSICIANS  </P> <P> While Richie Cole was playing "Meadowlands" and "Bublitchki Bop" for his fans  in Tallinn, Estonia, on Tuesday night, Igor Bril and his All-Star Soviet Jazz  Quartet were showing off their repertoire, from "Body and Soul" to blues by  Bird, at Bon Appetit in Westwood.  </P> <P> It was a fair exchange, part of the two-way proliferation that has seen  avant-garde and Dixieland groups from Moscow and Leningrad on American turf  while touring U.S. jazz men in growing numbers discover with amazement the  extent of their fame in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Traveling with the Bril quartet, which played three Bay Area dates over the  weekend, is Alexei Batashev, the Soviet Union's foremost spokesman for jazz,  who was on the scene when Benny Goodman, breaking a longstanding sound barrier,  brought an all-star orchestra to the Soviet Union in 1962 (the premier  performance was attended by then-Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev). Batashev  wrote the first Soviet history book on the subject, emcees concerts, travels  around the world festival scene, and has his own TV show (something no American  jazz expert can claim).  </P> <P> "The changes are fantastic," Batashev said. "Moscow, where for years we had  only one jazz club, now has half a dozen, all with different programs daily.  </P> <P> "There are now 10 annual jazz festivals in the Soviet Union, and almost all of  them are international. Recently we had one in Tblisi featuring Freddie Hubbard  -- he has a terrific following in Russia -- as well as Art Blakey, Eddie Harris  and Jimmy Smith.  </P> <P> "Last month, Gene Harris' all-star big band stopped in Moscow during its world  tour and played to two sold-out houses. A great orchestra, with world-class  names like Ray Brown, Herb Ellis, Harry (Sweets) Edison. I introduced them, and  they got a tremendous reception."  </P> <P> Asked how seriously the once-banned art of jazz is now taken in his country,  Batashev said: "It is greatly respected. Of course, many musicians still are  inspired by listening to Americans, first on record and now more frequently in  person. But today, jazz is officially taught in many Soviet colleges and  conservatories."  </P> <P> Bril has been a part of the Soviet jazz scene for more than 20 years, having  made his debut as a so-called "lyrical romantic" at the Moscow "Jazz '65"  Festival. He wrote the first Soviet textbook of its kind, "The Basics of Jazz  Improvisation."  </P> <P> Now on his second visit to these shores but his first to California, pianist  and composer Bril is represented by a recent CD, "Live At the Village Gate"  (Mobile Fidelity MFCD 861). With him on the harrowing two-day journey (Moscow  to Shannon to Havana, then three stops in Mexico and finally San Francisco)  were Alexander Oseichuk, a prominent Soviet saxophonist; Victor Dvoskin, a  bassist who has topped the Soviet Jazz Critics' Poll for the last 10 years, and  Eugene Ryabol, 35, who in Moscow circles is considered the best drummer of his  generation.  </P> <P> Oseichuk is regarded as his country's most versatile saxophonist. "He started  out, of course, as a Charlie Parker fan," said Batashev, "but now he's an  admirer of Phil Woods. He is au courant with all the latest jazz trends, but he  is also a gifted classical musician."  </P> <P> The Bril quartet's predominantly mainstream repertoire mixes original works by  the leader with some of the orthodox jazz standards.  </P> <P> Where once the tours were all arranged by government officials in both  countries, today many musicians visit the Soviet Union independently. "We had a  big band from Oregon, a fine American college ensemble," Batashev said. "It is  no longer a problem getting to hear American jazz live."  </P> <P> The rosy picture presented by Batashev left one lingering doubt: Can the Soviet  scene have changed so drastically that there are now no difficulties at all?  </P> <P> "Oh, sure," Batashev said, "we have problems -- with instruments, with  equipment, and with the economic realities the audiences have to face. It's no  big fun going to a concert when you may miss an opportunity to stand in line  for milk."  </P></p>

			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / International Company News: Heinz fall distorted by last year's one-off gain HJ HEINZ, the US foods group, yesterday announced a 44 per cent drop in first-quarter net income - due to a one-off gain last year - but reported higher sales volume and underlying operating profits as its 1991 restructuring began producing results. The company reported a drop in net income, which totalled Dollars 143.79m, or 55 cents a share, in the quarter to July 29, compared with Dollars 254.43m, or 95 cents a share, in the same period of last year. The drop was due to a one-time Dollars 221.5m pre-tax gain the company made last year from the sale of the Hubinger Company, a corn-starch business. The disposal was part of a 'quiet restructuring' announced by Mr Tony O'Reilly, the group's Dublin-born chairman, which was designed to keep profits growing strongly, in spite of a mature US market. Other initiatives have included cost cutting, increased marketing and a realignment of the group's fast-growing Weight Watchers diet foods business. Heinz reported operating profits in the latest quarter of Dollars 259m, compared with Dollars 212m a year ago when the Hubinger gain is excluded. Analysts reckoned its earnings per share in the first quarter of last year totalled 44 cents. Heinz shares fell Dollars  3/8 to close at Dollars 41 1/2 . Mr O'Reilly yesterday told the annual meeting that the earnings figures were 'on track and in line with expectations' and reiterated his forecast of last March that earnings for this year would reach Dollars 2.60 a share compared with Dollars 2.40 last year. He added that sales were expected to exceed Dollars 7bn, up from Dollars 6.58bn. Sales in the first quarter totalled Dollars 1.56bn, up Dollars 64m, or 4.3 per cent, from Dollars 1.5bn last year. The company said this was due mainly to a 3 per cent increase in volume, with the fall in the dollar contributing about 1 per cent.</p>

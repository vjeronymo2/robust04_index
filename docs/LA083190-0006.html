			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FAX BLIZZARD URGED IN BID TO RESCUE CCC CENTER  </P> <P> Efforts to keep the California Conservation Corps in the San Fernando Valley  proceeded on two fronts Thursday.  </P> <P> Valley legislators mounted a campaign to inundate Gov. George Deukmejian with  letters urging that he rescind a budget cut that would close the corps' center  on Oat Mountain, north of Chatsworth.  </P> <P> And the CCC chief appealed for donation of an office in the Valley that the  corps could use if the center must close.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, the corps, which pays young people minimum wage to work on  natural resource and emergency assistance projects, announced plans to close  the Oat Mountain center by Oct. 5 due to budget cuts. Since 1978, an average of  60 to 80 CCC youths have lived in rugged dormitory quarters atop Oat Mountain  to work on Valley projects.  </P> <P> To ensure that closure won't result in reduced services for the Valley, the CCC  should open a satellite office that would be a daily congregation point for  corps members working in the Valley, said Bud Sheble, CCC executive director.  </P> <P> "That's my recommendation," Sheble said. "What we're seeking now is community  support."  </P> <P> Previously, the corps had considered replacing the Oat Mountain center by  staffing its Valley projects with CCC workers based at the agency's centers in  Camarillo, San Pedro and Pomona.  </P> <P> But the long commutes involved would delay the start of work and would lower  productivity, Sheble said. A better plan for maintaining service would be to  recruit CCC workers from the Valley, have them live at home and commute to a  satellite office each day, he said. The satellite office would be both a  morning congregation point for the work crews and a place to store tools and  vehicles, Sheble said.  </P> <P> Needed to make such a plan work, Sheble said, is someone to donate facilities  for a satellite office. "We're hoping leaders like Assemblyman Katz and Sen.  Robbins will help us in this regard," Sheble said.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Richard Katz, D-Sylmar, and Sen. Alan Robbins, D-Tarzana, have led  the protests against Oat Mountain's closure.  </P> <P> In the past few days, Katz, Robbins and Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson  have called on several hundred community leaders to fax letters to the governor  calling for money to keep Oat Mountain open.  </P> <P> As a way to bolster the CCC's budget, Katz said he has asked the governor to  consider advancing by two weeks the start-up date of a state tax on  out-of-state vehicles that do not meet California emission standards. That  measure alone could earn more than $7 million in additional revenue, he said.  </P> <P> "We've been through this before, and we won," Katz said. In the early 1980s,  Deukmejian cut funding for Oat Mountain from the budget, a move later reversed  amid an outcry similar to the one seen now, Katz said.  </P></p>

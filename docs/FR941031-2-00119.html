			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Benefit-Cost Analysis of Discretionary Capacity Projects <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. To ensure that AIP monies are invested wisely, the FAA will apply benefit-cost analysis (BCA) to eligible high priority projects intended to preserve or enhance capacity for which the total value of requested discretionary capacity grants is expected to equal or exceed $10 million over the life of the project. Included would be projects to add new capacity or reconstruct existing capacity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.1&blank;For each such project at or above the $10 million threshold, the FAA will simulate traffic flow at the existing airport to determine the hours of annual flight delay that would be prevented by the capacity project in question. Most reductions in delay attributable to capacity projects can be measured at the project airport level. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.2&blank;The FAA may utilize assessments of broader system delay reduction when investments at an airport are intended to relieve congestion at neighboring airports or when there is the likelihood that capacity improvements at a project airport will contribute significantly to delay reductions elsewhere in the regional or national system. The FAA will continue to improve its modeling procedures and capabilities to capture more fully the effects of projects on the national air transportation system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.3&blank;Capacity benefits expected to result from the proposed project will be quantified using methodology developed for the FAA's Airport Capacity Design Team studies. Annual delay savings will be modeled for three airport activity levels: current operations levels; intermediate-term operations levels (5 to 10 years out); and long-term operations levels (10 to 20 years out). Delay savings will be measured in hours and converted to monetary terms using aircraft operating costs and the value of air passenger time. Benefits for years in which activity levels fall between these three reference levels will be estimated through interpolation. Data on future activity levels will be taken from the FAA Terminal Area Forecast or an FAA-approved forecast in the Airport Master Plan or Draft/Final Environmental Impact Statement (whichever is most recent). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.4&blank;The FAA will collect data specific to airport/terminal airspace. Required data will include (but will not be limited to): the approved Airport Layout Plan; type of aircraft operations; fleet mix; peak-hour airfield mix by class; runway occupancy times; percentages of aircraft exiting at each taxiway; noise, obstruction, terrain, departure, and arrival constraints; air traffic arrival and departure streams; minimum vectoring altitudes; aircraft separation by aircraft type; length of and approach speeds on common approaches by aircraft type and weather; converging and/or parallel runway arrival and departure dependencies; and the different runway use configurations in the various wind and weather conditions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.5&blank;The FAA will consider project capacity and operational efficiency benefits other than delay reduction. Benefits that cannot be quantified will be considered in a qualitative sense. In the future, the FAA may broaden the scope of its capacity benefit measure to include value of producer and consumer surplus (or another measure of benefits). Adoption of new measures of capacity benefits will depend on development of methodologies for accurately quantifying these benefits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.6&blank;The FAA will measure total costs of project panning, construction, land acquisition, and operations and maintenance over a 20 year project life. Where appropriate, the FAA will include costs to airlines and the public due to operating delays caused by construction of the project and any costs to the community stemming from environmental impacts resulting from the project. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.7&blank;Project benefits and costs will be compared using standard discounted cash flow techniques as enunciated by the Office of Management and Budget in Circular No. A&hyph;94, ``Guidelines and Discount Rates for Benefit-Cost Analysis of Federal Programs.'' Circular No. A&hyph;94 currently mandates a discount rate of 7 percent in real terms. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.8&blank;On an annual basis, the FAA will re-evaluate the threshold value for total discretionary capacity grants at or above which a capacity project must subjected to BCA. Greater experience and improved modeling capabilities may allow the threshold to be reduced to capture a greater number of discretionary capacity projects. Different thresholds could be established for airport size categories identified in the Priority System. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.9&blank;In the future, the FAA will look to expand the application to BCA to non-capacity projects funded through discretionary funds. The FAA will consider the publication of detailed guidance on appropriate BCA methodologies and the assignment of some or all BCA responsibilities to project sponsors (subject to FAA review). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Implementation of Selection Criteria <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. The FAA will publish materials describing the implementation of the revised selection criteria. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.1&blank;By December 1995, the FAA will issue an amended Order 5100.38A that will incorporate the selection criteria described in this notice of policy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.2&blank;The FAA will incorporate information describing its AIP grant award decisions into its ``Annual Report of Accomplishments Under the Airport Improvement Program.'' The report will explain the application of project selection criteria. The first annual report including project selection information will be published by April 1, 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Other AIP Selection Criteria Initiatives <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5. The FAA's effort to improve the effectiveness of its investments in the airport system will be reinforced by other agency initiatives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5.1&blank;Concurrently with the issuance of this notice, the FAA is issuing a new policy on Letters of Intent (LOI) which will become effective in FY 1995. Under this new policy: LOI's will be limited to airside development projects which significantly enhance systemwide airport capacity; BCA will be applied to all LOI's; and the FAA will consider the financial commitment of the project sponsor to the project to be financed by the LOI. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5.2&blank;Consistent with Executive Order 12893, ``Principles for Federal Infrastructure Investments,'' the FAA will estimate anticipated aggregate benefits and costs of AIP authorization requests beginning with FY 1996. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Outreach Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 6. The FAA has established an outreach program to solicit advice from Congress, State and local governments, airports, airlines, interest groups, and the public on how to improve AIP selection criteria. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6.1&blank;The FAA will arrange for the Transportation Research Board to host an industry/academia/government symposium to solicit comments on the FAA's AIP project selection process and the use of BCA. The symposium will take place in Washington, DC, on October 27, 1994. A summary of the symposium proceedings will be available to interested parties upon request to the individuals named under the heading ``For Further Information Contact:''. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6.2&blank;The FAA will host informal meetings as requested with interested parties on the application of the new selection criteria to airport projects. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6.3&blank;The FAA will conduct a systematic assessment of and be responsive to comments it receives in the course of its administration of the revised selection process. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued in Washington, DC on October 26, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Cynthia D.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 8. The Commission requests that utility commenters include in their comments an estimate of the number of power sales contracts that they would seek to renegotiate to address stranded cost issues. How many of these contracts are silent on this question? How many have notice provisions, and of what duration? The Commission requests that responding utilities estimate the amount of stranded costs associated with such contracts, the relationship of the estimated stranded costs to the utility's total costs or revenues, and the potential cost shift to remaining customers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Should the limitations on recovery of stranded costs in wholesale transmission rates apply to all utilities, whether or not they currently have on file transmission tariffs containing stranded cost provisions?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Should stranded cost recovery be different depending on whether transmission service is under section 205 or 211?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. In lieu of direct assignment, should utilities be able to seek a general surcharge to all of their transmission customers to cover the costs stranded by a departing customer?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. The Commission recognizes that stranded costs can occur when a customer fails to renew its requirements contract and, instead of obtaining unbundled transmission service from its former requirements supplier, obtains unbundled transmission service from another utility. We anticipate that in such a case any prudent costs that are stranded as a result of the customer's departure would be reallocated to remaining customers in the utility's next requirements rate case. This results in the departing customer bearing none of the costs which it may have caused to be stranded. How should the Commission deal with such costs?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. The Commission invites comments on all aspects of the evidence necessary to demonstrate a reasonable expectation of continuing to serve a customer beyond the period provided for in a notice provision. Should there be a rebuttable presumption that the existence of a notice provision means the utility had no reasonable expectation of serving the customer beyond the end of that notice period? Should we adopt a minimum notice period that would provide a presumption that the utility had no reasonable expectation of continuing to provide service beyond the notice period,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  a five-year notice period?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14. In seeking stranded cost recovery, a utility must show that the stranded costs it incurred are not more than the customer would have contributed to the utility had the customer remained a wholesale requirements customer of the utility. This required evidentiary demonstration concerns the reasonable compensation for stranded costs. We request comments on what is reasonable compensation:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Would it be reasonable for the Commission to limit the annual amount of stranded costs that a power customer must pay to be no more than what the customer would have contributed to the utility's capital (customer revenues minus variable costs), or would some alternative concept be appropriate?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

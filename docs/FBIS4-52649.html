			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["S. Korean Puppets' Intrigue To Kidnap DPRK Lumbermen </F> Denounced" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 12 (KCNA) -- If the South Korean  rulers continue attempting to kidnap our lumbermen working in  the far east of Russia, they will drink a bitter cup, warned the  Ministry of Forestry of the Democratic People's Republic of  Korea in a statement today.    The statement reads:    On April 9, through a statement of the spokesman of the  Ministry of Forestry, we made clear our principled stand toward  the criminal intrigues of the South Korean rulers to kidnap our  timber fellers working in the far east of Russia. The South  Korean puppets, however, continue behaving arrogantly, ignoring  our logical warning.    According to recent reports from South Korea, the puppets,  in  an effort to make the kidnapping plot more organised, impudently  "adopted" what they call "principle of allowing exile" at the  "Unification and Security Policy Coordinating meeting" on April  15 and formed even a "working measure committee" on May 4 and  are blaring that they will work out "comprehensive measures" for  kidnapping our timber fellers.    On the other hand, they have sent agents of the "Security  Planning Board" and riff-raffs to various areas of the far east  of Russia under various names for an operation to allure and  kidnap our workers.    This indicates that the kidnapping intrigues of the South  Korean puppets have already entered a practical stage and the  North-South confrontation aggravated by them is being expanded  to the soil of Russia.    The Ministry of Forestry of the Democratic People's Republic  of Korea bitterly denounces the intrigues of the South Korean  puppets which are getting more desperate, branding them as an  open challenge to our Republic, an anti-humanitarian act  encroaching upon the dignity of our forestry workers and an act  intended to undermine the traditional friendship between the  Korean and Russian peoples.    These intrigues of the South Korean puppets have become a  serious matter related to the prospect of the North-South  relations and the dignity of the nation.    If they persist in their operation to kidnap our dignified  workers by misrepresenting facts, in defiance of our reasonable  warning, they will drink a bitter cup.    Our lumbermen working in the far east of Russia are now  getting very angry at their kidnapping operation. They are  resolved to deal a hard blow at the South Korean puppets who are  foolish enough to persistently try to make them defect to South  Korea.    If a mishap occurs to one of them, our lumbermen will make a  decisive reprisal on the South Korean puppets. Their resolution  is an entirely legitimate one for defending their dignity and  honor.    If the South Korean puppets continue attempting to kidnap  fellow countrymen and perpetrating provocations causing national  shame in an alien land in disregard of our patience, they will  be held wholly responsible for all the consequences arising  therefrom and the nation and history will pass a stern judgement  on them.    The South Korean puppets' plot to kidnap our lumbermen in  the  far east is an international crime to impair the traditional  friendship between the Korean and Russian peoples and create  unrest in the territories of Russia.    Therefore, we consider that the Russian authorities must not  allow the sinister acts of the South Korean puppets in the far  east.    We set store by the traditional friendship between the  peoples of Korea and Russia and are actively striving to  strengthen and develop it, and believe that the Russian  authorities will ponder over our principled stand.</p>

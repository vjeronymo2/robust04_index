			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Framlington seeks Dollars 50m for N Africa fund Framlington, the fund manager, is seeking to raise up to Dollars 50m (Pounds 33.3m) for an institutional fund investing in Morocco and Tunisia. The Framlington Maghreb fund, to be listed in Dublin, is being marketed throughout Europe and the US and will close at the end of June. Framlington and Banque Commerciale du Maroc, Morocco's largest private bank, are partners in the venture, and the International Finance Corporation is also expected to take a stake. At least two-thirds of the capital will be invested in Morocco, with the balance in Tunisia. The focus is on companies quoted on local stock markets with about 25 per cent of the capital earmarked for pre-flotation finance.</p>

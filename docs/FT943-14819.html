			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Bangkok elevated railway given the green light Victor Mallet in Bangkok The Thai cabinet yesterday gave the green light to a Dollars 1.5bn elevated railway for Bangkok, reversing a cabinet directive in May that all mass transit systems in the centre of the capital should be underground. 'It's a relief,' said Mr Edward Chow, chief financial officer of Bangkok Transit System Corp (BTSC). 'It means that we can get on with our work.' BTSC, part of the Tanayong property group, signed a 30-year concession agreement two years ago to build and operate the 24km elevated railway, but all Bangkok's mass transit projects have been thrown into doubt by successive governments lack of a coherent transport strategy. The cabinet apparently decided to adhere to the original BTSC contract following an embarrassing dispute over another contract for a Dollars 1bn elevated motorway, which was built by a consortium under the leadership of Kumagai Gumi of Japan. Thai state agencies were accused of breaching the contract and Kumagai Gumi and international lenders were eventually bought out by Thai investors. BTSC, which opened negotiations for the elevated railway with the Anglo-French engineering group GEC-Alsthom, says it has now dropped GEC-Alsthom and signed a letter of intent with another consortium comprising Siemens of Germany and Italian-Thai, the Thai construction company. They would carry out the Dollars 1bn turnkey contract to build the concrete structure and provide the train system. Mr Chow said BTSC hoped to sign a detailed turnkey contract before September and start operating the railway by the end of 1997. Stockbrokers believe Tanayong will find it difficult to secure financing for the deal. BTSC says debt financing is the responsibility of the turnkey contractors and maintains that it will not be a problem. 'All the financing has in fact been successfully negotiated,' Mr Chow said. He said Hermes, the German export credit agency, along with KFW and Deutsche Bank would participate in the financing. The International Finance Corporation, the private sector financing arm of the World Bank, was also prepared to arrange up to Dollars 350m in loans, he said. BTSC is wholly-owned by Tanayong, but the property company hopes to sell equity to other partners and list BTSC on the Stock Exchange of Thailand.</p>

			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / FT Pink Snow (7): Packing for the piste - Lucia van der Post advises on skiwear DRESSING for the slopes, if you are to get it right, involves, like most decisions in life, a little contemplation first. Honesty helps, too. Are you, for instance, a beginner, likely to be floundering in the sticky stuff that passes for snow on most nursery slopes? Or are you addicted to black runs, likely to be out all day long in tough conditions? Or are you really much, much more interested in how you look than how you ski? If you are not a serious skier and are more addicted to the afternoon passegiata than the piste, then you can afford to direct all your attention to how you look. The high-technology debate about which of the many micro-fibres is best for you and how to look chic and keep warm need not trouble you. As a broad rule of thumb the more fashionable the garment the less it is likely to perform in the severe conditions the piste poses. To get a combination of high fashion and the latest technology will mean paying higher prices. High fashion looks are copied from the catwalks. The silhouette remains based on the lean legging and the big, blousy, parka-style top. For real snow bunnies the lean, black ski pant topped by an eye-stopping gold jacket will ensure they are not overlooked. The problem, though, for beginners is that all that falling about means that they do need skiwear that really keeps the snow and damp out. The answer to this is layers. A modest outlay will bring you an outer layer which, though thin and not very warm, is waterproof. Pack under it layers, possibly a polar fleece jacket or shirt, or just thermal underwear and several sweaters and you could be reasonably economically equipped. Once you are off the beginners slope and start to take the big lifts up to the high pistes, the problems change a bit - now you will need gloves that really keep the cold out (double layers again are best, silk linings inside proper ski mittens) and anoraks that are wind as well as snow-proof. If you think this is a sport you are going to stick with you could probably afford to spend more on an outfit now and go for one of the newer microfibre fabrics. C &amp; A is much looked down upon in snooty circles (spot the C &amp; A is, I gather, a popular game among the Sloane chalet party set) but I think the company gives excellent value for money and if you keep to the less eye-catching and less obvious shapes and styles they are hard to beat. Prices are friendly - slim cord skipants for Pounds 22.50 and a belted biker skijacket for Pounds 59.99 means that even the most tentative would-be skier need not spend too much. When you reach that much-to-be-desired state of hardly falling down at all then you can afford, rather like the ski bunny, to think about fashion once again. You will, of course, need to keep out the damp and to keep warm. What you need now are lean, lean trousers (so aerodynamically effective) and a puffy, warm belted parka-style anorak. Of course, we all know that what the really expert show-off wears hasn't changed for years - 501s, a much-worn sweater and not much more. That's just to signal to us all that he never falls down, that feeling cold is for wimps and that whilst the rest of us may lumber our way down he whizzes down so fast that he hasn't time to catch pneumonia.</p>

The purpose of the DOE/EPSCoR Program is to enhance the capabilities of designated States to conduct nationally competitive energy-related research and to develop science and engineering manpower in energy-related areas to meet current and future needs in those areas. Subject to availability of funds, approximately $7 million will be available for awards under the DOE/EPSCoR Program in FY 1995 for collaborative research and manpower development in energy-related science and engineering disciplines.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Applications under this Notice should be received by 4:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, January 25, 1995.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Application materials are available from the Office of Science Education and Technical Information, ET&hyph;31, 1000 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20585.

Rep. No. 484, 103rd Cong., 2nd Sess., pg. 90) recommended that $7 million be committed to continuing the DOE/EPSCoR Program. In accordance with 10 CFR 600.7(b)(1), and to continue to enhance the competitiveness of states and territories identified for participation in the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) at the National Science Foundation (NSF), DOE has decided to continue to restrict eligibility to the following states and territory: Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Vermont, West Virginia, Wyoming, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Awards issued under this Notice will implement plans formulated under the previously awarded DOE/EPSCoR planning grants. New awards will provide funding for state management and coordination, human resource development activities, and research collaboration including student research activities. Approximately two to three new awards will be issued for a two-year period and up to a maximum of $1.25 million each for activities described above. In addition, DOE anticipates providing support for three to four renewal awards for projects begun under the DOE/EPSCoR initiative in FY 1993. Renewal awards will be issued for a one-year period and up to a maximum of $1.25 million. Any remaining balance of the estimated $7 million will be used to award funds to enable unsuccessful DOE/EPSCoR state committees to upgrade and refine state energy-related plans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, as a tangible measure of an applicant's commitment to the objectives of the DOE/EPSCoR Program, cost-sharing on a one-to-one ratio is a requirement of this program. Therefore, each application submitted requesting support from DOE under this Notice must provide, from non-Federal funds, an amount equal to the amount awarded by the DOE; i.e. for every dollar provided by DOE, the recipient must provide a dollar from non-Federal sources for the project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> General information about development and submission of applications, eligibility, limitations, evaluation, and selection processes, and other policies and procedures are contained in the Application Guide for the Office of Energy Research Financial Assistance Program and in 10 CFR part 605.

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / France detains 88 Algerian exiles FRENCH police detained 88 suspected Algerian Moslem fundamentalists yesterday as the government promised to crack down on terrorism after the kidnapping of three French officials in Algiers, Reuter reports from Paris. Thirteen of those detained, including two suspected fundamentalist leaders, would be held for up to four days during which the authorities would decide whether to open legal proceedings for terror-connected activities, officials said. The 75 others would be released within 24 hours but legal proceedings might be brought against some.</p>

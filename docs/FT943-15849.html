			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Arts: Jansons and the LSO - Concert This concert was part of the City of London Festival, though there was little to alert the audience to the fact. There was no mention of the festival in the evening's programme and if the Barbican has any City of London Festival leaflets on display, I did not find them. On the festival's side this is hard to explain. It is hardly plausible that it would want to hide any connection with a concert by the London Symphony Orchestra under Mariss Jansons, when the Corporation of London itself funds the Barbican Centre and is the principal sponsor of the orchestra. The standard achieved by these performers on Tuesday was also predictably high. Neither Jansons nor the violinist Midori has been particularly associated with Brahms in the past, so a performance by them of the Violin Concerto was likely to view the work from an unusual slant. In the event, Midori played the notes with exemplary cut-glass precision, fired with plenty of spontaneity, but the result was still brittle. There is a warm contentment at the heart of this music (Anne-Sophie Mutter's deep-seated relaxation as a performer homes in on it naturally) whereas Midori is always looking for tension. The rosy glow of Brahmsian colours does not feature on her tonal palette. The sturdy, rich texture of Brahms's orchestra is not second nature to Jansons either, but his ability to render an orchestra's sound crystal clear is so remarkable that complaining is out of the question. Given that he has never before shown ambitions as a Wagnerian (has he ever conducted any of the operas?) a selection of orchestral numbers from Wagner's operatic output was quite a novelty. The key item here was the Prelude and Liebestod from Tristan und Isolde. Cultured, perfectly balanced, onwardly flowing, flamboyant in the most exquisitely judged way, the performance shared characteristics with one of the most highly-regarded Wagnerians of the day: Carlos Kleiber, whose Tristan has passed into legend, not least because he never conducts it any more. The Funeral March from Gotterdammerung followed, then the Ride of the Valkyries - pure Jansons this number, bringing in the big tune on the trombones like the arrival of the heavy squad, then whipping up the pace to the end. The LSO responded to him with splendid playing. Perhaps an opera-house somewhere might take the plunge and give Jansons a whole Wagner opera. Admirers of this exciting conductor in London, however, will in future have to cross the river to see him with the London Philharmonic, for whom he is now principal guest conductor. They had better use his talents to the full.</p>

			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Prescriptions for world prosperity: Structural approach - Leaders of the Group of Seven leading industrialised states meet in Munich this week. Four senior economic ministers set out their contrasting views on the micro-economic and structural challenges facing the former states of the Soviet Union, eastern Europe and the west Since the first international economic summit in 1975, the event has functioned as the dais from which the leading western industrialised countries demonstrated their unity in the face of the communist threat. However, the end of the Cold war has begun to transform the summit into a forum where economic matters of the whole world including the former communist bloc are discussed. In this post-Cold war era, the discussions on the ways in which the G7 will support structural economic reform in the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe will, along with the talks on how to handle our own economic affairs, be an important issue. In both cases, I wish to emphasise the importance of a structural approach. In order for the former communist countries to put forward economic reform based on self-help, it is essential to develop an economic structure which will enable their private sector to realise its potential through policies in micro-economic fields such as the introduction of competition, the conversion of military production facilities to civilian use, the development of private companies and expansion of trade and investment. Without developing such structures, whatever funds we dedicate will not bring true economic reform. We will merely be forced to dedicate more and more resources. It is better to help someone achieve the ability to self-help than merely to provide charity. To quote an old Asian saying: 'Teaching how to catch fish is better than giving fish.' The importance of structural economic reform - removing impediments to the functioning of the free market and raising industrial productive capacity and competition - is applicable not only to support for the former communist bloc. The industrialised countries also have various problems of their own that must be overcome in realising a more efficient and open economy. To achieve strong and balanced growth the summit members must not only adopt growth-oriented fiscal and monetary policies but also proceed aggressively with structural reform. To facilitate structural economic reform a strengthening of the international institutional framework is essential. At the ministerial-level meeting of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in May, I proposed 'multilateral structural reform talks' and emphasised the importance of tackling our structural problems together. Furthermore, efforts by each country to improve its competitiveness are essential to the realisation of ever higher levels of competition. Business groups should also develop international co-operation and work together to develop new technologies and industries. Japan is promoting various trade and industry-related co-operation measures with European countries in search of the best balance between competition and harmony. In recent years, there has been an increased awareness that structural, micro-economic policies, together with macro-economic strategies, are important in achieving sustained growth of the world economy. I hope that at this summit the importance of structural reform in both areas - economic policies of G7 states and the economic reform of the former communist bloc - will be reconfirmed and a consensus be reached on the direction of future economic policies. The author is Japan's trade and industry minister.</p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (3): Small sums are not cost-effective - Overseas investment 1 / How it works / More investors are by-passing pooled funds. They must do some homework The staggering success of two recent launches of investment trusts specialising in Europe is a testimony to investors' willingness to spread their portfolios across foreign fields. The subsequent performance of these trusts has, alas, not lived up to expectations. And that may well leave people wondering whether there is any advantage in by-passing collective investments and choosing instead to invest directly in foreign equities. There is some evidence of a growing demand among private investors to go down the direct investment route. 'We could see there was a gap in the market at a time when there was increasing interest in Europe,' said Jeremy Lyon, of European Stockbrokers, launched last year. The firm's aim is to make dealing in European shares almost as easy as buying and selling ICI or Marks and Spencer. It acts on behalf of 40 to 50 brokers across the country, to give their private clients access to Europe. As well as providing an execution-only service, the firm offers research to brokers. While SEAQ International, in London, can deal in a number of European stocks, it was set up to deal with large institutional orders. European Stockbrokers, however, can deal in smaller sums of money, and in stocks which are not quoted in London. Apart from the currency risk, always an extra factor whichever way you choose to invest in foreign markets, the biggest problem facing investors is the extra costs. Dealing in small amounts is not cost-effective. Mr Lyon recommends a minimum deal size of Pounds 5,000. It is the movement and custody of share certificates that adds to the cost. Investors do not normally receive share certificates. This may make UK investors uneasy. In practice, it is something will have to get used to, even in the UK, with rolling settlement and later the new Crest electronic settlement system. There is a delivery charge for moving stock from one custodian to another, or for recording a change of ownership within one custodian. Then there is an annual holding charge, which will pay for the processing of dividend payments and of important company documents: for example, those relating to a rights issue or capitalisation. Killik &amp; Co, as an example, charge their normal commission rate of 1.65 per cent up to Pounds 10,000, minimum Pounds 50, on European stocks held through Euroclear, one of the main depots for holding bonds and equities. In addition, there will be a small Euroclear charge when you buy, plus an annual charge of Pounds 20 per stock. But some stocks, such as most Swiss ones, cannot be held through Euroclear. In this case, the initial charge for delivering the stock from one custodian to another could be around Pounds 40 to Pounds 50, with a further annual charge of Pounds 40 to Pounds 50. Killik's dealing commission is also higher for these shares, at 2.5 per cent on the first Pounds 5,000, 1.5 per cent on the next Pounds 5,000, subject to a minimum of Pounds 75. 'It is important that investors find out what the settlement charges are for the stock they want to deal in before they deal' said Matthew Orr, of Killik. He reckons that a minimum deal of Pounds 10,000 should be the norm in many cases. Getting an efficient rate of exchange for dealing is also an important consideration, according to David Plucinsky, of Fidelity Brokers. 'Investors should find out how their broker handles foreign currency. We have accounts in 26 different currencies, and can easily switch from one currency to another. We allow clients to pay for their deal in foreign currency, which can often mean they get a better rate of exchange,' said Plucinsky. He also warned that investors should be aware of the different settlement periods in different markets, which mean they can sometimes wait a long time before they receive their cash when they sell - notably in France and Italy. There are also pitfalls if shareholders do insist on holding certificates for foreign shares. Banking individual dividend payments in foreign currency can be expensive if you do not have a cash account through your broker. Another problem is that company documents will be sent out in the local language, whereas English-language translations are available if shares are held through an account with the broker. Being an American-owned firm, Fidelity is naturally geared up to dealing in US stocks. Fidelity's Paul Salariya is keen to stress that there really is no mystery to buying and selling US stocks. In fact, from the investors point of view it is like placing an order for UK shares. There is a sliding scale of commission, subject to a minimum of Dollars 38. The commission covers all charges, including holding stock in 'street name' (roughly equivalent to a nominee account) and dividend collection. You have to have a Fidelity money market account and sufficient funds before you place a purchase order. Another big American firm which has now set up shop on this side of the pond is Charles Schwab. Its dealing commissions are almost identical to those of Fidelity. Schwab does allow investors to take delivery of share certificates if they wish.

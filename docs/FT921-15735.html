			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Management: Why sparks are flying - The background to tensions between Britain's largest clothes retailer and its suppliers When the managers of a Midlands clothing company or a Yorkshire woollen mill talk about preparing for a 'royal visit', they are less likely to be referring to the Queen than a delegation from Marks and Spencer. Suppliers tell how factories are repainted, new uniforms issued and machinery scrubbed spotless in preparation for these visits. Such reverence speaks volumes about the exacting standards that M and S demands from its manufacturers. It also says much about the power that M and S exercises over them. M and S, or 'Baker Street' as its suppliers like to call it in reference to its head office, has dominated the UK's textile and clothing companies for decades. It is also an important customer for a string of other manufacturing industries such as food, drink, cosmetics and furniture. This year, M and S will buy more than Pounds 4.5bn of goods from its suppliers with more than 80 per cent of them manufactured in the UK. Baker Street is not only the biggest single customer of Britain's clothing companies - buying at least a quarter of all the clothing made in the country - it also exercises enormous influence over the whole industry's development. Clinton Silver, M and S's deputy chairman responsible for merchandise procurement, even suggests the company has helped save the sector. 'If we had a policy of buying as cheaply as we could and played harlot from supplier to supplier abroad, there would be no British textile industry,' he says. Many in the industry accept that this is true. Through its network of overseas stores, M and S has also been a significant exporter of UK goods. It accounts for 25 per cent of all UK clothing exports and achieves the impressive feat of selling fashion goods to France and British-made shirts to Hong Kong. Yet some manufacturers now suggest that this unique relationship - the envy of the retailing world - is under threat. Tensions are arising as a result of the recession and the shortening lead times in the supply chain that have resulted from greater use of information technology - a trend known in industry jargon as Quick Response. Over the years the suppliers have privately grumbled about the company and its tough negotiating tactics. But in recent months the grumbles have become much louder. Some suppliers - notably Steilmann, the German clothing group - have been groaning in public. These criticisms have been inflamed by the news of cutbacks at several long-established suppliers such as SR Gent, fuelling speculation that M and S has become even tougher, even too tough, with its manufacturers. The manner of M and S's dealings has also attracted fire and its decision to share the costs of the VAT increase between itself and its suppliers rather than raising prices provoked considerable antagonism. The head of one big clothing group said he was called into Baker Street and simply instructed to comply with the decision in 'an appallingly arrogant manner'. Another supplier described the group's behaviour as 'outrageously high-handed'. Silver, who has been at M and S for 40 years, seems unruffled by such criticisms although he accepts that the current recession has indeed exposed many difficulties. 'Recession finds out a number of problems and we had a new experience for me. A half a dozen of our suppliers went bankrupt,' he says. But although he greatly regrets these corporate collapses he vehemently rejects the charge that they were in any way the fault of M and S. 'I would say that every single one of them was tied up in imprudent financial activity taking over companies and expanding on the basis of debts which they were then unable to service,' he says. M and S accepts it is 'no pussycat' when it comes to negotiating with its suppliers but points out that many of its manufacturers have built their businesses on the back of M and S's success. 'They have grown from little rag trade businesses into successful public companies,' says Silver proudly. Many of these trading relationships stretch back 25, 50 or even 100 years and both sides have developed an intimate knowledge of each other's businesses, he says. Senior M and S directors meet the boards of each of its major suppliers twice a year where there are the 'the frankest of discussions' according to Silver. Martin Taylor, chief executive of Courtaulds Textiles, says it is 'stupid' for suppliers to blame M and S for their problems. He argues that the company simply acts as a transmission mechanism telling the companies what consumers are prepared to pay. Another industry figure comments: 'M and S is a tough negotiator on price, but so it always has been. If M and S seems tough with suppliers at present, that is a reflection of market conditions.' The rumpus over M and S's relations with its suppliers reflects the broader problems confronting the clothing industry. UK clothing companies have steadily lost share of their domestic market to lower cost producers from Asia, and more recently, Africa. The recession has merely accelerated the process, especially with the dollar standing where it does against sterling. Whether it likes it or not, M and S will find it increasingly difficult to continue to source clothing at a competitive cost in the UK. The fact that the proportion of goods the company buys in the UK has fallen over the past 40 years from 99 per cent to 83 per cent is indicative of the trend. Baker Street already buys some goods direct from the Far East although mainly for the top tiers of its catalogue. 'If you want hand-embroidered knitwear you have to go to the nimble fingers of the Far East,' Silver says. But he adds that M and S buys the overwhelming majority of the goods from the Far East through its existing UK suppliers, such as Courtaulds, Coats Viyella, SR Gent and William Baird, in order to preserve quality standards and simplify warehousing and distribution arrangements. But M and S would still prefer to have a strong flexible supplier base close to hand and has even encouraged overseas manufacturers to set up in the UK. For example, Delta, an Israeli manufacturer of leisurewear and underwear, has recently opened a factory in Scotland partly as a result of M and S's prompting. Silver argues that having a responsive local manufacturing base allows the retailer to work closely with the manufacturer to develop new products. He cites the example of machine-washable lambswool fabrics, and easy-to-iron cotton shirts which he describes as representing 'the essence of Marks and Spencer'. The massive investment that the best UK clothing companies have made in advanced manufacturing systems has also enabled them to retain a competitive edge in terms of speed, cost and flexibility. Designs of shirts which previously took weeks to change can now be altered in a matter of hours using computer-aided design and manufacturing techniques. Electronic data interchange (EDI) links have also been established between M and S and its suppliers allowing the supply chain to be managed more effectively. 'You do not just place a contract and wave goodbye to it. Sizes and colours can be altered as the public expresses its interest,' Silver says. But although such flexibility is of great advantage to M and S, it can turn out to be a nightmare for the supplier, which increasingly has to stock up with raw materials in advance of orders and second-guess future levels of demand. Silver accepts that quick response - or fast response as he calls it - can cause problems but argues that it has to be seen within the context of a stable trading relationship with regular predictable bulk orders being placed for about 80 per cent of its products. For example, in the summer M and S knows that 60 per cent of its women's blouses will be white. 'There is no point in moaning about it,' said one supplier of womenswear. 'We have all got to meet the technological challenge whether we like it or not and make sure that the right quantities arrive at the right quality when they are required.' Whatever the tensions in the relationship, there is a widespread recognition that suppliers would rather deal with M and S than most other retailers. 'M and S is always scrupulous in its dealings,' says Taylor of Courtaulds. 'They do not send back garments for spurious reasons. And M and S always, always pays on time.' M and S has indeed helped shelter the UK clothing industry from the coldest winds of international competition. But its ability to do so, while remaining fully competitive on the high street, will be sorely tested in the coming months as recession persists. The clothing industry is grimly bracing itself for another rash of casualties.  ------------------------------------------------------------------ UK AND REPUBLIC OF IRELAND SALES 1989-90  ------------------------------------------------------------------ PRODUCT GROUP             SALES POUNDS M    % TOTAL     % MARKET                             (ex VAT)         SALES       SHARE Women's outerwear             893             38          16.1 Women's underwear             430             18          33.9 Menswear                      725             31          16.9 Childrenswear/babywear        244             12          10.6 Accessories                    33              1           3.3  ------------------------------------------------------------------ TOTAL                       2,325            100          16.0  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Source: Verdict Estimates  ------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

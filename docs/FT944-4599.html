			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazil recedes 1.2% The Sao Paulo market receded 1.2 per cent in see-saw trade on continued speculation ahead of the futures index and options markets settlements on December 14 and 19. The Bovespa index ended 584 down at 45,730. Turnover totalled RDollars 292.4m. Analysts said stocks would remain fickle while players gear up for the settlements. The market, they added, was also digesting a central bank decision on Monday to create new reserve requirement rules for some credit operations. Reports that the central bank had intervened in the money market, repurchasing securities in a forward operation at 5.20 per cent for December 9, down from the current rate of 5.45 per cent, failed to excite much interest. The move was interpreted as a signal that the government would lower nominal interest rates on expectations of falling inflation data for December. Venezuela Caracas finished little changed in light dealings, the Merinvest composite index slipping 0.96 to 120.53. Electricidad de Caracas closed 4 bolivars down at 215 bolivars.</p>

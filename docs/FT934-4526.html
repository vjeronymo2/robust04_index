			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Companies fear effects of tax rises: Poll reveals concern that Budget will fail to speed up recovery The impact of Budget tax increases on consumer spending could undermine the accompanying measures intended to help businesses recover from the recession, according to an opinion poll among companies. Two-thirds of 150 companies surveyed this week fear that the combined impact of extra taxes announced earlier this year and those announced on Tuesday will hold back spending in the shops. The survey was carried out by NOP for the finance house Lombard North Central among companies in the manufacturing, construction, transport and distribution and service industries. The results show that the business community believes Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, delivered a politically skilful Budget that should be good for business in general. But there remain widespread reservations about its likely effectiveness. Nearly half of the companies surveyed consider the Budget has provided the basis for continuing economic recovery, but almost exactly the same proportion believe it will not have provided any additional stimulus. Opinions are divided as to whether the Budget will help pave the way for any further, early reductions in interest rates, which are still seen as key to helping speed the recovery. Neither do companies believe that the chancellor's measures - including improved export credit insurance cover and a cut in the cost of some premiums - will do much to help the export drive. Forty-five per cent of companies believe he should have done more. The chancellor will also be disappointed if he expected the Budget to give companies more confidence to step up sluggish spending programmes. Nearly a third of companies said that they were more optimistic about the outlook for investment within their own businesses after the Budget, but almost half said it would make no difference. Half of the companies in the transport and distribution sector, hit by higher excise and fuel duties, said they were now even more pessimistic on prospects for investment. Not surprisingly, business regards the Budget measures as being principally directed towards smaller companies. There is widespread approval of the proposed new apprenticeship scheme, but a majority of companies are not convinced the government will give it sufficient resources.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Verdict on Clarke  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Do you agree or disagree that this was a good Budget for businesses in general?

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of Executive Cars (10): Budget changes will work wonders - Advent of the Executive Diesel The chancellor of the exchequer's decision to tax company car benefits on list price alone, rather than on a combination of price and engine capacity, will do wonders for the diesel's share of the executive car market. So far, most of the growth in UK diesel registrations, which just topped 200,000 last year, has been in the below Pounds 15,000, under 2-litres size and price class. That was a reflection of the financial penalty - roughly a doubling of the monthly tax take - paid by executives public spirited enough to run environmentally-friendly diesel cars with engines bigger than 2 litres. The user-chooser who drives a Mercedes 190D 2.5 (list price Pounds 21,600) for between 2,000 and 18,000 business miles a year paid Pounds 2,300 tax under the old rules. This goes up to Pounds 2,481 in the current tax year but drops by Pounds 467 to Pounds 2,017 in tax year 1994-95. According to research by BRS Car Lease, 63 per cent of company car operators believe the budget changes will encourage drivers to switch to diesel. A similar number - 61 per cent - considered more companies would introduce diesel-only policies for their fleets. Hertz Leasing supports this view. It said the budget 'would stimulate companies to consider the environmental impact of road travel in a way that promotes thoughtful use.' This would mean the increased use of diesel cars 'which appear to have a positive contribution to make in reducing the emissions of a wide range of pollutants.' So the scene appears to be set for a considerable increase in registrations of all kinds of diesel-engined company cars and of executive models in particular. Glass's Guide, the motor trade's bible, forecasts 230,000 diesel registrations this year. This may well turn out to be an under-estimate. Much of the prejudice which used to lump all diesel cars together as slow, boring, noisy and smelly has been swept away. Now, almost the only motorists who believe such a calumny are those who have never driven a modern diesel car. While a diesel engine can never be quite as silent and refined as a petrol engine, some of the latest ones get very near to it. Improved technology - such items as two-stage injectors and electronically-controlled fuel pumps - have muffled the anvil chorus once heard when a car diesel was cold-started. When warmed up to proper running temperature, a modern small diesel does not clatter. It merely mutters. Outstanding among the smaller ones are the Citroen ZX 1.9td and the Vauxhall Astra, the latter fitted with a 1.7-litre engine supplied by GM's Japanese affiliate, Isuzu. With 92 horsepower and 130lb/ft torque, the Citroen has so much sparkle that it outperforms many petrol-engined cars in the same price class. A Volcane version, just introduced, looks what it is; a diesel GTi with a top speed of 115mph and 0-60mph acceleration in 10.3 seconds. The Isuzu 1.7 turbo engine (82bhp and 124lb/ft torque) has significantly boosted sales of both Vauxhall Astra and Cavalier diesels. The Citroen's refined and muscular 1.9-litre XUD unit will be seen shortly in the new Citroen Xantia (due in the UK in May) and Peugeot 306 diesels. Direct-injection engines provide even better fuel economy than those with indirect injection. Although Rover was first in the field with a direct-injection turbo-diesel car (the Montego), the most successful application so far is by Audi. The 1.9-litre Audi 80 and 2.5-litre Audi 100 TDI models are fast, with top speeds of 110mph and 124mph and 0-60 mph acceleration times of 14 seconds and 10.2 seconds respectively. The 80TDI averages 44.5mpg and the 100TDI, when equipped with a six-speed manual gearbox, a superb 46.4mpg. Now that the essential very high pressure fuel injection technology is well understood and the equipment economically feasible to make, many more cars will be fitted with direct injection diesels. Another growing trend will be the use of multi-valves, pioneered by PSA with the 2.1-litre, 12-valve Citroen XM and Peugeot 605 engines and soon to be taken a stage further by Mercedes-Benz, with 16-valve engines in the C-class. Today's diesel-engined executive cars are as quiet to cruise on motorways as their petrol-engined equivalents. The old idea that diesel car drivers were interested in nothing but economy was discarded long ago. Executive-class diesel users may now choose models with the highest trim and equipment levels, including ABS brakes, leather seats and air conditioning. One area in which progress still has to be made concerns automatic transmission. Few two-pedal diesels are available although Mercedes-Benz, which has offered it throughout its diesel car range for many years, is a notable exception. Citroen, too, has an automatic option in its small-medium ZX as well as the big XM which soon will be joined by two-pedal diesel Xantias. Vauxhall's Carlton is another good diesel automatic. It is a pity that the choice is so limited because automatic transmission marries very happily with a diesel engine in a car having adequate power-to-weight ratio. The argument against it has always been high cost. At one time the price premium for a diesel car was anything up to 10 per cent. Now it is far less and in some cases has virtually disappeared, due in part to the extra cost of fitting petrol cars with elaborate catalytic converters. It is not fanciful to suggest that as fuel prices steadily outpace inflation, the turbo-diesel - up to 30 per cent more economical - will become the typical executive car of the late 1990s. Drivers will grow used to tanking up at 500-mile intervals; companies will cut costs; and the environment will benefit.</p>

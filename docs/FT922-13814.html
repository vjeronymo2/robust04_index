			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Management (Marketing and Adveritising): Cleaning up on the housewives' choice Who is the TV advertisement for sanitary towels with wings supposed to be aimed at? Who are those 'housewives' who sit around with Clare Rayner, the agony aunt, enjoying a televised discussion about how dry their panties are? Where are the women who are moved by those whizzo cookers that produce food good enough to please the in-laws? Selling to women is a profitable business: the market is expected to reach Pounds 90bn by the end of the decade. Women are big buyers not just of cosmetics and cleaning fluids, but increasingly of cars and financial services, markets which were once the preserve of men. Yet the content of advertisements meant to tap this market often bears little relation to the kind of women likely to buy the products. The ad agency's 'housewife' still loves cleaning and cooking - she sometimes even spills things for the fun of cleaning up again. The new and equally implausible stereotype shows female top executives with sheer stockings and trim briefcases slipping into chauffeur-driven cars. Four real-life women, all ex-advertising agency and all with families, last week got together to form what they claim is the first advertising and marketing service geared at selling to women. They say it takes one to know one: as 90 per cent of ads are written by men, it is not surprising they fail to hit the mark. But surely these big companies have done their homework, and continue to use such advertisements because they work? 'They spend millions on advertising. If they used more tasteful advertisements, they might not have to spend so much,' says Anne Irwin-Brown, one of the four. An example of an advertisement that she thinks has got the balance right is for Oxo, in which the woman has a job, a sense of humour and a family, and is dashing out to an evening class. The problem goes deeper than just advertising, according to Irwin-Brown. While car companies, for instance, have long recognised that they should aim their advertising at women, the marketing message has not really got through. Indeed, the average car dealer, who is going to be making the sale, still tends either to flirt with or patronise his female customers. *The Female Advantage/Notman Parminter.

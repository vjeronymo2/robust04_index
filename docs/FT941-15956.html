			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / International Company News: Toys R Us announces Dollars 1bn share buy-back Toys R Us, the biggest US toy retailer, yesterday announced it would open 45 new toy stores in the US and 70 stores overseas this year. It has also signed franchise agreements covering Saudi Arabia and the Gulf emirates, and is to buy back up to Dollars 1bn worth of its shares over the next several years. The shares rose by Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 38 3/4 yesterday. Analysts said the store-opening programme was in line with expectations and the share buy-back plan would have a relatively small impact on earnings per share. Toys R Us has 581 stores in the US and 234 overseas, so the number of overseas stores will increase proportionally much more than the number of domestic stores. Part of the plan consists of signing franchise agreements which will bring the Toys R Us name to markets that would not otherwise have been entered for many years. Two agreements have been signed: one with an unnamed Saudi Arabian company for toy stores in Saudi Arabia, and another with Al Futtain Sons, a company based in the United Arab Emirates, for stores in the UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman and Kuwait.</p>

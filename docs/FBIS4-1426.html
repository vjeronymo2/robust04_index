			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Solly Liefman] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 27 SAPA -- An Independent  Electoral Commission [IEC] vehicle transporting ballot papers to  a polling station in Eldorado Park, southwest of Johannesburg,  was reportedly hijacked on Wednesday [27 April]. Police could  not comment immediately. It is understood the vehicle was  hijacked by four men on its way to a polling station at a school  in the area.    The vehicle was later recovered by police, with only four  boxes of ballot papers. The rest of the papers were missing.  The IEC men in the vehicle were unhurt. Two men were  reportedly arrested by police, but this could also not be  confirmed. IEC officials, escorted by police, went to collect  more ballot papers.    By just before noon on Wednesday, a 3km queue had developed  at the polling station. Also in the queue were scores of voters  from nearby squatter settlements and from Soweto and Pimville  townships, outside Eldorado Park.    Voting at the polling station in the coloured area began  just  after 7AM.</p>

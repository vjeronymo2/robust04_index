			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Slower French recovery forecast FRANCE is soon likely to show a further drop in economic activity, which will only pick up in the second half of next year thanks to a belated German recovery, OFCE, a leading Paris forecasting institute, said yesterday. The main reason why OFCE predicts that France's gross domestic product will grow by only 0.3 per cent in 1994, far below the government's median forecast of 1.4 per cent growth, is that the country's major partner, Germany, will not see recovery in its economy until the latter part of 1994, and even then first in German exports rather than imports. In last month's presentation of its 1994 budget plan, the government gave a revival in foreign demand for French goods as its main reason for sticking in its 1.4 per cent growth estimate. In the shorter term, OFCE is also more pessimistic than the government. It predicts that economic activity, stable in July-September after four successive quarters of decline, will now fall again by 0.2 per cent in the last quarter of this year and in the first three months of 1994. France may thus suffer a 'double dip' recession, because the government's very modest fiscal reflation this year and next - unsupported by any real relaxation so far in monetary policy - may not be enough to break the vicious circle between consumers' and companies' expectations that unemployment will continue to rise, their consequent disinclination to spend and invest more, and the knock-on effect that this has in the form of still more job lay-offs. The upshot, according to OFCE, is that unemployment will continue to rise - to 3.4m, or 12.4 per cent of the workforce, by the end of this year and to 3.7m, or 13.6 per cent, by end-1994. Mr Jean-Paul Fitoussi, head of OFCE, said the government's five-year employment law, which cleared the national assembly on Tuesday, and which introduces some new flexibility into pay rates and work patterns, was a move in the right direction, but not radical enough to shorten the dole queues much in the near term. With the absence of any clear panacea for France's chronic unemployment now making the political debate a bit less partisan, Mrs Martine Aubry, labour minister in the last Socialist government, unveiled on Tuesday night a new research foundation on employment issues. It has an initial FFr39m (Pounds 4.54m) capital provided by a number of company chairmen, many of them on the right in French politics.</p>

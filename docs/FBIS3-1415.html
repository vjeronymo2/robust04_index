The radio said Iraq security forces have started inspecting  houses of hundreds of persons suspected of removing the  diskettes, and have arrested a number of employees of related  departments.    It has not yet been clarified what data the diskettes  contained, but the way the Iraqi regime is treating the  suspects, the radio said it is likely that they might contain  vital security information.    What's more concerning for the regime is that foreign  embassies in Baghdad can get access to the diskettes.    The radio added that broadcast of the classified information  contained in the diskettes by internationl radio stations might  also be critical for the Iraqi regime.    Voice of the Iraqi People is an opposition radio operating  from somewhere inside Iraq. It did not give further details.</p>

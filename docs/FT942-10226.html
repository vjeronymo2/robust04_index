			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Survey of Spain (10): Dial D for dinosaur - A protected species Spain's telecommunications sector is a throwback to a time when the domestic economy was wholly inward-looking. Mr Jose Borrell, the public works minister, fiercely protects Telefonica, its prize dinosaur, from today's competitive climate. Perhaps nothing illustrates this more poignantly than Telefonica's tariff structure. The government-controlled monopoly operator has low rates for inner city calls and by far the highest for international connections. Mr Borrell is impenitent about his protectionist preferences. He argues that Telefonica, 32 per cent government-owned, the largest domestic employer and one of Spain's biggest corporate borrowers, needs to be nurtured in advance of the domestic industry's deregulation. But free marketeers suggest that his policy is likely to keep Telefonica fat and flabby rather than transform it to mean and hungry fitness. 'The Spanish government gives the impression of being determined to resist to its dying breath any liberalisation of the telecommunications market beyond that by which it is legally bound by EC regulations,' James Capel, the London-based security house, noted in a recent report. The minister has plenty of critics on the home front as well. In a swingeing attack on Mr Borrell's department, the government's fair trading agency asserted: 'Obviously, the Spanish economy cannot hope to be competitive with such expensive telecommunications.' Over the next four years, the domestic tariff structure will be turned on its head in order to adapt to a liberalised telecommunications market. Charges for inner city calls will be increased by 63 per cent, while the cost of international calls will come down by an average 40 per cent. The reduction is urgent, because users in Spain are increasingly bypassing Telefonica when making foreign connections. An outgoing call to the UK, for example, costs twice as much as an incoming call using BT or Mercury. There is less clarity over the deregulation of the cellular sector. Last month the government slashed prices by about 60 per cent in the mobile telephone sector which it controls, but has indicated that the award of a licence to a private cellular operator will be delayed. The cheaper rates should boost the analogue TMA cellular service, which is now offered by Telefonica before the introduction of updated GSM telephony under the deregulation package. The government originally promised to publish invitations to tender for two GSM licences - one of which will be reserved for Telefonica, the other going to a private operator - last year, but the new cellular services are now unlikely before next year. Mobile telephony is seen as an important growth market in Spain. It earned Telefonica Pta25bn (Dollars 181m) in 1992 and Mr Fernando Pardo, a telecommunications analyst at Price Waterhouse in Madrid, believes that the cellular business could represent an annual return of Pta250bn by 1997. Rival consortia seeking the licence include most of Spain's big banks and corporations in alliance with foreign groups such as GTE and BellSouth of the US and the UK's Vodaphone. The sting in the government's cellular deregulation plans is not so much delay as its decision, under the latest draft plan, to auction the private sector licence instead of inviting tender bids. The consortia could be forced to bid about Dollars 500m, according to Mr Pardo, in their effort to gain the cellular licence, while Telefonica obtains its own GSM licence free. The 'protect Telefonica at all costs' policy also seems to shape the government's approach to cable TV deregulation. Private sector critics say this draft law, which is now in its fifth but possibly not yet final version, is weighted towards Telefonica, which would control a great deal of the cable industry to protect its telephone business. Whatever the EU directives might dictate, the idea is that a dinosaur-friendly environment should, as far as possible, be maintained.</p>

			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Man in the News: Bulldozer brawn with a brain - Leon Brittan / Lionel Barber on Europe's chief Gatt negotiator Just before the climactic announcement of a deal in the Gatt world trade talks, Sir Leon Brittan stepped out of a Brussels conference room and paid a visit to the in-house canteen. Here was the prospect of a mouthwatering quote for the assembled media horde, along the lines of 'I'll take the ham sandwich and, by the way, where's the claret?'. Alas, the queues were interminable, the Gatt clock was ticking, and so the European Union's chief trade negotiator was forced to stop fraternising with the hoi polloi. The metamorphosis of Sir Leon from grand gourmet into homme ordinaire offers an insight into his wider ambitions. For even as a conclusion to the Uruguay Round drew close last Wednesday lunchtime, he was looking ahead to the next move: his bid to succeed Mr Jacques Delors next year as president of the European Commission. Until this week, it was easy to write off Sir Leon's chances of attaining the top job in the Commission. But the Gatt deal is a personal triumph which has seen his reputation as a high-powered, if aloof, intellectual transformed into that of a deal-maker on a grand scale. 'He has become a viable candidate,' says one senior Commission official. Seven years ago, Sir Leon's political career appeared finished. Memories of his involvement in a clumsy campaign during the Westland helicopter affair to discredit Mr Michael Heseltine, then UK defence secretary, might have faded. What has not faded is the the verdict of a fellow Conservative MP at the time: 'Too many brains, not enough common sense.' Yet Sir Leon has flourished since arriving in Brussels in 1989 to become senior UK commissioner responsible for competition policy. Although he keeps contact with friends in London and often spends weekends walking in his former constituency in Yorkshire, he seems happier jetting off to Moscow to see President Boris Yeltsin than suffering the sling-shots of the annual Conservative party conference. His success is a tribute to hard work, a willingess to pick first-rate staff and an unshakeable self-confidence. 'He has the style of a bulldozer,' says a senior EU official. An ability to plough through mind-numbing detail proved crucial as the EU's lead negotiator in the tortuous Gatt negotiations. 'The contrast with his predecessor (Frans Andriessen) could not be more marked,' says a Commission official. 'He listens to what his civil servants tell him, he uses their briefs, and he understands them. This is all highly motivating.' His eagerness occasionally borders on the impulsive. In early January, Sir Leon tried to strike a deal with the outgoing Bush administration on Gatt before he had been formally confirmed in his new post as Commissioner for External Economic Relations. He still insists he had a chance of converting his 'short twirl' with Mrs Carla Hills, then US trade representative, into an agreement. 'I just needed a month rather than two weeks.' Others disagree. 'In the beginning, Brittan wanted a deal at any cost,' says a veteran EU trade negotiator, 'but he ended up understanding that the Americans only respect hard bargaining.' This became evident during his relationship with Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative. At times, the two men looked like the Odd Couple on the international trade circuit: Sir Leon as the silken-tongued barrister from Cambridge and Yale Law School, and Mr Kantor, the country lawyer with the light Tennessee drawl. Sir Leon makes little pretence to personal chemistry with Mr Kantor and no reference to their common heritage as the descendants of Lithuanian Jews. 'Mickey Kantor is a deal-maker,' he says, 'he is a man you can do business with.' The moment that Sir Leon believed there was a deal to be done came when President Clinton renewed his 'fast-track' negotiating authority. This meant the US Congress could not attach treaty-wrecking amendments to a final Gatt text, provided a deal was struck before December 15. Sir Leon was determined to make December 15 stick. He knew that failure risked splitting the EU between a free-trading bloc led the UK and Germany, and a protectionist-leaning rump led by France. His strengths and weaknesses were less apparent in his dealings with the Americans than in his efforts to resolve internal differences among the Europeans. The job of chief EU trade negotiator requires the skills of juggler and tight-rope walker. As a member of the Commission, Sir Leon is the servant of the 12 member states. He must balance their (often conflicting) interests while following a mandate set out by the Council of Ministers. Simultaneously, he must show his interlocutors that he has the flexibility to negotiate and ultimately deliver a deal. This is a shade more complicated than the hand played by Mr Kantor. Late in the negotiations, the talk in Geneva was that the US trade representative was taking his instructions from two men only: President Clinton and Mr Jack Valenti, head of the powerful Motion Picture Association which was pressing for greater access to film and broadcasting markets in Europe. The charge against Sir Leon is that he lacks political touch in dealing with his European partners. An observer in the Council of Ministers says it was only late in the day that Sir Leon grasped the importance of keeping all member states on board during the negotiations - particularly the recalcitrant French. This lacuna resulted in an explosive encounter with Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister. The clash exposed the love-hate relationship which France has enjoyed with Sir Leon since he came to Europe. Although the French like to demonise him as a Anglo-Saxon free-marketeer, they are drawn to his intelligence, charm and vanity; in their eyes, he will always be the knighted member of the British upper class who can handle a French subjunctive clause. On September 20, Mr Juppe pressed a list of French demands for revisions of the EU-US Blair House accord limiting farm export subsidies. Sir Leon refused to have his hands tied, and still maintains that his stubbornness saved a Gatt deal: 'The French demands were extremely risky and could have led to disaster by provoking an outright American rejection.' A colleague agrees that Sir Leon was objectively right, but adds that facing down the French government risked weakening Paris's confidence in the Commission as an impartial negotiator. Similar doubts were shared by the Danes, Greeks, Spanish and Portuguese, all of whom felt they had been kept in the dark as the talks neared a conclusion. Sir Leon, ever agile, counters that he was never once pressed for information beyond what he was ready to reveal. 'They knew perfectly well what I was not saying. It was accepted, and it was acceptable.' But a Council official describes Sir Leon's self-righteous attitude as 'very British'. Sir Leon knows very well that he cannot afford to be labelled British at this stage in his career. Right now, being British in Brussels rates as a negative. Resentment lingers over Mr Major's article setting out a minimalist vision of European integration in The Economist; but the problem goes deeper. Sir Leon's tactics over the past 12 months have been to put discreet distance between himself and Mr John Major's government. Earlier this year, he warned Britain to take seriously the prospect of a 'hard-core' of member states moving towards European monetary union. He supports the concept of a common European foreign and security policy, and he has taken to chastising the US in public for not living up to its free-trade rhetoric. It may not be enough to win the top job in the Commission. He faces tough though undeclared competition from Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister and front runner, and the two seasoned Belgians, Mr Leo Tindemans and Mr Wilfred Martens, and possibly from Mr Peter Sutherland, the director-general of Gatt. Sir Leon inspires great loyalty among staff inside the Commission, who praise him for opening up information flows and streamlining the bureaucracy. 'He would be a godsend to the Community,' said one official, 'because somebody has to manage the Commission.' Sir Leon himself denies he is running for higher office. But he is willing to describe the qualities of a Commission president. 'You have to be capable of vision, and have the determination and energy to pursue that vision, as well as the capacity to persuade people that it is the right vision.' He adds, in matter of fact fashion, that his own vision of Europe will appear in a book 'published by Hamish Hamilton on March 31'. This happens to be just three months before the European summit in Corfu will choose a successor to Mr Delors. There is always an element of calculation about Sir Leon, a hint of a wider game-plan. No doubt the Gatt trade deal has forced everyone to take a second look at his pending candidacy; but he must still overcome residual suspicions about anything British in Europe. It is a hard sell.</p>

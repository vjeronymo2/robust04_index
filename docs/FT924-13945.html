			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Race to get the systems right - Computers Most companies are now faced with a race against time to make the necessary modifications to their core computer systems to meet the requirements of the new regulations. The alternative will be a time consuming and expensive monthly struggle to collate information manually. Many, however, have still to tackle the strategic issues concerned with changing business practices to meet the 1993 requirements, let alone modifying their computer systems to produce the information. Some estimates indicate that only 10 per cent of the 30,000 companies which will have to submit the most detailed reports have yet begun to assess the detailed systems changes which will be required. It seems a classic example of a business imperative falling into the gulch between general management and information systems management. Each believes the other is responsible for initiating and implementing the necessary changes, and as a result nothing has been done. The heaviest burden will fall on the larger companies - exporting or importing more than Pounds 135,000 worth of goods a year - and those trading with several European countries. For companies which have not yet begun to modify their systems, it may be already too late to meet the end-of-year deadline. The reason is that although the software changes might seem slight, they are extensive, affecting the programs responsible for sales order processing, purchase order processing, accounts receivable, accounts payable, fixed assets and inventory. Changes to these core systems cannot be made quickly or easily. Many companies rely on accounting software developed years ago in technologies now obsolete. The design details of these 'legacy' systems often become obscured and programmers are reluctant to make changes because of the risk of crashing the entire system or generating errors in other programs. Modification becomes more complicated when a company is using a number of systems. Only a minority have so-called 'integrated' accounting software which uses common descriptions of data and accounting conventions. Another reason why time is short is the chronic shortage of skilled staff which already inhibits companies' ability to develop new computer applications. There are software packages on the market designed to cope with the new requirements, but companies cannot simply buy their way out of difficulty by installing a package. Software of this kind needs data to process and the only place this can come from is the corporate accounting system. Companies which have yet to prepare for 1993 have three options, other than modifying their existing systems. They can write, or have written, a special piece of software which will accept data from their existing accounting system and turn it into reports acceptable to the Customs authorities. This could cost between Pounds 6,000 and Pounds 80,000. They can buy a cheap and cheerful software package which will generate the appropriate VAT returns. The data will have to be keyed in by hand, however, which will be costly in time and money. They will have to prepare reports manually or pay an agent to do the job for them. VAT reports can be submitted on paper, on half-inch magnetic tape, 3.5 inch diskettes, or via electronic data interchange - a range of options which some firms may find restrictive.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of the Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed exemption provided retroactive and prospective relief from section 406(a)(1) (A) through (D) of the Act and section 4975(c)(1) (A) through (D) of the Code for foreign exchange transactions between a party in interest bank or affiliate thereof and an employee benefit plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commentator urged the Department to expand the final exemption to permit broker-dealers who are registered under the Securities Act of 1934 (1934 Act) and their affiliates to engage in foreign exchange transactions with plans. According to this commentator, the same reasons for granting the exemption to banks apply with equal force to broker-dealers and their affiliates. Broker-dealers act as custodians and provide other services to plans which cause them to be parties in interest as defined in section 3(14) of the Act. In addition, broker-dealers may also participate in foreign exchange transactions. Accordingly, absent the availability of an exemption, many major money market broker-dealers and their affiliates might not be able to deal with plans with respect to foreign exchange transactions. The commentator also asserts that in order for the ``general'' arm's length test contained in the exemption to work effectively, the exemption must include significant participants in the foreign exchange market. Finally, the commentator notes that broker-dealers which are registered under the 1934 Act are subject to extensive regulatory control consisting of a panoply of federal, self-regulatory organization and state regulations and supervisory structures. The Department has considered this comment and determined that it would be appropriate to include broker-dealers which are registered under the 1934 Act and their affiliates within the scope of relief provided by the final class exemption. Accordingly, the final exemption has been modified in this regard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commentator requested that the exemption be expanded to provide relief for individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and Keogh plans which are not employee benefit plans covered by title I of the Act. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department does not believe that a sufficient showing has been made regarding the demand for exemptive relief for non-title I IRAs and Keogh Plans. Therefore, the Department is unable to conclude that the final exemption should be expanded as requested.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 29 CFR 2510.3&hyph;2(d) explains that IRAs described in section 408(a) of the Code will not be considered pension plans subject to title I of ERISA, provided that: (1) no contributions to the plan are made by the employer or employee association; (2) participation is completely voluntary for employees or members; (3) the sole involvement of the employer or employee organization is without endorsement to permit the sponsor to publicize the program, to collect contributions on behalf of the sponsor through payroll deductions or dues checkoffs and to remit them to the sponsor; and (4) the employer or employee organization receives no consideration in the form of cash or otherwise, other than reasonable compensation for services actually rendered in connection with payroll deductions or dues checkoffs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 29 CFR 2510.3&hyph;3(b) explains that for purposes of title I of ERISA, ``employee benefit plan'' shall not include a Keogh Plan under which no employees are covered under the plan. In this regard, 29 CFR 2510.3&hyph;3(c) states that for purposes of the above referenced section: (1) an individual and his or her spouse shall not be deemed to be employees with respect to a trade or business, whether incorporated or unincorporated, which is wholly owned by the individual or by the individual and his or her spouse; and (2) a partner in a partnership and his or her spouse shall not be deemed to be employees with respect to the partnership.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed exemption contained a condition requiring that the bank maintain written policies and procedures regarding the handling of foreign exchange transactions with plans which assure that the person acting for the bank knows that he or she is dealing with a plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commentator expressed concern that requiring the person acting for the bank to know that he or she is dealing with an ERISA plan will require the institution of new procedures at foreign exchange desks which will increase the cost of transactions for ERISA plans. The commentator stated that it treats all client transactions in a uniform manner. Finally, the commentator stated that it does not believe that the condition will achieve beneficial results for plan transactions at its facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

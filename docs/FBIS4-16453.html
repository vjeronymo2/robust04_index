			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>   [Text] Mirnyy (Arkhangelsk region) April 18 TASS -- A  programme for the environmental defence of the Russian north has  been worked out by scientists working with the state strategic  missile testing complex. The programme allows the military to  estimate the damage caused to the environment by missile fuel  and other harmful things, and to decrease the amount of damage  caused to nature along the missiles' flight path.    "600 rocket and rocket-carrier launchings have been made in  the last ten years. That is what forced us to start researching  environmental problems", ITAR-TASS was told by Colonel Viktor  Omelchenko, head of the testing area's computer centre.    The programme was worked out by the testing area's leading  specialists and is a data and reference system which shows which  areas are most subject to damage and the various levels of  pollution. On the basis of such statistics, conclusions may be  drawn and certain steps undertaken. The programme is unique,  since it is concentrated on a concrete area, the environmentally  fragile Russian north.    According to Omelchenko, Russian cooperation with American  military scientists has led to great interest in the latter's  missile-related environmental programme, which has been  thoroughly worked out.    The United States programme's starting theses are  significantly different from the Russian ones. For example, the  flight trajectory of missiles and missile-launchers goes over  the Pacific Ocean. However, the two countries' cooperation in  this sphere is still very helpful.    "The programme which we have created is the first step to  the  development of an environmental monitoring system to keep track  of the situation as it develops", stressed Colonel Omelchenko.</p>

			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROTHENBERG TRYING TO GET BECKENBAUER  </P> <P> Alan Rothenberg, president of the U.S. Soccer Federation, stepped up the  federation's pursuit of Franz Beckenbauer Monday, saying he will offer the West  German coach a job doing "anything and everything."  </P> <P> Rothenberg also dismissed as "silly" a letter sent from six former USSF  officers to soccer's international governing body, FIFA, protesting what they  say was FIFA's interference in the recent USSF elections.  </P> <P> Rothenberg said he will meet with Beckenbauer in Austria next month to discuss  the possibility of the coach working with the USSF. Beckenbauer, however, was  quoted by Agence-France Presse Sunday as saying he will not be coming to the  United States in any soccer capacity for at least two years, if at all.  </P> <P> Rothenberg, who was elected as president last month, said he wants to meet with  Beckenbauer personally. He said he is already planning to meet FIFA officials  in Switzerland early next month and will make a side trip to talk with  Beckenbauer.  </P> <P> Rothenberg said he has had preliminary discussions with Beckenbauer's  representatives and is prepared to offer him virtually any job within the  federation.  </P> <P> Beckenbauer, who coached West Germany to the World Cup title last month, has  been rumored to be taking a position with the USSF.  </P> <P> The coach was quoted by Agence-France Press as saying: "I cannot do anything  else in Germany with my title of world champion. I won't go to the United  States to prepare for the World Cup before 1992."  </P> <P> Rumors have also surfaced that Beckenbauer will soon take a coaching job in  Europe.  </P> <P> Regarding the letter to FIFA, which Rothenberg termed "a rather feeble  protest," little response is expected. According to Stephen Flamhaft, a  Brooklyn attorney retained by the group of former USSF officers, FIFA has yet  to respond to the letter sent Aug. 10 to FIFA's general secretary, Joseph  Blatter.  </P> <P> Flamhaft said Monday that the six former officers represented a much larger  number of USSF members upset by events at the USSF elections Aug. 5 at Orlando,  Fla., which led to the election of Rothenberg.  </P> <P> Flamhaft said that the letter asked FIFA to conduct an inquiry into allegations  that FIFA officials actively campaigned for Rothenberg. He is not optimistic  that FIFA will show any interest in investigating itself.  </P></p>

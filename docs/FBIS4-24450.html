			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Hang Yuan] </F>   [Text] Senior bankers in China have pledged to turn the  national currency, the yuan, into a fully convertible unit in an  effort to reverse an exodus of capital from the country.    Zhou Xiaochuan, Vice-Governor of the central bank, the  People's Bank of China, recently told the nation's bankers that  full convertibility of the yuan had been given top priority by  the leadership as reform reached a critical stage.    But speaking on the same subject, Xu Bin, Deputy Director of  the State Administration of Exchange Control (SAEC), stressed  that full convertibility would be attempted only if the  authorities were convinced it would not cause market disruption.  And Mr Xu hinted that the authorities had no intention of  changing the present exchange rate -- U.S.$1 to 8.7 yuan -- and  would not allow "significant" depreciation of the yuan even  after it became fully convertible.    But Mr Xu warned that the Government faced increasing  difficulties in maintaining a stable foreign exchange market as  China faced a huge foreign trade deficit, double-digit inflation  and high interest rates.    Although Mr Zhou did not give a specific target date for  full  convertibility, he said it was considered an essential step to  reform. "Full convertibility is not the goal of reform, but an  indispensable step in achieving our ultimate goal of reform and  opening (to the outside world)," Mr Zhou said.    "Pledging to turn the yuan into a convertible currency helps  to build up public confidence in our national currency," said Mr  Zhou. "[We also believe] full convertibility would not have a  great impact on our national reserves."    According to Mr Zhou, the Government was now inclined to  adopt a two-step approach to turn the yuan into a fully  convertible currency. The Government would first lift controls  over servicing accounts such as those for trade and investment.  Full convertibility in the marketplace would follow later. The  latest remarks by senior bankers were seen by analysts as  indications that reformist officials were keen to push ahead  with controversial policies before the death of paramount leader  Deng Xiaoping.    Full convertibility of the yuan is also one of the  conditions  China has to fulfil for re-entry to the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade.    According to Vice-Governor Zhou, the Government understands  that the conversion restriction does not help to stop money  leaving the country. On the contrary, the restriction is a  disincentive for China-funded businesses to remit profits home.  He also cited a survey in the United States which showed that  China had suffered a net outflow of capital into the U.S. and  much of the cash was being siphoned out of China through  "suspicious channels".    Quoting sources in Hong Kong, the Vice-Governor said it was  believed a large number of China-funded companies had reinvested  their profits in high-yield businesses in the territory to  escape the foreign exchange controls imposed by the Beijing  Government. He said there was no reason why China should suffer  a net outflow of capital when the country's interest rates and  rate of return on investment were both higher than those offered  in most developed countries.    In 1992, more than U.S.$17 billion (HK$131.2 billion) of  foreign money flowed into China, up 50 per cent on the previous  year. Meanwhile, Mr Xu denied the authorities had intervened in  the markets and claimed the stability in foreign exchange  markets was the result of market forces.    "Not only has the SAEC not tried to support (the 8.7 yuan  exchange rate) by buying in the markets, other departments have  not intervened through administrative methods," he said. "This  is really an exchange rate [set by] the market."    It was the consensus among foreign investors and bankers  that  China was able to maintain the 8.7-yuan exchange rate through  government intervention.</p>

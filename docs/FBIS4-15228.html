			<p>BFN     [Text] Unilateral action taken by Russia aimed at setting  up military bases in Latvia against the will of a sovereign  state run counter to the principles of international law and  obligations -- which had been undertaken by Russia as a member  of the United Nations and a participant of the CSCE -- the  statement of the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry reads.    On 5 April, Russian President Boris Yeltsin signed an edict  according to which approval is given to the proposal by the  Russian Ministry of Defense to set up Russian military bases on  the territories of CIS countries and Latvia for testing new  weapons and military equipment.    Lithuania supports in every possible way Latvia's desire to  have the Russian troops withdrawn from her territory and  declares that only the Republic of Latvia has the right to  decide the military basis of what state can be deployed on her  territory, the statement of the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry  reads.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The newspaper TRABAJADORES published a lengthy  article in today's edition by reporter Carmen R. Alfonso on  migration policy, entitled: "Open or Closed Doors." Following  are some of its most important aspects.    Stating that migration laws are customary, and more than  that, necessary in any contemporary state, she notes that these  laws vary according to political, economic, social, military,  and other interests, and that Cuba is no exception to these  general conditions.    Carmen Alfonso states in her analysis that our case cannot  be  ignored when analyzing the migration issue and its complexity  within the Cuban-U.S. conflict, taking into account that a large  number of Cubans have traditionally migrated to the United  States because of its geographic proximity and economic  development.    In addition to those who travel to other nations for work or  for other official reasons, there are also those who travel for  personal reasons. Among them, we can mention three categories:  those who wish to leave and return; those who definitely want to  reside in another country; and those who request residence  authorization abroad.    At present, temporary leave is authorized for those over 20  years of age, although men up to the age of 26 or 27 years old  who wish to reside abroad must first fulfill their military  obligation. Minors under 18 must be authorized by one of their  parents. It is appropriate to mention that last year, Cuba  authorized temporary leave for 100,000 people, but only 40,000  managed to leave the country because the others had their  requests denied, usually by the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.    There are also conditions for Cubans who already left the  country. Those who left before 1959 must use the consulate of  the country in which they are residing, and those who left after  1959 also have the chance to return to their native country  through various programs devised for that purpose.    However, U.S. Immigration policy toward Cuba has an  essentially political nature, which justifies the exceptionally  privileged treatment of Cuban immigrants, especially those who  violate the laws that are in effect in our country.    Nevertheless, an agreement signed in 1984 provides for the  annual granting of up to 20,000 visas for those who wish to live  in the United States. But the failure of the U.S. to fulfill  this agreement has been notorious. Paradoxically, the  TRABAJADORES article notes, risky, illegal departure is  facilitated without exception or restriction of the number of  immigrants.</p>

			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / MPs unite to urge child agency changes Conservative backbenchers joined opposition MPs in the Commons last night in calling for the Child Support Agency to apply a less rigid formula when setting the level of maintenance payments to be made by absentee fathers. Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, ruled out significant changes in the agency's operations before the next report by the Commons social security committee due in October. He said improvements were already evident after changes introduced by the agency in April. Mr Richard Alexander, MP for Newark, Sir Donald Thompson, MP for Calder Valley, and Mr John Horam, MP for Orpington, were among Tory backbenchers who pressed for changes designed to ensure that the agency operated with greater flexibility. After describing the demands made by the agency on one of his constituents with a net income of Pounds 127 a week, Mr Horam said: 'No wonder he came to me and talked about suicide.' Mr Frank Field, the Labour MP for Birkenhead, who is chairman of the cross-party social security committee, said it had not yet reached a position where it could say that the agency was working successfully and achieving its objectives. He urged Tory MPs to impress on the government that the 'jury was still out', and to be ready to support any changes advocated by the committee. Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, said those dissatisfied with the agency's decisions should have some possibility of securing redress. While reaffirming Labour's backing for the principle that it was the duty of parents to support their children, he said public support for the agency was vanishing at an alarming rate. Mr Lilley underlined his opposition to the introduction of an appeals system which would result in a return to an 'open-ended' discretionary system. A Labour motion calling for an urgent and fundamental review of the child support agency was defeated by a government majority of 38 (311-273).</p>

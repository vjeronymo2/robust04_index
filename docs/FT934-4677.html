			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Survey of International Fund Management (2): From Brady to Beijing - Emerging markets In September Morgan Stanley, the New York-based investment bank, led a tour of American and European institutional investors to China. A subsequent huge surge in Hong Kong share prices, as Morgan Stanley's investment strategists sharply raised their target weightings, symbolised the power of the flows of funds now moving around the globe, with an impact especially on the so-called emerging markets. The key conclusion - according to a subsequent 80-page report, exclamatorily entitled 'China]' - was that 'investing in China's future will be the world's most profitable investment opportunity for the next 10 years'. History may well show that the hype associated with the Morgan Stanley trip marked a temporary peak in the fortunes of the Hong Kong market. By mid-November Morgan Stanley was reducing its weighting again, apparently taking something less than a ten-year view. Investors in emerging markets are seeking high returns to offset the generally high risks, and after a prosperous few years they are confident that the rewards are there. For instance, as Mr John Mullen of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York points out in a recent study, annualised equity returns averaged more than 20 per cent over the years 1976-92 in Argentina, Chile, Mexico, South Korea and Thailand. Developed country returns, in comparison, were in the 14-17 per cent range over the same period. The current emerging markets boom reflects the coincidence of two, maybe three, favourable trends. There has been a general outflow of capital from the US, partly reflecting greater international diversification by pension funds and partly, also, a search for value by mutual fund investors who have embarked on an unprecedented shift towards international bond and equity funds. Second, the developed markets happen to have become relatively unappealing. Economic growth in Japan and Continental Europe is currently zero or even minus something. In many countries, bond interest rates have slipped to levels not seen for many years, and US pension funds are having trouble in reaching their actuarial rate of return targets by investing in conventional US Treasury or corporate bonds. For example, each 1 percentage point fall in bond yields increases the deficit of General Motors' pension plan by Dollars 5bn-Dollars 6bn. The focus of global investors has therefore shifted to developing countries, where economic growth rates are still high - often 6 per cent a year in Latin America and parts of the Far East. Indeed, there is a fashionable theory that the economic momentum of south east Asia is now strong enough - especially as a source of cheap manufactures - to be causing a realignment of the global economy. The emergence of China is a key element in this argument. India and Indonesia, with big populations, also have great potential. If relatively small nations such as South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Thailand could create a significant impact, how much more dramatic will the changes be when the giants of the region really get going? Hence the theories of investment strategists that global equity investors should search for growth in these fast-expanding emerging markets, while the uncompetitive developed world will be troubled by price deflation and economic depression (although developed country bond prices may benefit from low inflation). The third factor that has encouraged investment in emerging markets relates in a rather less specific way to favourable political developments. Many Third World countries have dumped socialism and adopted market-oriented policies much more acceptable to international investors. This trend has not yet done much to encourage flows of capital into Eastern Europe or Africa, where the political obstacles are judged to be too great for the time being. But Latin America has benefited tremendously, and is currently receiving large flows of capital from the US. After the protracted insolvency crisis of the 1980s, most Latin American countries are now regaining their creditworthiness, especially after the Brady-type debt restructurings. For instance, American investors bought Dollars 1.4bn worth of Mexican bonds in 1992 - and stepped that up to Dollars 2bn in the first half of 1993. Bigger sums still are involved in equities - but the political and financial frameworks of many countries remain fragile. So risks remain, but investing in emerging markets is no longer primarily the occupation of pioneers - the kind of lone prospectors who would fly into Bangkok or Santiago, aiming to be the first foreigner investors in town. A global infrastructure is being built, so that today international equity and bond placements are quite frequently made by developing countries. Privatisation issues have featured strongly, and provide the kind of large scale and solid corporate investments that are favoured by mainstream global investors. For example, Telemex raised Dollars 1.2bn in 1991, with a listing on the New York stock exchange, and such placements reached some Dollars 9bn in 1992. Mr Martin Quintin-Archard is managing director of emerging market debt trading at Intercapital Brokers. the London firm. 'We sell Mexican CDs to Danish pension funds,' he says. 'It's a completely global business. We sell Peruvian debt to the Singaporeans.' Nevertheless, once investors move outside a narrow group of large, relatively liquid issues, they still need to tread carefully. Share prices can be volatile, financial reporting may be primitive or even fraudulent. Overseas investors may be confined to less-attractive classes of share capital, or cut out of attractive new issues. The quality of research will also be poor, although some investors see this as an advantage as it implies that emerging markets can be very inefficient, thus offering attractive opportunities if you know what you are doing. Growth, however, now so hard to find in developed markets, is the fundamental attraction.</p>

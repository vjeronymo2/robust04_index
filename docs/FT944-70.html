			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / On The Front Line: Saddam's gamble President Saddam Hussein has bet on war as other addictive gamblers play roulette. He has laid extravagant wagers, borrowed to cover his losses, and then doubled the stakes in a vain effort to recoup. Not for him the pre-dawn remorse, the guilt-laden call to Gamblers Anonymous, and the tearful pledge to repay his distraught family for the grief he has inflicted. Of all the punters in the Middle East, Saddam is the one least likely to kick the habit. The west, backed by Arab governments and UN resolutions, is trying to remove temptation by denying Iraq the cash with which its leader has invested so heavily in arms. The resolve is greatest in Washington and Kuwait, but the voices of China, France and Russia have increasingly been heard arguing that the Iraqi people have suffered too much already, and that Baghdad has to be rewarded for complying with Security Council resolutions. Compliance, however, is a hard concept for Saddam to accept, as are other words which might imply compromise, weakness or defeat. The Iraqi leader's career has been built and sustained through the creation of an aura of unchallengeable strength. When Iraqi troops marched into Iran in 1980 it was glorious revenge for humiliations heaped on Arabs by the Persians over the centuries. When the Iraqi troops were driven out a couple of years later, the war became a no-less-glorious defence of the Arab nation against the Shia Islamic revolution. Ten years later, history repeated itself in Kuwait. A military rout was presented within Iraq as a David-like defiance of the western imperialist Goliath. Saddam's survival continues to baffle western governments, though not the people of Iraq. An obsession with security and British-trained personal bodyguards explains part of it. More important is his reputation for the ruthless elimination of anyone whose loyalty may be in doubt, a total grip on senior military appointments, and the belief among some that the country could fracture into at least three parts. The allies failed to prevent Baghdad reasserting its grip over the rebellious Shia population in the south, and without a protected zone for the Kurds there is no doubt that Saddam's troops would march northwards. The combination of sanctions and military threats is thus limiting Saddam's domestic ambitions. But the Iraqi leader is chaffing at the bit, and it would take a credulous international community to accept at face value his recent recognition of Kuwait's sovereignty and acceptance of the UN-designated border. It is more realistic to look back to October when Iraq moved armour and troops to within striking distance of Kuwait, before withdrawing in the face of a US deployment. The episode served at least two purposes. It reminded the Iraqi people of their leader's ability to tweak the nose of an American president. And it should have reminded everyone else that Saddam is still at the table, and may not be able to resist the challenge of another throw. Dice and leopards do not change their spots.</p>

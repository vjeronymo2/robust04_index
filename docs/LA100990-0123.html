			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE;  </P> <P> CONSTRUCTION WORK KNOCKS OUT PHONES  </P> <P> More than 450 telephones in the northern section of the city were knocked out  of service Monday, apparently after a construction crew severed an underground  phone cable, fire officials said.  </P> <P> Emergency phone service to the Fire and Police departments was also severed for  a short time around 2:20 p.m. until backup systems came on line, officials  said.  </P> <P> "We were back on line as soon as we noticed the interruption in phone service,"  said Jack Stubbs, emergency planner for the city Fire Department. "It was just  a few minutes."  </P> <P> Phone company officials say they believe the accident occurred when a backhoe  operator doing construction work near the intersection of Avenida Presidio and  Calle Neblina severed an underground cable.  </P> <P> "When we got (to the construction site) there was nobody there," said Linda  Bonniksen, a spokeswoman for Pacific Bell. "But it appears as if that is what  happened."  </P> <P> Phone service was expected to be restored by midnight Monday, she said. FRANK  MESSINA  </P></p>

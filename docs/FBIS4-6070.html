			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 17 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu  Hata, a central figure in the current political development in  Japan and a possible successor to Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa, returned to Tokyo on Sunday [17 April] morning from  Marrakech, Morocco.    In Marrakech, he attended a four-day ministerial meeting of  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) member nations  to sign the final agreement of the Uruguay Round of multilateral  trade talks.    Hata, a front-runner to succeed the outgoing prime minister,  hinted at a possible tie-up with former Foreign Minister Michio  Watanabe of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), who has  expressed his readiness to run for the upcoming Diet vote for  the premiership.    Watanabe, head of the LDP's third largest faction, also has  disclosed his readiness to form a new alliance with Shinseito  [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito [Clean Government Party], the  two key parties in the ruling coalition.    Hata told reporters at Haneda Airport, "I would like to  respect his determination. He is fit to be a leader."    Hata said, "I have never said whether or not I strengthened  my resolution," when asked by reporters about the possibility of  his candidacy for the next premiership. He also opposed a  speed-before-quality Diet election for the next premier, urging  sufficient discussion and preparation.</p>

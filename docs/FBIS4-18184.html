			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Silvio Berlusconi, leader of the Forza </F> Italia party by correspondent Bruno Vespa at Berlusconi's home  in Rome on 29 March; from the "Beyond Words" election program --  recorded]    [Excerpts] [Vespa] Maybe Umberto Bossi is dragging his  feet. On the contrary, Silvio Berlusconi seems to agree  completely with Gianfranco Fini. We have just been to his house  in Rome, near Piazza Navona, where he gave us this exclusive  interview:    Your alliance came out of these elections well. Do you think  you will be able to give this country a government soon?    [Berlusconi] I hope so, because voters gave a very clear  indication. I think that for the first time Italians were able  to choose between two clear proposals. The first, the one on  the freedom and good government alliance, is a liberal,  free-market proposal. There is great stress on the economy, on  the need to relaunch the country, to reduce unemployment, and to  reduce state spending. The other, the left's proposal, called  for state intervention [in the economy]. But at least they [the  left] had a clear program. This had never happened before. I  think that this first happened thanks to Forza Italia. For the  first time since 1948 a political force has come forward saying  clearly what its intentions are and presenting a clear and  wide-ranging program. The other forces responded to that and I  think that, for the first time, Italians could choose between  two forces. One won. I think that the winner received a clear  indication that it should give the country a government. I hope  we will be able to do so.    [Vespa] If we finished the interview here, viewers would go  to sleep convinced that there will be a government tomorrow.  Instead, you have already started arguing. Once again Bossi  has said, as he said during the election campaign: No, the  prime minister must be a League candidate. Why is he out to get  you? I have asked you this question before and I will ask it  again.    [Berlusconi] I must correct you. It is not true that we have  already started to argue. Bossi is following the same line he  followed during the election campaign. He voices his doubts and  marks his territory. I think that this is the way he acts in  politics. I think that political life should change, that when  one strikes a deal one should keep his word, that one should  speak clearly, and that one should not become a theorist of  double-crossing strategies. But I hope that beyond all that,  Bossi is also aware of the promise we all together made to the  country. I am sure that many of the candidates indicated by the  League are aware of that.    [Vespa] Is it the usual horse-trading among allies when a  government has to be formed?    [Berlusconi] I cannot say that it is usual, as it is the  first time I have tried. I do not want to talk about a usual  thing because it clashes with my style. I think that we will  have to sit around a table very soon with a precise program and  that we will have to discuss that program. All I did today was  work on the program I will submit to my allies. I held talks  with many of these allies. I am looking forward to meeting  Bossi and the people of the League.    [Vespa] During the campaign there was talk of forming a  government by cutting off the wings and of leaving Gianfranco  Fini out.    [Berlusconi] I think voters showed there is a  liberal-democratic bloc and the whole bloc must be in the  government.    [Vespa] Do you intend broadening it? Are you looking toward  the center or do you think you can make it by yourself? I would  like to remind you that you do not have an absolute majority in  the Senate.    [Berlusconi] Yes, but it is a gap that can easily be filled  with other forces.    [Vespa] Which ones?    [Berlusconi] There are senators from the Trentino Alto-Adige  region, of the Sud-Tiroler Volkspartei. There are also the life  senators. I do not think we will have any problem in finding  extra votes in the Senate. I really do not think it is going to  be difficult. As far as I am concerned -- as I have always said  and as I told Mario Segni and Mino Martinazzoli before the  elections -- since our programs are not so far apart, I am  convinced that it will be possible to work together.    [Vespa] As we are talking about programs, Achille Occhetto  told us a short while ago that he hopes Berlusconi will keep the  promises made to voters. This is what voters want as well, I  must say.    [Berlusconi] This is what Berlusconi wants, more than anyone  else, if I may say so.    [Vespa] You somehat exaggerated. You said: One million new  jobs.    [Berlusconi] I did not exaggerate. I am convinced that it  is feasible. Let us send a reassuring message to Mr. Occhetto,  so that he is left with no doubts. I met the people in charge  of coordination and program this morning, and this morning we  assigned the tasks to transform the various points in the  program into bills. We did not do that before because we were  superstitious. But as of today, we have started to work.  [passage omitted] We want to be ready to have these points in  the program transformed into bills immediately after the  chambers start working. As for employment, I am absolutely  certain that...[pauses] This morning I spoke...[pauses] I  spoke so much today. I kept in touch with people from the  business community, with politicians and journalists. It was a  big day indeed. I spoke to many industrialist friends,  industrialists from large concerns and with those from medium  and small businesses. [passage omitted] They are all eager to  receive a precise signal they can trust. They want to be  stimulated by the government. I think that we have very clear  ideas about what measures are needed to give that signal. These  will be the first steps taken by the government. You will see  that what I announced will be realized. All Italians will be  able to see. We are poised for a recovery and new jobs. We  will also save the jobs that today are considered to be under  threat. If we have the possibility to govern, if the opposition  is with us in desiring good for our country, then I think that  we will be able to do a lot. We will be able to go in an  absolutely positive direction, in the direction of economic  welfare.    [Vespa] Did not any of these people with whom you talked  tell  you: Mr. Berlusconi, you have too many interests of your own to  be a steady prime minister.    [Berlusconi] They do not tell me these things directly.    [Vespa] Second hand information maybe?    [Berlusconi] I have just seen a television interview of a  politician who was saying precisely that. I think that I made  it clear that I have resigned from all the managing positions in  my group.    [Vespa] You are still the owner though.    [Berlusconi] Yes, but I feel very detached from concrete  problems. I have heard that some people have said that if I  want to be prime minister, I must sell my companies. Let them  come forward. If there is someone willing to buy them from me, I  have nothing against it. It is a joke but it may well become  true, if it were possible. But I want to assure all those who  voted for me and also those who are worried at the thought of  our future government -- if we have the responsibility of  forming a government -- that as far as I am concerned, I will  work in everyone's interest. I will certainly work more in  everyone's interest than in the interest of those who are on our  side. I will remember that a government must be everyone's  government. My personal interests will be left behind, they  will eventually be forgotten, I think.    [Vespa] Let us carry on with your joke. If someone came to  you with the money and said can you sell me a television  channel? What would you say then?    [Berlusconi] Here it is, it is ready. Of course if there was  no expropriation, no confiscation, and if the price is right, if  it reflected the true value of something that had been built  with blood, sweat, and tears . [passage omitted]    [Vespa] Do you have any ideas about who the ministers will  be.    [Berlusconi] Yes, of course. I do not think that this is the  right time to give names. The names must be found with the  agreement of all the allies. But I think that more than the  names of ministers, what is important is the points of the  program on which all the allies will find agreement. I believe  this will happen very soon. I am about to start work on that.    [Vespa] Will the ministers be technocrats or politicians?    [Berlusconi] A long-lasting government, as I think the next  one will be, must be a government formed by responsible people,  with a political responsibility given to them by the voters.  This does not mean that there will not be any experts, they  will probably be advisers. They may also have government  responsibilities. But this must be a political government  because this is what the voters clearly asked for.    [Vespa] Fini said that it seems acceptable to him to discuss  with the opposition who the next speakers in the chambers will  be. Do you agree?    [Berlusconi] I have not spoken about this with him. I cannot  rule out the possibility of electing very experienced  institutional figures. These are posts that require a lot of  experience. But we did not discuss that detail. I think that  the result indicates that there is a majority that forms the  government and a minority that must be the opposition. I  personally think that the people responsible for the various  institutions must be chosen from the people within the ranks of  the majority.    [Vespa] If you realized that your bid to be prime minister  is  a hindrance to forming a government, would you step aside?    [Berlusconi] I would step aside immediately if the  alternative solution proposed were the better solution.    [Vespa] Thanks Mr. Berlusconi.    [Berlusconi] Thank you.</p>

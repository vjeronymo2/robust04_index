			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa pact goes for output management THE NEW International Cocoa Agreement, adopted late on Friday after more than a year of negotiations, is the first United Nations commodity pact to make production management its cornerstone. Instead of focusing on short-term price stabilisation, through buffer stock operations or export quotas, the accord aims to shore up prices in the long term by limiting supply and promoting consumption. Unlike producer cartels such as the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the cocoa accord brings consumer countries on to the production management committee, which will set the parameters for and monitor compliance with supply targets. However, producers alone will be responsible for drawing up and implementing supply curbs. Mr Kouame N'Guessan, spokesman for the producers, said on Friday that producers finally had their destiny within their hands. All prices were obtainable provided producers made the necessary sacrifices and showed discipline. Mr Alain Gauze, commodities minister for the Ivory Coast, pledged his country's support for a well-co-ordinated production policy to raise prices. The Ivory Coast, which accounts for a third of total world exports, has already taken steps in the past two years to keep cocoa off the market but stocks of an estimated 1.4m tonnes have continued to depress prices. The production committee will fix 'indicative figures for annual levels of global production necessary to achieve and maintain equilibrium' in the cocoa market, in the light of forecasts for world production and consumption, the agreement says. The accord also establishes a consumption committee to promote cocoa use and calls on importing members to 'remove or reduce substantially' domestic taxes and import tariffs that deter consumption. Mr N'Guessan warned on Friday that a proposed harmonisation of EC standards on cocoa butter substitutes in production of chocolate could, in some circumstances, cut cocoa use in the community by some 200,000 tonnes a year. This would run counter to the efforts of producing countries to solve the problem of oversupply, he said. The new accord will come into force when ratified by at least five exporting countries accounting for at least 80 per cent of total exports and by importing countries representing at least 60 per cent of total imports. The current 1986 agreement is due to expire at the end of September. Its 40 members account for three-quarters of world production and consumption. Among producers, Malaysia, responsible for 10 per cent of world production, and Indonesia are not members, nor is the biggest consumer, the US, which accounts for a quarter of world imports. All three countries took part in the Geneva negotiations.</p>

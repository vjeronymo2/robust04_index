Program Efficiencies and Improvement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The existing systems for health care delivery and financing have undergone, and are continuing to undergo, changes due to new technology, legislation, regulation, and market forces. Major payers for health care are continually studying the feasibility of new approaches to improving the management of care, the delivery of care, and financing. Therefore, HCFA invites applications that focus on tools to assist in the goal of improved management of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term management is used in a broad sense. These could be tools that are directed toward providers who furnish services or products to Medicare beneficiaries or Medicaid recipients, organizations that handle the financing of care, organizations that oversee the quality of services and products, or the beneficiaries and recipients themselves, and State and local organizations that deal primarily with Medicare and Medicaid populations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFA will consider any innovative idea that appears to have the potential for improving the programs for any of the several parties involved, and that has a potential for sale in the normal or commercial market. An example of an innovative idea is the development of improved computer- based case management systems for community care services. Case management programs are commonly being used to coordinate community-based care for frail elderly and other populations under Medicaid and other programs. Automated systems use client eligibility and assessment information to assist case management agencies in preparing appropriate plans of care based on the client's condition and select service providers. These systems would also interface with service approval or financial or billing systems to improve the cost-efficiency of case management programs. Proposed systems should complement or integrate existing mandated HCFA instruments (particularly functional assessment tools, minimum data sets, discharge planning, etc.). Redundant instruments will not be considered for funding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E.

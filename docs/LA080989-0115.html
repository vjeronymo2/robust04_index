			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> UTC Takes Unit Off Market: United Technologies Corp., Hartford, Conn., has  taken its Norden Systems subsidiary off the market after more than a year of  looking for a buyer willing to pay what UTC thought the radar-systems maker was  worth, according to a letter to employees made public. UTC announced in April,  1988, that it planned to sell Norden because it felt that Norden didn't fit  into its overall plans and that it would fare better as part of a large defense  electronics company. Norden, a $400-million-a-year company, makes radar systems  for aircraft and ships. It also has a contract to make radar systems for the  Federal Aviation Administration.  </P></p>

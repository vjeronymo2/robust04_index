			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> S.F. MAY ERECT STATUE REPLICA  </P> <P> The San Francisco Board of Supervisors has endorsed a proposal to erect a  Chinatown replica of the Goddess of Democracy statue, toppled by tanks during  the bloody confrontation in Beijing's Tian An Men Square. A coalition of  Chinese groups in the San Francisco Bay Area is seeking to raise up to $250,000  to build the 30-foot sculpture, which still requires approval by the Parks and  Recreation Commission and the Arts Commission. "It would be temporary," said  Thomas Marsh, a sculptor promoting the project. "It would be given to the  Chinese when they're ready to accept it."  </P></p>

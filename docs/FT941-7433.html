			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie rallies but closes below the day's best - Market Report The London stock market tried hard to rally yesterday as it digested Tuesday's comments on economic and interest rate prospects from both sides of the Atlantic. But the FT-SE 100 Index failed to sustain a brief recovery to the important 3,350 mark. Bond markets continued to set the pace, and UK equities were unsettled at the close when US Federal bonds, and Wall Street, displayed an easier trend. The final reading showed the FT-SE 100 at 3,341.9 for a gain of 8.2. Investors remained torn between the favourable views on the domestic economy expressed by the UK government's independent advisory panel - the Wise Men - and the discouragement of short-term interest rate optimism from both the panel and from Mr Alan Greenspan, US Federal Reserve chairman. In addition, the equity market had to face the implications of the auction of Pounds 2.5bn of UK government securities, and trading results from a number of leading companies, which produced several sharply diverging price movements. The Footsie, helped by Wall Street's firm response overnight to Mr Greenspan's congressional testimony, and led by London's stock index futures market, advanced 14.7 to 3,348.4 in early trading. Gilt-edged stocks moved erratically as the auction unwound and the US bond market braced itself for the outcome of the auction of two-year Federal notes in New York. A rally in bonds later carried the Footsie briefly to 3,355, a net rise of 21 points and a brief recapture of an important benchmark for the stock market. The financial sectors suffered a further setback after National Westminster Bank disclosed a profits and dividend gain which fell far short of market expectations. Results from Commercial Union were overshadowed by the uncertainty cast over the insurance sector in the previous session when Guardian Royal Exchange warned of increasing competition. Shares in British Aerospace improved, however, following the trading statement, which showed heavy provisions in the turbo divisions. Today brings a list of trading reports from leading UK companies, including British Gas, Shell Transport and ICI. Some analysts believe that, following comments from the Wise Men, the UK stock market may now turn away from the interest rate factors which have been influencing shares, and look for signs from corporate profits statements that economic recovery is showing through in profit and loss accounts. An indication of recovering confidence among investors was shown by the increase in Seaq trading volume to 822.4m shares from the 625.1m of the previous session. Second line issues played a significant role, making up around 60 per cent of the total, and the FT-SE Mid 250 Index put on 6 points at 3,974.9. Equity trading volume has been falling away since the Footsie began to give ground, but there was a sharp recovery on Tuesday when retail, or genuine customer, business in UK shares jumped to Pounds 1.6bn, a return to the best levels of the past 12 months. There were indications yesterday that analysts of the London market, while remaining optimistic overall, were reconsidering their year-end targets in the wake of the discouragement given to base rate optimism this week. Some believe that European bond markets may be able to uncouple from trends in the US fixed interest sector.</p>

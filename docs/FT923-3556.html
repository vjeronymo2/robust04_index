			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Day of judgment for Thailand's generals: The winners in Sunday's general election will inherit a divided society and a series of economic problems Devils and angels are evenly matched in the battle for Thailand's soul, according to the latest opinion polls. In the language of Bangkok liberals, the 'devil parties' competing in Sunday's general election are those which formed a coalition government after the previous poll in March, chose the army chief as prime minister and supported the military when troops killed 50 pro-democracy protesters in the capital in May. The 'angel parties' backed the demonstrators and succeeded in forcing the resignation of General Suchinda Kraprayoon from the premiership. Their victory led to the dissolution of parliament and this weekend's election. Pollsters and analysts, grappling with the complexities of an election contested by 12 parties, have made conflicting predictions about the outcome. But all agree that the next Thai government will again be a fragile coalition between parties on both sides of the political divide. Whoever emerges as the new prime minister will need to attempt to heal the wounds inflicted on society by the May violence. They will also need to redress the planning failures which have left Thailand and its fast-growing economy with an inadequate education system, a poor transport infrastructure and a deteriorating environment. If the 'devils' do well on Sunday the most likely candidate for prime minister is Mr Chatichai Choonhavan, a former premier who now leads a party called Chart Pattana (National Development). Mr Chatichai presided over a notoriously corrupt administration until he was overthrown by Gen Suchinda in the February coup. He is therefore opposed by foreign businessmen and by the increasingly liberal and middle-class population of Bangkok. Among the so-called angels, there are three probable candidates for the premiership: Mr Chamlong Srimuang, leader of Palang Dharma (Moral Force); Mr Chuan Leekpai, who heads the Democrat Party; and Mr Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, leader of the New Aspiration Party. Their chances are thought to have improved since the March election, which left them with insufficient seats to form a government. Distrust of the military and weariness of corruption seem to be spreading to provincial towns from the liberal strongholds in Bangkok and southern Thailand. However, the loose alliance of anti-military parties forged during the May crisis has been weakened by rivalry between Palang Dharma and the Democrats. Mr Chamlong, an anti-corruption campaigner and devout Buddhist, is accused by some Democrats of leading the Bangkok marchers to their deaths in May in pursuit of his own political ambitions. Mr Chuan is criticised by members of Palang Dharma for failing to take bold action outside the confines of parliament at the crucial time. Mr Chavalit has difficulty articulating clear policies and his party's reputation has been damaged by allegations of vote-buying. But despite the talk of heaven and hell, the policies of the parties on each side of the political divide are often indistinguishable. Most MPs are elected on the basis of their personal influence rather than their party affiliation. With Mr Chamlong as prime minister, there would certainly be a drive against corruption. He has also promised to stamp out the country's vice trade by enforcing existing laws against prostitution. Three of the four leading contenders for the premiership are retired generals - Messrs Chatichai, Chamlong and Chavalit - a useful experience for a prime minister wanting to keep the military, and its civilian critics, under control. The armed forces themselves, which have launched or attempted to launch 18 coups d'etats in the past 60 years, are keeping a low political profile, although some of the generals are openly resentful of attempts to curb their power since May. They have been stripped of many of their business sinecures by the interim government of Mr Anand Panyarachun. Only this week the Anand administration took control of Thai Airways International, the partially privatised national airline, from the air chief marshals who long dominated the board and regarded the company as their private fiefdom. The economy has survived this year's political turmoil with less damage than originally feared, and the latest official estimates suggest that real gross domestic product will rise by slightly more than last year's 7.5 per cent. Businessmen and economists, however, are concerned by the failure of successive governments to implement long-term plans to improve education and infrastructure. Professor Ammar Siamwalla, president of the Thailand Development Research Institute, the country's leading think-tank, has been analysing the evolution of this problem. He told a pre-election seminar that Japan's experience showed a country could 'have sustained economic growth continuing on with a relatively backward political system'. Thailand's economy, he said, had grown rapidly despite corruption because a system was in place which allowed professionals to control macro-economic policy while elected politicians ran ministries - such as transport and telecommunications - where there were opportunities for graft. But there were two dangers in this system, Prof Ammar said. First, the corruption could become 'too indecent', as it did when Mr Chatichai was prime minister, and second, rapid economic growth had created a need for long-term policy-making, which Thailand lacks. One of the results of this failure is an educational system which is inferior to those of Thailand's regional competitors and which is failing to produce enough of the skilled workers and managers needed to maintain the country's rapid development. Even by the year 2000 three-quarters of the workforce will have only primary education or less. Economic reform was likewise often neglected until the arrival of Mr Anand, a businessman. During his two short terms as unelected prime minister after the 1991 coup, he launched a series of reforms, including trade liberalisation, a value-added tax and the establishment of a Securities and Exchange Commission. This week all four prime ministerial hopefuls said they would invite professionals rather than elected politicians to run important economic portfolios in a new government. There is also broad consensus that Mr Anand's vigorous programme of economic reforms should be pursued. In one of his final speeches before retiring from politics - for the second and, he hopes, the last time - Mr Anand singled out education, the environment and the need to strengthen political institutions as the priorities for future governments. Whoever wins - and the outcome is likely to depend on delicate negotiations about forming a coalition - resolving these problems will require angelic temperament and devilish cunning.</p>

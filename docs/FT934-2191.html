			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Public finance must lure private funding to transport network Sir, As a US market leader in insuring municipal bonds, we would endorse the comments made in your editorial, 'A mega-bond for London' (November 29), that the issue of bonds secured by future revenue streams could be the answer to the capital's transport infrastructure problems. However, our experience suggests government should recognise that, in most cases, public finance up front would be required to attract private investors. Bond finance could come in after one to three years of operation when a track record of revenue streams and a credit rating for the issuing body had been established. A number of 'live' projects is required to develop a senior bond market for long-term debt. Therefore, the chancellor's budget announcements on development of private finance initiatives are a welcome step, although a firm foundation for the ground-rules needs to be established.

I am delighted to  send New Year's greetings to you, although I regret it must be  over the radio rather than in person.    I commend you for all you have achieved through your hard  work in the face of all manner of hardships in your adoptive  lands, and for always having been concerned for your home  country.    Fellow Koreans abroad,    Last year was a very important year for the future of Korea.  The era of stagnation and frustration gave way to one of  dynamism and hope. It was the first year of the New Korea being  forged through change and reform. The deep-seated legacy of  misconduct and corruption that was rampant in the past several  decades is being weeded out, injecting fresh air into our  society. Korea is becoming a healthy land in which those who  work hard and honestly can live well. These changes have  greatly elevated our international stature.    Many say that the Asia-Pacific region will continue to be  the  most dynamic center of world growth. I am absolutely sure that  the New Korea we are building will play a leading role in the  Asia- Pacific age which is certain to emerge in the 21st  century. Such a New Korea, with its enhanced international  status, will benefit all the 70 million Korean people at home  and around the world. It will be a source of encouragement and  a spiritual haven for overseas Koreans in particular.    Overseas Koreans,    I know well that you have experienced and still are  experiencing many difficulties in getting adjusted to and  integrated into your adoptive societies. I am confident,  however, that just as our people have triumphed over numerous  trials and tribulations throughout history, you will never  abandon yourselves to despair but will eventually overcome  adversity. I sincerely hope that you will achieve not only  economic security but also actively contribute to your  communities. In that way, you will become respected citizens of  your adoptive countries and demonstrate the excellent national  traits of the Korean people to the world.    I always keep in mind the fact that your, the overseas  Koreans, are an invaluable asset for Korea. I am making every  possible effort for your interests. In particular, I am working  hard to improve our immigration and other pertinent laws and  regulations so that your will not suffer any trouble and  inconvenience in visiting or dealing with your homeland.    When your home country advances, your own status will rise  also. Likewise, your success is a source of pride for our people.    My fellow Koreans overseas,    Our people have a long-cherished goal which we cannot forget  even while sleeping: The peaceful unification of the divided  Korea. A unified Korea would certainly be able to play a key  global role. To that end, North Korea must clear up doubts and  suspicions about its nuclear intentions. I am doing my best to  persuade the North, with a sense of kinship and patience, to  join in the new world order geared to peace, prosperity and  freedom.    Overseas Koreans,    The world is now entering an age of fierce economic war,  replacing the past ideological war. If we do not work hard  enough, we will skid into the backwaters of history. We must  strive for a second national foundation and a second liberation.  Looking ahead into the future, we must be determined to succeed  in reforming all spheres of national life -- political,  economic, civic and all others -- so that your home country will  have become advanced by all measures, including the extent of  internationalization.    Please always remember that you are the pioneers of Korea's  internationalization and are in a unique position to aid and  guide our efforts to build a unified and prosperous New Korea.  Let us pool our strength to construct a great and advanced  nation so that our posterity can be proud of being born Korea.    In greeting 1994, I wish you and your families good health,  happiness and prosperity.    Thank you.</p>

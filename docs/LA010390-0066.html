			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NEW YORK;  </P> <P> PIPELINE RUPTURE SPILLS OIL INTO WATER  </P> <P> A ruptured Exxon pipeline spilled 5,000 to 10,000 gallons of home heating oil  into the Arthur Kill separating New Jersey and Staten Island, forcing cleanup  of more than a mile of the busy commercial waterway, the Coast Guard said.  </P> <P> Shipping was not impeded despite a safety zone set up in the Goethals Bridge  area so that a local contractor could contain the worst concentration of the  oil slick, the Coast Guard said. Exxon officials said the spill could be  cleaned within two days. It had not yet been determined whether the oil caused  environmental damage, officials said.  </P></p>

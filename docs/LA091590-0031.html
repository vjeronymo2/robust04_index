			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEAN TO MACLAINE  </P> <P> I have never liked the term mean-spirited, mostly because I did not quite  understand it.  </P> <P> However, thanks to Don Shirley's Aug. 30 review of Shirley MacLaine's "Out  There Tonight," I do now.  </P> <P> Most of his criticism is leveled at the fact that a great deal of the show is  repetitive of previous shows. Since when is this a sin? Why not repeat proven  material?  </P> <P> Also, what about those of us who have not seen MacLaine previously? Are we to  be discouraged because Don Shirley has?  </P> <P> RICHARD GENOVESE  </P> <P> Toluca Lake  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSPECTIVE ON THE PERSIAN GULF;  </P> <P> READINESS STILL CARRIES ITS RISKS;  </P> <P> A GREAT HIDDEN DANGER IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT WE MAY BE ASKING TOO MUCH OF THE  SYSTEMS WE HAVE CREATED.  </P> <P> In many spheres of life, but particularly in the military, we're building  organizations that are so technologically advanced that errors can lead to  catastrophic consequences.  </P> <P> The American people will probably respond positively to successful military  action in the Middle East. It appears equally likely that they will respond  negatively if something unpredictable happens -- allied ships or planes  shooting at each other, hitting each other or unintentionally involving a  noncombatant, or worse.  </P> <P> Does the American military have the management capacity to ensure that such a  catastrophe does not happen? Is anyone really in charge? The predictable  challenges of operating such complex systems should be considered as important  as the unpredictable challenges of war.  </P> <P> U.S. policy seems to be one in which American forces are positioned with allies  to compel the Iraqi government to withdraw from Kuwait. Simple enough? Not so.  Let us just concern ourselves with what that requires from the Navy (forget the  Army and Air Force units in Saudi Arabia for the time being).  </P> <P> In the restricted waters around the Straits of Hormuz (at the entrance to the  Persian Gulf), we have the aircraft carrier Independence and its attendant  support ships. The Saratoga is in the eastern Mediterranean. The Eisenhower, a  nuclear-powered ship with more staying power than the Independence or Saratoga,  is in the Red Sea.  </P> <P> The sheer awesomeness of such ships suggests some of the management problems  each carrier battle group faces. Ship's company and the air wing of each  carrier is composed of about 5,500 men. Each aircraft carrier has approximately  85 to 90 planes of seven different types, each with different capabilities and  functions. Nuclear carriers can operate for about 13 years without refueling,  but aviation fuel must be replenished at least once a week. About 200,000  gallons of jet fuel are required for a normal strike operation 500 miles from  the ship.  </P> <P> Enter the Kennedy and its support ships. While not as large as the Eisenhower,  this carrier is bigger than the Saratoga or Independence. But like the Saratoga  and Independence, the Kennedy is conventionally fueled.  </P> <P> We now have four battle groups (carriers and their escorts), bringing the  number of ships under U.S. control to about approximately 40 and the number of  sea-based aircraft aboard the carriers alone to about 345. This is in addition  to other Navy ships and aircraft on station or under way. To keep the men  aboard each carrier and the hundreds more aboard the escort ships fed and  moving, stores and fuel must be replaced frequently. That is a complicated  management operation, too. Replenishing requires that the carrier and its  replenishment ship travel "abeam" at about 12 knots, a situation fraught with  vulnerability and the threat of potential collision (the U.S. Navy does many  at-sea replenishments every day without incident). Replenishing other ships is  associated with similar challenges.  </P> <P> Enter the British and the French navies. We often practice with the British.  And those practices (and our own individual practices) uncover numerous  problems. Some, but not all, of these problems are solved in exercises. Now  enter the Soviet Navy. Readiness in the Soviet fleet is considerably different  from readiness in our own. Their organization is structured differently  (including political officers aboard ships). The Soviets sacrifice operations  at sea for material readiness. They go for low wear-and-tear and close  proximity to supporting bases. They also rely less on training than we do.  </P> <P> Managing this geographically dispersed enterprise seems challenging enough.  Managing a situation in which the average age of the American crews is about  20, and their turnover rate is just 44 months, seems impossible. One of the  great hidden dangers of this entire enterprise lies in the possibility that we  may simply be asking too much of the systems we have created.  </P> <P> The government and people of the United States demand quality operations from  our Navy. All in all, we've provided fair resources for obtaining "readiness."  But because of resource constraints, the Navy usually practices joint  activities with two and sometimes three battle groups, rarely practices with  four, almost never practices with numerous battle groups and our allies, and  certainly never practices with the Soviets.  </P> <P> As a society, we place large and risky demands on complex military systems and  expect them not to fail. But when we operate them overtime at their limits, we  increase the likelihood of failure. When we introduce untested challenges, we  further increase the risk. In actual combat, some failures are virtually  guaranteed. How will this risk-averse society react to that?  </P></p>

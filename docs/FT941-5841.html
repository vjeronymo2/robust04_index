			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Technology: Profs start IT group British university academics in the information technology field are planning a new organisation to act as a source of knowledge and experience to help society deal with the problems of growing computerisation. It intends to provide a public platform for IT professionals and to offer advice to government on issues with an IT content. An example could be the passage of laws which would require extensive IT support, such as tax changes. The 40 or so academics argue that existing bodies such as the British Computer Society and the Science and Engineering Research Council are overly preoccupied with computer science and technology and do not properly address business or social issues. Among the leaders of the new group, which has yet to be named, are Robert Galliers of Warwick University and Frank Land of the London School of Economics. The intention is that the organisation will eventually become the UK member of a planned international network, the Association for Information Systems. The formation of the new body is a response to a perception that too much attention is paid by Parliament and Whitehall to computer technology and not enough to the uses of IT in business. 'Our concern is for the design and development of systems which support business needs and in which there is considerable human input. Technology is only one part of such a system,' says Land. Galliers says the new group would have three principal functions: to weld together members of a fragmented profession, to help inform policy at national level and to advise on ways of avoiding computer failures. 'At present, there is the frustration of seeing disasters waiting to happen. The knowledge to solve these problems already exists,' he says.</p>

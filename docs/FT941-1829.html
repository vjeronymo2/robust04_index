			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Prudential concerns Prudential, the UK's biggest general insurer was the market's second heaviest-traded stock with more than 12m shares changing hands after better than expected preliminary results. Prudential shares touched 343p immediately the figures were published but subsequently closed 2 1/2 off at 331 1/2 p. Mr Trevor May, insurance analyst at BZW, increased his current year forecast for Prudential from Pounds 565m to Pounds 650 after the results, but said sentiment in the market remained affected by worries about pension transfers. Marketmakers said Prudential shares were still affected by the sale early last month of a near 2.5 per cent stake in the company, some 46m shares, at 350p a share. Food retailer Argyll saw huge options turnover - 4,530 contracts, equivalent to 4.5m shares - encouraging speculation that a bid may be in the offing. KKR, the US leveraged buy-out specialist, was one name being rumoured as taking a keen interest in the UK group, whose shares have been strong performers recently. Argyll shares retreated 3 to 256p in a generally weak food retail sector as investors were reminded of the industry's problems following results from Iceland. Continuing margin pressure and sales growth decline were worse than the market had been expecting and the shares retreated 4 to 153p. Turnover in aero-engines group Rolls-Royce rose to 16.2m, with buyers encouraged by an upbeat presentation to institutions on Monday. Hoare Govett, the group's broker, was said to have had a big buyer, and US investment bank Lehman Brothers was also reported to have been a keen purchaser early in the session. The shares, up initially closed 2 1/2 off at 189 1/2 p. Stocks with a substantial exposure to Hong Kong responded to the big rally on that market overnight, with HSBC jumping 23 to 783p. There was an element of unease surrounding NatWest's acquisition of Citizens First, the US bank, for Dollars 500m. NatWest shares slipped 8 to 464p on heavy turnover of 10m shares. Sun Alliance slipped 4 to 325p ahead of tomorrow's preliminary results which are expected to reveal profits recovering strongly to around the Pounds 175m-Pounds 190m mark, against last year's Pounds 129m loss. Water stocks were the best performers in a generally strong utilities sector following a buy recommendation from BZW. The broker's utilities team was said to have pinpointed dividend potential in the sector, and highlighted the attractions of Anglian, 510p, North West, 543p and Severn Trent, 572p, all of which rose 8 on the day. The power generators also moved ahead strongly, with PowerGen driven by a Kleinwort Benson buy note. The shares put on 5 to 565p. Oil shares responded to the latest rise in crude oil prices, to above the Dollars 14 a barrel level ahead of Friday's Opec meeting in Geneva. Marketmakers were said to have moved quickly to fill in their short trading position in the various stocks, driving BP up 6 1/2 to 377 1/2. Clyde Petroleum slipped 2 1/2 to 34p following results described as disappointing by some analysts. However, Hoare Govett, Clyde's broker, said the shares were 'obviously oversold compared with their peers.' Lasmo dipped late to close 3 off at 128p with the market braced for a possible cut in the dividend and big underlying losses. News that metals group Johnson Matthey had signed a collaboration deal with Canada's Ballard Power Systems boosted the stock and the shares put on 8 to 590p. Weak bond markets continued to undermine property stocks, with Panmure Gordon taking a more cautious view on the sector. Land Securities fell 6 to 680p, MEPC 6 to 478p and Slough Estates 10 to 252p. Packaging group RPC was heavily traded after agency broker Charterhouse Tilney crossed just over 4m shares, equivalent to 6 per cent of the company. Dealers said the trade was priced at 162p and the shares closed 3 lower at that level. Trinity International the newspaper and packaging group, improved 3 to 458p on increased profits. SG Warburg raised its 1994 forecast by Pounds 0.5m to Pounds 23m. Unilever was said to have benefited from switch advice out of the NV shares from NatWest Securities.</p>

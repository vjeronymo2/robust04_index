			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE CHANGES HIS MIND, ORDERS TRIAL FOR MORTICIAN  </P> <P> A Ventura County Superior Court judge ruled Thursday that the murder case  against David Wayne Sconce could go forward, flip-flopping from a tentative  decision last week to dismiss the case.  </P> <P> Sconce, a 34-year-old Pasadena crematory operator, is accused of using oleander  to poison Timothy Waters, 24, a rival Burbank mortician who died in 1985 after  becoming seriously ill at his parents' home in Camarillo.  </P> <P> Roger Diamond, Sconce's lawyer, has argued that the case should be handled by  deputies who are overseen by the district attorney in the county where the  trial would take place.  </P> <P> Judge Frederick A. Jones tentatively decided last week to throw out the case on  the grounds that Sconce was being denied due process of the law because his  case was being handled by prosecutors from Los Angeles County instead of  Ventura County.  </P> <P> In last week's tentative decision, Jones said it appeared that Dist. Atty.  Michael D. Bradbury made no active decisions in the case before deputizing two  Los Angeles deputy district attorneys as special prosecutors and turning over  all authority in the case to Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner.  </P> <P> Bradbury testified Thursday that he made the decision to charge Sconce with  murder and a special circumstance of murder by poison, which could allow  prosecutors to seek the death penalty.  </P> <P> But he also admitted that he turned over authority to Los Angeles County Deputy  Dist. Atty. Harvey Giss to decide whether to seek the death penalty and had  never discussed the case with Reiner.  </P> <P> Bradbury said he realized it was a mistake to give up the authority and decided  to take it back when Diamond argued that relinquishing it was grounds for  dismissal. Bradbury said he has not decided whether to seek the death penalty  for Sconce.  </P> <P> After Bradbury's testimony, Jones reversed his tentative ruling.  </P> <P> Jones also gave Diamond permission to exhume Waters' body from a Burbank crypt  on an undisclosed date to test it for residue of oleander, the poison that  medical experts testified caused his death.  </P></p>

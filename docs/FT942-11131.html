			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of The Channel Tunnel (5): Eurotunnel's strongman - Profile / Alastair Morton Sir Alastair Morton, co-chairman of Eurotunnel, is pugnacious, blunt to the point of rudeness and can be a bully. At other times he can be charming and humorous. He is undoubtedly charismatic and commands a grudging respect even from his critics. No one has dominated the construction of the Channel Tunnel quite like Morton. Over the past six years he has antagonised contractors; battled with BR and SNCF; and criticised government ministers, particularly British, for holding back the project. Joe Dwyer, chief executive of UK construction group Wimpey, when Morton last summer was simultaneously threatening to sue for damages contractors, BR and SNCF and the British government, sighed: 'Surely, we cannot all be in the wrong.' Morton's detractors insist that the row with British and French contractors over their claims for extra payments could have been settled and the project opened earlier but for his stubbornness and belligerence. But his aggressiveness may not have been a disadvantage as far as the banks were concerned. They needed to feel confident that they were giving their money to a tough client who would fight to protect their interests. The banks on several occasions supported Morton against attempts by contractors to unseat him. It is also doubtful that Morton could have persuaded the banks much earlier to accept the settlement finally agreed with the contractors. Even his fiercest critics among the construction companies admit that the project would never have started but for the energy and determination displayed by Morton in persuading banks and financial institutions to part with their money in the first place and then to stick with it when the going got tough and costs started to rise. His sharp mind and previous experience of working in the City gave them comfort that he would keep a tight rein on the project's finances. Morton, 56 last January, was born in Johannesburg. His father was a Scottish oil executive and his mother a member of an old Afrikaner family. He has never shrunk from speaking his mind whether to journalists, fellow executives or supposedly recalcitrant construction companies. It appears that he almost delights in rubbing people up the wrong way. He has been described as a man who cannot pass a calm pond without throwing a large rock into it, just to see what happens. He will fight fiercely, not shrinking from personal attacks, to defend his judgment. He is a busy sender of letters and faxes to editors and others who have taken opposing views or have offended. For such an outspoken character, he harbours surprisingly few grudges. One French contractor involved in the long running battles over costs said: 'After the storm there is the calm. Alastair having argued until he is red in the face that you are wrong, will suddenly say 'OK you win' and he will be absolutely charming.' Equally, he has not been afraid to back his judgment when he feels he is right. He resigned as managing director of the British National Oil Corporation after clashing with BNOC's chairman Sir Philip Shelbourne over privatisation. The Bank of England subsequently prevailed upon him to take the helm at Guiness Peat, the ailing banking group. He publicly rowed with the bank's founder and major shareholder, Lord Kissin, over asset disposals and resigned after a successful hostile takeover by Equiticorp of New Zealand. Chancellor Kenneth Clarke has now appointed Morton head of a working group to encourage greater private sector investment in infrastructure. He will not shrink from criticising government if he thinks this necessary and contractors may yet be glad to see their former adversary lining up up on their side.</p>

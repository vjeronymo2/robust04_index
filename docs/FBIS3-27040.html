Last year alone, this writer  received 183 business cards from friends serving in the  military. These cards belong to both cadres and soldiers, with  168 people engaging in office work, accounting for 92 percent,  and 15 others working in military-run enterprises, accounting  for 8 percent.    These business cards are characterized by the abundant use  of  Army unit designations, titles, and sensitive internal Army  telephone numbers. With these problems in mind, this writer has  conducted investigations in several Army units. People have  reported that the indiscriminate printing and distribution of  business cards poses many disadvantages to army building: It  endangers the management and security of the barracks areas.  After taking the business cards offered them by servicemen, some  job-seekers have visited various Army units "out of admiration."  To find a suitable job, they go to this office today and that  office tomorrow in an effort to establish a network of  relationships. This has not only disrupted the normal work and  order in the barracks areas but has also encouraged unhealthy  practices. Some unscrupulous persons have even taken advantage  of the opportunity to commit crimes in Army units.    It discredits the Army units' prestige. To build up their  social status, some servicemen have indiscriminately added  titles to their business cards, such as "director" of this  factory, "manager" or "business section head" of that company,  and "member" or "director" of a wide variety of societies and  associations. As some are not worthy of these titles, the  prestige of the Army units has suffered.    It is not conducive to confidential nature of the Army  units'  work. Some of the business cards carry the Army unit  designation, detailed address, and internal telephone numbers.  This has undoubtedly gravely damaged confidentiality. There  has been no lack of lessons in this regard. According to an  armed services newspaper report on 27 March 1993, an operational  staff officer called He from an Army unit stationed in a special  economic zone gave his cousin in Hong Kong a business card  bearing the address and classified telephone number of his unit.  The result is that the classified telephone is no longer  classified. A certain clerical worker called Huang also brought  losses to army building by indiscriminately distributing his  business cards, which have been made use of by an enemy agent.    In short, the fashion of distributing business cards in Army  units has more disadvantages than advantages for army building  and should arouse the close attention of the department  concerned. It is necessary to adopt effective measures to step  up guidance and management, especially to strictly observe  security discipline.</p>

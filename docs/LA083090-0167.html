			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> BEST BETS: DAREDEVILS WILL WING IT AT AIR SHOW  </P> <P> Snap rolls, hammerhead stalls, tail slides and wing walks are all part of the  14th annual Oxnard Air Show on Saturday and Sunday at Oxnard Airport.  </P> <P> "The whole family can look forward to a weekend of daredevil excitement," air  show Chairman Steve Barber said.  </P> <P> About 30 people are scheduled to entertain both days, including stunt pilots,  parachutists and a sailplane aerobatic team.  </P> <P> Flier Jim Franklin will perform two solo acts each day. He will also team with  wing walker Johnny Kazian.  </P> <P> "Kazian will be untethered, holding on to a bar, nothing else, walking out  along the wing while Franklin flies along at high speed," Barber said.  </P> <P> Oxnard resident and world record stunt pilot Joann Osterud will race Scott  Hammack's "Smoke 'n' Thunder" jet engine-powered dragster, which accelerates to  300 m.p.h. in six seconds.  </P> <P> Participants can also see more than 70 aircraft displays, including military  and vintage models. Food and beverages will be available.  </P> <P> The gates will open at 10 a.m., and performances will run from 1 to 4 p.m.  Tickets are $7, $5 for seniors and $3 for children aged 6 to 12.

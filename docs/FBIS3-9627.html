			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Prime Minister Peter Boross by </F> correspondent Laszlo Rapcsanyi; place and date not given;  passages within quotation marks are recorded]    [Text] [Announcer] The radio today carried an interview  with Prime Minister Peter Boross. The reporter was Laszlo  Rapcsanyi. From the topics of the one-hour interview, first we  quote Peter Boross talking about the advance of the left wing.    [Boross] "It is indisputable that the Hungarian Socialist  Party [HSP] is going to achieve a more favorable result than at  the elections four years ago. It is also doubtless, I note --  not so much, and not first and foremost on the level of  leadership but in the ranks of the returning members -- there  will be some shift to the left. Despite this, I am not afraid  of a rollback. Essentally, the Hungarian parliament today  consists of sane politicians. No such rollback can take place  for this very reason."    [Announcer] After this the prime minster talked about the  role of the trade unions and the HSP, considering the chances  for the near future.    [Boross] "The trade unions have gained significant ground  within the HSP. This threatens the HSP's functioning as a  political party. I have to say that I can see a dual phenomenon  here: If by any chance the HSP gets a government role then an  excessive trade union force would make the program, hallmarked  by the name of Laszlo Bekesi, simply inexecutable."    [Announcer] Since there are only six weeks until the  elections there was of course mention of the chances of the  liberal parties.    [Boross] "I consider it natural that the liberal parties are  decreasing and slowly crumbling away. Some time later they will  be represented in Hungarian political life in a proportion which  is typical of most countries. I think this election contest is  really between the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] and the HSP.  The erosion of the two party formations in the range between  them is unavoidable."    [Announcer] What can be expected generally after the  election  results are known? Who can form a coalition with whom?  According to Peter Boross:    [Boross] "Every party has to decide what future a coalition  relationship can have, from the viewpoint of its future, even if  it seems to be somehow tactical or -- under various pressures --  expedient to form a coalition with certain parties. Are they  not too distant from one another? If so, they can set up a  coalition at a roundtable, but they cannot make the coalition  work."    [Announcer] Can a coalition which was set up under pressure  be viable?    [Boross] "There is the possibility that the next elections  will not be held in four years' time, if the parliamentary power  relations given by the election results make it impossible to  create a sustainable majority. It is typical that there was a  prediction which estimated the Hungarian political balance as 30  percent so-called Christian conservatives, 30 percent liberals,  and 30 percent socialists. Well, those who are familiar with  the participants of Hungarian politics know that if this were to  come about, it would result in a state of ungovernability."    [Announcer] The opposition accuses the government of  pursuing  a propaganda which only emphasises the successes. The prime  minister's opinion about this:    [Boross] "We have to show that we have achieved results in  the difficult situation the country is facing and under the  extremely testing circumstances of the transformation. The  other side should come up with concrete proof about specific  issues -- not criticize everything with general phrases. The  leftist part of the parliament knows and the opposition press  knows that the MDF or the government -- I always need to mention  them together -- fails to mention the fact that it has preserved  the value of savings with an appropriate interest policy,  something which has not been done in any of the neighboring  countries. It has indeed preserved this."    [Announcer] At the end of the interview Prime Minister Peter  Boross talked about his plans.    [Boross] "I would like to work as prime minister for another  four years. This half year was not enough. I believe I know  what should be done in the next four years and I feel I have  enough strength for the implementation of my ideas."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Straight Talk" program hosted by Osvaldo Rodriguez of </F> BOHEMIA magazine and Luis Sexto of BOHEMIA magazine; date not  given -- live or recorded]    [Text] [Rodriguez] Good afternoon, friends. This is  Straight Talk here on Radio Rebelde. If the economic measures  are good, why do they affect me? Luis Sexto and yours truly,  Osvaldo Rodriguez, both of BOHEMIA magazine, will talk straight  here about this topic. Luis, I think many good people are asking  this question. They have yet to understand why they must be  affected during this phase. In fact, many people are talking  about this and are even feeling some rejection of the measures.  They ask: Why? Why do I have to continue sacrificing?    I recently spoke with a young woman with a 19-year-old son.  She faces a very difficult economic situation because they live  on her salary and the meager salary her son recently began to  earn. She has to face a black market that, as we all know,  swindles people; and now she faces these measures. She  exclaimed: I see no way out of this situation! I see no  solution! I do not think the measures will solve my problem! I  think that, inspired by the young woman's example, we should  answer those who think like this, who believe the measures  affect them without necessarily presenting a solution to their  problem.    [Sexto] I think the situation is similar to that of a  critically ill patient who asks his doctor: Doctor, if you are  trying to save me, why are you making me go hungry? In this  hypothetical case, I imagine the doctor would answer: Precisely  to save your life. In other words, I believe the measures to  restore the internal financial situation became effective on 1  June as part of a series of measures that I imagine will also be  implemented in the near future within our economy. They are  intended precisely to save the citizen's life, figuratively  speaking.    I believe that in almost all cases, saving a life involves a  heroic action, or a painful action, or a daring action. I do not  believe a life can be saved with a smile on your face or a sweep  of the hand. Like I said, the action per se implies heroism,  daring, and pain. Continuing the metaphor, we might add that  these measures strive to save our economy from excessive  liquidity, which as everyone knows, hampers productivity and  discourages work. It even boosts prices in the so-called  underground economy. We will talk about that later.    [Rodriguez] I think this is important to discuss because the  young woman I mentioned complained precisely about this. She  said: The measure only worsens things. On the one hand, the  state charges more; and, on the other hand, the speculators  raised their prices as soon as the measures were announced.  While she was debating this with me, I realized that her  desperation did not let her understand everything I tried to  explain. That is why I believe this analysis -- this is a  message to our listeners today -- must be made calmly, without  anger, without thinking about negative things.    Think positively, as the saying goes. You must think  positively because the financial measures may be something new  for us, but they have been enforced all over the world. The  problem is that other types of financial measures have also been  enforced throughout the world. They provoke large-scale  unemployment and privatizations -- that is the new liberal trend  -- but they always yield results when it comes to truly reducing  the balance of internal finances.    [Sexto] We have said this on previous occasions. Given the  current situation in Cuba, there is no option but to implement  this type of measures. They may resemble measures that were  implemented, or are being implemented, in other countries. We  said a few weeks ago that the measures strive to reduce  citizens' purchasing power. In other words, when there is an  excessive amount of money circulating because of scant  mercantile availability, the citizens, the workers accumulate  large sums of money. It is a salary that practically cannot be  spent in the official market, and is therefore accumulated -- or  else circulates in the so-called underground economy. It is the  same thing. In other words, the worker can give his money to the  speculator, to the black market vendor, but the money never  reaches the bank; the money never again reaches the state  vaults. It remains in circulation and negatively affects the  economy. Osvaldo, please allow me to continue for a moment. I  think this must be considered unavoidable. We cannot believe  there is any alternative under these circumstances. We must  understand this. I think that when we realize these are bitter  dregs that must be drunk to attain curative, therapeutic results  from the economic viewpoint, then we will begin to understand  the measures.    Suppose the Cuban Revolution does not implement these  measures; suppose another regime comes to rule the country  tomorrow; suppose it is another person with other ideas, another  social organization, another economic organization, they would  solve the situation the same way. I want our listeners to  realize this. There would be no other alternative but to  implement these measures. There would be a difference, however  between what the Cuban Revolution, what the revolutionary  government does today and what -- hypothetically speaking --  another government, another social regime would do. Evidently,  it has been said that these measures... [pauses] I have read  some foreign news agencies' reports. They state: Cubans claim  these are not shock measures but, if the price of cigarettes is  raised almost 700 percent, or 500 percent, is this not a shock  measure? Well, it depends on how you look at it. If the  cigarettes' usual price is raised 500 percent or 600 percent,  but the public health budget remains unchanged, and the  education budget remains unchanged, then the measures are not  exactly shock measures.    [Rodriguez] Nevertheless, it depends on who evaluates  them. Some have called them moderate measures. They have not  necessarily called them harsh measures.    [Sexto] They are the most intelligent ones.    [Rodriguez] Yes, they are obviously the most intelligent  ones. Nevertheless, we are here, being affected by the measures,  and we consider them neither exaggerated nor weak measures. The  measures are negative; the measures undeniably affect us today;  but they will improve our situation. Furthermore, they represent  our only option. The only other possible option would be to have  enough products to fill the market. We all know that given the  current circumstances in our economy, we have no money to import  the necessary products or the raw materials to manufacture them  in the country.    In due time -- technicians and experts say in not less than  18 months -- we will realize the essential results of these  measures. The peso -- the value of which has decreased, which is  devalued, and which people practically do not even consider  nowadays -- will be much more valuable. The peso will assume  more value, proportionate to the degree to which I must use  pesos from my salary to pay for services and products. We will  see the peso recover its value to the extent that money  circulating in the country achieves a rational, stable value, a  value recommended by experts, a figure suggested by common  sense, so far as financial sense is concerned.    In fact, to reassure certain people... [pauses] you know  that  many people worry about the black market and the underground  economy. Many think that the black market and the underground  economy solve the people's problems. I wish to dispute what  those people say. I say the black market does not provide for  the country because I am quite convinced that the amount of  merchandise circulating in the black market is a minimal amount;  it is a minimal volume of merchandise.    Aside from that, no family can afford black market prices.  You must clearly realize that. No one can live on the black  market. The problem is that the black market also creates an  illusion, the same illusion created by the peasant's free  market, the illusion of a store window full of things that I can  buy. The truth is that you buy two pounds of rice today, two  pounds of beans another day, a chicken on another day, and a  piece of pork on yet another, but when you add up two pounds of  rice, two pounds of beans, a chicken, plus a piece of pork, it  represents much more than the income of a family in which four  persons work.    [Sexto] Of course. But there is more, Osvaldo. There is  more.  It is an illusion. The amount of merchandise in the underground  economy is a mixture of black market mechandise and merchandise  that, in one way or another, comes from legal sources. The  minimum volume of the underground economy is indicated precisely  by the high prices of that economy. The blind, deaf laws of a  market economy prevail in the undergound economy, the so-called  black market. If I have a small amount, the prices go up. If  there was a lot of merchandise in that market....    [Rodriguez, interrupting] The prices would drop.    [Sexto] The prices would not be so enormous, so brutal.    [Rodriguez] We will now have to see how the cigarette prices  react, for example, where there is a sufficient supply [words  indistinct].    [Sexto] Of course, of course.    [Rodriguez] If there is a need to sell cigarettes in the  undergound economy... [pauses] I think some people buy their  quota even though they do not smoke. They will buy it at 6 or 7  pesos; and, if they want to sell it to get additional income,  they will have to sell it for less than the open market price,  which is 9 pesos. In other words, they cannot sell it for a much  higher price because there is a volume of cigarettes on the open  market and the black market therefore has no reason to exist.  The underground economy has absolutely no reason to exist.    [Sexto] You said the black market prices are high because  there is a small amount of merchandise.    [Rodriguez] That is right. Also, to the degree that excess  circulating money and excess money in the Cuban people's hands  decreases as a result of all these measures... [pauses] for the  sake of calming some people who worry about this -- personally  speaking, I have had altercations with certain people -- I state  that the black market will tend to decrease because it must be  proportionate to the volume of circulating money and the  people's purchasing ability.    [Sexto] Of course. To the degree that there is less money,  there will be less opportunity to demand a high price.  Therefore, Osvaldo, to conclude -- I think you are reminding me  that we are running out of time -- I believe this must be  considered a sick person's unavoidable step toward recovery. He  must undergo a treatment that many times proves uncomfortable or  painful.    I also issue an appeal to the people's patriotic spirit. The  citizens cannot think only with the lower levels of their  conscience. They must also think with the superior levels. We  have a debt toward the Cuban Revolution. We might talk about  that in another program. I believe that we must protect the  Cuban Revolution's achievements by making a contribution today  -- this sacrifice.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno from Miraflores Palace; from the </F> "Union Radio News" newscast]    [Text] According to Antonio Casas Gonzalez, president of  the Central Bank of Venezuela, the U.S. dollar's downward trend  is making it very unlikely to implement controls on foreign  exchange. Casas has said that although he respects Dr. Maza  Zavala's opinion in this regard, he opposes Maza's proposed  formula, because the nonexistence of a parallel market with the  application of the auction system will lead to a single  bolivar-dollar exchange rate.    Casas briefed President Rafael Caldera on the progress of  the  foreign exchange market during the course of the week, following  implementation of a new exchange system. He has said the U.S.  dollar has been revalued, but there is a downward trend on  dollar prices.    The Central Bank president has agreed with Finance Minister  Julio Sosa Rodriguez that the exchange rate could ultimately be  set at 150 bolivares per dollar.    [Begin recording] [Casas] I would say the exchange rate  could  be set at approximately 150 bolivares per dollar. I would not  dare quote an exact figure, because there is a psychological  demand that still exists, but this demand has been reduced. You  can now see there are no lines at currency exchange facilities,  but we do not know yet how much of that psychological demand....    [Unidentified reporter, interrupting] Will the....    [Casas interrupting] That is not a real demand; therefore,  the demand must continue to go down.    [Reporter] Will the demand for the U.S. dollar continue to  decrease?    [Casas] We think so, because there is still some  psychological demand.    [Reporter] Will this system [words indistinct]?    [Casas] Yes, it has yielded very positive results. First,  because the exchange rate has declined, and second, because it  has taken us to a single exchange rate, which is very open.    [Reporter] Are we moving toward a unique rate of exchange?    [Casas] Obviously, as can be seen in the graphs published  recently.    [Reporter] How long will this process take?    [Casas] We have practically reached a single exchange rate.  If you see the curves....    [Reporter, interrupting] [Words indistinct] stabilization?    [Casas] The important thing is stabilization. A country  without a stable currency.... [pauses] Venezuelans must have  confidence in our currency. This country has much to give. [end  recording]    The fact of the matter is the government and directors of  the  Central Bank of Venezuela are optimistic and confident about the  complete normalization of the foreign exchange market.</p>

			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA;  </P> <P> WATER RATE PLAN REJECTED  </P> <P> The Pasadena Board of Directors has rejected a plan by the city's Water  Division staff to restructure city water rates after residents complained that  the plan would increase costs for homeowners with extensive landscaping.  </P> <P> The board has instructed the Water Division staff to return with a revised plan  on Sept. 19.  </P> <P> The proposed plan would have generated $839,000 needed for additional operating  expenses by discouraging high-volume water use and rewarding conservation.  Low-volume water users would have had lower bills under the plan, while  high-volume users would have seen their rates rise as much as 40%.  </P> <P> But after a contingent of homeowners from Chapman Woods protested at Tuesday's  meeting that the proposed increase discriminated against homeowners, the board  directed the staff to modify the plan and add a 3.15% rate increase for all  water users.  </P></p>

Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ARMY BOOSTS ROLE OF CONTRACT BIDS  </P> <P> The Army said today it has again raised its reliance on competitive bidding for  the award of procurement contracts.  </P> <P> In a report to Congress on fiscal 1988 actions, the Army said $18.45 billion --  or 61.6% of its total $29.94 billion in procurement dollars -- was awarded to  contractors after competitive bidding. This was an increase from 58.8% in  fiscal 1987 and a jump over the 41.2% awarded on a competitive basis in fiscal  1983, a year before the Army began a drive to limit the use of sole-source  contracts.  </P> <P> More than 93% of the individual contracts signed during fiscal 1988 were  awarded after competitive bidding, up from 88% in fiscal 1987 and 48% in fiscal  1983, the Army said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The provincial government held an on-the-spot  administrative meeting this morning in the Town and Township  Enterprises Administrative Department in order to review the  latest development of town and township enterprises throughout  the province, and to further organize and mobilize forces from  various quarters to continue supporting the development of town  and township enterprises. Governor Jia Zhijie and Vice Governor  Wang Shengtie attended the meeting to help town and township  enterprises get funds, then and there, to a sum of 1.5 billion  yuan. The provincial branch of the Agricultural Bank provided  1.2 billion yuan, the provincial branch of the Industrial and  Commercial Bank -- 120 million yuan, the provincial branch of  the Bank of China -- 100 million yuan, and the provinical branch  of the Construction Bank -- 80 million yuan.    This year town and township enterprises in our province have  continued to maintain their good momentum of development.  Various localities throughout the province generally have  accelerated their pace of development, and have increased their  economic efficiency markedly. Their products generally sell  well. From January to May this year, the total production  output value of rural industry was 26.9 billion yuan, an  increase of 89.69 percent over the same period last year.    After listening to reports on supporting the development of  town and township enterprises which were submitted by  responsible persons from organs directly under provincial  authorities, including the provincial planning commission,  economic commission, labor department, educational commission,  scientific and technological commission, the Agricultural Bank's  provincial branch, and the provincial financial, personnel, and  other departments, Governor Jia Zhijie said: This year, town  and township enterprises are developing very rapidly and  healthily. This has played a decisive role in maintaining the  pace of economic development in our province. To continue the  rapid development of town and township enterprises, we must make  a breakthrough in enhancing our understanding. We must have  sense of crisis and emergency. Party and government leaders at  all levels must place the development of town and township  enterprises on their agendas. Main leaders must grasp it  personally. They must persist in the idea of doing two types of  work simultaneously. They must grasp the development of town  and township enterprises, and lose no time in improving them. As  far as measures are concerned, they must adjust their targets of  struggle to ensure the fulfillment of the task of increasing  these enterprises' production output value to 150 billion yuan.  It is necessary to open up markets, increase product sales, and  establish sales teams for the markets for town and township  enterprises. It is necessary to carry out activities of  emulation and appraisal through comparison so as to create a  situation of each and every enterprise trying to overtake the  other. It is necessary to put the enhancement of management  level on the agenda. Management must be put on a scientific and  modern basis, and efforts must be made to attach importance to  training qualified personnel so as to increase the quality of  working personnel in town and township enterprises.</p>

			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A UNIFORM SOLUTION TO CLOTHING DILEMMA  </P> <P> After observing the latest round of back-to-school shopping for preteen  clothing, I would like to suggest a common-sense alternative to the ritualistic  sparring between preteens and their parents over what is appropriate for young  bodies ("Preteens' Clothing Choices: They're Dressed to Secede," Oct. 20).  </P> <P> Schoolchildren in America should do what most European and Asian children do  and wear uniforms to school each day. Uniforms save time and a lot of money for  the parents; they promote some sense of purpose and fellow-feeling at school,  and while they don't end competition for status among children, they do shunt  it away from one obvious and costly arena.  </P> <P> GARY S.

			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CREATIVE COMPROMISE IS ELUSIVE FOR ARTISTS, SPONSORS;  </P> <P> BOTH SIDES STUMBLE IN SEARCH FOR WORK THAT IS A BIT 'OUT THERE' -- BUT NOT TOO  FAR  </P> <P> While many artists are dropping out of performance, others have tried to adapt  to the pressures of playing to a more conventional audience. The compromise can  be painful.  </P> <P> "They want to make a living at it, but that's never what performance was about  before," said RoseLee Goldberg, who teaches performance art history at New York  University. "The artists find themselves trying to walk a tightrope between the  avant-garde and the establishment, and that is very difficult."  </P> <P> John White, a Venice artist who is also a UC Irvine guest lecturer on  performance, had an encounter with the Los Angeles Music Center last summer  that underscored the risks of creative compromise, both for artists and for  mainstream sponsors in search of art that is a little "out there."  </P> <P> For 20 years, White performed pieces that entwined aspects of visual art and  storytelling. He worked in storefronts, private homes, hospitals and schools,  rarely pocketing more that $300 a shot. He once hit a golf ball out of a  fourth-story window while blindfolded, as a concealed audiotape congratulated  him on the shot.  </P> <P> Discouraged by the sand-trap economics of performance, White quit 2 years ago  to focus on painting. But in 1987, when the Music Center invited proposals for  a piece for L.A. Alive Festival, White decided to give it one more swing, as a  director this time. He won the commission.  </P> <P> "The Music Center!" he declared. "Performance was going uptown, and I wanted to  see what that was like. For years, one of my big things has been to get  performance into venues where it had never played before. And they were  offering $2,000!"  </P> <P> He devised a light-heartedly funky, Californian spin on Dadaism: He had the  Shrimps -- an L.A.-based performance art/theatrical troupe, noted in part for  their big, wide or elongated bodies -- dress in tropical Hawaiian outfits and  throw around tires, crates, ladders and other junkyard items -- all painted  black.  </P> <P> Two days before show time, he received a phone call. Esther Wachtell, the Music  Center's president, had about 10 complaints from people who had seen White's  work in rehearsal on the outdoor plaza.  </P> <P> "People were eating their lunch, and they were from senior citizens' housing  and apartments nearby," Wachtell said. "They were watching him rehearse and  were offended by the anger that seemed to underlay a lot of his presentation."  </P> <P> Wachtell asked Music Center volunteer Jennifer Diener to ask White to shorten  his piece and use "a little less volatile flinging around."  </P> <P> Diener said she passed on those complaints and one other, about the Shrimps.  White said he will always remember her remark: "Those peoples' bodies aren't  the sorts of bodies we want associated with the image of the Los Angeles Music  Center."  </P> <P> Attempting a cure-all concession that still poked fun at what he perceived as  the Music Center's stuffy self-regard, White dressed his performers in tuxedos.  But he said he has not regained his sense of humor about the episode.  </P> <P> Now he believes that he is back to painting for good: "Having control over what  I do is my only power as an artist. Taking that away from people will be the  death of performance." ALLAN JALON  </P></p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / EU warns it may use force to free blocked aid in Bosnia The Belgian presidency of the European Union yesterday served notice that Europe was ready to use force against local warlords blocking the flow of humanitarian aid in Bosnia. The warning followed talks in Brussels between Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, and Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, which helped lay the groundwork for next month's visit by President Bill Clinton to Europe and a Nato summit. The talks were a clear effort to patch over the political rift which surfaced in the transatlantic relationship earlier this year, principally over US support for arming the Bosnian Moslems against the Serbs. Mr Christopher said the US opposed using the threat of a suspension of humanitarian aid as a lever on the Bosnian government to offer concessions in the Geneva peace talks. Meanwhile, Bosnian government officials yesterday signalled for the first time that they might accept the partition of the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo. Mr Muhamed Sacirbey, Bosnia's ambassador to the UN said: 'If the division is what we need to save lives ...The Serbs are insisting on it, while we are wondering how to survive the winter." A member of the Serb delegation yesterday said he believed the two sides were on the verge of making a deal. He said Serbs had offered to make territorial concessions outside of Sarajevo, if they were given 40 per cent of the capital. Moslem leaders reportedly rejected the Serbian proposal to exchange two industrial suburbs, Vogosca and Ilijas, in exchange for the Moslem enclaves of Srebrenica and Zepa, eastern Bosnia. Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, had earlier put forward a map outlining a mostly Moslem republic. Speaking on condition of anonymity, a member of the Bosnian Serb delegation yesterday dismissed the map as 'maximalist'. In addition to Moslem demands for eastern Bosnia, a key sticking point remains their plan to gain a land connection to the Adriatic and a 10km stretch of the coast. Croat leaders this week reiterated their refusal to hand over any portion of the coast. In exchange for the gradual lifting of sanctions on Belgrade, the European Union 'action plan' says Serb leaders must hand over 3-4 per cent more land to their Moslem adversaries, in addition to the 20 per cent of land envisaged in the plan brokered by the international mediators.</p>

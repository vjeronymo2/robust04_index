			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report The London Commodity Exchange's robusta COFFEE contract, after experiencing a dull and generally weaker morning, surged ahead yesterday afternoon on what traders described as buying related to availability of coffee against September delivery. With tenders for delivery against near the September contract amounting to just under 2,000 lots (5 tonnes each) and an uncovered position of just under 5,000 lots, the posting of about 100 lots of untenderables had sparked what seemed to be over-exaggerated concern, they said. The November futures position touched Dollars 1,265 a tonne before closing at Dollars 1,248, up Dollars 25 on balance. COCOA prices also moved higher in the afternoon, with the December position closing Pounds 8 up at Pounds 831 a tonne. 'I think the market is teeing itself to move higher this week but if it fails, it's ready to fall right back down,' one trader said. At the London Metal Exchange COPPER market the main focus of attention was in nearby spreads, which saw heavy trading activity. The cash premium over three months metal touched Dollars 70 at one stage before ending at Dollars 58 a tonne, compared with Dollars 52 to Dollars 53 yesterday. Compiled from Reuters</p>

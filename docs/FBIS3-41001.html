			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lexington, Massachusetts February 3 (NEWSWIRE-TASS)  -- The U.S. Raytheon engineers and constructors has announced  that, as a participant in the German-American consortium  established to build enterprises in Russia for the elimination  of chemical weapons, it is taking part in working out a  conceptual framework for designing and building one such  enterprise near Saratov.    Raytheon engineers and constructors is a member of the U.S.-  German consortium controlled by Lurgi environmental  Participating Organisation Ltd (Lub/Lurgi Umweltbeteiligungs  Geselschaft), which was awarded a contract by the Russian  government to build a plant for the elimination of chemical  weapons.    Other members of the consortium are German firms Uhde GMBH,  a  branch of Hoechst AG, Entsorgungs und Sanierungstechnik (EST),  and a subsidiary of Deutsche Aerospace.    As one of 130 consignees of the Paris convention banning  chemical weapons, Russia, which joined it in January 1993, is  obliged to eliminate all its materials designed for conducting  chemical warfare before the year 2005. Russia has officially  admitted that it has 40,000 tonnes of such materials.    The consortium brings together the world's two companies  which have experience of operating chemical weapon elimination  installations. Raytheon engineers and constructors installed  and networked equipment for the single operating plant for the  elimination of chemical weapons of the U.S. Army. It is located  in the Johnston Atoll in the Pacific Ocean. The plant, operated  by the same company, can destroy up to 1,000 tonnes of chemical  agents annually.    Lurgi has been running and maintaining a similar plant for  the German government in Lower Saxony since it was established  in 1982.    The German Foreign Ministry in October 1993 allocated 3.2  million DM (about two million U.S. dollars) to finance the phase  of the development of the conceptual framework for the  Lub/Saratov project. The working out of the conceptual framework  is scheduled to be completed in March 1994.    Raytheon engineers and constructors is one of the major  machine-building and construction companies in the world. This  is one of the four spheres in which Raytheon (Nyse code rtn) is  doing business. It specialises in various technologies,  including production of electronic, aircraft and basic electric  equipment. The company's capital totals nine billion U.S.  dollars.

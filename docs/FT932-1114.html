			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Australian deficit cut The Australian government has reduced its 1992-93 budget deficit estimate from ADollars 15.9bn (Pounds 7.1bn) to ADollars 15bn because of a higher than expected collection of company tax and an underspending on infrastructure works, writes Emilia Tagaza in Melbourne. But Mr John Dawkins, federal treasurer, said the improved outcome would not affect the ADollars 18bn starting deficit expected in 1993-94. This reflects the carrying over of infrastructure works and welfare spending promised during the March election.</p>

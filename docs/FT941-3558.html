			<p>940316 FT  16 MAR 94 / Russia to export 2m tonnes of grain Russia will not only cut grain imports to a minimum this year, but intends to export 2m tonnes, the deputy agriculture minister, Mr Vladimir Shcherbak, told a government commission meeting, Reuter reports from Moscow. RIA news agency quoted him as saying domestic supplies were sufficient to meet most demand, but there would still have to be some small imports of certain types of grain. These should include 100,000 tonnes of corn seed, already covered by preliminary agreements and waiting in western ports to be delivered, Mr Shcherbak said. But foreign companies were seeking finance ministry payment guarantees before making shipments, and the agreements could still fall through, he said. Russia imported about 11m tonnes of grain in 1993, down from 25m tonnes in the previous year. Mr Shcherbak gave no details of the planned exports.</p>

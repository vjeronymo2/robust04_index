			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Observer: Abs's last stand Don't cross Hermann Abs, the grand old man of German banking. It may come as a surprise but there are still some executives in Germany who haven't yet taken this basic banking tenet to heart. The latest casualty is Klaus Gallwitz, director of the Stadel, Frankfurt's premier art gallery, who has been forced to take early retirement. The reason is one row too many with the almost 91-year-old Abs, who besides being Deutsche Bank's honorary president, has been the gallery's chairman for two decades and more. Gallwitz's departure next March will put an end to 19 years of feuding with his chairman. Their relationship seemed doomed from the start. Abs interfered with Gallwitz's first artistic decision at the gallery - the removal of a sentimental Goethe portrait from prominent display. Matters then went from bad to worse, the last straw coming 11 months ago when Gallwitz sent Abs a present for his 90th birthday - a catalogue of the museum's contents with completely blank pages. For a town which probably spends more than any other in Germany on culture - DM 470m a year - the saga of Abs and the art gallery director is fast becoming an embarrassment. The burghers of Frankfurt, who have to foot the bill, are increasingly nettled by the nonagenarian's meddling. Abs apparently favours Herbert Beck, director of the nearby Liebig sculpture museum, to take over from Gallwitz. Linda Reisch, the present cultural administrator of Frankfurt, is keeping her mouth shut, but it is rumoured that she is backing Christoph Vitali, head of another local museum. If Vitali doesn't get the job he may move on. In the view of a growing number of Frankfurters, however, Abs should be the one to resign.</p>

			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Management at MF Industrial may be set to launch buy-out A MANAGEMENT buy-out is believed to be imminent at MF Industrial, the Manchester-based construction equipment producer owned by Varity, the US-based manufacturer of farm and industrial machinery, vehicle components and diesel engines. MF, part of Varity's Massey Ferguson farm and industrial machinery group, said last night that it was unable to comment on a newspaper report yesterday that Varity is to dispose of the company. No comment was available from Varity, which has indicated that it may be interested in selling some non-core businesses. It is believed, however, that a management buy-out of MF supported by City institutions and banks is under discussion and close to being announced. MF would confirm only that it had told the MSF staff union that it had been looking for joint ventures or partners for three years. MF is a relatively small but separate part of Massey Ferguson, one of the world's leading producers of agricultural tractors. The unit was created from the merger in 1983 of Massey's industrial and construction equipment products, and has its one production facility in Manchester. Sales of MF grew from Dollars 53m in 1984 to an annual level of nearly Dollars 140m at the end of the 1980s. Since then, it has been caught up in the worldwide construction equipment recession. Production of backhoe loaders, its main product, has fallen from 3,200 in 1988 - a boom year for the construction equipment industry - to 2,900 in 1989, 2,000 in 1990 and 1,600 in 1991. In the UK market, MF has consistently managed just under 10 per cent of a backhoe loader market dominated by JCB of the UK and US-owned JI Case. Last year, MF sold 220 backhoe loaders in the UK out of a total market of 2,800. MF also has exclusive European rights to sell Korean-built ScatLoader skid-steer loaders. Massey Ferguson recently announced an agreement to relocate its 'master' parts warehouse from Urmston, near the MF plant at Stretford, to Desford, Leicestershire, where the warehousing will be handled by Caterpillar Logistics Services. This will lead to the closure of the Urmston warehouse with the loss of about 300 jobs.</p>

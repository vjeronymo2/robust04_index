			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> UNSCHEDULED STOP LANDS TRASH TRUCK INSIDE HOUSE  </P> <P> Martha Rodriguez was starting another typical day early Friday, talking on the  phone with her mother, when she looked out her bedroom window and saw a white  and blue garbage truck coming toward her house in National City.  </P> <P> Then she heard the loud crunch and felt the shake of a huge truck smashing into  her living room. Rodriguez threw down the phone and screamed, calling for her  4-year-old son, who was watching television in the living room.  </P> <P> But the little boy, Armando, was not hurt. Neither were his sisters, Cynthia,  10, and Maritza, 13, who were in their bedroom.  </P> <P> National City Fire Marshal Patti Schiff said the driver of the Alto Waste Corp.  garbage truck, Juan Naverez, had just finished emptying one dumpster shortly  before 9:30 a.m. in the apartment complex across the street and was about to  proceed to the next one when he accidentally put the truck in reverse. Before  Naverez, who was in the cab of the truck, could react, the truck had rolled  down the steep driveway and into Rodriguez's living room, Schiff said.  </P> <P> Next-door neighbor Raul Mendoza said he felt the ground move and heard screams  coming from the house. He ran outside to see the garbage truck covered in  rubble from the house and heard Rodriguez calling for her son, he said.  </P> <P> While other neighbors, shouting through the window, urged the distraught mother  to come out of the house, Mendoza and the truck driver's helper looked for the  boy amid the debris.  </P> <P> According to Mendoza, the boy was under the sofa, unharmed but scared.  </P> <P> The three children are staying with Rodriguez's mother in Spring Valley while  Rodriguez and her husband, Arnoldo, find a another place to stay until the  house is repaired. The National City Fire Department has declared it unsafe.  </P> <P> Rodriguez said that, even if the house can be fixed, she would rather move  because a similar accident almost happened once before. About a year ago, a car  coming out of an apartment development across the street backed all the way  into her front yard, barely missing the front door.  </P> <P> "Do you think that I am ever going to sit in that living room again?" she said.  </P> <P> Damage to the structure and contents were estimated at $30,000, Schiff said.  </P></p>

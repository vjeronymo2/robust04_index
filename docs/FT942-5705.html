			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Tradepoint requests exchange status Tradepoint Financial Networks, set up to develop an electronic share-dealing system, has applied to City regulators to become a recognised investment exchange. Tradepoint is authorised as a service company regime, but becoming a recognised exchange would put it on the same regulatory basis as other exchanges such as the London Stock Exchange and the London Metal Exchange, the company said yesterday. The change carries greater regulatory obligations, and higher regulatory fees. Mr Peter Bennett, chief executive, said the move would make it more easily recognisable to participants and enable it to deal on a 'peer to peer' basis with other exchanges. The new system is aimed at institutional investors and will be 'order-driven'. It will automatically match volumes and prices of share orders from buyers and sellers, in contrast to the quote-driven system that dominates the Stock Exchange, based on intermediaries' quotes.</p>

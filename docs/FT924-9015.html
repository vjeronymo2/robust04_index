			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Finance and the Family: Pension pitfalls WHAT will your pension be worth if you die? That is the question the Life Association of Scotland is urging policyholders to consider. A potential problem exists for those who have contributed to the old-style retirement annuity, or section 226 contracts. If a section 226 policyholder dies before retirement, his family will receive not the accumulated value of the fund, but either the return of the premiums; premiums with interest; or (in a limited number of cases) nothing at all. The loss could be enormous. According to LAS, someone who had invested Pounds 2,000 a year in a plan for the last 21 years might have built up a fund worth Pounds 154,000. If the plan merely returned premiums, the family would get just Pounds 42,000. There is a further potential difficulty. Many of these policies are not written in trust. As a consequence, if the policyholder's spouse dies shortly after his or her death, the family may face an inheritance tax bill on the policy's proceeds. Section 226 contracts were replaced by the modern 'personal pension plans' in July 1988 which do not have the same drawbacks. But some of the problems may also occur with section 32 policies, executive pension plans and money purchase schemes. What can be done to solve these problems, given that the transfer charges on a pension are so high? Life Association of Scotland stresses: 'It is likely that only a minority of people with this problem should switch policies in particular because of the heavy costs involved, unless they are in very poor health or have made the policy paid-up and so already incurred the costs.' LAS is issuing free Deed of Trust forms to allow policyholders to get round the potential IHT problems. Another solution is to add term assurance to cover the potential loss on death. This could be done at a relatively low cost. But if you do have one of these policies, you should first check what the death benefit will be - and take independent financial advice.</p>

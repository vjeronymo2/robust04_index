			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / Row over Irish beef subsidy looming A NEW political crisis is looming in Ireland, following the gagging of a parliamentary inquiry by the Supreme Court yesterday. The court ruled by a three-to-two majority that key cabinet decisions on government financial support given to the beef industry in 1988 are entitled to the protection of confidentiality under the constitution, and can therefore not be subject to scrutiny. The inquiry, known as the Beef Tribunal, was set up in June last year after allegations of fraud, malpractice and political connivance in the beef industry were made in parliament and broadcast in a TV documentary. The most serious charge for the government is that Goodman International, Europe's largest beef processor, exerted undue influence on government ministers resulting in almost half the country's export credit insurance being given to just two beef exporters, for sales to Iraq which Iraq later defaulted on. Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, was the industry minister at the time responsible for the allocation of the insurance. Mr Des O'Malley, the present minister, told the tribunal last month he believed Mr Reynolds had made 'serious errors of judgment' in having allocated insurance cover for the Iraqi exports, and the sourcing of some of the meat from outside Ireland by Goodman to supply the contracts amounted to 'a fraud on the taxpayer'. The tribunal was suspended after its chairman, Mr Justice Liam Hamilton, began questioning Mr Ray Burke, another former minister, on cabinet decisions in 1988 relating to the export insurance. Mr Dick Spring, leader of the opposition Labour party and a key figure in getting the tribunal established, said: 'This is going to lead to a very serious political crisis. 'A fundamental task of the tribunal has been hampered and I believe it will now be extremely difficult for it to carry out its mandate.' Mr Reynolds last night welcomed the Supreme Court ruling and dismissed opposition demands for an early recall of the parliament. Ireland's two main clearing banks, Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland, have raised their interest rates by half a point, bringing lending rates up to 13.5 per cent for overdrafts and 15 per cent for loans over five years.</p>

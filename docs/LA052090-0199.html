			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRUISE VIEWS: BROCHURES TELL MORE THAN THEY PERHAPS INTEND  </P> <P> What's that cruise ship you're thinking about sailing aboard really like?  </P> <P> It isn't difficult to figure out if you know how to read the brochure. That's  where a cruise line tells you the truth about itself, whether it means to or  not.  </P> <P> First, flip quickly through the brochure to get an overview. What did you  notice most?  </P> <P> If it was a Carnival Cruise Lines brochure you saw young people in bathing  suits dancing, exercising, laughing and drinking pink drinks; casinos with and  without people, Las Vegas-type showgirls in pink feathers and a huge midnight  buffet with toque-topped chefs from central casting.  </P> <P> In Society Expeditions' current brochure you see photos of passengers  hobnobbing with penguins and primitive tribesmen with spears and feathers, but  very little about food, drink and gambling. The line knows its passengers care  more about a close encounter with flora and fauna than a rendezvous with  surf-and-turf.  </P> <P> Costa Cruises, on the other hand, displays an inordinate amount of food and  drink in its 1990 Caribbean brochure, interspersed with an occasional  photograph of someone exercising or relaxing in the sauna.  </P> <P> Royal Viking Line features handsome, successful-looking, mature individuals  doing whatever it is that handsome, successful-looking, mature individuals do.  Princess, meanwhile, splits its focus between fitness, food and entertainment.  </P> <P> All brochures from all cruise lines are designed so as to appeal to a  specialized audience. Thus the choice of photographs can tell a lot about the  type of cruise.  </P> <P> Next, study the handsome, well-groomed models that beam at each other happily  in picture after picture. They represent the way in which that cruise line  visualizes its ideal passengers. Then see if you can find in the background any  slightly out-of-focus passengers who actually bought passage aboard that ship.  A few companies, notably Royal Cruise Line and Carnival Cruise Lines, do not  separate the real passengers from the models, which is one version of honesty  in advertising.  </P> <P> One of the most successful of all cruise photographs is in the Sea Goddess  brochures. A waiter in a white jacket and swimming trunks is serving glasses of  champagne from a silver tray to two laughing couples in the surf off Virgin  Gorda. Everyone who sees it knows immediately whether the Sea Goddess  experience is for them.  </P> <P> When you've finished with the photos, take a look at the itinerary. Where two  cities are listed, one in parentheses, such as Civitavecchia (for Rome) or  Livorno (for Florence), that's a clue that you may have a long bus ride from  the port city to the destination.  </P> <P> Check your calendar to see which day of the week you are in port if there's a  shopping opportunity; you don't want to arrive in St. Thomas on Sunday when  most places are closed.  </P> <P> An asterisk or the words "cruise by" lets you know that the ship does not call  in that port, but if you have your binoculars along you can get a glimpse of it  as you pass.  </P> <P> If the text extols an island where you get a breathtaking view from atop a  dormant volcano in the island's center and your itinerary shows that you dock  at 9 a.m. and sail at noon, there's no way you'll be able to see that view. If  your Greek Islands cruise arrives at Hydra at 9 p.m. and departs at 10:30 p.m.,  you won't get many slides to show the folks back home.  </P> <P> A deck plan can tell you as much about the ship as a good travel agent, once  you learn to decipher it. Look for the extras the cruise line doesn't promote,  such as self-service laundry, library, card room, sauna.  </P> <P> Colors on the cabin diagrams correspond with price categories in the brochure,  so you can tell easily how much a certain cabin will cost. Find those cabins  you do not want -- those immediately above or below a disco, casino or theater  if you're a light sleeper, those adjacent to elevators or lounge areas, those  that are squeezed into narrower areas toward the ship's bow.  </P> <P> Dining room diagrams can tip you off as to how close together the tables are  and whether there are any tables for two.  </P> <P> Cabin size, too, can be determined more easily from floor plans than  photographs, In the latter, the photographer is usually standing in the hallway  or crouched in the shower, shooting with a wide-angle lens to make the modest  stateroom look as big as possible.  </P> <P> Finally, spend some time carefully reading the fine print in the back of the  brochure before signing up for your dream vacation. Amount of deposit, method  of payment and cancellation regulations are spelled out, as well as the  company's policy on refunds, the "will not be responsible for" disclaimers, and  details on special diet requests, facilities for the disabled, minimum age of  children permitted on board, and whether or not the air fare to catch the ship  is included.  </P> <P> Most cabin prices are based on a "per person/double occupancy" rate, which  means that persons traveling alone who want a private cabin may have to pay a  surcharge. Some ships offer "guaranteed roommate" plans, meaning they will  match you with another person of the same sex. Failing that, they will allow  you to occupy the cabin alone at the per person/double occupancy rate. Third  and fourth passengers in a cabin occupying pull-down upper berths usually  travel at a lower fixed rate or sometimes, in the case of children, free.  </P> <P> Finally, beware of brochures bearing sketches instead of photographs. Unless  the ship is still under construction or undergoing major remodeling when the  brochure was issued, you're right to suspect that the line is trying to hide  something from you.  </P></p>

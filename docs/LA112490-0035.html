			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ANNOUNCER DOUCETTE'S FANS DECIDE TO TALK BACK  </P> <P> Regarding your Nov. 10 Viewpoint letter that referred to Eddie Doucette as a  bad announcer, several of my friends and I seriously question this judgment.  </P> <P> We travel often from Los Angeles to San Diego on game days and tune in to KMPC  because we're Rams fans and think Eddie is terrific. As women, we're not  supposed to know much about football, right? Well, we don't have any trouble  following Doucette's play-by-play.  </P> <P> When Bruce, Phil and Steve asked, "Is it us when it comes to knowing what's  happening on the field?" -- our answer is, yes, it is. Learn the game of  football, guys, before you tune in to Eddie. We love him!  </P> <P> LINDA LANKER, San Diego  </P></p>

			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Falconbridge to cut nickel output FALCONBRIDGE of Canada is to trim its nickel output by up to 15 per cent of capacity, joining the lengthening list of producers which have been forced into cutbacks by the slump in metal prices. The Toronto-based company, which is the western world's second biggest producer, yesterday outlined a number of measures that will reduce planned 1993 production of nickel matte at its Sudbury, Ontario mines to 38,000 tonnes, from an earlier estimate of 45,000 tonnes. Mr Lars-Eric Johansson, Falconbridge's chief financial officer, said that cuts were also possible at Falcondo, the company's ferronickel facility in the Dominican Republic, but that no final decision has yet been made. News of Falconbridge's action had only a marginal impact on the nickel market yesterday. The London Metal Exchange three months delivery price closed at Dollars 5,942.50 a tonne, up Dollars 27.50 on the day. Inco, which accounts for more than a quarter of the west's nickel output, began the belt-tightening among producers last month by announcing a 10 per cent reduction in output. Several others have subsequently followed its lead in response to stagnant demand from the world stainless steel industry and a sharp increase in exports of nickel and stainless steel scrap from eastern Europe. But Mr Ray Goldie, analyst at Richardson Greenshields in Toronto, said that the cutbacks are not yet sufficient to reverse the recent slide in nickel prices. Mr Goldie recently raised his estimate of the third-quarter supply surplus from 13.9 per cent to 14.2 per cent. He said that Falconbridge's cuts would narrow that gap by 0.7 per cent. The normal two-week summer shutdown at the Sudbury division will be extended to ten weeks next year. In addition, the commissioning of a new shaft at the Craig mine, which was originally due to take place next August, has been postponed for at least a year or two. Besides cutting production capacity, the deferment will save Falconbridge CDollars 25m-30m (Pounds 13.1m-Pounds 15.8m) in spending on new machinery and equipment. The Nikkelverk refinery in Norway, which gets the bulk of its raw material from Canada, will be closed for seven weeks in the early summer of 1993. Mr Johansson said that the refinery's output next year was now estimated at 'not more than' 54,000-55,000 tonnes, compared with 56,000 tonnes this year. Falconbridge, whose shareholders are Canada's Noranda and Trelleborg of Sweden, also said yesterday that its third-quarter earnings rose to CDollars 7.9m from CDollars 3.7m a year earlier. The average price realised during the three months was USDollars 3.40 a lb, well above present prices.</p>

			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Ruling coalition agrees new taxes Leaders of Japan's three ruling coalition parties were said yesterday to have agreed on the content of a package of tax measures, but not on its form. Mr Masayoshi Takemura, the Japanese finance minister, and leader of the New Harbinger party, the smallest coalition member, said the Social Democratic party (SDP) had agreed in principle to an increase in the consumption tax to 5 per cent from 3 per cent, to take effect from 1997. The parties also agreed on immediate income tax cuts worth around Y5,500bn (Pounds 36bn) a year for the next three years. The decision to accept an increase in the consumption tax represents a policy retreat by the socialists, who had vehemently opposed any increase in indirect taxation to pay for the income tax cuts. However, the final sticking-point for the party appears to be the timing of the changes. The Liberal Democratic party and New Harbinger party want to introduce both measures as part of a single package. However, many SDP members are anxious to separate the two proposals in the thinly disguised hope that parliament may reject or delay the consumption tax increase.</p>

			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Peace talks on Russian leadership break down: Parliament set to vote on impeachment of Yeltsin RUSSIA'S political crisis intensified yesterday after the failure of talks between President Boris Yeltsin and Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, speaker of the conservative-dominated parliament. The impasse at the end of the 90-minute meeting between the two opponents leaves the way open for a vote on impeaching the president tomorrow. Mr Yeltsin's office said after the talks - attended by Mr Valery Zorkin, chairman of the Constitutional Court - that the parliamentary leadership had 'again rejected the simple and clear solution proposed by the president, to decide the fate of Russian statehood by a national vote'. The statement said a debate on impeachment at an emergency session of the Congress of People's Deputies would 'sharply raise tensions in the country'. At the same time, however, doubts were expressed on all sides about the ability of Mr Yeltsin's opponents to raise the two-thirds majority needed for impeachment. Several anti-Yeltsin deputies said such a majority was not presently available, as representatives who could normally be counted on to vote against the president's decrees and proposals shied from the chaos widely forecast if he is called upon to step down. However, Mr Khasbulatov alluded to a measure, added to the constitution in December, under which the president could be stripped of his powers if he was deemed to have acted to disband or suspend any legally elected body of state authority. The increasingly feverish warnings of national catastrophe and division were given point last night with a report on the official Tass news service that Cossacks in southern Russia had declared an independent republic. Hopes of a compromise in Moscow had risen earlier yesterday with the publication of Mr Yeltsin's decree setting out the basis of his address to the people last Saturday, in which he had said he was assuming 'special powers'. The decree made no mention of these powers. Further efforts at compromise remain possible. Mr Khasbulatov, informing parliament last night of the failure of the talks, said he and Mr Yeltsin had discussed the possibility of a government of national accord. Robert Thomson in Tokyo and Ralph Atkins in London write: The Japanese government was confident last night that it had derailed a push for an emergency summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations to discuss the crisis in Russia. On returning from the US and Europe, Mr Hisashi Owada, vice-foreign minister, told Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, that support was increasing for the Japanese plan to host a ministerial-level meeting next month and then the G7 summit as scheduled in July. Mr John Major, UK prime minister, in a telephone conversation with US president Bill Clinton, re-emphasised that the G7 countries should encourage economic reform in Russia, particularly by promoting small businesses and privatisation. Jurek Martin reports from Washington: Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, sketched out a plan for closer co-operation between his country and leading industrialised nations, eventually leading to fully-fledged Russian membership of the G7. In a Washington speech prior to a White House session with Mr Clinton, Mr Kozyrev argued that the phased economic integration of Russia into the G7 'should become an integral part of the Russian-US co-operation programme.'

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> General Principles and Issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Restructuring Vocational and Adult Education Programs To Achieve the National Education Goals <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Results of recent studies of vocational and adult education reveal that considerable progress must be made in these areas if the Department hopes to achieve the National Education Goals. For example, the National Adult Literacy Survey found that as many as 90 million adults in the United States have serious problems with literacy, and, of those, approximately 40 to 44 million function at the lowest proficiency levels defined by the survey. With the American economy in transition, increasing global challenges to our economic competitiveness, and more jobs requiring a high level of technical expertise, our employment and training systems must produce greater numbers of skilled and adaptable workers than in the past.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> How can the Federal Vocational and Adult Education programs best be structured to help the Nation achieve the National Education Goals, particularly the goal of ensuring that every American is literate and possesses the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Promoting World-Class Standards for All Students <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A major theme of the Administration's earlier legislative proposals has been creating an expectation for all students to meet challenging academic or occupational skill standards. The Department is now exploring options for making this theme a core principle for the Perkins Act and Adult Education reauthorizations as well. Along these lines, how can these Federal Acts best incorporate systems of standards and implement these standards for all vocational and adult education students, including in-school and out-of-school youth, postsecondary students, adults, and special populations? How can these standards best be coordinated with standards developed under Goals 2000 and the reauthorized Elementary and Secondary Education Act?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Connecting Vocational and Adult Education to Broader Objectives for Achieving Education Reform <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> How can some of the other key themes of the Administration's earlier proposals_such as offering greater State, local, and school flexibility in exchange for accountability for student outcomes (including authorizing waivers of certain statutory and regulatory requirements), encouraging integration of services across categorical programs, and targeting resources more effectively_be incorporated in the Vocational and Adult Education reauthorization?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Linking the Perkins Act and the Adult Education Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Should some aspects of the Perkins Act and the Adult Education Act be meshed? For example, could the reauthorization coordinate resources to create a more coherent system for preparing youth and young adults for further education and employment?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Coordinating With Other Federal Programs and Initiatives <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In recent reports, the General Accounting Office identified, by its count, over 150 programs with employment training aspects, including several vocational and adult education programs. The GAO reports contend that the programs overlap one another and are poorly coordinated, and that their proliferation makes it difficult for States and localities to forge comprehensive employment training strategies. In light of these findings, how should Federal Vocational and Adult education statutes relate to other Federal programs, such as JTPA, Higher Education Act student aid programs, and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and to pending initiatives such as elementary and secondary education reform, welfare reform, and the Reemployment Act? How can Perkins Act and Adult Education Act resources be better deployed to meet national needs for workforce development?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Building Bridges Between Vocational Education, Adult Education, and the School-to-Work Opportunities Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Should the Perkins Act or the Adult Education Act, or both, be revised to complement the School-to-Work Opportunities Act? If so, how should this be accomplished? What principles and goals would be achieved by this linkage? Should some or all of Perkins Act resources be structured specifically to support the School-to-Work act?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Issues That Cut Across Both Vocational and Adult Education Programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

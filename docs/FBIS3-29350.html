Rumors have run wild since Kim Chong-il failed to appear at  any events marking his 52th birthday on Wednesday, with one  saying his succession was being threatened by a cut-off of  foreign fund channels and another claiming he was seriously  injured in a mysterious accident.    "There are some foreign media speculating something bad has  happened to Kim Chong-il after he made no public appearances on  his birthday," a senior official at the Joint Chiefs of Staff  headquarters said. "But we have found no signs of any problem  related to Kim," he said.    He recalled that foreign media had engaged in similar  speculation when Kim did not appear publicly for periods in the  past, adding that defense officials were nevertheless keeping a  close watch on North Korea and all affairs related to the  younger Kim.    Meanwhile, Yi Ki-taek, chairman of the opposition Democratic  Party, said he had been told of the rumors concerning Kim  Chong-il by "a person in the U.S. Government" four days ago.    Speaking to local and foreign journalists who swarmed his  office to query him about remarks made earlier in the day that  Kim seemed to have been seriously injured, Yi apparently stepped  back from the rumor, saying, "He is a reliable source but he  said his information had yet to be confirmed independently."</p>

			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Arts: Jewels in the St Petersburg crown - Cartier has jumped on the historical bandwagon IF YOU were a Russian Archduke, or the wife of an American magnate, and wanted a trinket to celebrate the New Year, 1890, you had a wide choice of international jewellers to call on. You might visit Boucheron or Chaumet, Faberge or Cartier. All these names still exist in some form but only one, Cartier, has managed to maintain, and build on, its historical pedigree. On Wednesday it unveiled an exhibition to tingle the nerves of reactionaries everywhere  - a display in the Hermitage in St Petersburg of 200 examples of its artistry, including jewels commissioned by 19th century Russian aristocrats. As a timely reminder of the Russian rush into the past, the body of Vladimir, the Romanoff claimant to the Czar's throne who died recently in the US, awaits interment in the city. He cannot join his forefathers in the vault of the cathedral of St Peter and St Paul until the authorities drill a hole through the concrete that the Soviets laid down in certain expectation of no more Romanoff burials. There might be a feeling that the people of St Petersburg currently want more down to earth imports from the West - food perhaps or drugs - rather than exquisitely crafted moustache trimmers or the Duchess of Windsor's panther brooch, but such a view insults their pride. Shortages are seen as a passing phase as Russia returns to its creative past in which jewels played a major part. Having dispensed with 20th century heroes it they are putting their trust in Faberge, or rather on his reputation, to restore prosperity to their city. Already jewellery craftsmen are setting up to revive the links. Indeed there was some feeling that a Faberge show, planned for later this year, had been elbowed out of the Hermitage by the Cartier display. There was always a close friendship, amounting to rivalry, between the two firms. Cartier was bowled over by Faberges designs in 1900 and copied his work on enamels, perfecting strident colours as against Faberge's more muted originals. It is thought that some of Cartier's pre-1914 jewels incorporated work made by Faberge craftsmen. Today Faberge's name is mostly associated with fragrances while Cartier had managed to maintain, and to build on, its reputation. The exhibition in St Petersburg is a brilliant, if expensive, promotional coup. If all goes well Cartier might be selling to rich Russians around 2010, but having the seal of approval of the Hermitage, the Palace built by Catherine the Great to house one of the world's finest art collections, lifts Cartier's brand name from a supplier of baubles to rich women to the creator of museum quality artifacts. It follows on a similar show, including many of the same jewels, in Paris in 1989. The bandwaggon moves on to Japan next year. Cartier's eyes are fixed on the Metropolitan Museum in New York. If it can get in there the cynical marketing message will have well and truly got home - buy a Cartier jewel and you are acquiring the patina of the past, a name approved by museum curators, rather than a cleverly assembled gathering of depreciating gem stones. Cartier has managed this because, in the early 1970s, it decided to establish an archive of its past work and designs. Through selective buying it has assembled around a thousand items, insured for Dollars 34m. Some of its purchases were bargains - like the Duchess of Windsor bracelet, passed over at the Sotheby's auction when prices were inflated, but acquired later, when they had fallen sharply. Some were not - like the Dollars 2.3m it paid for the Daisy Fellowes jewels. The Hermitage exhibition, which lasts until June 21, covers the great period of Cartier, from the 1860s to the 1930s. In the earlier decades Russians were among the firm's best customers. They have a great love of gems, derived from their own mines and from trading with the East, and they took the finest stones to Cartier in Paris to be converted into jewels. Unfortunately few pieces made for Russian clients are on display. So many have been lost, the jewels broken off and sold since the Revolution. The Cartier family left it late to visit Russia, 1904, by which time Faberge dominated the scene, so there are few objects with a definite Russian feel. The influence of Faberge on Cartier's output is marked, although the two firms avoided a head-on clash: Faberge specialised in animal designs while Cartier stuck with flowers. Cartier will not do copies of its museum pieces - they would never look quite right. Nor does it use many ideas from the archive. But the Cartier exhibition, although it may be a clever marketing exercise, also presents a more than decent show.</p>

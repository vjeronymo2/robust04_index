			<p>BFN     [Text] CHATURAT: Laos is a country rich in natural  resources, especially timber and minerals. However, it has no  money to tap these treasures. Will your government accept  foreign investment and on what conditions?    Kaysone: Our government is ready to cooperate in economic  development with all countries on the principle of equity and  posing no threat to our independence.    CHATURAT: What is the top priority on the list of your  government's economic development plan?    Kaysone: We will turn our country into an industrial nation  based on agriculture and forestry.    Norman Pegam, special reporter of CHATURAT magazine, asked  these two questions to Kaysone Phomvihan, former president of  the Lao People's Democratic Republic [LPDR] and former head of  the Lao People's Revolutionary Party [LPRP], 18 years ago. The  answers were nothing but a plan which would take decades for its  materialization.    The promulgation of the "New Economic Mechanism" or  "Restructuring" policy was the first sign of the plan being  materialized. Kaysone Phomvihan proposed the policy during the  fourth party congress in 1986 to lay the foundation for  decentralized economic development.    During the fifth congress in 1991, the LPRP announced the  national socioeconomic development plan for the period from 1993  to 2000. The plan encourages the application of capitalism  rules but refuses to let the country plunge into the orbit of  capitalism. However, the official opening of the bridge [linking  Vientiane capital with Thailand's Nong Khai Province] this month  will attach Laos to capitalism.    Although Laos' centralized economic system has been shifted  to Lao-style capitalism, its political system remains  "Lao-style" democracy or centralized democracy. It is apparent  that the centralized power is in the hands of the group of  "party leaders from southern Laos."    The Road of Power Stretches to the South [Subhead]    After the death of Kaysone Phomvihan in 1992, Nouhak  Phoumsavan was named the new president of the LPDR while General  Khamtai Siphandon became chairman of the LPRP.    The appointments of Kaysone Phomvihan's close comrades in  arms to the highest posts to administer the country and party  brought an abrupt end to the anticipation of a massive reshuffle  of the power holders.    The allocation of important posts in the National Assembly,  Council of Ministers, and party indicates an attempt to keep the  power well balanced at a certain level. President Nouhak  Phoumsavan has the power to appoint or dismiss the prime  minister while Prime Minister Khamtai Siphandon, in his capacity  as chairman of the party, also has the power to propose to the  National Assembly the appointment or dismissal of the president.    It should be noted that Nouhak Phoumsavan, a native of  Savannakhet Province, is classified as a member of the political  group of former President Kaysone Phomvihan; Phoun Sipaseut,  deputy prime minister in charge of foreign affairs; and Phao  Bounnaphon, minister attached to the Prime Minister's Office.    Meanwhile, General Khamtai Siphandon, a native of Khon  District in Champassak Province, belongs to the Champassak power  group. Defense Minister Lieutenant Choummali Sai-gnason and  National Assembly President Saman Vi-gnaket also come from this  group.    Gen. Khamtai belongs to the Lao Thoeng ethnic group. Other  personalities belonging to this ethnic group include renowned  economist Khamphoui Keoboualapha, deputy prime minister in  charge of economic affairs and member of the Commission for  Planning and Cooperation with Foreign Countries. The  commission, in coordination with the other four economic  agencies -- namely the Finance Ministry, Trade Ministry, Foreign  Ministry, and the State Bank -- is fully responsible for the  control and promotion of foreign investment.    Glancing at the list of members of the party's Political  Bureau appointed by the fifth party congress, it appears that  more than half of them are southerners, namely Nouhak Phoumsavan  (No. 2), Gen. Khamtai Siphandon (No. 3), Phoun Sipaseut (No. 4),  Saman Vi-gnaket (No. 6) Lieutenant General Choummali Sai-ngason  (No. 8), and Kamphoui Keoboualapha (No. 10), as well as the late  Kaysone Phomvihan (No. 1), and the late Somlat Chanthamat (No.  9).    Maichantan Sengmani (No. 5), Oudom Khatthi-gna (No. 7), and  Thongsing Thammavong (No. 11) are the three northerners  appointed to the present Political Bureau.    The photos from the signing ceremony of the agreement on  developing the Khon Phapheng Resort (Liphi Waterfall) between  Khamphoui Keoboualapha on behalf of the Commission for Planning  and Foreign Cooperation and Khun Somphop Piya-ui of T.U. Company  Ltd tells the inside story of Laos' politics and economy.  Everyone knows that the area to be developed is the home town  of General Khamtai Siphandon.    Khong District of the Kha ethnic group has a long record of  struggling for national liberation. The Kha people under the  command of their chieftain Kommadan rose up against French  colonialist rule and later the chieftain's son, Sithon Kommadan,  led his people to join other minority groups in the struggle for  national liberation.    General Khamtai Siphandon was born in a farming family in  Houa Khong village. Like other youths in those days, he joined  the revolutionary movement in Champassak Province by becoming a  member of the Indochina Party (the first Marxist-Leninist  Communist Party established by Ho Chi Minh in the region) and  later shifted to the LPRP.    During the war against the U.S. imperialists, the name of  Khamtai Siphandon was always mentioned after those of Kaysone  Phomvihan and Nouhak Phoumsavan.    Immediately after the formation of the first government of  the LPDR, Gen. Khamtai Siphandon was appointed deputy prime  minister, defense minister, and supreme commander of the Lao  Armed Forces.    Afterwards, he fully controlled power in the Lao People's  Army until recently handing this power to Lieutenant General  Choummali Sai-gnason.    Gen. Khamtai Siphandon took up the presidency during a time  when Laos is being bombarded by the strong currents of  capitalism. The party leader, a competent warrior on any  battlefield, realizes the fact that "economic war is different  from bloody political war." So he prudently rearranged his Army  by posing "new-headed youths" as his front commanders to fight  on the globalization battlefield.    In so doing, he appointed Somsavat Lengsavat, an  international relations graduate from the United States, as the  foreign minister of his government. Khamsai Souphanouvong, a  son of the revolutionary prince who was an economics graduate  who studied in France, was named finance minister. Sompadit  Vorasan, an economist who studied in France, was appointed to be  trade minister; and Butsabong Suvannavong, a finance and banking  expert from England, became governor of the State Bank.    Political observers in Laos anticipate that a cabinet  reshuffle will take place soon. President Nouhak Phoumsavan,  78, will retire from politics and be replaced by Gen. Khamtai  Siphandon, 66.    It is generally believed Defense Minister Lt. Gen. Choummali  Sai- gnason will become the new prime minister and the post of  defense minister will be given to General Sisavat Keobounphan,  who was not appointed to the party's Political Bureau by the  fifth party congress.    However, this speculation is based on the compromise between  the northerners and southerners which is designed to keep the  national economic development scheme moving ahead in line with  the principle of "daring to accept capitalism, but not be  enslaved by capitalism."    The directions of Laos' politics and economy from now on  will  be controlled by Gen. Khamtai Siphandon and his six southern  compatriots in the party's Political Bureau.    This is the Lao People's Democratic Republic under the rule  of "southerners."</p>

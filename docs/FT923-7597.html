			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Solvency ratio debate starts hotting up - The reaction to Royal Insurance's restructuring move THE DEBATE within the insurance industry about the value of the solvency ratio, one of the principal tools used to measure the financial strength of non-life insurance companies, is set to hot up following a sharp rise in Royal Insurance's ratio after its restructuring last week. Royal announced on Thursday that it was transferring ownership of its life insurance subsidiary from the general insurance sub-holding to the parent non-insurance holding company. This released funds of Pounds 547m and allowed the general insurance business to liquidate debt and financed an increase in its net assets. Although at group level the overall asset and liability position remained unchanged, Royal said the solvency ratio - net assets as a percentage of non-life premium income - of its general insurance business had increased from under 30 to a comfortable 40 per cent. The move was criticised as 'cosmetic' by some analysts. Mr Stephen Bird, of Smith New Court, the securities house, points out that it means Royal is now presenting its solvency on a different basis to other companies in the sector. More generally, after recent losses and declines in asset values have eaten into the industry's strength and increased the need for closer scrutiny, analysts are beginning to question the value of the indicator. The logic of the solvency ratio seems straightforward enough. The stronger a company's capital base the less chance there is of it being unable to pay insurance claims, and the more insurance policies it can sell. The volume of premium income acts as a kind of proxy for the scale of risk being assumed. But the ratio has a number of shortcomings. For a start, the definition of what constitutes an adequate ratio varies widely. Industry regulators insist on a minimum of between 16 and 18 per cent, but are likely to press for corrective action long before this point is reached. The market - insurance brokers, analysts and investors in insurance companies - has gradually become less conservative about the level it regards as adequate. During the 1970s, a ratio of less than 50 per cent was considered worrying. More recently the level of acceptability has fallen to as low as 30 per cent. 'There's been a general recognition that from a shareholder's point of view too much solvency can depress your rate of return on capital,' says an executive with one leading UK insurer. 'It is a moving target to some extent,' says Mr Youssef Zaia of Morgan Stanley, another securities house. Regulatory and market assessments of the assets that can be taken into account for the calculation vary. UK regulators insist on a very precise and complex definition of admissible assets, with limits on particular categories of assets. For example, if an insurance company had invested a quarter of its assets in one single company, for solvency purposes it would only be able to take into account a proportion of these. Regulators are also only interested in the business conducted by the operating insurance company. By contrast in assessing their own solvency, companies may include assets held at group level. Commercial Union takes the value of its extensive life insurance businesses outside the UK, including those registered in the name of its large Dutch subsidiary, Delta Lloyd. It also brings the value of a UK 'non participating' life assurance fund into the picture, which contributes a further Pounds 90m to net assets and boosts solvency to 42.5 per cent. By including the value of the life business which it has 'sold' to its group holding company, Royal too has converted its life business into an asset for its general insurance business. On the other hand Sun Alliance, the strongest insurer (with a ratio in the mid-fifties according to analysts), Guardian Royal Exchange (about 40 per cent) and General Accident (38 per cent) do not include extensive life insurance businesses when they make calculations. The ratio has also been criticised because it fails to adequately indicate the real level of risk a company is running. Companies can, in effect, be penalised for taking measures to reduce risk. All other things being equal, an increase in premium rates, for example, will lead to higher premium income and a drop in the solvency ratio. On the other hand a company cutting premiums to win market share might be insuring more risks for the same premium income. This increase of risk would, however, not be reflected in a falling solvency margin. The measure also fails to differentiate between classes of risk on an insurer's books. The risks incurred in insuring a motor car are much less than those in insuring an oil rig, for example. Yet Pounds 1 of premium earned from either policy counts for exactly the same in the solvency calculation. 'It is a very wide measure that doesn't take into account different risk exposures,' says Mr Paul Found of Commercial Union.</p>

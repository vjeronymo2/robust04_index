			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Cambodia's top parties to share power THE TWO main Cambodian political parties yesterday agreed on a form of interim government under which they will share power while a new constitution is being written. Prince Norodom Ranariddh, head of the royalist party Funcinpec, which won most votes in elections last month, and Mr Hun Sen, until now prime minister in the Phnom Penh government, will be joint presidents. The two spent most of the election campaign making personal attacks on each other. The agreement was proposed by Prince Ranariddh's father, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who resigned from Funcinpec two years ago to become the neutral head of state. It has still to be ratified by the elected assembly, but the two parties hold most of the seats in the assembly and approval should be a formality. Until now, Prince Ranariddh had said he would not work with Mr Hun Sen, whom he says is an unreformed communist who has ordered the killing of dozens of Funcinpec members. Mr Hun Sen's political star has risen sharply in the past days after a poor election performance. He is being credited with having defused an attempt to set up an autonomous zone in eastern Cambodia. The announcement of an interim government comes two days after the new assembly met for the first time and voted to give undefined and unlimited powers to Prince Sihanouk. However, according to a statement released by the royal palace last night, Prince Sihanouk will have no official role in the new government. Nevertheless, the prince will preside over weekly meetings of the council of ministers held in the palace. Diplomats in Cambodia believe that will give him every opportunity to influence government policy.</p>

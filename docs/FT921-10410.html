			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Gold closed lower on the London bullion market in generally dull trading. Dealers saw little incentive for the market to break out of the Dollars 354 to Dollars 360 a troy ounce range ahead of next week's Comex options expiry. Platinum eased as light profit taking emerged after this week's gains. London cocoa prices dipped to fresh five-month lows in early trading before recovering some of the losses. 'We've seen fund selling, although there was some very scattered industry buying in the nearbys,' said one dealer. In New York orange juice futures were sharply lower at midday. 'The market is weighed down on expectations that the USDA will revise the early and midseason orange estimate upwards, on preliminary estimates the 1992-93 Brazilian orange crop will be larger than expected and on technical factors,' said one analyst. London robusta coffee prices moved ahead. Dealers said the market appeared to have experienced a technical correction after being oversold recently, with interest focused on the March contract switching from the sterling contract to dollars. In contrast New York arabicas were at new lows by midday. Analysts said renewed pressure reflected bearish sentiment toward both fundamental and technical factors.</p>

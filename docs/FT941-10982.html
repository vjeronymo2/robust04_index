			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: HSBC Holdings There is something perplexing about the sharp rise of HSBC Holdings, especially in the light of Friday's tightening by the US Federal Reserve. Its shares gained 14 per cent last week alone, with much of the driving force coming from Hong Kong, a market where it has tended to under perform recently. The reasons must lie deeper than good figures from both its US and Australian subsidiaries, which make up only a small proportion of its total business. Yet there are grounds to expect the bank's growth in Hong Kong to slow. At some stage provisions, which have been negligible in the Asia-Pacific region, will start to rise again as the Hong Kong property market cools off. The attraction to the Hong Kong investor may be that HSBC is insulated by its ownership of Midland as well as by the relative quality of its local loan book. Its out-performance in that market could then reflect the idea that more parochial alternatives are becoming relatively more risky as the cycle peaks. But the view from the UK should be different. The impact of the UK recovery should be more strongly felt in the profits of other clearing banks such as Barclays and National Westminster with a more domestic orientation. Admittedly, consensus forecast earnings of around 74p per share this year do not make a share price of Pounds 10.99 look particularly expensive. The big uncertainty, though, is how the Hong Kong market will react to the Fed's move when the dust settles. Its small tightening might make little difference, either to US investment flows or to the territory's economy. But as a bank operating in a market whose currency is linked to the US dollar, HSBC is sensitive to US interest rates.</p>

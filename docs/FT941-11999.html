			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / International Equity Issues: No change in prospects for conversion in Taiwan - The government is divided over the pace and scope of financial liberalisation More than four years after Yuen Foong Yu Paper became the first Taiwanese company to tap the Euromarket in convertible bonds - via a Dollars 100m, 10-year issue - prospects for conversion into equity appear as dim as ever. This has not dissuaded international investors, keen for any sort of exposure to Taiwan's fast-growing economy. So difficult is it to buy into Taiwan'sequity market that even the vaguest promises of direct access is enough to tempt fund managers. Neither has it kept Taiwan companies from raising convertible debt. Since YFY's issue in 1989, local companies have issued Dollars 515m and SFr210m in 'convertible' Eurobonds. Three Euroconvertible issues were launched in last month alone. At least 10 other companies have applications pending. Last October, Taiwan's central bank agreed to allow the conversion of convertible bonds issued overseas, provided the cabinet approved the plan. Themeasure was also subject to the US Securities and Exchange Commission's revision of regulations related to overseas issuance of corporate bonds. Analysts say that given the web of controls surrounding foreign investment in Taiwan's stock market, the subject of convertibility poses a myriad trick questions for regulators. To begin with, only foreign institutional investors (FIIs) approved by the central bank may invest directly in local shares: foreign individuals are not allowed to buy Taiwan shares. As Euroconvertibles are traded over-the-counter in the Eurobond market, the central bank has no control over who owns them. The central bank's October statement suggested that bonds held by foreign individuals could be converted into global depository receipts. However, todate just four Taiwan firms have issued GDRs, certificates listed on overseas stock exchanges equivalent to shares in the issuing company. None of the Euroconvertible issuers has done so. Conversion also comes into conflict with restrictions on foreign ownership of local shares. The government imposes an overall ceiling of Dollars 5bn on total foreign funds which may be brought into the country to invest in Taiwan shares. There is also a Dollars 200m ceiling per approved FII, a limit of 10 per cent on total foreign ownership in the shares in issue of a particular stock and a 5 per cent limit on ownership by any individual FII. Deep discord within the government over the pace and scope of financial liberalisation ensures that in spite longstanding promises to loosen significantly restrictions on foreign investment in Taiwan's bourse, in line with plans to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, such measures are unlikely to happen soon. Meanwhile, investors can either hold bonds for the fixed return or profit by trading them. Taiwan share prices are currently viewed as undervalued relative to other regional equity markets. For issuers, Euroconvertibles represent cheaper financing than they could obtain at home. Last month's issues carried coupons of 2 per cent, compared with rates of around 8 per cent in the domestic market. Taiwan's lack of an established rating system for corporatedebt has made it difficult for all but big companies to raise funds locally. This appears to be a concern for investors in Taiwanese Euroconvertibles, in spite of the fact that the local companies are largely unknown quantities abroad. Even medium-sized companies are considering issuing overseas - especially in Switzerland, where rates and costs associated with issuance are lowest. Given the plethora of issues set to enter the Eurobond markets and the snail-like pace of reform, Taiwan's curious unconvertible convertible bonds are likely to remain a fixture of the financial landscape for some time to come.</p>

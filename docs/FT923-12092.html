			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Spain takes the lead in headless commonwealth: Madrid's Ibero-American summit FOR A former colonial power as desperate as Spain is to find a place for itself in the community of nations it helped to form, the second Ibero-American summit could not have had a more appropriate launch: the biggest single foreign investment it has been able to attract in a decade has come from Mexico. Cementos Mexicanos (Cemex) announced two weeks ago that it was to spend Dollars 1.25bn (Pounds 650m) buying the pride of the Spanish cement business, Valenciana, and yesterday agreed to pay a further Dollars 600m for the second-biggest Spanish producer, Sanson. Montezuma's revenge? Not exactly but, in reaching out to its former colonies, democratic Spain has found them to be much harder going than the conquistadors did. Latin Americans are often richer, smarter and prouder than Spaniards like to regard them as being. At the summit, which is to start in Madrid on Thursday, Spain will be sitting down with equals, just as it was at pains to do last year in Mexico with the leaders of 23 Latin American countries and Portugal. But that Guadalajara summit was a test simply of Ibero-American will to sit around a table together. The one in Madrid will try to do something. For Spain, concrete achievement is crucial. Even after more than a decade of democracy, Spain has just over 3 per cent of its trade with its former American colonies and cannot even claim to have been hurt much by the Latin American debt crises - Spanish banks cut and ran from South America long before the region's debts did them much damage. However, Madrid, for reasons of pride more than anything, has been trying in the past few years to compete for Latin American favour. It has opened credit lines worth nearly Dollars 10bn to Argentina, Mexico and Venezuela. Spanish state-controlled industries have been ordered to buy into privatised airlines, telephone and electrical utilities. Madrid has been trying to tout itself as Latin America's bridge into the European Community. So far, all with mixed results. Many credit lines have not been used. In Argentina, Iberia, Spain's state-owned airline is accused of mis-managing Aerolneas Argentinas, which it bought last year, and EC aid to the region, not included in the Community's APC (Africa-Pacific-Caribbean) agreement, is little more than a trickle. As Mexico's free trade agreement with the US and Canada develops, some Spanish businessmen believe they have more to gain by investing there than by selling Spain as an economic starter-motor. Still, the summits would probably not be happening were they not being so pursued by Madrid. It is just that 'we have to be the engine but we don't want to be the whole train,' according to Mr Innocencio Arias, the Spanish deputy foreign minister, in a recent interview. The politics are complicated - anything that smacks of Spanish imperialism would ruin what is an effort to create a headless commonwealth. The summit targets are, thus, modest and even imprecise. The creation of a daily educative television channel, using Spain's Hispasat satellite once it is launched, a post-graduate exchange programme, an environmental fund and one for indigenous peoples head the list. Funding has not been decided and Spain might be landed with the lion's share, simply to keep up momentum. Mr Felipe Gonzalez, Spanish prime minister, whose personal prestige in Latin America has grown out of all proportion to his ability to deliver EC aid or to soften US attitudes to some Latin American leaders, would probably be prepared to pay dearly to keep the Ibero-American idea alive. He has at least been able to sell democracy in Latin America by pointing to Spain's economic growth in the three years after it joined the EC in 1986. But the suspension of the constitution in Peru and the attempted coup in Venezuela this year badly bruised Madrid's fond hopes that this summit would also be a celebration of democracy finally taking root in Latin America. President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela will not be in Madrid and the summit might be stolen by President Fidel Castro of Cuba, whose elections are somewhat different. This will be his first visit to Spain and its province of Galicia, where his father was born. Spain is sentimental about its emigrants to Latin America and Mr Castro would be treated as a celebrity in most of the country. He is not, though, quite the model Ibero-American whom Madrid has been trying to nurture. Cemex purchase, page 20.</p>

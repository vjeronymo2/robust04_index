			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Anis Yahya, "speaker of the South Yemen </F> parliament," by Sawsan Abu-Husayn in Cairo; date not given]    [Excerpt] [Abu-Husayn] Information indicates that the  continuation of the Yemeni unity war could affect Red Sea  security and threaten international navigation. Is Aden taking  account of this?    [Yahya] Aden is complying with the cease-fire, and it is  demanding day and night that the fighting be halted, because its  continuation would inevitably affect Red Sea security and safety  in the long term. Nevertheless, Aden has huge capabilities and  an advanced naval force. But there is a need to coordinate  efforts at the Arab and international levels to stop the war.  Aden is standing fast and has the ability to stand fast for a  long time. But the war's effects on neighboring states and the  Arab region will be devastating.    [Abu-Husayn] But UN envoy Lakhdar Brahimi spoke at the end  of  his tour of progress vis-a-vis the work of the committee  supervising the cease-fire.    [Yahya] That is true. But we regret to say that Sanaa has  denied Brahimi's statement and its acceptance of Aden's proposal  regarding the work of that committee. Sanaa wants to revive the  joint committee formed before the war which comprised Jordan,  the Sultanate of Oman, and observers from the U.S. and French  Embassies -- which we do not accept, because there is fighting  going on now and its dangers are great, and it needs more  intervention from the United Nations by way of adopting a strong  resolution to compel Sanaa to halt the fighting.    [Abu-Husayn] Let us ask you about statements made yesterday  by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his agreement to hold a  dialogue with southern leaders but in the framework of the  Yemeni Constitution: Do you accept that?    [Yahya] Yes, we welcome dialogue with president 'Ali Salih  but in the framework of the constitution of the Democratic  Republic of Yemen and the Pledge and Accord Document, which we  consider a constitution for all the institutions of our new  state, "the Republic of Yemen" [Jumhuriyat al-Yaman] [sentence  as published]. However, I doubt what President 'Ali Salih says,  because he contradicts himself every five minutes here and there.    I think that Sanaa is trying to get around Security Council  Resolution 924 lest a new resolution is adopted against it after  Lakhdar Brahimi submits his report. Nevertheless, we demand  that the Security Council be convened again as soon as possible  to work to implement its resolution. [passage omitted]</p>

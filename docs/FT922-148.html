			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Restructuring costs push Lovell into red YJ LOVELL Holdings yesterday showed the darker side of UK construction and housebuilding after Berkeley Group's sparkling results, writes Andrew Taylor. The group, which at the beginning of this year had to renegotiate its banking facilities, incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.49m during the six months to end-March. The losses included exceptional provisions of Pounds 2.37m to cover the legal and professional costs of restructuring its finances and redundancy arrangements. The agreement with the banks runs until December when the group will needto renew or renegotiatea new deal over loan arrangements. Mr Robert Sellier, chief executive, said yesterday that the company had kept within the terms of the agreement negotiated in January and had managed to fund interest payments out of cash flow without recourse to further borrowing. Mr Antony Hichens, chairman, said: 'We could say that we are no longer a stretcher case but are among the walking wounded.' Group debt, including off-balance sheet financing, was 10 per cent lower than at the corresponding stage although still higher than the Pounds 111.4m announced in September. Lovell had hoped that debts would have been lower by this stage but sales of properties were taking longer than had been expected. The group, which made losses per share of 1.8p against restated earnings of 1.9p last time, said that there was still no sign of any improvement in the housing and commercial property market despite a brief flurry of interest in house sales immediately after the general election. During the period under review the housing and commercial property division made a loss of Pounds 1.13m (Pounds 1.14m loss). The construction division, which would have been profitable but for a near Pounds 1.5m loss from plant hire, incurred an operating loss of Pounds 66,000 (Pounds 1.16m profit). COMMENT The question analysts were asking themselves yesterday was not what level of losses Lovell might make this year but whether it will generate sufficient cash from its hard pressed divisions to keep the bankers at bay and ensure its survival. Contracting should continue to generate cash although less than previously. Plant hire, the group says, is broadly cash neutral although losses seem likely to continue. The US housing investments have also reached the stage where they are starting to generate a cash return. That leaves the British housing and commercial property division where the group needs badly to generate sales. Shareholders with nowhere to bail out have no choice but to stick with it even though losses this year could be anywhere between Pounds 1m and Pounds 5m.</p>

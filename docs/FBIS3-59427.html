			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Nobody Counts on the Survival of </F> Bosnia"]    [Text] Zagreb (TANJUG) -- Croatian President Franjo Tudjman  stated on Friday, in a conversation with Croatian  Radio-Television journalists, that "nobody any longer counts on  Bosnia and Herzegovina to survive as one country."    "Those powers in international politics which have decisive  influence on the formation of international order believe that  order on the territory of the former Yugoslavia can presently be  established in contact with Serbia and Croatia as well as the  other countries which came into being there," added Tudjman.    Tudjman pointed out that "Europe and the world have finally  realized that the Muslims are not just a `victim'" but that they  have turned against the Croats, and now "they carry out  aggressive raids and threaten the very physical survival of the  Croats."    When he was asked to evaluate the criticism emerging from  the  conservative ranks of the Croatian opposition regarding his  dialogues with Slobodan Milosevic, the Croatian president said  that even all of European and the world authorities have spoken  with him and that "he is the only politician with authority in  today's Serbia and the only one with whom to talk."    On the subject of Krajina, the Croatian president stressed  that he is definitely determined to find a peaceful solution,  that Knin and Glina counties should be given territorial  autonomy and guarantees of civil and ethnic rights along with  the right to be "completely included in the total economic and  legal systems of Croatia." However, Tudjman noted that if this  should prove to be unacceptable, Croatia would find "other  means" to resolve the issue.    He was asked whether he would offer anything else to the  Serbs, i.e., "whether he would again include them in the  Constitution of the Republic of Croatia." In response, the  Croatian president expressed his opinion that the Croatian  Constitution is "on the level of the most progressive  constitutions in the world," since it states that Croatia is a  nationalistic state, but also the state of its citizens.    The Serbs are entitled to both cultural and territorial  autonomy in the regions where they are in majority, but, as  Tudjman sees it, "there is no need for any constitutional  changes."</p>

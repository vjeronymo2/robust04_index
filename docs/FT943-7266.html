			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / VW's gloom hits car shares Mr Ferdinand Piech, Volkswagen chairman, was yesterday accused of playing 'malicious tricks' on his competitors after his gloomy views on market prospects hit German car shares yesterday. VW stock suffered most, slumping 4.3 per cent, after Mr Piech said on Monday evening that the industry's west European sales would be unchanged from last year's low of 11.3m. His remarks to journalists, combined with official data published yesterday showing German car registrations down 16 per cent in July, and 4.9 per cent lower than a year earlier, rattled the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. VW shares tumbled DM21.50 to DM483 at the official close: BMW shares dropped 1.7 per cent, or DM14, while Daimler-Benz fell 1.4 per cent, or DM11.50. The decline in car stocks was the main cause of a 0.75 per cent dip in the Dax index of 30 leading shares. One industry official claimed the VW chairman was basing his assessment of industry prospects on those at VW. 'He thinks VW is the automotive industry and he is presenting his own poor orders as representative of the whole sector. It is malicious trick,' he said. Analysts said Mr Piech might be attempting to damp profit expectations after VW's interim report last week announced the long-awaited turnround had been achieved. The group earned DM133m (Pounds 55m) net in the second quarter, reducing the first-half loss to DM209m against DM1.6bn in 1993. While Mr Piech's forecast of unchanged German sales this year matched the industry consensus, his suggestion of a flat result throughout western Europe was 'completely out of line', according to one analyst. General Motors Europe stood by earlier forecasts that German demand for all makes of cars would be unchanged at 3.2m cars, while west European sales would rise around 700,000 to 12m cars this year. BMW said July deliveries, orders and production were all higher than a year earlier, while Mercedes-Benz said its plans to deliver 585,000 vehicles to all markets remained unchanged.

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Tokyo, May 16 KYODO -- The schedule for the July  summit of the Group of Seven (G-7) economic powers in Naples has  now taken shape, Foreign Ministry sources said Monday [16 May].    The sources said that according to a provisional schedule  worked out among the sherpas, or the personal representatives of  the G-7 leaders, the summit leaders will begin their dialogue  with a working dinner on the evening of July 8.    The leaders will consider economic issues in a formal  session  on July 9, a day which will also see the release of an economic  declaration, as well as separate meetings among the foreign  ministers and the finance ministers of the G-7.    Russian President Boris Yeltsin will make his first  appearance at the Naples summit on the evening of July 9, when  he attends a banquet.    On July 10, Yeltsin will join in political deliberations  among the G-7 leaders on specific topics such as the former  Yugoslavia, the Middle East and Eastern Europe. But the sources  said there remain other topics to be discussed only among the  G-7 countries themselves.    Later in the day, the G-7 countries will issue a chairman's  summary and a political declaration. Along with Russia, the  economic powers will also issue a political statement regarding  the former Yugoslavia.    In the case of previous summits, the Kremlin leader only  joined the G-7 leaders after their talks were already finished  for a special "G-7-plus-one" session. [passage omitted]</p>

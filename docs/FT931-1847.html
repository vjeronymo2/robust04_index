			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Doubts over costs of council reform MR IAN LANG, Scottish secretary, said yesterday the savings that could be made by reforming the structure of local government in Scotland may have been miscalculated. It is understood that some estimates of possible savings, made by Touche Ross for the Scottish Office and published in a green paper in October, may be too high, and some estimates of the cost of transition may be too low. The green paper proposed a move from the existing nine regional councils, 53 district councils and three unitary island councils to a single-tier structure.</p>

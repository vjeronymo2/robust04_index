			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / International Company News: Most of Japan's leading brokers end year in red LEADING Japanese securities houses yesterday revealed worse than expected results, with 12 of the largest 14 houses reporting after-tax losses for the year ended March 1992, and all cautious in their predictions for the current year. Of the Big Four houses, only Nomura Securities reported an after-tax profit, while two others, Daiwa Securities and Nikko Securities, reported sharply lower pre-tax profits and after-tax losses. Yamaichi Securities made a pre-tax loss of Y36.5bn (Dollars 28m), a turnround from profits of Y67.6bn in 1990-91. The houses, most of which are cutting their dividends, blamed the poor results on falling stock prices, low stock-market turnover, and the costs and consequences of the financial scandals of the past year. The 10 second-tier companies fared even worse. Nine announced pre-tax losses with Kankaku Securities hit hardest with a loss of Y49.5bn. The results have raised doubts about the ability of some second-tier brokers to survive without a lowering of ambitions and a restructuring of their operations. from stock brokerage commissions was down 44 per cent and the value of its share underwriting fell 28 per cent, while bond underwriting fell 15 per cent, interest and dividend income was down 44 per cent, and there was a 67 per cent fall in trading gains. The difficult conditions forced Nomura to draw heavily on its cash holdings, which fell from Y821.4bn to Y429.6bn. The same pattern was evident among other leading brokers, as Nikko's cash holdings were more than halved to Y352bn, and those of Daiwa were down 33 per cent to Y856bn. Damage is even greater at the second-tier brokers, with Yamatane Securities formally announcing a financial action plan in the wake of a Y25.4bn after-tax loss. The company, along with Cosmo Securities, was forced to pay compensation to settle disputes with clients over tobashi  - the shuffling of stocks from account to account to avoid the booking of losses. Yamatane is seeking interest rate cuts from its leading banks, while other second-tier companies are closing unprofitable domestic and foreign offices, and cutting their staff intake. Sanyo Securities, which reported a pre-tax loss of Y29.6bn, said yesterday that officies in Madrid, Milan and Toronto will be closed next month. The collapse of the market was reflected in large losses seen on the brokers' own securities dealings, with Yamaichi announcing a Y36.9bn loss in stock dealings, Daiwa a Y19.4bn loss, and Kankaku an Y11.8bn loss. Of the Big Four brokers, only Nomura will keep its dividend unchanged at Y15 a share, while Daiwa will cut its payout from Y14 to Y9, Nikko from Y13.5 to Y8.5, and Yamaichi from Y13.5 to Y7.5.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                    RESULTS OF THE BIG FOUR BROKERS                     (year ended March 1992 in Ybn)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                      Operating       Pre-tax       After-tax                       income       profit/loss     profit/loss  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Nomura             421.7 (688.3)   44.1 (233.5)    31.6 (105.5) Daiwa              321.1 (477.4)    9.3 (119.3)   -43.5  (59.5) Nikko              287.9 (376.6)    3.1  (72.9)   -25.9  (39.7) Yamaichi           231.4 (360.2)  -36.5  (67.5)   -53.2  (38.6)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL APPROVES ETHICS PACKAGE TIED TO PAY RAISES  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday passed a sweeping ethics reform package  that revives a proposal to establish public financing of local political  campaigns but ties the reforms to pay raises for the council and other elected  officials.  </P> <P> The council pay raises, approved by a 10-4 margin, are $8,187 larger than those  proposed three weeks ago.  </P> <P> Council salaries would rise by $32,822, or 53%, bringing members' annual pay to  $94,344, the level of Superior Court judges. The mayor would get a $20,110  raise, bringing his salary to $122,647.  </P> <P> The council voted to provide city matching funds to political candidates but  placed an $8-million limit on the amount that could be spent over four years.  Providing unlimited public financing could have cost taxpayers $27 million,  according to city estimates.  </P> <P> The proposed pay raise, public campaign financing and ethics reforms will be  linked in a single ballot measure in June, meaning that voters must grant  elected officials the pay raise if they want to adopt the reforms.  </P> <P> Several council members said that voter sentiment against the pay raises will  be so strong that the entire package will go down to defeat. As originally  envisioned, the ethics reforms would have been split into several ballot  measures, none calling for pay raises.  </P> <P> "I think that we accomplished absolutely nothing," Councilwoman Gloria Molina  said of Tuesday's action. "You're not giving the options to the voters. You've  linked everything together, and I think what you have done is dismantle any  attempt at . . . ethics . . . and campaign reform by adding a $30,000 salary  increase to the members of the City Council.  </P> <P> "It makes the statement, 'I will be honest if you pay me enough,' " said  Molina, who opposed making the pay raise part of the package.  </P> <P> Some council members may have voted for the pay increases as a way to  indirectly defeat other parts of the package that they oppose.  </P> <P> Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, a foe of public campaign financing, voted for the  pay raises even though he says he opposes them. "I think it makes the whole  package more vulnerable," Yaroslavsky said in an interview. He said he favors  the other ethics reforms.  </P> <P> The sponsors of the broad-ranging package pronounced themselves satisfied with  the results Tuesday.  </P> <P> Councilman Michael Woo, who has been shepherding the measures through the  council, said key provisions of the package were restored.  </P> <P> Through a frenzy of amendments three weeks ago, the council had thrown out the  public financing provision and had inserted numerous exceptions to proposed  bans on outside work, gifts and honorariums. Under the new proposal, the  council reinstated the ban on all outside work and honorariums but allowed  elected officials to accept certain gifts.  </P> <P> The result comes close to the compromise worked out in mid-January between Woo  and Geoffrey Cowan, head of an ethics-in-government commission appointed by  Mayor Tom Bradley one day after his narrow election victory last spring.  </P> <P> Questions about Bradley's personal finances began to emerge a year ago and are  at the heart of the renewed interest in ethics reform that led to passage of  Tuesday's package.  </P> <P> Cowan and several citizens groups had threatened to place a citizens initiative  on the November ballot if the council did not pass an ethics package that  contained the major provisions of the commission's proposals.  </P> <P> Cowan called the reforms as they now stand "probably the most comprehensive in  the nation."  </P> <P> "In many respects, it's probably the toughest in the nation," he said.  </P> <P> Cowan said that a citizens initiative is now unlikely, but that the paper work  for a ballot measure will be filed this week as insurance against the council  changing its mind.  </P> <P> The ethics package will be sent back to the council next month for approval of  ballot language drafted by the city attorney's office.  </P> <P> "Technically, it's another opportunity for the council to tinker with the  package," Woo said.  </P> <P> Woo called the council action "a real accomplishment" because a majority of  members voted to ban outside employment and honorariums, and to put public  financing and expenditure limits on the ballot. The council showed a  "commitment to at least give the voters a chance to enact meaningful campaign  finance reform," said Woo, who voted to include the pay raises.  </P> <P> The reforms hit an unexpected snag Tuesday when representatives of the city  attorney's office issued an opinion saying that the council cannot make the new  ethics code apply to city employees who are members of unions without running  afoul of labor contracts. As a result, the council made the proposed new code  applicable only to elected officials.  </P> <P> The council will attempt to devise ethics guidelines for administrators and  others in policy-making positions at a later time, Woo said.  </P> <P> The pay raise was the most politically troublesome feature of the package  approved Tuesday, and Councilman Richard Alatorre was one of the few who spoke  out in favor of it.  </P> <P> "I do not see anything wrong with linking public financing, salaries and an  ethics package," Alatorre said. "I don't believe that we are paid adequately  for the work that we do. . . . I believe we are worth it."  </P> <P> Councilman Joel Wachs, who had objected to a number of the provisions banning  outside income, said he could support the ban if the proposed pay raises were  increased.  </P> <P> The council then approved Wachs' motion to link council members' pay to that of  Superior Court judges rather than Municipal Court judges, who make $8,000 a  year less.  </P> <P> In addition to Molina, council members Marvin Braude, Joy Picus and Joan Milke  Flores voted against the raise. Councilwoman Ruth Galanter was not present.  </P> <P> Under the proposal, the mayor's salary would be 30% higher than that of  Superior Court judges. But Bradley said in a letter to the council on Monday  that he objects to linking ethics reforms and pay raises and would give his  raise to charity.  </P> <P> Woo said Bradley could use his veto power to remove the measure from the June  ballot but that he could not single out particular issues, such as the ethics  reform proposal. His office had no comment Tuesday on whether he might take  such action.  </P></p>

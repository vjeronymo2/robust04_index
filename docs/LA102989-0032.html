			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC SPECIAL;  </P> <P> THE RECORD INDUSTRY'S BIG PUSH  </P> <P> The fall season is always the most active time for pop record releases, as the  music industry gears up for its November-December season, during which nearly a  third of all records, tapes and CDs are sold. But that can mean confusion for  even the most serious music fans, as old favorites compete with newcomers for  consumers' attention.  </P> <P>  These are the albums expected to generate the most critical and commercial  interest of all the post-Labor Day releases during the hectic year-end rush.  The selections, presented in alphabetical order, cover all parts of the pop  music spectrum, from heavy-metal fathers (Aerosmith) and sons (L.A. Guns) to  rap innovators (the D.O.C., Young M.C.); from rock kings on the rebound (Bob  Dylan, the Rolling Stones) and pop queens living the lush life (Linda Ronstadt,  Barbra Streisand) to country chartbusters (Randy Travis) and folkie mavericks  (Tracy Chapman, Michelle Shocked).  </P> <P>  The comments are by the Times pop writers indicated, but the star ratings (one  is poor, five a classic) sometimes reflect additional pop staff input.  </P> <P>  The reviewers are Robert Hilburn, Dennis Hunt, Mike Boehm, Richard Cromelin,  Jonathan Gold, Steve Hochman, Connie Johnson, Craig Lee, Kristine McKenna,  Randy Lewis, Don Snowden, Chris Willman, Paul Grein, Duff Marlowe and Don  Waller.  </P> <P> *** HEAVY D. &amp; THE BOYZ, "Big Tyme,"Uptown/MCA. "Big Tyme" is a new style  of rap album, achieving a fine balance of deft beats, heavy attitude, funky  lyrics and catchy melodies. There are the usual quota of James-Brown inspired  soul grooves, but Heavy D., the self-described overweight lover, stretches out  too, raiding the heavy funk file with a vengeance. (Marlowe)  </P> <P> **** SOUL II SOUL, "Keep On Movin',"Virgin. This diverse alliance of female  vocalists, deejays and musicians borrows beats from the mellow side of New York  hip-hop and adds string backing in lieu of standard R&amp;B horns, arriving at  a natural, uncontrived sound with strong reggae and African influences. A  bright, cheery and appealingly innovative debut. (Marlowe)  </P> <P> </P> <P> Coming Up:  </P> <P> Other albums scheduled for release in the coming weeks include:  </P> <P> ABC, Art of Noise, Basia, Bobby Brown (dance mixes), Club Nouveau, Phil  Collins, Erasure, Gipsy Kings, Ofra Haza, the Jesus and Mary Chain, Joan Jett,  Quincy Jones, Kid Creole, Kris Kristofferson, Yngwie Malsteem, Roches,  Shinehead, Keith Sweat, Tiffany, the Time, Jody Watley (dance mixes),  Whitesnake and Peter Wolf.  </P></p>

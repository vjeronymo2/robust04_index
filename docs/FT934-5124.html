			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Cut of Pounds 60m brings harmony closer - Scottish non-domestic rates Scottish businesses are to have their total non-domestic rates bill cut by a further Pounds 60m as a result of the Budget, as part of the policy of gradually harmonising non-domestic rates in Scotland with the uniform business rate in England and Wales. The process entails reducing Scotland's higher levels of business rates to the lower English levels and has been going on since 1989. It involves periodic injections of money from the Scottish Office to offset the revenue which local authorities would otherwise forego with the lower rates income. In Scotland the Scottish secretary sets each council's non-domestic rates poundage. Since 1989 the non-domestic rates burden in Scotland has been reduced by Pounds 500m. With yesterday's announcement, four more of Scotland's 65 councils will join the three whose rates had already fallen to English levels. The gap remaining to be filled after the Budget comes into effect should be about Pounds 70m. Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, said yesterday that he was contributing Pounds 47.5m of the Pounds 60m reduction to the councils. They will be expected to save Pounds 12.5m through efficiency measures to achieve the Pounds 60m reduction for the rate payers. Mr Lang said yesterday's reduction in rate poundages was Pounds 10m greater than it would otherwise have been, thanks to Scotland's Pounds 10m share of the overall reduction in business rates announced by Mr Clarke in the Budget.</p>

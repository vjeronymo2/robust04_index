			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Airlines replace engine fuse pins BRITISH Airways and Virgin Atlantic, the two UK operators of Boeing 747 aircraft, have decided to replace the fuse pins securing the engines of their 747 fleets after each jumbo has made 3,000 landings, Paul Betts writes. The move follows a recommendation from Boeing yesterday to all 747 operators to conduct additional inspections of fuse pins and engine struts. The failure of fuse pins caused by metal fatigue and corrosion is regarded by accident investigators as probably the main cause of the Amsterdam disaster last month, when an El Al 747 cargo aircraft crashed into a housing complex after losing two engines shortly after take-off. After an initial inspection Boeing said it found very few cases of cracked fuse pins. Mr Jim Johnson, vice president of Boeing's 747 division said: 'All these have been replaced.' He added that about 20 per cent of pins inspected had enough corrosion to warrant replacement. The US Federal Aviation Authority is expected to issue a directive soon requiring mandatory inspections and replacement of pins on 747 aircraft. Boeing recommended yesterday that 747 operators perform visual and ultra-sonic inspections of fuse pins after 3,000 landings or after more than three years of service. But both BA and Virgin have decided to act immediately before a mandatory directive is issued.</p>

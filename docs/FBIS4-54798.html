			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, May 4 (CTK) -- The broad cooperation of  the right-wing and center parties, as suggested by the Christian  Democrats, could lead to "revival of the creatures from Jurassic  Park" which do not belong to the Slovak politics any more,  Deputy Chairman of the NDS-NA Anton Hrnko told journalists  today. The NDS-NA (National Democratic Party-New Alternative),  led by Ludovit Cernak, splintered from the Slovak National Party  (SNS) in February. The NDS-NA has 5 deputies in the 150-member  Slovak Parliament.    "I am speaking about people who are not able to put up with  the current political situation and who still long for the old  federation (former Czechoslovakia)," Hrnko said. This could  eventually damage the Slovak right, he added.    On Saturday [30 April] the Christian Democratic Movement  (KDH) put in an offer to its potential partners regarding "the  open list of candidates up from a certain number." In addition  to the NDS-NA, the offer relates to the Democratic Party and the  Standing Conference of the Civic Institute.    A coalition after the election (scheduled for September  30-October 1) with the left-leaning parties could be considered  only "on the principles of national interest," Hrnko said,  adding that his party was ruling out cooperation with the  "authoritarian" parties, based on "principle of the personality  cult," i.e. with Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia  (HZDS) and Jan Slota's SNS.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Cyprus Government has called on the permanent  members of the UN Security Council to cooperate with the UN  secretary general's special representative in Cyprus to start  deliberations with the two sides for a new beginning with the  addition of new options.    The Cyprus Government's call is included in a series of  points submitted by Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis to the  UN secretary general and the UN Security Council members. Those  points were made public just a short while ago.    The following are noted as new options: Disarmament; the  guarantee of a future solution; and reassurance that the  Security Council can never accept negotiations for a solution  unless they are based on only one sovereignty, nationality, and  international identity. Other options noted include demographic  changes and a population census, the issue of Turkish troops in  Cyprus, and the call for Turkey to conform with Security Council  Resolution 550 and hand over the fenced area of Famagusta to the  United Nations.    In the points submitted, Foreign Minister Mikhailidhis also  notes that if the Security Council avoids proceeding in a  decisive manner to achieve a new beginning, then the message to  the Greek Cypriot side would be that it is avoiding putting the  blame where it should, failing to assume alternative measures,  not showing determination, and refraining from blaming Turkey.  The message to [Turkish Cypriot Leader] Rauf Denktas is that it  is not necessary to abandon his usual tactics and lack of  political will, since in the end they will save him and his  unacceptable stance will be tolerated.    In the points that Foreign Minister Mikhailidhis submitted,  he repeats that the Cyprus Government still accepts the 21 March  document and stresses that it has no objections to any efforts  by anyone to convince the Turkish side to accept the  confidence-building measures and ways to implement them.  Finally, the foreign minister notes that the Greek Cypriot side  believes that if the UN secretary general should give any  additional information to the Security Council, it should be  done in a verbal briefing and not in a supplementary report.  Furthermore, the foreign minister notes that if someone  believes that the confidence-building measures have a future, he  should pressure the Turkish side to accept them, and there  should be no effort to hold further talks on them.</p>

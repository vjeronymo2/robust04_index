			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE RECOMMENDS PROBATION, EXAM FOR GYNECOLOGIST  </P> <P> A Beverly Hills gynecologist, author and crusader against excess hysterectomies  "appears to be an expert of her own creation" who overcharged patients and  acted "incompetently" in some cases, a state administrative law judge has  concluded.  </P> <P> The finding, in the case of Dr. Vicki Georges Hufnagel, includes a  recommendation that the California Board of Medical Quality Assurance place  Hufnagel on five years of probation, require her to pass a competency  examination, take a special medical ethics course and permit another physician  to review her bills before they are sent to patients.  </P> <P> The opinion of the administrative law judge, Robert A. Neher, is the latest  development in a state license revocation case against Hufnagel originally  filed in 1987 as a result of patients' complaints against her. Hufnagel,  operator of the Institute for Reproductive Health, a Beverly Hills clinic,  advocates surgical techniques that are an alternative to a hysterectomy.  </P> <P> Last fall, Hufnagel -- a frequent guest on radio and television talk shows --  published "No More Hysterectomies," which was a broad indictment of the medical  Establishment. In the book, Hufnagel advocated increased use of her own  techniques, which she calls "female reconstructive surgery."  </P> <P> In the opinion, sent to Hufnagel earlier this month and made available to The  Times on Wednesday, Neher concluded that Hufnagel oversold her procedures, most  of which are commonly performed by gynecological surgeons. Neher found that a  letter to one patient amounted to "an instrument of terror" intended "to coerce  the patient into returning for several procedures which (Hufnagel) had every  reason to believe were unnecessary."  </P> <P> Neher found that Hufnagel performed procedures inadequately and repeatedly  overcharged, demanding as much as $21,000 for services that should have cost a  fraction of that amount.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Overblown View'  </P> <P> Testimony in the revocation hearing, Neher concluded, established that  Hufnagel's "zeal for her personal bill of fare got in the way of sound medical  judgment in some cases and the standard of care in others. Her overblown view  of her own knowledge and skill caused her to act incompetently in (still)  others."  </P> <P> Hufnagel, he concluded, "presents herself to patients, colleagues and (the  Board of Medical Quality Assurance) as an innovator, a developer of new  procedures and a crusader on the cutting edge. Rather, she appears to be an  expert of her own creation, much like the entertainer or politician who begins  to believe the truth of his own press releases."  </P> <P> Neher concluded that Hufnagel's contention that overbilling resulted from  innocent bookkeeping errors by her husband, who was acting as her business  manager, "are found to be spurious."  </P> <P> Hufnagel did not respond Wednesday to requests for comment on the judge's  finding.  </P> <P> Neher's recommendation is subject to alteration by the full medical board. The  board is expected to allow Hufnagel several weeks to respond to the judge's  finding.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: HOLLYWOOD;  </P> <P> CLINIC EXPANSION BEGINS  </P> <P> Construction began this week on a major expansion of the Hollywood Sunset  Community Clinic, which provides free or low-cost medical services to more than  24,000 residents of East Hollywood, Silver Lake, Echo Park and downtown Los  Angeles each year. The clinic, established in 1968, also provides legal and  counseling services.  </P> <P> The clinic plans to add a second story to its building at 3324 Sunset Blvd., at  the corner of Micheltorena Street. It also will renovate and remodel some  first-floor offices, said Felix Racelis, development director at the clinic.  </P> <P> "This is long overdue," Racelis said. "We are really cramped for space and this  is really a blessing for us."  </P> <P> The expansion, the first in 10 years, was funded by about $200,000 in grants  from the Los Angeles Community Development Department and about $127,000 from  the state Department of Health Services, Racelis said. He said an additional  $50,000 must be raised from other sources.  </P> <P> Patients at the clinic are encouraged to pay for services, but no one is ever  turned away for lack of funds, Racelis said. Services are offered by staff and  volunteer professionals and interns, he said.  </P></p>

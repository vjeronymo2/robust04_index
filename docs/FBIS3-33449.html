			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Governability Pact Inter-party Board last night  issued a communique in which it urges the government not to  resort to the easy alternative of repression in response to  popular demonstrations which have been silenced for so long.  Reasserting its continued commitment to seek solutions, the  Inter-party Board supports the demands of peasants. Moreover,  it denied that the Inter-party Board had experienced a crisis.    After almost four hours of negotiations, Vice President  Angel  Roberto Seifart read a communique through which the Inter-party  Board members reassert their determination to continue to seek  solutions to national problems. The communique adds that they  support the demands by peasants to increase cotton prices for  the current harvest.    The communique adds that the Governability Pact seeks to  prioritize all technical studies that urge the government to  grant needed financial increases for farmers.    They express their hope that the establishment of the Social  Development Council, which was proposed by the Inter-party  Board, will be an effective way to solve overall social problems  and to implement social welfare policies, and not just to solve  current problems.    The communique urges the national government not to resort  to  foolish repression in answer to popular demonstrations which  have been silenced for so long without first exhausting the  possibility of dialogue as a way to find solutions to the  demands. The communique states that the Inter-party Board is  willing to mediate.    The Inter-party Board members call for an urgent meeting  with  the president to discuss the extent of Decree 436/93 issued on  25 September 1993 establishing restrictions on the free  marketing of cotton. This meeting will probably be held  sometime this week.    Asked about the role of the Governability Pact within the  Social Development Council, Vice President Seifart said it will  continue to work because political parties will play a relevant  role in this new council.    Seifart denied that the Inter-party Board experienced a  crisis. He said that some political party leaders have refered  to the current situation. PLRA [Authentic Radical Liberal  Party] leader Domingo Laino explained the extent of his  statement, stating he never mentioned the possibility of  breaking the Governability Pact, rather of making demands on the  government.    The meeting was attended by representatives from several  political parties, including Miguel Angel Montaner (PDC)  [Christian Democratic Party]; Victor Sanchez Villagra (PRF)  [Febrerista Revolutionary Party]; Juan Carlos Galaverna and  Eugenio Sanabria Cantero (ANR) [National Republican Association  - Colorado Party]; Domingo Laino and Juan M. Benitez Florentin  (PLRA), among others.</p>

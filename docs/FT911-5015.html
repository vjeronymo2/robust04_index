			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Oil sector remains in favour THE oil majors were to the fore yesterday, still responding to the recent spate of buy notes on the sector, the firmness of crude oil prices and suggestions that buying in the past few sessions had uncovered a number of stock shortages among marketmakers. The heaviest turnover in the sector - 9.7m shares - was in BP, where the shares ran up strongly to 359p before ending the day a net 6 higher at 355p. Buying was on the strength of rumours that the UK oil group would be inviting bids for some of its assets in the US. Last night, sources in the energy industry said BP was seeking a buyer for Tex/Con Oil and Gas, a Texas-based subsidiary which holds all its onshore natural gas interests in the US, excluding Alaska. BP declined to comment. Shell were aggressively bought, closing 12 firmer at 511p, after 513p, on turnover of 7m, as strong UK buying outweighed yet more switching out of Shell and into Royal Dutch. Both stocks responded to the positive presentation given to analysts in London last week. British Gas edged up 2 to 246p on 6.4m with the imminent board meeting expected to be followed by Gas's response to Ofgas's new tariff formula. Enterprise, hit recently by worries about Elf possibly placing its 25 per cent stake in the market or Enterprise making a big rights issue, rallied to close 9 higher at 560p. Rank unsettled Rank Organisation lost ground in edgy trading as the company began a series of meetings with securities houses at which analysts are being asked to submit current forecasts and recommendations as a basis for discussion. Cautious noises yesterday from one broker, Panmure Gordon, reflected the mood ahead of the briefings. The shares recovered somewhat as the first meeting began although no analyst had reported back by the time the market closed. There were suggestions that James Capel was in the first briefing. Today's is with Smith New Court. Trading volume was light as Rank added to Friday's decline of 17 with a further fall of 27 at yesterday's lowest point. The final price was 725p, a drop of 11 on the day as 604,000 shares changed hands. The second rights issue in ten months by industrial materials group Morgan Crucible was perceived by the market as being 'cynically opportunist.' After raising Pounds 79m net last June, the group this time called for Pounds 96.1m and the news stunned the market. Higher annual profits of Pounds 60m, against Pounds 54.5m, failed to compensate and the shares moved lower to close 14 down at 256p. Morgan Crucible said there was considerable scope for it to continue to grow both by further acquisitions and organically, and analysts assumed the former was the purpose of the new finance. Many had reservations about the stock, however, and shaved profits estimates for the current year. The immediate consensus figure is around Hoare Govett researcher Mr Richard Rae's forecast of Pounds 69m. American buying was said to be behind the good showing by Royal Bank of Scotland, which settled 6 up at 195p on turnover of 2.1m. Abbey National shares were 2 off at 284p ahead of the presentation, hosted by Daiwa, to Japanese institutions in Tokyo. Press suggestions that Guardian Royal Exchange could end up as a takeover target for Sun Alliance, among others, drove the shares up 7 to 214p. One buyer was said to have been responsible for for Prudential adding 6 at 248p. Blue Circle Industries (BCI), due to report preliminary figures on Thursday, remained dogged by rights issue stories, with some specialists mentioning a possible one-for-five issue at 210p to raise some Pounds 200m. BCI fell 4 to 257p. Recovery prospects outweighed the dismal results from Turriff and left the shares 14 higher at 82p. Whessoe went to 1991 high of 194p before ending 5 up on balance at 189p, benefiting from comment on its long-term appeal both to institutional and smaller investors. The engineering group was said to have disposed of troublesome operations, had cash in hand and was trading on a modest prospective price/earnings multiple. Second-half trading seasonally produces the larger contribution to profits, but researchers still look for higher interim figures when Whessoe reports on May 22. Sema, the software group, dropped sharply to close 24 to 349p, hit by suggestions that Cap Gemini Sogeti, the French group, may be about to sell its 27.4 per cent stake and possibly launch a bid for SD-Scicon. Another big turnover in Racal Electronics, 5.7m, was accompanied by vague stories that the group could be about to sell a large stake in Racal Telecom direct to Hutchison Whampoa, the Hongkong conglomerate. Racal intends demerging its 80 per cent subsidiary Racal Telecom later this year. Electronics closed 3 up at 233p as did Telecom, at 381p. Buyers wanted British Vita ahead of tomorrow's annual meeting and the close was 9 higher at 249p. Powerscreen registered good turnover as 1.3m shares were placed but the price remained at 176p. Gartmore Investment Management announced later yesterday a holding of 5.1 per cent. French Connection rose 12 to 47p after it announced a return to profitability of Pounds 57,000, against a loss the previous year of Pounds 4.67m. Asda slipped 2 to 133p as Hoare Govett remained cautious on the food retailer. Profits of Pounds 200m are expected this year, while in 1992/93 Hoare forecasts Pounds 189m, a new estimate. Asda's slower expansion programme, greater competitive pressures and an inability to generate sufficient cash flow will depress profitability, said Hoare. Iceland Frozen Foods climbed 3 to 348p after Kleinwort Benson raised its profits estimate. Albert Fisher added 3 to 121p on optimism ahead of its finals on Thursday. Analysts forecast profits of Pounds 44m against Pounds 30.5m last time. Le Creuset, the French manufacturer of designer cast-iron cookware which joined the USM two ago, attracted support ahead of tomorrow's annual results. Analysts expect profits to exceed Pounds 3m, compared with Pounds 2.67m last time, and the shares closed 9 up at 183p. Fellow USM stock Porth almost doubled to 11p on hopes that reports were true of Sir Michael Edwardes, the former head of British Leyland, joining as chairman. The company is the UK's largest manufacturer of Christmas decorations. The mood among leisure sector traders was cautious as many expected a rights issue from Granada. Some were even prepared to name numbers and plumped for a 2 for 5 issue at 160p today. The share eased a penny to 195p. Allied Leisure, which runs bowling alleys, eased 5 to 104p on news of a one for one rights issue at 97p to raise Pounds 16.1m. Smith New Court, the company's broker, said that gearing had been approaching 150 per cent and that after the issue it would be 40 per cent. Tour operator Airtours climbed 13 to 357p after proposing a placing and offer to raise Pounds 15.9m. The stock's strength was helped by the accompanying statement that bookings at Airtours were three times the level of last year's average. The placement with institutional investors is at 320p, the same price at which existing shareholders can apply on a three for 10 basis. Volatile Brent Walker rose 8 to 71p on confirmation of the transfer of assets, including the Trocadero retail, leisure and office development in central London, to Power Corp. Maxwell Communication Corporation (MCC) was squeezed higher yet again as the market prepared for details due this week of the proposed flotation of Mirror Group newspapers. Both companies are controlled by Mr Robert Maxwell. US securities house Goldman Sachs was again persistently bidding for MCC shares, which climbed 14 to 239p.

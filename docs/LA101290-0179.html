			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TERRIER BEATS RUFF ODDS IN KUWAIT ESCAPE  </P> <P> A dog named after a fictional British flying ace, Biggles, narrowly escaped  death in the Persian Gulf crisis when he was trapped in a stranded airliner,  rescued by flight attendants and smuggled to safety in Jordan.  </P> <P> The West Highland terrier was recovering at London's Heathrow Airport today  after flying in from Amman on Thursday.  </P> <P> "He must be one of the luckiest dogs alive. He seems like a natural survivor,"  a British Airways spokesman said.  </P> <P> Biggles was on his way to Malaysia to join his British owner when a jumbo jet  was stranded in Kuwait by the Iraqi invasion.  </P> <P> The passengers and crew were ordered off the plane, but Biggles was left inside  the cargo hold in a cage.  </P> <P> The crew found him three days later, and two flight attendants took him to  their hotel, naming him Biggles after the flying ace in a series of British  boys' books.  </P> <P> But Biggles' adventures were not over. The crew took the dog with them overland  to Baghdad and eventually smuggled him to Jordan with a group of refugees.  </P></p>

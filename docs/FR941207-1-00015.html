			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Forest habitat required for Mexican spotted owl nesting and roosting appears to be more restricted than that required for foraging. Ganey and Balda (1994) found significant owl selectivity in habitat use in a comparison of the habitat characteristics of roosting, foraging, and randomly available sites. Roosting sites had larger logs, greater canopy cover, and higher densities and basal areas of both trees and snags than foraging sites and random sites.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Spotted owls apparently use a wider array of habitat types for foraging than for nesting and roosting, including fairly open and non-contiguous forest, small openings, pure ponderosa pine forests, woodlands, and rocky slopes. Use of these components may be determined by their availability and by their proximity to the more characteristic habitat attributes previously described. However, Ganey and Balda (1994) found a greater selectivity in habitat used for foraging than for random sample sites. As did roosting sites, foraging areas had larger logs, greater canopy cover, and higher densities and basal areas of both trees and snags than random sites. Owls also consistently avoided foraging in forests in which the overstory had been partially harvested.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Little is known about the habitat requirements for dispersal. Habitat that meets the species' needs for nesting and roosting may also provide for foraging and dispersal. However, habitat that supports foraging or dispersal does not always provide constituent elements required for nesting and roosting. The definition of the term ``dispersal'' is frequently limited to post-fledging movements of juveniles. For the purposes of this rule, the Service considers the term to include all movement, including winter shifts in territory and dispersal from natal areas, and to encompass the important biological concepts of connectivity within and between clusters of Mexican spotted owl territories. Although habitat that allows for dispersal may be marginal or unsuitable for nesting or roosting, it provides connectivity between blocks of nesting habitat both locally and over the Mexican spotted owl's range that is essential to demographic interaction and genetic flow. Thus, dispersal habitat includes unoccupied habitat of varying quality that may support intermittent use as a ``stepping stone'' between occupied areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mexican spotted owls occur in relatively isolated mountain ranges, often separated by wide expanses of Sonoran, Chihuahuan, and Great Basin desert and other nonforested lands. Preliminary studies of juvenile owl dispersal in southern Utah (Willey 1993) and New Mexico (Peter Stacey, University of Nevada, Reno,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1993) have shown movements across a wide variety of habitat types, including both riparian areas and vegetation types considered too open for consistent use by Mexican spotted owls. In Southern Arizona, spotted owls occur in isolated clusters separated by desert habitat. It is probable that these small clusters are not self-sustaining, but depend on immigration from other areas to maintain demographic and genetic viability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The results of a 3-year telemetry study of owls and habitat in southern Utah indicate seasonal shifts in habitat use (van Riper and Willey 1992, Willey 1993). During the breeding season, about 25 percent of adult owl locations occurred outside of steep canyon terrain. During the fall and winter seasons, about half of the locations occurred on mesa-tops, benches, and warm slopes above the canyons. Movement out of the relatively cool canyons used in summer months to warmer areas used in winter may be related to the thermoregulatory requirements of the species. Movements out of the summer home ranges during the winter season were highly variable. A few owls moved completely out of their summer ranges, several shifted into adjacent areas with some overlap of seasonal ranges, and others remained within the same area year round.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Current Situation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Federal, State, tribal, and private lands contain habitat for the owl. Federal agencies involved include the Forest Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), National Park Service (NPS), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and Department of Defense. Tribes include the Navajo, San Carlos Apache, White Mountain Apache, Southern Ute, Jicarilla Apache, Hualapai, and the Mescalero Apache. Efforts to estimate habitat acreage and survey effort for owls have varied among agencies and tribes, with the most intensive work being done by the Forest Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, land-managing agencies characterize Mexican spotted owl habitat under the term ``suitable.'' Suitable habitat is often identified only as habitat able to sustain the combined nesting, roosting, and foraging needs of the Mexican spotted owl. The definition often excludes additional habitat used only for foraging and may underestimate the total habitat available within an owl territory and across the species' range.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Forest Service land in Arizona and New Mexico contains 1,267,000 ha (3,130,000 acres) of suitable habitat, with an additional 421,000 ha (1,040,000 acres) described as being capable of returning to suitable condition (L. Henson, Southwest Regional Forester,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1993). Forest Service land in Colorado is estimated to have about 356,000 ha (880,000 acres) of forested suitable habitat. Recent estimates of suitable canyon habitat in Utah national forests is about 58,000 ha (143,000 acres) (Kate Grandison, Dixie National Forest,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1994). No capable acreage figure is available for Utah and Colorado. Combining all Forest Service suitable habitat with the capable habitat in the Southwest Region (Arizona and New Mexico) yields a total of habitat acreage of 2,102,000 ha (5,193,000 acres) on Forest Service lands in the four-State area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Forest Service began Mexican spotted owl inventories in New Mexico and Arizona in 1988. Inventories began in Colorado in 1989, and in Utah in 1990. About 1,012,000 ha (2,500,000 acres) had been inventoried in the Forest Service Southwest Region as of the end of the 1993 survey season (USFS 1993). Utah and Colorado national forests have inventoried 354,000 ha (875,000 acres) and about 202,000 ha (500,000 acres), respectively (K. Grandison,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

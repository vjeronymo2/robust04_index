			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANALYSTS DOUBT AT&amp;T, NCR MERGER IN OFFING;  </P> <P> TECHNOLOGY: A PUBLISHED REPORT SAID A COMBINATION WAS BEING CONSIDERED.  </P> <P> American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. is considering combining its computer  business with NCR Corp. to boost its computer operations, according to a  published report. But Wall Street analysts Thursday discounted the validity of  the accounts and questioned the wisdom of such a deal.  </P> <P> Neither AT&amp;T, whose efforts to become a major presence in the computer  business have faltered over the last six years, nor NCR, best known for its  computerized cash registers, would comment on the possibility of a combination.  An acquisition by AT&amp;T of NCR could be valued as high as $6 billion.  </P> <P> Analysts said rumors of the deal may have started because AT&amp;T, the world's  largest telephone company, has repeatedly evaluated the wisdom of taking over  NCR as a way of winning a larger piece of the computer market. But they noted  that over the years, AT&amp;T has also looked at acquisitions of other computer  makers, including Unisys Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp., and done nothing.  </P> <P> Since entering the computer business in the mid-1980s, amid fanfare that it  would soon rival giant International Business Machines, AT&amp;T has struggled  and lost billions of dollars. That failure, analysts say, is largely because  the company -- steeped in the traditions of a monopoly operation -- has been  unable to keep pace with the rapid technological innovations in the computer  industry. AT&amp;T's computer operation, a $2-billion-a-year business, is still  losing money, despite company promises that it would be profitable by this  year.  </P> <P> However, analysts said, AT&amp;T doesn't need to gain a stronger market  presence through an acquisition. "AT&amp;T needs a better computer sales force  into corporate America and a greater market presence outside the United  States," said Stephen K. Smith of Paine Webber in New York.  </P> <P> Added Ulrich Weil, a technology analyst in Washington: "AT&amp;T doesn't need a  multibillion (dollar) acquisition to gain access to computer manufacturing.  AT&amp;T seems to me more likely to get out of the computer-making business  than into it."  </P> <P> Although discounting the possibility of an AT&amp;T-NCR merger, analysts said  they could not rule out entirely some sort of deal between the two companies.  One possibility, analysts said, is a manufacturing agreement under which NCR  would make computers for AT&amp;T's private label.  </P></p>

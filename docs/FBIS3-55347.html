			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Tallinn, Jan 06, BNS -- Estonian Prime Minister  Mart Laar at 1 p.m. local time [1100 GMT] today presented to the  country's president the formal proposals concerning the  replacement of Foreign Minister Trivimi Velliste, Finance  Minister Madis Uurike, Economics Minister Toomas Sildmae and  Defense Minister Juri Luik.    The new appointments are Juri Luik as the foreign minister,  Heiki Kranich as the finance minister, Toivo Jurgenson as the  economics minister and Indrek Kannik as the defense minister.    Laar after the meeting at the presidential office at  Kadriorg  characterized the president's reaction to the planned changes in  the Cabinet as "understanding."    "The president asked a few questions," Laar said. "He will  surely consider the aptitude or inaptitude of each candidate for  the office at least for himself."    Laar said no hindrances were to be expected from President  Meri for the Cabinet changes. "I felt no such tone during the  conversation with the president. This (changes in the Cabinet)  is an issue to be decided upon by the coalition and the prime  minister," he said.    The prime minister said that in his point of view the  constitution didn't allow the president to refuse from approving  a minister candidate. "But there also are gaps in the  constitution," Laar added. [passage omitted]</p>

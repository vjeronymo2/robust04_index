			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / International Company News: Texaco plans to sell oilfield in Columbia Texaco, the US oil group, confirmed that it plans to sell an oilfield in Colombia, as well as a pipeline that connects the field to a refinery owned by the government, Reuter reports from New York. A Texaco spokesman said the company would keep its downstream operations in Colombia. 'We are not leaving the country,' he said. Industry sources said the oilfield produces about 15,000 barrels per day. The spokesman said the planned sale was part of a programme of evaluating upstream assets. He added that the move was not the start of a wave of divestiture. Texaco said that it would retain a lubrication/blending operation in Colombia.</p>

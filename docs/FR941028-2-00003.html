The committee will provide advice regarding implementation of a comprehensive ecosystem management strategy for federal land within the Deschutes Province. The Deschutes Province is bordered on the north by the Columbia River between Bonneville and just north of Wasco. From Wasco, it follows the divide between the John Day and the Deschutes Rivers south to the Mill Creek Wilderness on the Ochoco National Forest. It follows the northern edge of the Mill Creek Wilderness east through the Ochoco Mountains along the southern boundary of the Bridge Creek Wilderness. From there it continues east for approximately two miles then heads southeast to Wolf Mountain continuing along the ridge west of the John Day River to the northernmost part of the Snow Mountain Ranger District (Ochoco National Forest). From there it switches to a southwestern direction along the divide between areas draining into the Deschutes and those draining into Malheur Lake down to Glass Butte. From Glass Butte it follows east through China Hat and almost to Newberry Crater where it turns to the southwest to Spring Butte and Walker Mountain. From Walker Mountain it swings south to Chemult then heads west up to Mt. Thielsen and the Cascades Crest. From there it follows along the Cascades Crest to the Columbia River. The Deschutes Province includes the following hydrologic units: Middle Columbia-Hood, Lower Deschutes, Trout, Upper Deschutes, Lower Crooked, Upper Crooked, Beaver-South Fork and the Little Deschutes. The 7.6 million acre Deschutes Province has approximately 1,631,200 acres falling within the range of the northern spotted owl including 1,144,500 acres of National Forest System land and 40 acres of DOD ownership. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The advisory committee will consist of 27 members from the following entities: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> From State, Local and Tribal Governments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One State of Oregon representative; three county government representatives, total, selected from Crook, Deschutes, Jefferson, and Wasco Counties; and three Tribal Government representatives selected from the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, Burns Paiute, and Klamath Tribes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> From Public Interest Groups: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Two representatives of environmental interests, two representatives of different sectors of the forest products industry, and two representatives of the recreation and tourism sectors.

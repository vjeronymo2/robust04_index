			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Lloyds Abbey The market was presumptuous yesterday to expect a more generous final payout from Lloyds Abbey Life. Distribut-able profits in 1991 surpassed dividends by 25 per cent, but it is hard to see the company being comfortable with cover much below the 1.4 to 1.5 times favoured by the old Abbey, and by Hambro Life before its takeover by BAT. A more legitimate question for investors is where future profits will come from to sustain the present rating of the shares. After-tax profits of the established insurance business have grown just 17 per cent over the last four years, and are bound to feel the draught this year from the newly created J Rothschild Assurance. Bowmaker is in the doldrums, and may well require a further Pounds 100m provision in 1992 as individual and small business borrowers suffer disproportionately at this stage in the cycle. Black Horse Agencies desperately needs a turnover increase in the housing market, but few expect the current increase in inquiries to translate quickly into higher sales. All this puts enormous pressure on the company's continuing ability to sell life and general insurance products through the bank - a market which is far from exhausted but which cannot continue to grow indefinitely. On the face of it the shares look well supported with a 6 per cent yield and an historic multiple of just 12 at last night's closing price of 379p. That is forgetting the cloudy dividend prospects and the sharp premium which investors are paying over embedded value. They are not yet cheap.</p>

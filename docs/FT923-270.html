			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / National Savings cuts interest rates NATIONAL Savings yesterday announced significant cuts in the interest it offers on fixed-rate savings products. The cuts varied between 0.75 percentage points and a full percentage point. The Building Societies Association said it would ease pressure further on building societies' mortgage rates. The launch in July of the First Option Bond, which offers a fixed rate over one year with tax paid, caused wide protest from building societies, which said it was impossible to match. The initial rate for the bond of 10.34 per cent gross prompted the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society to raise its mortgage rate, and this was followed by a cut in in the bond's gross interest rate of 0.67 percentage points. The gross interest on the bond has now been cut by a full percentage point to 8.67 per cent. Similar cuts were made to National Savings' more traditional products. The new 39th Issue Savings Certificates guarantee a tax-free return of 6.75 per cent after five years; the 38th Issue paid 7.50 per cent. These certificates will now be sold in units of Pounds 100 rather than units of Pounds 25, which should also lessen the pressure on building societies. Series E Capital Bonds, which offered 10 per cent gross, have been withdrawn and replaced by Series F bonds which offer 9 per cent. The new Issue D of Children's Bonus Bonds will also see a cut of one point, from 10.1 per cent to 9.1 per cent. Meanwhile, Halifax Building Society, the largest mortgage lender, yesterday signalled that it is looking for high-value low-risk customers in the housing market as it and Woolwich, the third largest building society, moved their basic mortgage interest rates down to 9.99 per cent, David Barchard writes. In both cases, the reduced rates apply immediately to new customers and from November 1 for existing borrowers. Halifax's decision to trim its standard interest rate by 0.66 percentage points to 9.99 per cent was a surprise as it means that many Halifax mortgages are now slightly more expensive than those of Abbey National, its main market rival, which last week cut its rate to 9.95 per cent. However, Halifax has structured its charges to ensure that it undercuts Abbey National for very large loans, if the borrower is seeking less than three-quarters of the value of the property. Halifax customers with mortgages over Pounds 100,000 will be charged 9.24 per cent, compared with 9.49 per cent for similar mortgages from Abbey National. For customers with high loan-to-value mortgages, Halifax borrowers will pay 9.70 per cent against 9.49 per cent from Abbey National.</p>

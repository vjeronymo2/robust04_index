			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cereals deficit 'could be 700m tonnes in 2025' The world could be 700m tonnes short of its annual cereal requirement by the year 2025, according to a report published today. Demand for cereals in developing countries is expected to double to 2bn tonnes by that year, with another 400m tonnes required for the 'hidden' poor who are priced out of the market, says Prof Gordon Conway, an agricultural ecologist and vice-chancellor of Britain's Sussex University. But growth in cereal yields in some regions is slowing and total production in developing countries could reach only 1.7bn tonnes, he says in a paper to be discussed in Washington this week by the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research. 'The shortfall could be even greater if the agricultural environment further deteriorates,' he says. About 17 per cent of the vegetated area is degraded, forests are being lost at an annual rate of about 16m hectares and the global fisheries catch is stagnant or declining. Prof Conway says western donors have cut their funding of the CGIAR - which pays for agricultural research to help developing countries - in the belief that population and environment are higher priorities. Arguing that substantial investment in research is needed, Prof Conway calls for a 'super-green revolution' to create food security and sustainable livelihoods for the poor. 'It will not be enough to rely on the simple transfer of technologies,' he says. 'The research institutions of industrialised and developing countries will need to be linked in new partnerships that reflect the opportunities created by the revolution in modern biology.'</p>

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / International Company News: Corrigan takes full-time post at Goldman Sachs MR Gerald Corrigan, one of the leading figures in international finance before he stepped down as head of the New York Federal Reserve Bank in summer, is to take on a full-time position with Goldman Sachs, the investment bank, next year. However, Mr Corrigan, 52, will not become a partner of the firm, renowned as one of the most profitable, and secretive, on Wall Street. Nor will he have any direct management responsibility. The bulk of his income will take the form of what he termed a 'plain vanilla' salary, rather than the profit shares which have made Goldman partners among the highest-paid in the industry. The former New York Fed chief, who began his career as an economist there 25 years ago, will take charge of one-off projects at Goldman. He will also deal with the banks' clients and take responsibility for some transactions. He and Mr Stephen Friedman, Goldman chairman, denied this would give him only a peripheral role at the bank. They said the position had been specially designed to give Mr Corrigan flexibility, rather than tie him down to one role. One of Mr Corrigan's first assignments was likely to be a review of all the risks being incurred by Goldman Sachs in its business, including market and operational risks, said Mr Friedman. Explaining the need for a full review, he said: 'We should not just close the stable door after the horse has bolted.' Mr Corrigan caused a stir throughout the banking industry at the start of last year when he questioned whether banks had sufficient control over the risks they were running in the derivatives markets. Yesterday, he said the furore stirred up by his speech had a positive effect. 'There is no question in my mind that it has helped to stimulate a more aggressive approach to risk management systems and better management information. I haven't regretted making that speech - even if it made me a dartboard target in some trading rooms.' Because of his former role as a bank supervisor, Mr Corrigan said he had decided not to take a position at a commercial bank. He will not advise Goldman on its trading activities, or on any bank-related transactions, until after next summer, when he will have been out of the Federal Reserve system for a year. The move into the private sector may mark a significant change for the former central banker, but it is unlikely to stop him making more provocative statements. 'Clearly, it's the other side of the street,' he said. 'But I don't intend to become a wall flower on broad issues of public interest and concern.'</p>

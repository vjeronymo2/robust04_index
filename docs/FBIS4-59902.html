			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Christopher's Visit to Jericho"] </F>   [Text] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's visit  to Jericho yesterday reflects his country's interest and that of  the international community in general in the steps achieved by  the peace process, most prominent of which was the Palestinian  Authority's assumption of the security task in and the  administration of the Gaza Strip and Jericho.    As far as the Palestinians are concerned, Christopher's  visit  expresses the continuation of the role of the participating  sponsor which the United States has been fulfilling since the  Madrid Conference. The U.S. secretary's remarks in Jericho  affirmed this sense through the words of encouragement and  support. The visit provided an opportunity to Secretary  Christopher to be apprised the situation in the interim rule  area in all its aspects and from the first days of the  Palestinian National Authority's assumption of its task.    Needless to say the construction of the new-born Palestinian  entity will begin from zero. On this basis, the supporting role  of the United States and of other donor countries in building  the Palestinian economy and infrastructure must not be delayed,  since the interim stage stipulated in the Palestinian-Israeli  Declaration of Principles [DOP] has already begun. The DOP has  been supported by the international community as the first step  toward the achievement of a just and comprehensive peace in the  region.    The Palestinian side has proved, in practice, its commitment  to peace and to the agreements signed with the Israeli side. It  is up to the parties that are eager to promote and expand the  peace project -- amid a harsh and difficult environment -- to  create the suitable conditions for rebuilding the Palestinian  edifice in all spheres. This is because, on one hand, peace  does not endure amid suffering and misery. On the other hand,  the repercussions of what takes place on the Palestinian track,  whether positively or negatively, will affect the other Arab  tracks which are looking forward to the Palestinian example to  draw the appropriate lessons and conclusions.    Undoubtedly, this visit by the U.S. secretary of state  represents the beginning of action by various parties and  international forces that support peace. The sons of the  Palestinian people are awaiting a practical response to this  action after having suffered a long time under total Israeli  occupation and its consequences on the Palestinian economic  infrastructure in general.</p>

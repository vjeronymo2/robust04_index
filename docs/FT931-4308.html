			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: Tokyo poised to deregulate brokerage commissions JAPAN's ministry of finance is likely to deregulate brokerage commissions in April 1994, starting with large-lot transactions worth more than Y1bn (Dollars 8.58m). An advisory panel to the ministry yesterday recommended that liberalisation of the country's fixed stock exchange commissions be implemented gradually while monitoring the effects on investors and securities houses. Japan is the only leading stockmarket where brokers' commissions are fixed. A spate of stockmarket scandals two years ago stemmed directly from this practice. In the absence of price competition firms chose to win large clients by compensating them for stock losses. Earlier attempts by the ministry to deregulate the fixed price rate commission system have met with fierce opposition from the securities industry, which argues that liberalisation will lead to higher small-lot rates, driving individuals away from the stock market.</p>

			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Fashion: Pearl drops Pearls are the great classic of the jewellery chest. They never date and they are the easiest, quickest way of adding instant glamour. Almost everyone has a string or two somewhere. It was Coco Chanel who showed us how to wear them: with great panache in long, long strings (when fake), or demurely round the neck under a sweetly innocent, pure white collar in three strings (when real). She it was who decreed: 'When you make it fake, you always make it bigger.' Buying real pearls, however, is difficult - telling cultured from real often needs an X-ray. And while real pearls are beyond the reach of all except the super-rich, the quality (and price) of cultured pearls can vary enormously. Knowing what you are paying for is not always easy. For anyone fascinated by pearls who wants to learn more about them, a tiny but magical London jewellery shop, Manguette, is having a festival of pearls (faux and real) for two weeks during June (the pearl is the birth-stone for those born in that month). One of the designers featured will be Esmiralda who, while not a big name in Britain, has a splendid reputation in America and Thailand. She does amazing things with pearls. She uses them for great big cuffs, turning them into long strings or woven cloches (for which she won a Japanese Cultured Pearl Association design prize); teams them with cabochon stones to make a necklace; or just turns out stunning earrings. The festival will also show the work of other contemporary designers including Gatto Bianco, a husband and wife design team from Florence, which specialises in large and luscious pearls set in silver rings. For those not within reach of Manguette, try a sumptuous book called Pearls (Ornament and Obsession), by Kristin Joyce and Shellei Addison (Thames and Hudson, Pounds 38). Manguette is at 20a Kensington Church Walk, London W8, tel: 071-937 2897. The exhibition runs from June 1 to 15.</p>

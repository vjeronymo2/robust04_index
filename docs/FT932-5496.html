			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Anglian Group advances 24% to Pounds 23m LOWER INTEREST charges helped Anglian Group, the double glazing company which came to the market last year, announce a 24 per cent jump in pre-tax profits from Pounds 18.6m to Pounds 23.1m. Operating profits, struck on sales 4 per cent higher at Pounds 151.4m, were only marginally ahead from Pounds 23m to Pounds 23.2m for the 53 weeks to April 3. However, the pre-tax return was helped by a Pounds 4.5m drop in interest charges to Pounds 1.2m. The results compare with the 52 weeks to March 28 1992. Mr Bill Hancock, chief executive, said he was reasonably pleased with the improvement in sales and profit given the tough conditions in the market. The company estimated that the overall UK market had declined by about 10 per cent in the past year. Mr Hancock said the group had experienced particularly tough trading following the devaluation of sterling and withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism. However, consumer confidence appeared to have picked up in the final quarter. The overall order book had risen by about Pounds 5m from the start of the year to Pounds 35m on the back of stronger retail interest. The commercial division, which performed largely public sector work, had a slightly lower order book than last year. However, it now comprised about 15 per cent of sales, against 10 per cent. The larger proportion of public sector work was partly responsible for a decline in margins from 15.8 per cent to 15.3 per cent. Mr Hancock said the group expected benefits in the current year from the Pounds 8.5m purchase in March of New England Windows, which supplies local authorities in England and Wales. On a pro forma basis, which assumes that the capital reorganisation and share issue at the flotation had been in place for the last financial year, Anglian showed a 6 per cent advance to Pounds 24.2m pre-tax. The proposed final dividend of 5.8p makes 9.5p for the year. This compares with a notional pay-out of 8.7p on a pro forma basis. Earnings fell from 18.9p to 18.7p per share, based on the pre-flotation share structure.</p>

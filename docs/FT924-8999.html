			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Food: Early birds start here - Appetisers IF YOU feel a faint frisson at the thought of having to face the standard British turkey routine, you may like to consider celebrating Italian style this Christmas. On Wednesdays, beginning next week, in the kitchens of Books For Cooks in London's Notting Hill, Anna Del Conte and Carla Tomasi will join forces to offer an inspired double helping of the best of Italian festive cuisine. Each of the one-day cookery classes will be devoted to festive menus from a different region: Lazio (Tomasi's homeland), Milan (Del Conte's birthplace) the Veneto and Sicily. Recipes include a magnificent fritto misto, montebianco, polenta with squid, caponatina and farsumagru. For details and bookings tel: 071-278-2659. Philippa Davenport. Although Italian cooking is in vogue, one of that country's most gastronomically exciting areas, Piedmont, has been sadly ignored. Pizzicato, 34 Rupert Street, London W1 (tel: 071-734-0122) is an attempt to rectify that. The emphasis is heavily on design - elaborate spotlights, thick candles and waiters in brightly coloured waistcoats - but the food and wine list, entirely Piedmontese, is impressive too. The food conveys the rustic feel of the area - open parsley ravioli with wild mushrooms, a pizza of wild boar sausage and pecorino, a grilled breast of chicken with gnocchi and baked rabbit with white wine, hazelnuts and rosemary potatoes. The wine list provides an excellent introduction to some of that area's unique grape varieties - Nebbiolo, Arneis and Cortese - from some of its top producers - Gaja, Pio Cesare and Ceretto. Open seven days, noon to midnight. Nicholas Lander My largest post-bag came two years ago after an article on the early demise of Chez Max in Richmond, Surrey, run by Mark and Max Renzland. Since then the Renzlands have been cooking their way around London looking for a way back into the restaurant business without excessive borrowings. Their solution may epitomise the 1990s. They have invested no more than Pounds 5,000 in fixtures and fittings for unlicensed premises which, during the day, is run as a cafe called Bonzos. In the evening the Renzlands step in, throw on the red-checked tablecloths, rename it Le Petit Max and start cooking the type of food that brought them so many admirers: crab and mussel soup, confit of duck with cabbage, skate with black butter and braised oxtail with red wine and lardons. Costs are deliberately being kept down by a short menu; a staff of three and a set price of around Pounds 14 for three courses. Bring your own wine, corkage Pounds 1. Open seven nights a week and Sunday lunch, 97a High Street, Hampton Wick, Middlesex. Tel: 081-977-0236. NL The price of wines in restaurants seems to be everybody's bete noir. As a former restaurateur I find these complaints a little excessive as food and wine are the only two possible sources of profit - no restaurant makes a profit on the service or the ambience. However, Fortnum &amp; Mason has decided to adopt a pricing policy that should please everyone. Taking advantage of its revamped wine department, it adds, for restaurant wine lists, a straight Pounds 2 margin to the retail prices. Bargains in its Fountain Restaurant include Ch La Lagune 1983, Pounds 25; Chianti Isole e Olena 1990, Pounds 12.75; a house white Burgundy Pounds 9.50; Puligny Montrachet Carillon 1990, Pounds 25.50 and a Dr Loosen Moselle at Pounds 6.75. NL. Yes, more American food. For those who want to celebrate Bill Clinton's victory as US President with more than a tired hamburger and a glass of root beer, the Inter-Continental on London's Hyde Park Corner (071-409-3131) is promoting American cuisine, beers and wine throughout this month. Specialities will include fish and seafood chowder, country peanut soup, southern fried chicken, carpetbagger steaks and lots more. For Republicans drowning their sorrows, cocktails include 'Bush's Booster', which consists of: one part vodka, one part almond liqueur, a dash of lemon, lime and curacao served on crushed ice with a wedge of lime. Yuck. You can't win 'em all . . .</p>

			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Italy pushes energy tax to end impasse: US hits back at critics on opening day of Earth Summit ITALY will propose a new energy tax at today's Earth Summit session in an attempt to resolve what Mr Giorgio Ruffolo, its environment minister, calls the 'financial impasse' preventing the realisation of conference targets. Mr Ruffolo suggested two alternative proposals. The first would extend to all OECD countries the European Community scheme to place a Dollars 3 per barrel tax on non-renewable energy sources from 1993, increasing by Dollars 1 a year until the year 2000. This would, he said, yield Dollars 70bn-Dollars 200bn a year, which could be used to finance targets agreed at the summit such as energy saving and technological co-operation with developing countries. The more modest suggestion is for a Dollars 1 per barrel energy tax in all OECD countries, which he said would yield Dollars 25bn a year and cut carbon emissions by 0.5 per cent. The money would go into a sustainable development fund. Mr Ruffalo said European colleagues had responded favourably to his proposal, but admitted 'it may not be a proposal for the conference itself but a process which begins here'. He warned that 'the proof of the pudding is in the eating and the proof of this conference will be in the willingness of rich countries to provide the huge investments needed by the poor to develop and protect the environment'. Meanwhile, the US, singled out by many as the villain of the summit before it even started, used yesterday's opening day to hit back at its critics and defend the positions it has adopted on the main issues. Mr William Reilly, administrator of the Environment Protection Agency, said: 'We are proud of our environmental record. We have more forests and cleaner rivers today than 100 years ago.' Mr Reilly arrived to a fiercely hostile reception from the vast audience because of the obstructive role the US is seen to have played in negotiating the treaties before the summit. It forced a compromise on a treaty to limit greenhouse gases, and has refused to sign a second one protecting biological diversity. Athough intense diplomatic efforts are under way behind the scenes to get the US to alter its position, Mr Reilly thought it unlikely that sufficient changes could be negotiated in the two weeks for the US to change its mind. He also dismissed an option being considered by other countries: a side declaration expressing reservations. Instead, he said that the main US object was to achieve a satisfactory declaration to protect the world's forests. The US would be contributing over Dollars 500m a year (an increase of Dollars 150m) to the Dollars 2.7bn it hoped donor countries would give to improve world forest management each year. Despite Mr Reilly's efforts to add a constructive note to his statements and his spirited performance, his appearance cast a pall over the opening day and dampened expectations that the summit's already much weakened proposals for action could be strengthened. As the summit opened yesterday Brazil's President Fernando Collor, who will preside over the 12-day gathering, pressed what is likely to be one of the central themes by emphasising the links between economic backwardness and environmental degradation. 'We cannot have an environmentally sound planet in a socially unjust world,' he told delegates from 180 countries. He urged them to aim for 'sustainable development - the key concept which must bring together rich and poor, large and small countries, so that we may all achieve prosperity and shorten the distances that separate us'. The theme was picked up by other dignitaries at the opening: King Gustav of Sweden, President Mario Soares of Portugal and Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, Norway's prime minister. Tight security added to the tension of the event, and inflame tempers in Rio's stifling heat. Queues of people and cars accumulated early around the conference centre. After the opening ceremony, the summit broke up into committees which will work on the documents to be signed by heads of state at the end of next week.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Chris Patten Stages Constitutional Reform </F> Duets"]    [Text] Chris Patten, the last governor of Hong Kong, and  some members of the Legislative Council [Legco] recently have  given two-man comic shows.    Example one: Legco member Emily Lau Wai-hing claimed that  Patten's constitutional reform package "is far from democracy,"  and tabled a private member's bill proposing a comprehensive  direct election in 1995. In his article published on the eve of  Legco's examining the constitutional reform package, Patten  criticized Lau's bill, saying: "Can we put an end to the  disputes by adopting Lau's bill? Is it true that the public  needs an electoral arrangement that clearly runs counter to the  Basic Law?" From this, a person of good sense knows immediately  that Lau's bill serves only to clear the way for Legco to pass  Patten's reform package because Lau told the public long ago  that she would support the package. Rather than really  criticizing Lau, Patten tried to make electoral arrangements in  their interest by upholding the Basic Law.    Example two: Legco member Szeto Wah, from the United  Democrats of Hong Kong (UDHK), put forward an unprecedented  motion to criticize Patten, saying that the latter refused to  approve Legco's amendment to the decision on rates, in  contravention of the popular will. Szeto pointed out at the  meeting that his motion is without parallel in history and  possibly also in the future. What Szeto really seeks is for  someone to follow his example in the future by criticizing those  in power, rather than uniqueness of his motion in history.  Patten, who understood the implication of Szeto's motion,  immediately praised Szeto for his "criticism" at Legco's  question-and-answer session, saying that "this represents a step  forward toward democracy in a political society." Patten also  "pledged that he would defend Legco's powers to criticize the  government, or the governor, before and after 1997." Just as  the drinker's heart is not in the cup, what Patten hopes is that  the Hong Kong Government will be subject to criticism after 1997  rather than before.    Example three: Early this year, Legco member Christine Lok  Kung-wai distributed the draft "Access to Information Law" she  had drawn up, claiming that after consultation, the draft law  would be presented to Legco for examination as a private  member's bill. The basic points of the draft law are: The  government must keep the public aware of its documents,  materials, information, and materials about individuals other  than those which the government can really prove would undermine  "Hong Kong's major interests" or "the public interests" if  brought into the open; any resident is entitled to have free  access to the government's information or make relevant  inquiries; and the government should appoint a special  information officer to whom the public can complain of any  government department's refusal to bring its information to  light. Recently, Patten decided to "reject" Lok's draft "Access  to Information Law." Instead, the government will implement a  comprehensive set of rules on access to information. In fact,  however, the rules published by the government shows that it has  incorporated in them the principal points of Lok's draft law,  which will bring a major change to the operation of government  departments. To prevent the rule's affecting its governance,  the government decided that the rules should be tried out before  they are put into effect in 1996. The government also said it  does not rule out the possibility of passing the rules into law.  Is it not very clear what this means?    Example four: Patten supports Legco's decision to examine  the revised version of the "Public Security Ordinance," which  has been revised in a manner reminiscent of the "Mass  Organizations Ordinance" revision in 1992. At that time, the  regulations on banning local mass organizations from  establishing ties with political organizations abroad, as well  as political organizations abroad setting up branches in Hong  Kong, were deleted and the original system requiring mass  organizations to register with the proper authorities was  replaced by a system whereby mass organizations need only notify  the government of their founding, thus weakening the  government's administration of mass organizations. According to  the revised "Public Security Ordinance," any mass organization  need only notify the government of the rally or demonstration to  be held, instead of applying for a license beforehand. This  also will weaken the government's administration. This revision  totally runs against Article 23 of the Basic Law, which  "prohibits foreign political organizations or bodies from  conducting political activities in the SAR (the Hong Kong  Special Administrative Region) and prohibits political  organizations or bodies of the SAR from establishing ties with  foreign political organizations or bodies." This is a major  issue of principle, while a number of Legco members from the  UDHK criticized the government for making only a limited  revision of the ordinance, saying the revision relaxing  restrictions on demonstrations and rallies is "a trivial one."    In all these two-man comic shows, standing at the front of  the stage were pro-British, anti-Chinese Legco members, and  acting behind the scenes was Patten. Sometimes the two parties  echoed each other; sometimes certain Legco members "hurled  abuses" at Patten; and sometimes Patten "criticized" certain  Legco members. Whatever they did was designed to support each  other in directing their spearheads at their common target: the  post-1997 SAR government and the Chinese Government.    It is clear to everyone that all the above activities  suggest  that the British side has stepped up its arrangements for reform  of the political and legal systems. When it comes to the  political system, the British side is trying to arrange for a  number of pro- British, anti-Chinese elements to sit on the  post-1997 Legco. Where the legal system is concerned, it is  trying to revise or work out a set of ordinances to support the  pro-British and anti-Chinese forces in their effort to make  trouble in the SAR and in their struggle against the Chinese  Government.    However, cheap tricks after all are worth nothing. No matter  what tricks Patten is playing and will play, the last three-tier  council under the British rule will be disbanded 30 June 1997,  and the future SAR government certainly will not acknowledge  ordinances that run counter to the Basic Law.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart I_Disaster Relief Employment Assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A new Subpart I, to be administered under the title III National Reserve Grants program, provides for Disaster Relief Employment Assistance, as authorized by the new Amendments to title IV&hyph;J of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 631.84(a) discusses the projects that a unit of general local government in a disaster area may operate under this subpart. One commenter suggested substituting the phrase, ``Davis-Bacon provisions shall apply on all projects related to demolition, cleanup, repair *&blank;*&blank;*'' for ``on projects regarding demolition, cleanup, repair *&blank;*&blank;*.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While Davis-Bacon does apply to Federal programs, the inclusion of this phrase does not change or clarify the meaning of this provision. Therefore, the section will remain unchanged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 631.85 outlines the participant eligibility criteria under the Disaster Relief Employment Assistance Program. The statutory language regarding eligibility is not accurately reflected in this section. The final rule is revised to correct this problem. In addition, one commenter thought the Department should have the authority to declare persons who are eligible for titles II-A and II-C programs eligible for title III Disaster Relief Programs. Since the statute does not grant the Department this blanket authority, expansion of participant eligibility criteria will not occur. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 631.86 limits the length of disaster relief employment. One commenter questioned the difference between this type of employment and public service employment which is prohibited under titles II and III.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the statute prohibits public service employment funded under title II&hyph;A and C and title III&hyph;A, public service employment is contemplated under title IV-J of the Act. Disaster relief employment is narrowly defined and exclusively limited to the activities described under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;631.84. Allowable activities will not be expanded beyond the statutorily established parameters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This same commenter asked how costs incurred for disaster relief employment should be classified and what criteria should be used in determining the monetary extent to which a cost category has benefited. The Department has chosen not to issue detailed regulations for this program. Specific information regarding Disaster Relief Employment Assistance projects, including any guidance on cost classification issues, will be contained in application guidelines published by the Secretary. Until they are issued, an applicant for these funds should follow the guidelines and information published in the July 9, 1992  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  regarding Emergency Dislocated Worker Projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=56 g=1 f=1 --> PART 637_JOBS FOR EMPLOYABLE DEPENDENT INDIVIDUALS (JEDI)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters addressed this section of the interim final regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The majority of the comments addressed inconsistencies in the numbering of the sections and in the cross-references. The part has been revised to correct the numbering.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, several of the commenters raised questions concerning how the program can be implemented in the absence of any Congressional appropriation. While bonuses will not be awarded under title V of the Act until funds are appropriated by Congress, individuals who are eligible to be counted for title V purposes may be served under other titles of the Act. Since those individuals who would be eligible to be counted for the incentive bonuses under title V must also be eligible for, and have participated in, other activities under the Act, the costs associated with their participation in these activities would be charged to the appropriate program(s) and title(s) of the Act. If a State wishes to participate in the title V bonus program, if it is ever funded, the State may wish to keep track of the outcomes of training for individuals eligible to be counted for bonus purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Effective Date <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department recognizes that the regulations are being issued after the beginning of a program year. To avoid administrative difficulties, the Department has made the effective date of the regulations June 30, 1995, the beginning of Program Year 1995. This will give states and SDA's/SSG's time to plan for the changes that may result from the amendments made in this final rule. States or SDA's/SSG's are, of course, free to implement any of the changes that they find will benefit their programs earlier than the effective date and the Department will treat those changes as legally effective when adopted in any subsequent monitoring or audit resolution activity. Consistent with the Department's desire to enable states and SDAs to implement the beneficial changes in the final rule as quickly as they choose, the provisions of &sect;627.210, authorizing the Department to grant waivers of regulatory requirements are made effective within 30 days of publication to enable states to apply for waivers to be effective before the beginning of PY 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Number <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These programs are listed in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at No. 17&hyph;246, ``Employment and Training Assistance_Dislocated Workers'' (JTPA Title III Programs); and No.17&hyph;250, ``Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA)'' (JTPA Titles I, II, and V Programs).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 20 CFR Parts 626 Through 631 and 637 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Dislocated worker programs, Grant programs, Labor, Manpower training programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Final Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, chapter V of title 20, Code of Federal Regulations is amended, as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.

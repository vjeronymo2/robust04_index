			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / 'Many die' as rebels shoot down airliner DOZENS of passengers were feared killed last night after a Georgian airliner carrying about 100 people was shot down near the besieged city of Sukhumi, Reuter reports from Tbilisi. Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze's staff could only confirm that 26 people, including six crew, escaped before the burning TU-154 airliner exploded on the runway at Sukhumi after being hit by a heat-seeking missile. It was the second plane shot down at the airport in two days. The 75 passengers were soldiers being brought in for the defence of Sukhumi against advances by Abkhaz separatists. Land connections have been severed. On Tuesday, a Tupolev Tu-134 airliner carrying at least 25 people was shot down as it came in to land at Sukhumi. The aircraft plunged into the sea short of the airport and the defence ministry has been unable to give details of the fate of those on board.</p>

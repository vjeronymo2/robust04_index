			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [by ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Georgiy Shmelev] </F>   [Text] Moscow March 1 TASS -- An agreement to unblock the  Tuzla airport with participation of international observers and  strict control over the delivery of humanitarian cargo is a new  major step towards political settlement in Bosnia, Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev told correspondents here today  upon the completion his negotiations with Bosnian Serb Leader  Radovan Karadzic.    Karadzic came to Moscow on Monday night [28 February] on the  Russian initiative for negotiations on Bosnian settlement.    The negotiations were very frank but difficult as the  problem  is complicated and the war has lasted for two years, said  Kozyrev. In his opinion, the peace initiative of Russian  President Boris Yeltsin has played an exclusively positive role  in settlement around Sarajevo as "it created conditions for a  crucial turn in regional developments".    Kozyrev plans to discuss with Boris Yeltsin the Russian  holding of operation at the Tuzla airport. He said the  agreement to the effect reached with the Serb side opens way to  more steps for regional settlement. Kozyrev hopes other states  will participate in negotiations with other parties to the  conflict in order to reach accord and compromises.    In his turn, Karadzic praised Yeltsin's initiative as a good  sign for other sides to follow the path of peaceful settlement.  He said Bosnian Serbs agree to open the Tuzla airport in the  immediate future for the delivery of humanitarian cargo. They  also want Russian observers to control non-military uses of the  airport, which, in the words of Karadzic, correspond to wishes  of representatives of the U.N. secretary-general and the  European Union in former Yugoslavia.    A statement for the press issued by the sides notes that the  arrival of Russian peace-makers in the area of Sarajevo and  precise and objective fulfilment of their duty as part of the  U.N. Protection Force in former Yugoslavia are a weighty and  stabilizing contribution that creates prerequisites for  normalization in Sarajevo and around it.    The Bosnian Serb leader welcomed the Russian president's  initiative to hold a summit in Moscow in order to reach the  soonest peace agreement, settle crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina  and lift sanctions against former Yugoslavia.    When discussing the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the  Russian side stressed the need for maximum restraint and full  cooperation with the U.N., says the statement.</p>

			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> California has dumped 100 to 200 unsupervised prison inmates each month for the  last three years in the Reno area without any notice, state and local officials  have charged. Nevada Atty. Gen. Brian McKay said, "It's a crappy way to conduct  law enforcement, especially between two sister states." He said he has called  California Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp to complain. The inmates are paroled  from the California Correction Facility in Susanville, hauled by van into Reno  to either the airport or the bus station where they are supposed to take  transportation to their homes -- usually the Los Angeles area. The inmates are  supposed to report to their parole officer in their hometowns the next day.  Dist. Atty. Mills Lane and Reno Police Chief Robert Bradshaw, in a Reno  Gazette-Journal article, said a person just passing through can commit a crime  and run. "Those people are almost impossible to catch," Lane said.  </P></p>

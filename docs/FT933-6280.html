			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets: Good results, political action lift China shares - Zhang Tingting on the Shanghai/Shenzhen rallies China B shares in Shanghai and Shenzhen have staged a strong comeback recently after months of decline. Since early August, and after a good day for share prices yesterday, the Credit Lyonnais Securities Shanghai B-share index has risen by 20.4 per cent to 754.56 and its Shenzhen B counterpart by 16.3 per cent to 947.86. In Shanghai, the birthplace of both China's communists (1921) and its first capitalist stock exchange (1990), trading in B shares, which foreigners can buy, hit a record high of Dollars 2.24m in average daily turnover in the second week of August after the inception of H shares in Hong Kong in July: the H shares, listed in the colony, were in four state-run enterprises from mainland China. Mr Andrew Leung, a China analyst at Smith New Court in Hong Kong, attributes the Shanghai rallies to the encouraging interim results from several companies and the rumours that three of the 12 B share companies - Shanghai Tyre and Rubber, Chlor-Alkali and No 2 Textile Machinery - are applying for American Depository Receipts. The profits news apparently triggered bargain hunting, overseas investors believing that B shares had bottomed out after dropping near to a single digit price/earnings ratio. In addition, there was action to stabilise the Chinese currency by Mr Zhu Rongji, China's vice-premier in charge of economic reform, who took over in July as governor of the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank. His support for the yuan against the US dollar also helped boost B shares, which are quoted and traded in dollar terms. Citibank of the US, one of the pioneers in China's equity markets, missed out on the recent share price recovery. But Mr William Calvert, one of its Far East investment managers in London, is not too unhappy. The US investment bank bought Dollars 500,000 of China's first batch of B shares in February, 1992, when the country opened its new equity markets to foreigners. It sold out with 'fantastic profits' last year though Shanghai dropped by about 50 per cent at one point on expectations of a government clampdown on the overheated economy. B shares have their drawbacks. Mr Calvert says that even Shanghai, generally perceived as hosting higher quality companies than Shenzhen, comes 'very low down the list' in Citibank's current exploration of emerging markets. The limited number of B shares available - 12 in Shanghai and 17 in Shenzhen so far - make liquidity a problem. And this is exacerbated by the fact that most of the shares, floated by placings, are in the hands of managers of about 30 China funds which have mushroomed during the China craze of the past year. Consequently, a small buying or selling interest is able to move a price sharply. Investors in China's B share markets are not afforded the same legal protection as they would get in Hong Kong where the newly listed H shares, says Mr Leung, are 'exposed to basically the same political and economic risks as the B shares inside China'. All B share companies, too, still feature dual accounting systems - international accounting standards (IAS) are compulsory for final results and optional for interim results. Last year, results were published in the Chinese accounting style and in the Chinese language a week before the English version, compiled according to international standards, presenting severe problems for foreign analysts. Transparency is low: relevant information has traditionally been regarded as secret, and liable to weaken the company's position if obtained by its competitors. The fact that the government has a controlling stake in all listed companies gives rise to concern among overseas investors over politically-appointed management and questions about its competence, directly affecting equity market performance. In spite of these problems, China continues to attract long-term investors as a potential economic superpower and centre of growth in the coming decades. 'They're fully aware of the risks and are prepared to take them,' says Mr Guy Stevinson, a broker with Standard Chartered Securities. Most observers believe the current central government's attention to Shanghai's development and reform will allow the city to realise the dream of restoring its past glory as a major financial centre in East Asia, while Shenzhen will develop toward a merger with Hong Kong after 1997, when Britain returns the territory to China. According to Mr Li Chuwen, an adviser to the Shanghai municipal government, its turnover in all shares (A shares for domestic investors and B shares for overseas) reached Rmb76bn (Dollars 13bn) last year and is expected to hit Rmb300bn by the end of this year. Shanghai plans to be number two Far East stock exchange to Japan in terms of annual turnover by 1995, he said.</p>

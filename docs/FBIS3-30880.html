This year 25 joint operations on the territory of the two  states will take place, Ruhe told journalists. "Usually this  sort of event is staged only in the second or third year of  cooperation. This illustrates the accelerated contacts between  the two countries' armed forces," he added.    The ministers are proposing an exchange of experts, not  units  or joint maneuvers. The general staffs are to discuss the  exchange of units, Andrejcak said. Ruhe said that Slovak and  German troops would probably first meet in Poland to where they  had been invited.    The Slovak Army will consult Bundeswehr experts regarding  the  creation of a task force brigade.</p>

			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Senior Labour officials round on Edmonds SENIOR Labour party officials yesterday moved to isolate Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union, Britain's second largest union, who has launched a co-ordinated campaign against what he believes is the shadow cabinet's lack of vision. Mr Edmonds, who believes that not all of the shadow cabinet are pulling their weight, used his party's annual congress in Portsmouth, Hampshire, as the launch pad for his attack on the Labour movement. While Mr Edmonds did not name individuals, Labour party officials interpreted the criticism as a damaging public attack on Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, from one of the union leaders whose block votes ensured his victory in last autumn's leadership election. An official said: 'John Edmonds has overstepped the mark. There is bad blood between him and the whole leadership. The Labour movement will not forgive him if he provides material for John Major to use in the debate on Conservative policies in the Commons on Wednesday.' Mr Edmonds, delivering the keynote speech on the first day of the congress, said that Mr Smith called for radical and popular policies and he was right. 'That is what we in the Labour movement should offer now - not a little bit more of this or a little bit less of that.' Mr Edmonds said that every trade unionist, every Labour councillor and every member of the Labour party front bench should be voicing arguments against the government's policies. He said: 'Caution and prudence have their place in politics but we should never allow the limits of Labour's ambitions to be set by an economic framework laid down by the Tories.' In an article in the Sunday Mirror, Mr Edmonds was less veiled in his criticism. He warned that unless the Labour movement started 'punching now' it would lose the next general election. He said that since the election the knock-out blows against the government had not come from the Labour party. 'We seem to be holding back and waiting for the Tories to destroy themselves. The Labour movement still seems dazed from last year's general election defeat.' Mr Edmonds says he has discovered widespread disillusionment and discontent among union activists in recent months. He is also a leading opponent of changes planned for the party's internal decision-making. Mr Smith, speaking on BBC Radio 4, dismissed the criticism of his party and said that the 24-point lead in opinion polls proved that the party was doing a good job.</p>

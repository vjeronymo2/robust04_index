The report said the figure indicates that the Health and  Welfare Ministry's attempt to encourage a nationwide system of  base hospitals as a key element of its anti-AIDS strategy is  still incomplete.    A ministry team studying the epidemiology of AIDS made the  finding after compiling results from 688 responses received by  mid-January to questionnaires sent out in November to the 848  centers.    The ministry found that 688 centers or 81 percent of the  total responded to the survey. Of the respondents, 675 or 98  percent offered an AIDS-related telephone inquiry service and  633, or 92 percent, offered AIDS-related interviews.    But the ministry said only 555, or 81 percent, of the  centers  knew of hospitals to which they could refer AIDS patients or  people who were infected with the AIDS-causing human  immunodeficiency virus (HIV).    The ministry has requested each prefecture to stipulate at  least two hospitals which can serve as centers for the treatment  of AIDS but by late January only four prefectures had complied.</p>

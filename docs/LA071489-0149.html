			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MORE BITES  </P> <P> The following are summaries of recent Times restaurant reviews.  </P> <P> Mayur, 2931 E. Coast Highway, Corona del Mar. (714) 675-6622. Open Mondays  through Fridays 11:30 a.m. to 2:30, 5:30 to 11:30; Saturdays 5:30 to 11:30,  Sundays noon to 11:30.  </P> <P> Breads like naan and aijwan paratha are perfect, steaming from the tandoor.  Fish tikka comes dripping spice. Lamb vindaloo, a Goan preparation with  vinegar, chili and potato, is hot, fragrant and well balanced. Be wary of the  oily vegetable dishes and the unctuous service.  </P> <P> Spaghettini, 3005 Old Ranch Parkway, Seal Beach. (213) 596-2199. Open Mondays  through Fridays 11 a.m. to 3:30, 4:30 to 10; Saturdays noon to 3:30, 4:30 to  10:30; Sundays noon to 3:30, 4:30 to 9:30.  </P> <P>  A swank Seal Beach grill and pasta house, Spaghettini gets by largely on  beauty: The food is somewhat spotty. Appetizers have little character, but  pizzas are full grown and yeasty, fresh from an oak-burning brick oven. Pastas  are made fresh daily but are not necessarily well prepared. Linguini clams  turns out to be a bowl of sticky glop. It's best to stick with items from the  restaurant's mesquite grill, like the perfectly blackened veal chop or the  excellent mixed grill.  </P> <P> El Ranchito, 1351H Beach Boulevard, La Habra. (213) 943-6020. Open Sundays  through Thursdays 11 a.m. to 9 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays till 10 p.m.  </P> <P>  Manana, 17171 Brookhurst St., Fountain Valley. (714) 963-8673. Open Mondays  through Thursdays 11 a.m. to 10 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays till 11 p.m.  </P> <P>  La Salsa, Irvine Ranch Farmers Market, Fashion Island, Newport Beach ((714)  640-4289) and Santa Ana MainPlace ((714) 543-9524). Open from 9 to 9 weekdays,  11 to 9 weekends.  </P> <P>  Everyone, it seems, has his secret Mexican haunt, where the chilies are hotter  or the tortillas fresher. El Ranchito is the place for carnitas, chunked pork  marinated in lemon and garlic, and for some of the most toothsome handmade  tortillas in the area. Larry Cano's Manana specializes in fajitas, giant  portions that easily feed two, loaded with trimmed meats, red and yellow  peppers, tomatoes and carmelized onion. Best of all is La Salsa, a humble food  stand dispensing antojitos, soft tacos, quesadillas and Mexican sandwiches.  Meats here are impeccable, accompaniments rapturous.  </P> <P> Gemmell's, 3000 Bristol St., Costa Mesa. (714) 751-1074. Open Mondays through  Fridays 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., Mondays through Saturdays 6 to 10:30 p.m.  </P> <P>  You've seen it all before: the quiet, understated rooms, the tables draped  like ballroom gowns, the silver domes, the brandy cart. At Gemmell's, thank  heaven, it all makes sense. Treat yourself to an evening here, feasting on such  specialties as goose liver wrapped in blackened cabbage, lobster in Sauteres,  veal chop with morels. Chef Byron Gemmell has a carefuly designed menu with  nearly every item on it worthy of praise. Prepare to pay handsomely for the  privlege of praising.  </P> <P> McCormick and Schmick, 2000 Main St., Irvine. (714) 756-0505. Open Mondays  through Fridays 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., Saturdays 5 p.m. to 11 p.m., Sundays 5 p.m.  to 10 p.m.  </P> <P>  McCormick and Schmick is the latest member of an exclusive chain that started  in the Pacific Northwest, a slick, muscular operation specializing in fresh  seafoods, and the food is terrific. Oysters like Quilicene, Olympia, Golden  Mantle, and Skookum taste as if they have just been dragged from the sea. Fish  like Copper River salmon in cream wiith bay scallops, or sea bass with Jamaican  spices, are good enough to make a grown man weep. Non-fish eaters can feast on  marinated chicken, or Cajun cheeseburgers. Head of the class.  </P> <P> China Palms, Fullerton Metro Center, 104 W. Orangethorpe Ave., Fullerton. (714)  526-2196. Open daily from 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m.  </P> <P>  Joe Ling put a palm tree in the middle of his restaurant, an airy,  ultra-modern dining room in Fullerton's spanking new Metro Center. But there is  nothing tropical about the solid pan-Chinese food he serves, made in one of the  most accomplished Chinese kitchens around. Cold dishes, dumplings and  first-rate soups make perfect beginnings. Honey-glazed bananas, plunged  steaming into an ice-filled bowl tableside, make perfect endings. The goodies  you can have in between are too numerous to mention.  </P> <P> sg  </P> <P> Yankee Tavern, 333 Bayside Drive, Newport Beach. (714) 675 5333. Open nightly  5:30 to midnight.  </P> <P>  Those who know Yankee Tavern owner Hans Prager as proprietor of the Ritz may  be surprised to see him in this urban roadhouse, catering to a crowd hungry for  low prices, speedy service and an unpretentious menu. The food here is almost  unfailingly good, though, in a cafeteria-style manner. Meat loaf, pot pie, lamb  shanks and fresh seafoods are featured.  </P></p>

			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / The Markets: Deficit criteria could prompt EU struggles - Economics Notebook It has been customary for policy-makers in the European Union to ignore or minimise awkward issues and then be surprised when market or political forces overwhelm their plans. This happened in 1992 and 1993 when member governments so underestimated the problems of ratifying the Maastricht Treaty and the impact of recession and divergent monetary policies on the European Monetary System that the EU was wracked by political and currency crises. Things may now be changing. Partly because of those events, and partly because the Maastricht Treaty includes tough rules against 'excessive deficits', officials in the European Commission and EU finance ministries and central banks are giving early thought to Europe's large fiscal deficits. Not only are the deficits a significant economic problem in their own right: they are emerging as the biggest economic (as opposed to political or technical) barrier to a move by member states to the third and final stage of economic and monetary union by the end of the century. They also have the potential for creating strains in the EU between anti-deficit hardliners, such as the Bundesbank, and those who see political advantages in a flexible approach to deficit reduction. The latest Commission forecast, published last week, highlights the problem. Under the Maastricht Treaty's convergence criteria, a country is supposed not to become an Emu member if its fiscal deficit exceeds 3 per cent of gross domestic product or its stock of government debt is more than 60 per cent of GDP. But, as the top chart shows, only three countries - Ireland, Luxembourg and Germany - will meet the deficit rule by the middle of the decade. The lower chart shows that a majority of EU members exceed the debt guideline, with four countries having stocks of debt of more than 50 per cent above the Maastricht limit, including Belgium and Italy, members of the original EEC. At present, 11 of the 12 member states appear to be running 'excessive deficits' as measured by the Maastricht criteria. Although Mr Henning Christophersen, the commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, has predicted that during 1997 a majority of present members should fulfil the criteria , it is hard to imagine Belgium, Italy, Greece and Ireland ever being able to meet the 60 per cent debt to GDP ratio. Relatively high real interest rates and typically moderate EU growth rates offer no escape from the debt trap. No-one is shedding tears for Greece, the EU's economic delinquent. But the political pressures to smooth the entry to Emu for Ireland, which meets all other Maastricht requirements, and Italy and Belgium are mounting. They could become especially powerful in Belgium's case if Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister, succeeds Mr Jacques Delors as commission president The treaty makes provision for the deficit and debt criteria to be disregarded in certain limited circumstances. The deficit guideline need not apply if the ratio 'has declined substantially and continuously' towards 3 per cent or the excess is 'only exceptional and temporary.' In both cases the ratio should be close to the guideline. The 60 per cent debt ratio can be disregarded if the actual ratio 'is sufficiently diminishing and approaching the reference value at a satisfactory pace.' It is less well known that the commission has important discretionary powers that could enable member states, which fail to meet the convergence criteria regarding the deficits and debt, to be exempt from the excessive deficit rule. Under the complex procedure for defining and acting upon excessive deficits, it is up to the council of economic and finance ministers to determine whether a country has an 'excessive deficit' that would bar it from Emu. But the council acts on a recommendation from the commission. According to article 104c paragraph 5 it is for the commission to decide if a given deficit is excessive and to address an 'opinion' about it to the council. If the commission provided no opinion, the ministers would have no basis for deciding whether the country was infringing the excessive deficit rules. The applicant country's membership of Emu could not be blocked on these grounds. These issues may seem arcane, especially if Emu turns out to be several years away (and may never come in Britain's case). But the excessive deficit procedure could be applied for the first time this year. Already some policy makers are trying to ease the impact of the rules. In Belgium's case there has been a suggestion that privatisation proceeds be counted towards the deficit reduction effort, even though this is technically not possible under the treaty, which measures deficits by the European system of national accounts. Earlier this year, Mr Christophersen touted the idea of liberal interpretation of the deficit and debt criteria so that countries such as Belgium would not be excluded from Emu. He told a Brussels seminar it had 'always been understood that the judgment on whether a member state fulfils the conditions for participation in stage 3 would be based on an assessment, and not on a mechanical application of the convergence criteria.' Remarks such as these have prompted angry responses from members of the Bundesbank central council, including Prof Reimut Jochimsen, the influential head of the state central bank in North Rhine Westphalia. Such rumblings could presage a greater storm. The commission looks as if it could land between a rock and a hard place. If it takes a hard line with the EU's debtors, and Belgium in particular, it will only advertise how far the EU countries are from achieving Emu. If it tries to bend the Maastricht criteria for political reasons, it risks running foul of the Bundesbank, other EU central banks and the German constitutional court.</p>

			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / The Lex Column: BTP/MTM By making its second rights issue in just over a year - this time to buy the assets of MTM - BTP is behaving like a growth stock. Yet the dividend will be increased again despite lower earnings per share and cover of less than 1.5 times. That entrenches the yield on the shares well above the market average. In a rational world there would be a case for BTP retaining more profit and making fewer rights issues. The presence on the share register of the ICI, British Rail and British Coal pension funds - institutions attached to real dividend growth - might explain its generosity. Since the shares rose 4 per cent yesterday against a falling market, keeping the institutions sweet has a logic of its own. That is not to deny the attractions of the deal with MTM. By declining to make a full bid, BTP has side-stepped any potential problems arising from MTM's murky past. Instead it gets much needed production capacity in the US and the chance to squeeze more from some under-worked assets. The Kirkby chemicals plant made a loss of Pounds 2.5m on sales of Pounds 3.3m last year, so some improvement should not be difficult. If BTP can deliver on its promise to move three loss-making businesses into profit within 6 months, the rights issue will not dilute earnings per share. The worry is whether BTP can manage the transition from small regional company to international group. If it can keep a firm grip, even the pension funds might come to accept less income and more capital growth.</p>

			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Bureaucrats cling to power: Tokyo civil servants believe reform will fail to curb their role At a meeting with journalists earlier this month, a senior bureaucrat at one of the more influential ministries was asked whether the current political uncertainty in Japan was adversely affecting the execution of policy. The facial expression of pained bewilderment at the naivete of the questioner was more eloquent than the answer itself: 'The government may change,' responded the nation's servant, 'but the policy remains the same.' It was a disarmingly candid admission, even from a Japanese bureaucrat. But in the current crisis, it neatly highlights the largely unchanged distribution of power in the Japanese political system. The collapse of 38 years of Liberal Democratic party rule last summer was thought by many to herald also the end of civil service power. The new prime minister, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, pledged to redress the balance between the bureaucrats and elected politicians. In the years of LDP rule a cosy proximity had built up between the ministers and the functionaries who nominally served them. With ministers moving rapidly between jobs, often in place as a result of political favours rather than talent or experience, the scope to dominate was considerable for the bureaucrats - a highly educated cadre. But the end of the LDP hegemony has not brought with it a substantial decline in the bureaucrats' power. Some even argue that it has been enhanced. In the words of one political analyst: 'The political crisis has distracted the politicians from the business of governing; the bureaucracy has been left to get on with its own business of running the country.' The Ministry of Finance sits at the pinnacle of the country's power structure. Mr Jiro Saito, the respected vice-minister (the top civil servant), at the ministry has spent most of the last year fighting for an increase in consumption tax to offset the fiscal effect of the large income tax cuts that take effect this summer. His attempts to secure the tax increase were rebuffed in February when the socialists (then members of the coalition) resisted it. But Mr Saito continued the battle, and last week he was reappointed for a rare second year in his post. Few of his colleagues expect the ministry to lose. But bureaucrats do not enjoy untrammeled power, as Mr Saito's earlier setback suggests, and some analysts believe their role is about to diminish. Mr Douglas Ostrom, at the Japan Economic Institute, points out: 'Bureaucrats disagree with one another and are reluctant to initiate substantial policy shifts on their own - politicians need to do the dirty work of brokering agreements and selling proposals.' And the long-awaited deregulation of Japan's economy will take away many of the bureaucrats' functions. So far, however, there has been little substantive progress in translating the widespread desire for deregulation into action. And only those measures with the bureaucrats' blessing have been enacted. The political reforms enacted in the last year may yet also bring about a decline in the ministries' power. When an election is held under the new rules the current instability may give way to a government, legitimised by a majority, and committed to reform. But the bureaucrats are, as yet, untroubled. They accept the arguments for political and institutional reform, but they do not believe it will seriously diminish their role. Their justification is simple: the system works. They played a big part in bringing about the Japanese economic miracle and, though tarnished of late, they argue the miracle is still intact.</p>

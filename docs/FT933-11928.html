Turnover grew by Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 80.2m. The advance in profits arose exclusively from favourable movement in currency rates, the company said. Operating profits were up 11.2 per cent, from Pounds 4.35m to Pounds 4.82m, representing a margin of 9.7 per cent (9.2 per cent). The accounts have been prepared on an FRS 3 basis and the prior year figures incorporate costs previously reported as exceptional items. Interest charges increased to Pounds 3.09m (Pounds 2.81m). Net debt was Pounds 65.2m, a rise of Pounds 3.1m during the six months. Because of over-provision for foreign taxes there is no tax charge this time. Earnings per share came out at 1.7p (0.9p).</p>

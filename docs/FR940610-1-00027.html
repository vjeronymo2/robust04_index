			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On November 13, 1992, the State of West Virginia also requested that EPA redesignate the Parkersburg, West Virginia area to attainment with respect to the ozone NAAQS. In addition, on February 28, 1994, West Virginia submitted an update to its November 13, 1992 submittal, collectively referred to hereafter as the ``State of West Virginia's redesignation request.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Evaluation Criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> According to section 107(d)(3)(E) of the Act, five specific requirements must be met in order for EPA to redesignate an area from nonattainment to attainment:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The area must have attained the applicable NAAQS;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The area has met all relevant requirements under section 110 and part D of the Act;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The area has a fully approved SIP under section 110(k) of the Act;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The air quality improvement must be permanent and enforceable; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The area must have a fully approved maintenance plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pursuant to section 175A of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Review of West Virginia's Submittal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State of West Virginia's redesignation request for the Parkersburg, West Virginia area included information and documentation sufficient for EPA to determine that the five requirements of section 107, noted above have been met. Following is a brief description of how the each of these requirements has been fulfilled. Because the maintenance plan is a critical element of the redesignation request, EPA will discuss its evaluation of the maintenance plan under its analysis of the redesignation request. A Technical Support Document (TSD) has also been prepared by EPA on these rulemaking actions. That TSD is available for public inspection at the EPA Regional Office listed in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  section of this document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Attainment of the Ozone NAAQS <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The submittal contains an analysis of ozone air quality data which is relevant to the maintenance plan and to the redesignation request. Ambient ozone monitoring data for 1989 through 1991 show attainment of the ozone NAAQS in the Parkersburg, West Virginia area. See 40 CFR 50.9 and appendix H. The State of West Virginia's redesignation request included documentation that the Parkersburg, West Virginia ozone nonattainment area has complete, quality-assured data showing attainment of the standard over the most recent consecutive three calendar year period. Therefore, the Parkersburg, West Virginia area has met the first statutory criterion for redesignation to attainment of the ozone NAAQS found at section 107(d)(3)(E)(i) of the Act. It is important to note that EPA has also reviewed the ozone data monitored during the 1992 and 1993 ozone seasons in the Parkersburg area and determined that no violations of the standard were monitored during those years. Therefore, there have been no violations of the ozone standard monitored in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Parkersburg area since the 1988 ozone season.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Meeting Applicable Requirements of Section 110 and Part D  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As previously stated, EPA fully approved the State of West Virginia SIP for the Parkersburg, West Virginia area as meeting the requirements of section 110(a)(2) and part D of the 1977 Act. The amended Act, however, modified section 110(a)(2) and, under part D, revised section 172 and added new requirements for all nonattainment areas. Therefore, for purposes of redesignation, EPA has reviewed the SIP to ensure that it contains all measures that were due under the Act as of November 13, 1992, the date the State of West Virginia submitted its redesignation request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2.A. Section 110 Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although section 110 of the 1977 Act was amended in 1990, the Parkersburg, West Virginia SIP meets the requirements of section 110(a)(2) of the amended Act. A number of the requirements did not change in substance and, therefore, EPA believes that the pre-amendment SIP met these requirements. As to those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements that were amended, See 57 FR 27936 and 23939 (June 23, 1993), many are duplicative of other requirements of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

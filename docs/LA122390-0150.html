			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PERILS OF PANAMA;  </P> <P> IN THE TIME OF THE TYRANTS; PANAMA: 1968-1990 BY R. M. KOSTER AND GUILLERMO  SANCHEZ (W.W. NORTON: $22.95; 430 PP.)  </P> <P> In Panama they are called bolas, rumors that spread daily if not hourly through  the society. Someone has died, another is sleeping with a friend's wife, a  politician is planning a coup. One vice president nearly punched the other vice  president during a cabinet meeting. Bolas touch on nearly every aspect of  Panamanian life.  </P> <P> Some bolas are funny, others meaningless, but many are taken seriously in  Panama, so seriously that they frequently turn into the myths that too often  become the basis of journalism or, worse, pass for history.  </P> <P> A major example is the myth of Omar Torrijos, the handsome and dashing  Panamanian colonel who held power from the late 1960s until his death in 1981.  The myth of Torrijos is that he was a populist who took on the rich, white  Panamanian establishment and the imperialist United States to bring the poor  people of his country out of misery and to establish the political and economic  independence for his nation by wresting the Panama Canal from the giant to the  north.  </P> <P> It was a myth bought by the British writer Graham Greene, President Jimmy  Carter and many others. The truth was otherwise, as pointed out in "In the Time  of the Tyrants."  </P> <P> In what is the most valuable aspect of this book, the authors carefully remind  a forgetful world that Torrijos was not a George Washington-like hero but an  unstable colonel who, in the late 1960s with American complicity and approval,  established and cemented military rule in Panama and defined its brutal and  criminal nature.  </P> <P> Koster and Sanchez also effectively explain that Torrijos' supposed greatest  achievement -- new treaties giving sovereignty and control of the Panama Canal  to Panama -- fell far short of what could have been accomplished, and even gave  the United States rights it already had renounced.  </P> <P> "In the Time of the Tyrants" contains some other positive aspects. With the  United States still congratulating itself on throwing out Manuel Antonio  Noriega a year ago and destroying the military structure that brutalized, raped  and plundered Panama, Koster and Sanchez remind us again not only that Noriega  was a paid agent of the American government but also that high U.S. officials  -- including Presidents Reagan and Bush -- condoned, protected and publicly  praised the dictator through most of his murderous rule.  </P> <P> And as the Bush Administration, for its own political needs, pushes Panama to  participate in Washington's war on drugs, even though it threatens the  Panamanian economy and raises the specter of a militarized police force, "In  the Time of the Tyrants" recalls how the United States for its own ends created  a military institution unneeded by a peaceful society unable to protect itself.  </P> <P> Yet while Koster and Sanchez demolish the myth of Torrijos and point out the  hypocrisy of American policy regarding Noriega, much of what is valuable in  this book is offset by the excesses and faults of the authors, particularly the  portrayal of unsubstantiated gossip and rumors as facts. Their well-grounded  disgust with and hate for Torrijos and Noriega has led Koster and Sanchez to  perpetuate or create other bolas and myths unacceptable in serious journalism.  </P> <P> What is sad is that the confirmed record of Torrijos, Noriega and the United  States is so awful it needs no embellishment.  </P> <P> For instance, in their central allegory of Noriega's total depravity -- the  1985 murder by beheading of Dr. Hugo Spadafora, one of the dictator's most  dangerous opponents -- Koster and Sanchez repeat accounts that Spadafora had  been tortured and anally raped, and that Noriega's henchmen had cut his thigh  muscles to prevent him from resisting. However, as John Dinges wrote earlier  this year in "Our Man In Panama," which remains the most responsible and  authoritative account of recent Panamanian history, an autopsy by an  independent Costa Rican doctor showed no signs of sexual abuse or torture.  </P> <P> Worse, Koster and Sanchez refer to Dinges as an apologist for Noriega, an  absurd assertion to anyone who has read Dinges' book.  </P> <P> The Spadafora murder stands on its own as an example of Noriega's depravity.  There is no need to make him out as an even greater monster, particularly by  using unsubstantiated rumors. In their loathing for Noriega and those American  officials who supported and helped him, Koster and Sanchez also give total  credence to the unconfirmed accounts of at least two former Noriega associates  who turned on their onetime master as part of a plea bargain: political  operative Jose Blandon and convicted money launderer Ramon Milian Rodriguez,  described by the U.S. attorney's office in Miami as "wholly without  credibility." As for Blandon, Dinges wrote: "Although Blandon undisputably had  a major political role in Panamanian events and had inside knowledge of many  major events in Panama, a significant number of his allegations defy  confirmation and in some cases are implausible or demonstrably false."  </P> <P> Again, the public and confirmed record against Noriega is so strong that it  doesn't need the use of suspect and unsubstantiated testimony from special  pleaders.  </P> <P> With the anniversary of the U.S. invasion of Panama having just passed, this  would be a good time for a serious examination of the reasons for the American  action and its impact since. For the most part, "In the Time of the Tyrants"  fails on both counts. It provides neither new information nor insight into the  events that led to the Dec. 20, 1989, American attack nor a thoughtful look at  the effects and implications of that drastic act.  </P> <P> All of this is a surprise and a disappointment. Guillermo Sanchez is one of  Panama's most influential journalists, a man who bravely and constantly exposed  the barbarities, crimes and betrayals of the uniformed thugs and their civilian  front men who ruled his country for more than 20 years. Few knew more and even  fewer disclosed what was going on in the country, a knowledge he continues to  display in a column for La Prensa, Panama's best newspaper.  </P> <P> For his part, R.M. Koster, a longtime American resident of Panama, had a  well-earned reputation as a writer, having published a engrossing novel in 1972  called "The Prince," which was an amazingly prescient portrayal of a banana  republic taken over by venal military men and turned into a center of  corruption.  </P> <P> On their records, Koster and Sanchez not only could have written a better book,  they should have.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDICIAL PANEL  </P> <P> Your editorial ("Overprotected Judiciary," Dec. 29) concerning the shields  erected by judges to safeguard themselves against public criticism is not only  very well taken, but it hardly goes far enough.  </P> <P> The Commission on Judicial Performance is not merely inadequate, it is  incompetent, for the reason that it merely responds to criticisms (and  criticisms from mere citizens count for nothing). The commission does nothing  to maintain a standard of quality. It should patrol the courts and weed out  incompetent judges. The way things work now, each judge is a law unto himself,  with very little recourse for his victims. A judge can violate more laws in a  year than a professional criminal can in a lifetime. And no one can do anything  about him.  </P> <P> But, indeed, you must get after the federal courts. These judges cannot be  replaced no matter how incompetent they might be. Inevitably they are even  worse than state judges, for they really are above the law. It is human nature  that meek, considerate persons become curmudgeons when the President anoints  them with the gift of infallibility.  </P> <P> It is a vestige of "the divine rights of kings" and it should end!  </P> <P> ARTHUR L. JOHNSON  </P> <P> San Francisco  </P></p>

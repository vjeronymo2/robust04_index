			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAJOR CONSERVATION EFFORT OUTLINED BY ENERGY DEPT.  </P> <P> In a turnaround from the Ronald Reagan years, the Bush Administration announced  Friday what it called a major energy conservation initiative that emphasizes  searching for alternative fuels -- solar power, ethanol and hydropower -- while  offering symbolic gestures, such as reducing lighting needs in federal  buildings.  </P> <P> "This is the first major conservation initiative in the Bush Administration and  maybe in a decade," Deputy Energy Department Secretary W. Henson Moore said of  the six-year, $336-million program.  </P> <P> The plan, which Moore said "goes into effect today" and will be financed this  year by $30 million shifted from other department programs, met with guarded  approval by environmental and conservation groups.  </P> <P> "Overall, we're encouraged by what we're hearing. They are saying a lot of the  right things," said Mark Ledbetter, a senior associate at the American Council  for an Energy Efficient Economy.  </P> <P> The approach represents a marked reversal from the Reagan Administration,  during which federal support for conservation and renewal energy sources  withered.  </P> <P> The initiative includes programs intended to reduce the cost of ethanol  production, to encourage ways of using concentrated solar energy to break down  toxic wastes and to search for effective ways to convert more municipal waste  into energy.  </P> <P> Moore said that if the different programs were successful, annual reductions of  800 million tons in carbon dioxide emissions, a gas contributing to the  "greenhouse effect," and 2.3 million tons in sulfur dioxide, an acid rain  pollutant, could be reached. The reductions would be roughly 20% of what is  called for in the President's Clean Air Act amendments, according to the Energy  Department.  </P> <P> The initiative also is allocating $19.6 million to construct a laboratory at  the government's Solar Energy Research Institute in Golden, Colo., to be  devoted to research in solar-electric and solar-heat technologies.  </P> <P> Under the initiative, the DOE also will attempt to "define the developable  (hydropower) capacity" at existing dam sites throughout the country. Moore  acknowledged that environmental concerns have significantly stifled hydropower  development, which he called "the most proven and developed of all" renewable  sources of energy.  </P> <P> By the year 2000, Moore said, the initiative "could produce cumulative savings  of up to $32 billion, from an investment of $336 million. That's a return of  almost 100 to 1."  </P> <P> But Ledbetter questioned the claim of that "phenomenal" return. "It makes me a  little suspicious," he said.  </P> <P> For months, senior DOE officials have been promoting the conservation  initiative as a major prelude to the development of a long-term "national  energy strategy." Ordered last July by President Bush, the strategy is intended  to ensure that the country will have adequate supplies of clean, competitively  priced energy well into the next century.  </P> <P> Since then, Energy Secretary James D. Watkins has been holding public hearings  around the country, often with other senior Cabinet officials presiding as  co-hosts, in an attempt to forge a national consensus.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> LIGHTS FAIL AT WAYNE AIRPORT  </P> <P> Hundreds of passengers were stranded after Orange County's John Wayne Airport  shut down when rainfall knocked out new runway lights, officials said. All  incoming flights were diverted to Ontario and Los Angeles International  airports, and outgoing flights were canceled. A spokesman for American Airlines  said the airport closure forced the carrier to re-route seven flights carrying  a total of 300 to 400 passengers. Delta Airlines re-routed two flights. At  least three American Airlines flights were diverted to Ontario. The blackout,  which affected only the runway lights, was blamed on the weather, as a new  system of fixtures and cables encountered its first storm and apparently  suffered water damage, airport spokeswoman Kathie Rutherford said. The airport  was closed for almost an hour Sunday evening after a faulty Southern California  Edison cable cut power to the runway and about 1,800 airport area residents.  </P></p>

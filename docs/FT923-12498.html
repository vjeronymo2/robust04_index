			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / UK Company News: European lifeline for MMI MUNICIPAL MUTUAL Insurance, the stricken insurer owned by UK local authorities, has reached agreement in principle to transfer its business to a group of European mutual companies headed by France's Groupe Mutuelle des Fonctionnaires. No details of the financing have been made available, but MMI's net assets had declined to only Pounds 4.9m at the end of last year, compared with Pounds 287.9m at the end of 1990. MMI, the ninth biggest insurer in the UK which underwrote premium income of Pounds 784.9m in 1991, expanded aggressively in the late 1980s but has been overwhelmed by heavy losses. Underwriting losses at its two operating subsidiaries, Municipal General and Muncipal Mutual, amounted to Pounds 225.6m in 1991. Municipal Mutual, which insures over 80 per cent of UK local authorities, was forced to increase its reserves for future claims on employers' liability and public liability policies. Mr Brian Wright, the former group executive director of Sun Alliance, and UBS Phillips and Drew have been helping MMI find a buyer since early May. A number of UK companies, including Sun Alliance and Eagle Star, examined the company's books but opted to take their interest no further. GMF is among France's ten largest general insurers and also has extensive interests in retail, communications, vineyards, travel and tourism. Its premium income amounted to Fr9.8bn. It is part of the Eurosafe group of European public service insurers, which also includes HUK Coburg of Germany and SMAP of Belgium.</p>

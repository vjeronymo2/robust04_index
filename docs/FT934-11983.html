			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: UBS optimistic after 'impressive' third quarter UNION Bank of Switzerland, the country's largest bank, said it continued to show an 'impressive performance' in the third quarter, and added that the outlook for the full year was still encouraging. No figures were given. The bank said that while the third quarter was normally relatively quiet, earnings at both group and parent company levels were only slightly lower than the highs reported for the preceding quarter. The bank earlier reported first-half consolidated net income of SFr1.29bn (Dollars 871.6m), up 89 per cent. Units outside Switzerland continued to contribute substantially in the third quarter. In the first half, they accounted for 40 per cent of group net income. All divisions had a significant upturn in earnings in the nine months. The improvement in trading income was 'particularly striking', while credit-related business grew more slowly because of the recession. General expenses grew moderately, personnel costs substantially, and provisions for doubtful debts were still 'very high', especially in respect of Swiss customers. UBS said that the growth of cashflow in the second half was likely to be lower than the very high rate reported in the first half, reflecting the fact that cashflow in the second half of last year was significantly higher than that in the first. Parent company assets stood at SFr217.9bn at the end of September, 1 per cent higher than at the end of June. Securities holdings jumped 17 per cent to SFr23.4bn, while customer loans were off 1 per cent to SFr138.8bn.</p>

Thus, days on which meteorological conditions interfere with achieving the 2 ppt criteria at Roe Island would be counted instead as days of meeting the criteria upstream at Chipps Island. This approach could be applied only until all days that are required at the upstream site are met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. As a part of EPA's coordination process in developing this proposal, the Agency has discussed its proposed criteria at length with the operators of California's major water projects. These operators, who will have substantial responsibilities under any implementation plan developed by the State Board, raised a question about how compliance with the 2 ppt salinity criteria should be measured. Under existing operational models, these operators would translate the proposed criteria into a set of flow parameters, and would operate the system pursuant to those flow parameters so as to achieve the 2 ppt salinity criteria at the targeted sites. However, because all models contain imperfections, it has been proposed that the operators should actually model compliance at a site somewhat downstream of the targeted site so as to provide a ``margin of error'' or a ``confidence interval''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's preliminary review of this issue suggests that use of a ``confidence interval'' of this kind is unwarranted, for two primary reasons. First, the model that predicts the location of the 2 ppt isohaline based on flows is extremely accurate. EPA's preliminary review of the model's accuracy during the five months covered by the proposed salinity criteria, using historical data, found that the model correctly predicts the number of days for the isohaline position more than 95 percent of the time. Second, the use of a 28 day averaging period, as described above, would adequately address most of the variability associated with factors not included in the salinity-flow model. For these reasons, EPA believes that the use of these proposed confidence intervals would require substantial additional flows through the estuary without any corresponding ecological benefit to the Estuarine Habitat designated use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA expects that the State Board will develop an implementation plan for these Estuarine Habitat criteria by changing the volume and timing of water flows through the estuary. EPA believes that an implementation plan that relies on the salinity-flow model, without making additional allowances for confidence intervals as described above, would be acceptable for purposes of protecting the designated use. Further, EPA notes that the State's triennial review provides a mechanism for regularly reviewing the adequacy of any implementation decisions concerning confidence intervals for the proposed salinity criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA solicits comment from the public on this issue, and welcomes any evaluation on the merits of the use of this or other forms of confidence intervals with the proposed criteria. Specifically, EPA requests comment on whether the proposed criteria without the above confidence interval adjustment would be protective. Alternatively, would a confidence interval based on an extended number of days of compliance at the targeted sites yield the desired level of confidence without requiring the higher flows required by the confidence interval proposal outlined above?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Will these criteria be adequate to protect low-salinity habitat conditions in wetter years? The SFEP workshop that developed the scientific rationale for an estuarine index based their conclusions on correlations between mean position of the 2 ppt isohaline during appropriate months and the abundance of estuarine organisms at all trophic levels. With the exception of mollusks, yearly measures of abundance increase either linearly or logarithmically as the mean location of the 2 ppt isohaline moves down the estuary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has developed its proposed Estuarine Habitat criteria based on the number of days at particular locations in the estuary, rather than a mean position over a series of months. These criteria have the advantage of being more easily implemented, and more directly tie certain salinity ranges to certain geographic locations (such as the extensive shallows of Grizzly Bay). However, basing the number of days on a certain historical period (such as 1940 to 1975) does not mean that the mean position of the 2 ppt isohaline for these reference years will be achieved. By using the historical period of 1940 to 1975 to define the number of days at each location, we are approximating the actual historical (late 1960's to early 1970's) mean position of the 2 ppt isohaline in drier years. However, EPA's criteria may not provide overall conditions equal to those during the late 1960's to early 1970's. This is because the mean position of the 2 ppt isohaline in wetter years has been substantially downstream of the wetter year positions in the proposed rule (see Table below).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 6,L2,i1,s100,5,5,5,5,5 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> Mean Position, in km, of the February Through June  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> 2  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> ppt Isohaline, by Year Type, for  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> 1940&hyph;1975  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> Historical Period and Late  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> 1960's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> to Early  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> 1970's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> Historical Period (Based on DAYFLOW Information and the Salinity/Flow Relationship Developed by Kimmerer and Monismith; SFEP  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> 1993 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> b), and EPA Criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Year type  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1C  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1D  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1BN  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1AN  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1W <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=4 --> 1940&hyph;1975 <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 70  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 67  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 59  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 56  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1964&hyph;1975 <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->   <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 74  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 73  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 62  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 59  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA criteria_with trigger9  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 77  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 73  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 70  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 67  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 65  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA criteria_without trigger  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 77  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 76  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 75  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 74  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 74  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0146 intable --> 9The EPA criteria include the Roe Island criteria with its ``trigger'', which in some years will not be triggered.

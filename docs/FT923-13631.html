			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Gardening: A leaf from the BR songbook TODAY and tomorrow is the grand finale of the Hampton Court Flower Show. Exhibitors have continued to multiply in ever more marquees and the occasion has the same strength as last year's show, its coming of age. Do not expect a second Chelsea: none of the exhibits aims or arrives at quite the same magnificence. The great distinction of this show is that it gives you a better chance to view and shop on the spot. Dozens of smaller exhibitors who do not come to Chelsea bring their stock for display and disposal. Shopping is continuous and, once again, I have returned with plastic bags filled with plants which I could not bear to miss, although I did not set out wanting them in the first place. Peach-coloured Alonsoa and the pale yellow variety of Potentilla Recta are not options which float into the grasp of keen plant finders every day of the week. There is one fact which may make you hesitate before setting out to join the fray: last year, 458,000 people descended on the site. When the public is swarming, it is hard to remain consistent: last year, I tried to arrive by car, warned you strongly against the inevitable jams but ended by buying so much that I also advised you to pack it all into the car boot. This year, the jams have arguably been worse. The occasion, however, has a major sponsor: BR's Network South East. Its friendly spokesperson encouraged me to use the sponsor's facilities and enjoy the preview on Wednesday on a direct line from Waterloo. 'Frankly,' she confided, 'we see this occasion as something of a PR Showcase.' The thousands who have already been trapped this year in BR Showcases would probably have known better. On the spokesperson's advice, I opted for the 'easy 10-minute hop' from Clapham Junction down to Waterloo. For unexplained reasons, the connecting link to the showcase ground to a halt just outside walking distance to Waterloo, sat for 35 minutes and missed the Sponsor's Special Press Show Train, scheduled for 10.34. It was hard to be entirely certain at first that the connecting link was as late as it seemed because the big clocks at Waterloo had stopped for the morning. Something, it emerged, must have forewarned them. A heart attack down the line at Malvern was reported to have delayed the Special Press Train by nearly 10 minutes, but not for long enough to sit all the Press into the Showcase. Latecomers, therefore, were advised to catch the 10.54 to Hampton Court, which turned out to be even more difficult because the only 10.54 was a Silver City Special Departure which left superbly on time, refusing to accept any fee-paying passengers. Back on Platform 4, the BR staff awaiting the ordinary gardener's 10.54 were surprised to find a 10.45 to Guildford which was not going anywhere. On questioning, they remarked that the root of the trouble was Rain On The Points (the ROP hazard). By now, several hundred garden visitors had also joined the clamour for the Showcase with a feeling that they were being ROP'ed off. Loudspeaker announcements at Waterloo are not intelligible to passengers who cannot decode echoes, but we were asured that problems with points and signals were making delays inevitable. It could happen to any of us, but it had not happened to the Special Press Train or the Silver City Special which had both left on time for exactly our destination. Remarkable aggression now seethed among my fellow Showcases, most of whom had paid a cool Pounds 18 for their show ticket and a price ranging from Pounds 3.20 for the remaining part of BR's journey. After 45 minutes the Showcase arrived, sat around and eventually crept forward. Almost everyone on it was bound for Hampton Court, as promised, but the itinerary involved stops at each intervening station. It was understandable, but not well-advised, that the first announcement to the passengers on board was a routine call to ensure we were on the right train. The second, shortly afterwards, was even less fortunate. On the left hand side, we were told, we could now see BR's engineers working hard to put right the trouble with points and signalling which had delayed anyone who was not travelling on an important freebie. At about 30 mph, coachloads of jeering gardeners enjoyed a long hard look at one BR workperson in an orange, fluorescent anorak who was scraping at the loose shingle on a nearby line. Soapwort on the sleepers, I suppose, said one of my neighbours. After 12.30, we were finally put down with two alternatives: a long walk to the show entrance, or a further long queue for a 70p boat ride to the entrance. I chose the boat ride, reflecting that those who non-journalists were paying, on Wednesday, Pounds 18 for the ticket, at least Pounds 3.20 for the train and Pounds 1.40 for the boat. I must emphasise that the special quality of Hampton Court Show is the volume of good plants, pots and extras on sale from tradesmen who are being charged next to nothing to display it and are hoping for us to buy them out. I did just feel that an arrival fee of Pounds 15-Pounds 22 is a bit steep for entry to a glorified garden trade fair. What about the Citizen's Charter as a refuge for gardeners who want to let off lost steam? We asked for forms at Hampton Court but the friendly ticketperson was not at all sure he had any. Charter Refunds seem to apply to season tickets and big block buyers, not to gardeners with a Showcase Single. At best, they may hope for a 20 per cent refund in a voucher for another journey on the same network. None of my many interviewees was willing to volunteer for the risk of such a refund and the risk of use of Charter Credit. John Nelson, managing director of Network South East, asked all members of the press to 'remember if you come by train you avoid the stresses of driving and the difficulties of trying to park the car.' How true, how very true, but as I prepared for the Showtrip home, a certain darkness of mood did descend as yet more rain fell on points and the joy went out of the last 30 minutes among lovely Princess Alstoemias and the rare plants on sale from Green Farm Nursery. Next year, I suggest that show sponsorship is handed to a privatised network of individual power boat drivers who can deliver passengers direct to Hampton Court jetty. Otherwise, I will devise my own timetable and travel the last two miles on my reliable horse. After all, it costs nothing to exhibit inside the tent. I could set up a stall selling animal manure.</p>

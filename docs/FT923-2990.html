			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Shedding light on the environment - In A Nutshell Pharos, a computerised advisory service launched earlier this year by National Westminster Bank to provide information on the single European market has been expanded to include information on environmental issues. Pharos, a program which can be used on IBM-compatible machines, builds a profile of the user's business by asking a series of questions. It then identifies issues in these two areas which may impinge on the company. The weakness of most advice booklets is that they provide answers but give no guidance on the relevant questions, according to NatWest. Pharos, believed to be the most widely used personal computer-based expert system in the world, helps users to ask the right questions. More than 150,000 businesses applied for free copies of the Pharos program when it was launched. The system is now available for Pounds 40 (plus VAT), including an update in March 1993, to NatWest customers, clients of accountants Ernst &amp; Young and CBI members, and for Pounds 125 to others. Contact NatWest on Freefone 0800 777 888 or ask at local branches.</p>

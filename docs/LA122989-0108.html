			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FALLEN O.C. SOLDIER, 19, FOUGHT 'THROUGH HELL';  </P> <P> FUNERAL: MORE THAN 200 MOURNERS LAY TO REST AN ARMY RANGER KILLED IN THE FIRST  WAVE OF THE PANAMA INVASION.  </P> <P> Hundreds of mourners, led in prayer by a minister who urged them to "criticize  the Noriegas" of the world, gathered Thursday at a military funeral for Army  Pfc. Roy Dennis Brown Jr., killed in the first wave of the invasion of Panama.  </P> <P> Brown, 19, who would have returned to his Buena Park home on leave Thursday,  was instead eulogized as an Army Ranger who fought "through hell." Later, in a  graveside ceremony that included a taps played by a bugler and seven soldiers  in full dress firing three volleys into the air, Brown was posthumously awarded  a Purple Heart.  </P> <P> "As recently as Dec. 20, your freedom and my freedom was protected by the blood  of this, our brother in Christ," the Rev. Wiley Drake, pastor of the First  Southern Baptist Church in Buena Park, told more than 200 grieving friends and  relatives who packed a chapel in Anaheim.  </P> <P> Drake, speaking from a podium surrounded by floral arrangements a few feet from  Brown's flag-draped coffin, urged the mourners not to criticize the invasion of  Panama, but the reasons why President Bush -- whom he described as "Roy's  commander-in-chief" -- sent U.S. forces there.  </P> <P> "If we are quick to criticize, if we're quick to ask why, let us criticize the  Noriegas, let us criticize the drug lords as Roy did and would, let us  criticize those that would end our freedoms, and let us criticize those that  would poison our young people," Drake said.  </P> <P> Brown was among nearly a dozen U.S. soldiers buried this week in towns  scattered from Pawtucket R.I., to Greenville S.C. Two other soldiers were also  buried Thursday.  </P> <P> In the Pennsylvania hamlet of Hallstead, hundreds of townspeople paused in  their daily toils Thursday to say goodby to a fallen son, Sgt. Larry Barnard,  29, a father of three who was killed in the second day of the U.S. invasion.  </P> <P> And in Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Va., a Peruvian family  gathered for the funeral of Alejandro I. Manriquelozano, 30, who immigrated to  Lauderhill, Fla., five years ago and had hopes of becoming a U.S. citizen.  </P> <P> In all, 23 military personnel died in Panama, officials said.  </P> <P> Brown was among the first troops assigned to attack in the Panama invasion,  said Maj. Gen. Todd Graham, deputy commander of the 6th Army based at the  Presidio in San Francisco. He said Brown was killed during an early-morning  assault on Dec. 20 at Rio Hato, the site of a Panamanian Defense Force camp.  </P> <P> Graham, who attended Brown's funeral, said 3,000 troops parachuted into the  camp, a target that he said was essential to the success of the invasion.  </P> <P> Brown's funeral began promptly at 11 a.m. with an emotional rendition of  "America the Beautiful," followed by a reading of the 23rd Psalm by his  maternal aunt and uncle, Mimi and Bill Campbell of Darby, Mont. Mimi Campbell  later eulogized Brown as a full-of-life youngster who occasionally liked to  play practical jokes. She later became more serious, especially about his  military service.  </P> <P> "Roy was really a special baby -- he was quick to come into the world,"  Campbell said. "It was a short 8 1/2-minute delivery, as if he was in a hurry  to do what he had to do. More than 70 years he packed into 19 years of life.  </P> <P> "I look at Roy's life like an unfrosted cake," she said later in her eulogy.  "It didn't need the icing because it was wholesome and good just as it was."  </P> <P> Campbell smiled and drew occasional chuckles with tales of Brown's  mischievousness, but she choked up when she concluded her eulogy with a reading  of a poem from the Army Ranger's handbook. In part, the poem read: "They blaze  the trail to victory, where next no one can tell, but should they ever be  called upon, they'll fight their way through hell."  </P> <P> "Roy did that," Campbell said.  </P> <P> Brown was also eulogized by John Halsey, director of the marching band at  Anaheim's Magnolia High School, where Brown played the trombone. Halsey  recalled Brown as "a gangly kid (who) really wanted to become involved in the  music program" and later came to look on Halsey as "more or less like an uncle  or older brother."  </P> <P> "He had an impish smile, sort of a -- not a Dennis the Menace smile -- sort of  like Opie, (from the old 'Andy Griffith Show')," Halsey said, drawing smiles  and mild laughter from friends and family. "He had a lot of funny antics, but I  can't share them all here now because some of his teachers may be here."  </P> <P> The coffin was shut for the services, but it was open for a public viewing  Wednesday. Brown was clad in his full-dress Army Ranger uniform, with his  prized black beret tucked neatly beneath his left arm.  </P> <P> After the funeral service Thursday, the family was allowed a few final private  moments with Brown. His casket was carried out of the funeral home by six  soldiers from the Ft. Ord funeral detachment. After the coffin was placed in  the hearse, Brown's mother, Julie Otto, emerged from the chapel, clad in black,  and carrying a single red rose.  </P> <P> A contingent of motorcycle police then led the mourners on a 20-mile trip to  Brown's grave site on a gently sloped hillside at the Holy Sepulcher Cemetery  in East Orange.  </P> <P> The short ceremony started with a reading of the "Infantrymen's Prayer," part  of which read: "Give us courage, O Lord, in the face of danger."  </P> <P> The prayer was followed by the gun salute, carried out by an honor guard that  patiently stood at parade rest as the large contingent of mourners slowly filed  up to the grave site. Many mourners dabbed at their eyes and others burst into  tears as a lone bugler played taps.  </P> <P> Sgt. John Arvan, a member of Brown's Ranger battalion who was assigned to  escort the family, said conversations in the time he spent with them revealed  that the family understood the importance of the mission.  </P> <P> "They knew what he was doing," Jones said. "They didn't have . . . malice. . .  . They knew it was his job."  </P> <P> In Hallstead, Pa., Thursday, Panama seemed light years away from the community  tragedy unfolding in the rolling dairy land along the Susquehanna River, the  home of Sgt. Barnard.  </P> <P> "If Larry ever brought anyone home, it was always someone who was hurting,"  said the Rev. Keith Benjamin in his sermon. "Whether he was volunteering to mow  lawns for older neighbors or offering some other help, he was the kind of guy  who could not pass a person on the street if he saw that they were suffering."  </P> <P> Farther south, Manriquelozano was the first Panama casualty to be buried at  Arlington National Cemetery.  </P> <P> Manriquelozano was a young man whose Peruvian family saw him as both  breadwinner and hope for the future.  </P> <P> "He was the kind of guy who, if you had no shirt, he would give you his," said  his cousin, Jose Canalas of Long Island, N.Y., a hotel manager.  </P> <P> Under a bright winter sky, Alejandro's father, mother and other family members  looked on sadly. The family was given two American flags and two Purple Hearts  by Army officials.  </P> <P> At the age of 25, the Peruvian immigrated to Florida, where he took a variety  of jobs, including one as a kind of houseboy in Miami to Julio Iglesias, the  popular singer. Iglesias sent flowers to Manriquelozano's funeral.  </P> <P> He was a young man with an infectious smile, who had decided early that his  dream of economic security and a better life for himself and his family lay to  the north in the United States. He hoped to one day become a U.S. citizen.  </P> <P> Larry Barnard had no such travails.  </P> <P> The far reaches of northern Pennsylvania was countryside that Barnard loved  deeply, his minister said, a place where as a teen-ager he would ride his horse  over the ridge and into the forest to chop wood for his grandparents.  </P> <P> Barnard, who married his high school sweetheart, Tammy, and had three children,  never dreamed of anything but the Army -- "100% Army," as one friend described  him a few days after his death. He volunteered for service right out of high  school and eventually became a Ranger, a high-profile job that took him to the  invasion of Grenada.  </P> <P> Pennsylvania Gov. Robert P. Casey had visited with the Barnard family  Wednesday, and President Bush sent a major general bearing condolences. But the  real message was the 400 people -- seemingly the entire town -- who gathered in  the freshly fallen snow at the United Methodist Church in Hallstead for the  funeral of their friend, brother and son. When the chapel overflowed, 100 more  crowded into a basement.  </P> <P> "Thank you all so much for coming," were the only words Barnard's older  brother, Ray, could manage. His father, Ray Sr., simply broke into tears,  clutching the folded U.S. flag presented by the military.  </P> <P> "His parents were always apprehensive (of his military work), but they were  very aware and very proud of the fact that (the Army) was of his choosing,"  said longtime family friend Trudy Zurn.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Jill Stewart contributed to this story  </P></p>

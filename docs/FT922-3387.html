			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Arts: Dark Elegies - Ballet The Ballet du Rhin broke the run of its charming Fille mal gardee on Tuesday and Wednesday with a triple bill of more modern works. I wish the programme had allowed us a more flattering view of the troupe, but after showing that the company could deal well with a masterpiece (Dark Elegies), we were faced with a gadarene rush into fatuity and unflattering choreography in stagings by Claude Brumachon and Oscar Araiz. Antony Tudor made Dark Elegies in 1937, and it was a prophetic work. Mahler's Kindertotenlieder were to become terribly apt in the war years, and to our shame, they are still more pertinent today. Tudor's language turns a community's agonies into ritual that never dulls the pain of parental loss, and the Ballet du Rhin interpretation has the austerity, the avoidance of overt sentiment, that Tudor demanded in performance of his work. I think that Dark Elegies would strike most terribly home were its soloists to be great dancers who sternly repressed their feelings but we cannot hope for such casting, and the present artists' simplicity, their sense of responsibility to the text, is pleasingly honest. If the text itself differs from the old Ballet Rambert version we knew for many years, it yet remains the most powerful expression of grief that dance has yet given us, and the Ballet du Rhin do not betray it. Just what Claude Brumachon's Hawk's Lament' expresses I could not fathom. Three women in long dresses leaned backwards and postured. Four men, in revealingly tattered garb, entwined themselves. An attractive score by Christopher Zurfluh made mediaeval noises. The stage was not over-lit. There were frenetic slappings and brief, anxious gestures. Nothing else happened - neither well-organised dance nor discernibly rational activity. The curtain fell. Swift ingestion of alcohol is the only cure. Not even alcohol, though, could numb the awfulness of Oscar Araiz' version of The Carnival of the Animals. How it is possible to stage Saint-Saens' witty, charming, infinitely felicitous score without a single atom of its many virtues rubbing off on to the dance, I do not know, but Mr Araiz has succeeded. He is aided and abetted by a witless barrage of rhymed couplets that introduce each animal, spoken on Tuesday with great good humour by Adrian Edmondson, who deserved danger-money for having to memorise so much bad verse. Mr Edmondson was also the most entertaining mover on stage, the choreography for the large cast condemning them to actions foolish, inordinately dull. The Ballet du Rhin continues at Sadler's Wells with its version of La Fille mal gardee until June 13. The visit is made possible by the Association Francaise d'Action Artistique and the Opera du Rhin.</p>

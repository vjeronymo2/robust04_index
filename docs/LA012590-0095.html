			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: HOLLYWOOD;  </P> <P> PLAN TO CLEAN WALK OF FAME  </P> <P> The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce hopes a new program with the Los Angeles  Conservation Corps will help remove the "5 o'clock shadow" of trash, dirt and  graffiti on Hollywood Boulevard's Walk of Fame.  </P> <P> "There is a contractor paid by the city to clean these sidewalks in the early  morning, but Hollywood Boulevard has such heavy foot traffic, by 5 p.m. it is  dirty again," said chamber President Larry Kaplan.  </P> <P> Under the one-year pilot program, set to begin Feb. 3, local children and a  supervising team of Conservation Corps adults will clean up the street after  school. Besides picking up trash, volunteers will clean grafitti and start a  recycling program.  </P> <P> The Chamber of Commerce has donated $50,000 to the $135,000 program, with the  rest coming from the corps.  </P> <P> An inaugural demonstration for the program by Conservation Corps members will  be held at 1:30 p.m. Friday at 6689 Hollywood Blvd.  </P></p>

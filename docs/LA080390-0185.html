			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MURPHY WON'T VETO PHILS TRADE; DEAL STILL ON HOLD  </P> <P> Dale Murphy has agreed not to veto a trade that would send him to the Phillies,  his agent said, but the deal apparently is on hold over the Braves' demand for  a second player in the package.  </P> <P> Team officials have said the trade centered around sending Murphy to  Philadelphia for relief pitcher Jeff Parrett.  </P> <P> But the Atlanta Constitution said in today's editions that the Phillies have  balked at the Braves' demand for another, unidentified player in the package.  </P> <P> Braves General Manager Bobby Cox refused to comment.  </P> <P> As a 10-year veteran Murphy had the right to veto a trade, but he will not do  so, his agent, Bruce Church, said Thursday.  </P> <P> "Where it goes past here is up to Bobby," Church said. "I guess you could say  we're waiting on him."  </P> <P> If the Braves grant permission, the Phillies could begin contract talks with  Murphy, whose pact expires at the end of this season.  </P></p>

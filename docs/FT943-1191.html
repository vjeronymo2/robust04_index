			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (23): User-friendly system for care workers - Case study One organisation which has been installing a mission-critical client-server system for its superior user-friendliness is Hampshire County Council's Social Services Department. It faced a statutory obligation to mount a new programme of care for people in need and the council was required to identify all those who should be covered by the scheme, assess their individual needs, prioritise those needs and devise plans for services. It decided to design a client-server system to ensure that all those involved in providing care would be users of the system. Its mainframes were mainly used by administrators but not by the professional social workers themselves. The new system was based on client-server principles so that it would be much easier for social workers to use. The council's servers are IBM and Amdahl mainframes at the Winchester and Andover head offices, with IBM and Dellpersonal computers acting as local database servers at 19 area offices. The client machines are local area networks of PCs, which may be installed at some 200 other sites around the county. The mainframes run a single centralised Oracle database, from which data is downloaded to the area servers running Gupta's SQLBase database. The Oracle database is updated each night in batch mode. Applications software was written by the Easams consultancy. The system started to go live in April and by next spring will be supporting 460 users. Dr Angela Oakley, the council's senior consultant who was responsible for setting it up, says the early indications are that it is helping to improve the efficiency of the service. 'Many social workers have a fear of computers, but within an hour or two of using this system they are saying that they really like it,' she says. 'They will now spend much less of their time on bureaucracy and more on the caring part of their work.' She says that client-server is 'not a cheap, but a cost-effective solution.' At worst, the new system will prove no more expensive than the centralised alternative and it is far more powerful and flexible, she says. She believes there is no other client-server system available for the same application. Several other local authorities have expressed an interest in buying the software from Hampshire. Dr Oakley says the viability of client-server solutions depends very much on the type of application involved. 'Client-server is not a panacea for all circumstances. There are all sorts of pitfalls. You need to understand whether the application lends itself to this approach. If you need to support several hundred concurrent users on one local database it probably won't work.' The other most important factor, she says, is the range of skills available to the system's developer. Mr Spikes confirms this and notes: 'the shortage of skills is one of the main things which is holding people back now.'</p>

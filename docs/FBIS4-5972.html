			<p>BFN     [Text] The present low-key economic cooperation between  Malaysia and Laos is preventing the expansion of trade by the  two countries. The lack of communications and the insight of  trade opportunities in both countries is also another factor  affecting the trade expansion. This was stated by Datuk Sri Dr.  Mahathir Mohamed when addressing a seminar attended by  businessmen of the two countries in Vientiane, Laos. The  two-way trade amounted to only U.S. $18 million although several  Malaysians had invested in many projects in the country such as  road building and hotel renovation. The prime minister expressed  confidence that cooperation in various fields could be  increased. The prime minister arrived in the Laotian capital  today on a second leg of a visit to Cambodia and Laos. Datuk  Sri Dr. Mahathir is expected to sign a bilateral payment  arrangement pact to boost commercial ties with Laos.</p>

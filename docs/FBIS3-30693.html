The head of the government told journalists of  this upon his return to Warsaw's Okecie airport.    Referring to the inauguration of the Association Treaty with  the European Communities, the prime minister said that real  association will be decided not by declaration but by  cooperation, especially economic. On that side, there is the  will to seek practical solutions that will allow for the  overcoming of negative tendencies in trade exchange, Pawlak  assured.    Journalists questioned the prime minister, above all, about  the case of Deputy Prime Minister Marek Borowski. Pawlak stated  that he will meet on Thursday [3 February] with Democratic Left  Alliance leader Aleksander Kwasniewski and a number of other  people. He announced that in the course of the meeting he will  see if press rumors about Borowski's planned resignation are  certain.    He reported that he had spoken with the deputy prime  minister  so often that he did not see any cause for misunderstanding.  "If I had problems with cooperation with Mr. Borowski, then the  explanation would surely be between myself and Mr. Borowski," he  stated, adding that the dismissed Deputy Minister of Finance  Stefan Kawalec "would certainly not take part in this."</p>

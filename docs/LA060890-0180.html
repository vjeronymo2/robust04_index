			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FILMMAKER MOORE'S NBA SEGMENT SHOT DOWN  </P> <P> CBS Sports had this great idea for a halftime feature on Thursday night's  second game of the Portland-Detroit NBA Finals.  </P> <P> They were going to air a humorous segment featuring Michael Moore, creator of  the documentary "Roger &amp; Me," and some unemployed Detroit auto workers  trying to get front-row tickets for the playoff game with the help of Piston  players -- a spoof of the usual features that show big-name stars cheering on  their favorites.  </P> <P> Moore's "Roger &amp; Me," which has won several awards, detailed the losses of  jobs in the auto industry in Flint, Mich., and Moore's futile attempts to  interview GM Chairman Roger Smith.  </P> <P> GM has charged Moore with a variety of inaccuracies in the film.  </P> <P> Moore said Thursday that he and halftime CBS Sports segment producer Eric Mann  had been discussing the "lighthearted" piece for several days and that he was  set to fly to Detroit on Tuesday to do the film during Game 1. But on Monday,  "I got word that it was canceled."  </P> <P> "GM is still smarting from the success of the film," Moore said. "But the guys  at CBS were very nice to me. I think they feel very bad about this."  </P> <P> John Mueller, a spokesman for GM in Detroit, said the Thursday night game "was  never discussed with General Motors. Programming decisions are the  responsibility of the network."  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXCESS BAGGAGE SCAM  </P> <P> Regarding the excess baggage article by Peter Greenberg (Savvy Traveler, Jan.  28): I was almost a victim of the overseas airline scam recently. When I flew  from Los Angeles to New York and on to Morocco via Iberian Airlines, for my  excess baggage of 70 pounds I paid $76.  </P> <P> On my return trip, I learned from Iberia that an overnight in Madrid would be  necessary, so I elected to transfer to Royal Air Maroc. By pure chance I asked  the Air Maroc agent what the charge would be for the extra 70 pounds. I was  told that it would be about $500 -- what I paid one way from Morocco to Los  Angeles. Fortunately, I had two weeks before my departure to get over the shock  and have the articles sent back by parcel post for $185.  </P> <P> I believe it should be standard practice for travel agents as well as American  airline companies to warn their customers of this nefarious practice.  </P> <P> DORIS LENART  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Parties clash over ERM and inflation - Economy CONSERVATIVE charges that a Labour election victory would cast doubt on sterling's position in the European exchange rate mechanism and lead to higher inflation were angrily disputed in the Commons last night. The row overshadowed predictions by Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, that if the Conservatives secured a further period of office, any tax cuts made in the budget on March 10 would be quickly cancelled out. Mr David Mellor, chief secretary to the Treasury, warned that with a Labour government in office Britain's annual rate of inflation would double from the current 4.1 per cent. He also contended that interest rates would be higher than would be necessary under a Conservative government. Mr Nick Brown, a Labour treasury spokesman, insisted that a Labour government would play its 'full part' in the exchange rate mechanism. To Labour cheers, he said: 'It is not necessary to spell out precisely which mechanism, at which point of time, a Labour chancellor would need to use in order to preserve our position'. Earlier Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's shadow chief secretary, was fiercely criticised by Conservative MPs for her response to repeated challenges to confirm that, if necessary, a Labour government would raise interest rates to defend sterling's position in the ERM. She stated: 'We have long expressed the view that if the exchange rate is properly managed there is no need to raise interest rates'. This was dubbed a 'most extraordinary cop-out' by Mr Mellor. Mr Alan Beith, Treasury spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, urged Mrs Beckett to explain how a Labour government would tackle rising inflation when the British economy began to recover from recession. Mrs Beckett told him: 'You should know better than to cast doubt on the willingness of a prospective government to maintain the exchange rate'. A Labour attempt to condemn ministers for the the business failures, and soaring unemployment arising from the measures needed to reduce inflation from the high level caused by the government was defeated by 136 votes (324-188). At a Westminster press conference, Mr Smith likened Conservative claims that the objective of a balanced budget was not inconsistent with increased borrowing to finance tax cuts to a 'three card trick'.</p>

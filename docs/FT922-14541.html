			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Christian Democrat dominance at risk: President Cossiga leads the way to the polls as Italians put ruling coalition to the test THROUGHOUT Italy yesterday voters turned up in large numbers to vote in what was widely seen as the country's most important general election since 1948. The interior ministry said last night that at the close of polling yesterday  -the booths reopen today until 2pm - 67 per cent of the 47.4m electorate had voted. Although this was just under 2 per cent below the figure at the corresponding time in the 1987 general election, the difference was blamed on bad weather. The election campaign, for the 630 seats in the chamber of deputies and the 315 seats in the senate, saw the ruling Christian Democrats on the defensive with their poor record of recent economic management and failure to carry out institutional reforms. Against a background of widespread disaffection and a strong protest vote, for the first time in the post-war era the party's hegemony over Italian politics looked at risk. Commentators and polls, albeit unreliable, predicted that the Christian Democrat-led four-party coalition would lose votes in the north to the populist Lombard League and the small centre-left Republican party (PRI), and appeared hard pressed to retain its share of the vote in the centre and south. The Christian Democrats and their Socialist, Social Democrat (PSDI) and Liberal (PLI) allies held 53 per cent of the vote in the outgoing parliament. If their total vote falls below 49 per cent it will be impossible to form a new government without turning to one of the nine groups that became a loosely defined opposition during the election campaign. The Christian Democrats held 34 per cent of the vote in the 1987 elections and, if the percentage goes below 30 per cent, this would be a big psychological blow. Yesterday was the first time Italians had voted without a communist party. Ms Nilde Iotti, a prominent former communist and president of the senate, said yesterday: 'Today's vote is the most important for Italy since 1948.' The authorities reported few serious incidents during polling. However, voting was overshadowed by the brutal Mafia murder of a senior Carabiniere officer near Agrigento, Sicily, on Saturday. The officer had been prominent in a number of investigations into organised crime and his killing appeared deliberately timed to remind the authorities of the Mafia's power. Links between the Mafia and Christian Democrat and Socialist politicians emerged as a big issue during the elections. The Socialists, who were fighting to retain their 14.3 per cent of the vote, were also deeply embarrassed by a corruption scandal in Milan involving Mr Mario Chiesa, a prominent party supporter. The scandal was expected to dent the Socialist vote throughout the north. The ruling parties' main challenge yesterday looked likely to be from the Lombard League and the Republicans. Mr Umberto Bossi, the league leader, wound up his campaign on Friday night with a rally in front of Milan cathedral, reminding his audience that change in Italy had always come from the north. The league would be doing well country-wide if it picked up 8 per cent of the vote.</p>

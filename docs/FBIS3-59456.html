			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Dr. Irfan Ljubijankic by </F> Sejad Luckin; place and date not given: "Bosnia Has Friends"]    [Text] Dr. Irfan Ljubijankic has been head of the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina for some three months. In diplomatic terms,  this is certainly a short period for making any radical changes,  and he has had additional difficulties: the communications  isolation of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the war conditions that  result in additional factors in the way our country appears  abroad. On the other hand, the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina are  still hoping that the international community could, by putting  more pressure on the aggressor, speed up the solution to the  crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is only an additional burden  for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Minister Ljubijankic  personally.    [Luckin] Minister Ljubijankic, you have recently presented  an  initiative to the NATO secretary general for Bosnia-Herzegovina  to be accepted into the military alliance Partnership for Peace.  What was the reason for this, and does it announce a new course  in the foreign policy of Bosnia-Herzegovina?  <H5>  We Are a European Country </H5>   [Ljubijankic] No. This is only the natural course of our  becoming a European country. On 23 December last year we  submitted a kind of application, a letter that I addressed to  Manfred Woerner, in which I presented our intentions and our  willingness to meet all the requirements to become a member of  Partnership for Peace. As you know, Partnership for Peace is an  initiative -- the response of the United States to the request  of Eastern European countries for admission to NATO. The United  States could not accept the full membership of the Eastern  European countries in NATO, probably in diplomatic and political  consideration of Russia, but it set the framework within which  cooperation with NATO is possible. Such is Partnership for  Peace. Within this group the countries would have to coordinate  their military programs, their military industries programs,  their strategic goals, and their military maneuvers, in other  words, all the elements of military strategy and their military  and political organization.    [Luckin] Where do you see the positions of  Bosnia-Herzegovina in this alliance?    [Ljubijankic] We consider ourselves part of Europe. We are  a country that has had the same experience with totalitarian  communism as the countries of Eastern Europe. We can thus enter  this NATO project on an equal basis, on the grounds of our  cultural, geographical, and political characteristics, and our  efforts to create a democratic country. Therefore, Europe is  our framework, as is democracy; cooperation with the Western  military Alliance is our choice.    [Luckin] On the other hand, however, our republic is often  reproached in international circles for providing a place for  Islam to break through into Europe. What is your interpretation  of this and of the criticism that we are too oriented toward the  Arabic countries in our foreign policy?    [Ljubijankic] I would not say that we are criticized for  this in Europe; these are our own dilemmas. We are a European  country and we can be nothing else. Our peculiarity is that we  are a European country with a centuries-old Islamic tradition.  This is perhaps a new quality, and an interesting symbiosis  that the world perhaps fears a little. We must explain to the  world what this is and dispel the fear and prejudice. I see no  reason for religion, as a private matter for the individual, to  be a cause of fear in a secular state.  <H5>  The Process of Forming the State </H5>   [Luckin] The war conditions and the communications blockade  are, no doubt, additional problems for the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs. How do you see the present activities, as well as the  process of constituting this ministry?    [Ljubijankic] You see, we are in the process of forming a  state. The people who came to power at the democratic  elections, who readily took over the responsibility too, are  mostly people with not too much experience in the state and  legal organization of the Muslim Bosniak people and Bosnia as a  state. When I say Muslim Bosniak people I do not exclude them  from Bosnia; they are an integral part of the multicultural  Bosnia, just as the other components are.    The activities of our ministry at a time of war are subject  to our efforts to organize a better state. Naturally, this is  much more difficult in war conditions, but we have succeeded to  a great extent. The ministry plays a role in establishing the  country abroad, in which we have also succeeded to a great  extent, although we are faced with a blockade that has its  sociological and political causes, which I would not like to go  into now. However, it is a fact that we have friends in the  world, and it is a fact that many organizations, individuals,  and eminent intellectuals support the existence of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. That official policies do not always follow  public opinion results from the fact that official policies  always follow highly pragmatic interests, the geostrategic  interests of a country or the group of countries to which it  belongs.    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, naturally, has another  task,  which is to develop a diplomatic-consular network that did not  previously exist. This is a major and serious project, and we  sometimes lack experience in carrying it out, but we certainly  have a resolute intention to complete it and incorporate it into  the state system.    [Luckin] There has been much talk about the selection of  ambassadors. Could you clarify the criteria for their  selection, and what do you say to the stories about this being a  way to put certain prominent people in safe places, far from the  war in Bosnia-Herzegovina?   <H5>    Strategic Goal -- An Integral Bosnia-Herzegovina </H5>   [Ljubijankic] I would not say this is correct. The criteria  are similar to those in other countries: an established  political profile, an established political attitude and  structure that corresponds to the positions of our country, as  well as all the general criteria, such as language, education,  and even physical appearance.    [Luckin] What direction will the future efforts of  Bosnia-Herzegovina's diplomacy take in presenting and supporting  the interests of our country abroad, and have there been any  changes in the international view of the crisis in  Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Ljubijankic] We all have a unitary Bosnia-Herzegovina in  our hearts. If you listened to President Izetbegovic's speech  at the constitutent session of the SDA [Party of Democratic  Action] City Council of Sarajevo, you will have heard his vision  of the tactics for achieving that goal. I have nothing to add  or take away from that statement. Therefore, an integral  Bosnia-Herzegovina is our strategic goal, but the circumstances  on the ground will not permit a rapid realization of it.  Naturally, this kind of Bosnia- Herzegovina is our right, and,  in my opinion, we should neither cede it nor give it to someone  else.    An integral Bosnia-Herzegovina in these areas is an  achievement of centuries of history, so to speak. We were  destined to be the ones to create Bosnia-Herzegovina as an  integral state, and we should not drop it in such a short time.  I think that there have been certain changes in the attitude of  the international community toward an integral  Bosnia-Herzegovina, but they are still ineffective. There have  been changes, but they have not yielded any results yet. These  changes should have more impact; they should be more effective  and more efficient, and really change the position of  Bosnia-Herzegovina in the negotiating process. Europe still  believes that the solution that it has offered would be a modus  vivendi, that it would be a way to bring peace to  Bosnia-Herzegovina. We would, naturally, not like it to be  peace at any price.    [Luckin] There are opinions that a more aggressive foreign  policy toward the countries of Western Europe, especially  Britain and France, could significantly change the position of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Ljubijankic] People sometimes think that diplomacy is  something that just requires additional engagement, an  additional effort, to make things change for the better.  Diplomacy is a series of small steps, and there are no  spectacular results, not even in the case of great countries,  let alone with a small country that has suffered a lot and that  has been developing its diplomacy through a war. Therefore, we  could not expect any great gain or great change if we were to  redirect our diplomatic activities toward England and France.  Indeed, we have done so.  <H5>  There Is Always Someone Obstructing </H5>   I have spent seven days in London, and there have been some  positive results since this visit. There have also been several  letters. We have made certain commitments -- naturally, within  the diplomatic framework. England has indirectly made a  commitment to work on a better understanding of our position of  a country at war. We have suspended all our activities  concerning pressing charges against England at the International  Court. As far as France is concerned, there have been some  positive changes, but, you see, there is always another France  or another England. When these countries are prepared to make a  concession, a change in the position in the collective bodies of  the international community that are relevant in making  decisions, there is always someone to obstruct that. I therefore  think that it is not only a matter of France and England, but a  larger number of countries that simply will not allow  Bosnia-Herzegovina enough room to maneuver for it to survive.  Luckily, we do have friends. The United States is one of them.  However, the United States is strongly tied to France and  England in implementing its strategic interests and the  strategic interests of all NATO.</p>

			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Interest costs hit Monument Higher interest payments and a provision for Australian taxes reduced net interim profits from Pounds 3.65m to Pounds 1.89m at Monument Oil and Gas. Sales of the independent UK oil and gas exploration company in the first half of 1992 rose 28 per cent from Pounds 16.3m to Pounds 20.8m; and the contribution from the Harriet oil field in Australia helped lift operating profit by 38 per cent to Pounds 2.3m (Pounds 1.67m). Interest paid was Pounds 198,000, against Pounds 1.97m received last time. Overseas tax came to Pounds 209,000 (Pounds 3,000). Under its strategy of disposing of oil and gas properties which are no longer making a significant contribution, Monument is disposing of its interest in the Buchan field to Brabant Petroleum, subject to government approval. The consideration is Pounds 2.52m cash.</p>

			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOV. DEUKMEJIAN ON STATE BUDGET AND TIMES RESPONSE  </P> <P> I enjoyed Deukmejian's letter. However, I did feel his suggestion was  inappropriate that Times Mirror Co. donate part of its $332 million profit to  the state. A corporation is a neutral entity (even those protected by the First  Amendment). Personally, I think the donations should come from the editorial  staff only. A nominal amount of, say, 1/10 of 1% of your gross would be about  right.  </P> <P> Since I don't ask people to do what I won't do, I have enclosed my check to go  along with all your voluntary contributions. You see, I prefer to donate  voluntarily -- say to the L.A. Times Summer Camp Fund -- rather than in a  compulsory way via taxes.  </P> <P> TERRENCE THOMPSON  </P> <P> Whittier  </P></p>

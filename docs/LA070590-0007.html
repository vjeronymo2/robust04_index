			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE HOME COOK;  </P> <P> ICEBERG LETTUCE: CRISPY FRIEND TO MANY FOODS  </P> <P> If it could, iceberg lettuce would smile. Round and crisp, it is a perfect  creation. Although its flavor is delicate, it is a sturdy creature, unlike some  of the frail field lettuce that wilt, swoon and get the vapors. My dog Rover  loves it, especially dunked in meat drippings; he wouldn't touch arugula with a  10-foot pole.  </P> <P> Iceberg lettuce is a close friend of every sandwich of note -- hamburger,  peanut butter, cheese, club, tuna, deviled egg -- and there are no substitutes  for the crunchy, pale-green leaves. Like Mark Twain, iceberg has some important  continental connections, to Mandarin China (Minced Squab in Lettuce Leaves) and  to France (the classic Petits Pois a la Francaise). Iceberg is equally at home  on the table of an aristocrat or a peasant. Adaptable, always available, no  better food friend exists.  </P> <P> The following recipes are diverse and easily made at home. If squab isn't one  of your basic kitchen ingredients, Minced Squab in Lettuce Leaves is equally  good when made with chopped chicken. Petits Pois a la Francaise (freshly  shelled peas cooked with iceberg lettuce and butter) lifts the garden pea to  new heights. And the Iceberg Wedge, with thick creamy dressing, is still as  great as a Caesar salad, when made properly.  </P> <P> It is important to follow one step in preparing iceberg lettuce prior to use.  Remove the core. Fill a large bowl or soup pot with cold water. Forcefully  plunge the lettuce, cored end down, into the water. Now shake it free of excess  water and wrap the head in several layers of toweling. (I use two layers of  paper towels and cover them with a dish towel.) Refrigerate for at least six  hours or overnight.  </P> <P> The California Iceberg Lettuce Commission informs me that Crisp-head is the  proper name for our iceberg lettuce. Last year, they say, 100 million cartons  of lettuce were sold in this country (there are approximately 24 heads to a  carton). They add that 15 billion salads were eaten, which is not surprising  considering that most people now get their vegetables through salads, and salad  consumption has increased in California. And I would personally like to  announce that my Head-Lettuce Club now has 17 members.  </P> <P> MINCED 'SQUAB' IN LETTUCE LEAVES  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons oil  </P> <P> 1 1/3 cups finely chopped skinned chicken breast  </P> <P> 3/4 cup finely chopped green pepper  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon sugar  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> Pepper  </P> <P> 2 1/2 tablespoons minced ginger root  </P> <P> 1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons water  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon lemon juice  </P> <P> 8 whole lettuce leaves, trimmed and chilled  </P> <P> 1/2 cup walnuts, finely chopped  </P> <P> Sauce  </P> <P> Heat oil in medium skillet.

Remove from  heat and place in serving bowl.  </P> <P> Assemble by placing 3 or 4 tablespoons filling on lettuce leaf, sprinkle with  walnuts and spoon Sauce over. Roll up leaf. Serve hot or cold.

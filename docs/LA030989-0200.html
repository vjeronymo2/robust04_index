			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WARNER SHAREHOLDERS FILE SUIT TO BLOCK MERGER WITH TIME  </P> <P> A group of Warner Communications Inc. stockholders charged in a lawsuit filed  Wednesday in a Delaware court that a proposed merger with Time Inc. is an  illegal scheme to block any outside takeover of Warner.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Warner and Time shares skidded as takeover talk dimmed.  </P> <P> West German publisher Bertelsmann AG said it was not interested in seeking  either Time or Warner, and industry analysts saw no other serious threats. In  New York Stock Exchange trading, Time fell $1.875 to $114.875 and Warner  declined $1.125 to $47.75 after rising in previous sessions on talk of outside  offers emerging.  </P> <P> The Warner shareholder suit, filed in Delaware's chancery court, seeks to block  the companies from proceeding with a so-called lockup provision in which Time  will exchange 12.5% of its stock for 12% of Warner's shares.  </P> <P> The provision was part of the agreement under which Time and Warner plan to  swap shares and merge into what would be the world's largest media and  entertainment company, with a market value of $18 billion.  </P> <P> Court records also showed that two more shareholder suits have been filed  challenging the merger, including one naming Time and Warner and another naming  just Warner. No other details were available immediately. The suits could later  be consolidated.  </P> <P> Time and Warner agreed to vote each other's shares in support of the merger or  in case of a proxy fight for control of Warner. This, together with Warner  director share holdings, would effectively block any outside takeover of  Warner, the shareholders said.  </P> <P> The suit charged that by blocking an outside takeover, Warner is preventing its  stockholders from receiving a fair price for their shares. It noted that Time  and Warner have each been a rumored takeover target in recent years and that it  "is generally believed that (their) merger would make them a difficult takeover  target."  </P> <P> "The merger and lockup transactions are nothing more than a plan and scheme by  the (Warner) director defendants to entrench themselves," argued the  shareholders, Bernice Berger, Harold Sachs, Joseph Kovacs and Kathleen Pessin.  </P> <P> The shareholders said in a 12-page court document that Time and Warner are  "engaged in a conspiracy and are substantially and knowingly aiding and  abetting each other in carrying out this unlawful scheme."  </P> <P> Analysts had been predicting lawsuits because some shareholders were  disappointed that a more lucrative offer did not emerge for either of the  companies, whose underlying asset values are estimated at as much as twice  their current stock market value.  </P> <P> In a related development, the House Judiciary Committee announced that its  subcommittee on economic and commercial law will hold a hearing on the proposed  merger on Tuesday.  </P></p>

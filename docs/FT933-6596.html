			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchanges: DM weaker on inflation news THE D-Mark weakened against most European currencies and the US dollar yesterday after data from several German states suggested that the country's August inflation figure would be flat, writes James Blitz. Coming the day before the Bundesbank council meeting, the better than expected inflation data were bound to depress the D-Mark. Expectations were already high for a  1/4 percentage point cut in the discount rate, currently at 6.75 per cent. Yesterday, some analysts were talking of 1/2 percentage point reduction, with inflation looking as though it would fall on an annualised basis in August from 4.3 per cent to 4.1 per cent. The major winners from the inflation news were the French franc and Danish krone, with a dealer at one of the leading London counterparties saying he had seen very strong selling of the 'Mark/Paris' cross rate. The French currency finished at FFr3.472 per D-Mark, after a previous close of FFr3.481. The krone ended at around DKr4.085, having been at DKr4.11 at the start of the day. The dollar gained nearly a pfennig against the D-Mark in the wake of the German inflation news, closing at DM1.6880. This was in spite of a sharper than expected fall in July's US durable goods orders by 3.8 per cent, the fourth monthly decline in the past five months. In New York the dollar eased back to end at DM1.6840. The pound fell back 1 1/2 pfennigs against the D-Mark, amid signs that investors were selling UK government bonds. The currency closed at DM2.5025. Rumours that the Danish authorities were selling sterling to buy Danish krone also helped to depress the British currency. The most surprising move among European currencies yesterday was in the Belgian franc, which dropped sharply against the D-Mark, from BFr21.02 to around BFr21.16. It later closed at BFr21.12. The main trigger for the move was a report that 14 Flemish economists had said that continuing to tie the Belgian franc to the D-Mark would damage industry and employment prospects and was no longer an acceptable option. The Belgian central bank leapt to the currency's defence, saying that policy would be unchanged. But Mr Mark Austin, treasury economist at Midland Global Markets, said it was striking that the Belgian currency had suffered so badly on a day when most of Europe had performed well against the D-Mark. The yen continued to weaken against the dollar, a process helped by extremely heavy intervention from the Bank of Japan at the Y104.00 level. Some dealers said they had not been expecting intervention until the currency got to Y103.00. In London, the dollar closed at Y104.9 from a previous Y103.7. It finished at Y105.0 in New York. There was a growing feeling among dealers that the currency might not break through the Y100 level for some time, if at all.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Mario Nobilo, Croatian ambassador </F> to the United Nations, by unidentified announcer; place not  given; from the "Picture vs Picture" program -- live]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Announcer] In your letter to  the UN Security Council you warn of something that causes fears  here in Croatia, too -- the freezing of the situation. Judging  by all appearances, the Serbs from the occupied territories  accepted the negotiations, but only in order to procrastinate,  that is, to complete the first phase aimed at separation. This  in a way threatens to become a Cyprus-style problem. Are you  afraid of a Cyprus-like situation in Croatia?    [Nobilo] I think that such a danger is always there if this  status quo continues. If it continues throughout this year,  Croatia should cancel the Zagreb agreement. In other words, the  Zagreb agreement is valid only if the next step toward economic  and political issues is made. Failing that, Croatia will have  to make completely different decisions. I belive that a  political solution will be reached as a result of the efforts of  the international community to find a tripartite agreement -- a  bilateral one now in Bosnia. However, if Knin's position  becomes tougher, Croatia will have to make completely different  decisions in completely different circumstances.    [Announcer] What deadline would you consider reasonable to  cancel the Zagreb agreement?    [Nobilo] At the moment, I am not advocating that solution.  All negotiations and the stabilization of the situation follow  the same dynamics. First, the forces must be separated and  peace restored. However, I am speaking about a possible final  scenario. If all serious solutions fail to materialize and if  there is no implementation in the four months that the  international community gave itself, and which coincide with the  UN Protection Force mandate, Croatia should make completely  different decisions than now.

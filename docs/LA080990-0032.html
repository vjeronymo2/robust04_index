			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHANGING THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT  </P> <P> In reading the remarks of Fein and Meese I did not know whether to laugh or  cry. My God, they're serious!  </P> <P> If it prevents us from making money, drive it into extinction. If we do not  immediately recognize some pragmatic benefit to ourselves, let it slip into  oblivion. Put it in a zoo! We've got lumber to cut!  </P> <P> By the beginning of their second paragraph they reveal why they hold the  environment and all "lesser species" in such disdain. They equate "economic  growth with human well-being." Can't breathe? Stay indoors and turn on a fan.  Can't drink the water? Have a beer. Fein and Meese ask who needs spotted owls,  and what is so important about red squirrels? What anemic thinking! What a  display of impoverishment of the soul.  </P> <P> Since 1968 I have been a Republican. In June I registered as a Democrat. As  environmental spokesmen for the Bush Administration, Meese and Fein offer two  of the clearest reasons why I have done so.  </P> <P> RICHARD DUNKERLY  </P> <P> Whittier  </P></p>

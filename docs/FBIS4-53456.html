			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 18 KYODO -- The Japan New Party (JNP),  headed by former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, and its tiny  social democratic ally have agreed to merge to promote  realignment in the nation's political arena, the two parties  said Wednesday [18 May].    Hosokawa and Satsuki Eda, who heads the United Social  Democratic Party (USDP), agreed that the JNP will absorb the  17-year-old party and announce a joint statement Sunday.    The statement will proclaim the two parties' determination  to  promote further political realignment and declare a clear  apology for Japan's behavior during World War II.    The two parties decided on the merger because of the  closeness of their reform-oriented political tenets, officials  said.    Both parties attach importance to decentralization of power  and to more active civil involvement in the political process,  they said.    Two of the three USDP members in the House of  Representatives, Eda and Shogo Abe, will join the new party,  boosting the JNP's strength in the lower house to 39, compared  with 206 for the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), 74 for the  Social Democratic Party (SDP), 62 for Shinseito [Japan Renewal  Party] and 52 for Komeito [Clean Government Party].    But the third USDP legislator, Yanosuke Narazaki, will  become  an independent.    The new JNP will raise the banner of "practical idealism"  after the merger, they said.    The move, however, is unlikely to help consolidate the JNP's  footing, which is becoming more shaky every day, political  analysts said.    The JNP, which is rapidly losing public support, is in a  crisis of splitting as Hosokawa's leadership has been incurably  damaged by his resignation from the premiership over his shady  financial dealings in the 1980s.    Rank-and-file party members are increasingly disgruntled  about the political strategy and handling of Diet business by  the top brass, insiders said.    Three members left the party in April to form a new  parliamentary group, Seiun, after Hosokawa reneged on a promise  to merge with new party Sakigake [Harbinger], headed by former  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura.    Seiun's three members and Sakigake's 15 members have formed  a  joint parliamentary group in the lower house.    One focal point is the issue of dissolving the parliamentary  bloc Kaishin, created by some coalition partners after Tsutomu  Hata was elected to succeed Hosokawa.    The formation of Kaishin infuriated the (SDP) [parentheses  as  received], which was the largest bloc in the ruling coalition  that supported the Hosokawa administration.    The SDP walked out of the coalition, leaving Hata with a  minority government.    Hosokawa on Wednesday supported the idea of scrapping  Kaishin, joining the growing camp in the coalition that calls  for dissolving the Diet club to lure back the SDP into the  coalition.    But chief coalition strategist Ichiro Ozawa of the  coalition's core party Shinseito has expressed strong opposition  to such a move.    The issue engendered a bitter controversy in the JNP over  its  political strategy as a growing number of party members are  critical about Hosokawa's decision to join Kaishin.    The members of Seiun are making overtures to JNP lawmakers  to  leave the party and join their group, and some analysts believe  the JNP is on the verge of a major split.    "The JNP's split is now a matter of time," said one SDP  legislator.</p>

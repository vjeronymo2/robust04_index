			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Kingfisher Innovation has not been Kingfisher's middle name, so the company is perhaps sensible to try out someone else's format for retailing office supplies. And in typically cautious style, Kingfisher's chairman, Mr Geoffrey Mulcahy, is opting for slow development and limited investment. Whether Staples' idea of businesses coming to out-of-town sheds to buy office supplies and equipment will catch on in the UK is an open question. Cosy buyers may prefer to sit in warm offices and deal with existing suppliers, so success will depend on persuading managements the savings are worth the extra effort. That said, other retailers, such as WH Smith, see opportunity in this fragmented market. The main promise seems to lie with small to medium-sized corporate customers which cannot reap economies of scale. The gamble is that by late 1993, when Kingfisher's experiment is under way, small businesses may actually be able to afford new equipment.</p>

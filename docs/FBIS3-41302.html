Guido Tarqui, national settlers secretary from the Bolivian  Labor Federation, said that in the past few days the narcotics  under secretary and a Coca Reduction Directorate (Direco)  official threatened Chapare peasants, urging them to voluntarily  eradicate their coca crops.    He said the two government officials openly threatened the  peasants by telling them that "in case they do not follow the  coca crops eradication plan, the National Social Defense  Secretariat will begin carrying out direct interdiction actions  in the area."    Tarqui said the two officials announced that more coca  eradication employees are being taken to Chapare for the purpose  of eradicating coca crops "by fair means or foul."    Tarqui said this attitude intimidates the peasants, which  may  lead to "clashes and the spilling of blood."    "The peasants are not willing to allow their crops to be  eradicated without any consideration," Tarqui said, adding that  "the only means of living for the area's peasants are coca  leaves."</p>

Addressing a working conference which ended here recently,  Lu  Wenge, director of the provincial committee for restructuring  the economy, mentioned that the share-holding system will also  be applied to energy and infrastructural construction.    He noted that the reform of the property rights system will  be deepened, too. Meanwhile, such sectors as accounting, audit  and law offices as well as the securities exchanges will play  important roles in supervising the process of the reform of  those enterprises.    Zhejiang is one of a handful of provinces which piloted the  introduction of the share-holding system in China in the late  1980s.    Over the past few years, the province has already witnessed  remarkable progress in establishing and expanding the  share-holding system in its state-owned, collective and private  firms.    By the end of 1993, the province had approved some 126  standardized share-holding companies, involving a total  registered capital of about 8.15 billion yuan, according to  official sources.    Of those 126 companies, 15 have issued stock publicly and  eight have been listed on the stock exchanges in Shanghai and  Shenzhen.    In addition to the share-holding system, the formation of  limited liability companies has expanded greatly, with some  1,067 limited liability companies approved in the province by  the end of 1993.    Apart from the step-by-step transformation of state-owned  enterprises to the share-holding system, some 700 small  collective firms as well as more than 60,000 rural enterprises  have also adopted the new system of cooperative share-holding.    Through transforming management mechanisms, most of the  share- holding companies have collected enough money to enlarge  the production scale and have already made greater profits.    Meanwhile, the province has also made progress by  introducing  the share-holding system in the development of such basic  industries as energy, transportation and telecommunications,  which had hindered the development of the economy as a whole  because of a lack of construction funds.    Yan Chunyou, an official under the provincial committee for  restructuring the economy, said, "the reform of the  share-holding system is the key to the modern enterprise system,  and it's an effective way to enlarge the production scale of  those firms who adopt this system and to improve their  performance in both international and domestic markets."    The introduction of the share-holding system has not only  defined property rights clearly but also boosted reforms in the  employment, distribution and management systems of the  enterprises, Yan said.    China is now making painstaking efforts to transform the  management mechanism of its state-owned enterprises, in a bid to  build a modern enterprise system, one of the major objectives of  its economic development.</p>

			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Japan announced it will pardon 30,000 people in a general amnesty that includes  restoration of civil rights to about 11 million people. The amnesty, intended  as a gift to the people to commemorate the death of Emperor Hirohito, will take  effect Feb. 24, the day of Hirohito's funeral. The amnesty was immediately  criticized as being selective and politically motivated because it includes  thousands of politicians and campaign workers convicted of breaking election  laws. The measure is in line with the Japanese tradition of granting pardons to  mark significant events in the country's history.  </P></p>

			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Mexico begins to change tune on Nafta MEXICO is slightly changing its tune on the North American Free Trade Agreement. Once hailed as the crowning achievement of President Carlos Salinas, officials are at pains to stress it is now just one element of the government's economic plan and certainly not indispensable to future stability and growth. The shift in emphasis has come as negotiations on side agreements have dragged out longer than expected and Congressional opposition has grown. Mexican officials, including the president, who used to insist there would be a pact by January 1 next year, now prefer to say there will be a treaty 'eventually'. The irony is that Canada, long considered Mexico's ally in Nafta negotiations, seems the stumbling block. According to reports in Mexico, an agreement would already have been reached had Canada not objected to imposition of a combination of fines and sanctions on countries that do not enforce their environmental and labour laws. If Canada does not budge, Mexico faces the dilemma of whether it should enter into its own side agreements with the US, excluding Canada, to break the impasse. Since the US Congress is worried about the lack of Mexican rather than Canadian enforcement of labour and environmental laws, this might break the impasse but would be considered an embarrassing defeat for Mexico. Reports that Canada would be excluded from some of the interventionist provisions of the side agreements were firmly denied in a communique issued by the three countries on Monday. A Mexican official expressed optimism yesterday that an agreement which applied equally to the three could still be found.</p>

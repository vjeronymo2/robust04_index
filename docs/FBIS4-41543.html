			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 25 Jun -- "To unite the forces of people's  deputies of all levels, from the union level to rayon soviets,  including deputies of the present elected authorities, in the  fight for the restoration of a single union state, the Soviet  Union." This task was set at the third congress of the "Union"  popular movement [narodnoye dvizheniye "Soyuz"], held today at  the Russian Federation parliamentary center.    The movement was set up in December 1990 on the basis of the  "Union" group of deputies, which advocated the preservation of a  centralized unitarian state and "emergency measures to steer the  country out of crisis." Its second congress was held in April  1991, so the present forum was the first since the breakup of  the USSR. The congress organizers claim they managed to gather  330 deputies of various levels, including 33 former people's  deputies of the USSR, 20 former people's deputies of the Russian  Federation, and four State Duma deputies. Apart from them, the  congress was attended by representatives from parties and public  movements, mainly of the communist and nationalist-patriotic  orientation.    The delegates approved a resolution that proclaims the  intention to submit to the parliaments of former republics of  the USSR a proposal to denounce the Belovezhskaya Pushcha  agreements, and also to urge all public movements in the  independent states [of the CIS] "to start work on expanding  interrepublican ties and forming on the basis of these ties a  broad movement for the restoration of a single state." The  movement expressed its intention to take an active part in  preparing the second "Congress of Peoples of the USSR," which is  scheduled for October-November 1994. The congress approved  "theses of a blueprint for the restoration of a union state,"  proposed by the previous congress.    Former USSR People's Deputy Sazhi Umalatova said in an  interview with the ITAR-TASS correspondent she was confident  that "all the republic without exceptions, including the Baltic  ones," would return to the revived union. However, Viktor  Alksnis, a leader of the "Union" group of deputies, told the  ITAR-TASS correspondent that he cherished no particular  illusions about the movement's prospects. Much will depend on  whether there are funds, he noted.</p>

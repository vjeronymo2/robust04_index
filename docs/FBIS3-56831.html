"The State Duma has from the first to show itself as a  proponent of a strong Russia," Olesk said. "The Russian  president and government would rather avoid a sharp clash with  the State Duma.    "Obviously, if Russia again begins to lay claim to the  Baltic  Sea, our independence gets in the way," Olesk noted.    The population minister admitted that some of Russia's  latest  anti-Baltic statements may be "purely propaganda."    "This, however, shouldn't mislead us," Olesk said. "It is  not  in the interests of the Western powers that another hotbed of  tension emerge in Europe.    "In this case, they may insist that we conduct a consistent  policy that doesn't put up the back of Russia or its citizens  abroad."    Olesk said Russian officials' statement that Russia won't  allow a security vacuum in Estonia gives cause for worry.    "It gives to understand, among other things, that it is  Estonia's independence without the presence of foreign troops  that creates a security vacuum," he said. "I don't hesitate to  say that Moscow attaches great importance to leaving behind a  great number of Russians to be used as a tool for interfering in  Estonian domestic affairs and Estonia's fate.    "Russia needs a pretext for protecting Russians' interests  in  Estonia, not for protecting them in Russia," Olesk charged.    The minister maintained Russia's ideology is largely based  on  the principle of dual citizenship.    "If we don't know the identity of Russian citizens residing  in Estonia, it may easily happen that those anonymous citizens  get involved in provocations and Estonian policy acquires the  reputation of failing to guarantee the security of Russian  citizens," Olesk said.    The population minister gave top priority to the  continuation  of the Estonian-Russian negotiations as a means for ironing out  problems between the two countries.</p>

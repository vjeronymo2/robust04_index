			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Brussels approves state aid for Fiat THE European Commission yesterday approved up to L5,189bn (Pounds 2.5bn) of state aid for Fiat, the Italian carmaker, one of the largest state subsidies sanctioned by Brussels in recent years. The aid is part of a wide-ranging L12,000bn programme of investment by the Italian group in the depressed Mezzogiorno region of southern Italy, including the construction of a car plant and an engine plant. The Commission decided that L10,442bn of investment was eligible for regional and research subsidies of which it has approved L4,884bn for regional subsidies and a soft loan of L305bn for research. Commission officials said yesterday that although Italy was adding capacity of 450,000 small cars, most of that increase would be offset by capacity cuts in northern Italy. 'Overall (the plan) adds only 0.2 to EC car capacity,' said an official, and 3 per cent to Fiat group capacity. The Commission also judged that the difficulty of opening plants in the Mezzogiorno and the region's serious economic problems justified a high level of government aid. The Commission said that although the investment was being made immediately, the subsidies would be paid at the end of the project in 1995. The impact may be diluted to around 30.5 per cent of the eligible expenditure. The Commission approved aid yesterday of DM260m for a new Opel car plant at Eisenach in eastern Germany, part of a total investment of DM1.27bn.</p>

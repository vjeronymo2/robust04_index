			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Adams is 'open to persuasion' Mr Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, is 'very open to being persuaded' that the Downing Street declaration provides a basis for an end to the IRA's military campaign, he said yesterday. But in a long statement he insisted that there was a need for clarifications of the declaration and for 'immediate and unconditional dialogue with both governments'. He said Sinn Fein would respond positively to efforts to close a perceived gap between the Hume-Adams peace initiative - which was launched last September by Mr Adams and Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party - and the Downing Street declaration. But he accused the British government of being 'belligerent, arrogant and provocative' in statements subsequent to the declaration last December. 'I am quite confident that the IRA would respond positively to a package containing the principles, process and dynamic (of the Hume-Adams initiative) . . . up to now I do not have any political package with which to approach the IRA,' he said. Mr Adams said that key issues in Sinn Fein's strategy were that the British government should end partition 'and hand over sovereignty to an all-Ireland government', that the British government should 'influence unionist attitudes' in this direction, and that the London and Dublin governments 'should consult together to seek agreement on the policy objective of ending partition'. He said a viable peace process was 'dependent on the adoption of the (Hume-Adams) proposals by the two governments'. Mr Hume has already welcomed the Downing Street declaration. Mr Adams lays great emphasis on the British government becoming 'persuaders' of the unionist community in Northern Ireland to accept an all-Ireland solution, a point which has been emphatically ruled out by the UK government. The Irish government insists that many of Sinn Fein's concerns have been addressed by the joint declaration, and has attempted to persuade the party to accept it by offering further clarifications, lifting a 20-year broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein, and an immediate seat at a new 'peace forum' in the republic if the IRA ended its military campaign.</p>

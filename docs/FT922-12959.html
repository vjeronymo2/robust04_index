			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / World Trade News: Japan hits at American anti-trust intentions JAPAN'S fair trade commissioner yesterday protested at US plans to enforce American anti-trust laws against foreign companies, AP reports from Tokyo. US Commerce officials attending a Tokyo conference on anti-monopoly laws say a recent decision to carry out such enforcement dates back to 1890. But the long precedent does not impress Japanese officials, who assert they will appeal to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development for help to block the US plan. Mr Setsuo Umezawa, Japan Fair Trade Commission chairman, said he feared attempts to enforce US anti-trust rules against Japanese companies would 'obstruct economic relations' and damage mutual trust between the two anti-monopoly watchdogs. 'Violations should be dealt with by the authorities in the country where they occur.' The US and Japan have agreed to end some differences in US and Japanese business and legal traditions, to minimise trade friction. But Mr Umezawa said he believed extra-territorial enforcement by the US Fair Trade Commission would be going too far.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Bratislava REPUBLIKA in Slovak on 30  April on page 2 carries a 200-word TA SR report on President  Michal Kovac's visit to Cadca, center of the Kysuce region in  north Slovakia, on 29 April and the speech he made on the  occasion. On 3 May, the same newspaper on page 3 carries a  600-word Viera Urbanova commentary criticizing the "escalating  attacks" on former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, with special  emphasis on President Kovac's speech in Cadca.    The TA SR report includes the following passage: "President  Kovac said that he came to the Kysuce region to get to know the  region's problems on the spot and to gain a better understanding  of them. He also explained some of the reasons that led to the  recent change in the Slovak Government. According to his words,  many of the former government's practices had long signaled a  discrepancy between its proclamations and actual deeds. The  prime minister's autocratic method of government, the  suppression of different views, defamations, not saying the  whole truth, and the scandalization of people from other  political entities were the main reason for the government's  loss of favor and support even among some of its own deputies,  the president added."    The Urbanova commentary is entitled "Meciar Persecution  Mania--Remedy for Unemployment?" The author observes that the  new government coalition, "which is pledged to pursuing  civilized policies without confrontational tones," is doing the  exact opposite, and its "attacks" on the former prime minister  "are even escalating." In this context, she says: "The  president, who, as head of state, should be, first and foremost,  a moral authority, should stand above matters, and should apply  the same yardstick to anyone, has not managed to step over his  shadow of a provincial politician. During his visit to north  Slovakia, Michal Kovac defied everything of which he wants (and  should) be a safeguard: calm and peace, which Slovakia needs the  most. In Zilina, he spoke about reconciliation, and, in  neighboring Cadca, he once again fully exposed his Meciar  persecution mania, which he finds so difficult to conceal. If  the head of state wants to get to know the problems of a region,  why does he have to lower himself to calling the chairman of the  Movement for a Democratic Slovakia names? It is very doubtful  whether this attitude of the president will resolve unemployment  or calm down passions among people. It seems that tolerance,  statesmanlike wisdom, and foresight still have not made it to  our latitudes, while the discrepancy between proclamations and  actual deeds is thriving here."</p>

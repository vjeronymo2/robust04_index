			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / International Company News: Amic, Daewoo establish white goods joint venture ANGLO AMERICAN Industrial Corporation (Amic) of South Africa and the South Korean Daewoo group have established a 50-50 joint venture to manufacture high-value consumer goods and exploit international technology markets. Mr Leslie Boyd, chairman of Amic, the industrial arm of the Anglo American group, said the deal with Daewoo was part of Amic's strategy to reduce its dependence on cyclical commodity markets. The alliance with an Asian partner is an important one for Anglo, which has traditionally found its partners in Europe. Daewoo-Amic, the new company, will make an initial investment of about R20m (Dollars 6m) to take a 29.99 per cent stake in Gentech, a company that manufactures and distributes household electrical appliances. The basis for the venture includes growth potential in the southern African white goods market and Daewoo's extensive technology base and exposure to consumer durables. The establishment by the new company of a local colour picture tube (CPT) manufacturing facility for televisions is also being considered. Giving the reasons for the Daewoo tie-up, Mr Boyd said Amic needed Daewoo's specific technology and international marketing skills to establish itself 'boldly in downstream consumer industries'. Daewoo saw South Africa as a developing consumer market, and needed Anglo's financial partnership and operating skills. South African companies suffered during the sanctions era from the lack of transfer of technology. Anglo often said it was seeking joint venture partners. Part of Amic's reason for seeking a Korean partner was the idea that Korean investors were more willing to accept the risks of the South African environment than US, Japanese or European investors. Korea is also felt to be better attuned to the needs of developing countries, particularly regarding how to use labour-intensive manufacturing methods without sacrificing international competitiveness. Altech, Amic's electronics associate, has a tie-up with the French group, Alcatel, while Samcor, the motor manufacturer in which Amic has a 19 per cent stake, has close ties with Ford.</p>

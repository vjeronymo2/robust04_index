			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAL STATE A STEP CLOSER IN ITS BID FOR RANCH  </P> <P> Despite environmental protests, California State University on Wednesday came a  step closer toward placing a campus on Taylor Ranch west of Ventura.  </P> <P> The university's Board of Trustees voted to approve a final environmental  impact report for the ranch, including a series of measures designed to lessen  damage to the scenic hillside property.  </P> <P> Although not all the negative impact could be mitigated, the board concluded:  "The project will have positive humanistic, educational and cultural impact on  the area, which will override the adverse environmental impact."  </P> <P> The move was immediately criticized by Patagonia, the Ventura-based outdoor  clothing company, which contends that Cal State's report seriously  underestimated the negative impact of development on the seaside bluff.  </P> <P> The firm, which commissioned a private study of the report, charged that the  document is based on only 2,000 students initially attending the two-year  extension facility, while ignoring the possibility of expansion to a four-year  school with several thousand more students.  </P> <P> "We think they're dealing in bad faith," said Patagonia spokesman Kevin  Sweeney, adding that a recent California Supreme Court decision would back up  the company's case. "We intend to fight this site through whatever means  available."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Medicine Man  </P> <P> Patagonia also submitted a letter on behalf of a Chumash medicine man, further  objecting to any development. In the letter, Kote Lotah, an An'tap priest from  Ventura, said the ranch was "a well-known ceremonial shrine" that "has  tremendous spiritual and religious significance to our people."  </P> <P> The Board of Trustees, in approving the report, acknowledged that development  of a 465-acre parcel of the ranch would have an adverse environmental impact on  traffic, air quality and solid-waste disposal, and could possibly disturb  ancient Chumash Indian burial grounds.  </P> <P> However, to lessen those impacts, a series of measures were also approved,  including widening several city streets, encouraging car pools, developing a  recycling program, conducting a detailed archeological study and using hooded  street lamps to reduce glare from the hillside.  </P> <P> Still, the report indicated that not all of the impacts could be reduced, which  required the trustees under state law to rule that the benefits to be derived  from the proposed university created "overriding considerations" that  outweighed any adverse environmental impact.  </P> <P> Should the campus need to grow, Cal State officials said they see no problem in  conducting another environmental impact report to assess the expanded facility.  </P> <P> For now, though, Cal State views its biggest hurdle as acquiring the property,  which is owned by Santa Barbara residents Ailene B. Claeyssens and her  daughter, Cynthia Wood, who have refused to sell.  </P> <P> The university is taking steps, including preparation of the environmental  impact report and an appraisal of the property, that are consistent with  purchasing the land through eminent domain, a power granted to public agencies  for acquiring private land for public purposes.  </P> <P> The trustees will ask the state Department of General Services to take the  necessary steps to acquire the property, officials said. Meanwhile, the  university will make Claeyssens and Wood an offer on the land.  </P></p>

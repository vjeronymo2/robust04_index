			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Black economy blurs M0 message: Gillian Tett on why the reliability of the money-supply measure is being questioned If an economist from Mars had picked up a copy of yesterday's money supply figures he or she might have had cause to blink. The annual rate of growth in June of M0, the narrowest measure of money supply, was 6.8 per cent. For more than a year the government and the Bank of England have been solemnly proclaiming that M0's 'monitoring' range should be zero to 4 per cent. So the question that an onlooker might ask, as M0 has been soaring out of its target range for several months, is why the rise has not prompted more outcry from the City or the Bank itself? The main reason, economists say, is a new scepticism about the reliability of M0 as an indicator of high street activity. Many analysts suspect the data are being skewed by low interest rates, changes in banking technology and even the growth of new black-economy activities such as car boot sales. M0, which chiefly comprises notes and coins in circulation, has traditionally been of interest to economists for two reasons. First, the figures have been a useful guide to future inflation. Second, they have often provided an early guide to retail sales because more spending creates a greater demand for cash. In the past six months this relationship has broken down as M0 has surged at a much faster rate than high street spending. The Bank blames the rise primarily on low interest rates. If consumers are not receiving much interest on their bank accounts, the argument goes, they will tend to hold more cash, and so the 'velocity' at which money circulates will slow. This analysis has been accepted by many City economists, who point out that a similar pattern has occurred in the US. Some analysts are resorting to recalculating the target band to take account of the low velocity. Mr John Marsland of the UBS bank believes that if interest rates are considered, the 'real' target limit should be 6.5 per cent. But as a recent Bank of England research report on the subject admitted: 'Gauging the extent to which this fall (in velocity) arises from recent changes in interest rates is difficult.' The guesswork is made harder because interest rates are only one of the factors that influence how consumers use cash. Mr Don Smith of Midland Global Markets believes another influence on M0's growth may be the recent shift towards part-time work, where employees are more likely to be paid in cash. Meanwhile, the growing use of large-denomination bank notes may indicate that consumers are spending more in the cash-based, black-market economy. Mr Bernard Tennant, retail sales director at the British Chambers of Commerce, says its research shows there has been an 'explosion' in the number of car boot sales, with at least 1,500 taking place every week. But calculating whether this kind of factor affects M0 is extremely difficult because of the lack of information about the black economy. Meanwhile, changes in banking technology may be affecting the use of cash. The fact that the number of Pounds 20 notes has risen by almost 30 per cent in the past three years and overtaken the Pounds 10 note as the most common denomination, for example, is presumed to reflect their popularity in bank cash-dispensers. In spite of this uncertainty the Bank shows no sign of abandoning its emphasis on M0 yet. As the Bank's report pointed out, comparisons between retail price inflation and M0 in the past 25 years show that M0 has been an accurate predictor of inflation up to six months ahead. Nevertheless, the same report admitted that it could 'find no convincing explanation' why M0 should have these predictive powers. Indeed, with the government committed to maintaining inflation well below the level predicted by the current M0 data, the Bank has every reason to hope that the current mis-match between M0 and retail sales will produce another statistical discrepancy in six months - this time between M0 and retail price inflation.</p>

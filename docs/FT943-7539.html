			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Russians become tangled in Tajik power struggle Tajikistan's remote Pamir mountains were once a favourite hunting spot for Moscow's leaders, who prized the Soviet southeast's bighorn Marco Polo sheep. These days, however, Russians in the Central Asia republic are as likely as not themselves to feel like the hunted. Late last week, seven Russian soldiers were killed in a fierce cross-border raid in Tajikistan by a more and more daring, Afghanistan-based opposition. The deaths followed an intense period of assassinations and ambushes against a 25,000-strong Russian military force deployed on the southern Tajikistan border with Afghanistan. The force, sent ostensibly to prevent the republic's instability from spreading to Russia, has become increasingly bogged down and besieged. 'This (the attack) is a reflection of the opposition's existing strength, and partly its desperation,' said a diplomat in Dushanbe, interviewed by telephone yesterday. 'We haven't seen the full fury yet.' In committing itself to propping up the Dushanbe government, composed of old guard hard-liners from the previous Communist administration, Moscow has said it is fighting a radical Islamic opposition, and the regional reverberations that could erupt if it came to power. Western analysts believe that the opposition's Islamic component has been exaggerated. Moscow may be sensitive about a new war being fought on former Soviet territory against forces in Afghanistan. But, analysts say, the deployment is also part of a wider policy in which Russia, while loosening up elsewhere, has entrenched itself in all the Central Asian and Caucasus republics that it has dominated for more than a century. Rather than a battle against militant Islam, the Russian troops have become tangled in a two-year-old power struggle between regional clans, intractable disputes that go back to the beginning of the Soviet era. The battle pits the former Soviet elite against an opposition of traditional have-nots from the rural Garm and Pamir areas in central and eastern Tajikistan. The fighting began as a purely political struggle in the last months of the Soviet period, when the government loosened its grip on the opposing opinions. In the ensuing months, the neo-Communist government found itself increasingly beleaguered by a growing opposition coalition comprising intellectuals, self-described democrats, Islamic leaders and students. In autumn 1992, the opposition took power. But within weeks it was overthrown by tanks, jets and troops provided by Moscow and neighbouring Uzbekistan. Some 60,000 Garm and Pamir people fled across the Amu Darya River to Afghanistan when the elite unleashed an ethnic-cleansing campaign in which thousands died. More than 30,000 refugees remain across the Amu Darya, among whom are the fighters who today dog the Russians. The fighting, and the attacks against the Russians, look unlikely to end soon. A principal reason is regional politics. Afghanistan, Iran and Uzbekistan are all in the fray with Russia. Russia's support for Mr Imamali Rakhmanov, the Tajikistan president, remains the most important element of Tajik politics. In exchange for Russia's assistance, Mr Rakhmanov has allowed Moscow to control his economy and military. It is hard to name any important policy or programme that is Mr Rakhmanov's own. But the region's other players have made Moscow's role ever more dangerous.</p>

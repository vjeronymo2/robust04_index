			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: News in brief Flat owners thinking of using new legislation to extend their leases, or club together to buy their freehold, can now get free advice. The Leasehold Enfranchisement Advisory Service has been set up jointly by the Department of the Environment and a number of private sector organisations. The service will advise leaseholders and freeholders directly as well as publishing information leaflets and lists of professionals able to help with the enfranchisement process. Since November 1 1993, leaseholders have had the right to extend their leases or buy the freehold if they meet certain conditions, but the regulations are very complicated and the process takes several months to complete. LEAS can be contacted at 6/8 Maddox Street, London W1R 9PN (tel. 071-493 3116). * * * Abbey Life has joined Hypo F&amp;C and Morgan Grenfell in launching a high-income unit trust Pep which uses derivatives to provide the higher income. The Extra Income Pep is based on a new fund and aims to preserve capital over the long term, while providing a monthly income fixed at 2 percentage points above base rates. Maximum payout is 13 per cent, so investors will not benefit from base rates rising above 11 per cent. About 55 per cent of the underlying fund will be invested in UK blue chip shares and another 40 per cent will be in derivatives, mainly futures and options. The balance will be held in cash. This is potentially a less risky fund in terms of preserving capital than the others, which pay 10 per cent, since the income stream is linked to base rates. Investors should check to see that they are happy with the performance of Abbey funds. Minimum investment is Pounds 3,000. Initial charge is 6 per cent and annual management fee is 1.5 per cent. There is a 1 percentage point bonus until April 29. * * * Pilling &amp; Co., a Manchester-based stockbroker, has cut the minimum dealing charge on its self-select personal equity plans to Pounds 10 from Pounds 30. The dealing commission rate is 1.65 per cent. There is no charge for setting up a plan and no annual fee, but there is a Pounds 6.75 fee for each dividend on which tax has to be reclaimed. Investors can hold any qualifying stock in the Pep and get free advice from Pilling's dealers. * * * Norwich Union is offering a 3 percentage point discount on lump sum investments of Pounds 3,000 or more into its Pep unit trusts, bringing the bid-offer spread down to 3 per cent until March 29. Pep investors can choose between four unit trusts instead of two. These are Norwich Union's UK Equity Growth, UK Equity Income, UK Smaller Companies and European trusts. Annual charge is 1.5 per cent. * * * Yorkshire building society has launched its own telephone share dealing service through its subsidiary, YorkSHARE. Until the end of July, the minimum commission on telephone deals will be Pounds 9. Commission on deals up to Pounds 4,800 is 0.75 per cent, while deals over Pounds 4,800 will cost Pounds 36 plus 0.1 per cent on excess over Pounds 4,800. From July 31, the charges will be 1 per cent (minimum Pounds 14), and Pounds 48 (plus 0.1 per cent) on deals over Pounds 4,800. There is a one-off membership fee of Pounds 5.</p>

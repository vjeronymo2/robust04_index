			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Nahum Barne'a: "Caught With Their Pants </F> Down"]    [Text] Whether it was an act of unlucky bungling or malice,  negligence, or deliberately pulling the wool over our eyes --  whatever the reasons, it is hard to deny one thing: Our  government was caught with its pants down.    Peres sent a letter and Rabin sent Shahal to the Knesset  podium to deny it. It is an embarrassing event, perhaps the  most embarrassing since this government was founded. The  biggest scandal is not the contents of the letter but the  attempt to deny its existence. Up to now, we have known that  one party to the Oslo agreement -- Yasir 'Arafat -- has a  credibility problem. Now we are starting to understand that the  other side has a problem, too.    The letter was sent after tough wrangling between Israel and  the PLO. 'Arafat demanded the personal status of patron of the  Christian and Muslim holy sites, as well as a permanent  political entity in East Jerusalem. Israel wanted to totally  circumvent the Jerusalem issue.    In the end, if our government sources yesterday told the  whole truth, 'Arafat gave up including the Jerusalem issue in  the agreement and its annexes. Israel, for its part, agreed to  send Norwegian Foreign Minister Johan Jorgen Holst a letter  summing up Palestinian rights in East Jerusalem. The letter has  an annex containing sections on Jerusalem from Peres' speech to  the Knesset -- that is, if they are telling the whole truth.    The letter undertakes to uphold and respect all the  Palestinian institutions in the eastern part of the city: They  are performing an essential task. Israel will not hamper their  activity; on the contrary, it will encourage them. The same  holds true for the Muslim and Christian holy sites.    This implies the beginning of recognition of 'Arafat's  preeminent status over Christian and Muslim assets in East  Jerusalem -- not Saudi Arabia's, not Jordan's, not even an  international body's, but the PLO's. It, of course, involves  recognition of the activity of the PLO institutions in  Jerusalem. 'Arafat was inaccurate when he said in his  Johannesburg speech that the undertaking was given to him in  Cairo, but he did not lie when he said that he had received a  commitment.    Dan Meridor suspected that there was some truth to 'Arafat's  remarks. He should be praised for his investigation. Twice,  Moshe Shahal got up in the name of the government to clarify  'Arafat's remarks, and twice he said there was no letter.  Shahal received his information from Eytan Haber, head of the  prime minister's bureau. Shim'on Peres was on a tour of North  and Latin America at the time. He did not know whether the  government was telling the truth.    Last week, Rabin addressed the Knesset Foreign Affairs and  Defense Committee. Meridor called on Beni Begin to question the  prime minister. Begin exerted pressure; Rabin wriggled out of  by answering: "To the best of my knowledge, there is no letter  to 'Arafat." It was a semiadmission.    It is true that the letter was not addressed to 'Arafat but  to Holst. It is true that the Rabin government did not hurt the  status quo in Jerusalem. It was the Shamir government that  approved the activities of the PLO institutions in Jerusalem,  under the direction of Orient House. It made a grave mistake,  from its point of view. In fact, Peres wrote to Holst what  Shamir had authorized for al-Husayni.    That does not significantly change the fact that Rabin and  Peres were caught with their pants down. For days, they have  been humoring us with the story that the Peres letter is merely  a reiteration of the position he expressed in the Knesset debate  on the Oslo agreement. I read the speech and the letter. In  the speech, Peres said that "each community in Jerusalem can  uphold its cultural tradition, its special character, its  social, religious, and other institutions." He barely deserves  a passing grade for the resemblance between the two versions.    For months we were told that 'Arafat represents a different  culture, a different mentality. We are responsible for every  word we utter; he lies through his teeth. The letter incident  has somewhat blurred the differences. This may be the new  Middle East Peres has been talking about so much.</p>

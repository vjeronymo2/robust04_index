			<p>BFN     [Text] Mohamed Abdelaziz, secretary general of the  Polisario Front, held a news conference at the 27 February  national school, attended by the national and Spanish media  accompanying a visiting Spanish delegation.    The brother president said that the Western Sahara issue is  an issue of special interest and was the subject of deep concern  for the presidents of the African states who attended the 30th  OAU summit.    The brother president pointed out that the latest proposal  put forward by the Polisario Front, calling for the convening of  an international conference for giving a boost to the UN peace  plan on Western Sahara, is considered by the organization as a  constructive initiative and was approved in a report by the OAU  secretary general.    With regard to a question related to Morocco's stance, which  rejects OAU participation, the brother president said that  Morocco has constantly used all forms of maneuvering and  procrastination and today it rejects the OAU participation in  the identification process and this is a blatant violation of  the text and spirit of the UN-OAU peace plan based on African  resolution 104.    The brother president added: Through our contacts with the  various African heads of states, we made a full denunciation of  the Moroccan stance which calls basically for blowing up the  UN-OAU peace plan, stipulating the organization of a free, just,  and unbiased referendum for the Saharan people. He highlighted  that this Moroccan stance is dangerous and would put Morocco in  a clear and open conflict with the UN, the OAU and international  legality. [passage indistinct].    The brother president said that the Saharan people are  preparing for all possibilities and will continue to give  serious and full cooperation to the UN and the OAU [passage  indistinct].</p>

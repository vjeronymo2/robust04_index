			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Time running out for EU image: The protracted enlargement voting dispute has a political price The European Union's festering internal row over voting rights if it opens its doors to Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway risks destroying already muted Euro-enthusiasm among the electorates of the applicant countries, all of which have to submit EU membership to a referendum. The four putative newcomers have agreed hard-bargained entry terms. But their ministers now have to turn up in Brussels on an almost weekly basis, waiting in their embassies or hotels on the off-chance that the UK and Spain and their 10 partners can decide on how many countries should be entitled to block Euro-laws. EU foreign ministers again failed to resolve this dispute yesterday, at the fourth time of asking. Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, increasingly uncomfortable with the hand he has been dealt, acknowledged yesterday that 'there is time pressure'. 'We are well aware of the time-scale, but agreement requires movement by everybody,' he said. Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, summed up well the mood of the EU majority, when he warned that Europe's reputation was being seriously damaged. 'We are showing that we can't do our business properly, and we are creating a bad impression among the electorates of the applicant countries,' he said. A senior official from Finland - the only applicant country which as of now has near majority opinion in favour of Europe - said: 'We have to cut this off now and get on with the (membership) process.' In the minds of all the negotiators, there is concern that the deadline for the four to enter in January next year is slipping away. In the minds of some, there is fear that this deadline is not academic - that it could cause a fatal loss of political momentum which could turn Nordic and Alpine voters against Europe, and that the Union would take a long time to recover from such self-inflicted wounds. Deadlines on the Uruguay Round, on the European Economic Area free trade zone, and on previous enlargements, were missed without final mishap. The formal deadline at issue here is May 4, by when the European parliament must approve the accession treaty. It says firmly it will not if the UK and Spain get their way in making it more difficult for the EU to take decisions. British and Spanish ministers profess to believe that if they can get a legal text on enlargement to parliament by about April 5, along with a compromise on majority voting which leans their way, EU expansion can go ahead as planned. But there is more to reckon with. Senior parliament officials already say that even if the argument on voting rights goes their way, they doubt that the Strasbourg assembly - up for re-election in June - would be willing or able to deliver approval in time. Many MEPs will be absent campaigning; about half are set to lose their seats and may not turn up; up to a third never turn up anyway. The parliament received important new powers, including that of veto, under the Maastricht treaty, and resents the way the member states continue to treat it as a talking shop. The Socialist and Christian Democrat apparatchiks who control the Euro-assembly definitely hold a whip hand on enlargement, and are in a mood to demonstrate they are nobody's rubber-stamp. But the longer the votes debate goes on, the less likely it is that parliaments in the 10 member states who oppose leaving the 'blocking minority' on decision-making unchanged will endorse ratification. Already Belgium and Holland have said that they will not get through a bill which enshrines quasi-veto powers for countries such as the UK. 'The longer you leave it, the more people are going to speak up on the other side,' a Dutch diplomat warned yesterday. 'And then you have a real political crisis.'</p>

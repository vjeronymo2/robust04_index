			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Lyubov Tsukanova article: "Accord Must Mature Within </F> Society. At the Moment, However, Only the Politicians Are  Active"]    [Text] A Civic Accord Assembly will be convened in the  Kremlin on 28 April for the signing of the Agreement on Civil  Peace. The document will be open for amendments, comments, and  suggestions until 20 April.    Thus there is very little time left. However, no great  activeness has been observed yet among the potential parties to  the agreement.    The Social Democratic Party of Russia has clearly announced  its readiness to sign the memorandum. The Party of  Consolidation supports the idea of the agreement. The Majority  Party, one of the "newest" Russian parties, has expressed its  attitude toward the contract. It is a very ambivalent attitude,  let us note: While supporting the idea of consensus itself, the  party's leadership has announced a readiness to affiliate to the  agreement only if it is substantially reworked.    Given that according to fundamental political, economic,  social, moral, and ethical criteria there exist not just  different but even opposing viewpoints, it may be that even  those political forces which are amenable to accord will not be  able to agree "point by point" and that the memorandum will be  signed by only those few opposition organizations which even  without a special agreement are taking part in political  activity on a strictly constitutional basis and according to  constructive principles.    But it is the passivity of the population which is surely  the  most worrying factor. Of course, the nonparticipation of the  overwhelming majority of citizens in the conciliation process is  not evidence of the indifference of the masses toward their own  fate and that of the country but is the result, on the one hand,  of the exceptionally weak influence of political organizations  among the masses and, on the other, of a fairly formal attitude  toward the process on the part of the power structures at all  levels.    There is a third reason as well. Many (not only in number  but also in scope) nonpolitical and social organizations --  various types of unions, societies, associations, and  foundations -- have been excluded from the conciliation process.  Reliance on a party whose only interest lies in the struggle  for power is surely less promising as regards accord than the  involvement in the peacemaking process of nonpoliticized  associations which have a much broader base among the masses,  are the fundation of a civic society, and could form a  reasonable, calm, and constructive counterweight to the  politicians' ambitious aspirations.</p>

			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> FRAT HOUSES ORDERED TO MAKE REPAIRS  </P> <P> City inspectors toured two closed fraternity houses this week and issued a list  of items that must be corrected before residents can return.  </P> <P> The lists show what work must be performed to convert the houses to their  original uses as four-unit apartments, City Planner Ted J. Commerdinger said.  </P> <P> Owners of the units can request a reinspection once the units are brought up to  code, he said.  </P> <P> Residents of the Sigma Pi and Sigma Alpha Epsilon houses moved out March 23, a  month after the City Council ordered all fraternity activities at the houses to  stop and for the units to be converted to apartments.  </P> <P> Fraternity members had applied for permits to continue holding fraternity  events at the two units, but the council denied their requests in February amid  complaints by neighbors and police of noise and raucous behavior.  </P> <P> The fraternity houses are across the street from each other in a residential  area north of the Cal State Fullerton campus. Five other fraternity and  sorority houses operate in the area of the closed houses.  </P> <P> Once work on the units is complete, fraternity members will be allowed to  return as long as no fraternity activities take place on the property, city  officials have said. The fraternities will be allowed to reapply for operating  permits in August. TOM McQUEENEY  </P></p>

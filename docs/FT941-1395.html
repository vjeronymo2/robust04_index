			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Export order books strong UK manufacturers' export order books are close to their best level for almost four years, but low total orders point to weakening domestic demand, the Confederation of British Industry says in its March survey of industrial trends today. But manufacturers expect output to maintain a firmly upward trend over the next four months and inflationary pressures to remain subdued. The survey says export order books have improved over the last month. With 22 per cent of manufacturers saying that export order books are above normal and 28 per cent describing them as below normal, the negative balance of 6 per cent is close to the best recorded since June 1990. Total order books are described as above normal by 17 per cent of companies and below normal by 30 per cent, a negative balance of 13 per cent, a slight deterioration since last month - suggesting that domestic demand for UK manufactured goods may be slackening ahead of April's tax increases. But the CBI says the trend has improved markedly since March last year, when there was a negative balance of 27 per cent. Together with February's balance, overall demand is at its best level since December 1989.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Jan Benes commentary: "About Deputy Minister Kalousek's </F> 'Expedient Lie'"]    [Text] In the course of an extraordinary news conference  called by the defense minister to calm down the public, Deputy  Defense Minister Kalousek described the CESKY DENIK information  about contributing to Klinlab equipment with Army supplies as an  expedient lie. The deputy minister is apparently well-versed in  the field so he knew what he was talking about. What he said  was an expedient untruth.    This time around, we will not devote our attention to the  problem of biological warfare agents (for, at this time, the  explanation of the difference between an offensive and defensive  cholera is beyond our ability).    We will leave that for some other time, including the  military laboratories in Olesnice, as well as the equipment for  the reproduction of viruses, with which the Techonin Research  Institute was equipped despite the claims made by the Defense  Ministry officials calming down the public. After all, it was  from here that the Bulgarian, Romanian, GDR, and Russian experts  -- who used to work here -- withdrew their research and  documentation.    So, that is one group of expedient untruths. Let us,  however, devote ourselves to the Klinlab Co., a company that  operates in the building of the Military Hospital in  [Prague-]Stresovice. It was precisely in the facility leased to  Klinlab that the bank of "completely common viruses" was located  that was destroyed on Defense Minister Baudys' order under  extraordinary security measures.    First, already in 1992, expensive foreign-made equipment was  bought for the Central Military Health Institution -- a  laboratory glass washer, for instance, or an automatic analyzer  -- just to guarantee a good future for the Central Military  Hospital [UVN]. The purchases were made by the deputy chief of  the Central Military Health Institution (UVZU), Dr. Moravek.  The justification was that the UVZU would produce and market  hygienically pure water for commercial purposes. Shortly  thereafter, however, a questionnaire was circulated among the  employees of this institution recruiting "experts" for the  future private laboratory institute called Klinlab. The  questionnaire was then used to justify (the people want it) the  establishment of Klinlab. This company assumed, however, only  the profit-making or profit promising part of the UVZU. Under  the auspices of Economics Deputy Minister Kalousek, the company  was authorized to manage the six-floor facility in the UVN by a  contract dated 10 September 1993 and signed with the Army for  Klinlab by no one else but Dr. Moravek, still an officer on  active duty. He signed as the executive secretary of a company  that had not yet been founded, much less registered.    This violates a good number of laws and regulations --  including the defense minister's order No. 9 of 11 February 1993.    Only a month after the signing of the lease (which leaves  the  owner with the obligations of the owner, including construction  alterations), on 11 October 1993, the Klinlab company contract  was signed, and only on 23 October 1993 is Klinlab entered on  the company register.    In a state governed by rule of law, the contract would  certainly be invalid. In a state governed by rule of law, the  people signing such contracts would be considered cheats.  Furthermore, Dr. Moravek and all the other officers from the  Klinlab Ltd. who signed the contract brazenly violated Law  143/1992 in its Article 3, Section 4 of the government  instruction, according to which they are paid their salary with  a 25 percent bonus provided they do not engage in business but  only serve in the Army!    The Klinlab lease contract (let us assume that the same  ministerial office is responsible for its organization, which  refused other privatization projects, including one from Canada)  rents the relevant part of the UVN for 720,123 korunas annually  to the, of course, not yet existing legal entity, and the money  was then lent to them interest-free for a fixed term, i.e.,  until the purchase contract is signed. All that happens on 1  December 1993. Material and supplies worth dozens of millions is  passed onto Klinlab without inventory, and when an inventory is  taken of the furniture and equipment, it is calculated at  write-off prices. Regarding the laboratory equipment valued at  approximately 30 million korunas, then, Klinlab chooses what it  needs and purchases (until the date of the purchase contract it  will use it free of charge) the equipment at a later date.    So, this is the expedient lie about Engineer Kalousek of  which we are guilty.    The military equipment that was profitable for the Army,  including the equipment purchased for taxpayer's money, will  pass into private hands. The money-losing equipment will be  kept by the Army.    Of course, some soldiers wanted to object. That was an ill-  advised idea. After all, the appropriate commission  investigated it. Even Colonel Krizenecky put his iron in the  fire, and so did Military Prosecutor Dr. Novak. The same one  who was investigating but never concluded the investigation of  the activities of another man of the Kalousek-type at the  Defense Ministry, the current director of the Nase Vojsko [Our  Army] publishing house, Jakub Cisar -- of course, that was still  in the Orbis publishing house.    We will reach the stage of socialism in our country, we will  be successful in defending the peace, and we will thwart the  iniquitous activities of traitors, and so on along the arduous  path towards a better tomorrow. The officers will get paid (by  us, friends) for not engaging in business. They conduct  business (with our money). Are we to believe that the sale of  microbes, eventually to be thrown into a synagogue as an  example, presents a problem for such enterprising entrepreneurs?</p>

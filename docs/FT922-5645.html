			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee delegates under pressure THE PRESSURE on coffee producers to come up with firm proposals for measures to support world prices mounted yesterday as the markets retreated in both London and New York. The producers, who today end a three-day meeting at the London headquarters of the International Coffee Organisation, have been widely expected to reach agreement on a course of action that could be put before consumers at a full meeting of the ICO at the end of next month. Yesterday analysts felt that a consensus would be reached, but that it would be couched in vague terms. Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with GNI, the London futures brokers, said that the producers would have to come up with concrete proposals to stop the markets turning bearish again. Mr Peter Kettle, of ED &amp; F. Man, said the producers needed to have specific figures to put before the consumers. London's July robusta contract closed at Dollars 725 a tonne, down Dollars 10, while New York's nearby arabica contract was off more than 1 cent at 62.90 cents a lb by midday on trade selling. However, trading was thin as most of the cash markets in Europe were closed for the Ascension Day holiday. Brazil and Colombia, the two biggest producers, last week moved a lot closer in attitude towards the coffee agreement. However, the National Coffee Association of the US, the biggest consumer, last week reiterated its strong support for a continued free market.</p>

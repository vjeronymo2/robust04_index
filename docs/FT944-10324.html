			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Sutherland warns of US 'mortal blow' - Failure to ratify Uruguay Round could put trading system in jeopardy Failure by the US to ratify the Uruguay Round global trade accords this year would deal a 'mortal blow' to the international trading system, Mr Peter Sutherland, the director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, said yesterday. Speaking at the launch of a Gatt study which shows an annual Dollars 510bn potential income boost to the world economy from the Uruguay Round, Mr Sutherland said postponement of the US decision was not an option. World leaders had committed themselves to bringing the round, and the World Trade Organisation, Gatt's successor, into force next January. Failure to do so could destroy the results of eight years of negotiations. 'It would be inconceivable that a country that has so much to gain from the Uruguay Round could strike a mortal blow to the system by putting off the debate,' he said. The Gatt report says trade liberalisation in goods alone could add over Dollars 120bn a year to US national income by 2005, more than a fifth of the total. US 'fast-track' authority, under which Congress votes on the Uruguay Round implementing legislation without amendment, is due to expire at the end of this year. Without this authority legislators could pick the accord to pieces, effectively killing it. The Gatt chief said it was very difficult to see the WTO coming into existence without the US, which was most countries' biggest trading partner. The consequences of a failure to ratify on time by any of the leading traders would be 'extremely serious and very, very dangerous for the world economy'. Not only would the world lose the benefits of the Uruguay Round. The effect would be ultimately to destroy the trading system built up so painstakingly since the last war. 'The whole multilateral system would be extremely seriously - mortally, I would say - damaged,' he said. The world income gain from Uruguay Round liberalisation of trade in goods shown in the latest Gatt report is twice the annual Dollars 235bn estimated earlier this year. Gatt's new economic model tries to capture the effects of increased competition in domestic markets, scale economies from expanded world markets and the 'dynamic' impact of higher income on savings and investment. Of the extra global income of Dollars 510bn a year under Gatt's 'most plausible' set of estimates, nearly two-thirds results from reductions in non-tariff barriers. Of these, the most important is the phase-out of the Multi-Fibre Arrangement governing trade in textiles and clothing, which could greatly reduce prices for consumers in the US and Europe and treble world exports. Cuts in industrial tariffs contribute about a quarter of the gains, partly through price cuts in domestic markets and partly through increased exports. Reductions in farm trade barriers account for about 10 per cent. On a country basis, the US is the biggest single beneficiary, reaping an income gain of Dollars 122bn a year by 2005, while the European Union benefits by over Dollars 163bn a year. In both cases, the bulk of the gains come from lowering non-tariff barriers, especially scrapping MFA restrictions and, in the EU's case, ending curbs on car imports from Japan. Japan will have an income boost of Dollars 27bn a year, the smaller figure in part reflecting its already low industrial tariffs and absence of MFA restrictions. Developing and transition economics, excluding China and Taiwan, gain Dollars 116bn a year. China could benefit to the tune of nearly Dollars 20bn a year and Taiwan by over Dollars 10bn. The report stresses that even its new estimates are likely to understate substantially the benefits of the Uruguay Round because they do not take account of liberalisation in trade in services, and the impact of strengthened trade rules and dispute settlement procedures.

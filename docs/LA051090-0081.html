			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> BUILDER FACES NEW DELAY IN OXNARD DEVELOPMENT  </P> <P> A developer who has waited more than four years for the Oxnard City Council to  decide whether to approve a 77-acre development on the northeast corner of  Oxnard Boulevard and Gonzales Road will just have to wait a little longer.  </P> <P> After three hours of debate, the City Council voted 3 to 2 late Tuesday to  amend the General Plan and approve the Warmington Homes project, which would  include 132 single-family houses, 154 condominiums and a 4 1/2-acre office  complex.  </P> <P> However, the council then referred the proposal to the Planning Commission for  further review and for approval of a zone change and a special use permit. The  move will delay a final decision by the council on the project until late  summer, city officials said.  </P> <P> Mayor Nao Takasugi and council members Dorothy Maron and Manuel Lopez supported  the project, while council members Ann Johs and Geraldine (Gerry) Furr opposed  it.  </P> <P> Johs and Furr said they voted against the project because they believe that the  office complex would create too much traffic for the neighborhood. Johs also  said she opposed the project because she believes that Oxnard should first  adopt its new General Plan, which it is scheduled to do next month.  </P> <P> Last month, the council was prepared to make a final decision on the project.  But after residents near the site objected to a 51,275-square-foot retail  center, the developer asked the council to delay a decision to consider two  alternatives.  </P> <P> Hardy Strozier, a consultant for Warmington Homes of Agoura Hills, asked the  council to consider substituting a 4 1/2-acre office building complex or 54  additional condominium units.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the council supported replacing the retail center with an office  complex. However, because the project has been substantially altered, it  requires further review by the Planning Commission.  </P> <P> Although representatives of the developer have been discussing the project with  neighbors for 4 1/2 years, it continued Tuesday to be harshly criticized by  residents.  </P> <P> "We do not need another housing project in Oxnard at this time," said Scott  Weiss, chairman of Citizens to Protect Oxnard, a grass-roots, slow-growth  organization. "Despite what you have been told about supply and demand, this  proposal will not make housing in Oxnard affordable."  </P> <P> Elenor Branthoover, chairwoman of the Rio Lindo Neighborhood Council, which has  criticized the project, asked the council to delay a decision until the city  resolves allegations that planning officials gave it preferential treatment.  The allegations, which were raised in a local newspaper, have tainted the  project, she said.  </P> <P> The council Tuesday did not address the allegations.  </P> <P> In an interview Wednesday, City Manager David Mora dismissed the allegations,  noting that the project has been "in the hopper for 4 1/2 years."  </P> <P> However, he said he sent a memo to Community Development Director Richard  Maggio last year asking that the project not be delayed. Mora said he did so  because the project had been delayed for years and he was worried that waiting  for approval of the new General Plan would delay it further.  </P> <P> Last month, the project's retail center was criticized by members of the Rio  Lindo Neighborhood Council. Members of the group said they feared that it would  increase traffic congestion.  </P> <P> Strozier said that by replacing the retail center with offices, the number of  traffic trips to and from the site would drop to about 6,000 a day from about  8,000. The number of trips would drop to about 4,000 a day if the retail center  is replaced with residential units, he said.  </P> <P> In response to the group's concerns, the developer has agreed to ban gas  stations, fast-food restaurants, convenience stores, video arcades and liquor  stores from the site.  </P></p>

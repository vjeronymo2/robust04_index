			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Swiss resignation Mr Rene Felber, Switzerland's foreign minister, yesterday resigned, five weeks after his government's campaign to take the country into the European Economic Area (EEA) was rejected in a referendum, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich. Mr Felber, who was treated for cancer last summer, said he was resigning because of his illness. He has been a fervent promoter of closer ties with the European Community. His successor is likely to be a member of the Democratic Socialist party and a francophone.</p>

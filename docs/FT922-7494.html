			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Three groups seek combat radio deal THREE CONSORTIA have entered bids for a UK combat radio project expected to be worth between Pounds 1bn and Pounds 2bn. The project, called Bowman, is to replace British forces' Clansman system at about the turn of the century. Bidding for the contract, which will pit British, US and French VHF radio systems against each other, closes today. Siemens Plessey Defence Systems, a UK subsidiary of the German Siemens group, yesterday submitted a joint bid with Racal Electronics for a new family of radios derived from Racal's successful Jaguar system. Racal won a Pounds 70m Canadian contract for enhanced Jaguar radios last October. The two companies produced most of the communications equipment for Clansman, which has been in service since the late 1970s. GEC-Marconi, defence arm of the General Electric Company, is competing jointly with Thomson-CSF of France, offering the new 'fourth generation' PR4G tactical radios that Thomson is producing for the French Army. Thomson recently won a Dutch order in competition against the US Sincgars, made by ITT. ITT is entering its Sincgars for the UK competition, acting as prime contractor in a consortium with British Aerospace. Harris of the US is participating as a sub-contractor. SEL of Germany, part of the French Alcatel group, was also invited to tender for the contract last October. Two of the contenders are expected to be selected next year for a demonstration phase, with a production contract for the winner of the run-off awarded probably in 1996. The Ministry of Defence has insisted on using proven technology in order to save on development costs. Production is expected to involve up to 60,000 radio sets, with some items due in service before the end of the decade. The project is aimed at providing much greater capacity for secure transmission of data at the same time as voice communications, and will include ultra-high frequency ground-to-air radios.</p>

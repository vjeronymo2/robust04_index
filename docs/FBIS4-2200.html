			<p>BFN     [Text] Urumqi, April 7 (XINHUA) -- The Turpan-Hami oilfield  in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region will be  able to pump 24.5 million bbl (over three million tons) of crude  oil annually by the end of 1995, according to an oilfield  official.    Located in the 48,000 sq km Turpan-Hami basin, the oilfield  is currently capable of producing 1.58 million tons a year, the  official said, adding that it pumped 1.15 million tons in 1993.    The recoverable oil reserves of the oilfield are estimated  at  1.6 billion tons, and its natural gas reserves at 365 billion cu  m [cubic meters].    Drilling of the oilfield began three years ago.

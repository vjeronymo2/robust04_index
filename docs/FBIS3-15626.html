			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Audrius Baciulis: "Diplomatic Masterpieces"] </F>   [Text] The press used to report extensively on our Foreign  Minister P. Gylys' diplomatic "skills" at one time. He did not  escape the attention of the Seimas [parliament] as well.  Although the minister remained in office, he stated arrogantly  as usual that the operation "fall" [opposition's no-confidence  vote] directed against him had failed, and that he had to  withdraw from active political life. Judging by certain signs,  the key workload has been transferred to Deputy Minister A.  Januska, while the minister has confined himself to protocol  visits. (For example, he is planning to go to a conference of  European Union associate members, although it is not yet clear  what he intends to do there -- probably, to show himself and  look at others.)    However, only the minister himself can perform certain  diplomatic functions. For example, to convey a protest to an  ambassador of a neighboring country, particularly if one of its  trains, loaded with enough armored vehicles to accommodate a  battalion, crosses the Lithuanian border. Not only did Russia  fail to inform anyone of such a military transit, but the  vehicles (this time empty) were accompanied by armed Russian  soldiers.    Under normal diplomatic circumstances such actions are  called  armed provocations. Upon learning such facts, the government  immediately summons the ambassador of the provocating state to  the Foreign Ministry and expresses a harsh protest, regardless  of the time of day or night.    How did the Lithuanian foreign minister behave under such  circumstances? The train with armored vehicles crossed the  Lithuanian border on Saturday [19 February]. The Foreign  Ministry managed to summon the Russian ambassador only on  Tuesday. Instead of expressing a harsh protest, P. Gylys  requested (!) that Russia observe the rules of transit in the  future. According to our foreign minister, this Russian  provocation was only an "unpleasant incident." The minister  even managed to find some "positive tendencies" -- it turns out  that servicemen are leaving Kaliningrad Oblast rather than  entering it, as though there was a shortage of soldiers in  Uznemune [reference to Lithuanian territory lying between the  Nemunas river and Kaliningrad Oblast].    One may only guess what P. Gylys lacked on Tuesday -- the  courage to lodge a protest with Russia or a simple knowledge of  diplomatic rules. The minister may have simply forgotten how  the chief diplomat of an independent state should behave in such  cases....</p>

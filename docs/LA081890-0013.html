			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FORCES BEHIND IMMIGRATION  </P> <P> In response to "Powerful Economic Forces Behind Illegal Immigration"  (editorial, Aug. 6):  </P> <P> How wonderful to read of a government commission reaching practical and  realistic conclusions. The Times' editorial and July 29 article (Opinion) by  Diego C. Asencio and state Sen. Art Torres of the Commission for the Study of  International Migration and Cooperative Economic Development get to the crux of  massive migration -- jobs.  </P> <P> When immigrants both legal and illegal leave homes in pleasant, uncrowded  places to live three families in a decaying apartment there's got to be a  reason. They are not here for the climate or the tourist attractions.  </P> <P> As hard-working and charming as most of these people are, cities like Los  Angeles are at the breaking point of absorption, with daily headlines citing  lack of funds for hospitals, freeways and schools.  </P> <P> Now the news of our declining prosperity bodes even more trouble. Historically,  Americans do not welcome immigrants when times are bad. They may be out of work  themselves. There could be some ugly scenes in large cities.  </P> <P> Thanks to this commission for finally telling it as it is -- no quick answer.  Excess immigration is a very serious problem for native and newcomer alike, as  well as the country losing its best and brightest.  </P> <P> MARY MEYER  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

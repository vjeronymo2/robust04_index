			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Cairo, 14 May (MENA)--An official security  source at the Interior Ministry today announced that the  security forces raided 11 hideouts at the same time in the  Governorates of Cairo, al-Jizah, Ismailia, al-Daqahliyah, and  al-Qalyubiyah arresting the associates of terrorist Tal'at Yasin  Hammam, the leader of the terrorist groups. They represent the  command group, which includes the base of the organization's  military wing in the central region, and the officials in charge  of surveillance, finance, liaison, and implementation.    In the security campaigns, seven modern vehicles of various  types were seized. One of those cars was used in the  assassination of martyr Major General Ra'uf Khayrat in al-Haram  on 9 April and another in the attack against the officers of Abu  Za'bal prison on 26 March, when explosive charges were thrown at  them on the Cairo- Ismailia agricultural road.    When residences of members of the command and implementation  groups were searched, large amounts of explosive, chemical, and  incendiary materials were found along with some sketches and  information about officials on the assassination list and some  cash. [passage omitted]    The source said that in light of information gathered from  close surveillance of some terrorists abroad and their contacts  inside the country, the State Security Intelligence managed to  define the general picture of the terrorists' activity and of  certain internal organizations trying to support those  terrorists and push them to implement their various operations.  [passage omitted]    The security forces extended the arrest operations to  include  those responsible for liaison and conveying assignments from the  leaders of the organization inside prisons to leaders outside.  It became certain that this liaison mission was carried out by  two lawyers who used their profession to serve their secret  organizational activities. One of these is lawyer  'Abd-al-Harith Muhammad Ibrahim Madani, who was arrested and  accused in connection with several extremist cases in Isna in  the Governorate of Qina. Investigations and seized  organizational documents proved that he was also in charge of  financing the organization from funds he received from the  leader of these groups, Tal'at Muhammad Yasin Hammam.    The source said the suspect distributed sums amounting to  45,000 Egyptian pounds and $3,000.    The security source pointed out that this suspect is one of  the dangerous terrorist elements that played a prominent role in  the recent terrorist acts. He was arrested on 3 July 1990 for  his dangerous activity in the terrorist groups, and in the same  year he, along with others, were charged with attacking citizens  in Isna and preventing them from visiting cemeteries. He was  also accused in Case No. 4116 in 1991 in Isna, when he was  arrested for distributing leaflets promoting extremist thought  and inciting violence.    The source said the High State Security Prosecution issued a  warrant for his arrest for his involvement in Case No. 235 of  1994-high state security, concerning the military wing of the  terrorist groups organization, which is currently being examined.    The security source said that the defendants told State  Security Prosecution investigators that Madani was their link to  the group's leader, Hammam. Madani was also in charge of  communication between the group's imprisoned and free leaders, a  task he performed under cover of his work as a lawyer and on the  orders of Hammam.    The source said that the defendants' confessions also show  that Madani was in charge of the finances of the group.  Investigators have learned of seven instances in which Madani  received funds from abroad totalling 45,000 Egyptian pounds and  $3,000. The entire sum was used to finance the group's  terrorist activities.    Security forces arrested Madani on the night of 26 April at  his office in al-Haram, the source said. They took him along as  they searched his home in al-Talibiyah in al-Haram. There  security sources seized documents and other material. While the  security forces were leading Madani to his second residence in  Warraq al-'Arab, which they intended to search, he experienced  difficulty in breathing and lost consciousness. He was  instantly taken to the al-Manyal al-Jami'i hospital for  treatment, where doctors diagnosed his case as severe asthma and  kept him in the hospital for treatment. The next day, 27 April,  the hospital notified us that the defendant had died of lung  failure, a complication of severe asthma, the source said.    The security source added that the State Security  Intelligence forces continued to act on the information they had  already gathered. Acting in cooperation with other security  organs, they prepared plans to raid 25 hideouts of the military  wing of the extremist terrorist groups in farm and mountain  areas in the Asyut and Suhaj Governorates.    In these hideouts, the security forces seized four automatic  weapons, a pistol, 1,600 7.62-mm rounds, 300 9-mm rounds, 18 kg  of TNT, 29 detonators, six timers, and electric wiring devices.  The raids also led to the arrest of the deputy leader of the  military wing of the terrorist groups in south Egypt. The  officials in charge of communications and accommodations were  also arrested. So was a group of terrorists wanted by police in  connection with 40 terrorist attacks against police officials,  trains, and Nile cruise boats in south Egypt. The defendants  have been referred to the competent prosecution offices.    The individuals who were arrested in these raids confessed  to  involvement in the assassination of Asyut Security Commander  Brigadier General Shirin 'Ali Fahmi; and Lieutenant Colonel  Mustafa Khalil Tuni and First Lieutenant Zaki Bahjat, both of  the Asyut Security Department. They also admitted involvement  in the attack on Bank Abu-Tij in Asyut and the bombing in  al-Bunuk Square in Asyut, according to the Interior Ministry  source.    The security source noted that as a result of these security  operations against the leaders, cadres, and members of the  terrorist elements, 98 leading figures have been arrested and  approximately 500,000 Egyptian pounds have been seized. In  addition, a Goryunov machine gun, five automatic weapons, three  pistols, three Enfield automatic rifles, a Russian-made pistol,  25 FON [initials as received] bombs, a large quantity of live  ammunition, 190 kg of highly explosive TNT, a large quantity of  chemicals, ready-made explosive devices and tools and material  for making them, fax machines, and wireless telephones have been  seized. [passage omitted]    The source noted that investigations and surveillance  operations are still underway to arrest the remaining terrorists  still at large, who include the following important figures:  Hasan Salih Hasan Mahmud, Hasan al-Sayyid Hamid Khayri, Mahmud  Muhammad Sa'id Salim, Jamal 'Abd-al- Hamid 'Abd-al-Nasir,  Hamadah Muhammad Lutfi 'Abd-al-Baqi, Rif'at Zaydan 'Abdallah,  Islam Ahmad Muhammad Ibrahim al-Ghamri. In addition, there are  other terrorist elements whose activities are being monitored  abroad. [passage omitted]</p>

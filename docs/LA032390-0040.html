			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTERNATIONAL TRAVELOGUE OF CLUB STYLE;  </P> <P> L.A. WEARS HEAVY-METAL UNIFORM  </P> <P> Los Angeles is an industry town like any other -- except that the biz here is  the fast and eccentric entertainment trade. Clubs like Bordello cater to the  rock 'n' roll hordes: youthful urbanites clad in leather, denim and fringe.  </P> <P> Young women wear tattoos and dresses that are short, tight and leave nothing to  the imagination. Some clubs, like Club With No Name and Scarlet Letter, add a  twist -- the former caters to the black-clad underground crowd while the latter  features Harleys as fashion accessories.  </P> <P> While the rockers take their looks from metal-music icons such as Axl Rose,  other club-goers look to fashion plates in magazines. At Club Louis, once  Madonna's Friday-night choice for dancing, pricey blouses, coats and shirts hit  the floor as the crowd works up a dance sweat. For those more inclined to drink  than dance, there's Small's, a cozy bar on the wrong end of Melrose (that's  east) where night owls wear what they will and it's too dark to see anyway.

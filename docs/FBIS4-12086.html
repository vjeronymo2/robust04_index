			<p>BFN     [Text] Minister of State 'Ali 'Usayran has said the  government will soon issue a law organizing the audio and visual  media and will refer it to the Chamber of Deputies for  ratification or amendment.    Speaking at his home in al-Rumaylah today, 'Usayran affirmed  that the Chamber of Deputies is the defender of liberties. He  added that the purpose of a media law is to organize the  dissemination of political information, not to suppress  liberties, especially as such suppression is a fruitless  activity in Lebanon.    He pointed out that during the civil war the militias  attempted to dictate their wishes to local communities. He  explained that all those who lived through that period know that  the silent majority in Lebanon opposed and still opposes any  attempt to suppress liberties.</p>

			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Hungary is model in mobile phone scramble for E Europe - Prospects for western companies in a region where the phones don't work MANY western investors have gone cool on an eastern Europe mired in recession. But not the US and European telecommunications companies that campaigned for two concessions to operate digital mobile communications which Hungary awarded at the end of last month. A group led by regional Bell operator US West and another of national telecoms companies from the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Finland won the tenders over DBFH Consortium, a coalition of Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom and British Telecom. Bids surpassed expectations: the two successful consortia offered nearly Dollars 100m (Pounds 66m) between them for the rights to operate eastern Europe's first wireless services based on the pan-European GSM digital standard for the next generation of cellular phone networks. On top of the concession fee, the winning contenders committed themselves to network development which could cost Dollars 400m over 10 years. International interest in Hungary's GSM tender has been feverish, partly because Hungary is widely regarded as the 'model' for the rest of eastern Europe. US West has been particularly active, recently winning tenders to develop digital mobile networks in 10 Russian cities. The company also has stakes in existing analogue mobile concessions in east-central Europe. It partners Hungarian Telecommunications Company in the Westel joint venture in Hungary and has teamed up with US counterpart Bell Atlantic and local operators in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. In Poland, Ameritech of the US, France Telecom and local partners have invested Dollars 120m in their Centertel joint venture. Meanwhile, various Scandinavian operators are embarking on wireless communications development in the Baltic republics. Further south in the former Soviet Union, Deutsche Telekom, Telecom Denmark and PTT Netherlands have combined to provide mobile phones in 21 Ukrainian cities. The rash of deals in eastern Europe owes something to the worldwide fashion for cellular communications. Greece set a new benchmark for emerging markets by selling off two GSM digital concessions last year for a total of Dollars 320m. Eastern Europe has particular strategic value for some companies. US West, for instance, hopes that its growing presence will allow 'backdoor' access to European Community markets as the two halves of the continent come closer. And a representative of the 'Nordic' operators which campaigned so vigorously for the Hungarian GSM concession says that the area is 'strategically vital' if they are not to be cordoned off in home markets. Another draw is that east European governments are moving towards liberal telecommunications regimes to attract finance from abroad. They have little alternative. Improvement of telecommunications is a priority and budget deficits preclude extra government spending. The decisive enticement, however, has been the spark-ling initial performance of the east European market for mobile communications, which has shrugged off the region's general recession. Take Hungary. When Westel, US West's existing Hungarian joint venture, began providing an analogue mobile service three years ago, customers queued up outside its offices. Penetration has been much more rapid than in the west. Westel has 33,000 subscribers and expects to have 40,000 by the time the company's investment of Dollars 85m brings nationwide coverage at the end of the year. Hungarian subscribers, moreover, spend nearly three times as much time on their mobile phones than the average user in western Europe, despite stiffer charges. No wonder rivals describe Hungary as 'the jewel in the crown' of US West's east European operations. Hungary's new breed of entrepreneurs, temperamentally status-conscious, are particularly avid mobile phone users. 'Maybe it is to do with the Hungarian nature: they are the traders of central Europe,' says Mr Richard Spandler, head of international mobile services for Telecom Denmark. But Hungary's neighbours are no cellular slouches. US West's Czech and Slovak ventures have about 10,000 subscribers, for instance, and they are also heavy users. Poland's Centertel expects 20,000 customers by the end of this year. Common to the region is the inadequacy of the standard telephone network. Waiting lists attest to suppressed demand for telephones in the region, which programmes for investment in landlines will take years to satisfy. Survey evidence from Hungary is that half of subscribers to existing analogue mobile services have no access to a standard telephone line. They are the only communications option for many businesspeople. Short of getting into a car, that is.  -------------------------------------------------------------- EAST EUROPEAN CELLULAR TELEPHONE SUBSCRIBERS (January '93)  -------------------------------------------------------------- Country                        Subscribers    Penetration*  -------------------------------------------------------------- Czech/Slovakia                       6,188           0.29 Croatia                              6,000           1.28 Estonia                              2,400           2.59 Hungary                             22,010           2.08 Latvia                               1,200           0.37 Lithuania                              267           0.08 Poland                               3,000           0.08 Russia Moscow                        2,415           0.24 Russia St Petersburg                 1,057           0.21 Slovenia                             4,000           2.00 Total                               48,537           0.52 Total W European**               5,985,146          16.25  -------------------------------------------------------------- *Per 1,000 of population. **As at March 1; figures for analogue networks.  -------------------------------------------------------------- Source: FT Mobile Communications Newsletter  --------------------------------------------------------------</p>

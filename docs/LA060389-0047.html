			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> S. AFRICA HANGINGS PROMPT NEW DEATH PENALTY OUTCRY  </P> <P> Four people, including a 22-year-old woman, were hanged in South Africa on  Friday, provoking fresh calls from church and civil rights groups for an end to  the death penalty.  </P> <P> A Justice Ministry spokesman said that the four, all convicted murderers, were  sent to the gallows inside Pretoria Central Prison at dawn.  </P> <P> It was the first execution of a woman in more than two years in South Africa,  which the London-based human rights organization Amnesty International says has  the world's third-highest official execution rate after Iran and Iraq.  </P> <P> Three more prisoners at Pretoria -- the site of South Africa's only gallows --  have been told they will hang next week. This will bring the number of  executions so far this year to 33, according to Lawyers for Human Rights.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the lawyers, a Pretoria-based civil rights group, said they  were puzzled about the recent surge in executions at a time when a national  anti-hanging lobby is gaining strength. "People are being notified of their  executions at an unprecedented rate. It is a tragic trend," he said.  </P> <P> "But support for our work is gaining all the time. We hope to succeed soon in  convincing the government that capital punishment is barbaric." he added.  </P> <P> Apart from the first two months of this year, when there were only two  hangings, the execution rate for 1989 is now close to the average of 10 a month  that has been maintained for most of the decade, according to the lawyers  group.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a bomb damaged the home of a top South African Indian politician  Friday morning as his three sons and 80-year-old mother slept inside, but no  one was injured.  </P> <P> Boetie Abrahamjee, chairman of the Indian house of delegates in South Africa's  segregated three-chamber Parliament, was visiting Britain at the time of the  explosion.  </P> <P> Police said the explosion was caused by a limpet mine planted about 20 yards  from the security wall of the house in an Indian suburb outside Pretoria.  </P> <P> The attack on Abrahamjee's house was the second within a month on the home of a  politician. On May 7 a bomb damaged the home of a white member of Parliament in  Krugersdorp.  </P></p>

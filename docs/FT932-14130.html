			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (17): It's not such a simple issue - . . . For Piracy ONE of the fundamental problems with software piracy is that most 'pirates' never realise that this is what they are. It is part of the nature of software that a program can be copied by one individual, passed on to another, and the first person still retains their original copy - so how can it be pirating, for nothing has gone missing? It is, of course, not theft but breach of copyright and is now treated in law in broadly the same way as breaches of other copyright in areas such as writing and music. But while most people are well aware that, if they photocopy a book or tape a piece of music they are breaching copyright, when it comes to computer software this does not always register. Why? Partly it is the industry's own fault. The PC industry in particular has tended to use a marketing theme along the lines of 'all this technology for next to no cost.' It is but a short step for many to assume that software is 'free.' The industry has also often made its licencing so complicated, particularly where multiple copies might be required by the user, that copying is simply the easier option. The other main reason, as implied by recent survey figures from FAST, the Federation Against Software Theft, is that most 'pirates' simply do not realise that they have actually carried out the act of piracy. FAST is made up of around 150 of the leading software suppliers, plus a growing number of corporate users. The FAST survey has shown that the majority of offenders are what it defines as ordinary users, often people using computers for work and passing round within their company applications that are relevant to their tasks. Interestingly, the next biggest group of offenders are those that really should know better, company MIS managers with a tendency to be what FAST ironically calls 'budget-conscious.' Despite appearances in the press, unscrupulous resellers, students and dedicated computer hackers in practice account for less than a quarter of all offenders. FAST is still more than interested in the activities of such people, and has recently launched a big crackdown on market and car-boot sale traders who sell copied applications quite openly. The survey has indicated, however, that while it should not lose sight of those targets, a shift in focus is now needed. In short, the corporate users who do not realise they are doing anything illegal have now become FAST's prime target. A corporate membership scheme was launched last year and to date FAST has dealt with some 4,000 enquiries. Two hundred of these have already resulted in the applicants becoming corporate members of FAST. One of the claimed advantages of corporate membership is that the software industry members at last get a method of directly hearing corporate users' problems with such important factors as licencing agreements and documentation. Both of these, and in particular the complexity of licencing applications for use across multiple users on a network, are cited as reasons why corporate users sometimes end up acting illegally. It also has side benefits for the corporate users themselves. Not only do they learn how not to act illegally, they also gain more control over what applications are running on their networks. AUDIT SYSTEM Part of being a corporate member of FAST is to run a software audit, discovering what applications are being used on the systems. This not only identifies potential illegalities, but also allows the company's MIS department to identify problem applications, usually unapproved packages which have the potential to clash with either other applications or, more significantly, the network management system itself. This is certainly seen as a benefit by one of the recent additions to FAST corporate members, Morgan Grenfell. The company also faced the problem that, as its traders could not afford to be off-line while audits of their individual systems were undertaken, it has had to utilise an on-line audit system running on the network. M-G sees some big benefits in this approach. Not only are the traders minimally disrupted, for the audit is run over the network rather than their individual computers being taken off-line, but once completed, the company can then institute a continuous review process running automatically in the background. The company's Quality Management Group can also identify those applications which, while perhaps not acquired through piracy (for example public domain applications) are nonetheless not approved for use on the network. According to the company's IT Quality Manager, Mike Marjot, this aspect of network integrity and applications quality was the prime reason for the exercise. Identifying illegally copied applications was, in a way, a very useful by-product. Given this perspective, the Quality Management Group decided they would tell the traders and other users that the audit was taking place, and specifically stressed that this was not being done to 'catch' anyone acting illegally. Needless to say, that would have also been a very useful by-product, particularly in advance of any unannounced visit from those nice people from FAST.</p>

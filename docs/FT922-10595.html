			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Survey of Relocation in The UK (1): The pattern has changed  -Although business is still brisk for the relocation industry in the UK, there are also signs that the pace of company moves is beginning to slow down, as the recession takes its toll BUSINESS appears to be booming in the relocation industry, with 1991 marking a new peak in moves out of central London. Yet a downturn in activity now seems inevitable over the next few years, as the recession takes its toll. A recent survey by estate agents Jones Lang Wootton demonstrates the changing circumstances graphically. Last year saw 36 organisations and companies moving almost 14,000 employees out of the centre of London - the highest level recorded since monitoring began in 1964. But the survey also found that the number of moves in the pipeline was falling. Only 14 organisations had announced a decision to relocate in 1991, compared with 36 such announcements in 1990 and 42 in 1989. At the time the survey was completed, only 25 moves were scheduled for 1992 and just two for 1993. The period of growth in relocation away from the capital appears to be grinding to a halt. The fact that relocation activity continued to grow until quite recently despite the recession reflects the delays inherent in the process of moving companies. 'Any company moving out of the south-east over the past three years probably took the decision some time in the mid-1980s,' says Susan Dugdale of Black Horse Relocation, the UK's largest relocation agency. 'That sort of planning has been less common over the past two years, and the pace of moves is therefore likely to slow down during the next few years.' Certainly the recession has eased some of the pressures which encouraged relocation moves. With unemployment rates rising faster in London and the south-east than in the rest of the UK, recruitment in and around the capital is no longer the nightmare that it was in the overheated 1980s. Staff turnover, which often prompted employers to relocate to regions where they could expect greater stability, is down as the jobs market freezes up. And with millions of square feet of office space lying empty in London, it is a buyers' market for companies looking to relocate within the capital. Labour costs remain higher in the south-east: allowances paid to employees working in central London have not fallen in the recession and can exceed Pounds 3,000 a year. And other overheads such as rates and transport costs can be higher. But the economic case for relocation  - in the short-term at any rate - is now less clear cut. However, the attractions of relocation are almost certain to re-assert themselves once the green shoots of economic recovery break through. The old problems of high rents, shortage of skilled employees, costly staff turnover and the overheads imposed on working in the overcrowded and congested south-east will soon emerge again. And technological developments continue to offer considerable opportunities for service organisations to follow the example of the banks and insurance companies in moving back offices to lower-cost areas while maintaining a shop window in London and the south-east. Even local government can take advantage of these opportunities, as the experience of Windsor and Maidenhead district council shows. Finding itself competing for computer staff with the salaries offered by high-tech companies in the M4 corridor, the council in 1988 relocated its computing development centre to Telford in Shropshire. The centre maintains direct communications links to the council's mainframe computer at the council headquarters in Maidenhead. The long-term benefits of relocation continue to be recognised by government departments and other public bodies which are largely immune to the short-term financial constraints of the recession. With 12,000 civil service jobs already moved out of London and the south-east in the last three years, another 18,000 are due to follow by mid-1994 - and a further 24,000 posts are under review for relocation. Many of these government moves are significant in scale. Customs and Excise, for example, is moving 1,250 jobs out of the south-east by relocating its VAT central unit from Southend to a brand-new building in Liverpool's docklands in 1993. With 400 other head office jobs already moved to Manchester, Customs will have moved more than 30 per cent of its headquarters staff out of the south-east. The Inland Revenue is moving many of its head office functions out London and the south-east to a purpose-built headquarters in Nottingham; 1,800 jobs will go to Nottingham, with another 400 London-based tax office staff moving to Cardiff, Bootle, Edinburgh and Glasgow. In the short-term, however, companies in the private sector struggling for survival in today's tougher business environment are less willing to incur the costs of relocation. Jean Crawford of Jones Lang Wootton estimates that moving an employee from London to the Midlands might save Pounds 9,000 a year in running costs, rent, rates and labour costs. But the bill up-front can average Pounds 14,500 per employee in the cost of visits to the new area, temporary accommodation, removal expenses and disturbance allowances. The collapse in the housing market has added to this cost still further where the company offers to provide bridging loans to employees who move with the job. Not only may many months of bridging finance be required before a house can be sold; the sale is often thousands of pounds lower after such a delay in a falling market. This has offered new opportunities to the relocation companies, according to Tad Zurlinden of the Edinburgh-based Association of Relocation Agents. Dealing with 'orphans,' the unsold houses of relocated employees, is now at least as important a part of their package as providing assistance to employees in making their moves. When the economy picks up, one question facing all those in the relocation industry is whether the traditional pattern of company moves from London and the south-east to the north and west will return. Last year's decision by Pilkington, the St Helens-based glassmaker, to move the headquarters of its core business of flat and safety glass to Brussels has sent shivers down the spines of those who hope to attract companies to areas north of Watford. For St Helens, it meant the loss of 750 much-needed jobs, but the reasons for the move were an even bigger blow to a town which has worked hard to attract business relocations. For Pilkington was finding it increasingly difficult to manage its continental factories in countries like Germany and Sweden from a peripheral location on Merseyside. While the opening of the channel tunnel in 1993 will improve communications between the UK and the rest of the EC, it could be into the next century before the British railways are properly linked into the high-speed rail network now being completed between the leading European centres. The fear is that larger companies with operations in more than one country may find it preferable to relocate to mainland Europe to be closer to their markets and local plants. Similar considerations may also be influencing the location decisions being made by investors from countries outside the European Community. While the UK clearly retains its supremacy as a destination for Japanese investors, there is some evidence that Japanese firms are now looking to make investments in other EC member-states, especially Germany. Ian Dodwell of estate agents Weatherall Green &amp; Smith has noticed a similar tendency among US companies seeking an EC base. 'I detect a much greater consciousness of the European options,' he says. 'The tendency to see the UK as the place to go is weakening and Brussels is increasingly seen as the place to be.' Those who wish to attract new businesses to their areas - whether from other parts of the UK or further afield - are going to have to work much harder over the coming years if they are to achieve success.</p>

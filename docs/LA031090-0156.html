			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JOSEPH N. BELL: SUPREME COURT RULING ON DRUG EXPERIMENTS RAISES SPECTER OF  RADIATION TESTS  </P> <P> When I last saw her almost three years ago, Pat Broudy -- a diminutive dynamo  of energy and persistence who lives in Laguna Niguel -- was on the verge of  becoming the first American citizen to successfully challenge the sovereign  immunity concept of the federal government.  </P> <P> She had filed a wrongful-death suit against the government on behalf of her  deceased husband, Marine Corps Maj. Charles Broudy, who died of lymphoma in  1977 after heavy exposure to nuclear tests in the Nevada desert as a military  observer. Although the original suit was dismissed twice in U.S. District  Court, that decision was twice overturned in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.  </P> <P> It all ended June 22, 1987, when the appeals court refused to overturn the  lower court decision the third time around. Pat Broudy was dismayed but not  defeated. Her long court battle publicized the plight of the victims of  government-induced radiation and their families. And it got the attention of  public officials who no longer ignore the activities of the National Assn. of  Radiation Survivors -- of which Broudy is an official.  </P> <P> I ran into her a few weeks ago on the UC Irvine campus. She had taken the day  off from her job as a legal secretary to help her son -- a UCI senior -- pass  out leaflets urging students to attend the upcoming appearance of Ron Kovic on  campus. She looked like an average sophomore in her blue jeans and matching  jacket, and she waved me over to her table.  </P> <P> "When my case was argued," she said, "government attorneys admitted in court  that the government knew the dangers of radiation from testing but felt it was  worth the sacrifice of a few men for the good of the country. Now I know that  this concept goes far beyond radiation. I've been digging around in a lot of  obscure government documents, and I've discovered that we carried out all sorts  of experiments on people who knew nothing about it. The whole thing is terribly  frightening."  </P> <P> She pulled out a stack of documents and began showing me what she meant. I  asked if I could take the documents with me and look them over a little more  leisurely. She agreed, and they have been sitting in a sack under my desk ever  since.  </P> <P> Then last week, The Times published a story out of Washington, D.C., on a 6-3  ruling by the Supreme Court that the government may legally force prison  inmates to take mind-altering drugs against their will. The decision written  for the majority by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy concluded: "Notwithstanding the  risks that are involved, we conclude that the inmate's interests are adequately  protected, and perhaps better served, by allowing the decision to medicate to  be made by medical professionals rather than a judge."  </P> <P> This reminded me instantly of Pat Broudy's documents, so I began reading them.  They are, indeed, frightening, enough so that Rep. Edward Markey (D-Mass.),  chairman of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee, was moved to write the  Secretary of the Department of Energy in 1986 that American scientists were led  to "mimic the kind of demented human experiments conducted by the Nazis."  </P> <P> The subcommittee's report -- aptly entitled "American Nuclear Guinea Pigs:  Three Decades of Radiation Experiments on U.S. Citizens" -- described in detail  programs in which 695 people were deliberately subjected to radiation  experiments, some designed to intentionally cause injury, performed on "captive  audiences or populations that some experimenters frighteningly perhaps might  have considered 'expendable': the elderly, prisoners, hospital patients  suffering from terminal diseases who might not have retained their full  faculties for informed consent."  </P> <P> Some of the correspondence between doctors involved in this program sounds like  a bad science fiction movie script. This was not untypical: "I am writing  concerning our experimental subject, Mr. Stephens . . . who was given the 50  micrograms two months ago. We are very much afraid that the man, due to his  illness, may sell his house and go to live at some distant point which would,  of course, put an end to our most interesting series of experiments."  </P> <P> A government document entitled "Testing and Use of Chemical and Biological  Agents by the Intelligence Community" in 1976 was even scarier. This one  detailed the story of Dr. Frank Olson, a civilian employee of the Army, who was  given 70 micrograms of LSD in a cocktail by a CIA officer when they were  drinking together -- apparently just to see what would happen. What happened  was that Olson freaked out and a week later jumped or fell to his death from a  10th-story hotel window in New York City. And the CIA, under director Richard  Helms, kept right on slipping LSD Mickey Finns in the drinks of unsuspecting  victims.  </P> <P> When the U.S. Senate subcommittee finally got wind of these activities and  aired them in hearings, its final report read, in part: "These research and  development programs to find materials which could be used to alter human  behavior . . . resulted in massive abridgements of the right of American  citizens, sometimes with tragic consequences. . . . The nature of the tests,  their scale, and the fact that they were continued for years after the danger  of surreptitious administration of LSD was known demonstrate a fundamental  disregard for the value of human life."  </P> <P> And remember, we're not talking about the Gestapo here, or the KGB. We're  talking about the good old American CIA.  </P> <P> To Pat Broudy, this knowledge added up to total frustration. She expected to  find outrage when she talked about it; instead, she got yawns. "Nobody cares,"  she says angrily. "Nobody cares at all."  </P> <P> Those who do react tell her this all happened so long ago that it scarcely  matters now. "But it does matter," she says. "I don't know that it isn't still  going on, but whether it is or not, the only way to be sure that it doesn't  happen again is for the public to express outrage."  </P> <P> She hopes that last week's Supreme Court decision allowing prison inmates to be  injected with mind-altering drugs against their will wakes some people up to  the broader implications of that decision.  </P> <P> "Think what Richard Helms could have done with that kind of legal support," she  says. "Or George Bush when he was head of the CIA."  </P></p>

			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Chilean bank debt solution proposed THE CHILEAN government has proposed a solution to the Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.66bn) subordinated debt issue which has plagued domestic banking for a decade, writes David Pilling in Santiago. Ten of Chile's commercial banks owe the central bank Dollars 3.9bn. This dates back to 1983 when the state took over their non-performing loans to prevent a collapse of the banking system. Banks have since been obliged to repurchase these debts yearly by handing over 70 per cent of their after-tax profits to the central bank. A reform bill, to be sent to Congress today or tomorrow, seeks to end the repayment period after 40 years.</p>

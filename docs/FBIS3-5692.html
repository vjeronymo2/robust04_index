			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Lightness of Prime Minister's Words Is </F> Concern"]    [Text] People who listened with high hopes to Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's administrative policy speech were  probably left disappointed. His speech was a bureaucratic  composition which served only to convince us that there is some  basis to the U.S. criticism that the Hosokawa administration is  controlled by bureaucrats. There is speculation that the prime  minister did not have enough time to prepare for his speech  because of the confusion over the cabinet reshuffle. It appears  the prime minister has given up his previous practice of using  only his own words.    Originally, the prime minister was a politician who placed  importance on speeches. In preparing for his visit to the  United States in February, he worried more about a speech to  Georgetown University than the important Japan-U.S. summit  talks. The general policy speech he delivered to the Diet in  August last year immediately after his inauguration assured us  this was the "start of a new era." His general policy speech in  September, which quoted from a German writer, bore his certain  style.    The recent speech was his first administrative effort, but  it  was not a good one and was excused by an aide with the excuse,  "the prime minister had no choice but to mention all sorts of  matters because the speech was based on the draft budget." The  general public wanted to hear something other than an  enumeration of policies prepared by bureaucrats.    The first thing they wanted to hear was the prime minister's  recognition of the economic recession and mention of what  counter measures were planned. The second thing they wanted was  an explanation of how he will rebuild relations between Japan  and the United States. They would also have wanted to hear  about his responsibility for the confusion within the ruling  coalition over the proposed national welfare tax and cabinet  reshuffle. The prime minister's speech failed to provide enough  answers to satisfy these legitimate public concerns.    As far as economic pump-priming measures are concerned, the  prime minister merely pointed out the need for "seamless fiscal  expenditure." He made no mention of the responsibility the  government had for allowing the economic recession to become  prolonged. He said the Japan-U.S. relationship "is moving to a  new level." What concerns us is the prime minister's optimistic  view of the situation, as if he had happily accepted the  breakdown of the recent Japan-U.S. summit talks.    In providing an abstract explanation of the political  confusion among the ruling coalition parties, he said only that  "these trials are only to be expected given that we have dared  to choose a new and untrodden path." The prime minister  probably wanted to say that a little confusion should be  expected. What, instead, we see in his speech is that the prime  minister has no sense of responsibility for the current  situation in which there seems to be no policy.    It seems Hosokawa has tended to speak first and think later  since the confusion over his proposal to introduce a national  welfare tax. He told reporters recently that his administrative  policy speech would be delivered on 7 March. The next day he  had to go back on that. We do not intend to support the  Nagata-cho rule [which works only in Nagata-cho where the Diet  and the LDP headquarters are located] that "the prime minister  must not speak about Diet schedules."    The prime minister sometimes has to make decisions that will  affect lives of many people. If he is careless in what he says,  it could affect Japan's credit with foreign nations.    Aides to the prime minister said: "This was the result of  having many people work out the speech, rather than leaving it  to one person." This amounts to a confession that bureaucrats  played a leading role in writing the policy speech. When  bureaucrats write a speech appealing for the need to tackle  economic and administrative reform through deregulation, as the  next big task following political reform, the words only ring  hollow.</p>

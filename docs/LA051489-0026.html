			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: POP STARS ***** GREAT BALLS OF FIRE **** KNOCKIN' ON HEAVEN'S DOOR  *** GOOD VIBRATIONS ** MAYBE BABY * AIN'T THAT A SHAME  </P> <P> LISA LISA &amp; CULT JAM "Straight to the Sky." Columbia **  </P> <P> Lisa Lisa, the high priestess of hip-hop, flounders this time. Each of her  first two albums was loaded with excellent cuts, but after two top-notch  tracks, "Little Jackie Wants to Be a Star" and "Just Git It Together," "Sky"  suffers a huge drop in quality. The Full Force production team dresses up the  so-so songs with high-tech razzle-dazzle, but can't camouflage all the  structural flaws. The  </P> <P> grooves on the dance tunes -- which make up the bulk of the album -- are  sizzling, even when the vocals and lyrics are sub-par. "Dance Forever" is an  example of a song with a superb rhythm track and not much else. And instead of  her usual emotional and conviction-filled singing, Lisa Lisa sounds shrill and  aloof most of the time, resembling a bargain-basement Diana Ross. DENNIS HUNT  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUYING RAILROAD RIGHTS-OF-WAY  </P> <P> I applaud Zane for his position of resurrecting old railroad rights-of-way to  be used for light-rail transit. There is no better time for the County  Transportation Commission to purchase these rail lines than now, especially  when Los Angeles' mounting transportation problems are so obvious.  </P> <P> Failure to buy the offered rail lines now might mean that the city would have  to purchase land in the future -- and for a much higher price. Los Angeles made  one of its biggest transportation mistakes by letting go of the Pacific  Electric Red Cars lines back in the '50s and early '60s. I hope that the County  Transportation Commission learns from the past so our transportation system  will be better in the future.  </P> <P> DAVID J. ABDO  </P> <P> West Hills  </P></p>

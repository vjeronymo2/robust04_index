			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / EC free trade with Maghreb sought THE EC should try to establish with key North African countries the same free trade and close political dialogue as it is seeking with central Europe, a senior EC official told the Twelve's foreign ministers yesterday. Mr Abel Matutes, the commissioner in charge of Mediterranean policy, said the Maghreb presented the Community with the same explosive potential on its borders as central Europe, but without the same political direction and technical skills. He called for EC free trade with Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, and a wide-ranging political dialogue which would not dodge the sensitive issue of human rights in these three Maghreb countries. The initiative, born in part out of EC problems with Morocco, was partly endorsed by ministers. But France took the lead in urging caution in moving to free trade, which could pose competitive problems for southern Europe's farming and textile sectors. Nonetheless, Mr Matutes, who will visit Morocco next week, was encouraged to develop his idea further. The Maghreb's economic and political problems, and the threat of migration they pose to the EC, have moved steadily up the Community agenda, since the Commission proposed a new Mediterranean policy in 1990. This involves Ecu4.5bn (Pounds 3.19bn) in aid and loans for 1992-96. However, none of this money has yet been spent, because of Greece's worries that much of it would go to Turkey. Ministers were yesterday unable to resolve this snag.</p>

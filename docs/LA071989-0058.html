			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> REBURIAL OF INDIAN REMAINS DEMANDED  </P> <P> Kumeyaay Indians want all Indian remains taken from the Mission San Diego de  Alcala site reburied there immediately and plans for a meeting hall on the lot  scrapped, their representatives told an attorney for the mission Tuesday.  </P> <P> The Kumeyaay presented a list of non-negotiable demands to mission attorney  Jeff Brinton in talks held at the California Indian Legal Services (CILS)  office, said Kumeyaay spokeswoman Fern Southcott. They include reburial of  truckloads of bones and artifacts now stored at Balboa Park's Museum of Man in  their original locations without further scientific study, Southcott said.  </P> <P> Should the mission reject the demands, the Kumeyaay will take legal action,  said the tribe's committee chairman, Ron Christman. "Our people are having a  hard time with (this), because 90% of them are Catholic, but it's a graveyard  we are talking about," Christman said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Security Sought  </P> <P> The Kumeyaay also asked that the mission rebury the remains according to Indian  and Catholic traditions, post around-the-clock security on the site and share  with the Kumeyaay all of its archeological data, according to Southcott.  </P> <P> Mission spokesman William Finley refused comment on the demands, but said they  would be carefully studied by mission priest Msgr. I. Brent Eagen.  </P> <P> Kumeyaay attorney Robert Shull of CILS and representatives from the Native  American Heritage Commission, the state attorney general's office, and the  Luiseno and Cupeno Indian tribes also attended the session.  </P> <P> Kumeyaay representatives said they were disappointed with the long-awaited  talks.  </P> <P> Southcott accused the diocese of making veiled threats to proceed without an  agreement and of playing for time in the negotiations. "They are waiting for  the adverse publicity they have received in the last couple of weeks to die  down," she said.  </P> <P> "We thought we kind of got a runaround," Christman said. "The person they sent  was a messenger, with no power to negotiate."  </P> <P> But Brinton said he had as much latitude to negotiate as any client would give  him.  </P> <P> "I don't know that there was anything to be disappointed about -- we haven't  yet replied to their proposal," he said. Brinton also said he would try to meet  with Eagen today to discuss the Indian demands. Brinton sought to reach a  temporary compromise on the Kumeyaay remains while the project was suspended,  Indian representatives said. Kumeyaay representatives denied his request to  fill in the site with sand, Southcott said.  </P> <P> Although Indians were meeting with church representatives in Escondido, the San  Diego City Council held a closed session of its own on the controversy. The  council will hold a public hearing Aug. 7 on the dispute, said councilwoman  Judy McCarty.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Second Closed Session  </P> <P> The second closed session by the council in as many weeks was held to determine  whether the city could challenge the diocese project in court, said Assistant  City Atty. Ron Johnson. No such action by the city is imminent, he added.  </P> <P> In other developments, the National Park Service wrote a letter to Eagen asking  him to leave the site as is and to build the meeting hall somewhere else.  Building the hall on caissons would still damage the ruins of the original  mission below, said associate regional director John D. Cherry of the National  Park Service office in San Francisco. The park service has no authority over  privately held National Historical Landmarks such as the mission, and can only  offer advice, Cherry said.  </P> <P> The San Diego chapter of the Sierra Club and the Save Our Heritage Organisation  have also sided with project opponents.  </P></p>

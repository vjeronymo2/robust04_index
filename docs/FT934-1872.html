			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / International Company News: Profits warning hits Kodak shares Shares in Eastman Kodak, the troubled US photographic products group, tumbled 11.5 per cent yesterday after a profits warning from Mr George Fisher, the recently-appointed chairman and chief executive Mr Fisher said a review carried out in his first two weeks in the job had revealed that the company's profits next year would fall far short of stock market expectations. 'Consensus estimates of Kodak's earnings (are) well above what I believe we will be able to deliver,' he said. The company gave no indication of why the outlook for next year had changed. Mr Fisher, however, hinted that revenues would not grow as fast as the company had expected. Analysts had anticipated earnings up by as much as one third in 1994, as Kodak cut costs to rebuild its profits but Mr Fisher said growth would be 'quite modest, in the mid-single digit range, unless we see considerably more growth than now anticipated'. Earnings this year would be 'essentially level' with 1992, he added. Then, the company recorded net income of Dollars 1.15bn, or Dollars 3.26 a share. Kodak's share price tumbled Dollars 7 1/4 to Dollars 55 1/2 as analysts rushed to cut their forecasts for the company's earnings. By the close they had fallen below their level of six weeks ago, when the announcement of Mr Fisher's appointment cheered the stock market. Prudential Securities cut its forecast for this year by 30 cents a share, to Dollars 3.25, and for next year by Dollars 1.25 a share, to Dollars 3.50. These figures include the Eastman Chemicals business, which Kodak plans to spin off by the end of this year. Mr Fisher, hired from Motorola, where he was chairman, to replace the ousted Mr Kay Whitmore, continued to emphasise growth as the main way for Kodak to shrug off its earlier problems. While saying the company would have to lower its costs 'over time', he admitted this was not the long-term answer. The company would not make earnings forecasts in future, Mr Fisher said.</p>

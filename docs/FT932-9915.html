			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Rabin hangs on to coalition partner THE CRISIS threatening the fragile coalition of Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, was temporarily suspended yesterday after Mr Aryeh Deri, interior minister and leader of the ultra-religious Shas party, agreed to rescind his resignation from the government. Had the resignation gone into effect all five members of the Shas party would have pulled out of the coalition, leaving Mr Rabin with only a tiny majority in parliament. While the break-up of the coalition would not have brought about the collapse of the government, it would have severely limited Mr Rabin's flexibility and denied him the broad base of support he seeks in parliament to push through tough decisions regarding the peace process. The coalition crisis came to a head on Sunday when Mr Deri tended his resignation after Mrs Shulamit Aloni, the education minister and head of the left-wing Meretz party, refused to respond to his ultimatum that she leave her post. The ultimatum was issued following a series of remarks made by Mrs Aloni, which Mr Deri and party colleagues said were offensive to the religious. Mr Rabin yesterday proposed a temporary solution under which both interior minister and education minister will hand over their portfolios to the prime minister for the coming week, during which time a portfolio exchange among government ministers will be worked out to the satisfaction of Meretz and Shas. If a permanent solution is not found within a week, Mr Rabin is likely to begin seeking new partners for the coalition among other parties.</p>

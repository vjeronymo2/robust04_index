			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Book Review: A bite at an American giant THE UNMAKING OF IBM By Paul Carroll Crown Publishers Inc, 375 pages, Dollars 24 International Business Ma-chines has been crippled by arrogance, stupidity and a 'grid-lock culture', writes Paul Carroll. The computer giant, long revered as a model of American enterprise, has been brought to its knees by managers so intent upon outmanoeuvring each other that they lost touch with the realities of the marketplace, he maintains. In Big Blues, the Unmaking of IBM, Carroll portrays IBM at its worst, skimming over its achievements and emphasising its supposed mistakes. He ridicules individual IBM executives and dismisses them collectively: IBM is, he writes, 'like a music-publishing company run by deaf people'. The book is so one-sided that, as one independent industry observer says: 'The reader is left with the impression that the only good IBMer is a dead IBMer . . . the rest are either bad or ugly or stupid.' Carroll's perspective has been shaped heavily by IBM's critics. He cites in his acknowledgments 'senior people at Microsoft', IBM's rival in the personal computer software market, as well as former IBM employees, many of them embittered at losing their jobs. IBM refused to co-operate with Carroll. Thus, Big Blues provides, for example, accounts of meetings between Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman and chief executive, and IBM executives. The IBM executives are portrayed as clumsy, whereas Gates, seemingly, can do little wrong. Not that IBM does not deserve criticism. Even within the company, few would now deny that its cumbersome management structure has hampered its ability to adapt to changing market conditions. Unfortunately, however, the author never properly explains the underlying causes of IBM's falling revenues, losses and high debt charges. The roots of IBM's problems lie in the developments in computer technology that have slashed computer prices and lowered makers' margins. The PC was initially a boon for IBM, boosting its revenues and profits to record levels by the mid-1980s. However, as low-cost PCs began to account for an increasingly large portion of most companies' spending on information technology, growth in the more profitable mainframe sector - IBM's core business - slowed. PCs seldom directly replace mainframes, but by performing tasks that might otherwise have required mainframe upgrades, they, in effect, limit growth in the mainframe market, intensifying competition and putting pressure on prices. The average price of an IBM mainframe has declined by more than 40 per cent over the past 12 months, according to industry observers. This, more than any other factor, accounts for the company's decline in operating earnings. Carroll, however, concentrates on IBM's relatively lacklustre performance in the PC market - and plays down the problems of adjusting to the decline in mainframe profits. His theme is the 'rise and fall of the (IBM) PC and the rise and fall of IBM that went along with it'. IBM's biggest failing has been to 'squander its opportunities to turn the PC, or anything else, into a business that would wax as mainframes waned', he writes. If IBM had held on to a larger share of the PC market, its PC operations could be more profitable, compensating for declining mainframe profits, he implies. This might have been achieved, Carroll asserts, if IBM had only had the prescience not to allow Microsoft to license the DOS PC operating system program to other PC makers. This mistake, he reckons, has cost IBM more than Dollars 15bn a year in revenues by giving hundreds of companies an opportunity to sell 'clones' of its PCs that can run the same software. But the flaw in his argument is to assume that if Microsoft's MS-DOS had not become an industry-wide software standard, IBM would have been able to dominate the market and reap the rewards. Many would argue that the growth of the PC sector is in large part due to the availability of thousands of applications programs that can run on PCs from many different manufacturers. Apple Computer, the one PC maker that has stuck with its own software - the strategy that Carroll would have had IBM follow - trails IBM in terms of market share. Still, this argument provides Carroll with an excuse to devote much of his book to describing how a 'bunch of kids' from Microsoft outwitted the managers of Big Blue. When the Microsoft-IBM relationship began in 1980, he points out, 'IBM had 340,000 employees, Dollars 27bn of assets, Dollars 26bn of sales and Dollars 3.6bn of profits, while Microsoft began the relationship with 32 people and little else. IBM still found a way to lose.' Only in brief reference to the feelings of former IBM president Jack Kuehler, does Carroll allude to the possibility that Microsoft might owe much of its success to its partnership with IBM. Gates and IBM finally parted company last month when their agreement to work together on PC software expired. Neither is Carroll inclined to dwell on the fact that IBM's PC business is now winning market share from its competitors. IBM PC unit sales are estimated by industry observers to have risen by more than 30 per cent this year. Yet even if IBM were to triple its PC sales, the problem would remain: its worldwide operations were built to make and sell computers that returned a gross profit margin that is no longer attainable. To remain viable it must cut jobs. Big Blues throws light on the inner workings of one of the most complex corporate institutions in the world. It also contains an important lesson for all corporate managers: to remain focused on external competitors and not allow internal politics to consume their energies.</p>

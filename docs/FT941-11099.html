			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Arts: Visions to soothe the soul - Claude may have painted to order, but Patricia Morison is enchanted When Claude Lorrain died in 1682, his tombstone in Rome honoured 'the outstanding painter, who represented marvellously the rays of the rising and setting sun over the landscape.' Claude: The Poetic Landscape, the new exhibition in the National Gallery's Sainsbury Wing, could not fail to be a ravishing show, yet it takes a strangely oblique approach to 'the outstanding painter'. It asks two questions, who are those quaint little people in Claude's landscapes, and how much do they matter? It might seem like footling pedantry to draw attention to Claude's Achilles heel. Anyone can see that he was as bad at drawing people and cows as he excelled in depicting sunlight, clouds, temples and bosky trees. As he grew older, the classically robed figures with big chins and rubbery bodies grew larger and, in his last years, even more peculiar. In the Ashmolean Museum's 'Landscape with Ascanius Shooting the Stag of Silvia', Ascanius looks like a stilt-walker and the stag has apparently swallowed a whole baguette. Yet it is one of my favourite paintings, its strangeness inseparable from its haunting atmosphere. To other admirers of Claude, however, the beauty of his landscapes is inversely related to the prominence of his people. Even so, they will find Claude; the Poetic Landscape is a marvellous exhibition. Claude's vision of Arcadia is balm to the soul, just as it was to the jaded, world-weary cardinals and princes of his day. The National Gallery's 12 Claudes, landscapes and scenes of classical seaports, are shown with paintings and drawings from museums and private collections all over Europe. Paintings hang beside related drawings. They are wonderfully varied: atmospheric sketches from nature, ideas for compositions, and exquisite finished drawings like the Queen's 'View of Delphi With a Procession'. A number are from the British Museum's Liber Veritatis, the book which Claude, who despite his success seems to have been mildly paranoid, began to protect his compositions from fakers. Yet the schoolmasterly hand is hard to ignore. One effect of Claude's success was that richer men liked to buy his pictures in pairs so that they could enjoy contrasts in views, moods and times of day - a kind of pictorial equivalent of listening to Indian ragas. Some pairs split between different collections are reunited here, but some are hung separately, according to Claude's subject matter: the Bible, Ovid, Virgil, Apuleius and Tasso. These were perfectly standard sources for painters. However, a subject like 'Bacchus at the Palace of Staphylus', taken from the 5th-century Greek poet Nonnus, must have been the last word in intellectual chic. Claude, who initially wanted to be a pastry cook, was not an intellectual, like Poussin or Rubens. His stories must have been dictated by his patrons. In the catalogue (light enough to carry round the show) curator Humphrey Wine fleshes out his argument. Claude's clients were not just rich but clever, alumni of the top Jesuit schools and aristocrats who believed the blood of Virgil's heroes ran in their veins. To cater for their tastes, the people we see in the first room, shepherds, peasants and prostitutes, were replaced by figures in togas. Erudite clients asked for such uncommon scenes as 'Perseus and the Origin of Coral' from Holkham Hall and 'Landscape with Mercury and Battus' from Chatsworth. Perhaps they competed to devise ingenious themes for their poetic landscapes. For one papal courtier, Claude painted a classical port thronged with St Ursula and her 11,0000 Virgins, tripping down to the quayside armed with bows and arrows. For Cardinal Pamphili, Claude painted a seaport with a subject never shown before, 'The Embarkation of the Queen of Sheba', now in the National Gallery. It was hardly accurate to show the queen going by ship, given that the Book of Kings tells us she took a camel train to meet King Solomon. In Spain, taking poetic license with the Bible could have meant trouble with the Inquisition. Pamphili, however, was the pope's nephew and could call the tune. Besides, Claude would have made a horrible job of the camels. For the pendant, Pamphili wanted a golden afternoon and rustic merry-making. 'The Marriage of Jacob and Rebekah' shows a party in full swing, whereas according to the Bible, Jacob simply took Sarah into his mother's tent and got on with it. No one would even know what these two famous paintings represent if Claude had not inscribed the titles in the pictures. At least to his clients, the people in Claude's landscapes did matter. However, you may feel that the poetry of his paintings starts to dispel the more that is known about their origins. Take 'The Enchanted Castle', properly known as 'Landscape with Psyche outside the Castle of Cupid'. Wine suspects that Psyche's horrid fate was chosen by the philandering Prince Colonna as a warning to his wife not question his escapades. Is it not going too far, to see the origin of one of the best loved and most sublimely mysterious pictures in the National Gallery, source for Keats's 'Ode to a Nightingale', as a squalid philanderer's charter? Even worse is a recent, horridly topical, view of the brief given by the prince to Claude. 'The Enchanted Castle' was to illustrate the lines in Apuleius's poem in which Psyche considers whether to decapitate her lover Cupid that night as he slept. This is an exhibition which is sure to divide romantics and hard-heads. But to my mind, we can never know too much about the genesis of great paintings. The poetry and magic of Claude survives; as a contemporary wrote, 'one sees things from his hand which, surpassing all imagination, can by no means be described.' Exhibition continues until April 10; open until 8 on Wednesdays. Director's Evenings will be held on March 8 and 22; to book, ring 071-389-1771.</p>

			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Banks want to maintain Mirror's Labour stance THE FOUR banks which are majority shareholders in Mirror Group Newspapers said yesterday that they would be 'very concerned' if the political stance of the newspaper were altered from its tradition of supporting the Labour Party. National Westminster, Midland, Goldman Sachs and Lloyds have indicated that they would become more actively involved in MGN's affairs if they feared that the business was becoming unstable as a result of editorial changes. The banks' comments come against the background of criticism of MGN from the Labour Party, following the resignation this week of Mr Alastair Campbell, the Daily Mirror's political editor. Meanwhile, MGN last night denied that there was a boardroom rift over Mr Campbell's departure, which has also attracted criticism from Mirror journalists. Mr Charles Wilson, MGN's editorial director, said there was no split between Lord Hollick, the Labour peer, and Mr David Montgomery, brought in last October to become MGN's chief executive. Lord Hollick, chairman of the media and finance group MAI and Meridian, the new television station in the south of England, has rejected recent reports that he wants control of MGN. He declined to comment yesterday. Mr Wilson said: 'Lord Hollick is in a difficult position as a member of the Labour Party and a peer. He's with people at Westminster who are having their concerns agitated by elements within the Mirror - and I don't mean at boardroom level.' He added: 'There is absolutely no indication at all that this paper is drifting away from the Labour Party. We totally support the Labour Party.' The future of the the former Maxwell newspaper group lies in the hands of the four banks, whose 54 per cent stake is held by administrator Mr John Talbot of Arthur Andersen. The banks are communicating their views to the MGN board through Mr Talbot. They received the shares as security for loans. Yesterday the shares closed 2p higher at 109p, valuing the group at Pounds 430m. The figures compared with a 1991 flotation price of 125p, when the group had a market capitalisation of Pounds 501m. MGN's shares resumed trading last July at 53p, but have climbed steadily since October as investors have been attracted by the cost-savings which Mr Montgomery pledged to make. However, analysts said they would be concerned if the new management team's actions threatened MGN's valuable franchise on the left of the political spectrum. More than 150 Labour MPs signed a Commons motion criticising Mr Montgomery's approach following the resignation of Mr Campbell. Mirror journalists called for the resignation of Mr Montgomery and blamed him for the paper's continuing fall in circulation.</p>

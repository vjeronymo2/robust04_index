			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by military "source"] </F>   [Text] A military source at the Defense Ministry and the  General Staff Command has stressed that since they were  established -- and with the growth in their structure,  resources, and abilities -- the Armed Forces and security units  have remained a power owned by the people and following the will  of the people and their legitimate, Constitutional, legitimate  institutions in order to fulfill all their sacred national  missions. They are the protector and guardian of the people,  their security, stability, and their sovereignty, and the first  power concerned with preserving all national, developmental, and  democratic achievements and gains.    They are also the people's tool that will strike with an  iron  fist against anyone who may be tempted to encroach on any of  these gains and achievements.    Therefore, we warn against any malicious and base foolish  act  and any criminal, adventurous act that may seek to commit such  ugly crimes, even under the pretext of fabricating exposed media  lies. We refer, in particular, to the statement broadcast  yesterday over Aden radio, which is still under the control of  the secessionist, rebellious gang in the Socialist Party  leadership. The statement falsely claimed that our valiant air  forces -- the protector of the skies of the dear Yemeni homeland  and its blessed ground -- yesterday attacked the thermal power  station in Aden, as well as other selected targets, such as the  radio and television stations, and other vital and strategic  installations that belong to the people and are a source of  fortune and public interest and which should be protected by  every Yemeni individual.    But, what can we say to those who do not differentiate  between their rancorous lies, their crimes against the people  and the people's achievements, and their own sick aspirations?  Our people must know the truth about what may have happened to  these installations at the hands of the malicious people  themselves in their drive toward the abyss of fabricating  excuses to commit crimes of sabotage, destruction, and damage.    The falsehood, lies, and deceptive claims contained in that  statement are not worthy of any consideration or response on our  part. This will be confirmed by facts and evidence about other  lies and deceptive claims.</p>

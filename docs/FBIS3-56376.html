Back Again Empty-Handed"]    [Text] So far Clinton has not been too lucky in the field  of international policy. Admittedly, this is no longer giving  rise to pointed remarks as it did at the beginning of his  presidency: It was said that all his knowledge had been  acquired at the international club of blini lovers. But so far  the U.S. President has not won any laurels in this field.    His first European trip to Brussels, Prague, Kiev, Moscow,  Minsk, and Geneva was evidently undertaken in order to, first,  enhance and strengthen the U.S. President's international  prestige and, second, once again demonstrate support for B.N.  Yeltsin, of which the Russian president is permanently in need.    The problem is, however, that these aims are to a  considerable extent mutually contradictory and this became clear  during the first stage of Clinton's European marathon. In  Brussels he made public the new U.S. "Partnership for Peace"  concept. The package of measures -- as always bedecked in a  fine propaganda wrapper -- comprises a program for the phased  integration in NATO of the East European countries that were  formerly members of the Warsaw Pact.    The North Atlantic military alliance was at one time  propagandized in the West as a strictly defensive alliance and  its very existence and strengthening was attributed to the  existence of the "Soviet threat." You would have thought that  after the elimination of the Warsaw Pact and the  self-destruction of the Soviet Union, after the United States  was left as the world's only superpower, NATO should have  disbanded immediately -- being totally redundant. Especially  since, according to this military bloc's strategists, NATO no  longer has any enemies and Russia is now regarded as a friendly  democratic power. But they are not even thinking about  dissolving NATO! The United States is leaving its  100,000-strong expeditionary corps in Europe. What is more, the  latest phase in the policy of "rolling back" and forcing Russia  out of its traditional spheres of influence is beginning in its  new geopolitical form.    The White House administration has already declared NATO's  rapprochement with the countries of East Europe and their  subsequent integration within the military bloc as a "highly  important aspect of U.S. security." NATO Secretary General  Manfred Woerner does not conceal the fact that: "In the future  the countries of the former Warsaw Pact will be given a seat in  NATO. It is just a matter of time."    But at the moment Washington is maneuvering, preferring to  use the well-known sophistic method of describing as half-empty  a glass that is half-full and giving Yeltsin the opportunity to  do the same.    U.S. General Shalikashvili said: "We cannot simply move the  Berlin wall several hundred kilometers eastward." This cannot  be done "simply" -- there are not only organizational-technical,  but also psychological difficulties!    Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev issued an exploratory  statement: Russia may also decide to join NATO. To which  Polish President Walesa responded that he would support this  decision on one condition -- that Russia hands its nuclear  arsenal over to NATO control.    That is quite possibly what NATO strategists already want! A  few days ago Deutsche Welle reported a curious information leak  from NATO's Brussels headquarters: U.S. Secretary of Defense  Les Aspin suggested a concept, which presupposes "measures  including air and missile raids on arms production sites."  There was no reference to Russia and the concept has not  hitherto won official approval, but you will agree that the very  direction of NATO strategists' thoughts cannot fail to elicit  profound alarm.    All the more so since the NATO Council session involving  President Clinton has already adopted a decree couched in the  same adventurist vein: This is the first time that all the  military bloc's 16 countries have backed a long-standing U.S.  threat capable of causing an explosion of tremendous destructive  force in the "Balkan powder keg." The NATO countries agreed to  the possibility of carrying out air strikes on Bosnian Serb  positions.    This decision also constitutes a direct challenge to Russia.  After all, even Kozyrev's Foreign Ministry has recently begun to  talk (finally!) of a traditional Russian-Serb partnership. You  would have thought that the response to the NATO provocation  should have been immediate condemnation of this adventurism.  But no! Russia seems to have once again perceived a diplomatic  slap in the face as something fitting, once again sacrificed the  interests of its friends and, moreover, its own.    Before Clinton's meeting with Yeltsin, rumors came from the  Russian Foreign Ministry that were picked up by some  publications: If the U.S. President takes it into his head to  encroach on Russia's vital interests and, in particular, "tries  to introduce the concept of internationalizing the conflicts on  the territory of the former USSR, the Russian side intends to  put up stiff opposition to these attempts."    However, the rumors of a "stiff" Russian stance were simply  bluff. In effect, it was once again a one-sided affair and  Clinton understandably secured the diplomatic success planned in  Washington.    The U.S. President was particularly proud of the fact that  he  succeeded in persuading Ukrainian President Kravchuk to sign a  tripartite statement and memorandum, in which Ukraine pledged to  eliminate the nuclear arsenal left on its territory following  the breakup of the Soviet Union: It is a question of 176 ICBM's  and 15,000 nuclear warheads. Clinton described this as an  historic agreement although he acknowledged that it will give  rise to frenzied debate in the Ukrainian parliament.    Be that as it may, the first aim of Clinton's European  marathon seems to have been achieved -- at any rate, to some  extent. Things are far trickier as regards support for B.N.  Yeltsin. After all, the latest geopolitical concessions have  occurred against a new backdrop. Britain's THE GUARDIAN points  out that "pro-U.S. rhetoric has gone out of style in the Russian  capital." And as for Clinton's latest promises "of support for  Russian reforms," they are already generating ridicule, the  newspaper remarked sarcastically.    ...During the solemn ceremony in St. George's Hall in the  Grand Kremlin Palace Bill Clinton delivered a welcome speech,  which might be an illustration for Paragraph 545 of the primer  by John Wood and Dzhan Serre [name as transliterated],  "Diplomatic Ceremonial and Protocol," since it had all the  components befitting the occasion: a greeting to his host, the  general ideas behind the meeting, and, last, a desire for the  prosperity and happiness of the country and people. There was,  however, one blunder in the impromptu speech: The U.S. President  uttered the words "Soviet nation." But a quick-witted  interpreter omitted the careless phrase.    The host of the reception also observed diplomatic protocol  and, in the best U.S. traditions, "kept on smiling" as if saying  the English word "cheese" in front of the television camera.  Cheese is best supposed to "suppress the appetite" at  receptions! It was announced that Clinton has promised Russia  $900 million next year for aid with pro-Western reforms. This  is probably the "piece of fresh free cheese in the mouse trap"  that Aleksandr Rutskoy mentioned humorously before the summit in  Vancouver when describing Western "aid"....</p>

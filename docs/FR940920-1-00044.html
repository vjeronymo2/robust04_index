			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Selection of Designated Pollutants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The previous MWC NSPS proposal published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on December 20, 1989 (54 FR 52251) provided the rationale for the selection of ``MWC emissions'' and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as designated pollutants under section 111(b) of the Act. Additionally, section 129 of the Act specifies that emission limits shall be developed for PM, opacity, SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , HCl, NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , CO, Cd, Pb, Hg, and dioxins/furans. Emission limits for all but three of these pollutants (Cd, Pb, and Hg) were established in the February 11, 1991 standards. Section 129 also requires that siting requirements be established for new MWC's that will minimize, on a site-specific basis, potential risks to public health or the environment. Today's proposal responds to these new 1990 Act requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standards for fugitive MWC fly ash/bottom ash emissions are proposed today because these emissions contain PM, Cd, Pb, Hg, and dioxins/furans, which are components of the designated pollutant ``MWC emissions.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Selection of Affected Facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the proposed NSPS, the affected facility, an MWC facility, is defined as any setting or equipment chamber or pit used to burn MSW (including RDF) and extends to MWC fly ash/bottom ash emission points, including ash storage areas, conveyor transfer points, and ash loading areas for hauling trucks at the MWC site. This does not extend to ash handling outside of the MWC property boundary or at ash fill sites.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Municipal waste combustion includes the burning (or pyrolysis) of MSW in any type of equipment, chamber, or pit, including equipment with and without heat recovery. Municipal solid waste is defined as either a mixture or a single-item stream of household, commercial, and/or institutional discards. This would include discards such as paper, wood, yard wastes, tree trimmings, plastics, leather, rubber, glass, metals, and other combustible and noncombustible materials. The MSW definition includes household discards as well as discards from institutional and commercial sources, but does not include segregated industrial process/manufacturing discards or medical waste. The MSW definition also includes RDF, which is a type of MSW that is shredded (or pelletized) and classified by size before combustion. However, any mixtures of medical waste with nonmedical hospital waste or with household, commercial, or institutional waste is considered to be MSW.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any mixtures or industrial process/manufacturing discards with nonprocess industrial waste or with household, commercial, or institutional waste is considered to be MSW. Minor editing has been made in the definition of MSW to clarify this point.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cofired combustors are those that fire MSW with non-MSW fuel such as coal. Cofired combustors that combust a fuel feed stream comprised, in aggregate, of equal to or less than 30 percent MSW or RDF (by weight, based on a 24-hour average) would not be subject to the NSPS and would be required only to submit an initial notification of construction and subsequent reports of the amount of MSW and other fuels combusted. The exclusion of cofired combustors from the NSPS is consistent with section 129 of the 1990 Act. This exclusion is unchanged from the February 11, 1991 NSPS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Air curtain incinerators with unit capacities to combust greater than 35 Mg/day of MSW are subject to the proposal; however, air curtain incinerators that combust only tree trimmings, yard wastes, and clean untreated lumber (these are a subset of MSW) would be subject to an opacity standard and its associated testing, recordkeeping, and reporting, which are included in today's proposal, but would not be subject to any other parts of today's proposal. This exclusion does not apply to air curtain incinerators that combust other MSW materials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, waste-fuel power generation facilities that combust a single-item waste stream of tires, fuel derived solely from tires, or used oil would be subject only to an initial notification of construction and would not be subject to any other provisions in today's proposal. This exclusion is unchanged from the NSPS promulgated on February 11, 1991.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NSPS for MWC's proposed today would apply to MWC units at plants with capacities above 35 Mg/day. The lower size threshold of 35 Mg/day aggregate plant capacity for controlling MWC emissions under the proposed NSPS was selected after reviewing the population distributions of MWI's and MWC's. Most incinerators at medical waste facilities are smaller incinerators that fire segregated medical waste with general hospital discards (MSW), and these incinerators would have the potential to be covered by today's proposal. The population distribution of MWI's is distinctly different from the population distribution of traditional MWC plants that are the target of today's proposal. The existing distribution of MWC's is composed of about 179 plants, with an average plant size of about 600 Mg/day combustion capacity, with two or three MWC units per plant. Assuming continuous operation, the potential nationwide combustion capacity of existing MWC's is about 107,000 Mg/day. The MWI distribution is quite different and includes about 7,000 combustors with a single combustion unit per facility and an average unit size of less than 3 Mg/day combustion capacity. The total U.S. capacity of MWI's is about 20,000 Mg/day. This population is being addressed under a separate rulemaking. These population distributions of existing MWC's and MWI's are for existing units but are considered representative of new unit applications. Clearly, the MWC population represents a smaller number of comparatively larger combustors, and MWI's represent a much larger number of smaller combustors. The lower size cutoff of 35 Mg/day aggregate plant capacity that is included in today's proposal would exclude less than 1 percent of the total nationwide combustion capacity of MWC's and would result in over 99 percent of total MWC capacity being covered by the standards. The same lower size cutoff of 35 Mg/day would prevent significant dual coverage under the proposal by excluding more than 99 percent of MWI units and about 97 percent of nationwide MWI capacity from today's proposed revisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed standards would therefore cover the great majority of MWC's, but cover only a few of the largest regional MWI's (nine units at three sites are known to cofire medical waste with MSW and are above the 35 Mg/day total plant capacity cutoff). The Act of 1990 requires that regulations for MWI's be developed separately. For these reasons, it is appropriate that today's proposed standards focus on MWC's and that a separate regulation focus on MWI's. The NSPS and emission guidelines for MWI's are scheduled to be proposed in 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

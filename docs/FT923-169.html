			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Australian balance improves AUSTRALIA'S current account deficit narrowed significantly last month, easing fears that interest rates would have to rise to head off a balance of payments crisis. The deficit fell to ADollars 903m (Pounds 380m) in August in seasonally adjusted terms, from nearly ADollars 1.5bn in July. The unadjusted deficit declined from ADollars 2bn to ADollars 1.1bn. The government said the August figure was in line with its budget forecast that the deficit would rise from ADollars 11.7bn last year to ADollars 15.7bn in the year to next June, equivalent to 4.1 per cent of forecast gross domestic product. 'To all the Jeremiahs who were saying a month ago that imports are rising inextricably again, I think all this proves that you can't put that much store in one month's numbers,' said Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister. Economists said the figures should end speculation that the Reserve Bank would raise shortly official interest rates from 5.7 per cent to dampen demand for imports. However, the deficit is likely to widen over the remaining 10 months of the fiscal year as a result of forecast imports of civil aircraft, liquefied natural gas tankers and a recently launched telecommunications satellite. In seasonally adjusted terms, most of the reduction in the deficit was caused by an improvement in the trade account, which was in surplus by ADollars 338m following a deficit of ADollars 104m in July. Mr Chris Caton, chief economist at Bankers Trust, said the value of imports had probably been inflated by a recent fall in the value of the Australian dollar.</p>

			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOL HEALTH CLINICS  </P> <P> The San Diego Unified School District board made a move in the right direction  by approving, in concept, the high school-based health and social service  clinic ("School Board Takes Step Toward a Health Clinic," May 17).  </P> <P> Being a student at UC San Diego, I find it very convenient and helpful to have  a health service on campus. There is no need to worry if you cannot pay the  bill, because there is no cost to see a doctor. Without this service, I would  not be as inclined to see a doctor if I had a health problem, because medical  costs are so outrageous today. For students with little or no money, the health  center is a useful service.  </P> <P> Students who are in high school should have the same opportunity to health  services. Low-income parents can no more afford medical care for their children  than starving university students can. I feel the health clinics would provide  the much-needed services not available to everyone.  </P> <P> The question about family planning being included should be set aside for the  moment. This issue will take a while to settle and should not stop the health  clinic idea totally. The clinics are not based exclusively on family planning,  so this topic does not need to delay the approval of installing health clinics.  Improving students' health is the primary issue here, not birth control.  </P> <P> TED KNUDSEN  </P> <P> La Jolla  </P></p>

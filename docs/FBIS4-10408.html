			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] San Jose LA REPUBLICA in Spanish on 24  March on page 12A reports that public sector participation in  the loan market dropped from 43 percent to 20 percent during  1993, leaving the other 80 percent to the private sector. Jorge  Corrales, president of the Central Bank of Costa Rica, reported  that services received the larger portion of the funds, thus  showing a decrease in primary and secondary activities. He  explained that this behavior is consistent with current economic  trends, where services tend to show the greatest movement.</p>

			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SHERIFF'S DEPUTY ARRESTED IN FRACAS OUTSIDE BAR  </P> <P> An off-duty San Diego County sheriff's deputy with a good record was arrested  and jailed early Tuesday morning on charges of drunken driving and of  threatening two fellow officers with a handgun, law enforcement officials said.  </P> <P> Deputy Jose Raimundo Huizar, 28, had been drinking at a small Lemon Grove  nightclub, the Nite Life East, when two on-duty deputies made a routine check  of the club at about 1:30 a.m., Sgt. Glenn Revell said. When club employees  told them Huizar was being disruptive, the deputies spoke with him briefly,  then left the club, Revell said.  </P> <P> Huizar was "obviously intoxicated," said the club's general manager, Jeffrey  Houston, but did not argue when the club's employees asked him to leave.  </P> <P> Revell said Huizar and an unidentified friend were just leaving the club in a  vehicle when the on-duty deputies returned. They followed Huizar and pulled him  over in Spring Valley, Revell said, sparking a "confrontation" during which  Huizar brandished a handgun.  </P> <P> Huizar, a six-year department veteran, was booked on charges of threatening an  officer with a weapon, battery on an officer and driving under the influence of  alcohol. He was released on his own recognizance Tuesday and placed on  administrative leave from the Lemon Grove substation pending the outcome of a  criminal investigation.  </P> <P> Sheriff's Captain Jim Roache, who is on leave from the Lemon Grove substation  during his campaign for sheriff, said his staff had informed him of the  incident early Tuesday.  </P> <P> "It's one of those dumb things -- not thinking, consuming alcohol in an  establishment that I would prefer not to have my personnel frequent," Roache  said. "He apparently didn't use sound judgment. We expect our officers to  handle themselves in public as law-abiding, respectable citizens with the  utmost dignity. It appears this didn't happen in this case."  </P> <P> Roache added: "It's too bad, because the kid has a good record as a patrol  officer in Lemon Grove."  </P> <P> Huizar could not be reached Tuesday.  </P> <P> Revell said he could not divulge details of Huizar's personnel record, but said  he knew of no similar incidents involving him. He said that the Sheriff's  Department will conduct an internal investigation, but that the criminal case  will be handled by the district attorney's office. If charges are pressed, and  Huizar is found guilty, he said, it is unclear what disciplinary measures will  be imposed.  </P> <P> "That's up to administrative discipline channels," he said. "There is no set  discipline for each of those offenses."  </P> <P> Huizar is scheduled to be arraigned Nov. 20 in El Cajon Municipal Court, a jail  spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> Houston, the club's general manager, said his staff was unaware that Huizar was  a deputy.  </P> <P> "Both my security people and my manager did not know if he was a sheriff. He  could have been anybody. He could have been a construction worker," Houston  said.  </P></p>

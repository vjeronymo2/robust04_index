			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / International Bonds: Warm reception for Lebanon's debut offer The launch yesterday of Lebanon's debut eurobond was a resounding success, meeting so much investor interest that although the size of the issue was increased, it failed to satisfy all the demand, market participants said. After launching an initial Dollars 300m of the 10 1/8 per cent three-year bonds, lead manager Merrill Lynch raised the size to Dollars 400m in response to 'overwhelming' demand, according to a Merrill syndicate official. 'The issuer wanted the deal to be tightly placed, and we convinced them that even Dollars 400m would make no difference in terms of market reception,' he said. Indeed, the bonds saw keen demand from a wide variety of investors. 'There has been a lot of demand from retail investors, several institutions in the Gulf region, and the who's who of European funds and insurance companies,' said the syndicate official. A large portion of the paper was said to have been bought by Lebanese expatriates. The bonds were priced to yield 325 basis points over the corresponding Treasury bill, largely as expected. The spread on the bid price narrowed to 305 basis points over by the end of the day. In the D-Mark sector, the African Development Bank issued DM300m of 7 1/4 per cent five-year bonds. Priced to yield 24 basis points over the 6 1/4 per cent Treuhand notes, they saw good demand from German banks and investment funds in Benelux countries and Switzerland, said Deutsche Bank. Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley continued building the books for the World Bank's DM2bn global bond, which is expected to have a five-year maturity and be launched on Tuesday. The D-Mark sector today could see the launch of a DM150m 10-year bond for a government-guaranteed Japanese borrower. Societe Generale Acceptance made a rare appearance in the sterling sector, issuing Pounds 120m of 8 7/8 per cent three-year bonds. According to lead manager HSBC Markets, the paper met with good demand from continental European retail investors, who have recently shown keen interest in short-dated sterling paper. The bonds were priced to yield 40 basis points over the 8 3/4 per cent gilt due 1997, which was widely deemed to be fair.</p>

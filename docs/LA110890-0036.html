			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> WARMER WATER BRINGS RED TIDE  </P> <P> A red tide -- thousands of microorganisms nurtured by warm ocean water and fall  weather -- has invaded the Ventura County coast.  </P> <P> The tide, which shines red during the day and glows green at night, started in  small patches several days ago.  </P> <P> By Tuesday, the microorganisms called dinoflagellates spanned from the coast of  Ventura to Oxnard.  </P> <P> Although some red tides poison shellfish, officials said the tide Tuesday  appears to pose no health risk.  </P> <P> "It's a naturally occurring phenomenon that occurs during the warm periods of  the year," Reed Smith of the state Department of Fish and Game said.  </P> <P> "Occasionally, it can create problems with shellfish, but for years the tides  have not reached high enough concentrations to be harmful in Southern  California."  </P> <P> Steve White, district lifeguard supervisor, said the Ventura County shore gets  about a dozen red tides a year.  </P> <P> He said this tide, which could be seen clearly from the Ventura Pier, is the  largest one this fall.  </P> <P> "There will be some beautiful wave viewing at night," White said. "It makes a  greenish, luminescent glow. And sometimes, if you walk along the beach, your  footprints will glow." TINA DAUNT  </P></p>

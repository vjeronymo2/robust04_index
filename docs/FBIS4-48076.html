			<p>BFN     [Text] Afonso Dhlakama, Mozambique National Resistance  [Renamo] leader, will this week brief the Malawian authorities  and opposition on the controversial issue of Malawi Young  Pioneers [MYP] forces reportedly staying at Renamo bases. This  will happen when the Renamo leader visits Malawi this month,  before elections are due to be held in that country. Dhlakama  will be visiting Malawi at the invitation of the local  authorities. The Renamo leader says that there are no MYP  forces in his movement's bases. He also noted that all those  reports have been put out by the Mozambique Liberation Front  government.</p>

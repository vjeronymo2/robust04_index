			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Israeli Referendum is an Avoidance of </F> Peace Requirements"]    [Text] In a step showing how much he opposes peace, Israeli  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin hastened, after the positive  results of the al-Asad-Clinton summit, to announce his decision  to hold a public referendum on the issue of withdrawal from the  occupied Golan Heights should initial agreement be reached with  Syria on this issue.    This is as if Yitzhaq Rabin is telling the Syrians ahead of  time that any agreement that might be reached with them will  ultimately be subject to this referendum novelty, which is  unprecedented in Israel. This already cancels the issue of  negotiating over the Golan or any other territory if the Israeli  Government is not authorized to decide on withdrawal.    Indeed, what could Yitzhaq Rabin negotiate about with any of  the Arab parties if the final say will be for the Israeli man on  the street, whom we already know is inclined toward extremism  and intransigence, and whom we now realize is obsessed with  expansion after all the racism and racist grudge all Israelis  have been raised on?    It was hoped the U.S. reaction would be in line with the  Western democratic traditions which authorize the elected  governments to make decisions based on the conventional  parliamentary majority. However, statements by the new U.S.  ambassador to Israel contradict this rule adopted by countries  that champion democracy. He expressed the United States'  support for Yitzhaq Rabin's new notion, which is a direct blow  to all the agreements reached in Geneva just a few days ago.    The public referendum which Rabin is calling for is a new  Israeli evasion of the requirements of the peace process. It  also torpedoes the well known bases for negotiation. This is  especially true as long as the Arabs are negotiating with a  government that is giving up its authority to make decisions and  is leaving agreements that could be reached up to the mood of  the man on the street who could push an agreement one way or the  other based on the personal whims of his leaders and through  instigation and racist mobilization, all the effective tools  which Israel owns.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Madrid, February 14 (XINHUA) -- Spain would not join  the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in its possible  air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions, Foreign Minister  Javier Solana said today.    He explained that NATO, which has enough warplanes to carry  out the air strikes, would not need Spain's participation.    NATO has threatened to launch air strikes against Bosnian  Serb gun positions around Sarajevo unless the Serbs withdraw  their weapons or surrender them to UN control by midnight GMT on  Sunday.    The Bosnian Serbs were accused of launching a mortar attack  on a Sarajevo market earlier this month. The attack, which  killed 68 civilians and wounded nearly 200 others, led to  renewed calls for NATO's air strikes against Bosnian Serb gun  positions around Sarajevo.    Solana expressed the hope that the United Nations and NATO  would seek an end to the Bosnian war without resorting to force.    He was speaking to reporters before departure for a visit to  Andorra.    Solana also urged the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their heavy  weapons from around Sarajevo in a step "to actually lift the  siege of the city."    He said he had called on the United States, France, Britain  and Russia to help end the siege of Sarajevo through promoting  negotiations involving the warring parties.</p>

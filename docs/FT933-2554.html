			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sales of jewellery in Japan boost demand for platinum MR Barry Davison, managing director of South Africa's Rustenburg Platinum Mines, expects Japan's total platinum demand to reach between 63 and 64 tonnes this year, compared with 56.3 tonnes in 1992, Reuter reports from Tokyo. He forecast that the country's platinum jewellery sales would rise from last year's 40 tonnes to between 42 and 43 tonnes, thanks to healthy sales of lower-priced platinum jewellery. Rustenburg, one of three platinum group metal producers within the Johannesburg Consolidated Investment, is one of the world's biggest platinum producers. 'The growth in jewellery is expected to more than offset the reduction in the auto-catalyst sector,' Mr Davison said. Platinum demand for exhaust-cleaning catalytic converters for Japan's flagging motor industry was expected to fall by about 2.5 tonnes in 1993 from 9.5 tonnes last year, he noted. He added that the Japanese investment sector was likely to show resilience because of lower yen prices resulting from the national currency's strength against the US dollar this year. He declined to comment on expected price levels. According to Finance Ministry statistics, Japan's total platinum imports for the first seven months of 1993 were 37.67 tonnes on a customs-cleared basis, against 35.54 tonnes in the same period last year. US platinum consumption would also increase in 1993, mainly reflecting a recovery in car sales, Mr Davison forecast, while in Europe, demand would rise with the introduction of new regulations requiring all new cars to have catalytic converters, despite a drop in motor sales. He said he saw a slight increase in overall demand. Platinum supply will also get a boost from greater South African output, he said. 'Overall, 1993 demand/supply of platinum will more or less be in balance.' Mr Davison thought it was unlikely, however, that prices would rise dramatically for the time being. 'I don't see any major improvement in commodity prices in general, platinum group metals and nickel included, until there is clear evidence of a sustainable recovery in the world economy,' he said. 'Once such a recovery is under way, which will probably not occur for another 12 months, I do see the prospect of platinum group metal prices showing steady improvement,' he added.</p>

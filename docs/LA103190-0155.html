			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Sheriff verdict -- A headline on a Sept. 29 story about a verdict in a case  involving Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates mischaracterized the jury's  findings. The headline said in part that Gates "acted with 'reckless disregard'  for the Constitution in favoring friends." In fact, jurors made no specific  reference in their findings to any favoritism toward Gates' friends.  </P></p>

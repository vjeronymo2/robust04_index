			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Books: Last of the master storytellers - Biography DREAMS OF EXILE: ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON by Ian Bell Mainstream Publishing Pounds 14.99, 295 pages GEORGE Steiner has saluted Robert Louis Stevenson as 'among the last of the pure story-tellers.' This is an unnecessarily terminal judgment: there have been good story-tellers since RLS, from John Buchan to Jeffrey Archer. But it was as Tusitala, or 'teller of tales', that Stevenson was honoured on Samoa, where he finally settled; and it as a story-teller that he commands enduring affection. He wrote a good many essays, which are largely typical of their time - nicely-tuned, idling-over prose, with not much to say but yielding the occasional apophthegm. But he himself recognised the cogency of a good yarn. 'To the devil with your philosophy. When we are well again, and have an easy mind, we shall peruse your important work.' Weak-chested from childhood, he wrote stories to alleviate the tedium of being continuously prone to illness. So often he tells of a fever enough 'to kill a horse', or a throat oozing blood. It is a cliche to point this out, but the invalid commonly validates existence in this way, and seizes upon events and sentiments with a relish worth communicating. Illness did not inhibit his travelling (doctors then had the pleasant habit of prescribing long sojourns in the South of France as a cure for all sorts of maladies), and as this new biography shows, he would undertake deliberately squalid journeys with the aim of collecting material, or even as a test of his health. Yet his best stories are the fantasies of a bedridden man. Treasure Island came from studying an old map, and Long John Silver from that ebullient lame hack, WE Henley, whose journals promoted Stevenson, Kipling and others. Jekyll and Hyde was a straight nightmare, perhaps heightened by a medicinal dose of laudanum. Add to Stevenson's Gothic sense of enthrallment the diligent application of literary craftsmanship, and the result is a series of stories whose success enabled their author's emigration to the South Seas. He affected bemusement at this success, gloomily suspicious that he was only read by fellow- novelists, journalists and 'boys'. The truth was that men (and women) became 'boys' in these romances: metaphorically, whoever reads Stevenson is sat on his knee and mesmerised. His best travel book, Travels with a Donkey in the Cevennes, works the same wonder: as an adolescent I remember how much I loved the frontispiece of my edition, with RLS reclining in his custom-made woollen sleeping-bag, relaxed with a twilight smoke, and ready to tell you the tales of the day. Ian Bell's account of Stevenson is good on his Scottish origins, and better still on the nostalgia for Scotland which the emigrant never lost. He loved his native air, but it treated him roughly. Of the patriarchal, benevolent Stevenson of Vailima in the Pacific we are less well served. The affectionate account of the esteemed and emaciated author presiding over his plump Samoan tribe which was given long ago by Graham Balfour is not easily improved; and in any case, Stevenson gave a detailed and leisurely picture of his exile in his correspondence with Sidney Colvin (collected as Vailima Letters). Most of his time was spent in weeding, it seems. Bell is self-confessedly not a scholar, which permits him to quote without giving sources, and leave us with a downright inadequate index. The verbless sentences are too many, and RLS could teach this biographer a thing or two about style. But Bell gets Stevenson right as an essentially artful story-teller. 'He was a popular artist', writes Bell. And adds, wisely: 'The conjunction has become rare'. A handsome edition of 'Treasure Island' with illustrations by Mervyn Peake has just appeared in the new Everyman's Children's Classics series at Pounds 5.99.</p>

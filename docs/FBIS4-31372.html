			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Small Chances To Reach Agreement"] </F>   [Text] The Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM] Foreign Ministry reports that Foreign  Minister Crvenkovski met with the U.S. special envoy in the  Greek-Macedonia dispute, Matthew Nimetz, in Ohrid yesterday.  Today, Nimetz is to be received by President Gligorov. This  was the official announcement on the Crvenkovski-Nemitz meeting,  with no details on the contents of the talks, which gave space  to various media speculations. One such supposition even claims  that Greek diplomats also arrived in Ohrid, along with Nimetz,  and took part in the talks. The Greek prime minister bitterly  refuted this. The A1 Television finds out from sources close to  Papandreou's cabinet that Nimetz will probably not go back to  Athens, as the Greek government wishes not to heat up the  atmosphere four days before the elections for the European  Parliament. Unofficial sources also point out that even if  Nimetz does go back to Athens, there will be no one to receive  him. Papandreou did not receive Nimetz even last Monday, and  Papoulias left for Iran yesterday, and will afterward attend a  NATO ministers' conference in Istanbul.    Officially, the Greek government spokesman Evangelos  Venzelos  categorically denied all scenarios on new proposals by Nimetz,  pointing out that such speculations are harmful, rather than  useful for his country. He also underlined that the Macedonian  question would not be brought up at the coming EU prime  ministers' summit in Corfu.    Meanwhile, the media in Athens report on the talks in  Athens,  making no comments, and with a general conclusion that the  progress at the talks now depends entirely on Skopje. Thus, TA  NEA claims that Nimetz's aim was to put pressure on the  Macedonian leadership, while the Greek Foreign Ministry is  somewhat optimistic as to a way out of the dead end.    President Gligorov is of the opinion that there will be no  essential progress in the negotiations, despite latest  continuation in indirect talks under Nimetz's mediation, THE  DAILY TELEGRAPH wrote yesterday. MAKFAX reports that the  British paper concludes that the Greek embargo has considerably  damaged the Macedonian economy, already at losses as a result of  the sanctions against the Federal Yugoslavia. THE DAILY  TELEGRAPH points out the economic crisis is an additional source  of instability and could lead to a war, which would include  Serbia, Greece, Bulgaria, and Albania, with Turkey as a patron  of Tirana and the Turkish minority.</p>

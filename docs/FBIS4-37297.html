			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed DF: "Mr. Shim'on Peres on the Middle East </F> -- More a Philosopher Than a Politician"]    [Text]  <H5>  "Let Us Not Build the Future on Yesterday's </H5> Ramparts"    As a guest of Mr. Armand Clesse and the Institute for  European and International Studies [IEEI], Mr. Shim'on Peres  captivated a large and attentive audience at noon yesterday [14  June] in the European Center's amphitheater.    The initiator of the Gaza and Jericho agreements and a  tireless champion of peace in the Middle East, Israel's foreign  minister did not disappoint his audience. Quite the opposite!  His philosophy of life, his analysis of the region's future,  his views on the past are a splendid lesson in political dignity  and human warmth.    After the session was declared open by Armand Clesse,  [Luxembourg] Foreign Minister and long-time friend Jacques Poos  introduced Shim'on Peres to the assembly. He praised his  Israeli counterpart, a pioneer of the State of Israel, a man who  studied with David Ben-Gurion, an activist and official in  Israel's Socialist Party, a military expert, a former prime  minister, and the mastermind of Operation Jonathan which freed  Jews held hostage on Entebbe Airport in 1984.    But Shim'on Peres is much more than all this, as Jacques  Poos  did not fail to point out. Above all, as key negotiator with  the PLO, it was he who brought about the historic agreement  signed in Washington, he who made it possible for one of the  ideas he holds dearest to his heart to come true: the process  toward Palestinian self-determination and the surrender of the  occupied territories. The Gaza-Jericho agreement is a crowning  achievement for this visionary and genuine champion of peace. A  man, as Jacques Poos pointed out, who understood that economic  interdependence is peace's strongest bulwark, much stronger than  any diplomatic or military treaty.    "The Luxembourg Government and myself wish you good luck for  the future," the Luxembourg foreign minister concluded.  <H5>  The Lesson of Communism's Failure </H5>   "I am neither as good as you believe nor as bad as you say."  Such was Mr. Peres' humorous opening remark. Everything that  happened in the Soviet Union was unexpected. Experts are always  more adept with the past than the future. The Communist regime  suddenly collapsed in the USSR without external intervention.  In South Africa, or earlier in Argentina, change occurred in  the same way. From the inside, because the time was ripe.    Mr. Peres noted that communism's failure has caused a series  of changes which have left us bewildered, in a way. Our  traditional foes and the dangers they represented do not exist  any more and at the same time our traditional landmarks have  disappeared and we lack ready-made recipes for solving new  problems. It used to be easy for a U.S. president to get  Congress to allocate the money needed to fight Communism. But  convincing Congress to mobilize against nuclear perils is a  different matter.  <H5>  What Did Communism's Failure Bring? </H5>   The fall of communism showed that a modern power and economy  have nothing whatsoever to do with a philosophy, and that there  is no relationship between a country's geographical dimension  and its intelligence. Of course, Shim'on Peres added with a  smile, the gap between the intelligence of the Russian people  and the lack of intelligence of Communist leaders was never more  conspicuous than in the former Soviet Union.    From the moment that size loses its value, the importance of  armies and wars becomes very small. Indeed, one cannot conquer  intelligence. As a result, we are on the verge of a new age and  attitude. Notions of borders, sovereignty, political regimes  become fuzzy. One has to admit that there are much more  important factors, such as science, economics, information,  habits, clean air.  <H5>  The Impact of Information </H5>   The most significant revolution we have known in the second  half of this century is the information revolution. Any  dictatorship loses power as soon as it becomes impossible to  conceal its reality. And information flows through borders, it  brings up questions we must answer. No one can stop it, says  Shim'on Peres, and we had better look at new thinkers rather  than old enemies. This is true for the Middle East as for the  rest of the world.    To think rather than to remember, this is what matters.  Because memory, according to Mr. Peres, is very flexible.  <H5>  A Peaceful Region </H5>   Thus the agreements entered into with Egypt or the  Palestinians -- bilateral agreements -- already belong to the  past, as it were. The contention between Israel and the  Palestinians was not all that serious, he said. And yet it  turned into one of the most complicated problems of the second  half of the twentieth century. However, he added, we shall have  no peace as long as the Middle East as a whole has not become a  peaceful region, since peace cannot stop at borders either. And  missiles overtake it easily. As an example, Mr. Peres refered  to a missile launched in Moscow which can hit Washington six  minutes later.    The solution is obvious: A regional arrangement is needed.  This requires economic development. And a modern economy  cannot be based on the past, be it only because competition  takes over domination. Therefore what is needed is technology  and the ability to innovate. To win, Mr. Peres said, one must  create. Because economics can also generate trouble. For  instance, Israel would be seriously mistaken to believe it  exists in a vacuum and forget about what is happening around it.  <H5>  A Common Market </H5>   What the Middle East needs is a common market, Mr. Peres  explained. "Marshall Plans" are no longer appropriate. Such a  plan would be a waste of money. On the contrary, what is needed  is money to fuel the economy.    He reminded his audience that in the Middle East, $1  trillion  is spent on weaponry. Half of this colossal amount would have  been enough to save all the countries in the region.    How can a common market be created? By remembering the  origins of the EEC, and by gradually building common structures.    Mr. Peres advocated a step-by-step approach, the first two  steps being tourism development and a solution to the irrigation  problem.    Developing tourism is relatively easy, he said. This is a  light industry and the Middle East's architectural heritage is a  major asset. For instance, one could think of a tour including  Egypt's pyramids, the Petra Palaces in Jordan, and Jerusalem.  This would be a tangible approach to regional development. "If  I must choose between 10,000 blue berets and 10,000 tourists,"  he said subsequently, "I would obviously choose the tourists."    As for irrigation, he points out that the region's  population  doubles every 14 years. And 89 percent of the region is already  in a state of desertification. Turning this space into fertile  land would be a major progress. Mr. Peres indicated that in 25  years, Israel has managed to increase its soil 12-fold.    Water is not an insoluble problem, Shim'on Peres said. This  is the only way to guarantee a new future for the next  generations.  <H5>  Europe Can Help </H5>   Politically, a CSCM [Conference on Security and Cooperation  in the Mediterranean] should be created based on a three-pronged  foundation: security, economy, and human rights. Europe must  play a role in this, it must take part in the construction of  the Middle East. If it made use of its over-productivity which  creates unemployment, if firms -- and many of them have enough  money for this -- came and invested in the region, [Europe  would] succeed in ridding itself of its excessive productivity  while helping the Middle East, Mr. Peres stressed. And he  suggested combining two investment types: public and private.  He considered this a worthwhile approach for the future.    Mr. Peres concluded by saying that we are nearing the end of  the century. Its first half was difficult, plagued with war,  and the Holocaust. Its second half could prove more auspicious  if we succeed in changing our behavior before it is too late,  and if we surrender our urge to build the future on yesterday's  ramparts.</p>

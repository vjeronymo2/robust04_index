			<p>BFN     [Text] Kwangju, May 12 (YONHAP) -- Coinciding with the 14th  anniversary of the "Kwangju civil uprising," a local group of  victims of the bloody government suppression announced Thursday  it would lodge a criminal complaint against former Presidents  Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u and 33 others for alleged treason and  homicide.    "Ominnyon" told a news conference it would file the  complaint  with the Seoul district prosecutor's office Friday, adding that  321 victims of the May 18 civil uprising will be plaintiffs in  the complaint.    "We decided to file the complaint against the 35 people  because we considered it impossible to achieve true  democratization and harmony in the country, as well as cherish  the spirit of the May 18 civil uprising, without eliminating  those forces who want to dilute the spirit of the uprising to  maintain their vested interests," said an organization spokesman.    "The Kim Yong-sam government cannot achieve true reform  unless it brings to light the true picture of the massacre  during the uprising and takes judicial action against those  responsible for the massacre," said the spokesman, criticizing a  situation in which the victims themselves must take legal  action. In the meantime, an organization of bereaved families  of the uprising's victims said in a statement that the  anniversary should become a national event, fostering a mood in  which President Kim and government officials could visit  Mangwoldong cemetery where those killed in the Kwangju civil  uprising are buried.</p>

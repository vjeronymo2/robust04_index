			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / People: More moves at Pentos The Pentos shake-up continues apace, with the news that Ric Belfield, 33, a senior retail consultant with KPMG, is displacing Roy Crosland as managing director of Ryman, the stationery chain of the Pentos group. Last week Paul Hogarth was switched from his post as operations director at Ryman to take up the same post with Dillons, the bookstore chain of the group, and Frank Brazier - formerly chief executive at Dillons - abruptly departed the troubled group. Belfield's move from consultancy to hands-on management does not come completely out of the blue; Pentos is a client of KPMG's retail and distribution unit.</p>

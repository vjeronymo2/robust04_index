			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / When working would cost too much: Nancy Dunne on a family which Clinton's welfare reforms are designed to assist Little John, unlike most American children, has both his parents at home. His father, Mr Tony Wilson, a roofer, was badly injured in March 1991 when a scaffolding collapsed and he fell three storeys to the ground, breaking his back. Little John's mother, Mrs Maria Craig, is on welfare. Mr Wilson and Mrs Craig are now trapped in the 'safety net' which the US and state government provides to keep citizens from absolute poverty. It is people like them President Bill Clinton hopes to help with his welfare reform initiative, unveiled yesterday. Mr Wilson receives payments from Maryland's workers compensation fund, a scheme funded by the state's businesses but riddled with bureaucratic sandtraps. Although his medical bills were paid, Mr Wilson received no income for the first 18 months after his accident. After four trips to court, he now collects Dollars 10,816 (Pounds 7,163) a year, although in theory he is supposed to be getting two-thirds of his pre-accident pay. Mr Wilson said he was earning Dollars 500 a week before his accident but he had been working in that job for only two weeks. The stereotypical welfare mother of politicians' demonology is a black ghetto-dweller who has a baby every year. Mrs Craig, however, is much more representative, according to welfare experts. Like the majority of welfare recipients, she is white. Along with an eight-year-old daughter, Ashley, she was deserted by her husband five years ago. She has never been able to afford a divorce. No member of her family has been on the welfare rolls before. From the age of 18, for more than 12 years, she worked for one employer, an optician, fitting eyeglasses. When she left the job to have the baby, whose birth was unplanned, she was earning Dollars 22,000 a year. The state's welfare system provides her with Dollars 3,432 in cash and Dollars 1,428 in food stamps taking the couple's earnings to a total of Dollars 15,676. It is barely above the poverty line - calculated at Dollars 14,764 for a family of four - but there are powerful disincentives to her returning to work. At present she and her daughter are eligible for Medicaid, the medical care programme for the 'working poor'. Yet she would lose all these benefits and her welfare payments if she found a job. Mrs Craig could earn some additional money caring for other children, but would also lose her welfare cheque. She could go back to fitting spectacles, but she says the Dollars 150 a week she would have to pay for childcare (since Mr Wilson is often unable to carry the baby) and the Dollars 240 a month she would have to pay for health insurance would actually reduce her earnings. Even now, neither Mr Wilson nor Little John get Medicaid benefits. The workmen's compensation fund covers only healthcare related to Mr Wilson's injury. The baby is not covered because his father is in the home. This leads to Mrs Craig's skipping the baby's scheduled visits to the doctor unless he needs immunisation shots or is ill. 'I try not to think about the possibility of him getting sick, but when he shows symptoms - like an ear infection - I get petrified,' she says. Mrs Craig would be an ideal candidate for the welfare reform retraining programme proposed by Mr Clinton yesterday. A high school graduate, she said she would, if given the chance, study for a two-year college degree which would enable her to earn a higher salary. The retraining programme would also pay childcare expenses and allow recipients to retain their healthcare benefits. Meanwhile, the workmen's compensation fund has dithered. Mr Wilson has been waiting for months for back surgery, which his doctors see as his only hope of recovery. The workmen's compensation's doctor disagrees; the fund likes to avoid expensive surgeries. 'I had the physical body of a packhorse,' he said. I thought I would always have it. Instead I have to sit here getting stupider every day. Sometimes I go fishing. Sometimes I'm suicidal. I see it as an easy way out.'</p>

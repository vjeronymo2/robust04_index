			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  THE STAR </H8>   `Other Means' Needed To Secure kwaZulu Election Cooperation  -- Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 11 April in a page-10  editorial says the summit at Skukuza between State President de  Klerk, ANC President Mandela, Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini, and  Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi on 8  April "was a total failure." Zwelithini and Buthelezi "were at  least consistent: they reissued direct challenges to the  electoral process." Nelson Mandela "was clearly angry, but he  stopped short of spelling out what should be done to ensure that  those in the kwaZulu region who wish to vote are able to do so,  and those who wish to stay away are afforded the same freedom of  individual choice. That, after all, is what the dispute is  about (it is not about the IFP's participation, which is its own  business), and President de Klerk's attempt to claim progress  where there was non merely heightened the danger." Attempts to  "woo" King Zwelithini "away from the IFP's hard-line stance  finally failed, and other means to secure co-operation must now  be sought. Either Buthelezi must give a genuine assurance that  his administration will co-operate with the Independent  Electoral Commission, or the Government and Transitional  Executive Council will have to consider the grave option of  taking responsibility for an area which is, after all, part and  parcel of South Africa."  <H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>   ANC, IFP Not Serious About Political Solution --  Johannesburg  BUSINESS DAY in English on 11 April in its page-6 editorial says  the four-leader summit at Skukuza on 8 April "did nothing to  affirm that either the ANC or the Inkatha Freedom Party may  seriously be seeking a political solution before the conflict  settles into a brutal test of strength even uglier than that  which has cost 20,000 lives over the past 10 years." The ANC  made a "seemingly generous offer" to King Zwelithini regarding  his status and powers. The proposal offers to Zulu royalty "an  esteem and traditional powers compatible with the status of  royalty in any modern democracy." However the ANC proposal is  "marred" by the fact that it is "obviously a final, shallow and  cynical attempt to divide the king and Buthelezi." BUSINESS DAY  is "bemused" by the ANC's reluctance to make concessions.  "After all, if Inkatha is so weak in terms of popular support  that it can be `crushed', as most ANC strategists seem to  believe, then the ANC would presumably win a regional poll."  However, the election "must, and will go ahead," even if it  "will not, of course, resolve the conflict." "At the same time,  the election may clear the air a little. Inkatha's demand that  the poll be postponed will no longer be an obstacle. And when  he is stripped of the formal trappings of office, this may bring  home to Buthelezi at last the futility of his boycott of the  negotiating process." The election "is going ahead," and  Buthelezi "warns that his supporters are more angry than ever  before; he can probably expect the detention of the more  militant of those supporters as security forces seek to protect  lives and property."  <H8>  SOWETAN </H8>   Failed Leaders' Summit Makes Bloodshed Unavoidable --  Referring to the "failed summit" in Skukuza on 8 April  Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 11 April says: "State  President F. W. de Klerk, ANC president Mr Nelson Mandela, IFP  President Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Zulu King Goodwill  Zwelithini have left to a technical committee what they failed  to do -- reach an accord on the future of the Zulu monarchy,  free and fair elections in kwaZulu-Natal and an end to the  bloodshed in the province." SOWETAN believes the IFP's  "short-term tactic is to make the poll impossible in kwaZulu and  the rest of Natal and in the long term use the Zulu royal house  as leverage. Against this backdrop, more bloodshed is  unavoidable and the options are limited. More troops will have  to be poured into Natal to at least contain the violence. A  possible revolt within the Ulundi laager by dissident IFP  members and kwaZulu civil servants is the only factor likely to  influence events before the elections. In the meantime, the  country must brace itself for the worst."</p>

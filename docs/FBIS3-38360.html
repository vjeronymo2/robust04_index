Thus, a further step will be implemented within the  framework of the structural reform of air traffic control, which  was initiated in 1993 to privatize its legal organization. On  Tuesday [1 February], the Defense Ministry announced that 340  air traffic control officers and air data processors will be  given leave from the Bundeswehr to start work as employees of  the state-run Deutsche Flugsicherung GmbH (DFS) [German Air  Control]. In the long term, it is intended to provide some 500  soldiers.    The Bundeswehr members are to cooperate as one working team.  According to the Defense Ministry, their work will focus on the  control and support of military operational air transport to do  justice to the defense assignment of the armed forces. Outside  the responsibility of the DFS, Bundeswehr personnel will control  the airspace beyond an altitude of 7,500 meters at the  Eurocontrol headquarters in Maastricht. The merger of the  German air control services is intended to improve the  organization, flexibility, and efficiency to keep up with the  future development of air transport in Europe.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Graciela Garcia] </F>   [Text] On 7 March the Supreme Electoral Council [CSE]  approved partially repeating the elections for governor in the  State of Delta Amacuro on 10 April, the same date approved for  partial reelections in the State of Lara. It also agreed to hold  completely new elections in the State of Amazonas on 24 April,  as provided for in the Law on the Election and Removal of State  Governors.    The action was taken with six directors of the CSE voting in  favor and five against, with two, independent directors  abstaining.    Isidro Morales Paul, president of the CSE, said that in the  case of the State of Delta Amacuro, as well as that of the State  of Lara, the new elections would take place in only a certain  number of electoral districts, in accordance with the election  results annulled by the Supreme Court of Justice. In the State  of Amazonas the election will be completely repeated.    Furthermore, it was decided that the mayoral election in the  town of San Sebastian del Tachira (State of San Cristobal) will  be held on 17 April, while the mayoral election in the town of  Rojas, State of Barinas, was set for 15 May.    Morales Paul pointed out that a special commission will be  appointed, consisting of Rodolfo Zapata, director of data  processing; Manuel Vasquez, director of electoral systems; and  Carlos Flores Conde, (acting) legal consul. The commission will  review on a case by case basis the manner in which elections are  to be held to determine whether very short campaigns will be  required, as well as determine the budget necessary for holding  them.    Morales Paul stated that the approximate cost of these three  elections (in the States of Delta Amacuro, Lara, and Amazonas)  would be in the order of 40 million bolivares. He said that the  ordinary resources of the CSE will be used, "in order to avoid  harming the interests of the voters. We will request the  necessary funds through the Ministry of Internal Relations and  Congress."    For his part Ruben Jaen, an independent member of the CSE,  stated that the repetition of the elections would cost in the  order of 25 million bolivares in the State of Amazonas and 100  million bolivares in the States of Lara and Delta Amascuro. He  said: "The immense expenditure which is going to be incurred, in  the absence of these new elections being entirely justified,  should be a matter of concern to us."    Jaen said that he does not agree with the decision by the  Supreme Court of Justice, although he respects it. At the same  time he emphasized the fact that this decision of the Supreme  Court "does not order the repetition of elections in the State  of Lara but rather orders the CSE to determine the impact which  such a cancellation would have on the overall result of the  elections."    He pointed out that these decisions--in his view not  supported by arguments of sufficient weight--threaten to keep  the country in a permanent state of elections. He went so far as  to say that: "From now on the slogan of Venezuela will not be  that it is a country to love but a country to vote, since there  will be very frequent elections."</p>

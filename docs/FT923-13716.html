			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Arts: The Habsburgs in Spain - A celebration of the consequences of a famous marriage IN 1496, no one would have thought that Emperor Maximilian I of the Habsburgs had signed 'the most remarkable marriage contract in the history of modern Europe'. The marriage of his heir, Philip the Handsome to Joanna of Castile, second daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain, was certainly a respectable match. Then Fortune turned her wheel, and their son Charles V, became heir to a world-empire. Hispania-Austria is a magnificent exhibition celebrating the birth of two centuries of Habsburg rule in Spain. It has been mounted jointly by the Austrian and the Spanish ministries of culture and is 70 per cent the same as the show at Toledo this spring, Reyes y Mecenas. However, the 30 per cent difference matters, and anyone with a chance to notch up both shows should certainly take it. (The exceptionally thorough catalogues differ correspondingly between the German- and Spanish-language versions: Electa Press, Sch500). The exhibition's somewhat daunting subtitle is 'The Catholic Kings - Maximilian I and the Origins of the Casa de Austria in Spain.' In Austria, this means more emphasis on the absorbing personality of Maximilian the match-maker himself. None the less, one could hardly hope to see a rarer, better-exhibited display of art in late 15th-Century Spain (which of course, includes many Flemish artists) than the first floor of the exhibition. Anyone who knows how difficult it remains to glimpse, let alone see properly, artistic treasures in Spain's sacristies and religious houses, will relish the privileged view Hispania-Austria offers. There are dozens of panel paintings and painted wooden sculptures, incredibly beautiful tapestries and liturgical treasures. The huge funeral pall of the de Velascos, Constables of Castile, looks as fresh as if it were made yesterday. The embroidered manga (a processional crucifix stand) was the gift to Toledo Cathedral of Cardinal Ximenes de Cisneros, responsible for expelling the Jews and unleashing the Inquisition. One of the most exceptional pieces is a memorial bronze from Badajoz Cathedral of a young Spanish ambassador who died in Venice in 1506. Possibly made by Alessandro Leopardi, it is a full-length and astonishingly lifelike portrait of Lorenco de Figueroa, not in armour but dressed informally and holding carelessly, almost with disdain, his sword and shield. Added to them are treasures from Austrian collections, principally from Vienna, and further superb loans of books, paintings, and prints, from Brussels, Amsterdam, the Louvre, and Berlin. Among the painters, names to conjure with are Bartolome Bermejo, Cranach the Elder, Durer, Hans Burgkmair, Gerard David, and Pinturicchio. There are a quantity of historic portraits, including Michiel Sittow's lovely portrait of our own Catherine of Aragon, bride to Henry VIII. One will linger over shows Mary of Burgundy, Maximilian's much-widowed daughter. Recently thought to be by Michael Pacher, it is a lovely image of a lady as pale and fine as alabaster, and, since it belongs to a private collector, who knows when it will be seen again. Exhibits of such quality and variety leave an unforgettable impression of the artistic scene in Europe around 1492. And where is one to see these exceptional riches? Not, for once, in Vienna, but in Innsbruck, capital of the Tyrol. Hispania-Austria marks an important break in the Austrian government's tradition of cultural centralism. Schloss Ambras is a Renaissance castle in the foothills of the Alps, 10 minutes' drive from Innsbruck. The exhibition occupies three floors of the upper castle which is normally closed to the public. It is not just a case of matching nice objects to nice place. Schloss Ambras is a Habsburg castle, remodelled by Maximilian's grandson, Archduke Ferdinand. In the lower castle - assuming you have any strength left after this huge show - do visit Ferdinand's own extraordinary collection. The first museum to be made north of the Alps, it is full of bizarre kitsch which speak volumes for the tastes of Renaissance princes. On the second floor of the exhibition, which is devoted to Maximilian, the choice of venue becomes still more satisfying. Among the Emperor's umpteen titles was Landesfurst of Tyrol and in all Maximilian's widely-scattered lands, there was nowhere he preferred to be than in the Tyrolean Alps. In Innsbruck, as every tourist knows, he was betrothed and gave the famous Golden Dachl to his bride. But sentimentality had nothing to do with Maximilian's predilection. He loved to hunt and fish, and the Tyrol offered the best and most perilous fun of all, scaling peaks armed with crossbows and huge spears in search of chamois. And being Maximilian, he was ready with the tale of how, when he lost his way on the Martinsberg, an angel appeared and set him on the right path. There is something deeply satisfying about looking at Maximilian's hunting crossbow and flattering images of his hunting exploits, and then looking out of the window at the encircling forests and snowcapped peaks. Maximilian's money, too, which he spent with such incredible panache, came in large part from the iron and silver the miners dug from those mountains. In the Hofkirche in Innsbruck stand the lifesize iron figures of heroes, guarding the tomb where Maximilian's body would have rested, had he not squeezed the citizenry beyond endurance with taxes - and never paid his bills. It is good to remember that fact, swept away as a visitor may well be by the potency and persuasiveness of Maximilian's vision of his own importance. He wrote romances and corrected the lavish presentation manuscripts in his own hand. He exploited the new medium of the printing press to make his image known throughout the empire. He was the sainted, knightly hero of his own personal romance. These days, 'historic trails' are all the rage with tourist offices. If ever there was an exhibition which justified a trail, it is Hispania-Austria: on the trail of Maximilian, through the Tyrol. Runs until 20 September, daily. To book, ring +43 (512) 5924407, 5924409. No parking at the castle but free shuttlebus from points in Innsbruck</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "So This Is the Agreement"] </F>   [Text] The Russian Government has unilaterally prepared a  number of draft documents designed to resolve urgent social and  economic problems.    "It has thereby violated the basic principles of social  partnership," Mikhail Shmakov, chairman of the Federation of  Independent Trade Unions of Russia [FITUR], believes.    At the same time the leader of Russia's trade unions  mentioned the decree "On Measures To Ensure Employment for the  Population in the Event of Crisis Situations in the Labor Market  in Various Regions of the Russian Federation," the proposed  measures to freeze wages, and so forth; these have not been  published anywhere, but they have nevertheless been cited in a  number of mass media and speeches by officials, including Labor  Minister Gennadiy Melikyan.    Shmakov stressed that both the trilateral general agreement  between the government, employers, and trade unions and the  Treaty on Social Accord envisage preliminary discussions and  coordination with trade unions regarding any legislation that  affects social and economic issues.    This was why the trilateral commission on regulating social  and labor relations was established. But this, according to M.  Shmakov, has been standing idle recently. Attempts by  representatives of trade unions and employers to familiarize  themselves with the drafts of these documents have proved  unsuccessful.    The FITUR leadership believes that the predictions made by  opponents of signing the Treaty on Social Accord are being borne  out; they warned that "the government will take no account of  the `signatories'."    In conclusion, M. Shmakov stated that, in the situation as  it  stands, any discussion by trade unions of documents of a  socioeconomic orientation will only be possible once the  government has met the following conditions: An increase in the  minimum wage to 40,000 rubles and provision of state guarantees  that the Law on the Indexation of the Minimum Wage will be  implemented.</p>

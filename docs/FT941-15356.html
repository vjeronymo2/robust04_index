			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Watchdogs are required This has been another week that the Conservative government would rather forget. It began with a wave of scandal breaking around the government's supporters in Parliament. This ebbed somewhat with the announcement of the death of Lady Caithness, wife of the junior transport minister whose marriage was said to be in difficulty. But confusion has continued over exactly what the prime minister meant with his back to basics campaign. Even if he did not mean it to apply to ministers' behaviour, Conservative party members seem to think that it should. Mr Major has looked indecisive in his unwillingness to enforce the new morality on his own ministers. The week ended with accusations of gerrymandering in the London Borough of Westminster. This flagship of Conservative local government was feted throughout the 1980s for its slick management and entrepreneurialism. According to the district auditor, it was also using public money for electoral advantage. Council flats were sold and homeless families ejected from marginal wards to keep the borough Conservative. More bad weeks are likely to follow. Taxpayers will feel the impact of hefty tax increases announced in the last two Budgets at the start of the new financial year in April. Local authority elections in May will provide an early opportunity for the voters in London and other urban areas to register dissatisfaction. And Conservative expectations for the European elections in June are already being talked down. On Monday, Mr Major must appear in front of the Scott inquiry, which is investigating the scandal over the sale of arms to Iraq. The public interrogation of the prime minister by such a tribunal is unprecedented in recent British history. It is also likely to prove an uncomfortable experience - as a succession of serving and former cabinet ministers have already found. Best way Lord Howe, the former foreign secretary, voiced the concern of senior officials this week when he accused Lord Justice Scott of acting as 'detective, inquisitor, advocate and judge'. Yet the inquiry's procedures are the best way to uncover the truth in a reasonable time to the satisfaction of the public. When the inquiry's report appears later in the year, it must be able to explain how three businessmen came to be prosecuted for selling arms to Iraq when they had done it with the encouragement of a government department. There is, of course, nothing new in duplicity, deceit or corruption in government. It is arguable that the democratic process is based on a potentially corrupt bargain between voters and politicians. The latter bid for the former's support by promising higher incomes, lower taxes or more 'free' services. The voters award the prize to the politicians who makes the best and most plausible offer. Those who fail to deliver, however, can expect to be found out and penalised in future elections. Dividing line And it will always be tempting for politicians to use the power of government to improve their chances of holding on to it. Herbert Morrison, the Labour leader of the old London county council, bragged that he would 'build the Conservatives out of London' by building council homes for Labour-voting tenants. Many Conservatives believed that selling council homes to their tenants would convert them into Tory voters. But while the dividing line between legitimate housing policy and gerrymandering can be a fine one, it can be drawn. If a council builds homes or sells them off with the objective of changing the voting patterns of marginal wards, that line has been crossed. The dangers that power will be abused increase when there are long periods of single-party rule. Parties which face no real challenge at the ballot box increasingly discount the legislative niceties. Policy changes over arms sales which could be embarrassing internationally are slipped through without bothering to tell Parliament. Ministers avoid telling lies - but they do not feel obliged to tell the whole truth either. They appoint their own supporters to key posts in quangos or to plum jobs in local government. Their officials forget their duty to serve the public good and become enmeshed in party politics. The checks and balances need to be cultivated and strengthened in one-party states, whether at local or national level. Much more information needs to be provided about decisions, for example, so that secrecy does not conceal corruption. An appointments commission should oversee the thousands of appointments to the growing numbers of quangos. Protecting the independence of public servants from undue political pressures may require new measures, including an independent appeals procedure if they feel pressured to act improperly. Above all, close scrutiny of the executive is required. The district auditor has proved his worth. The Audit Commission, the National Audit Office and the various ombudsmen can all help in preserving standards. The press, too, has a role to play.</p>

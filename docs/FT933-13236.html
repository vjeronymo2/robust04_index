			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / International Company News: Whirlpool surges 39% to Dollars 74m WHIRLPOOL, the world's biggest maker of large home appliances, yesterday reported a 39 per cent leap in second-quarter net earnings, helped by higher unit shipments and cost-containment efforts. The company reported net earnings of Dollars 74m, or Dollars 1.04 a share, against Dollars 53m, or 75 cents, in the same period of last year on revenues which rose 4 per cent from Dollars 1.83m to Dollars 1.91bn. Mr David Whitwam, chairman, said the quarterly earnings and unit shipments and sales were the company's best ever. 'Our emphasis on productivity improvement and cost containment continues to produce outstanding operating leverage,' he added. In North America, the company said revenues and earnings both ran well ahead of 1992 performance. Industry shipments of the nine most important home appliances were up around 2 per cent in the quarter and were expected to be up around 3 per cent for all of 1993. In Europe, the company's unit shipments rose despite a comparatively weak industry performance and the continent's recession. Operating margins improved, helped by lower selling and administrative expenses and a 'notable year-over-year improvement within the subsidiary's compressor operations'. Whirlpool expected European industry shipments for 1993 to be off about 2 per cent from 1992. Other overseas operations saw revenues nearly double, though planned selling and administrative expenses for expansion in Asia contributed to a drop in operating profits. For the first six months, Whirlpool suffered a net loss of Dollars 88m, or Dollars 1.23 a share, compared with net earnings of Dollars 88m, or Dollars 1.25, in 1992. However, 1993's first-quarter figures were affected by two special charges, without which first-half earnings would have totalled Dollars 132m, or Dollars 1.85 a share.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 13 (CNA) -- The Republic of China [ROC]  is about to sign a contract with the United States to buy  Patriot missiles, National Defense Minister Sun Chen said Friday  [13 May].    Sun made the statement in reply to an inquiry by Democratic  Progressive Party Legislator Trong Chai, who demanded that  Taiwan step up its defense capability to guard against the  possibility of attack by Mainland China.    Sun, the former president of National Taiwan University,  told  the legislative chamber that of the missiles currently available  in the world, only the Patriot is capable of intercepting  missiles.    He said Taiwan would purchase the Patriot model known as the  PAC- II, a revised model of the one that functioned effectively  against Scud missiles fired by Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War.    Sun said negotiations for the arms sale have been under way  for some time, and are almost complete. Yet he did not reveal  the value of the arms sale.    Sun also told the legislature that the first squadron of  locally manufactured Ching Kuo jet fighters, better known as  "Indigenous Defensive Fighters," will be commissioned before the  end of the year. They will be equipped with Tien Chien, or "Sky  Sword" air-to- air missiles, he said.    The air force is scheduled to acquire 120 of the combat  aircraft. Taiwan has also contracted to buy 150 us-made F-16s  and 60 French Mirage 2000-5s.    The army also has completed the deployment of the first  battery of Tien Kung ground-to-air missiles, Sun said. Dubbed  "Sky Bows," the missiles were developed by the Chung-shan  Institute of Science and Technology.</p>

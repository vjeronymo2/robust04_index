			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS analyst Vladimir Gondusov] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 18 TASS -- The pledge made by the  Russian and American presidents at their Moscow summit to target  Russian and American missiles away from the major cities of the  two countries before May 30, 1994 was largely political and  diplomatic in nature, intended to demonstrate a warmer  relationship between Moscow and Washington, a briefing in the  Russian Defence Ministry was told today.    As concerns the military aspect of the relevant clause in  the  Moscow declaration, which Yeltsin and Clinton signed last week,  the change of targets reduces the first-strike threat, the risk  of an unsanctioned launch, and thereby the danger of nuclear war  in general, according to Major-General Anatoliy Svetikov, who  represented the Russian strategic missile forces at the briefing.    The presidents promised to re-target their missiles not  later  than May 30, 1994. But in actual fact, target coordinates can  be changed within 15 to 20 minutes, the general said.    According to specialists, the procedure is not very  complicated -- the target coordinates which can guide a missile  to the United States or Russia will be replaced in the missile  computer memory with the coordinates of one or another deserted  areas in the world ocean.    According to American sources, about twenty such areas have  been identified to become the main targets in the missile  computer memories. Reserve coordinates will be saved in the  memory as well. If all coordinates are deleted from memory, the  missile can hit land in the same area from which it was launched.</p>

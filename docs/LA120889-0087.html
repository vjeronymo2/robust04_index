			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLUOR REPORTS SHARPLY HIGHER EARNINGS  </P> <P> Citing growth in its engineering and construction business -- particularly  overseas -- Fluor Corp. reported earnings Thursday of $108.5 million for fiscal  1989, up 92.4% from net income of $56.4 million last year.  </P> <P> The strong earnings punctuated Fluor's continuing three-year recovery since it  began a painful restructuring and turned away from the oil and minerals  business. The Irvine-based company's revenue for the year ended Oct. 31 was  $6.23 billion, up 21.4% from 1988's $5.13 billion.  </P> <P> For the fourth quarter, the company, the largest publicly held firm based in  Orange County, reported earnings of $29.1 million on revenue of $1.67 billion,  compared to earnings of $23.6 million on revenue of $1.61 billion a year ago.  </P> <P> Industry analysts said Fluor's performance was on target with expectations.  Wall Street reacted favorably to the earnings report, as Fluor's stock closed  up $1.25 at $33.625 a share on the New York Stock Exchange.  </P> <P> David S. Tappan Jr., who is stepping down as Fluor's chief executive next  month, said the company's engineering and construction business did well, as  did its coal and lead investments. He also attributed the company's financial  growth to a 44% expansion of its international business, which accounted for $2  billion of the company's $8.4-billion backlog of orders as of Oct. 31.  </P> <P> "We are naturally pleased with our earnings progress last year but we still  have a long way to go to produce the superior results we are capable of  delivering," Tappan said in an interview Thursday. "I think Fluor Daniel's (the  company's main operating unit) market strength and geographical diversification  makes us very confident that we've only scratched the surface of the growth and  earnings potential that lies ahead of us."  </P> <P> Leslie G. McCraw, Fluor's president who is being promoted to chief executive in  January and will succeed Tappan as Fluor chairman in 1991, is taking the reins  at Fluor at a time when analysts predict its fortunes are on the upswing.  </P> <P> "I think McCraw is taking over at a time when the momentum at the company is  very, very strong. The backlog and the profit margins are still rising," said  Mark Altman, a securities analyst with Paine Webber in New York.  </P> <P> Industry analysts expect Fluor to achieve greater profitability in 1990. Altman  said he believes the company will generate net annual income of $150 million  and Alan Dorsey, a securities analyst with Dillon, Read &amp; Co., said he  expects the company will generate net income of between $160 million and $165  million.  </P> <P> Tappan said that with the prospects good for an extended growth cycle, the  company will be investing in development and training of engineering and  construction personnel and in computerized engineering and internal  communications systems.  </P> <P> Tappan, 67, postponed his retirement for two years to preside over the  restructuring of Fluor. In 1985 and 1986, Fluor suffered heavy losses due to an  ill-timed investment in the minerals business and a dive in oil prices that  killed demand for the large petrochemical projects that were then Fluor's main  source of revenue.

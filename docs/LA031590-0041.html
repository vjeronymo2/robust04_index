			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PANEL OKS WILMINGTON ZONING PLAN  </P> <P> A Los Angeles City Council committee unanimously approved changes in the  long-awaited Wilmington-Harbor City community plan Tuesday, paving the way for  the plan to come before the full council sometime next month.  </P> <P> However, the Planning and Land Use Management Committee delayed action for  three weeks on a proposal to limit the number of oil wells in the Wilmington  Oil Field and on two proposed zoning changes in Harbor City.  </P> <P> Mario Juravich, deputy for City Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, whose district  includes Wilmington and Harbor City, said the delays should not affect the  plan's progress.  </P> <P> "We think we can have this before the full City Council in five weeks,"  Juravich said after Tuesday's hearing.  </P> <P> A proposal to create a Historic preservation overlay zone in the area south of  Banning Park was not addressed Tuesday. The proposal, which has divided  residents in the neighborhood, must go through a number of separate committees  and public hearings.  </P> <P> The updated community plan, which will govern growth of the area until 2010,  has been winding through the city bureaucracy for more than six years. The  revision would significantly alter a 1970 plan that has allowed new factories  and heavy industry to be built alongside residential neighborhoods in  Wilmington.  </P> <P> About 20 Wilmington residents attending the hearing were ecstatic at the  committee's strong support of the plan.  </P> <P> "I think we have to call this a first for us. We are actually going to get some  real planning happening for Wilmington," said Peter Mendoza, president of the  Wilmington Home Owners, the largest neighborhood group in the community.  </P> <P> Wilmington residents have contended for years that their community is the "poor  stepsister" of Los Angeles, and planning officials acknowledge that Wilmington  has the highest concentration of land zoned for industry of any community in  the city.  </P> <P> The revised plan approved by the committee Tuesday seeks to reduce the impact  of industrial development by creating buffers around residential zones and by  changing zoning in east Wilmington to allow only single-family homes in several  mostly residential areas. The plan allows the city to set up timetables  requiring incompatible industries to move. The plan would also encourage  industrial development in an area farther east of the residential  neighborhoods.  </P> <P> Wilmington residents expressed particular pride Tuesday in their successful  efforts to persuade the Planning Commission to extend the residential-only  zoning to several neighborhoods that were not included in previous drafts of  the plan.  </P> <P> "We are very hopeful about the decision to change the zoning to (residential)  in east Wilmington. That has always been one of our goals," said Joann Wysocki,  vice president of the Wilmington Home Owners. "Our aim is to start improving  the area, to get people to live there and upgrade it."  </P> <P> Although Councilman Hal Bernson indicated early in the hearing that the  committee would probably approve the revisions, an attorney for Exxon persuaded  the committee to delay discussion on the oil field for three weeks. Joan A.  Wolff told the commission that reclassifying the Wilmington Oil Field as an  urbanized area, as proposed in the plan, would force the company to cap several  operating wells. In an urbanized area, fewer oil wells per acre are allowed to  operate.  </P> <P> "Exxon cannot simply pick up its oil wells and move them to a different  location," Wolff said.  </P> <P> In an interview Wednesday, Wolff said she could not say what the potential  effect of the reclassification would be.  </P> <P> Three other representatives of businesses that could potentially be affected by  the proposed restrictions also spoke in opposition. The owner of an auto  salvage yard said the plan would prevent expansion of his business, and an  attorney for Gunn Van Lines, a moving and storage company in a residential  neighborhood south of Pacific Coast Highway, complained that new zoning could  force the company to relocate.  </P> <P> The committee delayed action on two proposals involving height restrictions in  the Harbor Pines area after a resident said she needed more time to find out  how they would affect her neighborhood.  </P></p>

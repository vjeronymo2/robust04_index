			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Revenue quizzed BBC over Birt 4 years ago THE BBC was challenged more than four years ago by the Inland Revenue over the employment status of Mr John Birt, its director-general. The Revenue, which has for years been tightening the rules for freelances who work entirely or predominantly for one employer, wrote to the corporation questioning Mr Birt's arrangement less than two years after he became deputy director-general. The BBC decided at the time to defend the practice. It is believed that the BBC's tax advisers, Coopers &amp; Lybrand, were used to rebut the Inland Revenue approach, which was not renewed. It is unclear whether Mr Marmaduke Hussey, chairman of the BBC, knew about the Inland Revenue's approach, although he is ultimately responsible for the remuneration of both the director-general and the deputy director-general. A row erupted at the end of February when it was revealed that Mr Birt had not joined the corporation's staff. Instead he was hired as a freelance consultant, initially as deputy director-general, and was paid through his private company, John Birt Productions. He finally joined the BBC staff last week. Mr Birt has also received contributions to his private pension from the BBC in addition to his basic pay. These payments have never been disclosed. The pension contributions were paid to John Birt Productions, a company owned by Mr Birt and his wife Jane - this means that Mr Birt was paid more than had been thought. The actual total is difficult to discern because in addition to basic pay and pension money, Mr Birt's BBC expenses were also paid through the private company. In 1991, the last year for which accounts are available, the company's 'administration expenses' were Pounds 159,174. In that year there was a payment of Pounds 36,167 to the company pension plans. In January Mr Birt agreed a Pounds 200,000 pay package and the corporation has confirmed that he had formally joined the staff and would be eligible to join the BBC pension scheme. It is not clear whether the private pension payments will continue on top of the Pounds 200,000 package. BBC executives who know Mr Birt believe that the additional payments for his private pension are likely to continue in addition to his pay package.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Summary] "In a joint project of the National Bank of  Cambodia [NBC], the private banks are required to distribute 10  to 20 percent of their capital to the agricultural development  in Cambodia.    "Mr. Nuon Sam-an, deputy director of the NBC's Private Bank  Inspection Department, has said that the private banks have all  agreed to set aside a part of their banking capital as loans to  the farmers."    All 30 private commercial banks in Cambodia know that  Cambodia's national economy relies mainly on the agriculture.  They are waiting for the NBC to issue a law as a guarantee for  their loans.    Asked when the farmers will get the loans from private  banks,  the deputy director said that the NBC is arranging this law.  "He added, however, that the fund to be set aside will not  exceed 20 percent of each commercial bank's capital."    A term will be stated in this law that any private bank not  willing to deal directly with the farmers may give the loan to  the NBC by charging interest at the international rate.  Discussion is being carried out on whether 10 or 20 prcent of  the capital should be set aside. The NBC will be responsible  for the repayment if the loan is given through it.    Nuon Sam-an also said that the discussion on this law was  stalled when it came to the question on who should be  responsible for the repayment if the farmers fail to keep their  pledge. It is still not known when this law will be finalized.</p>

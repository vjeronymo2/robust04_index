			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The bad business of calumny"] </F>   [Excerpts] Ask any British businessman acquainted with  Malaysia about the outturn of events since February 20 and he  begins to groan like any other victim of Fleet Street  muck-churning. He laments the abject decline of the British  media, registers injury to his own interests, sympathy for the  innocent bystander -- Malaysia, and the sinking feeling that a  lot of hard work has been blown away by the grubby  scandalmongers of the British press. It is the conduct and  content of the painstaking effort at repairing economic  relations with Malaysia that has been impugned and now stands  poised to come to nought. The British businessman knows this  better than any other and has the biggest cause for regret.    Right through the 1980s and particularly following the Buy  British Last policy, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher headed a  diplomatic onslaught at the highest levels -- including frequent  meetings with Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed -- to rebuild and  restore Britain's commercial esteem in this country. She had a  big job in her hands -- not only were British interests in the  rear of a superior queue of foreign investment, they were also,  as part of Britain's waning industrial efficiency overall,  severely handicapped in their competitive ability. She had also  been rather desperate -- her country was in recession and  unemployment was growing. It was then that, while chasing a  considerable defence deal with Kuala Lumpur aid and arms sales  "became incorrectly entangled for a few months in 1988".    This lapse, according to British Foreign Secretary Douglas  Hurd testifying in parliament last Wednesday, was hastily  corrected afterwards, and the whole package eventually went  through. Malaysia, as fastidious customer, made its choice after  intense lobbying and considerable "sweetening", including  tie-up's as well as cheap credits and aid, swung its appraisal  in favour of British products. Such government-to-government  dealmaking goes on worldwide and, in democratic countries, is  accountable in parliament. At no time were individual Malaysian  decisionmakers greased over the composition of the eventual  contracts and supply package -- that was left to the wisdom of  the British Government, and its enthusiasm to help its own  industries.    Aid-donating countries, including Britain, have been in the  habit of "tying" aid-for-trade deals for years, often diluting  the benefit of the aid to the recipient country. That Whitehall  had fixed things in order to put together a winnable tender bid  ought not to have been so grudgingly divulged upon inquiry as to  whet the appetite of a vulturous press. [passage omitted]  Malaysia wishes to protect its integrity against such  defamations of a blimpish, contemptuous foreign press as well as  against a government which curiously chooses to remain apathetic  to the dignity of nation it so avidly desires to deal with. The  Malaysian Government cannot pretend business-as-usual with  regard to a fellow governnent which is almost certain to leave  every business deal prone to calumny at some time to come.</p>

			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Judgment day over Pounds 1.8bn bid - The battle surrounding Lloyds' offer for C&amp;G Few, if any, of those with a ringside seat for the legal fight between the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society and the Building Societies Commission over Lloyds Bank's agreed Pounds 1.8bn bid for C&amp;G believe that the High Court's judgment will be the end of the affair. The two days of hearings before Sir Donald Nicholls, the vice-chancellor, revealed fundamentally different approaches by C&amp;G and its statutory regulator to the relevant provisions of the 1986 Building Societies Act. The gulf was summed up by Mr Jonathan Sumption QC, counsel for C&amp;G: 'There are a number of features which are anathema to the Building Societies Commission but which to us are entirely proper features of the trans-action.' In addition, the stakes for each side are so high that whichever falls at the first hurdle can scarcely afford to leave the matter there. For C&amp;G, Mr Sumption argued that the act was not a comprehensive code of regulation for the transfer of a society's business to a successor company. Counsel for the Building Societies Commission, Mr Phillip Heslop QC, said that since societies were creatures of statute, their powers were limited to what legislation specifically stated or necessarily implied they could do. Within these diametrically opposed approaches, three main points were at issue: could anyone except the society and its successor be a party to the transfer of its business? could a payment be made in relation to a transfer that was not expressly allowed by the relevant part of the act? assuming a third party could make a payment, could this benefit members of a society of less than two years' standing, who would not be allowed to share in a distribution of funds under a transfer agreement which clearly fell within the legislation? Mr Sumption said that the draft transfer agreement in the Lloyds/C&amp;G transaction included terms agreed between the society and its successor company which covered all the issues the legislation required. The fact that the same matters had been agreed with others as well did not mean that the agreement did not comply with the 1986 act. The commission's argument, however, was that in referring to an agreement between the society and its successor on the terms of the transfer, the legislation meant that nothing integral to the transfer could be agreed with anyone else. As for the question of a payment not expressly allowed by the act, Mr Sumption argued that if Parliament had wanted to control the actions of a third party, it would have had to create a more elaborate scheme than it had done. For example, the legislation did not provide any sanction against a third party which handed out benefits to a society's members. Debates in Parliament on the bill had not mentioned third parties, and no-one could know what Parliament might have thought of third-party payments. However, Mr Heslop argued that the detailed provisions about what societies could do - even to the extent of explicitly allowing them to acquire premises and make loans for mobile homes - showed the act was based on having to give societies express powers to carry out activities. The consultation and discussion on the proposed legislation before it finally became law reinforced the argument that the idea of transferring a society's business to a successor was intended to be only a limited exception to the previous blanket prohibition on such a move, he said. It is on the two-year restriction on payments that the dispute is most critical. The terms proposed by Lloyds would involve cash payments of up to Pounds 10,000 to all saving and borrowing members of the society, as well as depositors, employees and pensioners. The voting thresholds set in the legislation for members of a society to approve a transfer are so high that, without support from at least some of the 27 per cent of C&amp;G's shareholding members who are of less then two years' standing, there is no prospect of achieving approval. Mr Sumption admitted that Parliament had intended the act to prevent members' taking decisions on the basis of short-term financial gains and to prevent speculative flows between societies on rumours of takeovers. He argued, however, that the primary defence against this was the high voting thresholds themselves. Though the act prevented relatively new members benefiting from a distribution of a society's funds, it did not necessarily follow that Parliament thought this restriction should apply when 'new' money from another organisation was being handed out, he added. For the Commission, however, Mr Heslop said Parliament could not have intended that a transaction would be able to avoid having to comply with the regime set out in the act, simply by a relatively modest structuring of a deal to involve a third party. Such easy circumvention of what were intended to be safeguards to prevent the destabilising of the building society movement by speculative flows would mean that compliance was 'optional', he said. Given such deep divisions, Sir Donald's judgment, to be given tomorrow at 5pm, looks likely to trigger an application for leave to appeal. The losing side may seek to take its case all the way to the House of Lords. Even when the courtroom drama has finished, that will not necessarily be the end of the argument. If the commission loses, the Building Societies Association will rush round to the Treasury to urge the reinstatement of the two-year restriction on payments to society members. Mr Brian Pitman, Lloyds' chief executive, has already said that the whole deal would have to be looked at again if C&amp;G lost. In the meantime, there would be hundreds of thousands of C&amp;G customers who might feel aggrieved that the cash windfalls they had been expecting had been taken from them. 'I imagine many customers might want to write to their MPs, complaining,' one senior figure on the Lloyds/C&amp;G team mused. Whatever the outcome, the battle that began in private discussions between the society and the commission looks set to end in the Commons, not in the courts.</p>

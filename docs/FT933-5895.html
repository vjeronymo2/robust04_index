			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / People: Bethnal Green City Challenge Lesley Klein and Michael Bear (left) have recently joined one of the City's more unusual boards, that of Bethnal Green City Challenge, one of 20 nationwide city challenge organisations set up by the department of the environment to rejuvenate Britain's dilapidated inner-cities. Bethnal Green's version is 18 months into its Pounds 35m five-year programme. As chief executive, Klein, an accountant by training, is engaged full-time on a variety of projects, while Bear, chairman, is on secondment (one day a week) from his post as managing director of BICC Developments, the property arm of the BICC Group. The City Challenge organisations are a peculiar mixture of public money and private sector volunteer work. In Bethnal Green, says Klein, one of the biggest challenges is to integrate more fully its large Bangladeshi community into the life and work of the area. 'We are a stone's throw from the City. We can see the wealth it has but the local ethnic communities here are inspired by that, they have a very commercial and entrepreneurial attitude,' says Klein. Like many others they are praying for an upturn in the property market; one of the biggest projects - currently on hold - is a planned rejuvenation of the Albion brewery site in Whitechapel which it is planned will house a new superstore for the retailer J. Sainsbury.</p>

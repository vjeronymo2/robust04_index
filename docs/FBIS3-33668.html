A cultural association representing Algeria's original  Berber  inhabitants, from whom the RCD draws its support, blamed the  "odious crime" on "terrorists" in a statement.    Tigziri was the first national official of a political party  to be murdered since armed Islamic fundamentalists began waging  a guerrilla war against the state two years ago. Numerous  intellectuals have been assassinated as part of a campaign of  fear.    The attackers slit Tigziri's throat as he was heading for  his  car outside the building in Bach Djarah, one of the strongholds  of Islamic fundamentalism in the region around the capital.    Formerly a senior civil servant at the Ministry of Labour,  Tigziri had been economics spokesman for the RCD, led by Said  Sadi. Tigziri, 42, was married and had no children.    "Algeria has again lost one of its finest sons, an activist  for all the democratic causes," the Berber cultural grouping Si  Muhand U Mhend said in its statement, adding that the  association would "remain mobilised" and that "republican  Algeria will win."    Tens of thousands of Berber people have held demonstrations  in towns in the Kabylie region this month to protest against the  Muslim extremist violence as well as what they presented as  repression of their culture by the authorities.</p>

			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> RAIDERS;  </P> <P> BELL UNCONCERNED BY BO'S ARRIVAL  </P> <P> Running back Greg Bell said he's not worried about Bo Jackson's arrival, even  if it does figure to cut into his playing time.  </P> <P> "For some reason, people forget that I piled up a lot of yards over the last  two years," he said.  </P> <P> "So why would I be concerned with that?"  </P> <P> Bell is out with a right ankle sprain suffered in Sunday's 24-17 victory over  the Seattle Seahawks. He is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against the  San Diego Chargers. Raider Coach Art Shell said Bell may be placed on injured  reserve.  </P> <P> Defensive end Howie Long and offensive tackle Bruce Wilkerson returned to  practice. Long was on injured reserve since Week 2 with a broken right foot.  Wilkerson has been out all season with a knee injury. Shell said he will wait a  few days before making a decision whether Long will play against San Diego.  CHRIS DUFRESNE  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Ze'ev Schiff: "A Mistaken Formula for </F> Negotiations"]    [Text] Israel's formula for negotiations with Syria, as  expounded by Rabin, "The depth of withdrawal will equal the  depth of peace," is fundamentally and tactically flawed. It  means that if al-Asad agrees to full peace, Israel will be  committed to full withdrawal with all this entails. On the face  of it this is fine, but in fact it poses obstacles on Israel's  negotiating path.    Al-Asad claims he has already made his move when he publicly  and privately declared in President Clinton's presence in Geneva  that Syria has made a strategic decision to seek peace. Even  though he did not enter the details, the Syrians claim he meant  full peace. He is willing to discuss the stages leading to  peace, but the basic decision has already been publicly stated.  Al-Asad claims it is now Rabin's turn to reciprocate according  to the stipulations of the Israeli formula. If full peace is  intended, Rabin must complete the formula by stating: Full  withdrawal. According to al-Asad it will be possible to discuss  the security arrangements which the two sides require at a later  stage. The Syrians claim, however, that Rabin has retracted and  is unwilling to implement his formula.    I believe Israel's attitude should have been different.  Israel should have presented a different formula: The depth of  withdrawal will equal the depth of the security arrangements!  According to this formula, for example, if al-Asad demands to  limit the size of the demilitarized zone, then the depth of  Israeli withdrawal will also be limited. If al-Asad is opposed,  for example, to Israeli-manned warning stations on the Golan  Heights, then the progress and stages of Israeli withdrawal will  be prolonged by years. If al-Asad unequivocally rejects border  modifications, Israel will demand to maintain the warning  stations for a longer duration. The internal link between the  depth of withdrawal and security arrangements will enable Israel  to conduct the negotiations from a more convenient position.  According to this formula peace is self-evident and above  argument. The only argument will revolve around the security  arrangements, a position which will be very easy to explain to  the Israelis and the U.S. mediator. For many Israelis peace  primarily means security for them and for Israel.    We are being informed by spokesmen and the media that Israel  and Syria have already made significant progress during  Christopher's recent visit. This progress in the negotiations  with Syria should have been made during September, prior to the  Oslo agreement. At that time it was concluded that the  negotiations will be held at the highest level, between Rabin  and al-Asad with Christopher as mediator. Now we have reached  that stage again, and even though we are not talking here about  direct negotiations between the two leaders, a higher level of  contacts has been attained. However, this is not enough for  completing the complicated negotiations on many sensitive issues  between two countries which have been at war for dozens of years.    The gap between the sides is still profound and we must not  harbor any illusions that the negotiations will be easy. It is  more likely that we will witness serious crises before a  breakthrough is made. Al-Asad and Rabin are known to be tough  negotiators. Both of them want this reputation of toughness to  be justified and vindicated. They have experience in  negotiating with one another from 1974. During Christopher's  last visit, the two sides entered the stage of preliminary  clarifications, each seeking the other side's clarifications on  the issues of normalization and the withdrawal stages. This  stage was preceded by various declarations, with Rabin being the  one who made the more significant move in his statement  regarding Golan Heights settlements.    Al-Asad is still concentrating on the method of  negotiations,  namely on how to take the best advantage of the U.S. mediator.  This is not a simple issue for al-Asad, and not only because  Washington is suspicious of Syria (due to its support of  terrorism and drug dealing) and is behaving unfairly toward it,  as the Syrian president maintains. Al-Asad's associates say  that the Syrian president believes that Washington is in  Israel's pocket. Even if we are dealing here with an extremely  supportive U.S. Administration, however, this does not mean that  Israel is dictating things to Washington. Al-Asad, however,  does not want to forfeit the possibility of a more intensive  involvement of the U.S. mediator (he also has no choice). He  correctly surmises that Washington is unlikely to exert heavy  pressure on Israel to make more concessions and to disregard its  vital interests.    Al-Asad will henceforth focus on demanding intensive  negotiations in which Christopher will serve as a traveling  mediator. Al-Asad has still not reached the stage in which he  will ask the United States for any recompense. Even though he  would have preferred mediators of the like of Kissinger and  James Baker, he has to adjust to the present mediator, who  strikes him as being too soft. Al-Asad expects to reach the  stage in which President Clinton himself will intervene. His  mere presence will exert pressure on Israel, which will not want  to prevent the friendly President from scoring an achievement.  As long as we have not reached this stage, al-Asad will not  agree to hold a meeting with Rabin. Such a meeting will take  place if Rabin suddenly decides to make a grand concession, or  when the two meet with President Clinton at a very advanced  stage of the negotiations.</p>

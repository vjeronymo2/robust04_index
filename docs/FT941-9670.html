			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Record deficit for German export credit programme The German government's export credit insurance programme, Hermes, suffered its worst ever deficit last year. The shortfall of DM5.1bn (Pounds 2bn) is more than twice that of 1992 and is mainly due to DM4.5bn of losses on high-risk business with the former Soviet Union. The economics ministry said it might eventually recover some of the losses if and when Russia and Germany agreed on a full-scale debt rescheduling. But in the meantime the loss will be booked to Germany's public sector deficit. Defending the decision to maintain its Hermes export insurance on exports to Russia, despite the risks, the ministry said it had been necessary to help businesses in the eastern part of Germany survive the collapse of traditional markets in the former eastern bloc. 'Our continued coverage for the countries of the former Soviet Union has made an important contribution to the maintenance of production and employment in eastern Germany,' the ministry said. It was in the government's interests to have healthy businesses in the east, the ministry added, and the maintenance of the export credits via the Hermes programme had helped companies gradually adapt to opportunities in western markets while carrying on their trade with the former Soviet Union. Last year, the government limited credit guarantees to Russia to DM5bn, giving priority to east German exporters, a figure reduced further to DM3.5bn for the current year. The Hermes scheme, a key instrument of the German government's policy for promoting exports, has produced a loss every year since 1982.</p>

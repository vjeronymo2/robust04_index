In the following recording,  you will hear an assessment of this forum given by Birkavs at  the airport right after he returned to Riga:    [Begin Birkavs recording] Defining the Baltic lands in  Europe  and the world...in fact, one must conclude that what the  previous economic forums defined--declaring in 1973 that they  were going from fixed to floating exchange rates in the  world--that this is the end of the economic consequences of  World War II. And in 1989, when the Singing Revolution and all  other kinds of revolutions began in Europe, they declared that  that was the end of the political consequences of World War II.  Neither the economic nor the political consequences of World  War II have, in fact, been liquidated, and, in this sense, the  Baltic question is one of those consequences of World War II  that have not been liquidated. This was very  significant--especially because it was not a Baltic seminar, but  a Baltic-Nordic one, and this is where we were linked.    The question of Baltic unity: It was a fairly fundamental  emphasis to demonstrate our unity even though Russia was trying  to introduce a certain dissonance, for which perhaps there is  some small basis. And there was talk from the rostrum that only  two countries, Estonia and Latvia, have developed in a direction  that distances them ever further from Russia. Lithuania is  bound by its policies more to Russia. At the World Economic  Forum, nearly all the conversations ended, one way or another,  with Russia. The world is concerned about Russia's future  because the high inflation [words indistinct] and the view that  the ultimate result will lead to some sort of cataclysm, the  prognosis for which at the moment is relatively difficult. In  practice, we have felt the clearly expressed view from  everywhere that we have gone quite far. Four countries have  distanced themselvesa from Russia more: the Czech Republic,  Hungary, Estonia, and Latvia. Estonia is being described as the  locomotive of central and eastern Europe, with the most rapid  development.</p>

			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / International Company News: Heinz raises payout and plans to buy back shares Shares in HJ Heinz, the US food group headed by Mr Tony O'Reilly, the Irish businessman, rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 37 1/2 yesterday after the company lifted its quarterly dividend by 9 per cent to 36 cents and announced that it would buy back a further 10m of its shares. Heinz's stock price has been under a cloud following the company's poor financial performance in the year ending April 1994. But yesterday Mr O'Reilly told the company's annual meeting that Heinz was 'back on track to deliver double-digit growth in annual earnings in the 1990s'. Mr O'Reilly said one significant area of growth would be baby foods. According to a Reuters news agency report, he told journalists after the meeting that Heinz's board had approved the acquisition of another baby food company in Europe. Earlier this year Heinz bought the Farley's baby food line from Boots, the UK retailing and pharmaceutical group. This came shortly after it had agreed with Glaxo, the UK pharmaceuticals group, to buy Glaxo's baby food line in India. However, Mr O'Reilly said Heinz's future growth would result from a combination of higher volume, cost reduction, price increases, stock repurchases, acquisitions and global expansion.</p>

			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / International Company News: Loral group wins battle for LTV unit THE BIDDING war for the missiles and aircraft unit of LTV Corporation, the bankrupt steel company, yesterday ended in victory for the Dollars 475m bid from a group composed of Loral Corporation, Carlyle Group - an investment banking firm - and Northrop, the defence contractor. After a lengthy hearing in the Manhattan bankruptcy courts yesterday afternoon, Judge Burton Lifland - overseeing the LTV bankruptcy - said that he was willing to accept the Loral group's offer. His endorsement came after a long recess in which final details of the offer were hammered out. It also followed submissions from representatives of various LTV creditors - including the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the federal agency which underpins pension benefits and LTV's largest creditor - that the Loral group's bid was the highest and best offer on the table. Creditors had been confronted by a rival offer from Martin Marietta, another US defence contractor. This offer, however, remained at Dollars 440m yesterday - although terms were adjusted to offer Dollars 425m in cash and the remaining Dollars 15m in preferred stock. Judge Lifland declined to allow a Dollars 10m payment to Martin Marietta if its offer was topped by a better bid, but he did acknowledge that the unsuccessful suitor had played an important role in the sale process. He said he would permit a smaller Dollars 5m payment. The auction of the missile and aircraft businesses represents the final throes of the LTV bankruptcy, which has dragged on for over five years.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with People's Deputy Viktor Pynzenyk by Yevheniya </F> Romaniv, labelled as an exclusive interview under the rubric  "The Economy"; place and date not given: " `Any Curved Line Is  Shorter Than the Straight Line Leading Past a Superior' "--first  paragraph is ZA VILNU UKRAYINU introduction]    [Text] Our ill-fated economy has been left in the lurch.  Our legislators are busy fighting to retain their seats as  deputies for another term, while our civil servants are taking  advantage of the absence of controls to do as they please,  leaving people to wonder whether they are really as incompetent  with respect to the laws of economics as they appear or  deliberately bent on utterly destroying the economy. This  situation in Ukraine was the subject of our discussion with  People's Deputy Viktor Pynzenyk.    [Romaniv] Mr. Pynzenyk, what do you think the government's  next decision will be?    [Pynzenyk] When I was asked this question in Washington, I  joked that it would be the nationalization of women. The point I  was trying to make was that the present cabinet's actions are  absolutely unpredictable. Take, for example, the telegram signed  by Acting Deputy Prime Minister Yu. Zvyahilskyy and V.  Yushchenko, the chairman of the board of directors of the  National Bank of Ukraine, prohibiting banks from issuing  credits. Imagine for a moment that the banks had actually  carried out this directive--in reality, they had enough sense  not to comply. Had they stopped issuing credits for even a week,  production would have been completely paralyzed owing to a lack  of working capital and the fact that it would have been  impossible to obtain accounts receivable financing. Would the  financial situation have improved as a result? There would have  been a new jump in prices, an even greater shortage of goods,  and a larger hole in the budget. This is not only the view from  Lviv, the view of a professor and theoretician, as I am being  called. In a recent speech in parliament, Mr. Melnyk, an  industrialist who is the director of the Novomoskovsk pipe  plant, described the government's actions as contributing to the  collapse of the economy. But then every director and every  worker will tell you the same thing.    [Romaniv] Do you intend to return to the government?    [Pynzenyk] Only if it works as a team. I have personal  experience working in an ill-assorted cabinet. I had never  imagined politics to be such a dirty business. I think that one  of the government's problems is its poor relations with the  deputies. Most deputies do not read the drafts of decisions; if  these acts were explained to the deputies, they could be counted  on to support them. Many matters in the Supreme Council are  decided in the smoking room, but one has to be present there.  Government officials need to come more often to the delegations  and the parliamentarians to the government officials.    Many good decisions were passed while I was a member of the  Cabinet of Ministers, but we were not able to supplement them  and put in place the necessary mechanisms. As a result, some  decrees proved ineffective.    [Romaniv] On the other hand, many of the government's other  actions succeeded in doing their dirty work--they drove  production into a blind alley. Given the authority, what would  be the first things you would propose to improve the fundamental  laws governing the economy?    [Pynzenyk] As you can see, the first not to survive the  torture was the financial system--it virtually died. Reviving  the state's economic organism requires an infusion of new blood.  In economic terms, this means money. But the existing credit  policy is not capable of curing the situation. Here is why: the  banks offer an interest rate of 300 percent to enterprises and  individuals on their deposits and extend loans at 600 percent.  But do not rush to condemn them for setting overly high interest  rates on credit. To borrow money at this rate, you also have to  give the bank a good bribe. Let us do some calculating: I  borrowed one billion karbovantsi and bought goods, the price of  which increased 65-fold in a year. Thus, without doing anything,  I have 65 billion karbovantsi. I repay the bank 7 billion  officially (the one billion I borrowed and six billion in  interest) and of the remaining profit of 58 billion, I give the  bank something unofficially, either because we had a gentleman's  agreement to that effect, or because I understand that business  has to stay on good terms with such a wealthy outfit. Given this  situation, why spend money investing in production when one can  prosper engaging in such middleman operations?    Thus, the cheaper the price of credit from the National  Bank,  the greater the profits that sit in commercial banks and the  faster the pace at which the business of speculation grows fat.  What do we need to do to make such middleman operations less  profitable? The interest rate on such credit must be the same as  the rate of inflation. This will make it unprofitable for me to  hold on to goods, because I will have to give back everything I  make selling them in interest to the bank. This will also solve  the financial problem, because funds will be saved and invested  in the production sector.    I would also recommend that credits be issued mainly through  auctions. And only when secured by property. The flaw in the  command-sectorial allocation of finances is best described by  the army expression that any curved line is shorter than the  straight line leading past a superior. You know, when I was  demonstratively resigning from the government, one official said  to me in a conciliatory fashion: "If you want, we'll divide up  the currency together." That is not what I want. Because  whenever the dividing up is being done by a civil servant,  something always sticks to his hands. There is always someone  who must be accomodated first, always someone who wants much  more and is prepared to split a portion of what he gets.  Currency should be divided up by those who can afford to buy it.    But the market system of advancing credit will produce no  results without free prices. There is no need to fear  liberalizing them when credit flows are restricted. Why are  people opposed to the liberalization of prices? Because they do  not understand what this means. The prices of goods are rising  because the flow of freshly printed money is not restricted in  any way. Last year, for example, the money supply increased  severalfold. When the printing of money is restricted,  expenditures are also placed under control and prices stabilize  as a result. If prices do not cover costs, bankruptcy ensues.  This financial insolvency makes it necessary to change owners.    This brings us to privatization. This should be started--by  force, if necessary. But as part of a package involving the  destatization of the distribution of circulation and trade. This  is especially important in the current conditions of  hyperinflation. After all, the revaluations of goods are not  producing the expected results, because large sums of money are  moving from state to private pockets. A seller, knowing that the  price of cigarettes will double tomorrow, will pay for them  today and sell them tomorrow, pocketing the difference. As long  as there are two pockets--one belonging to the state and the  other to private individuals--trade will remain in disarray.  Such machinations make no sense in a private store.    These are the problems on which I would like to work in  parliament--I plan to run again in the coming election--as well  as in the government, if it is a reformist and market-oriented  government.</p>

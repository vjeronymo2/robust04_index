			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 11 (YONHAP) -- Japan will assume all its  required responsibilities when the U.N. Security Council decides  on sanctions against North Korea, Seiji Morimoto, Japanese  Foreign Ministry spokesman, said Saturday. Japan, South Korea  and the United States did not discuss sanctions outside the  United Nations at the tripartite talks in Washington, he said.    Morimoto gave a press conference at the end of talks between  Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa and his South Korean  counterpart Han Sung-chu. Kakizawa, who flew into Seoul earlier  Saturday, called on President Kim Yong-sam.    "The Japanese Government did not discuss specifics on  sanctions against North Korea so far," said Morimoto, "but we  are discussing the purpose of the sanctions and how to go about  it within a big framework."    The spokesman, as did Kakizawa, denied reports that Tokyo  was  passive about the sanctions.    Asked about possibility of Japan's rearmament caused by  North  Korea's nuclear development, Morimoto reminded that Japan is the  sole victim of a nuclear bomb. He said Japan will strictly  adhere to its three principles -- not to develop, possess or  introduce nuclear weapons.    On groups of Japanese Socialist Party lawmakers visiting  North Korea, Morimoto said they are irrelevant to the stance of  the Japanese Government. "It is a matter entirely up to each,  individual lawmaker," he said.</p>

			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Baltic rises from wreckage: The return of trading to the bombed exchange TRADING at London's historic Baltic Exchange resumes early next month, just less than a year after an IRA bomb wrecked the London shipping market's headquarters. The Baltic has emerged from the disaster - in which three people were killed and dozens injured - as a much smaller institution. Managers have been forced to slash the scale of back-up operations it provides, reducing staff by two thirds. Complete restoration of the 91-year-old, grade 2 listed building - one of the City's best known landmarks - could take a further three years. Mr Jim Buckley, the Baltic's chief executive, says, 'It has not been an entirely happy experience. In fact it has been a nightmare.' Mr Buckley took seven months to negotiate a Pounds 27.6m insurance settlement. Although there is enough money to cover repair work and many other costs, Mr Buckley says the insurance was insufficient to cover the entire cost of the disrupt-ion. The ordeal started last April when the building's facade took the full force of the bomb blast. Pieces of Swedish granite and carved Portland stone were hurled through the building's lavish interior. Steel columns clad in Italian and Greek marble, nine glass domes, including a central dome 40ft in diameter, moulded bronze chandeliers, stained-glass windows and a 23,000 sq ft Rhodesian walnut trading floor all sustained heavy damage. Ironically, trading was barely affected. Brokers who buy and sell space on ships for bulk cargoes ranging from oil to phosphate, and from grain to sugar, improvised in the first few days after the explosion and within a week had rented alternative premises at the nearby Lloyd's of London insurance market. Mr Buckley says it was merely a 'hiccup' in trading, which generates about Dollars 1.4bn a year in commission income. However, the impact on the exchange, its staff and the small businesses associated with it has been far more severe. Because so many of the small offices surrounding the trading floor were destroyed, the exchange's annual income of Pounds 5m a year was immediately halved by the loss of Pounds 2.5m a year in rent. 'We have been out of the building a lot longer than we had expected,' Mr Buckley says. 'The insurance wasn't going to cover all our costs.' He has set aside Pounds 7 1/2 m of the Pounds 27.6m settlement to meet that loss over the next three years. A further Pounds 1m covered the cost of a year's rental income at Lloyd's, while the immediate clean-up and refurbishment have cost about Pounds 3m. That leaves just Pounds 15m to carry out essential rebuilding work, and although the sum will be enough to restore the building to grade 2 status, there will be insufficient cash to rebuild the 110,000 sq ft of office space. 'We have had to husband our resources carefully on behalf of our members,' says Mr Buckley, who was forced to dismiss 100 of the exchange's 150 staff last May. Many of the small businesses which surrounded the exchange - the Italian sandwich shop next door, the wine bar and the restaurants, and the gym in the basement - have little hope of being re-established. 'There is a bitter and human side of the story,' Mr Buckley concludes.</p>

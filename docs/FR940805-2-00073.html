CHANGED Procedures_Effective Date: Services Furnished on or   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After 12/21/92.   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 50&hyph;5, Thermography._This section excludes from coverage the use of thermography for all indications. Do not open previously processed claims. However, if individual claims are brought to your attention, reopen and process them retroactively to December 21, 1992.   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 50&hyph;5 Thermography (Effective for services performed on and after December 21, 1992.   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thermography is the measurement of self-emanating infrared radiation that reveals temperature variations at the surface of the body. The thermographic device senses body temperature and demonstrates areas of differing heat emission by producing brightly colored patterns. Each color represents a specific temperature level. Interpretation of these color patterns according to designated anatomic distribution is thought to aid in diagnosing a vast array of diseases.   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thermography for any indication (including breast lesions which were excluded from Medicare coverage on July 20, 1984) is excluded from Medicare coverage because the available evidence does not support this test as a useful aid in the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury. Therefore, it is not considered effective. This exclusion was published as a HCFA Final Notice in the Federal Register on November 20, 1992.   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transmittal No. 67; Section, 60&hyph;14, Infusion Pumps. CHANGED Implementing Instruction_Effective Date: For services performed on or after 03/04/94.   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 60&hyph;14, Infusion Pumps, has been revised to provide for coverage of implantable infusion pumps for use in the treatment of spasticity and chronic intractable pain of malignant or nonmalignant origin, if specified patient selection criteria are met.   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This section has also been revised to permit coverage of other uses of an implantable infusion pump if the pump is being used to administer a drug that is included as an indicated use on the pump's approved labelling and the contractor's medical staff determines that such is reasonable and necessary for an individual patient.   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> 60&hyph;14&blank;Infusion Pumps   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Following Indications For Treatment Using Infusion Pumps Are Covered Under Medicare:   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A.

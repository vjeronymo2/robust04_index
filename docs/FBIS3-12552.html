It is a poor response to the new  emerging compulsions of the post-cold war era as well as to new  opportunities and the search for a possible reversal of the  decades long arms race in South Asia. Above all it hardly helps  those in Pakistan genuinely desirous of achieving a better  equilibrium between its requirements of legitimate defence and  development needs. If India, which is already spending more  than dollars six billion on defence continues to feel insecure  internally and externally, notwithstanding its huge size and  relatively much more developed industrial base, how can Pakistan  lower its guards with a more sensitive strategic location, lack  of depth and limited industrial potential. India's proposed  military spending of dollars 7.6 billion for the new fiscal year  is up by dollars 1.27 billion and covers much than what is  justifiable by its inflation rate of 8.5 percent. The  substantial new increase is reportedly the highest since 1986-87  when it recorded the highest jump of over 31 percent. On the  whole the military spending maintains the tempo introduced into  it since 1982-83. Apart from the three services, the border  security force has also a higher allocation.    In its other features the Indian budget now indicates a new  flexibility to break the rigid postures of the past few decades  and respond more energetically to the new economic changes of  the day. Indian finance minister has eased access to foreign  exchange in a bid to move towards a full float of the Indian  rupee. Domestic industry is being exposed to greater foreign  competition by reducing custom duties on imports. Taxable  incomes now have higher exemption limit while corporate tax rate  has been substantially lowered. Credit will also be cheap with  the banks lending rated slashed. But the lowering of external  tariff has been balanced by some concessions to domestic  industry to pull it out of the recession of the past two years.  Such measures undoubtedly will further reinforce the process of  the profound economic change set in motion in India since 1991  to open its economy to foreign investors. Whether India can  execute the process of the market-oriented economic reforms and  achieve a balanced socioeconomic growth without containing her  military spending is an open question. But Pakistani planners  and economic policy makers need to closely monitor India's new  moves to put it on the global investment radar screen, as  emphasised by an Indian official recently. For a long time we  have been used to superficial comparison of ours and the Indian  economy. In a changing international and regional environment  it is necessary to shed a complacent view and develop a more  informed and critical understanding of the economic changes in  India.</p>

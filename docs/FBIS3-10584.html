			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In Port-au-Prince, the Carrefour-Feuilles Platform  [Plateforme de Carrefour-Feuilles] organization criticized the  attitude of some FNCD [National Front for Change and Democracy]  legislators who gave their support to the plan approved by the  legislators. The Carrefour-Feuilles Platform condemns the  decision of the CONACOM [National Congress of Democratic  Movements] secretary general who supported the legislators'  plan.    [Begin unidentified speaker recording] This plan is one way  for the State Department, Victor Benoit, the Army, and the  macoutes to extinguish all the hopes that the 16 December and 20  January elections brought the Haitian people. We are  criticizing all the FNCD legislators who let Victor Benoit and  the State Department buy them in order to sell out the country  so that repression and beatings replace democracy in the  country. We call those legislators Lavalas traitors with no  conviction. The Carrefour-Feuilles Platform is astonished to  see that lust for power made Victor Benoit forget all the  CONACOM militants who were killed during the coup d'etat.    Who is to say that they were were not accomplices in the  killing of those militants! The State Department should either  officially support the criminals or the return of Aristide and  democracy to the country. Our words are our convictions in the  Carrefour-Feuilles Platform. [end recording].</p>

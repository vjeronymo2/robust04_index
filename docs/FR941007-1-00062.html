			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Strategic Plan Assessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The December proposal would have provided that, as an alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to being rated under the lending, service, and investment tests, or the small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution assessment standards, an institution could submit to its supervisory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency for approval a strategic plan detailing how the institution proposed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meet its CRA obligation. The December proposal would have required that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plan be submitted three months in advance of its effective date, and that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution solicit public comment on the plan at the time the plan is submitted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the agency. No plan would have been approved unless it provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measurable goals for proposed performance and those goals constituted at least  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfactory performance under the standards of the regulation. No plan could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have had a term beyond two years, and the institution could have petitioned the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency to amend the plan on the grounds that a material change of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances made the plan no longer appropriate. The agency would have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessed the CRA performance of the institution under the plan. If the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution failed to meet or exceed the preponderance of its goals, its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance would have been evaluated against the lending, service and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investment tests or the small institution assessment method, as applicable. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preamble to the December proposal stated that an institution operating under an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved strategic plan would not be relieved of its obligation to report data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The concerns regarding the strategic plan option most consistently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> raised by the comments were the December proposal's lack of details  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerning important aspects of how the plan option would operate and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nature of public input into the process. The revised proposal would provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantially more detail about the operation of the plan option than the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> December proposal, and would modify the December proposal in other respects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as well. In the revised proposal, the agencies have attempted to provide a real  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative to the standard lending, investment, and service tests through the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strategic plan option, while assuring that those operating under a plan are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to a CRA assessment that is no less stringent and performance-based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than the proposed standard tests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The revised proposal would substantially revise the provisions in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the December proposal regarding public participation in the plan process. An  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution would be required to informally seek suggestions from the public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> while developing the plan. Once the institution had developed the plan, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution would be required to formally solicit public comment on the plan for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at least 30 days. The agencies have decided not to extend the minimum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment period to avoid unduly lengthening the plan process. After the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment period, the institution would submit the plan to its regulator, along  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with any comments received, and, if the plan was revised in light of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments received, the plan in the form released for public comment. Under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the revised proposal, a submitted plan would be approved if the agency fails to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> act on the plan within 60 days after submission, unless the agency extended the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review period for good cause. Until a plan was approved, an institution would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be subject to the standard performance tests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These changes would increase the opportunity for productive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> community input in the plan process. By requiring an institution to seek  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> informal suggestions in formulating a plan, and then to solicit formal comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before submitting a plan to the agency, this process will encourage consultation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between an institution and its community, including local government,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> community leaders, and the public. There would not be a further comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period after the institution submits its proposed plan to the agency because such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a comment period could undermine the direct communication and consultation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between an institution and its community that is most beneficial to the process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The revised proposal would provide that, in evaluating a plan, the agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would consider the public's involvement in formulating the plan and any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> response by the institution to public comment on the plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several comments appeared to misunderstand why the strategic plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would provide for input from the public. The plan option would provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions an opportunity to tailor their CRA objectives to the needs of their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> community and their capacity and expertise. Few comments suggested that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution would be able to determine the needs of its community without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consulting in some fashion with those in the community. Several industry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments were concerned that under the strategic plan option, community  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organizations would play an inappropriate role in an institution's operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the purpose of the consultation would be for the institution to develop  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information about the needs of its community and how they might be met so  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that it can make better judgments when formulating its plan objectives. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision regarding how the institution is to meet those needs would remain with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution. In reviewing the public participation, the agencies would not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider whether community organizations unanimously supported the plan, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether the institution made an appropriate investigation to determine the needs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of its community, and whether, considering the information about community  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credit needs that the institution received in the comments, the plan goals are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate. The agencies would evaluate strategic plans and their proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measurable goals in the assessment context against which the tests and standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the proposed regulation would be applied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

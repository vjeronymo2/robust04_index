			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / International Company News: HungarHotels contenders line up American General Hospitality, a privately-held US company, and Intercontinental Hotels, the Japanese-owned hotel group, last night emerged as the top contenders for a 51 per cent stake in HungarHotels, Hungary's last state-owned hotel chain to come up for privatisation. The State Property Agency, the privatisation body, said three of the five companies invited to participate in yesterday's tender had put in valid bids. Analysts said American General, which operates 91 hotels in the US, and Intercontinental, which has wide experience in the former Soviet bloc, were the favourites to win. HungarHotels has registered share capital of Ft9bn (USDollars 83.3m) but the sale of the 51 per cent stake is expected to net around USDollars 60m. HungarHotels owns 15 hotels in Hungary, including eight in Budapest and two on Lake Balaton, the country's most popular summer tourist destination. It owns 45 per cent of four star hotel capacity in Budapest, including the Hotel Forum situated on the River Danube in the centre of the city which is one of central Europe's most visited tourist and business locations. The chain made net profit of Ft6.3bn last year and is projecting net profit of Ft6.6bn for 1994. Room occupancy averaged 53.7 per cent last year and is expected to increase to 57 per cent this year. Dallas-based American General, which was founded in 1981, has a track record in turning around loss-making or under performing hotels. The company, which had turnover of USDollars 300m last year, does not operate hotels under its own name but appoints franchise partners for its hotels. In the US, it works with chains such as Marriott, Sheraton, Hilton and Holiday Inn. The company said it believed its management could add 'a lot of value' to HungarHotels and that it was keen to establish a presence in the European market. Presently, the company only operates in the US. Intercontinental has worked in the region since the 1960s. It runs the Hotel Forum through a local franchiser and until last year had a similar agreement with the Duna Intercontinental, now the Marriott. Intercontinental said, if successful, it would manage directly just four hotels in the chain. It would leave the remainder with their existing management which it would train. A condition of the tender is that the successful bidder would not be able to sell off any of the 15 hotels for three years. The SPA is due to launch a public offering for the remaining 49 per cent once the majority stake has been sold.</p>

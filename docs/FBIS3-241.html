This meeting is "part of necessary  consultations with various national political actors with a view  to reinforcing democracy," a communique published by the  government daily L'UNION stated.    The government blamed the main opposition party, the  National  Lumberjacks Rally [RNB] and its leader, Father Paul Mba  Abessole, for the violence that erupted in several districts of  the capital, following a general strike called by a labor union  close to the opposition. The labor union was demanding wage  increases in the aftermath of the 11 January CFA franc  devaluation.    The RNB has not yet made a decision either to participate or  not in the 7 March meeting. Its general assembly is slated for  tomorrow, a party spokesman disclosed.</p>

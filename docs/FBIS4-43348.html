			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed SDC: "Bosnian Presidency Wants </F> International Conference"]    [Text] Brussels, 8 Jun (BELGA) -- "The Bosnian presidency  feels that it does not really make much sense to continue the  negotiations in Geneva because these talks always end up in a  vicious circle. Instead of these talks, there should be an  international conference on the Bosnian issue," two members of  the Bosnian presidency said Wednesday [8 June] at a press  conference in Brussels.    Mirko Pejanovic, a Bosnian Serb, and Ivan Komsic, a Bosnian  Croat, are both part of the Bosnian presidency and both took  part in the peace talks in Geneva.    "The key question of how much territory should be given to  the parties involved has ensured that the peace consultations in  Geneva always end up in an impasse," they said. "Instead of the  talks in Geneva, there should be an international conference  with the five major powers (namely Russia, the United States,  Great Britain, France, and Germany), the European Union, the  United Nations, and the Conference of Islamic Countries,"  Pejanovic and Komsic said on behalf of the Bosnian presidency.  Russia had already suggested organizing a similar conference,  but the other partners were not interested for the time being.    "The idea of a federation with cantons must form the basis  of  a complete peace plan for Bosnia," Pejanovic and Komsic said.  In order to stress that this is feasible, they pointed to the  Washington Agreement whereby the Bosnian Muslims and Croats  would set up a federation on the territory of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. This federation has since been formed, a  president has been elected, and a government is being put  together.    "The international community must take care of the rest,"  Pejanovic and Komsic said: "The return of refugees, the  setting-up of `miniprotectorates' around the most important  cities along the lines of Mostar and Sarajevo, and the temporary  control of the borders of Bosnia-Herzegovina."    Furthermore, the European Union should agree to the  accession  of Bosnia to the Union, according to Pejanovic and Komsic,  especially with an eye on the economic reconstruction of the  country, "which is currently a mess." In order to guarantee  security, Bosnia must be able "to join NATO," they said.    Pejanovic and Komsic are in Brussels to hold talks with the  European Commission. They will also be received at the Belgium  Foreign Ministry.</p>

			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Greek-Albanian tension rises Greece yesterday expelled a second Albanian diplomat after a meeting of public order ministry officials failed to resolve increasing tensions between the two countries. The officials had met to discuss last week's cross-border raid on a military camp in southern Albania, in which two Albanian soldiers were killed. The Albanian officials claimed that Greek commandos were responsible; their Greek counterparts denied the charge and accused Tirane of stepping up human rights abuses against the ethnic Greek minority in southern Albania. The official Athens News Agency said three senior members of the ethnic Greek political movement Omonia had been arrested and charged with 'anti-constitutional activity.' The Greek and Albanian foreign ministers, Mr Karolos Papoulias and Mr Alfred Serreqi, have agreed to meet on May 3 in Zurich to try to improve relations.</p>

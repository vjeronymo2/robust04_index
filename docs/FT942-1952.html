			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / World Trade News: EU to discuss broadcast directive Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the member of the European Union Commission responsible for broadcasting, said that the EU would convene a conference to consider proposed changes in the broadcast directive. He promised that these would not be anti-US and that quotas would not be tightened, writes Nancy Dunne in Washington. The 1989 broadcasting directive has been at the centre of a long row between the US and EU. It requires EU-based television channels to allot at least half their broadcasting time to European-made programmes, not including news, sport, games or advertising. Washington is also unhappy about subsidies for European film-makers, especially as US films contribute much of the funding through a levy on cinema shows. However, the European audiovisual industry believes the support is essential to counter competition by cheap US imports. Mr Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of America, said he was encouraged by signs that the European industry might be willing to compromise.</p>

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / CIA settlement over sex bias The CIA has agreed to settle charges of sex discrimination by one of the agency's senior female spies in a deal valued at Dollars 410,000 (Pounds 262,800) by the spy's attorney. The complaint, filed under seal in federal court in August by 'Jane Doe Thompson', a pseudonym for the female CIA employee, portrayed the agency as rife with womanisers and drinking and generally hostile to women. Mr James Woolsey, CIA director, said in a statement that he agreed to settle the case, but that the organisation 'does not concede the assertions of gender discrimination Ms Thompson has made against the agency or its individual officers'. Ms Victoria Toensing, Ms Thompson's attorney and a former Justice Department official, said the lawsuit alleged both sex discrimination and violations of Ms Thompson's constitutional rights. Ms Thompson has been identified by numerous press reports as Ms Janine Brookner, the first female CIA station chief in Latin America and a 21-year veteran of the agency. The reports said her ordeal began when she was sent to clean up the agency's operation in Jamaica.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The foreign ministers of the North Atlantic  Coordination Council countries held a meeting in Istanbul  yesterday. A delegation from our country, presided over by  Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi, participated in this meeting.    In a speech he gave at this meeting, Mr. Serreqi stressed  among other things that Albania assesses that the Partnership  for Peace [PFP] initiative marks a new qualitative step in the  direction of setting up trust, security, and practical  cooperation with NATO and its member countries, as well as other  East European countries. Albania has supported the PFP idea  since the very beginning. Albania's signing of a (?framework)  document at the highest level clearly speaks for the vital  interest in actively taking part in this process, in the service  of peacekeeping and peacemaking.    Mr. Serreqi said that through active participation in a  partnership, we aim at closer, more qualitative, and concrete  cooperation with the NATO, which will pave the way for our  country's future membership in this vital political and military  collective security organization.    He talked about the democratic reform that is being carried  out successfully in the Army. He said that we have implemented  the organization of the Army and ensured transparency in the  questions of planning the defense and military budget. We are  confident, he said, that cooperation within the PFP framework  will play a decisive role in further advancing this reform and  modernizing the Armed Forces, thus aiming at coming ever closer  to reaching NATO standards.    During his stay, Mr. Serreqi held several private meetings  with the foreign ministers of NATO countries such as U.S.  Secretary of State Christopher, German Foreign Minister Kinkel,  the foreign ministers of Turkey, Spain, Belgium, Netherlands,  Denmark, etc.    In these meetings, they discussed aspects of bilateral  relations as well as the relations of our country with NATO and  the European Union [EU]. The situation in the region occupied a  special place in these meetings, particularly the recent  developments in Greek-Albanian relations, at a time when Greece  alone continues to block, in the EU Council of Ministers and  Finance and Economy, the granting of a consensus for aid  amounting to ECU35 million toward the balance of payments in  Albania.    During the reception hosted for the delegation heads, Mr.  Serreqi met with Turkish Prime Minister Ciller. She reconfirmed  her desire to visit Albania soon.    During the meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Cetin, Mr.  Serreqi talked about bilateral relations in the framework of the  opportunities opened up by the visit to Turkey of President  Berisha, both at the political and economic level.    During the break between sessions, with the initiative of  the  Greek delegation, Mr. Serreqi talked with Greek Foreign Minister  Papoulias. Mr. Serreqi stressed that since the meeting in  Zurich, and after the acceptance of a second meeting by the  Greeks, there has been no incident that would make the  development of dialogue difficult. At this time, the resurgence  of an anti-Albanian campaign and propagation of absurd claims  about arrests and repression among the Greek minority, in order  to justify the cancellation of the meeting of foreign ministers  and hinder Albania's relations with the EU, is inconceivable.    For his part, Mr. Papoulias said he was in favor of lowering  tones and creating a climate enabling the resumption of dialogue.    Mr. Serreqi held a very important meeting with his Italian  counterpart Maroni. After becoming acquainted with the  situation in Albania, Mr. Maroni expressed his admiration for  the results of reform in our country. He said that Albania  represents a special case in Central and East Europe and is  characterized by political stability and economic achievements.  He said that the Italian Government acknowledges Albania's  great contribution and role toward stability in the Balkans.    Mr. Serreqi stated that the Albanian Government does not see  relations with Italy as a neighbor on a bilateral level alone,  but as involving priority relations that are being developed  with a friendly country that plays an important role not only in  the EU and NATO, but also in other international entities. Thus  Albanian-Italian relations assume a multilateral dimension.    Minister Maroni confirmed to Mr. Serreqi the desire of the  new Italian Government to further develop relations between  Italy and our country.    They also talked about the practical implementation of  existing projects, as well as future plans. Mr. Maroni said  that Italy will be more engaged in strengthening Albania's  relations with NATO and the European Union. Minister Serreqi  invited his Italian counterpart for a visit to Albania. The  date of the visit will be determined through diplomatic channels.</p>

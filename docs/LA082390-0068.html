			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOCIETY: CELEBRATING THE ARRIVAL OF SUCCESS;  </P> <P> MUSIC: THE MOOD WAS AS LAVISH AS THE SETTING AT SUMMERFEST '90, WHERE PRAISE  FLOWED LIKE WINE FOR THE COMING OF AGE OF THE LA JOLLA CONCERT SERIES.  </P> <P> If the mood makes the party, the mood at the SummerFest '90 gala given Saturday  at the Romona Sahm estate was one of self-congratulation, leavened with a dash  of awe and the faintest touch of surprise.  </P> <P> The object of all these semi-defined feelings was the uncontested coming of age  of the SummerFest concert series, founded in 1986 by the La Jolla Chamber Music  Society and now, according to its backers, the subject of not only national  attention but national acclaim.  </P> <P> The SummerFest '90 series opened Friday night at Sherwood Auditorium in La  Jolla, and will continue there through Tuesday under the direction of  conductors Heiichiro Ohyama and Andre Previn. The works performed survey the  chamber format rather comprehensively, ranging from Mozart concertos to  contemporary pieces written by 35-year-old New York composer Bruce Adolphe.  </P> <P> "The artists say this is one of the most important chamber music venues," said  Robert Doede, one of the principal series founders. "Many say that they would  rather play here than anywhere else."  </P> <P> "'We're really moving into the big time," added Marie Olesen, past president of  the music society. "In five years, we have come to be viewed by the musicians  as the best chamber music festival in the country. Opening night was fabulous,  and the Schumann piece (Piano Quintet in E-flat Major, Opus 44) was as good as  you'll hear."  </P> <P> The 110 guests at Saturday's gala -- all concert series patrons who contributed  a minimum of $1,000 per couple -- were invited to hear a mid-evening program of  works by Persichetti, Faure and Beethoven, offered as a musical intermezzo  between a lavish champagne reception and an equally lavish dinner.  </P> <P> The setting lent itself to the peculiar requirements of the gala, to say the  least.  </P> <P> The Sahm estate, over the years, has been the site of the first two "A Night in  Monte Carlo" balls for the then-La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art, of the  annual Christmas musicale jointly sponsored by the San Diego Symphony and the  San Diego Opera, of country-Western hoedowns for the Voices for Children  Auxiliary and, in the early 1980s, of the only three "throlf" tournaments known  to have been given anywhere on this planet. Throlf, a pristinely wacky game  that calls for golf balls to be thrown from hole to hole, was the brainchild of  La Jolla's Lawrence Waddy; the tournaments benefited the symphony.  </P> <P> But, for Saturday's event, the massive house provided a soaring glass and wood  music room spacious enough to accommodate the musicians and guests in comfort,  one with acoustics that several musicians compared favorably to those of a good  concert hall.  </P> <P> As flutist Carol Wincenc and harpist Deborah Hoffman settled in for the opening  piece, Persichetti's Serenade No. 10 (Opus 79), the mood in and outside the  room seemed to shift with them -- the crowd grew notably silent and intense,  and the sky brooding behind them darkened from the dusky blue of an Indian  sapphire to an imperfect onyx irradiated with flecks of stars. Just as the  music took a particularly sharp turn into a flying scherzando, the mood was  broken by the emphatic croaking of the many frogs the populate the ponds beside  Sahm's front walk. Closing the doors took care of the unexpected amphibian  obbligato.  </P> <P> After the concert, which included Faure's brief but beguiling "Morceau de  Concours" and Beethoven's String Trio in G Major (Opus 9, No. 1), perennial  SummerFest sponsor Peter Preuss related the music to the surroundings.  </P> <P> "This is one of the few occasions upon which chamber music is played in the  setting it was meant for," he said. "The gala audience replicates the classic  chamber music audience, which almost gives tonight a sense of nostalgia.  Chamber music sounds best in a private home."  </P> <P> Guests fortified themselves for the concert by browsing on an hors d'oeuvres  buffet arranged by caterer John Baylin, who "painted" Picasso-like  representations of a lute and a woman's face in capers, chopped salmon and  caviars of various colors, all applied to an edible canvas of cream cheese. One  of those inspecting the display was current music society President Brenda  Baker, who said that musicians now request a billet on the SummerFest program.  "We're attracting national attention to San Diego," she said. "Artists are  coming to us from everywhere."  </P> <P> Baylin served in a setting of some drama, around the massive indoor pool that  occupies the farthest wing of the house. Gala Chairman Peggy Preuss decorated  the tables formally with extravagant bouquets of white roses clustered around  silver candelabra; the meal included grilled duck breast with exotic relishes  and a hot-and-cold salad of sauteed forest mushrooms and chilled greens. "The  SummerFest gala is becoming a significant event for San Diego," she said. "It's  a state of mind that calls for elegance and glamour."  </P> <P> Many of the principal musicians, including pianists Emanuel and Yoko Ax and  violinist Gyorgy Pauk, joined the dinner as guests; many also found themselves  renewing old acquaintances, since music society board members and sponsors  traditionally house the visiting artists.  </P> <P> SummerFest artistic director Heiichiro Ohyama and his wife, artist Gail Ohyama,  headed a guest list that included festival General Chairman Lois Kohn; Sharon  and Neil Derrough; Roger Revelle; Romona Sahm with Chuck LaBar; Bea and Bob  Epsten; Marcia and Harvey Schuster; Beverly and Joseph Glickman; Lynn  Hillegrund with Stephen Zahorik; Suzanne and John Koch.  </P></p>

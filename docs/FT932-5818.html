			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Finance warning on Tube services LONDON UNDERGROUND yesterday warned that improvements in service on London's Underground network could be jeopardised if the government goes ahead with reductions in investment announced in the Autumn Statement. The company, announcing the results of the first year of the Underground's Customer Charter, said that it had achieved all its service performance targets for 1992-93. These covered train service, punctuality, cleanliness, staff helpfulness, ticketing, escalator and escalator service and station closures. In some cases targets had been comfortably exceeded, with 91 per cent of lifts in service during the peak hours compared with a target of 85 per cent. The number of violent crimes against customers was 1.29 per million journeys, compared with a target of 1.6 per million. In the first year of its Customer Charter London Underground paid out just more than Pounds 68,000 in refunds for delays of 20 minutes or more which were the company's responsibility. Targets for most performance indicators will be increased next year with much higher standards of train cleanliness, information for passengers and reliability of train services and lifts. But Mr Denis Tunnicliffe, managing director, said efficient management alone could not sustain service improvements if investment fell. He said: 'The key to a decently modern metro is good management and the right level of investment.' Mr Steven Norris, minister for transport in London, said he shared London Underground's disappointment at funding. He promised to battle with the Treasury to secure the best possible deal in the next public expenditure round in the autumn.</p>

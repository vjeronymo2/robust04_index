			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Brazilian central bank bars sell-off incentives EFFORTS to attract greater foreign participation in Brazil's privatisation programme are being blocked by the central bank, which fears the move might interfere with negotiations on the government's debt to foreign banks. Both domestic and foreign debt can be used to pay the government for companies being privatised, but under current rules the domestic debt is swapped at face value while foreign debt carries a fixed 25 per cent discount rate. Mr Eduardo Modiano, co-ordinator of the privatisation programme, believes this discount is the main reason for the lack of foreign participation so far. Of the Dollars 1.72bn raised by the programme, only 1.9 per cent has been paid in foreign debt paper. 'The discount is not attractive and it seems like discrimination against foreigners,' Mr Modiano said. He wants to replace this with an auction system to let the market set the value. Mr Modiano fears that without access to the Dollars 45bn stock of MYDFA  - the technical term for the bulk of Brazil's debt to foreign banks - the programme will raise far less than originally planned. He said in an interview yesterday: 'I have no doubt that if we had a smaller discount we could achieve a higher price and attract a larger number of investors.' The new rules were planned to be in place by mid-March. However the central bank insists that any such changes must be reserved as bargaining chips in Brazil's external debt negotiations which restarted in New York yesterday.</p>

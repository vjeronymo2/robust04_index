			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Letter: Real interest rates and the exchange rate connection (1) Sir, Samuel Brittan's suggestion (Economic Viewpoint, July 2) that world real interest rates remain stuck at about 4 per cent judging by the yield on UK indexed bonds is incorrect because it ignores the effect of exchange rates. The experience of floating exchange rates in the last 20 years supports the theory that world real interest rates are not in fact equalised by the markets, but can be higher (or lower) in one country if the exchange rate is perceived to be overvalued (or undervalued). In effect, international investors demand compensation for the exchange rate's expected movement. Thus we can only deduce the level of 'world' real interest rates from the yield on UK indexed gilts by guessing at how much the markets believe the pound is overvalued. The test of this theory will be if the US Treasury begins to offer index-linked stock as is reportedly under consideration. If the US dollar is currently around 10 per cent undervalued against the pound, then US index-linked stock should yield around 3 per cent, allowing the international investor to expect the same return on US Treasuries as on gilts over a 10-year period given the likely exchange rate correction. (The indexation element will cover any exchange rate moves due to any future differential between US and UK inflation.) This would imply that 'world' real interest rates are somewhere between 1 per cent and 4 per cent. My guess is that the markets may believe the pound to be more than 10 per cent overvalued, which points to world real interest rates being around 3 per cent. This would support Samuel Brittan's view, and mine, that the world is not suffering any shortage of capital at present.

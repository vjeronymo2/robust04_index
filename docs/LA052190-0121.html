			<p><P> May 21, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S. HIGH COURT RESTRICTS STATES' DAM CONTROLS  </P> <P> The Supreme Court ruled unanimously today that the federal government has  exclusive legal power over federally licensed hydroelectric power plants and  that individual states cannot impose environmental regulations on the projects.  </P> <P> Writing for the court, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor rejected the pleas of  California, 43 other states and environmentalists seeking to give state  agencies the authority to regulate water flow to power plants.  </P> <P> The case involved a hydroelectric project on Rock Creek, a tributary of the  American River near Placerville. The owner, Rock Creek Limited Partnership,  planned to generate electric power and sell it to Pacific Gas &amp; Electric  Co.  </P> <P> In approving the project in 1983, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  required that the plant maintain minimum water flow rates to protect the  creek's fish population.  </P> <P> The state water resources agency then sought to further limit the flow of water  for the project in an effort to assure the survival of trout and other types of  fish in the creek.  </P> <P> O'Connor, normally a strong advocate of states' rights, ruled in this case that  the federal government was given exclusive authority by Congress in regulating  hydroelectric power plants.  </P> <P> "Allowing California to impose significantly higher minimum stream flow  requirements would disturb and conflict with the balance embodied in the  federal agency's determination," she said in the 14-page opinion that was a  victory for the nation's utilities.  </P> <P> The decision keeps sole power over the plants with the federal government,  which has had broad authority over developing and licensing hydroelectric  projects since 1935.  </P> <P> Electric utilities had warned that the financial health of numerous plants  could be threatened if states suddenly were allowed to limit the flow of water  to them.  </P></p>

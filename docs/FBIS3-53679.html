			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Tawfiq 'Abid] </F>   [Excerpt] A ranking Palestinian official has warned against  the flow of weapons into the West Bank and Gaza Strip, adding  that the sources of these weapons are known. In a statement to  AL-DUSTUR, 'Abbas Zaki, member of the Fatah Central Committee,  said that Palestinian citizens purchase weapons under the slogan  of self-defense, not under militant slogans. He said that the  purchases are not carried out at central instructions, adding  that this situation would create uncontrollable chaos.    'Abbas Zaki added: We discovered an Israeli plan to sow  sedition among citizens in the occupied territory. He warned  the fighters, particularly the Fatah Hawks, against carrying  their weapons and shooting in the streets. He said: The  Israeli enemy is encouraging such manifestations within the  framework of its preparation for a civil war.    Zaki disclosed that the Israelis are propagating a  particular  type of weapon which is also a detector. This weapon, he added,  transmits signals which will help the Israeli soldiers, who  carry electronic devices, locate this weapon and arrest its  carrier. He added that one of the Fatah cadres was arrested by  this method although he was in a safe place. Meanwhile, he  said, the Israeli Army was unable to arrest this cadre's  colleague who lost his weapon in a fedayeen operation. 'Abbas  Zaki said: The Israeli Army can collect these weapons if they  are used against it anytime it wants. [passage omitted]</p>

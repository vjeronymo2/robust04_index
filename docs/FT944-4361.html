			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / International Company News: US-backed consortium wins control of Embraer Wasserstein Perella, the US financial house, yesterday emerged as a significant investor in the privatisation of Embraer, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer. Wasserstein is the single largest member of a consortium headed by Bozano Simonsen, the Brazilian investment bank, which won control of Embraer at an auction at the Sao Paulo stock exchange. The consortium, which will control 45 per cent of the voting stock, is made up of Wasserstein Perella, which holds 41 per cent of the consortium's shares, and the pension funds of the government-controlled companies Telebras and Banco do Brasil, which together hold about half the capital. The rest of the consortium is made up of Bozano Simonsen and a foundation of Cesp, a state-controlled electricity company. Mr Paulo Ferraz, chief executive officer of Bozano Simonsen, said that Wasserstein, partly-owned by the Japanese financial house Nomura, had been examining Embraer for some time and was acting as an investor and not as a representative of other overseas buyers. Hundreds of riot police and troops with machine guns closed streets around the exchange before the sale, after fears of demonstrations by disgruntled workers. However, the auction passed off peacefully. The federal government sold 55.4 per cent of the voting stock for Rl 154.2m (Dollars 130.5m), slightly above the reserve price.</p>

			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Media Futures: Business lead for caller identification Despite the hype about video-on-demand and home shopping, on past form it was always likely that business, rather than residential applications, would lead the march towards commercial multimedia services. So it is proving, with the progressive integration of office personal computers with telecommunications networks. The video phone is a case in point. Most of those currently on offer are windows-based systems which convert the PC into a video phone by means of an appropriate 'card' and camera placed on top of the PC screen. Another line of development is the rise of 'computer telephony integration' (CTI) systems, which enable PCs to be used to process telephone calls. CTI is advancing fast in the sales, marketing and customer support fields, where there is strong and immediate corporate demand for enhanced methods of dealing with phone-based business. The introduction into the UK this autumn of 'calling line identification' - a new phone facility which passes the number of the calling party to the person being called before the call is answered - is set to give a significant boost to computer telephony integration. For businesses dealing with customers by phone, it will make it possible to set up systems enabling telephone staff to summon customer records on the PC screen before answering calls. The race is on to provide low-cost CTI systems which can take advantage of calling line identification, and to make them available to small and medium-sized businesses which have as much to gain from them as those in the large corporate sector. AT&amp;T, the US telecoms company, claims to have made a low-cost breakthrough this month with its 'PassageWay' products, developed jointly with Novell, the US computer networking software supplier. AT&amp;T's 'PassageWay Direct Connection' and 'PassageWay Telephony Services' systems link the PC to the telephone line, making available a range of windows-based functions. These include the provision of screen 'cards' on customers, which can be displayed within seconds through calling-line identification, and the ability to dial directly from the PC using a stored data base. The PC keeps a record of incoming and outgoing calls and all functions are available at the click of a mouse. The 'PassageWay' software is retailing at Pounds 475 per line. However, users may also need new hardware to integrate their phone and PC systems. This is available for less than Pounds 1,000 for a small business that has less than 16 telephone lines. A 50-workstation user licence is available for around Pounds 7,000.</p>

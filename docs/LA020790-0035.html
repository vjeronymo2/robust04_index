			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: SAN MARCOS GRAD GIVES NEW MEANING TO RADICAL CHIC: 'SQUAT  OR ROT'  </P> <P> It's nice to know some things never change.  </P> <P> Students at Berkeley are protesting. The Barrington 40 have semi-barricaded  themselves inside a cooperative dormitory just off the University of California  campus, a few blocks from People's Park.  </P> <P> At the center of the storm is an honors graduate from San Marcos High School:  Rebekah Ekberg, a sophomore majoring in dance, music and physiology.  </P> <P> She has emerged as the spokeswoman for the group that refuses to leave  Barrington Hall despite an eviction order from the student-run cooperative  association.  </P> <P> She's credited with coin-  </P> <P> ing the rallying cry that now appears on tie-dyed T-shirts: Squat or Rot. She  was quoted: "This is my home. This is an environment I choose to be in."  </P> <P> The student association says Barrington Hall is a hotbed of rowdy parties,  acidheads and freeloaders. Somebody threw a washer and dryer from the roof.  </P> <P> The Barrington protesters say that's all hooey. They say the eviction move is a  ploy in the never-ending factionalism of student politics.  </P> <P> Protesters are allowed to go to classes, but once back at Barrington, they get  no visitors and no phone calls.  </P> <P> "Rebekah is radical but not radical destructive like the old days," says a  Daily Cal reporter. "She's radical new wave, sensible, goal-directed. She  developed her own major."  </P> <P> Randy Wilson, head counselor at San Marcos High, remembers Ekberg having "great  passion" for anything she tackled, from honors English to cheerleading.  </P> <P> "What I remember best about Becky was her willingness to be different," Wilson  said. "She didn't fit into any mold, which is hard to do on a high school  campus where there is so much peer pressure to conform. Becky was always  herself."  </P> <P> Marv Glusac, the principal, also recalls Ekberg fondly. And he has some  paternal advice, straight from the 1960s.  </P> <P> "If you talk to Becky," he said, "tell her this protest stuff is OK but not to  let it interfere with her education."  </P> <P> As I said, there is comfort in continuity.  </P> <P> </P> <P> St. Mary's Fertile Fund-Raiser  </P> <P> Grab bag.  </P> <P> * Just when you thought every possible method of school financing had been  tried.  </P> <P> St. Mary's Catholic School in Oceanside just held a successful "cow-plop"  fund-raiser. That's where a field (in this case, the football field) is marked  off in squares, the squares are then sold, and a cow is let loose.  </P> <P> If the cow drops a plop in your square, you win a prize.  </P> <P> The St. Mary's event took a little longer than anticipated. The first two plops  were in unsold squares.  </P> <P> Finally, on the third plop, success: A man from Orange County won $3,000.  </P> <P> * It's election year, so out-of-town politicians are making their pilgrimages  to San Diego.  </P> <P> The latest is San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith, quietly talking up his  campaign for the Democratic nomination for attorney general. His opponent is  L.A. County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, snared in the McMartin mess.  </P> <P> * Escondido Councilman Jerry Harmon, a member of the ruling slow-growth  coalition, will announce today that he's a candidate for mayor.  </P> <P> The June election will be the first time Escondido voters have elected a mayor.  </P> <P> * The first rule of advertising is "know your market."  </P> <P> Which brings us to a San Diego man who sells mini-stun guns, $47 each, 65,000  volts, 5 inches long, 2 inches wide.  </P> <P> He's got ads plastered on the door to the portable potty above Black's Beach,  the city's unofficial playground for nudists, where peeping Toms are a constant  problem.  </P> <P> </P> <P> What Goes Around, Comes Around  </P> <P> Small World Deptartment.  </P> <P> In February, 1988, students from two Oceanside high schools threw a Champagne  bottle overboard while taking an ocean-going field trip. They put a note  inside.  </P> <P> Bottle and note just washed ashore 6,000 miles away in Guam.  </P> <P> Into the waiting hands of Don Carlson, 52, an emergency landing specialist with  NASA who was in Guam to prepare for the shuttle landing.  </P> <P> Carlson was born and raised in Oceanside and graduated from Ramona High School.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOUISIANA GOVERNOR AGAIN TRYING TO LURE GIANTS  </P> <P> Gov. Buddy Roemer says he has resumed talks with the owner of the San Francisco  Giants about moving to New Orleans.  </P> <P> Voters in Santa Clara, Calif., recently rejected a bond issue to build a new  home for the Giants.  </P> <P> Team owner Bob Lurie has expressed a desire to leave San Francisco's windy  Candlestick Park.  </P> <P> "The owner would like to remain in the San Francisco area," Roemer said during  an impromptu news conference Thursday. "He's still trying to do that. He and I  have spoken, and if San Francisco doesn't work out, he's interested in New  Orleans. He's not yet ready to make a commitment."  </P> <P> San Francisco and San Jose also have rejected moves to build a new home for the  Giants.  </P> <P> Lurie has said the Giants will play the 1991 season in Candlestick Park, but he  may have to look elsewhere for a new home after that.  </P> <P> In another baseball development, the head of one of the two groups seeking a  baseball expansion franchise for the Washington, D.C., area dropped out of the  bidding today, saying the national economic downturn had hurt his efforts to  attract investors.  </P> <P> Mark Tracz said he told the National League's expansion committee his Capital  Region Baseball, Inc., was short of the $250 million needed to put a team in  Washington's Northern Virginia suburbs.  </P> <P> The withdrawal leaves one group, led by Washington developer John Akridge,  bidding for one of the two new franchises the National League will award to  begin play in the 1993 season.  </P> <P> The National League is asking $95 million as an entry fee for the two new  franchises and Tracz said putting together a baseball organization and building  a stadium in Northern Virginia put the cost out of reach for his investment  group.  </P></p>

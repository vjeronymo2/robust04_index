			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Katin] </F>   [Text] Army Chief General Humberto Ortega will leave the  military ranks and hand over his command on 21 February 1995, a  source close to the presidential palace confirmed to BARRICADA.    Gen. Ortega's retirement was agreed on yesterday during a  "top-level closed-door meeting" held at the Olof Palme  Convention Center under tight security. Attending the meeting  were members of the Executive Branch, the National Assembly  Blocs Assembly, and the EPS [Sandinist People's Army] General  Staff.    Among those attending were Presidency Minister Antonio  Lacayo, Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta, National Assembly  Representatives Luis Humberto Guzman, Sergio Ramirez, Frank  Duarte, and Ivan Salvador Madriz. Also present were Gen. Ortega  and the EPS top command.    Our source told this newspaper that President Violeta  Barrios  de Chamorro will announce the decision on an unspecified date.  It is believed this could be on 2 September, during the Army  Day celebration.    One of the participants of the meeting told BARRICADA that  the points the Executive Branch brought to the fore were related  to the Military Organization Code, the deadline for Gen.  Ortega's retirement, and the situation of terror that exists in  the country's northern region. That highly reliable source said  Gen. Ortega seemed at ease when talking of his departure, "which  will take place on 21 February 1995."    President Chamorro will announce Gen. Ortega's retirement  and  the name of his replacement, once the National Assembly approves  the Military Code. "Chamorro may make the announcement on 2  September during the Armed Forces anniversary, the source said.  On that same date, President Chamorro announced Gen. Ortega  would step down in 1994, prompting a violent reaction by the  EPS, which was taken by surprise.    When asked by BARRICADA, Gen. Ortega said the topic of the  Army had been discussed "very superficially" during the meeting,  downplaying the importance of the matter. "These were general  topics, first to work out final aspects of the law we have  drafted and which will be in the Assembly in a few days.  Second, we discussed the conflict in the north," the EPS chief  stated. "The idea is to submit the bill for the consideration of  the National Assembly so we can have a law based on a consensus  between state branches within a sensible period of time," he  added.    Deputies Roberto Urroz and Adolfo Jarquin of the Nicaraguan  Democratic Movement and Social Democratic Party, respectively,  felt this is positive solution to the existing problem. When  commenting on the matter, Urroz said a source of tension will be  eliminated and "once Ortega's replacement is announced, he will  be the one to take over the reigns of the EPS."</p>

			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PICTURING CALIFORNIA  </P> <P> The Ansel Adams photograph, "Winter Sunrise, The Sierra Nevada, from Lone Pine,  Calif.," shown as part of "Picturing California" (Sept. 3), reminded me of the  absolutely magnificent views of that mountain range that can be seen from  Highway 395 and the incredibly talented eye possessed by Adams. However, if the  camera is looking west toward the north-south Sierra Nevada range from Lone  Pine, the rays of the morning sun should be coming from behind. Can you shed  any light on this quirk of nature?  </P> <P> SHEL ERLICH  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P> <P> The correct title of the photo is "Mount Williamson, The Sierra Nevada, From  Manzanar, California, 1945."  </P> <P>  -- The Editors  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> TEXAN WHO BLEW 'EM AWAY AT THE ROXY DRAWS A BEAD ON O.C.  </P> <P> A Texas guitar hero whose sonic palette isn't limited to 5,283 shades of blues?  Sounds almost unbelievable? Yep, and -- not coincidentally -- that's a  semi-accurate assessment of the git-tar star himself, Eric Johnson, who plays  the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano tonight.  </P> <P> Celebrating the impending release of "Ha Via Musicom" -- only his second  major-label LP in five years -- at the Roxy on Sunday, Johnson wowed the crowd  with a tone that could cut diamondback rattlesnakes and walk between the  slices, with an ear-popping, sophisticated sense of harmonics, and with  endless, cascading flurries of 32nd notes.  </P> <P> Johnson also sings, in a plaintive tenor that matches his rail-thin, blond  page-boy looks. Supported by bassist Kyle Brock and drummer Tommy Taylor,  Johnson's vocal numbers took on an epic sweep -- and a slightly harder edge --  than their studio counterparts. Play it purty, son.  </P> <P> Of course, Johnson is nuthin' but versatile, replicating pedal steel rags and  pausing for a pair of acoustic numbers, before genuflecting to the ghost of  Jimi Hendrix for the final encore of "Spanish Castle Magic."  </P> <P> A picker's picker, fer sure -- three quarters of the guitar aces in the full  house looked like they wanted to go home and practice -- but his  never-lose-the-beauty-of-the-melody approach may win him a wider audience --  providing Johnson takes something less than five years before his next local  swing.  </P> <P>  Eric Johnson plays tonight at 8 at the Coach House, 33157 Camino Capistrano,  San Juan Capistrano. Tickets: $15. Information: (714) 496-8930.  </P></p>

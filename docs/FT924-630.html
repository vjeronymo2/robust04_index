			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: A Standard solution It is difficult to exonerate Standard Chartered entirely from the charge that it is selling the family silver to pay for its losses in Bombay. Had it not had to make Pounds 100m in provisions on its Indian business this year, its capital ratios would be stronger. But the bank's sale of real estate in Hongkong, Singapore and Malaysia is also a response to a more serious underlying problem; its capital is denominated in sterling while its assets are mostly in dollar-related currencies. Without the property proceeds, sterling's depreciation would have taken its tier 1 ratio down to only around 4.6 per cent at the year end. Instead the ratio should end up at a more comfortable level close to 5.5 per cent, enabling the bank to keep pace with Asia's rapid economic growth. An alternative solution might have been to raise dollar preference capital, but Standard seems cautious about taking the plunge, possibly because its developing world involvement would make US disclosure requirements particularly onerous. Relief that the bank had not decided to solve the problem through a rights issue helped its shares advance 4 per cent yesterday. They may have further to rise, but there is a danger in getting carried away. The Bombay scandal will mean a high tax charge as well as provisions this year; Standard will have to make additional provisions on its Pounds 100m Isosceles exposure. Then there is its reputation for being accident-prone. The bank is at pains to stress the commercial justification for selling its Hongkong property at this stage in the cycle. If it is right, one has to hope it will not now use the proceeds to lend aggressively on real estate.</p>

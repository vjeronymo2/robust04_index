			<p>BFN     [Text] Vientiane, June 17 (KPL) -- The installation of  35-kv power grid stretching more than 100 km from the Socialist  Republic of Vietnam to three districts of Houa Phan Province of  Laos has started.    Houa Phan is a Lao northeastern province bordering with Son  La of Vietnam. The three beneficiaries are Siangkho, Sam Neua,  and Viangsai.    According to Mr. Sangthong Phimmachak, chief of the industry  and handicraft service and coordinator of the province, the  installation and construction is divided into three stages. The  survey, the first stage, is scheduled between June 7-July 10.  The calculation and design, the second stage, is to be  completed by the end of July. The installation and construction  of the power line is expected to start by the beginning of  August 1994 and end by the end of May 1995.    Funded by the Lao Government, the project is undertaken by  the Electricity Company No. 1 of the Socialist Republic of  Vietnam.    Electrification in the three districts of Houa Phan is aimed  at developing rural areas, reducing the slash-and-burn practice  and introducing a new way of farming to the locals.</p>

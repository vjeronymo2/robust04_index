The  discussion aimed at avoiding banalities and politicization in  the media.    Ilir Zhilla, director of ATA, stressed that ATA is a great  national asset for the mass media and called on all press organs  to use information available from ATA (some 3,000 items of world  news a day) and information provided by ATA's district  correspondents.    Mr. Zhilla asked his colleagues to respect each other and  the  organizations for which they work. He said that reporters  should avoid hostile polemics and declared that the Albanian  news media should maintain constructive policies in order to  encourage the people and the political leadership in overcoming  the difficulties of the transition period. Mr. Zhilla also  sternly criticized irresponsibility and damage to the national  interest on the part of the press.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, Apr 22, BNS -- Latvian Prime Minister Valdis  Birkavs received U.S. Ambassador Ints Silins who handed over a  letter from his country's Vice President Al Gore, the Government  Information Agency (VIA) told BNS on Friday [22 April].    Silins reiterated the unambiguous support of the U.S.  Administration for the March 15 initialed agreements on Russian  troop withdrawal. The signing of the documents would allow  international organizations to involve in the control of their  implementation, Silins said.    Silins reconfirmed the United States' commitment to allot 2  million dollars to dismantle the new building of the Russian-  operated radar facility at Skrunda as soon as the withdrawal  package is signed.    VIA failed to inform BNS about the content of Al Gore's  letter but presumably it contains the same idea as Silins said.</p>

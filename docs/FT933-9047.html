			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Arthur Scargill protests about planned NUM transfers MR ARTHUR Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers, has protested to the union's Yorkshire area over allegations by one of its senior officials that the planned transfer of the area's Pounds 5.8m assets to the NUM nationally through a new trust fund would lead to a financial crisis and a steep rise in members' contributions, Robert Taylor writes. In a letter to Mr Ken Homer, the Yorkshire area general secretary, Mr Scargill also claims that calculations by Mr John Walsh, Yorkshire agent and assistant secretary, over the proposed transfer are 'based on false figures'. Mr Walsh's claim that NUM 'office expenditure' amounted to nearly Pounds 1.7m last year is 'untrue and deplorable'. Mr Scargill says the true figure is Pounds 793,116. The NUM's return for last year to the Certification Office, which oversees union finances, was made over a fortnight ago by Mr Scargill and puts administrative expenses at Pounds 1.3m and national expenditure at Pounds 1.7m, in line with Mr Walsh's figures. Mr Scargill questions why Mr Walsh has been able to circulate his document on the proposed merger of the area into the central union to Yorkshire branch officials and members when the decision to back the transfer of Yorkshire's funds to head office was 'binding on all officials'.</p>

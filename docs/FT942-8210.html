			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / International Company News: Groupe Bull closer to sale Groupe Bull, the loss-making French computer group, yesterday appointed Banque Indosuez and SG Warburg as advisers to its planned privatisation. The announcement marks a new stage in the privatisation, which is one of the more complex sales in the French government's plans to transfer 21 publicly-owned groups to the private sector. Unlike previous privatisation issues, such as that of Rhone Poulenc, the chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, and Elf Aquitaine, the oil company, Groupe Bull will not be sold through a public offer. Instead, the government's 75.8 per cent stake is due to be reduced to a minority through the participation of industrial partners and the company's staff. Groupe Bull's financial situation also stands in marked contrast to previous privatisation issues. It has lost more than FFr15bn (Dollars 2.64bn) over the past three years, although a recovery strategy implemented by Mr Jean-Marie Descarpentries, who took over as chairman last year, brought a sharp improvement in first-quarter results. Net losses in the first three months were reduced by 45 per cent, to FFr942m. The privatisation is expected to take place in stages. Mr Descarpentries has said, however, he hopes to reduce the government's stake to a minority by the end of the year.</p>

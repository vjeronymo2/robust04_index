			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Air strikes meet UN opposition United Nations officials in Geneva were reported yesterday to have rejected the use of air strikes against Serb targets as proposed under a Nato initiative. Mr Yasushi Akashi, the UN special envoy, following his fact-finding mission on the feasibility of air strikes, met UN political and aid officials. He came out against the use of air power to open the airport in Tuzla, the biggest government stronghold, and to secure the rotation of Canadian peace-keepers in Srebrenica, the Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia. He reportedly indicated that air support would stop overland aid convoys to Tuzla and said agreement had been reached to allow Dutch troops to relieve the Canadian company in Srebrenica. In Geneva today the leaders of Bosnia's warring communities resume partition talks against a backdrop of intensified fighting and few positive indications of peace. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, told the assembly of his self-styled Serb state that the Moslems would be faced with 'all-out war' if the peace talks failed to yield an agreement.</p>

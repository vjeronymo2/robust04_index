			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> AT&amp;T Seeks Rate Cuts: Citing competitive pressures, AT&amp;T has asked the  California Public Utilities Commission to approve a 19% cut, effective Sept. 1,  for WATS -- wide area telecommunications service -- within California. That  would allow heavy users of long-distance service within California to save more  on outgoing calls -- paying $147 for 15 hours of full-state service a month  instead of $174.50. (Under PUC rules, AT&amp;T can raise or lower prices up to  15% without prior approval by the commission.) AT&amp;T also will cut rates on  its toll-free 800-prefix service Sept. 1 for incoming calls within the state by  an average of 9%, saving customers about $197.50 for 15 hours of service a  month.  </P></p>

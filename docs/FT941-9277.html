			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Abu Dhabi considers new deal on BCCI compensation The government of Abu Dhabi, majority shareholder of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International, is considering an agreement with the liquidators that would provide a greater return to hundreds of thousands of creditors around the world. Mr Ghanim Faris Al Mazrui, chairman of the working group on BCCI for the majority shareholder, said he wanted to see creditors receive more money to compensate them for delays in any pay-out since the bank was closed by regulators in July 1991. It has also emerged that a predecessor firm of Ernst &amp; Young, the principal auditors to BCCI until 1986, highlighted serious concerns at the bank with audit verification, internal auditing and the need for a single worldwide auditor as far back as 1979. Abu Dhabi would prefer to reach a negotiated settlement rather than pursue lengthy legal actions against BCCI and its liquidators that might continue for many years and entail prolonged and politically embarrassing coverage of the case.

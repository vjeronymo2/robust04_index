			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Evans Halshaw halved but sees improvement EVANS HALSHAW, the motor dealing and vehicle management group, last year reached the lowest point of its fortunes in the recession, but yesterday promised 'a real improvement in earnings' if early signs of market recovery continued. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.71m in 1992 compared with Pounds 3.86m - a 56 per cent fall caused largely by the Pounds 1.6m cost of closing car and truck dealerships in Bristol and Avonmouth. Earnings per share on continuing businesses were 10.9p (13.6p). However, with a final dividend of 7.65p, the total is maintained at 11.25p. Mr Geoffrey Dale, chairman, was relaxed about having an uncovered dividend. He noted the improvement in trading over the first quarter, observed that last year the company had taken Pounds 2m of costs out of the business and pointed to likely benefits of the development programme, notably the multi-franchise dealerships. Last year, Mr Dale said, 'was the most difficult year for our industry I can remember and I've been in it for 20 years.' Group turnover was steady at Pounds 342m (Pounds 340m). Car and commercial vehicle sales from the 43 dealerships contributed 20 per cent of the Pounds 5.4m operating profits, the rest came largely from parts and, most significantly, service business. Interest payments were Pounds 3.03m, against Pounds 3.24m. After stripping out from the balance sheet contract hire vehicles, where the amount borrowed to buy them is matched by the holding of vehicles as assets, gearing was 15 per cent.</p>

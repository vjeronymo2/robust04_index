Our sources  said that in its courageous attack, the Islamic resistance used  120mm mortars against the regime's artillery batteries,  ammunition, and personnel positions, leaving the regime forces  horrified and unable to move. Our sources said the regime  suffered heavy human and material losses. Eyewitnesses said  they saw columns of flames from far away and heard explosions of  ammunition in the storehouses for 48 hours.    After the operation, our sources added, the regime placed  all  its forces in the south on maximum alert and closed main and  secondary roads linking al-'Amarah with the other governorates  in the south. The regime forces also launched extensive searches  for the heroes of the Islamic resistance, who returned safely to  base.    It should be mentioned that large areas of al-'Amarah  marshlands were targeted by the regime's large-caliber artillery  deployed at the IV Army Corps command near the city of  al-'Amarah. The shelling destroyed hundreds of houses, caused  heavy property damage, and forced thousands of people to leave  their homes in the marshlands and seek refuge in the Islamic  Republic of Iran and in other regions inside Iraq.</p>

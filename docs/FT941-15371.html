			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Phillips says he is 'appalled' at district auditor's report findings Mr Bill Phillips, the former managing director of Westminster city council, said yesterday that he was 'appalled' at the findings of the district auditor's report and denied he was involved in a cover-up, Peter Marsh writes. Mr Phillips said he 'did not knowingly do anything improper or illegal' when working for the council. He said that allegations that he had shredded documents relevant to the district auditor's inquiry were 'complete and utter rubbish'. He added that during his four years as managing director until 1991 he had routinely disposed of documents using a shredding machine in full view of many other council officials outside his office. None of these documents were related to the inquiry by Mr John Magill, the district auditor. 'If I had disposed of incriminating documents in this way, a lot of people would have seen me,' he said. Mr Phillips, a former civil servant at the Department of the Environment, left Westminster city council to become a director of NB Selection, a London recruitment company. He will be studying the full version of the report over the next few weeks and will send his views to Mr Magill.</p>

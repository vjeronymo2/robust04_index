			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STOCKS;  </P> <P> DOW FALLS 33.49 IN LATE SELLOFF TO 8-WEEK LOW  </P> <P> Stock prices fell to an eight-week low Wednesday under a barrage of late  selling attributed to disappointing economic and earnings news.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials dropped 33.49 to 2,659.13, its lowest  close since it stood at 2,656.78 on Nov. 22.  </P> <P> Since the index hit a record closing high of 2,810.15 in the first session of  1990 on Jan. 2, it has retreated 153.37 points, or 5.46%.  </P> <P> Declining issues outnumbered advances in nationwide trading of New York Stock  Exchange-listed stocks, with 649 up, 867 down and 462 unchanged.  </P> <P> Analysts said a widening of the U.S. trade deficit to $10.5 billion in November  from $10.25 billion in October caught some market participants off guard. A  separate government report on industrial production seemed to signal that  manufacturing remained sluggish.  </P> <P> Brokers also said earnings reports from International Business Machines and  Alcoa provided little assurance for investors who have been waiting uneasily  for fourth-quarter profit figures.  </P> <P> IBM, which said its fourth-quarter earnings shrank to $1.04 a share from $3.97  a share in the like period a year earlier, dropped 1 1/4 to 98 7/8.  </P> <P> Aluminum Co. of America, another component of the Dow, fell 5 7/8 to 66 7/8  after the company came in with lower quarterly profits.  </P> <P> Alcoa's news appeared to drag down other basic industry stocks as well. Phelps  Dodge dropped 7/8 to 59; International Paper fell 3/8 to 52 1/8; Dow Chemical  slipped 1 3/8 to 67 7/8, and DuPont fell 1 5/8 to 121 5/8.  </P> <P> Caterpillar Inc., which is expected to post its results for the fourth quarter  Thursday, lost 2 1/8 to 54 7/8.  </P> <P> Aristech Chemical was the volume leader, up 1/2 at 25 1/8. A management-led  group has proposed a buyout for $26 a share.  </P> <P> Big Board volume totaled 170.47 million shares, down from Tuesday's 186.07  million.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, late selling erased gains of more than 400 points to leave the Nikkei  average slightly lower. The 225-share Nikkei slipped 29.22 points to end at  36,821.14 after plunging 666.41 Tuesday.  </P> <P> A late rally carried share prices to a modest gain for the session on the  London Stock Exchange. The Financial Times 100-share index rose 24.8 points, or  1.1%, to close at 2,373.9.  </P> <P> CREDIT  </P> <P> Bonds Close Mixed After Early Gains  </P> <P> Bond prices finished mixed following Tuesday's sharp selloff. Prices of  shorter-term issues rose slightly, while longer-term bonds slipped.  </P> <P> The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond declined 1/8 point, or $1.25 for  every $1,000 in face value. The bond's yield, which rises when its price falls,  edged up to 8.25% from 8.24% late Tuesday.  </P> <P> Analysts said bond prices started the day by recovering, buoyed by a bout of  bargain-hunting and the government's report on the U.S. trade deficit. Later,  however, bond prices lost much of their early gains.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was  quoted at 8.188%, up from 8.125% late Tuesday.  </P> <P> CURRENCY  </P> <P> Dollar Trips Over Poor Trade Report  </P> <P> The unexpected widening of the U.S. trade deficit sent the dollar falling  against most foreign currencies Wednesday.  </P> <P> Foreign exchange dealers said investors were concerned because the poor trade  performance in November was partly due to a drop in exports. Some analysts  believed that the decline indicated a further slowing of the U.S. economy.  </P> <P> Ronald Holzer, chief foreign exchange dealer with Harris Trust &amp; Co. in  Chicago, said any possible upward moves by the dollar were being limited by  traders' skeptical view of the economy. However, he said, the U.S. currency was  "beginning to base at these levels."  </P> <P> Although the trade news pushed the dollar lower, foreign exchange traders  largely focused on the West German mark and other currencies, Holzer said.  </P> <P> Overseas dealers said continuing tensions in the Soviet Union and Eastern  Europe gave the dollar some underlying support.  </P> <P> The dollar did manage a gain against the British pound. In London, one pound  cost $1.6525 late Wednesday, cheaper than late Tuesday's $1.6560. In later New  York trading, the pound was quoted at $1.65235, down from $1.6585 late Tuesday.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 145.52 Japanese yen, down from 145.75 yen  Tuesday. In London, the dollar closed at 145.45 yen, and in New York, it rose  to 145.395 yen from late Tuesday's 145.30 yen.  </P> <P> Gold prices were mixed. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold rose $1.70  to $412.50 an ounce. Republic National Bank of New York later quoted a bid of  $412.90, up $3.10 from late Tuesday.  </P> <P> COMMODITIES  </P> <P> Oil Prices Plummet as Supplies Increase  </P> <P> Oil and gasoline futures prices plummeted after an industry report showed an  increase in U.S. stocks of petroleum products after several weeks of declining  supplies.  </P> <P> On other commodity markets, precious metals futures rose, livestock and meat  futures were higher, and grains and soybeans were mixed.  </P> <P> West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 68 cents lower to 4 cents higher,  with the contract for delivery in February at $22.10 a barrel; heating oil was  0.60 cent to 3.51 cents lower, with February at 60.52 cents a gallon, and  unleaded gasoline was 1.45 to 2.88 cents lower, with February at 61.42 cents a  gallon.  </P></p>

The document  was sealed by the signatures of Mukhammat Sabirov, prime  minister of the Republic of Tatarstan, Farida Gaynullina,  chairman of the republic Council of Trade Unions, and Yuner  Yemaletdinov, president of the Association of State-Owned  Enterprises.    This is the fourth agreement among the government, the  unions, and the employers on joint participation and guarantees  in the solution of labor and socioeconomic questions based on  current legislation and the implementation of additional  measures. The previous ones helped create in Tatarstan a  well-oiled system of targeted social protection, curb the growth  of unemployment, preserve the system of preschools, and decide a  number of other questions.    The present year does not promise to be easy, and the new  agreement provides for the creation of conditions for  stabilization of the economy, social protection for the working  people and public, jobs for the population and development of  the labor market, pay and occupational and environmental safety  guarantees, and development of the social sphere in rural  localities. The commitments of each of the parties are clearly  drawn. For example, the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of  Tatarstan will retain state regulation of the maximum levels of  profitability and fixed prices on products of the monopoly  sectors and enterprises, energy, and socially significant groups  of commodities (individual foods, prescription drugs and  medication, children's items, and so forth) and also on vitally  important services, the public service of passenger transport,  individual types of communications services, and public  utilities, public gas, electric, and heating tariffs, and the  charge for housing, having entered the corresponding resources  in the republic budget. The Association of State-Owned  Enterprises of the Republic of Tatarstan will organize work on  placing orders at the enterprises for the manufacture of  machinery, mechanisms, equipment, instruments, and spares for  the needs of the national economy of the Republic of Tatarstan.    In addition, from the resources of state social insurance  the  parties plan to send to sanatoriums and recreation centers  43,000 workers (including 2,700 children); to preventive health-  sanatoriums, 80,000 persons (10,000 children); and to  health-and-fitness camps, 135,000 children.    The agreement took effect the moment it was signed.</p>

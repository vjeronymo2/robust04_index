The hospital defendants, St. Benedict's Hospital, IHC Hospitals, Inc. (``IHC''), Holy Cross Hospital of Salt Lake City, Pioneer Valley Hospital, Inc., Lakeview Hospital, Inc., Mountain View Hospital, Inc., Brigham City Community Hospital, Inc., and HCA Health Services of Utah, Inc. d/b/a St. Mark's Hospital, provide and sell general acute-care hospital services and recruit and hire nurses. The hospital defendants located in Salt Lake County compete with each other in recruiting and hiring nurses and purchase approximately 75% of the registered nursing services in that County.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. On a regular basis, the hospital defendants telephoned one another and exchanged nonpublic prospective and current wage and budget information for nurses. On a number of occasions, hospital defendants told each other, including IHC, of their intent to match whatever registered-nurse entry wage IHC eventually adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. On at least eight occasions between 1984 and 1992, some or all of the hospital defendants attended meetings organized by USHHRA for the express purpose of exchanging nonpublic prospective and current wage and budget information about registered nursing wages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Annually, IHC collected current and nonpublic prospective wage and budget information from the other hospital defendants for use in a published wage survey that was distributed to the other hospitals. IHC used this information to limit its registered-nurse wage increases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Annually, the UHA collected current and, in some years, prospective information pursuant to a survey designed by the hospital defendants. This information was published and distributed to the hospital defendants, which use this information to limit registered-nurse wage increases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. As a direct result of these wage and budget exchanges, the hospital defendant's registered-nurse entry wages in Salt Lake County and elsewhere in Utah were kept artificially low, and registered nurses were paid these lower wages from 1984 through June, 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

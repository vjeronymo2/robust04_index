			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KTTV should be complimented for airing the funeral mass of Cardinal Timothy  Manning live and without commercials on June 29. The ceremony was handled in a  dignified and informative manner by the stations' commentators. Channel 11 did  the Los Angeles community a fine public service by preempting its regular  programming to air an important and affecting event.  </P> <P> Gary A. Lynch, Los Angeles  </P></p>

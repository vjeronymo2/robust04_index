			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BASKETBALL: VENTURA COLLEGE SOPHOMORE IS BATTLING BACK AFTER THE DEATH OF HIS  BROTHER.;  </P> <P> VENABLE SPURRED BY BRYAN'S SONG  </P> <P> Kevin Venable was in an all-too-familiar scene Monday afternoon at Ventura  College. He sat in street clothes, his knees aching, and watched his teammates  scramble up and down the basketball court under Coach Phil Mathews' direction.  </P> <P> Venable, a 23-year-old sophomore, has missed nearly three seasons because of a  recurring right knee injury. His kneecap is occasionally pulled apart when he  leaps, sending him to the sidelines, where he is limited to encouraging words  and high-fives.  </P> <P> Therefore, Monday appeared to be deja vu. Venable had returned from yet another  visit to a doctor's office, this time for soreness in his left knee, which may  be a stress fracture that will keep him out four to five weeks.  </P> <P> But, despite wobbly knees that limit his playing time, Venable is wearing a  Pirate uniform again. The former Channel Islands High star can deal with the  pain, and the risk of permanent injury, because of another, more painful, blow.  </P> <P> It's a sharp pain that has pierced his heart since March, when his 21-year-old  brother, Bryan, was killed in an automobile accident. It brought Venable back  to the hardwood. Not to satisfy a bruised ego; not to prove he can still play.  </P> <P> He has returned because Bryan would have wanted it that way.  </P> <P> "It feels good to be back," Venable said with a smile as he leaned on his  scarred knee, looked at the team roster on the gymnasium wall, and read "55  Venable."  </P> <P> "Yep, it feels real good."  </P> <P> That feeling has usually ended at Venable's knees, which have required three  surgeries the past five years. Venable averaged 22 points and 13 rebounds  before his right knee blew out early in the 1986-87 season, his freshman year  at Ventura.  </P> <P> "It was real frustrating. Too frustrating," he said.  </P> <P> Venable was forced to trade his powerful inside game and incredible leaping  ability for construction work with Bryan, pouring concrete and pondering a  comeback.  </P> <P> "I always had it in the back of my mind that I would play again," Venable said.  "I was real anxious, but there was some doubt."  </P> <P> Venable rehabilitated his knee two hours a day -- often alone in Ventura's  weight room -- and stayed in shape playing pick-up games, waiting for the  decisive moment of return.  </P> <P> That came on the night of March 20, when Bryan was in a car that struck an  embankment and overturned. It ended a relationship that had grown stronger the  past three years, when Kevin wasn't busy dragging his knees up and down the  court three hours a day.  </P> <P> "I was at my aunt's house when they called," Venable said. "It was quite a  shock."  </P> <P> Shortly thereafter, Venable met with Mathews to discuss basketball.  Specifically, his desire to crash the boards and dominate inside again. Venable  was part of the 1987 state champion team that finished 31-4, a team Mathews  said would have been 35-0 with Venable in the lineup.  </P> <P> "I knew he could still play," Mathews said. "But I didn't want him to go  through the same thing he went through when he hurt that knee. That was very  painful for him, and I wanted to make sure he had rehabilitated his knee to the  point where he was comfortable to come out here and play hard."  </P> <P> No problem. Kevin was running on his own for the first time in his career and  continued to work in the weight room.  </P> <P> This comeback was in Bryan's hands.  </P> <P> "I wanted to do it for him," Venable said. "He's the reason I'm here."  </P> <P> Venable, however, isn't making a token appearance. He is one of three team  captains and started his first game back, scoring 11 points on five-for-seven  shooting from the field. Last weekend, he scored a team-high 14 points in  Ventura's 70-69 loss to Cypress in the championship game of the D. Wayne Lukas  Thoroughbred Classic, and was named to the all-tournament team.  </P> <P> "If you saw him play, you wouldn't think he had any knee problem," Mathews  said. "If he was healthy, he'd be a big-time Division I player. He's better  than some players with two good knees."  </P> <P> But watching Venable leap over helpless, would-be rebounders isn't as  entertaining to his mother, Billie Gaines. Gaines has held her son's hand in  the post-operative room three times too many.  </P> <P> "I really didn't want him to play," Gaines said. "After the last surgery, the  doctor said he didn't want to have to operate again."  </P> <P> Reluctantly, Gaines dragged herself to the season-opening intra-squad  scrimmage. She watched her son catch a finger in an eye and gasped when he  landed off-balance. Twice she left the gym.  </P> <P> "It's nerve-wracking," Gaines said. "I'm happy he's out there because it's what  he wants. But I'm apprehensive, too. I don't want to see him get hurt again."  </P> <P> Neither does Venable's step-father, Freddie Gaines. But he won't take the ball  out of Kevin's hands.  </P> <P> "It's his decision," Freddie said. "He's got guts, that's for sure."  </P> <P> Now, if only Venable had two healthy knees. He is limited to three days of  practice a week and 25 minutes of game time. He plays in pain, but doesn't want  anyone to know. "We have to strap him to the bench," Mathews said.  </P> <P> And that is a place Venable has become accustomed to the past three years. But  whether Venable is playing or watching, Mathews says he will contribute to a  team that is one of the best in the state.  </P> <P> "He has always been a leader," Mathews said. "He is a positive force. All of  the other players have tremendous respect for him."  </P> <P> Although Venable's Division I eligibility has expired and his main goal this  season is to avoid another injury, he has several Division II colleges from  chasing him.  </P> <P> And there's always Bryan, whom he says he prays for every day. Venable carries  a pin in his pocket which reads 'I Love Bryan.' "This is for him," he said.  </P></p>

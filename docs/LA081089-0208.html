			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 3 FORMER S. CAROLINA COACHES SENTENCED;  </P> <P> 4- TO 6-MONTH STAYS IN HALFWAY HOUSE ARE GIVEN IN STEROIDS CASE  </P> <P> Three former South Carolina football coaches were sentenced today to terms  ranging from three months to six months in a halfway house for their  convictions stemming from the use and distribution of steroids in the athletic  department.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge G. Ross Anderson also sentenced a Maryland man convicted of  similar charges to a three-month term at a community security facility.  </P> <P> Former coach Tom Kurucz, who pleaded guilty June 1 to one misdemeanor count of  dispensing steroids to players and a felony county of lying to a grand jury,  received the harshest sentence: six months in a halfway house and three years'  probation.  </P> <P> Former coaches Jim Washburn and Keith Kephart, along with John L. Carter of  Bethesda, Md., were each sentenced to three months in a halfway house and given  three-year probationary terms.  </P> <P> Assistant U.S. Atty. John Barton said he is satisfied with the sentences.  </P> <P> "I think what our investigation uncovered was very serious," Barton said. "But  it was probably less than what was played up in the press."  </P> <P> Kephart, Kurucz and Washburn declined comment.  </P> <P> Carter also declined comment, but one of his attorneys, Mitchell Rubenstein,  said he is disappointed with the sentence and believes that his client should  not have to serve any time.  </P> <P> Carter pleaded guilty on June 19 to two misdemeanor counts of providing the  muscle-building drug to former Gamecock football player Tommy Chaikin.  </P> <P> It was Chaikin's story in Sports Illustrated on Oct. 24 last year that prompted  a grand jury probe of alleged steroid use within the school's athletic  department.  </P></p>

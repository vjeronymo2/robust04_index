			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Japan, U.S. Urged To Move Toward Resuming Their </F> Framework Talks"]    [Text] On 29 March, the government decided on a "package  of external economic measures" aimed at further opening up the  Japanese market and relaxing the current regulations in a bid to  make Japan an open economic society.    Prime Minister Hosokawa briefed President Clinton on major  points of the package by telephone, and then expressed hopes to  resume the stalled Japan-U.S. economic framework talks.    The economic framework talks are in a cooling-off period  following the breakoff of the February Japan-U.S. summit talks.  Taking advantage of the cooling-off period, Japan has been  looking for clues on ways to resume the framework talks. The  door is not yet closed on the possibility of a resumption of the  framework talks. Now that Japan has announced plans for its  domestic reforms, both Japan and the United States should  seriously study ways to resume the framework talks.    Formal economic dialogue between Japan and the United States  remains stalled, which is not a desirable situation for the two  countries. Both the government and the private sector in Japan  have held running discussions on how to patch up bilateral  relations since the February Japan-U.S. summit talks broke off,  and this move is an expression of the view taken by the  government and the private sector in Japan that good Japan-U.S.  ties are indispensable for the development of the world economy.    We hope that both Japan and the United States will discuss  issues at home and abroad, make proposals for each other's  consideration, and work to defuse their economic friction at a  forum of the framework talks.    Notwithstanding, we do not highly rate all contents of the  package. The government will make a final decision on how to  implement the package in late June and on whether the package  lacks concrete steps to open up markets in Japan and relax the  bureaucratic regulations.    The government has decided to defer setting a voluntary  target to slash Japan's current account surplus in the package.  In the package, the government has clearly indicated a  declining trend in the ratio of Japan's current account surplus  to its GDP on the basis of its economic forecasting, and  envisioned the ratio at about 2.8 percent in 1994.    As for increasing the amount of public investment, the  government has not indicated how much the public investment will  be increased, but said it would review the basic plan for public  investment by June, while studying ways to increase public  investment and reexamining the conventional allotment of public  investment. On the issue of revamping the current tax system  and cutting income taxes, the government has said that it will  seek to reform the tax system within the year on the basis of a  conclusion that the ruling coalition parties will draw in June.    From the position of the bureaucrats who have mapped out the  package, mention of the ratio of Japan's current account surplus  to its GDP, together with reference to a review of the basic  plan for public investment in the package, may be a great step  forward. The question, however, is how much the prime  minister's political decisions and ideas have been incorporated  in the package. We would assume that since the prime minister  rebuffed the U.S. demand for setting numerical targets, it would  be proper for him to make more bold requests in the finalized  package.    Regarding deregulation, the government has clearly pointed  out priority areas, but said that it would compile records on  the results of the deregulation by the end of June. We see no  vigor in the government's plans to relax the regulations. The  government should relax the regulations as early as possible.    If there is a lack of political decision making on key  issues, no matter how favorably certain measures to open the  Japanese market compare with those of other industrialized  nations, the package of external economic measures as a whole  does not leave a good impression. We hope that the prime  minister will display his leadership by making an early decision  on a set of concrete measures to implement the package without  being complacent on a plan to map it out by June.    Meanwhile, the government has announced that it will abolish  Japan's voluntary restrictions on automobile exports to the  United States as of this year. The government has made the  announcement in accordance with an agreement worked out in the  new multilateral trade negotiations (the Uruguay Round), and it  can be said that the announcement is a symbol indicating that  Japan-U.S. economic relations are heading for a new era.    U.S. unilateral trade sanction measures like the Super 301  provision of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act run counter to the  objective of the Uruguay Round. We hope that the United States  will change its negotiating strategy of hinting at the  possibility of imposing sanctions on its trading partners.</p>

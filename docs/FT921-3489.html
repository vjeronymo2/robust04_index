Profits in the first half amounted to just Pounds 14,000 (Pounds 1.87m). There were exceptional redundancy and other reorganisation costs of Pounds 280,000 and interest took Pounds 1.35m (Pounds 1.46m). Earnings were halved to 11.6p (22.8p) and the directors propose to maintain the dividend for the year at 12.5p with an unchanged final of 9.5p. Turnover was a lower Pounds 65.2m (Pounds 68.6m).

			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> A TOUR DE FORCE;  </P> <P> NEW PACKAGING, VIGOROUS PROMOTION AND A TV DEAL IS PAYING OFF IN A BIG WAY FOR  BEACH VOLLEYBALL'S NEW GENERATION  </P> <P> Jay Hanseth got dinner and a trophy for winning the prestigious Laguna Beach  Open volleyball tournament in 1973.  </P> <P> "That was pretty good for then," says Jim Menges, who dominated the beach game  from the mid-1970s through the early 1980s. Menges' payday for winning the  Hermosa Beach Open with partner Matt Gage in 1980 was yogurt and a pitcher of  beer.  </P> <P> How things have changed.  </P> <P> Today's "King of the Beach," Sinjin Smith, is well on his way to becoming the  first millionaire in beach volleyball -- a sport in which prize money for top  players has increased more than 400% since 1985. Six players won more than  $100,000 on the tour last season.  </P> <P> That's a lot of frozen yogurt.  </P> <P> Smith and partner Randy Stoklos won $134,185 apiece last summer to top the  Assn. of Volleyball Professionals money standings. But Smith's growing wealth  has as much to do with diversity as it does athletic prowess. The winningest  player in beach volleyball history has a lucrative deal with a clothing  manufacturer, a coming book and instructional video, and an anticipated part in  a feature film.  </P> <P> Coming soon is a video game featuring the likenesses of Smith and Stoklos  called, naturally, "Kings of the Beach."  </P> <P> So how is this portfolio received by the local media when the AVP tour rolls  into Chicago, Cleveland and Rochester, N.Y. -- cities where the stars of a  quirky California sport might be expected to have amassed some fame, but  certainly not a fortune?  </P> <P> Smith laughs. "They just can't believe guys who grew up on the beach, play in  the sand, get tan and run around with no shirts on can get paid $150,000 or  $200,000 to do it."  </P> <P> But some do. And things aren't bad on the lower rungs of the money ladder,  either. After 16 years of playing for trophies and (sometimes) dinner, the game  has finally begun to pay off for Hanseth, at 36 the elder statesman of  professional beach volleyball.  </P> <P> Hanseth won $35,002 on the tour last season, good for 12th place in the money  standings. To earn what many deem a good living, he managed just one  third-place finish and twice came in fourth, but more often took fifth,  seventh, ninth, even 13th.  </P> <P> For Menges, who is just two years older than Hanseth but quit the beach game in  1982, the timing of volleyball's new professionalism was not so fortuitous.  Menges was there when the money arrived, winning beach volleyball's first two  World Championship events -- in 1976 with Greg Lee and in 1977 with Chris  Marlowe -- for a total of $2,500 in prize money. In one five-year stretch, he  failed to finish third or better in just one tournament, and in that one he was  fourth.  </P> <P> "I would never have had to work again," said Menges, who recently entered the  real estate field in Orange County after years of going from one job to the  next. "But that's just how things progressed. Now, you get seventh place every  weekend and make $35,000."  </P> <P> Menges could have added to that sponsorship and endorsement packages from  beachwear manufacturers that cover a player's travel expenses and sometimes pay  him a base salary -- contracts that can double or even triple a top player's  income.  </P> <P> "All I ever got was free trunks," Menges said.  </P> <P> In contrast, Smith got part ownership of a beachwear company.  </P> <P> It's more than a little symbolic that the guru of beach volleyball can no  longer be found on the sand courts south of Manhattan Beach pier or north of  Santa Monica, but instead occupies a law office on the 12th floor of a Century  City high rise. Leonard Armato, attorney for the likes of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar  and Phoenix Suns guard Kevin Johnson, is credited with taking the game uptown.  </P> <P> And, he says, there's no reason to stop at the city limits.  </P> <P> "Beach volleyball can go as far as just about any sport out there," says  Armato, the organizer and executive director of the AVP, whose latest coup was  obtaining nationwide cable television coverage of all 29 tournaments on this  year's schedule.  </P> <P> "When you keep in mind that volleyball is the second most popular sport in the  world, you know the beach game will continue to grow by leaps and bounds. It's  a good spectator sport and, with the exposure it's getting this year on  television, I think you're going to see it explode."  </P> <P> Armato's enthusiasm for the sport appears to go beyond the standard hype of an  agent or promoter. A former top-rated volleyball player himself, he graduated  from Mira Costa High in Manhattan Beach and played on the sand courts at the  foot of Marine Avenue. The same information can be found in the AVP bios of  veteran beach stars Mike Dodd and Jon Stevenson, among others.  </P> <P> So it's not surprising that the players came to Armato, 36, six years ago when  they became dissatisfied with their original promoter, Event Concepts.  </P> <P> Money, at the time, was still new to beach volleyball. According to former  player Jon Lee, now a volleyball writer and historian, prize money was  introduced to the game in a manner reminiscent of pro wrestling or  turn-of-the-century boxing. In the early 1970s, Jim Bartlett, a young publisher  and entrepreneur with a taste for beach volleyball, decided to make things more  interesting by placing a "bounty" on the top teams, Lee said.  </P> <P> "Each team would enter the tournament with bounties on their heads and, if you  beat them, you would win the bounty," said Lee, who coaches volleyball at San  Marcos High in Santa Barbara. "If the team won, they would retain their  bounty."  </P> <P> But it was Event Concepts that recognized the promotional power of beach  volleyball and introduced a more sophisticated method of compensating the  players. In 1976, the firm persuaded a corporate sponsor to put up a $5,000  purse for the first World Championship tournament and "professional" beach  volleyball was born.  </P> <P> For eight years Event Concepts promoted the beach tour, expanding corporate  sponsorship, modestly increasing the prize money and attracting the first cable  television coverage. But all was not well. The players, Dodd said at the time,  were "tired of being treated like nets and poles." They wanted more control and  more money.  </P> <P> Enter Armato. Under the direction of the attorney, the players formed the AVP  and, thus, became a single bargaining unit, one unified voice. And when Event  Concepts failed to meet the AVP's demands in the summer of 1984, the players  went on strike.  </P> <P> The aftermath of the AVP's boycott of the 1984 World Championship tournament in  Hermosa Beach brought total victory to the players. Event Concepts was out, the  corporate sponsors were persuaded to stay and the players had control of beach  volleyball.  </P> <P> "Essentially, (Event Concepts) was doomed from the start," Hanseth said. "They  saw the potential first; they saw thousands of people (attending tournaments)  and no money being made, and they brought in the sponsors. But eventually we  asked, 'What are they really offering us? Why not start a players' union, hire  our own promoter and give him a salary?' "  </P> <P> According to Armato, the AVP did just that for the next three years, hiring  another promoter, Group Dynamics Inc., and expanding the tour to 25 events with  $600,000 in prize money. But after the 1987 season, the players decided to cut  out the middle man and promote the tour themselves, dealing directly with the  sponsors.  </P> <P> "The AVP felt it could maximize the visibility of the sponsor and maximize the  benefit to the players without having the money diluted by a third party,"  Armato said. "And the prize money went from several hundred thousand dollars to  over a million overnight."  </P> <P> These results -- coupled with the AVP's corporate expansion into areas such as  merchandising, publishing and concessions -- have increased the players'  loyalty to Armato and their faith in his leadership, according to Stevenson.  </P> <P> "He's made all the right moves," Stevenson said. "He's made good decisions,  just about all of them have paid off and we're looking forward to what the  future may hold."  </P> <P> So is Armato, who predicts that television will allow volleyball to overcome  the limitations a beach sport might anticipate in a world that is largely  landlocked.  </P> <P> "Hockey is not as transmittable to television as volleyball is," said Armato,  who has already introduced the beach game to the shores of Lake Michigan and,  by bringing truckloads of sand to city parks, to places where there is no beach  of any kind. "And if television can do what it did for golf -- the most boring  sport in the history of the world -- imagine what it can do for us."  </P> <P> Jon Stevenson calls them the "thirtysomething guys." Smith, Dodd, Tim Hovland,  Pat Powers, Steve Obradovich, Hanseth and Stevenson himself. They are all 30  years old or older and dominate what is still perceived by many as a young  man's game -- meant to be played by teen-agers during those long summer days  before they must confront the realities of life.  </P> <P> The "thirtysomething guys" still play, Stevenson says, because they still win.  "It was just a generation of really good volleyball players," he said.  </P> <P> But he allows that their continued presence also has a lot to do with  perspective. The older players remember when a "career" in beach volleyball  meant sacrificing other real career opportunities. Some of life's realities  might not have been so bad, and casting them aside for a game that offered no  real future seemed unwise.  </P> <P> "People can't believe we're making this kind of money," said Stevenson, 31,  another $100,000 winner last season. "But for five years, I wasn't making more  than $10,000 or $20,000. Since college (at UC Santa Barbara), I always  considered going into the mainstream. I even did my first year of a master's  program in business. But I stuck with volleyball and it finally paid off."  </P> <P> "You just had to make a decision in life," said Dodd, Stevenson's teammate at  Mira Costa High who also survived the lean years to become a $100,000 player.  "If you were a young guy, you would scratch out a living at a job that allowed  you to go to the beach in the daytime. A lot of people worked in restaurants or  did real estate."  </P> <P> Those who remain from those days are the lucky ones, Stevenson says. "We're the  first guys who really made money at it. We're the ones who put our asses on the  line and went on strike, who gave up all those career opportunities to play  volleyball. We don't want to give it up yet. We want to go as long as we can."  </P> <P> But has the game changed along with the prize money?  </P> <P> "I think just about everything has changed," Stevenson said. "The only thing  that hasn't is that you still hit the ball three times."  </P> <P> Though he agrees with Smith, who stresses that "once you step onto the court,  it's the same game," Stevenson is as wistful for volleyball's past as he is  enthusiastic about its prosperous present.  </P> <P> "The spirit is just not there any more," he said. "It used to be more tied up  with the subculture of the beach. It used to be tied in with going to the  beach, surfing and having fun. Now, people are playing for different reasons. I  don't think many guys out there are not playing for the money.  </P> <P> "You can tell things have changed just by the conversation amongst the players.  It used to be, 'Where's the party?' Now, it's about permits for retaining  walls, remodeling houses, stocks going up or down. It's an entirely different  set of topics."  </P> <P> The results of the increased money, however, go well beyond court-side  conversation. "The big difference," Smith says, "is that it's much more  competitive out there. It used to be, 10 years ago or so, you could skate  through Saturday's games (before the final rounds Sunday). Now, you can't take  anyone lightly."  </P> <P> Stevenson agrees. "The depth of competition has really increased," he said.  "There are about 20 top-quality teams right now. All the way down to the  40th-ranked teams, you find players who are real serious about making it a  career. They're doing the little things -- diet, jump-training, lifting weights  -- to try to improve their game."  </P> <P> And if they make it, the "little things" will include negotiating with sponsors  over contract clauses, modeling beachwear for photo shoots and catching long  commercial airline flights. AVP events, sponsored by beer and tequila  companies, are now held in target marketing regions for those products rather  than traditional volleyball beaches like Laguna, State (north of Santa Monica)  and Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> "I saw the whole transition," Stevenson says. "Guys like Jim Menges and Matt  Gage were every bit as good as the top players today, and it's amazing they  could sacrifice as much as they did and get nothing back except personal  prestige."  </P> <P> For Jon Lee, who played more than 10 years but was never as successful as  brother Greg, money would have been nice, but the "esprit de corps" of the old  volleyball circuit may have been worth more.  </P> <P> "There was less material benefit," he said. "It was all pride and position in  the subculture that motivated you. It was just the respect of your peers and  love of the sport that you were playing for."  </P></p>

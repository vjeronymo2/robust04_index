			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Socialist Party Deputy Chairman Servet Pellumbi </F> to the Second Socialist Party National Conference in Tirana on 7  February: "The Socialist Party Toward New Developments in  Albanian Democracy"]    [Text] Comrade delegates and honored guests: We have  gathered at this conference to present our alternatives for  government at the present stage of transition and for overcoming  the current political crisis.    Our conference is one in a normal organizational series, but  the prolonged economic crisis and especially the tense political  situation that is seriously jeopardizing democracy, pluralism,  and normal political life in the country give it the dimensions  and importance of an extraordinary conference.    One can see everywhere the tangible consequences of such a  situation, in an unbridled and unprecedented war of words, in  the persecution of political opponents, in political murders  like that of Gjovalin Cekini in Shkoder on 14 January, down to  the arrest and illegal and anticonstitutional detention in  prison for political motives of the deputy Fatos Nano, our  party's chairman.    It is nevertheless to the credit and honor of the Socialist  Party [PSSh] that, as a party whose symbol is a rose, it has  been able to preserve a cool head and maintain its political  balance, presenting itself at home and abroad as a mature  political force, responsible for the nation's destiny, and with  wide popular support. With a highly developed sense of  dedication and tangible commitment to the progress of democracy  in Albania, even though in opposition, it has continually sent  out a message of understanding, tolerance and democratic  cooperation. Here at our Second National Conference is a  political force with credibility for the future.    Our party now spreads throughout the country and includes,  not just notionally but in reality, more than 100,000 members  grouped in 3,720 party organizations. In 1993 alone, more than  3,000 new members were admitted to its ranks. The massive  Eurosocialist Youth Forum and the Socialist Women's Forum, which  give a truly democratic spirit to the PSSh's structures, are  evidence of the party's present and future strength. The  admission of our Eurosocialist Youth Forum as an observer at the  Socialist Youth International is a deserved sign of appreciation  and a joy for us all, for which we send our warm congratulations  from the platform of this conference!    We are nevertheless aware that successfully confronting the  challenges of the times will in the future demand increasing  attention to the party's standards and its work, calling for a  party that will accompany diversity of opinion, a vigorous  democratic life within its ranks, and a courageous commitment in  all its structures with exemplary discipline and organization,  very different from the models of centralist parties with a  rigorous class character. We are determined to build on what we  have achieved, in order always to have a party that is  responsible for its duties and up to its well known option of  democratic socialism.  <H5>  A New Political Settlement -- A Demand of the Times </H5>   The political life of our country is marked by phenomena and  contradictions that indicate an increasing restriction of the  scope of democracy. The political struggle is being waged with  great intensity, savagery, and a marked lack of dialogue and  consensus, fraught with severe historical and contemporary  prejudices. The Democratic Party [PD] is using a new class  struggle as its main instrument for maintaining power. The PD  strikes at diversity of opinion, the opposition, views that  oppose or compete with those of the state, and all those who  think differently accompanying all this with the outlines of a  police state.    The PD is responsible for the currently tense political  situation in the country. Even though, for demagogy and  political rhetoric, it does not hesitate to say "good morning"  to the opposition, in reality it is attempting to paralyze every  kind of opposition, including even the parties with which it is  formally in coalition. The marked absence of will to create the  political leeway for social compromise has led it into the  absurd position of rejecting every other alternative and all  forms of cooperation and tolerance. It is showing the mentality  and practices of a one-party state everywhere and in almost  everything.    As a result, the PD can no longer conceal its failure as a  political force that equated itself with democracy or hide its  inability to correct itself and its lack of confidence, ideas,  and solutions. Chill disillusionment and a mass flight from its  ranks have become a growing protest against the many illusions  that its spread with its promises and its programs.    In an attempt to cope with its identity crisis, it is merely  pursuing paths that deepen it further. Authoritarian centralism  of power, a strengthening of the executive at the expense of  parliament, the blockade of local government, and the creation  of intermediary links in the shape of directorates appointed by  and dependent on the central authorities are among the main  signs of the crisis of the PD's government, as are the  violations of democracy and the abuses of the people's free  votes. The corruption of the members of government lifts them  above the poverty of ordinary people, and cannot fail to be at  the latter's expense. The PD's rule is now in political and  institutional crisis, and it cannot emerge from this with the  help of piecemeal repairs and patches, as the president is  attempting to do with his aim of rescuing the PD's "top  political command."    The open subjugation of the judiciary to the executive and  the party-state is another highly dangerous and very disturbing  phenomenon in our society today. The forced approval through  the use of majority voting cards of some antidemocratic laws  such as 24-1, the Press Law, and the totalitarian-style  amendments to the Penal Code add to this disquieting phenomenon.    The violation of human rights and freedoms has become the  most dangerous and disturbing phenomenon for our society. The  mass dismissal of PSSh members and sympathizers from organs of  the state and other institutions, even academic institutions,  through the use of the antidemocratic 24-1 law, mass  unemployment, court proceedings against journalists including  members of the PSSh's forums, physical violence against some  PSSh deputies, savage police terror and violence even inside  police stations that has in some cases led to irreparable  physical injury and even death, have become very worrying  phenomena. Only in totalitarian states are counter rallies  held, deputies are forbidden to meet their electorate, people  are imprisoned for taking part in peaceful rallies and protests,  or even just because they go to the cemeteries of the nation's  martyrs, as happened on 29 November last year in Durres,  Gjirokaster, and elsewhere. The radio and television have  virtually closed their doors to the PSSh.    For five months now, the police throughout Albania have been  rejecting on the most absurd pretexts the PSSh's applications to  hold rallies in city squares. The example of Tirana, where the  police have refused nine applications by the PSSh Managing  Committee (on the final occasion with an unprecedented  demonstration of force) clearly demonstrates the significant and  worrying narrowing of the scope of democracy in our country.    The arrest and political imprisonment of Fatos Nano, PSSh  chairman and People's Assembly deputy, marks the culmination of  flagrant violations of human rights and freedoms. The manner in  which he was accused, the time at which this charge was raised,  his arrest a few days after the removal of his immunity and a  few hours before the PSSh's peaceful and authorized rally, the  replacement of two prosecutors in order to carry out the order  for his arrest, his arrest by a newly-appointed prosecutor, his  detention in prison under a harsh police regime, and the return  of his file by the court because of lack of facts and evidence  as a result of the investigating group's prior judgment of the  case -- all these things show that Fatos Nano has been arrested  as an opponent of the regime and has been imprisoned for  political revenge and in order to attain definite political  goals, to divide and liquidate the PSSh. However, such goals can  never be attained, not today, and not tomorrow! This is our  viewpoint. This is the will of the PSSh's members and  supporters!    The powerful support of more then 700,000 members of the  Albanian electorate who gave their signatures for the release of  Fatos Nano and the broad support of well-known democratic  organizations in Europe that have considered the "Nano affair" a  political matter are proof to us of the justice of our stand.  On this basis, we have demanded and demand from this conference  too Fatos Nano's immediate release. This is a legitimate and  democratic demand, and not an indicator of any "passion for  creating cults!" We have never identified the party with  individuals, whoever they may be. This matter has for us the  value and weight of a principle!    Comrade delegates, faced with such a reality, the PSSh has  played its vital and historic role for democracy as a  constructive opposition, a force that expresses and defends  broad social interests and an alternative that is well known in  Europe. The PSSh is intensively struggling and working with  legal means and democratic methods, not to bring back the old  system, which failed and will never return, but to ensure the  normal conduct of the transition and a changeover to a genuinely  democratic society. In this sense, we as an opposition have not  been the PD's "editors," but the "creators," of course not the  only ones, of the Albanian political scene. Also, from the  political struggle that has been waged so far, the PSSh has  emerged more mature, more consolidated, and clearer in  programing how its work is to be carried out. It now enjoys  broad national and international support.    We have never viewed the struggle between political forces,  particularly between the two main ones, the PD and the PSSh, as  a struggle between opposing systems or between mutually  exclusive poles, but as a competition of alternatives and  concrete solutions for the difficult problems of the transition.  In our view, it has never been said that competitors should  necessarily be each other's enemies. The PD leaders, especially  certain extremist sections in its government, cannot manage to  understand this. Certain representatives of these sections, who  pay only lip service to pluralism, do not even flinch from such  statements as "Albania will never again allow itself to be led  by the PSSh," thus further inciting divisions among the people.    On this occasion, we would like to return to the familiar  principle that in a democratic country the opposition does not  exist at the mercy of those in power, but is a legal and vitally  important factor for the functioning of society and the defense  of national interests and the basic values and principles of  democracy. Whoever genuinely feels responsible for the  country's fate must not behave demagogically with the opposition  and must not resemble someone who "stabs you in the night and  mourns you in the morning."    It is precisely these developments that disturb people, who  are increasingly asking what is going on, where are we heading,  how we will get over this excessively tense situation, how  democracy will be defended and developed, how the crisis will be  brought to an end, and whether or not the road will be opened  toward stability, economic revival, employment, higher labor  productivity, and the living standards without which there can  be no genuine democracy.    In order to provide an answer to such reasonable questions,  the PSSh today reemphasizes its political alternative. We aim  thereby, first of all, to say "no" to confrontation, social  tensions, the persecution of political opponents, corruption,  and every other negative and antidemocratic phenomenon that  threatens to become a social blight. Second, we give a powerful  "yes" to a new political settlement in Albania, economic reform,  democratic tolerance, pluralism, national understanding, social  peace, and everything else that will assist Albania's dignified  integration into a changing and developing world.    We think that the country today finds itself in a phase when  the overthrow of the old, failed communist system has on a  political plane come to an end, and is irreversible. It  therefore follows that the strategy of political tension and  confrontation that the ruling PD persists in following is not  only outdated, but also extremely harmful and dangerous, because  a basic orientation toward carrying out the economic reform, and  all that means, guides all the Albanian political forces today.    That is why the foundation of our political alternative  rests  upon the conclusion that the basis of a secure and prosperous  future requires the responsibility of all political forces, the  compilation of an anticrisis program, and a strategy of economic  and institutional reform, scientifically based and with broad  social support.    In order to achieve this, to further promote the  establishment of a democratic society in Albania, and to unblock  the economy, it is our belief that it must be admitted that the  premature political and moral exhaustion of the PD regime is a  real fact, and that it has become imperative to create a new  political balance and a new formula for government.    New elections! That is our demand today. That is our  slogan of the day! We will struggle for these with democratic  means, for the sake of democracy. Our demand for early  elections at a time when the PD holds sway as an undemocratic  force that admits no alternative, is neither anticonstitutional,  antidemocratic, nor destabilizing, but in harmony with the  dialectic of transition and the state of our institutions. We  ask for elections for the sake of stabilizing the country, the  defense of the country, and national affirmation.    We see that such a thing is common practice in other  countries, even in countries famous for their democratic  traditions. The PSSh's demand to put the political forces to  the test once gain is therefore not exceptional, and is hampered  by no constitutional obstacle. Article 28, Item Nine of the  Main Constitutional Dispositions provides for and permits the  dissolution of parliament by the president and the announcement  of early elections.    Besides, in a period of transition such as this, there are  many factors that prompt such an idea or could in practice lead  to early elections. First of all, there is the economic factor,  the economic crisis. When electors voted for the PD on 22 March  [1992] with the motto, "Let's give the PD a try," they were  thinking of the PD's promises to extract the country from its  deep economic crisis and to create the necessary stability to  pave the way for economic development.    Of course, the PD's two-year period in power has not been  enough to fully achieve such an aim. However, it is enough time  for the electorate to see whether the government and its  management for affairs are heading in the right direction,  whether the government shows dedication, and whether it has  placed able and uncorrupted people in positions of power. We  must admit that people's massive disillusionment in the PD and  its government is entirely well- grounded. This was evident on  26 July 1992, when local government elections were held, in  which not only the majority of the electorate voted for the  PSSh's candidates, but there was a significant increase in the  number of people not going to the polls. Since that time, the  pressure for change among the electorate has been rising, and we  will not prejudge the issue by saying whether or not this is  entirely to the benefit of our party.    At the same time, it must be said that the balance of forces  within the PD itself has changed, with the departure from it of  the group of "motionists," who formed the Democratic Alliance,  and most recently, the departure of a realistic right-wing  group, which is expected to form its own party. Changes have  also occurred within other parties that did not achieve  parliamentary representation. Such changes cannot fail to bring  not only confusion, if not a situation of crisis, to the  Albanian parliament, but also a significant decline in its  authority and effectiveness. The Albanian parliament today does  not reflect the country's political and electoral balance.    In response to these changes and this deep disproportion,  and  bearing in mind that the ruling party shows no readiness to  cooperate with other political forces, especially of the  opposition, in order to solve the many acute problems common to  our society (and cooperation does not necessarily mean a  government coalition), we have issued now well-known proposals:    1. Let the parliament approve as soon as possible the  Albanian constitution, seeing this as a condition to guarantee  the operation of all democratic institutions and mechanisms of  the state and the judiciary, as well as for Albania's  integration in the Council of Europe and other international  organizations. We consider it necessary for the constitution to  be subjected to the people's judgment and vote of confidence.  Therefore, during the general elections, let the people also be  given the opportunity to vote on the Albanian constitution.    2. Let a "roundtable" of parties start work in order discuss  how to relieve the tension of the situation and to establish the  equilibrium that has been so seriously upset. We think that the  holding of early elections before this autumn would be the sole  constitutional way to reach a new political settlement. For  this, we propose the approval of a paraelectoral social pact  that will ensure that the elections are held in a calm political  situation.    The General Management Committee thought of singling out  these two demands from the others, not only in order to indicate  their importance, but also to give the conference the  opportunity to express its view of them, and to say whether we  agree to put them at the center of our action program this year.  We take the view that these two demands require a total  commitment from us, from all the PSSh structures, the  Eurosocialist Youth Forum, and the Socialist Women's Forum, in  publicizing the PSSh's achievements as a political force that  knows no generation gap and has the ability to govern because it  knows how to cooperate and to give the best alternative, in  sounding out the electorate through frequent and lively  meetings, in drawing up draft programs that will be as concrete  as possible, and in selecting able candidates who enjoy the  voters' support and trust, etc.    In the present situation, the General Management Committee  also believes that the work of the PSSh parliamentary group  claims priority, alongside cooperation with other political  forces and such associations as those of the National Liberation  War veterans, the war and labor invalids, the former prisoners  and victims of political persecution, the Albanian Confederation  of Trade Unions, and others. The PSSh again publicly declares  that it respects every officially-recognized organization and  association, because these are a product and necessary  ingredient of democracy. It is open and ready to cooperate with  them both locally and centrally. The nation and the development  of the country, now as never before, require new and broad scope  for cooperation and understanding among all representatives of  society.    We are open to dialogue and cooperation with all political  forces on the basis of the principles of equality among parties,  whether great or small; of mutual trust and respect accompanied  by a concern not to turn differences into obstacles to  cooperation but into impulses toward finding a common language  on definite issues; and of noninterference of one party in the  affairs of another.    As so far, so in the future too, we will not hesitate, on  the  basis of these principles, to support just standpoints of the  Democratic Alliance, the Social Democratic Party, the National  Unity Party, the Popular Party, the Social Workers Party, the  Agrarian Party, and even the PD and its government, just as we  have always welcomed every standpoint of theirs that supports  our alternatives, or criticizes them and presents other  alternatives that are more realistic than ours. Such  cooperation is to the benefit of democracy and the social peace  that is so necessary, and does not constitute a kind of "anti-PD  bloc," as the PD executive chairman hastened to call it. We use  this opportunity to tell the PD that, if you feel isolated, you  should look for the reason in your party and government, because  finding room for cooperation is the ABC of a genuine democratic  society, showing the ability of a political force to govern.    Room for cooperation in a genuinely democratic society can  and must be found, but this requires the will and tolerance on  all sides. In particular, no political force must lack this  will as far as the national cause is concerned. So far, the  political parties and certain groups both "affiliated" and  "nonaffiliated" have devised theories and have also organized  some political activities on the subject of national  conciliation and unification. The PSSh has also several times  come out in favor of this splendid initiative. However, the  influence of this initiative is not evident in our  sociopolitical life. One can even occasionally notice the  opposite.    Our option is for all the pan-Albanian political forces to  talk and to agree on two essential matters: first, a single  national platform, and second, a long-term plan of action to  realize the national cause. The time has come to put an end to  this centuries- old delay, and for the Albanian political  parties, all together, to take up the banner of pan national  consensus as the first step toward national unification.  <H5>  The Social Market Economy -- The PSSh's Priority Alternative </H5>   Almost three years ago, when the Albanian economy was at the  nadir of its crisis, the PSSh's program aimed to achieve two  main goals: the stabilization of the economy and its orderly  and carefully-considered transition to a social market economy.  However, as is well known, political developments brought the PD  to the leadership of political life in Albania, and the PD  represented and began implementing its economic program based on  the famous theory of "shock-therapy."    We do not say that there have been no successes at all  during its two years in power. We appreciate the work done to  draft and approve legislation that aims to establish a market  economy in our country. Another positive feature has been the  creation of a new class of businessmen who are increasingly  assuming importance in the economic reform. The reining in of  the inflation rate, although accomplished mainly by  administrative rather than effective economic methods, has been  a step that should be followed by other more effective ones.    However, we think that these and a few other achievements  are  first of all a result of the fact that Albania has now embarked  on the road of irreversible transformations, and all Albanians  and all political forces have been involved in them. Second,  these achievements are not such as to justify the euphoria and  demagogic exaggeration of successes and the concealment of  failures in which the ruling party indulges, attempting to  create an atmosphere in which people become accustomed to the  crisis by saying, "Albania is all right with the PD, don't ask  for any more!" With regret, but with a feeling of realism, we  must admit that the PD program, which is based on neoliberalism,  monetarism, the myth of the free market, and on the hope to  stabilize the economy fast and to solve everything with help  from abroad, in other words on one sidedness and haphazardness,  is not as successful in our country as it is portrayed. The  medium-term program put forward by the Meksi Government shows  this very clearly. "The Albanian miracle" in the implementation  of "shock therapy" has now failed, as also happened in other  countries of East Europe.    The measures taken by the Meksi Government to control the  crisis, beyond a strenuously-applied brake on the inflation  rate, have not hit their targets: Production remains in general  at minimal levels, far below the level of 1989 (although it is  said that its decline has been halted); unemployment has  reached the colossal figure of 44.5 percent of the able-bodied  population, or about 400,000 people, while living standards have  fallen more than 40 percent in one year, because the prices of  consumer goods have risen nine- or 10-fold, while pay has only  risen two- or three-fold. The foreign debt has risen from $400  million to $625 million and is continuing to rise fast because  of the very serious foreign trade deficit.    The galloping internal debt has totally asphyxiated the  operations of enterprises. The market demand for goods and  services is mainly ascribable to foreign-currency remittances  from economic emigrees, a normal mechanism of the free market  when the value of the lek falls in relation to goods on the  domestic market, while it is artificially revalued in relation  to foreign currencies. The state of public finances remains  serious, and public finance relies solely on additions to the  variety and size of taxes and on emergency interventions from  the sale of state assets accumulated by the people for almost  five decades. Meanwhile, the opportunities for the state and  for investment credit for the expansion of production are very  low. The failures to solve such vital problems as water,  electricity, and fuel supplies, housing, and the health service,  and the failure to guarantee minimum living conditions have  become intolerable for ordinary people.    It can no longer be said that the economic crisis through  which we are living is solely a result of the legacies of the  past, because it is also a result of the policies pursued by the  ruling PD in these two years of efforts to roughly shift us into  a market economy. The incompetence of members of the  government, the maladministration of foreign aid, and the lack  of the hoped-for foreign investments led to the failure of such  a course; the PD is therefore hastening, in the midst of this  confusion, to make what "self-corrections" are possible, and  even to talk about the "social economy of the market," which has  now been reduced to a "welfare economy" without prospects.    Being much more realistically aware of the critical state of  the economy than the party in power, the PSSh declares that it  considers the reforms irreversible, but that it is necessary, as  they are carried out, to make the necessary corrections. The  PSSh is also a political force that is able to draw up and to  present to the country its own alternative that ensures more  successful solutions to the current and forthcoming problems of  the economic reform.    The two fundamental axes of the PSSh's economic program  remain the control of the economic and social crisis and the  structural transformation of the economy in order to establish a  social market economy.    Of course, the social market economy is neither an "abstract  notion" nor a "play on words." The concept of the social market  economy is much deeper than that which leaders of our right-wing  leaders occasionally sneer at, as they attempt out of demagogy  and political opportunism to equate it with some funds for  social welfare which, in our country's case, would not suffice  even to keep alive for six to 12 months our country's hundreds  of thousands of unemployed. Nor is a social market economy made  by adding a few public holidays, which are given to us by  history or by God! Still less can it be achieved by the  five-day week at a time when production and productivity are at  very low levels.    The social market economy is now a theoretical and practical  alternative that is mostly supported and implemented by  political forces of a social-democratic tendency, which  understand by the term a correction of capitalism in order to  make it a humane society in which it becomes possible to achieve  a genuine political democracy and an genuine economic democracy,  a society that gives individuals equal opportunities and in  which freedom of the citizen coexists with social  responsibility, and a remuneration of ability with social  solidarity and a struggle against poverty under the state's  supervision. The social market economy is an economic model  based on private property, whose sanctity we will defend with  the law, and on free initiative and competition, but which does  not exclude a variety of forms of ownership, the public sector,  and other forms of ownership administered according to the  principles of the market economy.    Relying on such an understanding of the social market  economy, we Socialists place at the foundation of our economic  alternative the idea of the new role of the democratic state,  which obliquely intervenes in the economy with the aim of giving  the market social and humane dimensions and guaranteeing the  predominance of private property by creating total scope for the  competition of all kinds of ownership. We are for a society  that will be based on the logic of profit but at the same time  on a logic of social solidarity, on a dynamic combination of the  self-regulating mechanisms of the market and factors that  balance the market's shortcomings.    In our economic alternative, the state will be required to  devise the theoretical instruments for an anti-crisis reform  program, but it will in particular determine measures for their  practical implementation in two interrelated phases:    In the first phase, in accordance with the mechanism of the  market economy, by giving continual regulatory nudges, while  strategically, in the second phase, when the economy has assumed  its normal form and will be close to using its potential, it  will move to self-regulation.    The concept of property also lies at the basis of our  economic alternative, with concrete programs to transform,  restructure, and develop it, in order to lay the foundations of  a mixed economy in which private and public property will  coexist, confronting the competition of the market.    Privatization is for us too a basic component of the  economic  reform and a cardinal precondition for the creation of a market  economy. However, the PSSh does not see it as a goal in itself  or as the sole road. We are not for "total privatization," as  it is normally put, but for the fastest possible privatization,  while aiming at the decentralization of some enterprises,  transforming them entirely and making them public, independent,  and productive both nationally and locally, so that "a state of  the best kind" may act in the economic field as a normal  shareholder and a market agent, and so that there will be  respect for the coexistence of the private sector and the public  sector, which will gradually be wound down in favor of the  private.    Our strategy in this direction remains the use of such  methods as will be able to ensure, not the destruction and  looting of property, as is happening, but a managerial  transformation and a considered privatization that will  guarantee the restructuring and revival of the economy. Our  motto in this direction is, "Not change and privatization in  order to simply change the owner, but in order to secure more  production and more employment."    The PSSh considers to be illegal the privatization of more  than 500 small and medium-sized state enterprises by government  decrees, or by local privatization boards, without action and  openly in the favor of certain individuals and groups. It  promises to review the mistakes committed in the course of this  process, and to redress all injustices with the help of modern  legislation.    The PSSh has relied for its privatization program as a whole  on the best European experience. This program also anticipates  the privatization of large state enterprises, aiming at making  property owners out of the largest number of citizens.    The PSSh favors privatization on the basis of vouchers  assessed on the basis of the contribution, direct or indirect,  of everybody who has labored and sweated to create this wealth  during the last five decades. Bearing this in mind, we say that  only the parliament elected by the people must legally decide on  the distribution of this wealth, in order to avoid injustices  and social tensions, whether old or new. This will mean that  the correction of the injustices of the past will not lead to  new injustices and social tensions. We do not see privatization  as a return to the economy of 1938, but as a premise for putting  ourselves on the lines of an up- to-date European economy.    The PSSh has come out against the PD's idea of privatizing  everything. We think that the most sensitive sectors such as  hydroelectric stations, mining, oil, the railroads,  telecommunications, military industries, urban utilities, etc.,  should remain in public ownership. This stems from the idea of  the new role of the democratic state in the social market  economy and the need for a variety of forms of ownership, with  the natural aim of creating total scope for competition and free  initiative.    In short, the PSSh's economic alternative will, in changing  the course of the economic reform, aim to simultaneously achieve  three main objectives:    a) The maximal and effective mobilization of all our  resources and assets, seeing this as the core of an anticrisis  program.    b) Continuing to restructure the economy in order to adapt  it as fast as possible to the demands of the market.    c) Guaranteeing the activities and high and stable profits  of domestic and foreign capital.    Such changes in the course of the economic reform, seen both  macro- and microeconomically, will be accompanied by the  drafting and implementation of a range of concrete policies and  solutions.    Thus, the PSSh does not view restraining inflation as an end  in itself or in isolation from such social problems as high  unemployment. We are for the optimal balance between these two  indicators, and for a level of inflation that will reduce  unemployment to 10-15 percent, i.e. slightly more than in other  European countries. Our country's academics and economists are  able to draft and implement programs for the maximal and  effective mobilization of all our resources, deepening the  restructuring of our economy for its fastest possible adaptation  to the demands of the world market, guaranteeing high and stable  profits for foreign capital alongside a higher spirit of  cooperation and partnership, unfreezing economic emigration.    Particular attention must be devoted to the effective  reactivization of some sectors of industry such as mines,  mineral processing, engineering, light industry, the food  industry, tourism, etc., in which it is anticipated that large  numbers of people both in the towns and the countryside will  find work.    In these directions, the PSSh is planning national,  regional,  and local programs to create new jobs, bearing particularly in  mind the areas most affected by unemployment and a legacy of  poverty.    It is well known that the liberalization of prices and their  free determination by the market on the basis of supply and  demand have significantly increased the cost of living, because  the government has not allowed pay to follow the movement of  prices. The PSSh favors an elastic policy in this, and believes  that the free determination of prices should be followed by the  necessary adjustments in the system of wages, pensions, social  welfare, etc.    Our economy is not prepared to cope with the normal  operation  of the prices and wages mechanism, which is at present  influenced by foreign production factors, earnings from  emigration, international prices, customs tariffs, and currency  exchange rates. Under these conditions, the state must now and  again intervene in order to avoid possible speculative and  undeserved profits. It is also necessary to maintain state  guaranteed prices for the procurement of agricultural and dairy  products, with the aim of encouraging the development of the  products and byproducts the market demands.    As for pay, we favor a better appreciation of intellectual  labor; reasonable differentials, in accordance with the economic  situation, between high and low pay; a minimum wage calculated  on the basis of a minimum subsistence; and wage freedom in the  private sector, all to be regulated by laws approved in  parliament.    The PSSh favors a credit, fiscal, and customs policy that  will aim to stimulate and do what is possible to protect the  domestic market for agricultural and industrial production,  whether of traditional kinds or those "in their infancy." It  also favors expanding the private sector and employing tens and  hundreds of thousands of people in towns and centers of  employment.    Fiscal policy must be regulated in two main directions:  first, in order to stimulate and protect the development of  domestic production and the equilibrium of the market and supply  and demand. This would be helped by the establishment of a  progressive taxation system and the replacement of turnover tax  by a value-added tax. The second direction involves tightening  the taxation administration in order to administrate revenue in  the best possible way through improved financial control, and a  struggle against corruption and improper profits that damage the  interests of the state and of working people. A policy of  reducing the budget deficit must take more care to distribute  the burden better between the productive and the retail and  service sectors. As part of a social market economy, we will  reform the banking system, a financial institution with an  irreplaceable role, by using the instruments of money, credit,  and the financial market (in money and securities), in order to  stabilize and further develop the range of production and to  develop international economic relations and investments.    The establishment of local government on a stable and  independent economic basis is a basic problem for us Socialists.  We think that this is not simply a question of a skeletal law  or a "local" budget that depends almost entirely on the  government and the ministries, but an issue that demands a total  regulation of the prerogatives of popular self-government and  the assets and financial resources of these authorities, which  will, on one hand, oblige and encourage these authorities to  manage their productive activities and their natural resources,  and also to confront and solve the many key problems of public  services in the towns and the countryside.    A special policy will be devised favoring the countryside,  especially the poor mountain regions. This will be supported by  a range of concessionary policies for prices, loans,  agricultural machinery, and nitrate fertilizers, and by devising  and introducing at the proper time a customs and taxation system  that will not only cover the fiscal aspect, as happened with the  decree of the Meksi Government. We aim "to give oxygen" to  Albanian agricultural and livestock production, or those  products and trades for which every opportunity exists and where  we do not lack a tradition. The PSSh opposes introducing taxes  for the peasantry in 1994.    This conclusion is based on the current situation of  agriculture and the countryside in general, which is in reality  quite different from what those in power claim. The state of  the countryside is serious. Land distribution has stuck at 70  percent, while official spokesmen claim that it has reached 95  percent. The countryside and agricultural production cannot set  off on the right road without title deeds being distributed.    Albanian agriculture is still not in a position to secure  bread and other products for the rural population, let alone the  towns. The irrigation network has been to a large extent  destroyed, the seed distribution system does not work, and the  production of chemical fertilizer has sunk to the levels of  several decades ago. The overwhelming majority of private  peasants, especially those a long way from the towns, do not  have any opportunity to send their produce to market. At the  same time, peasants are obliged to buy industrial goods at  European prices.    Our policy for the development of sheep-farming also aims at  alleviating these areas today. Millions of dollars are today  leaving Albania in order to import agricultural and dairy  products that we used to export until yesterday, and can be  produced at home; meanwhile, no ways are being found, no  financially considered economic ways and means, to invest these  millions in Albania, in agriculture, tourism, and other sectors.    We want to correct the anticonstitutional and illegal steps  that were taken to destroy the agricultural enterprises. The  parliament must issue a comprehensive law to cover these major  assets of 200,000 hectares, which used to account for 25 percent  of the country's agricultural production.    It is clear to everybody that Albanian agriculture cannot  progress and achieve European levels divided into about 500,000  individual plots; we therefore, in time, support the idea of  the modern organization of private agricultural production.    We think that the future of democracy and the market economy  in Albania depends on the abilities the political forces will  show in devising and developing a social infrastructure and  up-to-date systems of education, health, culture, social  security, consumer protection, etc., things we regretfully note  have been neglected or destroyed. The PSSh has devoted more  attention than any other political force to human concerns and  to the social dimension of the market economy, on the basis of  the fact that we are faced with a marked deterioration of the  social position of increasingly broad strata of our society;  that 20 percent of urban families, or one in five, are totally  destitute and receive no income other than what they receive as  welfare; and that services in health, education, culture, etc.,  are less and less well covered.    We think that the economic reform can only be crowned with  success if we show ourselves sensitive to human concerns, or, in  other words, to the social costs of the reform. This is the  reason that has impelled us not to rest content with compiling  the most up- to-date social program possible, but to insist on  realizing it on the basis of the new political settlement that  we propose.    For example, the PSSh's alternative in the field of  education  lays down the goal of reforming and modernizing the educational  system at all levels, in content and in structure, and  completing the relevant legislation to make education open,  democratic, secular, and modern. The broad basis of the  education of Albanian citizens will continue to be in state  schools. In this context, the educational rights of the  minorities will be respected. Education will be paid for and  conducted by the state. Private education will be permitted by  law and its curricula will be subject to state standards. This  will also be true of foreign schools. The criterion for  employment and for promotion to supervisory responsibility at  all levels of the schools will be professional ability. The  status of a teacher and lecturer, of a school pupil and college  student, and the duties of a parent in his relationship with the  school, will be covered by a PSSh legislative initiative.  Cooperation in European projects and the twinning of our schools  and universities with those in foreign countries will remain an  important resource in the future too.    In its program for health, the PSSh will rely on the  principle that every citizen will receive the health care he  requires, regardless of his social position or economic level.    Faced with the economic condition of a state that cannot  promise adequate budget resources for health, the idea of health  insurance, dependent on income, will be gradually introduced, as  the only way to achieve a modern medical service, the best  possible pay for health personnel, and also the basic  preconditions for a struggle against corruption in the health  sector. The aim will be to improve all three levels of the  health service, and to devote particular attention to the  modernization of preventive medicine and the emergency service.    By means of the social security system, we aim to offer  protection against the perils of age, illness, accidents,  invalidity, unemployment, and at the same time the poverty in  which certain strata of society will continue to find  themselves. The social security system at which we aim combines  personal responsibility and social solidarity. Its structure  will be subdivided into insurance, solidarity funds, aid, etc.,  and also for different ages and professions. We will care for  war veterans according to the same standards other European  countries adopt toward those who contributed to the struggle  against fascism.    At a time when cultural and academic contacts with other  countries are increasing, our state and society have the duty to  maintain and support our national cultural identity. We  therefore favor support for the dignified revival of central  institutions of pan-national importance such as the Academy of  Sciences, the National Theater, the Opera and Ballet Theater,  Albanfilm, the Naim Frasheri Publishing House, the central  museums, etc. This will be supplemented by cooperation between  the central institutions and social organizations, by agreements  with international organizations and associations, and also by  demanding a certain quota from private enterprises.    In this same area, the PSSh alternative provides for  certain specific measures for the intelligentsia, for the  operation of existing academic institutions and their increased  cooperation with individual European bodies and projects, the  maintenance of high university numbers, legislative and economic  incentives for the private sector to invest in academic  institutions, improved pay and welfare for intellectuals with  high levels of postgraduate qualifications, and the legal  protection of authors' copyright within Albania and abroad, etc.    In conclusion, the PSSh declares that its alternative gives  optimal solutions to the problems that have accumulated during  our country's economic crisis, and that it is able to confront  the challenges of the times in this difficult transition period.  Nevertheless, it defends the view that the country requires  medium- term and long-term macroeconomic guidelines that cannot  be included within the framework of the program of an individual  government of whatever party. These guidelines require a broad  consensus and we will be unsparing in our commitment and efforts  to achieve this.  <H5>  For an Active and Realistic Foreign Policy </H5>   The PSSh has assembled a broad and realistic vision  regarding  both foreign policy and the influence of foreign factors on the  successful realization of the reforms in Albania. It has  clearly expressed its stands in its program documents and in its  daily work. Therefore, without pretending to give a total  overview of foreign policy, we would wish merely to stress  certain objections and priorities.    We value the steps that have been taken to overcome  Albania's  foreign isolation and support the development of the process of  international relations as well as efforts to establish a new  order of peace and stability that will exclude all kinds of  political, national, economic, ethnic, or religious conflict  among countries and peoples, especially in our tense region.    The PSSh once again takes the opportunity to express  gratitude to the countries and states of Europe, the United  States, China, and the countries of the Islamic community for  the help they have given to our country in this difficult period  of transition. We appreciate the continually active roles of  the EU, the Western European Union, and more broadly, that of  the CSCE, not only in the process of economic renewal, but also  politically and in support of our national cause.    We hold fast to the view that new geopolitical realities  have  brought regional factors to the fore. Our foreign policy in  this field should therefore be marked by dynamic equilibrium.  We view regional factors as extensions of nonregional factors  of European and Atlantic security. We cannot respond to this  situation with the haphazard and amateur enthusiasm of much of  our foreign policy, over which we have already expressed our  objections. The priorities given to chance opportunities have  detracted from the work of Albanian diplomacy, and brought a  kind of chill in relations with Europe, a chill that cannot be  hidden by spectacular scenes at airports and numbers of  handshakes.    Relations with neighboring countries also constitute a  priority that can never be neglected, and we must therefore  continually be making efforts to ensure we are always friends  with these countries, bringing problems out into the open and  solving them, but above all not allowing the creation of new  problems that cool relations.    The political conditions in the region are not those of four  or five years ago. The war, the unprecedented violence of the  Serbian chauvinists in Bosnia and other areas of the former  Yugoslavia, and the grim terror against the Albanians in Kosova  include ingredients that could lead to this war spreading. This  would be fatal to the peoples of the Balkans. We therefore  support every effort, within our beyond the Balkans, to avert  this.    In this tense situation in the region, the PSSh repeats its  stand in support of our brothers in Kosova, in their own  territories in the former Yugoslavia, and in the Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia. We clearly hold fast to the idea that  respect for the principle of that borders cannot be changed by  force does not conflict with the recognition of the rights of  people to self-determination. The PSSh thinks that there is an  urgent need today to find new ways for the peoples of the  Balkans to live together in peace and to work for prosperity and  democracy, not allowing antagonisms to be created among them  through the exploitation of differences in economic levels, or  national, religious, linguistic, and cultural differences, etc.  We think that an independent Kosova free from Serbian  occupation would not only realize aspirations of the people of  Kosova and be an important step toward solving our national  question, but would also be a factor of peace and stability in  the region.    Despite the serious conditions now prevailing in the  Balkans,  the PSSh repeats its familiar stand that Albanian diplomacy  should take realistic and tangible steps with clear initiatives  to reactivate bilateral and multilateral Balkan cooperation in  political, economic, and cultural fields, in technical and  academic cooperation, etc. The PSSh powerfully supports and  will devote all its energies to encouraging dialogue, mutual  understanding, and cooperation among the peoples of the region,  in the belief that interdependency and peaceful coexistence  constitute a contemporary framework for guaranteeing national  independence and identity. The problems of the Balkans must be  solved first of all by the peoples of the Balkan themselves, but  must of course be viewed in close connection with European and  world problems. Among other things, we favor acting on the  initiative for all the progressive left-wing forces in the  Balkans to sit down together "round one table."    At the same time, the PSSh declares itself against the  creation of miniature alliances and the spirit of speculation  and distrust that these create. Good bilateral relations should  pave the way for the establishment of broad, multilateral  cooperation in the region.    In this context, the PSSh long ago expressed its stand that  relations with such neighboring countries as Greece and Italy  must take priority in the region. We have always considered  these countries as natural gateways for Albania's integration in  Europe. However, unfortunately, a kind of undesirable chill has  arisen in our relations with them. Diplomatic efforts in this  field have been haphazard and dilettante.    We therefore wish that the Albanian state would undertake a  clear strategy in relation to our neighbor Greece, especially  now that there is a Socialist government there and we are  familiar with the predisposition and readiness of Pasok  [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] to normalize relations, to  achieve cooperation and good- neighborliness, and to legalize  Albanian emigrants working in Greece. We support the readiness  of Greek diplomacy to view more realistically both the concept  of Europe and the Cam problem.    We have been and will remain committed in our efforts and  stands on respecting and defending all the rights of the Greek  minority in Albania, recognized by the CSCE documents.    The PSSh appreciates Greece's assumption in her turn of the  EU chairmanship, and believes that she will play a significant  role in Albania's integration in civilized Europe. The Albanian  state, too, must be more active in this.    The Albanian people are grateful to friendly Italy for the  help that it has given and for its generosity in welcoming  thousands of young Albanian men and women. However, we cannot  agree with the Albanian Government's hasty and unargued  standpoints toward Italy, which recently, in the absence of  efforts to find a common language, have led to a cooling  relations between our two countries, something that is  unacceptable for the friendly feelings the Albanian people  cherish for the Italian people.    We appreciate the need to strengthen relations with Turkey,  for these are traditional relations with a friendly people that  supported Albania with their own generous help at the start of  democratic processes in the country. We similarly appreciate  the need to make more tangible relations with Bulgaria, Romania,  Croatia, and Slovenia, as Balkan countries.    We have desired and still desire good relations with the  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, not only because we wish  to see this country a factor of peace and stability in the  region, but also because more than 800,000 Albanians live there.  However, we have noticed some attitudes on the part of the  Macedonian state that are not in the least realistic toward the  fair demands of the Albanian population to enjoy the same rights  and freedoms enjoyed by citizens of other nationalities. We  cannot in any way agree with the statements of the highest  officials of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,  rejecting the Albanians as a state-forming element. In this  direction, the PSSh has criticized the tolerant and often  irresponsible attitudes of the Albanian Government, which has  both been in a hurry when there was no need, and has kept silent  when it should not have done.    We do not consider Albania's opening to the world to be  complete solely with stable and friendly relations with the  Balkan countries, Germany, France, Britain, the Scandinavian  countries, etc., and with the United States, but also with  Japan, China, Canada, the Russian Federation, the Arab  countries, etc. The government's occasional welcome steps in  this direction have either been inconsiderable or spectacular,  without any clear strategy, and without vigor.    We do not see Albania's inclination toward Europe as the  sole  direction of our foreign policy. In this context, we Socialists  have always appreciated relations with the United States. We  have valued the standards of U.S. democracy and U.S. technical  and professional assistance, which we would like to see grow and  expand.    We repeat the belief that any role and any step in foreign  policy is acceptable as long as it develops the concept of the  independence, sovereignty, integrity, and freedom of the  homeland, under conditions of interdependency. We favor the  dignified integration of Albania in Europe and in all its  political, economic, and military organisms. In this sense, we  value and appreciate cooperation with NATO, especially within  the framework of the Partnership for Peace initiated by U.S.  President Clinton.    We see this as an important step toward more solid forms of  integration in European processes and Euro-Atlantic security,  which will also lead to commitments for our country to respect  the principles of democracy and human rights and freedoms, an  area in which we are still far from familiar international  standards.    The PSSh thinks that to express a wish at a verbal level, as  did the parliament, is not enough to join Partnership for Peace  at the highest levels, because deserving and acquiring  partnership with NATO will, as we know, require proposals,  measures, and tangible commitments to be studied, coordinated,  and supported by legislation. For these, in our view, the  parliament must neither be left to one side or presented with a  "fait accompli," making what it has to say a mere formality, as  happens.    Comrades delegates, the PSSH is a force of the European  left,  committed to recognizing the traditions and characteristics of  European social democracy, which has now created its own social-  democratic profile. Its prestige is continually rising among  the circle of the socialist and social-democratic parties of  Europe. Since the party's First Congress in June 1992, it has  not only consolidated its relations with its sister parties, but  has further expanded them with the Spanish Socialist Party, the  Democratic Party of the Left in Italy, and the social-democratic  parties of the Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium, etc. Positive  steps have also been taken in relations with the German Social  Democratic Party. It is our task to promoted and consolidate  these.    We appreciate the interest being shown and the help recently  given to our party by the Socialist International Committee for  Central and East Europe as an important step toward the PSSh's  gradual integration in the Socialist International. While this  is one of our objectives for the future, we repeat that we have  never acted with the idea of affirming ourselves first abroad  and then in Albania. We therefore see our integration in the  Socialist International first of all as an ongoing duty toward  democracy in Albania.    The new political, economic, and social settlement that we  propose is the most tangible expression of this commitment to  the democracy, social peace, and economic reform that Albania  needs so badly. We are aware of the responsibilities and  sacrifices required from us, and we therefore declare once again  from the platform of this conference our readiness and  dedication, and that of all the PSSh's many members and  supporters.    Long live the PSSh! Long live the Albanian people!</p>

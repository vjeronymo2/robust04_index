			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Promise of boost in overseas aid MR Michael Meacher, shadow minister for overseas development, told delegates that a Labour government would increase overseas aid to meet the UN target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product. It would also implement the terms of the Trinidad agreement by relieving two thirds of the debt of the poorest and most severely indebted countries. Mr Meacher said Britain's relationship with under-developed countries under a Labour government would be based on partnership and not on self-interest or on patronising post-colonialism.</p>

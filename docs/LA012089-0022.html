			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> RUSH IS NAMED VICE PRESIDENT OF NEW CAL STATE SAN MARCOS  </P> <P> Richard Rush, who has been dean of San Diego State University's North County  Center in San Marcos, has been named vice president of the new Cal State San  Marcos and will take responsibility for the new campus until a president is  selected.  </P> <P> Rush's appointment was announced by W. Ann Reynolds, chancellor of the  California State University system.  </P> <P> "His expertise will be invaluable in coordinating the transition to a  full-service campus," Reynolds said. "There are literally thousands of details  involved in creating a new campus, and it is imperative that an able  administrator be on the scene to oversee those details. Dr. Rush's familiarity  with the site and with the operations of the North County Center will be a  great asset."  </P> <P> A new president for Cal State San Marcos is expected to be named this summer,  and will assume responsibility for the campus by September. The university is  expected to open to upper-division students in the fall of 1992, and to  freshmen and sophomores in 1995.  </P></p>

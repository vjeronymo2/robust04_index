"The  government has received the response of the Freedom Alliance to  the proposals of the South African Government/ANC [African  National Congress] of 21 December 1993," a statement by Deputy  Constitutional Development Minister Fanus Schoeman said on  Wednesday.    He added the government aimed to arrange talks between  itself, the African National Congress and the Freedom Alliance  early next week to discuss the response of the FA.    The Freedom Alliance on Tuesday responded to the December 21  government/ANC proposal by stating the FA had already committed  itself to an all-inclusive agreement through peaceful  negotiations if its amendments to the constitution were included  in a minimum package. The FA said its constitutional proposals  included provisions for self-determination of peoples on a  territorial basis; the powers, functions and financial affairs  of provinces; and separate ballot papers for elections for  different levels of government.</p>

			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Tough Italian package impresses currency markets FINANCIAL markets yesterday reacted positively, if cautiously, to the Italian government's emergency austerity budget announced late on Friday. The lira improved only slightly against the D-Mark, being quoted at L757.2 against Friday's L757.4. However, it recovered more ground against the other main European currencies. Dealers said they would have liked more concrete moves to cut public spending but were impressed by the fact that the measures were coherent and non-inflationary (inflation is running at an annualised 5.7 per cent) and had been put together quickly by Italian standards, in less than a week. The speed and decisiveness with which Mr Giuliano Amato's government has acted seems to have caught Italians by surprise even though they had been aware tough measures were essential to curb the public sector deficit. The Socialist prime minister has also tried to head off union protest by presenting a socially equitable package. Even so, the net effect of new duties and taxes on property and bank deposits will mean an average increase of L120,000 (Pounds 55) per month in tax for each household. The package has sought to find an extra L30,000bn to hold down the public sector deficit to L128,000bn as planned in the original 1992 budget. This will be split more or less equally between cuts and increased revenues. On revenue, the government has opted for measures which are easy to effect and which tax identifiable assets. Thus L11,200bn is expected to come from the unprecedented and one-off tax of 6 per 1,000 lire on bank deposits and Post Office savings. The remainder will come in increased property taxes, higher stamp duties and such measures as raising annual gun permit prices (from L200,000 to L400,000) for Italy's 8m hunters, passports and driving licences (renewed annually). On spending cuts, more than L1,700bn will come from the defence budget. Other savings will come in freezes in public sector employment, lower transfers to local authorities and reduced calls on social spending via increased employee contributions. Pension reform, gradually raising the retirement age to 65 for men and women through incentives, announced as part of the budget, is likely to have only limited impact this year. The government will also save money by the removal, effective this week, of guarantees on foreign exchange risk on all public (and some private) foreign loans. The main uncertainty involves the extent to which privatisation plans can be accelerated to generate income within 1992. As of yesterday IRI, the main state holding company, ENI, the state oil concern, ENEL, the state electricity authority, and INA, the insurance institute, formally became joint stock companies under the tutelage of the treasury as a prelude to privatising up to 45 per cent of their shares. The government hopes to raise L4,000bn through privatisation by year-end but this may have to come via an advance from a consortium of banks formed to guarantee the share issues. Before the measures, the public sector deficit was already set to rise to L175,000bn, nearly 11 per cent of GDP. Even if the budget succeeds, it would be surprising if the deficit can be held down to L128,000bn. Also, many of the measures used to generate extra revenue are one-off. To retain credibility, they will have to be part of larger structural reforms attacking the overblown public sector and tax evasion.</p>

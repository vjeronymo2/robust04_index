			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / International Company News: Australian coal producer's profits up 23% COAL and Allied Industries, the Australian coal producer, has increased net profits for the year to June by 23 per cent to ADollars 59.7m (USDollars 40.4m). The result was achieved on a 7 per cent improvement in revenue to ADollars 657.4m. The company is stepping up its dividend from 60 cents to 70 cents a share. Coal production rose marginally from 11m to 11.1m tonnes, but sales rose strongly from 11.1m to 11.9m tonnes. Reviews of the underground operations led to significant reductions in employee numbers during the year. The board is making a provision of ADollars 35.1m before tax for diminution in the value of the assets. That provision led to a net ADollars 28.4m abnormal loss but this was offset by a ADollars 7.5m tax credit. Depreciation took ADollars 51.5m, against ADollars 44.4m.</p>

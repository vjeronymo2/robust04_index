			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Self-rule supported 'by 31% of Scots' FEWER THAN a third of Scottish voters support independence, according to a Market Research Scotland poll in today's Scottish Daily Express. This contrasts with a survey a week ago indicating that half of Scottish voters wanted independence. The latest poll shows 34 per cent supporting some form of devolution, 31 per cent supporting outright independence, and 25 per cent favouring remaining part of the United Kingdom, with 10 per cent 'don't knows'. Party preferences where: Labour 41 per cent, Scottish National Party 29 per cent, Conservatives 21 per cent, Liberal Democrat 8 per cent, and others 1 per cent. The poll was conducted among 1,020 respondents between January 31 and February 3. Mrt Alex Salmond, Scottish National Party leader, said: 'We have more than doubled our support since the last election.' Mr John Major, the prime minister, is expected to visit Scotland within the next few weeks as Conservatives try to rally voters behind the government's opposition to a devolved Scottish assembly. Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, said he thought it was impossible to set up an assembly which would not lead to the end of Scotland's union with England and Wales. Speaking on BBC Television Mr Lang also ruled out a referendum on Scotland's future.</p>

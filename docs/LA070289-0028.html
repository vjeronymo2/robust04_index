			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NASTY NEWS ON AWARDS  </P> <P> Mean-spirited is the way to describe the advertising "awards" handed out by the  Center for Science in the Public Interest ("Deceit Brings Dishonor to the Worst  Ads of '88," June 13.) The center claims to be a public interest organization.  Who asked them to represent the public?  </P> <P> Most people never heard of the Center for Science in the Public Interest until  their nasty "awards" hit the news. The center is actually a special-interest  organization whose main purpose seems to be to collect money to attack private  enterprise.  </P> <P> American business is in a race for its life in a keenly competitive global  market. Its success or failure will affect our jobs, our life styles and our  children's futures. Constructive criticism can be useful but to single out the  "worst" and hold those ads up to public mockery while ignoring some of the  better ads is not in the public interest.  </P> <P> M.

			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Crimea in time with Moscow Ukraine's Crimea peninsula is marking this weekend's elections for Ukraine's first post-independence parliament by moving its clocks an hour ahead: to Moscow time. It will also be holding an opinion poll, banned by President Leonid Kravchuk last week as a referendum in disguise, asking citizens if they want dual-citizenship with Russia, equal status with Kiev and enhanced decree powers for the region's president. Crimea is one of three Ukrainian regions holding outlawed plebiscites this weekend. Donetsk and Lugansk, in eastern Ukraine, will also be asking their citizens if they support regional autonomy and making Russian an official language. The polls will have immediate results and pose immediate problems for Kiev, since they could arm all three regions with a popular mandate to seek independence from Ukraine. The outcome of the Ukrainian parliamentary election is likely to be far less clear and far less immediate. Election rules require the winner to poll at least 51 per cent in each district, but with as many as 25 candidates in some districts, most races will go to a second round of voting on April 10 and results will not be known until mid-April.</p>

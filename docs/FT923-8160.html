			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Arts: Richard III - Theatre/Stratford-upon-Avon THE longest-lived version of Richard III stayed unchallenged from 1700 until the 1820s; it was written by Colley Cibber, who acted it from 1700 to 1739. His Richard was a man of moral depravity and excellent wit, like the Restoration fops (Lord Foppington, Sir Novelty Fashion) Cibber habitually played. Now another actor has followed Cibber's example in Sam Mendes' excellent touring production of Richard III at The Other Place. Simon Russell Beale, an accomplished foppiste, has fashioned a strange, dangerous Richard: all irony and spite, redeemed by a scarifying wit. It is a wonderful portrayal and a fine, intelligent performance. Beale hobbles noisily on to a dark silent stage; a bare lightbulb glows. Already controlling the audience, Beale begins to speak the familiar opening; he hates the words, the verse is barbed, impatient with civility, sneering. Careless of others' welfare and intent on his own, Beale's Richard has edge and depth. Overall, the performance matches Beale's standards. The set (by Tim Hatley) combines simplicity and versatility, as befits a touring production. A bare dais fronts a grey wall punctuated by doors. Through the openings, livid hangings of red and blue appear. The lighting (Paul Pyant) is monochrome and the costumes plain black and white. This is a lesson in economy and style, even if the props (strawberries, place markers for Council meetings, bowler hats for the Mayor and Londoners) threaten the clean lines. A floor map of Britain unrolls for the plotting scenes before battle, a reminder that Richard and Richmond fought over the country's future. Everywhere the production shows Mendes' acuity in finding a dramatic reason for each line. Margaret's cursing of the court, intoned from a chalk circle, makes an awkward scene powerful; it also provides a central motif, for she repeats her curse at the demise of Rivers, Grey, Hastings and Buckingham. Richard dies as he sees her walking across Bosworth Field. At Bosworth, the ghosts of Richard's victims join him at table before the battle. His awakening after this dream - a waking which made David Garrick famous in the part (1741-76) - is beautifully controlled: quiet and honest. Shaw rightly called Richmond's address to his army 'pious twaddle' compared to Richard's gutsy 'To't pell mell, If not to heaven, then hand in hand to hell.' Here, Mendes intercuts the two, making an exciting, pacy scene of the original staid oratory. The cast has strength enough to allow Beale's occasional indulgences: barking dogs, pace Shakespeare, herald his entrances. Queen Elizabeth (Kate Duchene) and the deep revolving witty Buckingham (Stephen Boxer) are the foils to Richard, the one careful and resigned, the other bold then scared. Mark Benton and Christopher Hunter make fine unwilling murderers of Clarence. The production tours England before arriving for the new year in London, 400 years after Shakespeare wrote it.

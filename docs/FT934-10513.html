			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Ferruzzi heirs in suit for damages THE DRAMA of Italy's Ferruzzi family, once among Europe's wealthiest clans and now diminished by the collapse of the multinational group it once controlled, shows no sign of abating. Three of the four heirs of Mr Serafino Ferruzzi, the group's founder, have launched one of Italy's biggest claims for damages. The legal action is against Mrs Idina Gardini (nee Ferruzzi), the wife of the entrepreneur Mr Raul Gardini, who guided Ferruzzi for much of the time after Mr Ferruzzi's death in 1979. Mr Gardini, who shot himself earlier this year after becoming embroiled in Italy's political corruption scandal, gave up control of Ferruzzi in July 1991 following a family rift. Mrs Gardini received L505bn (Pounds 206m) from her relatives for her 23 per cent stake in the family holding company, which controls the quoted Ferruzzi group, and the two families parted company. In the suit, launched in the Ferruzzi's home town of Ravenna, Mrs Gardini's relatives are reclaiming the L505bn, plus interest, along with a further L1,600bn in damages to cover the alleged 'nullification' of their stake in Ferruzzi caused by Mr Gardini's alleged mismanage-ment. The group, which has borrowings of more than L28,000bn, has been effect-ively controlled by a pool of creditor banks since reporting financial difficulties in May.</p>

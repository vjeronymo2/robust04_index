At a Wednesday meeting with  the press he said that everywhere peace-keepers are subordinate  directly to the national Armed Forces.    He stressed that the new ministry does not have any combat  weapons at its disposal. "Even when it carries out its missions  it rents ships, aviation and armored vehicles from the Armed  Forces and pays for their use", he said.    In Grachev's opinion the Ministry for Emergencies has no  experience in commanding peace-keeping forces. He said that the  purpose of the ministry is to resolve domestic problems: deal  with the consequences of air crashes, accidents on railways or  power stations etc.    "Peace-keeping tasks lie beyond the territory of the Russian  Federation", he stressed.    At a news conference on March 17 the Minister for  Emergencies  Sergey Shoygu spoke in favor of subordinating the Russian  peace-keeping force to his ministry.    Defense Minister Pavel Grachev expressed the opinion that  the  Federal Assembly will pass a law on the peace-keeping force  after the April 20th. He told journalists that the status of  units of the Russian Armed Forces performing peace-keeping  functions has not been defined yet.    Answering a question from Interfax Grachev expressed the  hope  that the defense budget would be increased in 1994. He stressed  that legislators are also responsible for the security of the  state. According to Grachev, the budget proposed by the cabinet  will not allow his ministry to continue reforming the Army. He  said the money will not be enough to purchase the necessary  weapons and machinery.    "With such a budget I will not be able to build strong Armed  Forces," Pavel Grachev said.</p>

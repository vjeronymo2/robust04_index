			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Bureau of Labor Statistics. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Bureau of Labor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Statistics (BLS) publishes annual reports that list the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimates of injuries in the private sector during the year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under consideration, Occupational Injuries and Illnesses in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the United States by Industry (Ex. 2&hyph;1, 2&hyph;2, 2&hyph;3, 2&hyph;4, 2&hyph;5,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2&hyph;6, 2&hyph;7, 2&hyph;8, 2&hyph;9, 2&hyph;10, 2&hyph;30, 38B and 38C). The data and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information are broken down industry by industry according  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes. The BLS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> injury reports and data are generated from inquiries to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> selected employers about the OSHA Form 200 (Log and Summary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Table 1 shows BLS occupational injury incidence data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the logging industry for 1972 through 1991. The data in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Table 1 were derived from the BLS data using SIC code 241  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Logging Camps and Logging Contractors). While this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classification covers the majority of the employees engaging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in logging operations, it does not cover loggers employed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mills (SIC 242&hyph;Sawmills and Planing Mills) and other loggers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> working for other miscellaneous employers (SIC 24&hyph;Lumber and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Wood Products, Except Furniture). Although the incidence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates for SIC 242 and 24 are very close to the rates for SIC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 241, OSHA did not include incidence rates for those SIC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> codes in its determination of incidence rates for logging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because BLS does not provide incidence rates for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupational categories within a SIC code. As such, OSHA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was not able to identify and segregate out the percentage of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accidents which occurred while employees were performing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> logging as opposed to other operations in those related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industries. OSHA is aware that there has been a move on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part of some mill owners to increasingly use private  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contractors rather than mill employees to harvest the trees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the mills process. OSHA believes, however, that SIC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 241 does capture the vast majority of employees performing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> logging operations. To the extent that some logging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations may still be performed by employees in other than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SIC 241, OSHA does not believe that their accident data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significantly alter the level of risk present in logging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

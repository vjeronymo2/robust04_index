			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / International Company News: Paribas in black but makes heavy provisions PARIBAS, the leading French investment bank, returned to the black last year with a net profit of FFr900m (Dollars 167.9m), but was forced to make heavy provisions because of the problems of the property market and small businesses in France. The group, which fell into a loss in 1991 for the first time in its history, managed to maintain operating income at FFr9bn during the year thanks to its cost-cutting programme. The board decided to hold the dividend at FFr12 a share. Paribas' return to profit was clouded by last autumn's scandal over the discovery of off-balance sheet losses at Ciments Francais, the French cement company in which it is a sizeable shareholder. The bank's share of Ciments Francais' losses amounted to FFr400m in the first half of 1992. It is awaiting the publication of the cement company's results to discover the full extent of its second-half losses. In the meantime, Paribas has had to pay back FFr500m of the money received last spring from the sale of a controlling stake in Ciments Francais to Italcementi of Italy. This has left Paribas with a FFr500m profit on the deal, without taking into account its share of Ciments Francais' 1992 losses. In spite of the Ciments Francais debacle, Paribas made an overall profit of FFr2.8bn on disposals last year which included the sale of stakes in Matra Communication and Lapeyre. This profit helped to mitigate the effect of another year of hefty write-downs. Paribas was forced to make provisions of FFr7.8bn in 1992, slightly lower than FFr9.5bn in 1991, mainly on its Compagnie Bancaire and Credit du Nord banking subsidiaries. It was also affected by the impact of the continuing UK recession.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. Grlickov] </F>   [Text] The reactions of bankers to the enactments in the  monetary and foreign exchange sphere can be briefly reduced to  the following: The enactments based on the Program for  Reconstruction of the Monetary System and Yugoslavia's Economic  Recovery are being supported, and the criticism is being  directed toward oversights and deficiencies in preparation of  the program's application.    Dragoljub Vukosavljevic, president of Union Bank, is  critical  of the poor preparation for practical implementation of the  program in view of the fact that all the enactments were not  adopted on time. He therefore poses the question whether the  bank will be able to prove the origin of foreign exchange and  foreign currencies when it purchases them for new convertible  dinars; that is, how much will be expected of it in relations  with the NBJ [National Bank of Yugoslavia]. If the objective is  to activate holdings of foreign exchange, foreign currencies,  and gold in banks and firms, one can guess the answer to the  question. Toma Nedeljkovic of the NBJ has said in this  connection that they will not be calling for the origin of  foreign exchange and currency, since a kind of legalization of  these reserves has already taken place through previous  commitments and enactments. A separate question is whether and  to what extent foreign exchange reserves tied to the issue of  the new dinars should be transferred to the NBJ, as it would be  better, according to Vitomir Janjuz, director of the Belgrade  Credit Bank, that they remain in the bank (with the convertible  dinar as an element of their security). One particular problem  might be a shortage of new dinars at the outset to cover the  foreign exchange and currency that the public is ready to offer  to the banks. That might suggest the conclusion that there will  be no dinars in cash even if foreign exchange and currencies are  offered to the NBJ.    There is some question about the foreign exchange reserves  in  the amount of $200 million envisaged as the basis of for issuing  the new dinars. The $200 million cannot be expected to service  the anticipated social product of $10 billion. To achieve that,  the money supply would have to have an extremely high rate of  turnover, one that is not possible anywhere in the world today,  says Milo Kaponja of Centrobanka, pointing out the problem of  the scant foreign exchange reserves.    The foreign exchange reserves are not sufficient to cover  the  lending operations of the banks, and it is not good to create  the impression that they have excessive holdings. Those holdings  are mostly committed already in industry or are in accounts  abroad. In any case, the reserves would be quickly spent, and  unless there are essential changes in the structure of the  state, the economy and banking, the program will soon come to an  end. Milomir Spasic, general manager of Slavija Bank, believes  that it will all come down to expenditure of the foreign  exchange reserves unless there are changes and support within  industry. The chances of that happening are slim at present.    As to supplying the foreign exchange reserves to carry out  the program, the bankers support the idea of turning old foreign  exchange savings into public debt of the state, covered by a  three-year moratorium. they suggest in this connection that  minimum payouts of savings nevertheless be made to the poorest  segments of the population. At the same time, it would be good  to establish the real balance of that debt, since it could  differ from what has been recorded as foreign exchange savings  deposited in the National Bank of Yugoslavia.    It is seen as a good sign that the program contains a break  with social ownership and a pity that it was not accompanied by  adoption of an enactment to that effect. It would perhaps be  good in this connection for property in the form of goods and  real estate to be used more as collateral to cover bank loans  (mortgages and secured loans), which can in turn be taken as  criticism of the policy of linking primary note issue  exclusively to coverage consisting of foreign exchange,  currencies and gold.    The entire program, says Ratko Djuric of Agrobanka, is based  on reform of the monetary and fiscal systems and essentially  represents an effort to consolidate budget deficits. Nothing is  said in the program about primary distribution, prices,  disparities, and the like, which was added (with or without the  knowledge of the program's authors) to the enactments.    The main problem with the program and the enactments is that  they do not furnish sufficient foreign exchange reserves to  carry it out. Toma Nedeljkovic of the NBJ remains an optimist  concerning this question from the bankers, hoping that support  for the program will nevertheless come from the IMF. The program  does contain elements the IMF poses as a condition for  furnishing countries support. But that is still a long way from  specific support, and without that there is no chance of lasting  success and recovery. Of course any departures from vital  commitments in the program, such as those related to the budget  deficit, and especially the fact that its expenditures have not  been reduced this time either, could raise the question of how  long it will last.</p>

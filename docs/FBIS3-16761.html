			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kirill Ignatyev, member of the Russia's Choice  parliamentary group coordinating committee and member of the  parliamentary information committee, described the setting up of  an Accord in the Name of Russia movement as the emergence of  "Rutskoy's small party." Rutskoy is likely to run in the next  presidential race.    Ignatyev told Interfax that it was significant that the  appeal to Russia's citizens which declared the setting up of the  movement had not been signed by the Liberal Democratic Party  whose leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy will "beyond any doubt" run  for presidency.    Ignatyev took note of the fact that the appeal had not been  signed by opposition figures such as Viktor Anpilov and Viktor  Tyulkin, the leader of the Russian Communist Party, a rival of  the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, headed by Gennady  Zyuganov, who did join the Accord in the Name of Russia.    Ignatyev thought that the setting up of a new movement  reflected a deep split among counter-reformists and the tendency  to build up various groups around presidential candidates.    He admitted, however, that "even though just a small number  of counter-reformists rallied around the Accord, we must  understand that the setting up of the so-called Rutskoy's party  compels the democrats to consolidate." Russia's Choice would  step up work on the setting up of its own party, he said.</p>

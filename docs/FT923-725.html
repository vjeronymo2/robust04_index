			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Losses deepen at Clayform Properties Trading in both its business sectors, property and shoe retailing, continued to be 'disappointing' for Clayform Properties, where the pre-tax loss for the six months to June 30 increased from Pounds 6.6m to Pounds 10.9m. In addition to realised losses of Pounds 700,000 on its development portfolio, Mr Michael Wigley, the chairman, said that further provisions of Pounds 3.2m had been made to reflect current values. Lack of consumer spending resulted in a greater than budgeted operating loss of Pounds 3.5m (Pounds 2.7m) at Stead &amp; Simpson. Group operating losses were Pounds 3.9m (Pounds 1.1m profits). Losses per share worked through at 31.3p (7.5p).</p>

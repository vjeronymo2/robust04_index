			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Italy cuts interest rates The Bank of Italy yesterday cut its official discount rate by 0.5 percentage point to 10.5 per cent at the end of a week which has seen continued weakness for the D-Mark against European currencies, writes James Blitz. Announcing the move, the Italian central bank said it would take effect from Monday and that its Lombard rate would also come down 50 basis points to 11 per cent. The move is the latest indication that European countries are not waiting for the Bundesbank to reduce interest rates before deciding to ease their own monetary policies.</p>

			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Counting cost of burgers for bankers: Big Macs enter calculation of pay scales at UBS The economic research department of one of the world's leading banks has settled upon the McDonald's Big Mac hamburger as an international measure to quantify the purchasing power of wages. Union Bank of Switzerland has included a Big Mac scale in its new edition of Prices and Earnings around the Globe, a survey of international prices and wages. The UBS researchers say the best way to illustrate the purchasing power of wages is to set them in relation to the prices of individual products. The most suitable measures, they have found, is a 1kg loaf of bread and a Big Mac. According to the UBS statistics, the worst place to be if you are penniless and in need of a hamburger is Lagos, the Nigerian capital. There it will take you more than 11 hours of toil, almost two full workdays, to earn enough to buy one, compared with 14 minutes in Chicago at the other end of the scale. International price comparisons and cost of living indicators are becoming increasingly valuable to executives negotiating pay packages for overseas postings. The UBS survey uses a uniform basket of goods so that clear comparisons can be made. The survey shows that while the top earnings are in Switzerland, the most expensive apartments are in Hong Kong and the dearest clothes in Tokyo. Household appliances are cheapest in the US. North America also has the least expensive motoring, while those using public transport in Europe can expect to pay through the nose. Among the smaller items, a shampoo and set at a women's hairdresser costs between Dollars 40 and Dollars 65 (Pounds 42) in Oslo. The best places for a cheap hairdo - less than Dollars 7 - are Taipei, Caracas, Budapest, Nairobi, Prague and Bombay. The biggest gross earners are the Swiss, the Danes and the Japanese, followed by the Germans, Luxembourg and the US. London is midway in the earnings league behind Milan and Paris, with Nairobi, Lagos and Bombay at the foot of the table. Luxembourg incomes, however, enjoy the most purchasing power, followed by those in Toronto, Montreal and Dusseldorf. People in the Far East tend to work the longest hours, while the least hours are worked by those in Madrid. Of the 53 cities in the comparison, Tokyo is the most expensive, with Lagos surprisingly in second place, followed by Oslo and Zurich. If you are thinking about a romantic weekend away, the cost of spending a night for two in a double room with a bathroom in a first-class hotel ranges from Dollars 112 in Nairobi to Dollars 382 in Tokyo. A regional breakdown, however, shows that North America offers the best overnight deals, at an average of Dollars 185 for two. A night in London on those terms will set you back Dollars 375. The southern hemisphere also seems to be the best place to go for a candlelight dinner. An evening meal of sirloin steak or rib of beef with two side dishes and dessert, no drink, costs Dollars 76 in Singapore and Dollars 72 in Tokyo, whereas the same quality fare can be had for Dollars 8 in Nairobi. Lisbon, Helsinki and Athens are the cheapest cities for dining in western Europe, where prices are about average on the whole. Totting everything up, including a night in a hotel, two evening meals with a bottle of house red wine, a taxi ride in the city centre, car rental for half a day, cinema tickets for two, a couple of Big Macs and two bus rides, the most expensive city for a flying visit is Tokyo at Dollars 740, with Zurich, Geneva and London following at Dollars 600 each. The cheapest place for a quick visit is Nairobi at Dollars 200, followed by Kuala Lumpur at Dollars 240, Tel Aviv at Dollars 250, then Bombay and Caracas, each at Dollars 260.

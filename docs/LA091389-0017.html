			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: SMALL FITS IN WITH REST OF TERRIFIC 22 AREA PLAYERS  </P> <P> To some, the inclusion of senior Errol Small among the top 22 players in the  Southland in a recent poll of college recruiting services seemed odd.  </P> <P> The Notre Dame High tailback rushed for 471 yards in 84 carries during his  junior year. Three backs in the Valley gained more than three times as many  yards last season. Small's yardage -- most of which came against Division VII  opponents -- didn't even place him among the top 20 Valley-area running backs.  This was one of the Terrific 22?  </P> <P> Small posted a resounding rebuttal Friday at Alemany, scoring on runs of 57,  seven, and 89 yards and intercepting two passes. He also ran 75 yards for an  apparent score in the second quarter, but the play was nullified by a holding  penalty. In all, he gained 213 yards in 14 carries -- a 15.2-yard average.  </P> <P> "I've never seen one individual have such a great game on both sides of the  ball," Notre Dame Coach Kevin Rooney said.  </P> <P> The Alemany defense was not baffled by the Knights' offensive strategy -- 14 of  Notre Dame's 32 plays were runs by Small.  </P> <P> "We had guys at the point of attack but we didn't tackle well at all," Alemany  Coach Pat Blackburn said. "You've got to take him on and wrap him up. A lot of  our guys were diving at him and if you do that, he's going to run right through  you.  </P> <P> "Those guys at running back are about five dollars a dozen instead of a dime.  They're a rare commodity. It isn't too often you find a back like that."  </P> <P> Small likes to think of himself as more bash than flash. He uses his 6-foot-3,  205-pound frame to steamroller defenders.  </P> <P> "I've learned to deliver the blow instead of take it," he said. "I'm using my  defensive mentality on offense. Before coming up to the tackle I used to slow  down and cover up. Now, I'm just full speed ahead and take what they give me.  Try and make some room. Go through someone."  </P> <P> Teammates nicknamed Small "E-rock" because taking a shot from him is tantamount  to smacking into a granite slab at full tilt. Alemany sophomore Brian Brison  experienced the sensation Friday night. After catching a six-yard pass over the  middle, Brison found himself between E-rock and a hard place and was leveled.  </P> <P> Said Notre Dame tackle John DiSante of the hit: "Looking at Brison was like,  'Hey, this is varsity.' Errol pretty much told him, 'This is my house. This is  Notre Dame defense. This is the way we hit and you better get used to it  tonight.' "  </P> <P> Small's offensive hit parade began on his fifth carry. After opening with gains  of two, three, five and eight yards, he took a pitch from quarterback Greg  Andrachick at the Notre Dame 43-yard line with 4:05 to play in the first  quarter and darted untouched up the right sideline for a score.  </P> <P> With his team leading, 14-0, midway through the second quarter, Andrachick  found Guillermo Eguez on a 40-yard pass down the middle to put the Knights at  the Alemany seven. On the following play, Small juked his way into the end  zone.  </P> <P> Alemany answered with a six-play, 45-yard drive that Small squelched from his  strong-safety position when he made a diving interception.  </P> <P> On Notre Dame's second possession of the third quarter, Small made his only  blunder of the game, fumbling the ball away.  </P> <P> With 7:31 to play and Notre Dame at its 11, Small took a handoff and broke  several tackles at the line of scrimmage. Maintaining his footing, he stumbled  through the secondary, regained his balance and raced 89 yards for the game's  final touchdown.  </P> <P> Alemany made its last extended drive of the game -- a seven-play march to the  Notre Dame 22 that ended when Small picked off a pass in the end zone.  </P> <P> Small, who was named player of the week by the San Fernando Valley chapter of  the National Football Foundation, hopes to attend USC and eventually study  psychiatry.  </P> <P> "I've always thought about that career as a kid," he said. "I just like to see  what makes people run."  </P> <P> For Small, all it takes is a football.  </P></p>

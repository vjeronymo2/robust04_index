			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Flotation set to put Pounds 200m tag on MIN Midland Independent Newspapers, the regional publisher, is likely have a market value of close to Pounds 200m when it comes to market next month. Analysts were yesterday speculating that it would float on a prospective multiple of about 21-22 times. MIN has been compared with Trinity International and Johnston Press, both of which have multiples of about 24.5. Last year, MIN made operating profits of Pounds 15.7m (Pounds 13.4m) on sales of Pounds 79.6m (Pounds 66.6m). The group was bullish about its prospects yesterday as it published the pathfinder prospectus ahead of the float which will reduce the debt incurred in the management buy-out in 1991. It said classified recruitment advertising, the highest yielding category, had risen by 20 per cent, year on year, in the second half of 1993. Costs had been cut by Pounds 4.5m, while operating margins jumped from 8.9 per cent in 1991 to 21.4 per cent in 1993. The prospectus highlighted the litigation launched earlier this week against Mr David Sullivan, owner of Birmingham City Football Club, and Ms Karren Brady, its managing director. The two are being sued for libel in connection with the distribution of an anonymous letter making certain allegations regarding the group, its titles and the listing. Ms Brady said she had met with MIN executives this week and both parties had agreed 'this has gone too far. We hope to have a meeting soon'.</p>

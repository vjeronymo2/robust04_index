There are at least two grounds for these concerns. The first  is the socio-economic situation in the regions, leading electors  not to vote for well-considered policies. The second is the  democrats' lack of unity.    The meeting heard the opinion that electoral legislation  needs fine-tuning, in particular to provide for second rounds of  voting for candidates to local legislatures.    Filatov stressed that the president's supervisory agencies  will set up bodies to oversee discipline in executive  authorities in the regions. There will be one department of the  head of state's administration to work with public  organizations, with account taken of the forthcoming local  elections.</p>

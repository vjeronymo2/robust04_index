			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Business Travel (Update): Mahjong ban Taiwan's China Airlines (CAL), under pressure about safety after its worst crash, has banned its pilots from playing mahjong while abroad after they were criticised for living decadent lives, say airline officials. CAL has ordered all flight personnel not to play mahjong while travelling, Hsu Chia-yen, director of the flight operation division, was quoted as saying. Taiwan has launched an overall examination of its aviation security after a CAL Airbus A300-600R exploded and disintegrated as it tried to land at Japan's Nagoya Airport on April 26, killing 264 people.</p>

			<p><P> August 7, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> INCREASE FOUND IN HAND, WRIST DISORDER  </P> <P> The number of people suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome, a trauma disorder  caused by repetitive and stressful motions of the hand and wrist, may be far  higher than recognized, the results of a California study suggest. Carpal  tunnel syndrome is marked by pain and numbness in the hand and wrist. Evidence  of injury has been found among garment workers, butchers, grocery checkers,  assembly-line workers, typists and musicians, among others. But the Centers for  Disease Control reports that reliable information on the number of people  affected is lacking, in part because health professionals are not trained to  detect it.  </P> <P> This view is borne out by a survey undertaken last year by the California  Occupational Health Program in Santa Clara County and reported last month in  Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Of 515 health-care providers, 95%  reported caring for a total of 7,214 people suffering from carpal tunnel  syndrome. Of those, 3,413 cases were deemed work-related. This compares with  just 71 work-related cases reported to the state in 1986.  </P></p>

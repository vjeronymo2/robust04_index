Recalling that Comrade Kim Chong-il in this work indicated a  unique line of vigorously conducting economic propaganda and  agitation on the basis of a scientific analysis of the realistic  demand of socialist economic construction in our country and  precious practical experience, the author of the article says:    The great vitality of our party's policy of economic  propaganda and agitation lies, first of all, in that it has  brought home to the party members and working people our party's  chuche-based line of economic construction and economic policy  and guided them to thoroughly defend and implement them.    The work contains the idea of energetically conducting the  work of arming the party members and working masses with the  party's line of building an independent national economy and its  economic policy in each period.    The proud reality in which all people have turned out and  are  achieving new miracles and feats, upholding the revolutionary  economic strategy setpforth by our party, is a precious fruition  of the arming of the party members and working masses with the  party's line of economic construction and economic policy.    The great vitality of our party's economic propaganda and  agitation lies in that with the brisk progress of economic  agitation, the revolutionary zeal and the creative ingenuity of  the masses have been brought into full play in socialist  economic construction.    The dear leader in the work indicated concrete tasks arising  in vigorously conducting economic agitation on the basis of the  success and experience already attained. What is important here  is to concentrate economic agitation on the fulfilment of  economic tasks set forth by the party and the leader in each  time.    The great effect of economic agitation was demonstrated by  the completion of such difficult and gigantic project as the  West Sea barrage in a short time and construction of many  monumental edifices including the May Day Stadium in a brief  period.    With stress laid on enlisting the idea of people in economic  agitation, a change has taken place in the work of remoulding  their idea [word indistinct] construction.    Noting that the great vitality of our party's policy of  economic propaganda and agitation also lies in the successful  application of the anti-Japanese guerrilla-style propaganda and  agitation, the article says: This is a most revolutionary one  which makes it possible to stir the hearts of the masses by  conducting agitprop activities with mobility any time, without  formality and not restricted by place and condition.</p>

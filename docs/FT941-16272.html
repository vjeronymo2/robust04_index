			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / UK Company News: AG Barr declines by 32% to Pounds 4.1m in trade 'horror story' Profits at AG Barr, the Glasgow-based soft drinks company which manufactures Irn-Bru and Tizer, fell 32 per cent before tax in the 52 weeks to October 30. The decline to Pounds 4.07m (Pounds 5.97m) was struck on turnover down at Pounds 87.9m (Pounds 94.7m). The shares slipped 5p to 305p. Mr Robin Barr, chairman, said that trading in the year had been 'extremely disappointing'. He said that the summer had been 'one of the worst for many years' with sales in the first week of June down 44 per cent on last time. He also blamed the declines in profits and turnover on increases in sugar prices since the UK left the ERM - they were up 18 per cent in February, falling to 12 per cent in August - and a 'softening of prices' in the group's non-branded products. While a branded two litre bottle cost 99p, an own-label product has often been reduced from 59p to 45p, and the prices of commodity tertiary brands have fallen to as little as 26p for two litres. In addition, last time's figures were for 53 weeks and included an exceptional profit of Pounds 409,000 from the sale of the stake in Taveners, the sugar confectionery maker. However, Mr Barr said he was pleased with 'the way we moved within the trade, even if the trade itself was a horror story'. Sales of Barr's brands, which account for about 90 per cent of group turnover, rose 4 per cent, helped by increased marketing budgets for Irn-Bru and Tizer. In the other flavours segment of the UK carbonates market Irn-Bru lifted its market share from 7.9 to 9.2 per cent. The interest bill was sharply reduced to Pounds 591,000 (Pounds 1.07m) and Mr Barr expects that to fall further in the current year, in spite of anticipated capital expenditure costs of between Pounds 4.5m and Pounds 5m, against Pounds 4.1m in the period under review. The final dividend is held at 4.75p for an unchanged 6.5p total, payable from earnings down at 15.51p (21.57p) per share.</p>

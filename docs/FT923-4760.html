			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / International Company News: Strong performance lifts Amcor AMCOR, the Australian paper and packaging group, has defied recession in its main markets, registering a 29 per cent increase in consolidated net profit to ADollars 223m (USDollars 160.3m) in the year to end-June. Turnover rose 23 per cent to ADollars 4.1bn. The group also reported an abnormal net profit of ADollars 43m, reflecting an ADollars 80.5m profit on the sale of part of its stake in Mayne Nickless, the transport, security and health group, offset by restructuring costs. Amcor said profits had been lifted by a strong performance by its core paper and packaging activities in Australia, and the consolidation of Spicer's paper from January, when the group increased its stake from 19 per cent to 46 per cent. The board declared a final dividend of 15 cents a share, franked to 95 per cent. The interim dividend was 14 cents, franked to 64 per cent. The total of 29 cents compares with 27 cents in the previous year. Amcor said the 'excellent' result was achieved in spite of severe recession in Australia and its other main markets in New Zealand, Canada and Europe. Activities outside Australia accounted for 35 per cent of sales and 23 per cent of operating profits.</p>

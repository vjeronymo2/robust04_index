			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / BA chief and Branson to meet: Airline heads seek rapid end to conflict prompted by 'dirty tricks' affair SIR COLIN MARSHALL, British Airways' chief executive and deputy chairman, will meet Mr Richard Branson, the head of Virgin Atlantic, next week in a final attempt to end the conflict triggered by BA's 'dirty tricks' campaign. The meeting is expected to take place as early as Monday amid growing indications that both sides are anxious to improve relations which have continued to be strained despite BA's two public apologies and a Pounds 610,000 libel settlement. Virgin indicated last night it wanted the issue resolved by the middle of next week, although it still threatens to take further legal action against BA in the US courts. 'No one wants this affair to drag on,' the airline said last night. BA is also keen to settle the damaging affair without further delay. But the airline is uncertain over Virgin's likely demands, which could prove too much for BA to swallow. Mr Branson is expected to insist on cash compensation for lost revenue arising out of its rival's campaign as well as a legally binding agreement preventing any future abuse of Virgin's computer reservation information. Virgin also wants access to BA's maintenance facilities for its aircraft. Access was withdrawn five years ago. Sir Colin emphasised this week that he was anxious to establish better relations with Virgin, while Mr Branson has indicated he would like to avoid taking any further legal action. Although BA's executive management is continuing its investigation into its marketing, public affairs and legal departments in the aftermath of the 'dirty tricks' campaign, no sackings or resignations have so far emerged. In an effort to restore staff morale and publicly demonstrate its commitment to best business practice, BA yesterday published its new code of conduct for its 50,000 employees. 'The best way to put the past behind us is to make it plain how we intend to go forward in the future,' Sir Colin says in an introduction to the document. The code sets down general standards of behaviour covering issues ranging from 'fairness' and 'integrity' to 'honesty' and 'fair competition'. It urges employees: 'Be prepared to challenge if you believe others are acting in an unethical way . . .' However, BA's attempts to restore an air of normality remain under a cloud as institutional investors continue to express concern over the com-pany's failure to split the roles of chairman and chief executive. Despite recent events, there has so far been no change in the plan for Sir Colin to add the post of chairman to his existing responsibilities when Lord King steps aside as chairman in July. The issue of the future shape of the company's board has not been raised in the immediate aftermath of the 'dirty tricks' revelations. Sir Colin said this week there was 'ample time' for the board to consider the issue. Some institutional shareholders yesterday claimed that Sir Michael Angus, a BA non-executive deputy chairman, had told them that Sir Colin 'would not hang around' if he was unable to hold both posts.

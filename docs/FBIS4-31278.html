			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ina Boruszewska: "Council of </F> Ministers--`Strategy for Poland'; Government Approved Kolodko's  Economic Program"]    [Text] "Kolodko's Plan" envisages an increase in the  GDP by about 22 percent over three years, a drop in inflation to  below 10 percent, longer retirement pensions for the elderly,  and longer education for the young. Yesterday, the government  approved the program.    The strategic economic program of Grzegorz Kolodko, finance  minister and deputy prime minister, forecasts that, within three  years, rapid economic growth will take place and will bring  about an improvement in living conditions. "Negotiation  principles of the distribution of the results of labor" were  declared as a "fundamental value" of the program. This is  supposed to decrease the social cost of the reforms. So a  partnershiplike salary system is being proposed through new,  collective labor agreements that would be in accordance with  standards of the European Union. General decisions will be made  during sessions of the Trilateral Commission for Socioeconomic  Issues (government-trade unions-employers), whose legal status  is to be defined shortly.    Rapid economic growth should lead to an increase in the GDP  by about 22 percent by 1997. "Mobilization of domestic savings,  foreign investments, and efficient management of state-owned  wealth" will be conducive to that end. For the purpose of  managing state-owned wealth, an Agency of State Treasury  Property is to be established, which will supervise ownership of  state-owned enterprises transformed into Commercial Law  companies. The National Investment Fund Program is to be  continued, but Kolodko's program does not include a single word  on reprivatization. A governmental draft law on reimbursements  got stuck at the stage of "interministry negotiations."    To Deputy Prime Minister Kolodko, macroeconomic  stabilization  is the most important thing. It is linked to the need to reduce  the rate of increase of the public debt (so that it does not  exceed 60 percent of the GDP by the year 2004) and to reduce the  budget deficit (from 4 percent in 1994 to 2-3 percent in 1997).</p>

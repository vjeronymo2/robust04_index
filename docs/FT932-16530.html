			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Owen urges pressure on Bosnia Serbs LORD Owen, the European Community's peace negotiator for Bosnia, yesterday called for 'relentless pressure' to make Bosnia's Serbs accept the Owen/Vance peace plan. 'Everybody believes that this is a time now to put relentless pressure on the Bosnian Serbs and on the governments of Serbia and Montenegro to come and accept the plan which has been placed before them,' Lord Owen said after briefing European Community foreign ministers. Earlier, foreign and defence ministers of the Western European Union (WEU) decided to tighten the blockade on Serbia's river Danube supply routes, by sending from eight to 10 patrol boats to reinforce sanctions. The WEU, the EC's embryonic defence co-operation arm, intends to help the three Danube states of Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania bottle up arms and oil still reaching Serbia in defiance of UN sanctions. Germany will be sending at least four of the patrol vessels and 50 of the 250-300 personnel expected to man the blockade force. The other WEU and EC members contributing are France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. The WEU move came as EC foreign ministers discussed how to tighten pressure on Serbia, as a means of forcing Bosnian Serbs to agree the peace plan proposed by Lord Owen and Mr Cyrus Vance. In Washington Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, warned the Bosnian Serbs that if they did not agree soon to the Vance/Owen peace plan, the US would start to consult with its allies on the possibility of lifting the arms embargo that now applies to all parties in the former Yugoslavia. However Lord Owen said suggestions that the embargo on Bosnia be lifted selectively to help the Moslem population defend itself were a 'counsel of despair'. He pointed out that this would introduce more modern weaponry into the conflict for all sides.</p>

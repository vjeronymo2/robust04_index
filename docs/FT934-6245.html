			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / World News in Brief: Customs seize arms destined for Ulster terrorists A huge consignment of weapons destined for Northern Ireland terrorists was seized at Teesport, Cleveland, after a joint Customs-MI6 operation. The outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force admitted that the arms had been intended for it. The shipment from Poland included more than 300 assault rifles, handguns, two tons of explosives and thousands of rounds of ammunition. The seizure resulted from an operation that started when Polish authorities uncovered loyalist efforts to buy arms. Picture, Page 8</p>

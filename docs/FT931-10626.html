			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Australian Government Bonds: Long end may extend rally after poll THE Australian government bond market has plenty to mull over in the weeks ahead. Mr Paul Keating, the Australian Prime Minister, yesterday ended months of speculation by calling a national election for March 13, saying that the campaign would be fought on economic issues. In addition, he promised to announce new economic policies tomorrow to 'dramatically expand business opportunities and accelerate economic growth'. Early last week, meanwhile, the Australian bond market sprang back to life as good news on inflation, combined with relative currency stability, triggered a rally at the long end. The market has been subdued since the last easing of monetary policy in June, when official interest rates were cut by 75 basis points to 5.75 per cent - the 12th reduction since rates peaked at 18 per cent in January 1990. The 10-year bond yield has hovered around 9 per cent since September - about 5 percentage points below the February 1989 peak of 14.26 per cent - but looked unlikely to move much lower before the impending election. At the short end, the yield on the 90-day bond has been steady at just below 6 per cent since August, fluctuating occasionally on unfulfilled rumours that official interest rates might be eased. However, the yield on the long bond dipped to 8.6 per cent last week, following the release of the December quarter Consumer Price Index figures which showed that inflation had fallen to a 30-year low of 0.3 per cent. The rally was helped by renewed strength at the long end in the US, and a steadying of the Australian dollar, which has recovered from a low of 66.35 US cents in mid-January to trade at just under 68 cents. The rally at the long end was not reflected at the short end, largely because of indications from the Reserve Bank that official interest rates will not be reduced because of continuing concern about the currency. Investors were clearly impressed by the bank's statement that 'nervousness' in the foreign exchange markets 'effectively precludes' a further easing in monetary policy. However, while the currency is clearly now the main criterion for further interest rate movements, economists say the short-term outlook remains difficult to judge. Precedent suggests that uncertainty about the election result is likely to exacerbate pressure on the Australian dollar caused by weak commodity prices and reduced forecasts for world economic growth. However, the currency may be bolstered by interest rate reductions elsewhere, which would encourage speculative funds to flow into Australia. The currency should also benefit from proposals by the conservative opposition to increase the independence of the Reserve Bank and set tight inflation targets if it wins the election. Mr Chris Caton, chief economist at Bankers Trust Australia, says the medium-term outlook for the dollar is positive, given the early election date. If this view is correct, it may be possible for the authorities to ease monetary policy after the election, or at least to avoid raising interest rates to defend the currency. Whichever party wins the election will seek to stimulate more robust economic growth to reduce unemployment, currently 11.3 per cent, which is in turn contributing to sluggish economic growth. Mr John Dawkins, the treasurer conceded recently that growth in gross domestic product will be limited to 2.5 per cent this year, compared with earlier forecasts of more than 4 per cent. However, fears expressed by private sector economists that the economy will slip back into recession have eased following encouraging figures for retail sales and housing starts. The government also announced last week that the deficit on the current account declined in December, suggesting that the balance of payments may turn out to be a less important constraint on growth than economists feared. The encouraging conclusion is that the outlook for the long bond is bullish, raising the prospect that a further rally to around 8 per cent may be justified after the election. Much will depend, however, on the stability of the currency and the course of interest rate movements overseas.</p>

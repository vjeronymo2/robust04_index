			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Firmer footing as clouds disperse - The expectations of better results from the insurance companies AFTER THREE years of heavy losses, the insurance industry appears to be decisively back on the road to profitability. Three companies, General Accident, Commercial Union and Royal Insurance, will this week report sharp improvements in pre-tax profits for the first six months of 1993. Guardian Royal Exchange and Sun Alliance are expected to follow suit within the next four weeks. Underpinning the turnround has been a combination of rate increases, a fall in the frequency of claims and a gradual reduction in the burden of mortgage indemnity insurance claims. The Association of British Insurers reported a 7.5 per cent fall in theft claims in the first quarter of 1993, compared with the same period of 1992. That indicates that the high incidence of recession-related claims may be beginning to tail off as a result of the first signs of economic recovery. More importantly after the storm losses of 1990 and subsidence losses of 1990 and 1991, insurers benefited from mild weather last winter. Subsidence claims in the first quarter were 60 per cent lower than the corresponding 1992 quarter, which itself showed a big improvement on 1991. Mr Tom Bennett, analyst with Banque Paribas Capital Markets, estimates that losses from DMI policies, which insure mortgage lenders against part of any losses they make when selling repossessed houses, will fall to Pounds 397m in the first half of 1993 and less than Pounds 800m for the whole year. The annual figures for 1992 and 1991 were Pounds 910m and Pounds 1.32bn respectively. In some cases, notably General Accident, companies have reduced costs by rationalising back-room and sales operations and trimming management layers. Trends in the capital and foreign currency markets have also been favourable, helping to strengthen balance sheets dented by recent losses. 'Firm equity markets and more importantly bond market appreciation should yield all the groups substantial capital gains,' says Mr John Chester, of SG Warburg. Mr Chester estimates that the net asset values of General Accident, GRE and Royal have risen by 10 per cent over the past six months with Sun Alliance showing an increase of 6 per cent. He expects Commercial Union to record a 28 per cent enhancement in net asset value due to the effects of February's rights issue. Predictably analysts are expecting pre-tax profits for all companies in 1993 and the upturn to continue into 1994. A possible upturn in rates in the US would provide a further fillip to profitability. However, looking further ahead the picture is a good deal more murky. Part of the reason is that there are already signs of rate competition returning to some parts of the market, especially in motor business. Mr Steven Bird, analyst with Smith New Court, says that the recovery has been too strong. 'The industry is simply not going to be able to stand still and allow the companies to make underwriting profits and increase prices at the same time,' he says. He also predicts that direct telephone-based companies such as Direct Line and Churchill will continue to grow strongly. Mr Youseff Ziai, analyst with Morgan Stanley, agrees. 'Most underwriters now accept that rates are fully adequate. We'll certainly see more evidence of this in the second half and into next year.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- INTERIM PRE-TAX PROFITS (Pounds m)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                               1992       1993 (est)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Commercial Union             (18.1)        60 General Accident             (21.2)       105 GRE                              7*       140* Royal                          (79)        40 Sun Alliance                (114.1)        30  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *includes investment gains of pounds 46m in 1992 and pounds 75m (est) in 1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: SG Warburg  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

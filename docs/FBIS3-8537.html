			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by M.U.: "Walesa: I Must Check the Budget"; last </F> paragraph unattributed]    [Text] Asked whether he will sign the budget, President  Walesa said that he must first check it. "If it corresponds to  my hopes, and these hopes spring from the people, then I will  sign it," he stated.    Lech Walesa declared his support for the head of the  Ministry  of National Defense, who announced that he will institute legal  proceedings in the Constitutional Tribunal because the Sejm  encroached upon the powers of the executive branch by ordering  the Defense Ministry to purchase equipment made exclusively in  Poland. "In new democracies, when new deputies come, they think  that everything depends on them," he added.    Commenting on his conflict with the National Council of  Radio  and Television [KRRiT], the president said: "I expect several  moves that will make the task easier for me." Asked what kinds  of moves he meant, he said: "effective," and, on the part of  KRRiT, moves "making action and life easier for the president."  Asked about the possibility of Ryszard Bender's leaving the  council, he said that he has a few friends in KRRiT. Concerning  Andrzej Zaorski, who is said to be the presidential candidate  for the council's chairman, the president said: "He is a good  expert." As to the candidacy of Aleksander Kwasniewski to the  post of president, he said: "He will definitely be defeated by  me."    Lech Walesa may refuse to sign the Budget Law, just like any  other law. It would then return to the Sejm, which may overturn  the presidential veto with a two-thirds majority vote. The  Sejm's arithmetic suggests that the Sejm should not have any  problem doing just that, if necessary. The lack of the  president's signature would also in no way affect implementation  of the budget.</p>

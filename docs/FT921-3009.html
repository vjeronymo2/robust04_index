			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Nestle wins crucial court case in battle for Perrier NESTLE, the Swiss food group, yesterday won a crucial round in its fight for control of the Perrier mineral water group when a French court invalidated the purchase of a 13.8 per cent stake in Perrier by Saint Louis, the French sugar company. Saint Louis is allied to Italy's Agnelli family, Nestle's opponents in its FFr13.42bn (Pounds 1.37bn) bid for Perrier. This is the second big court case Nestle has won in the battle. Ten days ago another French court froze the voting rights on part of the Perrier shares owned by Exor, the property group that controls Perrier for which the Agnellis are in the throes of an agreed FFr5.6bn offer. These cases will be critical in determining Nestle's chance of winning Perrier. The Agnelli camp, which controlled almost 49 per cent of the voting shares, could have blocked the Swiss group's bid, but this stake is now reduced to 31 per cent, increasing Nestle's room for manoeuvre. 'Nestle now has a very good chance of winning control of Perrier,' said Mr John Graham, European food analyst with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in London. Yesterday's case hinged on whether Perrier had sold the block of new shares to Saint Louis as part of a concert party to block Nestle's bid. The court has now annulled the sale. However Nestle, which joined with Indosuez, the French bank, in bidding for Perrier, will almost certainly have to raise its offer because Exor recently mounted a counter-bid for the rest of the mineral water company's shares at FFr1,475, the same price as Nestle. Perrier's shares rose FFr14 to FFr1,650 in Paris yesterday on expectation of a counter-bid. Analysts agreed Nestle would not have to bid much above the market price to win control unless the Agnellis, who stand to make a profit on their Perrier shares, launch another counter-bid. Conversely the Agnellis, who have been pitted against their old ally, BSN, the French food group which has aligned itself with Nestle by mounting a FFr6bn counter-bid for Exor, could decide to negotiate a settlement. Mr Loic Morvan, food analyst with James Capel in Paris, said the court victories would give Nestle a 'considerable psychological advantage' in negotiations. Lex, Page 22</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A few commenters raised questions about the relationship of the procurement procedures of 24 CFR 85.36 to section 3. The requirements in &sect;85.36 are not inconsistent with part 135. Rather provisions in &sect;85.36 can facilitate actions by the recipients to meet part 135. For example, &sect;85.36(c)(2) expressly prohibits the use of local geographic preferences in the evaluation of bids or proposals, except in the cases where applicable Federal statutes expressly mandate or encourage geographic preference. Section 3 is such a statute encouraging geographic preference. Additionally, the Department notes that neither the section 3 statute nor the part 135 interim rule supersedes the general requirement of 24 CFR 85.36(c) that all procurement transactions be conducted in a competitive manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Reduced Monitoring Responsibilities of Recipients <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several housing authority commenters objected to the requirement in the rule that they must monitor the operations of their contractors and subcontractors to ensure compliance with section 3. They stated that this requirement imposes a significant administrative burden on recipients, and the rule provided no guidance on how recipients should undertake this monitoring function.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The interim rule removes the provision in the proposed rule that required recipients to ``monitor'' the operations of their contractors and subcontractors to ensure compliance with section 3. While the interim rule continues to require that recipients ``ensure'' that their contractors and subcontractors comply with section 3, the rule (see &sect;135.32) clarifies that this responsibility to ``ensure compliance'' means that a recipient: (1) Should refrain from contracting with contractors for which the recipient has received notice or has knowledge that the contractor has been found in violation of the regulations in part 135; (2) should respond to complaints made to the recipient by section 3 residents or section 3 business concerns that a contractor or subcontractor is not in compliance with the part 135 regulations; and (3) must cooperate with the Department in obtaining the compliance of contractors and subcontractors when allegations are made and supported that the recipient's contractors and subcontractors are not in compliance with the regulations of part 135.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Revisions to Enforcement Section <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters criticized the enforcement provisions in the proposed rule. The commenters either found the enforcement provisions too weak, or too severe for a statute that requires recipients, contractors, and subcontractors to make a good faith effort to employ section 3 residents, and contract with section 3 business concerns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department believes that the interim rule provides for an enforcement process that promotes compliance with section 3, provides relief to complainants where appropriate, encourages resolution at the lowest possible level (i.e., resolutions among the parties involved in the complaint), strives for an informal resolution whenever possible, and when necessary, provides for the Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity to impose a resolution on the parties involved, which resolution will be effective unless it is appealed within 15 days of notice of the imposed resolution. The interim rule continues to provide for the referral of the complaint for resolution under the procedures and sanctions provided in the regulations governing the section 3 covered assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Reduced Recordkeeping Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The majority of the commenters complained that the proposed rule was unduly burdensome with respect to recordkeeping requirements. As discussed in this section, the interim rule substantially reduces those requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For HAs, the interim rule removes the regulatory provision that required HAs to undertake specific procurement procedures which required the recipient to negotiate and agree upon, and to document the ``best efforts'' to be undertaken by a contractor before the award of the contract to the contractor. For HAs, the interim rule removes the requirement to amend HA personnel policies to include a statement that the HA's personnel practices provide preference for low- and very low-income persons in training and employment opportunities. For all recipients, the interim rule removes the requirement to amend any written procurement policies to include a statement that the recipient's procurement practices provide preference for section 3 business concerns. For all recipients, the interim rule also removes the requirement to document the mechanism by which the recipient ensured that its contractors and subcontractors complied with the section 3 preference requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, the information that the Department does require is largely information that the recipient, contractor, or subcontractor already maintains. Recipients, contractors, and subcontractors engaged in hiring, or in contracting are already required by other statutes and regulations to maintain information on the number of new hires, the names and addresses of these employees, the race, ethnic origin and gender of the employees, and the positions for which they were employed, and the salary provided. For contracts, the number of contracts awarded, the party to whom the contract was awarded, the nature of the contract and dollar value are data recorded by the recipient or contractor. The additional information that this interim rule requires is the income level of the employees hired (this information is needed to determine if they are section 3 residents) and the status of the business concern as a section 3 business concern. The income level of the employees is information that the Department must have to fulfill its responsibilities under section 3. The statute requires the Secretary of HUD to ensure that economic opportunities are being directed to low- and very low-income persons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Solicitation of Additional Public Comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The foregoing presents the significant changes made to the October 8, 1993 proposed rule by this interim rule. The Department solicits comments on these changes, additional suggestions for implementation of section 3, and such other issues as the commenters believe that the Department should consider before publication of the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Discussion of Additional Public Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section discusses additional issues raised by the commenters, and the Department's response to these issues. These comments may have prompted additional, but less significant, changes to the rule. The discussion begins with comments of general applicability, and is followed by a discussion of comments received on specific sections of the rule. This section does not discuss comments that were either generally laudatory or generally critical of the proposed rule, either of style or substantive comment, or that offered editorial suggestions, or suggestions regarding format that would not affect the meaning of the regulatory provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> General Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that the proposed rulemaking procedure did not provide adequate participation by residents and resident organizations, that the informal meetings held at the Department in March were strictly for the benefit of industry associations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Residents and resident organizations were invited, and attended the two informal meetings held in March 1993. The preamble to the proposed rule did not include a complete listing of all individuals and organizations attending the March meetings. Individuals and organizations representing residents and other low- and very low-income persons that attended these meetings included the National Housing Law Project, the Kenilworth Parkside Resident Management Corporation, the National Association of Resident Management Corporations, and Bromley Heath Tenant Management Corporation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

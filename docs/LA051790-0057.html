			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> Kirk Douglas Collection Sold: "Chasse Croise," a painting of fantastic  personages by Jean Dubuffet, sold for $2 million and ran away with an auction  of 17 works from the collection of Kirk and Anne Douglas on Wednesday at  Christie's New York. The couple put a total of 52 works on the block this month  to raise funds for a collection of contemporary art.  </P> <P> The Dubuffet and Bernard Buffet's "Fleur de Lis," which brought $385,000, were  the only items that exceeded expectations. Eight pieces failed to sell and four  fetched less than their low estimates. Among the sales were a painting of a  white horse and Mexican rider by Marc Chagall ($660,000) and a Georges Braque  still life ($638,000). GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

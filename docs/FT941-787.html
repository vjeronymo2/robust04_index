			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Colosio plot rumours growin Mexico Speculation is mounting in the Mexican press that last week's murder of leading presidential candidate Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio was planned by subversive organisations or even hard-line members of his own party. 'Colosio, victim of a plot' was the front page headline in yesterday's El Universal newspaper. The newspaper offered little in the way of conclusive evidence to support the story. El Universal based its headline on reports, confirmed by the Attorney General's office, that Mr Tranquilino Sanchez Venegas, a security guard hired by the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party in Tijuana, the scene of the murder, had been detained for questioning. Mr Sanchez was held after photographs appeared indicating he might have helped the assassin gain access to Mr Colosio. The photographs are anything but conclusive. The report, along with suggestions Mr Colosio may have been shot with two guns, and not with one as the attorney-general has reported, were enough to spark off a new round of rumours. El Universal usually supports the government. A government official denied Mr Colosio was killed by more than one person, and said scores of witnesses believed there had been just one assassin. The Attorney General's office said Mr Sanchez had no link with official security for Mr Colosio and was hired by local PRI officials to control crowds. Mexico has been awash with rumours that Mr Colosio was murdered by his enemies or those who stood to gain from his removal ever since Wednesday's assassination. Evidence to support the conspiracy theory is thin, but widespread lack of trust in the government and police has allowed the rumours to gain currency. One theory is Mr Mario Aburto, Mr Colosio's confessed assassin, is linked to subversive groups. Ms Graciel Gonzalez, Mr Aburto's 16-year-old girlfriend, told authorities, according to El Universal, that Mr Aburto had spent several weeks in the southern state of Chiapas before and after the New Year armed uprising there, and was sympathetic to the Zapatista rebels. An alternative view, subscribed to by the Zapatistas, is that the murder was planned by so-called dinosaurs (hard-liners against democratic reforms) in the PRI who oppose the reformist wing in the party represented by Mr Colosio.</p>

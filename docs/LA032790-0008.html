			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET UNION  </P> <P> Every day we are bombarded by the media with more and more news of events  occurring in the Soviet Union and are told how quickly the Soviets are  "democratizing."  </P> <P> I hope that as democracy is phased in, the structure of the Soviet Union is  phased out because the two cannot exist together. If you have democracy, you  cannot have a Soviet empire because the two are a contradiction in terms and  meaning. This is especially important in view of how many people were destroyed  during and after the formation of the Soviet Union. Let us not forget those who  were so wantonly annihilated in body and spirit.  </P> <P> ERIC WHITING-JONES  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Surveys disagree on buying trends CONSUMER confidence re-mains low, according to one of two surveys published today. The other says it is greater than a year ago and that high-street loan inquiries are rising. Sharp cuts in interest rates and the devaluation of sterling have failed so far to boost consumer confidence, according to PA Cambridge Economic Consultants, a private-sector economic research company. Its latest quarterly survey of consumer trends, completed on November 29, shows confidence at a new low, with consumers expecting to spend less now than they did a year ago. But Infolink, Britain's largest credit information organisation, said October saw the first rise in consumer credit inquiries for two years. Ms Nevia McKiernan, managing director, added: 'Figures from more recent weeks indicate that consumers are more confident this Christmas than last.' She said the figures represented credit inquiries, not sales. 'It typically takes about six weeks between an inquiry and a sale.' The PA survey indicated that a third of people felt they had been affected by the fall in interest rates. Only 13 per cent said they had reacted by increasing consumption, while 20 per cent had increased savings or cut debt.

			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Survey of France (7): Wages can go down as well as up  / A look at some trends in employment The most depressing thing for Edouard Balladur, who knows his new government will be judged primarily on its unemployment record, is the feeling that he may have failed even before he has properly started. Publicly the prime minister counsels against despair, telling the National Assembly last month that 'there is no reason why France should be condemned to a higher unemployment rate than its neighbours'. But his own government's forecast that unemployment (10.9 per cent in April) will soon surpass France's previous jobless record of 11.1 per cent (in spring 1987), and keep on rising until the end of the year, accords with France's sad track record on job creation. Only the exceptional years of 1988-90, with growth running at nearly 4 per cent, produced a dip in France's unemployment rate. Otherwise it has risen more steadily than in any other industrialised country. The reason is that, largely because of structural rigidities in the labour market, and high payroll taxes acting as an incentive for employers to keep their workforce to a minimum, France has required a minimum of 2.2 per cent annual growth just to maintain the existing number of people in work. By 1995 the French economy might be recovering, but there are no grounds for optimism in the intervening 18 months. Germany's recession is causing France's biggest market to collapse, and to France's immediate north and south French business people face exporters whose goods, priced in devalued sterling, lira and pesetas, have a considerable price advantage over their own. This may not result in a flood of British, Italian and Spanish imports into France. With certain supermarkets vaunting 'Buy French' policies, the country stayed in comfortable trade surplus for the first two months of 1993. But the threat of this import competition is being used by French manufacturers to demand lower wholesale prices from their suppliers - who are increasingly going outside France, and also outside Europe, to north Africa or Asia to have their goods made. And this delocalisation or transfer of production hits employment in France further. There is not much Mr Balladur can do about delocalisation, except to rail vainly for a proper 'social' clause in any new Gatt accord imposing on developing countries the kind of welfare costs that France itself has such difficulty in shouldering. French companies cannot be prevented from taking advantage of cheaper costs, and often equal quality of work, elsewhere. Certain companies have laid themselves open to criticism by Mr Balladur and his ministers, in the abrupt manner in which they have carried out redundancies. For instance: SKF, the Swedish ball-bearing maker, gave its St-Cyr workforce the required notice of its general plan to make 35 redundant - but no advance notice to the unfortunate 35, concerned that they had been chosen for redundancy. SKF thought it was doing the 35 a favour by sending them straight home in taxis. The 35 did not think so - and neither did the politicians. But France's conservatives, when they last came to power in 1986, scrapped the system of administrative control over redundancies; they do not intend to reimpose it. And yet, they have had to resort to other devices, for which they had criticised their Socialist predecessors. One such is the contrats emploi-solidarite (CES), a system of temporary work schemes, in which the Socialists were accused of parking the young unemployed, in order to disguise the number of those without work rather than to improve their chances of getting a real job. Mr Michel Giraud, the new labour minister, plans to increase the number of CES places from 450,000 to 650,000 over the next year. A longer-term aim of the government is to subsidise the doubling (to 400,000) of full apprenticeships in industry over the five-year life of its economic programme. A reason why one in every five young people under 25 is without a job is that the barrier for entry into France's technical institutes is set unnecessarily high. Vocational training places are only for those who pass the all-round tests of France's generally excellent school system. The Patronat employers' federation endorses the idea for more apprenticeships tailored to industry's specific needs. But it says companies can often ill afford the financial jump required in taking apprentices on permanently. France has a minimum wage, known as the SMIC, which currently stands at a uniform rate of FFr 5,756 a month. A recent Paribas study shows that over the past 20 years the SMIC has doubled in real terms, rising much faster than average pay; it claims this prices least-qualified workers out of the job market. When he was finance minister, the late Mr Pierre Beregovoy suggested a lower SMIC for young workers. But he was howled down by fellow Socialists, and no one in the Balladur government would dare tamper overtly with the SMIC. Yet it is no longer unthinkable in France that wages should sometimes go down as well as up. One remedy, heavily touted by the Socialists during the election, was work sharing - the idea of spreading the available work around more people. The notion was largely ridiculed by the conservatives, who said those in existing jobs would never accept less pay for less work, just to add some strangers to their work force. But in the last few months some workers have proved themselves even more self-sacrificing, agreeing to work the same hours for less pay - with the all-important psychological difference that they are saving the jobs of people they know: their colleagues. For example, the work force at Potain, a building company, has agreed to an overall 7 per cent pay cut to save 174 jobs. And staff at Publicis, France's number two advertising agency, have swallowed pay cuts ranging from 2 per cent for the lowest paid to 8 per cent for the highest paid, in order to ward off 30 redundancies. To reward and to encourage such altruism, Mr Giraud came up with a scheme by which the state itself would offer to make up part of the pay cuts. His idea was that the government should only step in financially if and when all other means to prevent redundancies had exhausted. The labour minister promised that any state compensations for pay cuts would be partial, temporary and carefully scrutinised. But the potential for abuse was demonstrated by the behaviour of a Sarrebourg packaging company, Morin Emballages. Suddenly the management gave its 450 employees 48 hours to agree to a 5 per cent pay cut, or face redundancies. A political row followed - and the management backed down. But it was general opposition from both sides of industry which led Mr Giraud to shelve his scheme in mid-June. A more promising structural change has been the government's decision to start shifting some of France's welfare costs from companies' payrolls on to the general budget.</p>

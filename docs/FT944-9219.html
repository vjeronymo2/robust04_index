			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: Profits and sales plunge at Sumitomo Realty Sumitomo Realty and Development, a Japanese property developer, saw sales and profits plunge in the first six months to September due to sluggish sales of high-margin condominiums, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. Non-consolidated recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax - fell 44.4 per cent to Y2.8bn (Dollars 28.7m), while sales nosedived 52.4 per cent to Y90.4bn. After-tax profits plunged 68.2 per cent to Y1.2bn. Part of the decline in revenue was attributed to the fact that in last year's first half the company made a one-off sale of properties as it cut its real estate inventories. Operating profits rose 2.7 per cent to Y20.8bn as the company eliminated Y8.1bn in aid to its financial subsidiary last year. For the full year to next March, it forecasts a 13.3 per cent fall in non-consolidated pre-tax profits to Y7.5bn on a 28.6 per cent drop in sales to Y200bn.</p>

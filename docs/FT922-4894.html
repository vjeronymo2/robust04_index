			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / International Bonds: French franc deals enjoy strong support NEW international bond issues denominated in French francs continued to find strong support yesterday, with the sector attracting new borrowers and international investors. LKB Baden-Wurttemberg, the triple-A rated German financial institution, made its first issue in the sector, raising FFr1bn eight-year funding in a deal lead-managed by BNP Capital Markets. The deal followed a successful sector debut last week by KFW, another German state-backed institution. Syndicate officials said more overseas borrowers were likely to tap the sector while international demand for franc-denominated assets remained strong. In addition, French fund managers are eager to buy bonds issued by new borrowers in order to diversify their credit risk. The market has recently been dominated by a handful of big issuers. The LKB issue met with a good response in Switzerland and the Benelux countries, despite a softer tone in the government bond market. The 8 3/4 per cent paper was re-offered to investors at a fixed price of 99.39, to yield 35 basis points more than French government paper of the same maturity. By the close, the bonds were trading at around 9.33 bid, but the yield spread over government bonds was stable. Volvo Group Finance also made a FFr1bn issue, but at the five-year maturity and lead-managed by Credit Lyonnais. The 9.5 per cent paper was launched late in the day as a re-offering to investors at 99.88, where the yield is 80 basis points more than government paper. Participants in the deal reported a more muted response to the issue, partly because Volvo does not carry a credit rating and remains dependent on the depressed European car market. The deal was held at the fixed re-offer price until the close of trading. Elsewhere, Astra, an Argentine oil company, became the latest Latin American borrower to tap the international market, launching Dollars 100m five-year bonds via Citicorp Investment Bank. The paper pays a 9 1/4 per cent semi-annual coupon and has a put option after three years. The lead manager said that the paper had been priced, on the basis of the put option, to yield 350 basis points over three-year US Treasuries.</p>

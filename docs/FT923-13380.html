			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange WITH ALL eyes on Thursday's meeting of the Bundesbank council, many traders in the derivatives market stayed on the sidelines and there were few features to enliven a quiet session, writes Christopher Price. The September contract on the FT-SE future opened at 2,499 and some early buying interest saw the contract bid up to 2,507. This, however, turned out to be its highest point of the day, as buyers turned shy, preoccupied with weekend press speculation over the gloomy outlook for interest rates, a possible sterling devaluation, and/or a realignment of the ERM. Inevitably, the focus of traders' attention was this Thursday's Bundesbank meeting. From the mid-morning, September drifted away in lifeless trading. A minor lunchtime rally was quickly quashed and the afternoon session remained under a cloud, as flat gilts, US bonds and short sterling added to the air of despondency. September closed at 2,492, down 17 from the previous session and at a 3-point premium to its fair value of around 13. Turnover was a meagre 5,441. In traded options, only a big order in TSB enlivened an otherwise quiet session. A total of 1,180 contracts was dealt, with the December 140 calls accounting for 800 in one order. Midland Bank recorded 921 contracts, as dealers sought to close positions, and ICI managed 681. However, overall a lowly total of 20,613 contracts were traded.</p>

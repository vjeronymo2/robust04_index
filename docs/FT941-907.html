			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Pension funds must heed equities volatility Sir, Your leader, 'More or less safe pensions' (March 23), draws attention to the very important shift of emphasis in the valuation of pension fund assets. The possible introduction of a minimum solvency standard, combined with the advancing maturity of many pension funds, means that the focus is increasingly on the market value of assets rather than the assumed value of the future income streams, which have been the measure of health in the past. The effective smoothing of stock market volatility by actuaries has allowed the average UK pension fund to invest up to 85 per cent of its assets in equities without embarrassment. Many commentators have suggested that mature pension funds, in which the difference between full funding and insolvency may be modest, should reduce their equity exposures. I would broadly agree with this preliminary conclusion, and would like to draw attention to the other important investment consideration, which is where the equities should be invested. UK pension funds invest almost 70 per cent of their equities in the UK market. About 90 per cent of the volatility in UK equities is smoothed out by the actuarial methodology. By contrast, the same methodology has virtually no impact on the volatility of international equities, ie there is a huge bias in favour of UK equities introduced by the smoothing process. In the new world of market values, the full impact of volatility in both UK and international equity markets will be felt by pensions funds. Thus to have 70 per cent of the fund's exposure in a single market could appear very risky. Any objective analysis of the effect of international diversification, in which UK and international equities are treated consistently, will show that UK exposure should be reduced, perhaps to 50-60 per cent of total equities. The UK equity component may be lower still if the currency exposure of the international investments is hedged back to sterling. Mr Eric Lambert's letter (March 24) is interesting in this regard. It confirms that many of the funds which his company monitors are maturing. However, I do not believe he will have observed as yet any reduction in average equity exposures or change in the split between UK and international. While it is interesting to know how the consensus invests, this does not necessarily mean it is right, nor that it is appropriate for most pension funds. It is a fantasy to believe one's position in a league table will be the prime measure of success or failure in the future.

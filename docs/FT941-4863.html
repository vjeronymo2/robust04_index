			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Gartmore higher than forecast Gartmore, the UK-based fund management company yesterday reported pre-tax profits for 1993 of Pounds 24.6m, nearly Pounds 2m higher than forecast when its shares were first offered to the public last November. Banque Indosuez floated 25 per cent of its stake in Gartmore last November in a sale that valued the company at about Pounds 338m. Profits would have been Pounds 2.7m higher had it not been for non-recurring items relating to the disposition of a loan and staff retention scheme set in place when Banque Indosuez was the sole owner. A year earlier it had a loss of Pounds 2.15m after Pounds 17.1m of non-recurring charges relating mainly to a loan from Banque Indosuez. Earnings were 8.7p a share against a loss of 1.8p. It plans to pay its first post-flotation dividend at the half-year. Gartmore's funds under management grew 64 per cent in 1993 to Pounds 21bn, with net new money up Pounds 4.2bn. The remainder of the growth was accounted for by market movements and investment returns. Mr Paul Myners, executive chairman, said the rate of new business growth was highly unusual for Gartmore or for the industry generally and is unlikely to be repeated. 'We would discourage analysts and others from forecasting this rate of growth,' he said. Mr Myners said that to handle the influx of new cash, Gartmore had increased its staff numbers by 36, mostly adding fund managers and client service managers. Industry analysts have said that the greatest difficulty facing Gartmore, now one of the so-called 'Big Four' UK pension fund managers, is whether it can manage the rapid increase in funds under management without damaging investment performance or client servicing capacity. Mr David Watts, managing director of Gartmore's pension fund management business, said that the growth in assets had made rapid execution of portfolio shifts somewhat more difficult. Gartmore has begun to ask its clients for permission to use derivatives to gain access to markets quickly at lower execution costs.</p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome hint Pharmaceutical group Wellcome was dragged down with the market, but one leading US analyst was telling clients that the UK company could be the next target for a signif-icant merger or takeover in the sector. Dr Jonathan Gelles of Wertheim Schroder believes the US holding in Wellcome, officially about 3.6 per cent, has doubled in the past month. The performance of the shares reflects buying interest, probably from the US. Wellcome has outperformed the FT-SE Actuaries All-Share Index by 9.5 per cent, and the sector by more than 5 per cent, since the start of June. Dr Gelles argues that Wellcome Trust, which still controls 40 per cent of the company, is only interested in maximising profits in order to further research and would be quite happy to see a merger or acquisition. He believes the company has a take-out value equivalent to about 900p a share. Yesterday the shares retreated 16 to 586p.</p>

			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> SUMMIT STATUS ELUDES ALBANIA  </P> <P> Officials of neighboring Balkan states today gave only qualified support to  Albania's taking part in European affairs, and Greece insisted that the  isolated, hard-line Communist nation make human-rights reforms.  </P> <P> Albania's chances of gaining international acceptance were further damaged  today as its most famous author, Ismail Karare, defected.  </P> <P> Karare announced that he would seek political asylum in France because, he  said, there was "no possibility of legal opposition" in his homeland.  </P> <P> Word of Karare's defection reached Tirana just after the foreign ministers'  meeting closed, and there was no immediate official Albanian reaction.  </P> <P> Albania, hosting its first high-level international conference in decades,  hopes to be invited to the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, in  Paris, in time for its summit session next month.  </P> <P> But the Balkan foreign ministers, at their meeting here today, did not give a  clear endorsement to Albania's participation in the summit.  </P></p>

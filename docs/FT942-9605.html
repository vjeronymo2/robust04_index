			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Inflation data fails to lift US equities Wall Street More good news on inflation failed to provide stocks with much of a lift yesterday, even though the data lifted bond prices, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up only 6.84 at 3,659.68, having spent the entire day no more than a few points either side of opening values. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's also ended little changed, up 0.41 at 444.16, while the American Stock Exchange composite finished down 0.78 at 432.57 and the Nasdaq composite down 2.69 at 716.92. Trading volume was 253m shares, and declines outpaced rises by 1,068 to 1,068. For the second day, there was some surprisingly good news on inflation. After Thursday's unexpected 0.1 per cent decline in the April producer price index, yesterday's news of a 0.1 per cent increase in April's consumer price index also confounded analysts, who had forecast an increase of 0.3 per cent in the CPI. Taken together, the data was the best indication yet that inflation is not a major threat to financial markets. Yet, apart from a brief surge of buying at the opening and again mid-morning, stocks did not gain much benefit from the figures. This was mostly because bond prices failed to make much headway, as fixed-income investors turned their attention to next Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy- making open market committee. The FOMC is expected to sanction a rate increase at the meeting, and investors are nervous about how another tightening will be received by the markets. Although bond prices began to recover later in the day, stock failed to derive much strength from the Treasury market. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was up more than half a point, and the yield was down to 7.481 per cent, yet blue-chip stocks struggled to stay in positive territory. Secondary indices fared even less well, with the Nasdaq composite under particular pressure because of weakness in technology stocks. Among individual issues, Time Warner climbed Dollars 1 to Dollars 38 5/8 amid renewed speculation that the entertainment group faces a possible bid from its major shareholder, Seagram. Yesterday's story was that Mr Barry Diller, head of the QVC home shopping channel, had accumulated Time Warner shares with the intention of backing Seagram. Philip Morris was another notable gainer, rising Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 52 1/8 on hopes that the company will split its tobacco and food interests. Sprint firmed Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 36 5/8 on reports that it is discussing an alliance with Electronic Data Systems which will combine Sprint's telecommunications know-how with EDS' data-processing power to compete in the multi-media business. EDS shares edged Dollars  1/8 higher to Dollars 33. On the Nasdaq market, concern about slow growth in the computer networking products business hit technology stocks hard. Cisco tumbled Dollars 5 3/4 to Dollars 23 1/4 , Wellfleet fell Dollars 8 to Dollars 63 1/2 , and 3 Com dropped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 55. Canada Toronto stock prices closed modestly higher in relatively light trading, to end a jittery week on a high note. According to preliminary figures, the TSE-300 index rose 12.83 points, or 0.31 per cent, to close at 4,175.35. Advancing issues outnumbered declines 411 to 327. Preliminary volume was 57.039m shares, up from Thursday's 52.933m shares, and trading value rose to CDollars 532.7m from CDollars 509.4m. Nine of Toronto's 14 sub-indexes closed higher, led by mining, up 2.1 per cent as base-metal prices surged. Inco jumped 1 to 33 3/8 on higher nickel prices. Mitel Corp lost  3/8 to 5 after the company said its fourth-quarter earnings fell to CDollars 4.8m. Oshawa Group reported first-quarter net income up to CDollars 8.9m. Oshawa Group A shares gained  1/4 to 20.</p>

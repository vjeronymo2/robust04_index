			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Ivory Coast clamps down on opposition MR Alasane Ouattara, prime minister of the Ivory Coast, has promised stiff measures against the political opposition, students and 'law breakers' whose activities, he said, threatened one of the most far-reaching structural adjustment programmes under way in Africa. In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Ouattara said: 'Last year we went through a tough period cleansing the economy, making it healthier. Now it is time to cleanse the political environment.' Since January the wave of anti-government demonstrations organised by students and the main opposition party, the Ivorian Popular Front (FPI) have erupted into violent rioting and destruction of property and cars on the streets of Abidjan. Last Friday the court gave jail sentences to 12 people for involvement in the most recent incident. Among those sentenced was Mr Laurent Gbagbo, leader of the FPI and a member of the National Assembly. Reacting to the controversial court decision Mr Ouattara said: 'They will have to know there are laws and if they break them they must be punished. We need a responsible opposition.' The prime minister said his 18-month-old 'technocratic' government had moved swiftly to resuscitate the ailing economy, hit by falling prices, negative economic growth and external debts of Dollars 14bn. Last year the government moved from a four-year deficit into a surplus of CFA15bn (Dollars 54m) on the budget balance before debt service payment. Radical measures to restructure an estimated CFA1,100bn of domestic debt, including CFA450bn of arrears owed to the banking sector, are also under way. Mr Ouattara said his government's privatisation programme would be speeded up over the next 12 months with eight companies including the telecommunication giant sold off to private investors. He ruled out devaluation of the West African franc zone.</p>

			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Lunn Poly faces legal threat from Pickfords PICKFORDS TRAVEL is threatening Lunn Poly, the UK's largest chain of travel agents, with legal action over its refusal to carry holiday brochures of seven tour operators offering discounts through Pickfords shops, Michael Skapinker writes. Pickfords said yesterday that it would take legal action if Lunn Poly did not agree to carry the brochures by noon today. The threat follows an instruction from Lunn Poly to its shops on January 23 telling them to take the brochures of the seven operators off their racks and replace them with holiday information from other companies. The operators concerned are The Club, French Life, Jetsave, Meon, Novotours, Seasun and Sunset. Lunn Poly told its shops that bookings for those companies could be accepted if demanded by customers but that no effort should be made to promote their holidays. It told its shops the reason for the action was that 'these operators are sponsoring activity with our competitors'. Lunn Poly confirmed that it had issued the instruction to its shops and said it was 'normal commercial practice'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Monica Gugliano] </F>   [Text] Brasilia -- The fact that PT [Workers Party]  presidential candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva may be  victorious in the elections is robbing many businessmen of their  sleep. Will Lula maintain market rules? What will he do with  the foreign debt? What would the size of the state be during a  possible PT administration? Will he be able to keep control of  the different factions within his party? These are some of the  questions that concern domestic and multinational companies,  which have hired the services of consultants to draw up the  profile for a possible PT administration. So far, the forecasts  made by the companies are discouraging.    Former Minister Mailson da Nobrega from MCM Consultants  said:  "We are working on two possible scenarios -- one in which there  will be a centrist administration, and another one with a  leftist administration. The scenario with Lula is the most  negative one."    Consultant firms are for the time being betting that the  presidential election will be decided between the PSDB  [Brazilian Social Democratic Party] candidate, Fernando Henrique  Cardoso, and Lula.    Consultant Walder de Goes said: "The succession has already  polarized between Cardoso and Lula. All public opinion polls  agree with this."    According to the consultants' assessment, Lula's election as  president could trigger a flight of capital.    Da Nobrega foresees that "the banks that grant lines of  credit ranging from $25 to $30 billion are the very ones on  which Lula and his team are threatening to declare a moratorium.  If Lula is elected president, those lines of credit will be  considerably curtailed."    The reasons underpinning the negative forecasts are  manifold,  and increase every time Lula changes his remarks and evinces  ambiguity in his proposals. The PT platform, for example,  proposes the rescheduling of Brazil's external debt. Yet the  bankers who have heard Lula and Deputy Aloizio Mercadante  [PT-SP] [Sao Paulo] in the United States were concerned.    Da Nobrega stated that "Lula and Mercadante frightened their  audience with their ignorance and defiant manner."    Goes said: "The scenario portends difficulties, but if at a  certain moment it becomes clear that Lula will win the  elections, strategies to adapt to this situation will start to  crop up. Nobody wants to destroy the country just because the  PT won the elections."    Another great concern is to try to fathom how the different  PT factions will behave.    Da Nobrega noted that "the fragmentation of the PT into so  many factions gives rise to much confusion. Everybody is  convinced that the apparent party union is only geared to  winning the elections."    Last week, Lula's remarks to justify the use of a sound  truck  from the ABC Metallurgic Trade Union for an election rally  caused a rise in the temperature of mistrust.    Moreover, among all the negative assessments of a possible  PT  administration, the forecast that Lula will not have a majority  in Congress, and that he will find it difficult to make  alliances with other parties, is the one that carries the most  weight.    Evaristo Dias, from Santafe Ideias, states that "from an  ideological standpoint, there is no concern about Lula's  administration. There is, however, real fear, which stems from  his remarks rather than from what they represent."  <H5>  Profiles of Consultant Firms </H5>   Rosenberg Consultoria e Associados: Provides analyses and  follow-up of macroeconomic and financial projects.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In connection with the issue of expanding market  access for U.S.-made cellular phones, the U.S. Government has  asked the Japanese Government to "guide" the Japan Mobile  Communications Company (JMCC) to build more ground stations for  U.S.-made cellular phones. The request has been made by  Charlene Barshevsky, deputy U.S. trade representative, to  Masahito Tani, deputy minister of the Posts and  Telecommunications Ministry. "The United States is said to have  not indicated the specific number of ground stations for the  U.S.-made cellular phones" (says a source at the ministry), but  there is a possibility that the United Stats will ask Japan to  set numerical targets in the future. The Japanese Government is  refusing the request, saying, "This is not an issue to be  handled between the governments of the two countries but rather  is one to be handled between the private sector companies of the  two countries."    The issue has existed since last December when the U.S.  Trade  Representative launched an investigation last December, claiming  that "there is a possibility that Japan has not complied with an  agreement on cellular phones which was concluded between Japan  and the United States in December 1989" and dropping hints about  sanctions against Japan in accordance with the Omnibus Trade  Act. The results of the investigation will be released on 15  February.    The main point of the Japan-U.S. agreement on cellular  phones  is that Japan will permit Motorola-style cellular phones to  operate in the Tokyo area and in Japan's centers of population  by allotting new frequencies to the phones. In complying with  the agreement, the JMCC has begun a Motorola-style cellular  phone service in addition to the conventional-style cellular  phone service provided by the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone  Corporation (NTT).    The Motorola-style cellular phone service covers smaller  areas than the NTT-style cellular phone service because of the  difference in the number of ground stations for the two cellular  phone services. For this reason, about 300,000 cars subscribe  to the NTT-style cellular phone service, whereas about 10,000  cars subscribe to the Motorola-style cellular phone service.  This unequal arrangement has triggered complaints by the United  States.    According to the JMCC, the number of ground stations for the  Motorola-style cellular phone service will be increased to 190  by April, but this figure is less than half of 430 ground  stations serving the NTT-style cellular phone service. The JMCC  has announced plans to increase the number of ground stations  for the Motorola-style cellular phone service after April by 100  over the next two years. According to the Posts and  Telecommunications Ministry, the U.S. Government has yet to  express its satisfaction with the figure. Motorola said, "At  the moment, we decline to make any comment, but we intend to  observe how the governments of the two countries will negotiate  on the issue."</p>

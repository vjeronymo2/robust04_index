			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / International Company News: Minebea tumbles into the red and suspends payouts MINEBEA, the world's leading maker of miniature bearings, reported a net loss of Y64.8bn (Dollars 581m) for the six months ended March, following a restructuring of its loss-making electronics operations. The company, which made a Y2.1bn profit for the same period last year, said sales rose 7 per cent to Y105bn, while pre-tax profit was 4 per cent higher Y4.17bn. It will suspend dividend payments for the first time since 1965. Minebea is now paying the price for an erratic diversification programme which included a door-to-door cosmetics company, a semiconductor business, and pig farms, all of which proved unsuccessful. Sales of bearings and some electronics products have improved with a recovery in computer demand in the US, while the sale of NMB Semiconductor, to Nippon Steel should help to clear the balance sheet. First-half accounts included a special loss of Y54bn related to that sale. The company hopes the recovery in stock prices and a recently-announced government spending package will stimulate domestic capital spending. Minebea forecasts a 4.5 per cent rise in full-year sales to Y210bn, and 3 per cent growth in pre-tax profit to Y8.5bn. Omron, a maker of control equipment, says pre-tax profits fell 48 per cent to Y7bn in 1992-93.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A group of members of Ukraine's newly-elected  parliament are going to propose an amendment to the Constitution  to strip the president of much of his authority, according to  Rukh party leader Vyacheslav Chernovil.    In that case the president would only be the head of state  and not the head of state and government as today, Chernovil  told a news conference in Kiev on Tuesday.    He said it would hardly be possible to postpone the  presidential election, something proposed by President Leonid  Kravchuk, because a motion to that effect would need the support  of at least 170 legislators and because the preparations for the  26 June election "have already gone too far." Nevertheless  Chernovil expects the matter to be brought up at one of initial  parliament sessions.    At the same time, he said he considered it "immoral" to hold  a presidential election before the legislature delineated the  future president's powers.    Chernovil said his party would not propose its own candidate  to the post of parliamentary speaker "unless the Communists  nominate their own candidate."    According to the Central Electoral Commission, Rukh has won  20 seats in the new parliament, or 5.9 percent of the total  number.</p>

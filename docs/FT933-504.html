			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / French Privatisation: France sees the Renault-Volvo merger as Act One - Balladur's privatisation policy will take a lead from the union of the car groups THE MERGER between Renault and Volvo, agreed this month and to take effect from the beginning of 1994, was described by one French Industry Ministry official as 'the first grand act of this government's industrial policy.' It is unlikely to be the last. Mr Gerard Longuet, industry minister in the centre-right government of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, has other ambitious proposals in his in-tray. They involve the formation of corporate alliances to increase the competitiveness of French public companies and ease the shackles of state control. They also involve a paradox - to reduce the role of the state in industrial affairs, it may first be necessary to intervene more. Such intervention is likely to follow a pattern established by the Renault-Volvo merger. The most important objectives of this alliance from the perspective of the French government - the strengthening of Renault in international markets, and the preparation of the company for privatisation  -are themes in the government's other proposals. Among these are plans to change the legal status of France Telecom from a state agency to a joint stock company. A law to effect this is expected to be proposed by early next year. The aim is to enable France Telecom to exchange shareholdings with other telecommunications groups and strengthen its position ahead of the liberalisation of the European telecommunications market at the beginning of 1998. The French government already has foreign allies in mind. Mr Longuet, for example, has described Germany's Deutsche Bundespost Telekom as 'a natural partner on the European continent'. Also under consideration is a proposal to combine Pechiney, the aluminium manufacturer with Compagnie Nationale du Rhone, the electricity generator. Pechiney, like Renault, is on the list of 21 state-controlled groups which the government has said it intends to privatise. A tie-up with CNR might make the sale of the loss-making aluminium concern more attractive. Officials at the Industry Ministry describe the idea as 'a working hypothesis' and say the proposal is at an early stage. However, it met with a warm response from Mr Jean Gandois, Pechiney's chairman. According to Mr Gandois, CNR could bring a stable supply of low-cost electricity to his group, France's single biggest electricity consumer. From the point of view of the government, CNR could represent a stable investor to help replace the state on Pechiney's share register. Further down the in-tray is the possibility of a restructuring at Thomson, the electronics group. Of the companies on the government's privatisation list Thomson is unique in having two distinct operations, the loss-making consumer electronics division, and the profitable defence electronics business. Government officials emphasise that the goal is to increase efficiency with the ultimate aim of reducing the state's role. 'Many state-controlled groups require reorganisation,' said one official. This is particularly the case as the government moves down the list of companies to be privatised. The first four privatisation issues - Banque Nationale de Paris, Rhone Poulenc, the chemicals group, Banque Hervet, and Elf-Aquitaine, the oil group - are all in relatively good shape. Banque Hervet is loss-making, but small. Along with the three bigger groups, its sale is not expected to present any substantial problems. Beyond these four, however, the task becomes more difficult. About half of the companies on the auction block are loss-making. Some, such as Bull, the computer manufacturer, and Air France require substantial restructuring to return to profitability and eventual sale. Given that the government has committed FFr40bn (Pounds 4.6bn) of privatisation proceeds to its budget this year and FFr50bn next year, it is under pressure to shake up the public sector. There are, however, limits. On a practical level, industrial restructuring is a complex process. 'You can't just play Meccano with industry,' said one official. Renault and Volvo took three years to transform their strategic alliance into a full merger. An alliance or merger between Pechiney and CNR, for example, would probably be resisted by EDF, the state electricity group, which holds 17 per cent of CNR. On a political level, too, there are constraints. This month Mr Balladur urged state groups to minimise job losses in an attempt to curb rising unemployment. To the extent that public industry is restricted in cutting costs, such intervention could delay, rather than hasten, France's grand acts of privatisation.</p>

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Survey of Packaging and the Environment (9): No flash in the pan - Case study, Tomlinson MANY MARKETING ideas are born in unusual circumstances, but few come in stranger ways than Peter Kelly's. Lying in a hospital bed with a dislocated shoulder, the director of a pulp-moulding machinery manufacturer started ruminating about the German shiny steel bed pans that the nurses brought round for the patients' relief. 'Why can't we make those?' he thought. And so he did. His company, Tomlinson, which was founded in Rochdale in 1853, had for the past 20 years supplied the machinery used for pulping waste paper to produce egg cartons. Its machines were all exported for use in more than 100 countries, mainly in the third world. But Mr Kelly believed that the move towards environmental awareness in the industrialised world could perhaps provide new markets for pulp-moulded products. Tomlinson could develop from a capital plant manufacturer towards an integrated packaging group. From his initial thought, Mr Kelly persuaded the company to investigate the possibilities. The company designed a new rotary machine, in collaboration with the University of Salford, and invested in computer-aided design facilities to produce the necessary moulds for an array of different applications. It found that the material, which it called Fibrepack, could be used for a wide variety of products, such as soap packages, cosmetics cases, hand tool boxes and telephone and computer packaging insulation. 'We can now tailor-make pulp moulded packaging to the individual client's needs,' he says. Tests showed that Fibrepack had good cushioning properties, and enhanced the protection afforded to many products. It could also be laminated to make it water-resistant. The company believes there will be good consumer acceptance of Fibreapack, which can be disposed of at traditional paper recycling banks. 'The material has been around for years in egg boxes. All we are doing is giving it new applications,' he says. Mr Kelly, a former academic at the School of Oriental and African Studies who later honed his marketing skills as a commercial trader in the Middle East, says he was startled by the response from manufacturers who were interested in using the new material: 'We started it all on a wing and a prayer. But we are now in a situation where this has taken off in a completely unplanned way. People are trying to be the first into the marketplace with alternative environmental products.' Tomlinson is about to set up a new plant just to make medical products out of the material for the National Health Service. The company has already sold two medical products machines to a manufacturer in Italy. Mr Kelly claims that it costs 17p in terms of labour, energy and capital equipment depreciation every time a traditional bedpan is sterilised in an autoclave. The pulp-moulded variety costs 3p. Once soiled they go into a special macerator. Mr Nigel Watts, chairman and managing director of Tomlinson, who led a management team that bought the family-run company three and a half years ago, says the new markets are providing it with great growth opportunities. 'When we took over, the company had turnover of Pounds 1m. We have invested heavily in new product development and got the turnover up to Pounds 5m. This year we will get to Pounds 10m,' he says. Mr Watts believes there are particularly good market opportunities in North America and Japan. 'There has been a major shift in emphasis in our business away from the third world to the first world, and that shift is entirely due to environmental emotion. We have got a product that anticipates the legislative climate that is emerging,' he says. But the company has encountered some embarrassing moments in trying to sell its products, not least when it received strong protests from old soldiers in the Royal British Legion when it unfurled a Japanese flag to welcome a visiting trade delegation. In overseas markets, Tomlinson plans to export its machines and exploit Fibrepack's appeal through forming local joint ventures with packaging companies with marketing expertise. Paper collection systems and markets for recycled products vary enormously throughout the world. In Australia, for example, Mr Kelly says huge amounts of waste paper are collected through Rotary clubs. Pulp moulding machinery can greatly help countries to improve their recycling capabilities. Mr Kelly cites the example of Tasmania, which at one time had to ship all its waste newspapers to Australia and re-import the reprocessed material, because it did not have any suitable pulp mills itself. With Tomlinson's machines, he claims that Tasmania can now put its old newspapers to good use. Mr Kelly also takes particular pride in the company's record of selling paper-converting equipment to the Scandinavians - an achievement he likens to selling fridges to the Eskimos. 'We have done all this within the constraints of our Lowry-style mill in Rochdale,' he says. Tomlinson's corporate evolution will also have some substantial financial benefits. Over the past two years, the company has had some scary moments with its banks, because of the strains imposed by high development costs. 'One of the problems of a capital plant manufacturer,' says Mr Kelly, 'is that you build a machine and get paid, and then you sit around waiting to sell the next big machine. So you have a highly unstable cash-flow position. Packaging sales will now provide the group with a steady income.' Nevertheless, he accepts that the company will face a tough job in establishing its Fibrepack product in consumer markets, and will confront a considerable challenge in managing its fast pace of growth. But he smiles, and says that, whatever happens, he will always derive a quiet satisfaction from the knowledge that his pulp moulding machines are daily turning newspapers into bedpans.</p>

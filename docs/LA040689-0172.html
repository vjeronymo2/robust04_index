			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REGULATORS IN 3 MIDWEST STATES SEEK CONTROL OF MAXICARE UNITS  </P> <P> State regulators in the Midwest said Wednesday that they have formally moved to  have Maxicare Health Plans Inc.'s operations in those states dismissed from the  company's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.  </P> <P> If the motion filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana is successful,  Maxicare Health Plans of the Midwest Inc., which operates the company's health  maintenance organizations in Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, could be controlled by  those states. The states could force a liquidation of the plans if they decide  that is the best way to protect members and ensure payments of debts owed to  medical-care providers.  </P> <P> Also Wednesday, Maxicare released a preliminary financial report showing that  it lost $267.8 million in 1988. The company said the report reflects operating  results only; Maxicare doesn't yet know how it will treat the effects of the  Chapter 11 proceedings. The company reported revenue of $1.67 billion for the  year.  </P> <P> Maxicare also said it no longer intends to sell its California HMO, which  analysts have said it should retain to rebuild the company as a profitable  concern in the future.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Option to Switch  </P> <P> On yet another front, Maxicare was trying to stop employers from allowing  Maxicare members to switch to other health-care plans. Some employers have  decided to give their employees the option immediately to remain with a  Maxicare plan or switch to another medical plan.  </P> <P> The U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which represents federal employees,  recently sent a notice to employees in several states explaining Maxicare's  financial problems and saying that employees have the option to switch, said  spokesman Dick McGowan. Xerox Corp. also has informed Maxicare members that  they have the option of switching to the in-house Xerox Medical Plan.  </P> <P> "Some employees are anxious to move out of Maxicare. Others are not," said  Patricia Nazemetz, Xerox's director of benefits.  </P> <P> Maxicare spokeswoman Tobi Nyberg said the company believes that the OPM is  violating a federal court order obtained shortly after the March 16 bankruptcy  filing. The company intends to seek a restraining order against OPM, she said,  but not enough is known about the Xerox situation to take action.  </P> <P> The March 16 order bars doctors, hospitals and other health-care providers from  refusing to treat Maxicare members solely because of the company's past-due  debts. Such orders are typical in Chapter 11 cases in which companies seek to  prevent suppliers of essential goods and services from shutting them down.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Consulting Attorneys  </P> <P> Nyberg said Maxicare believes that the order also prevents employers from  changing their normal group insurance enrollment periods to allow employees to  leave Maxicare. Typically, employers have open enrollment periods once a year,  usually in January, to allow employees to switch plans if they choose to do so.  Some employers also hold special open enrollments to accommodate special  circumstances. Both Xerox and OPM said their actions can't be characterized as  open enrollments.  </P> <P> Some employers have moved cautiously in advising employees on whether they can  switch. But several are known to be consulting with attorneys on whether the  court order applies to them.  </P> <P> The issue may end up in court, said Robert F. Atlas, a Washington health-care  consultant who advises employers on group health plans. "There is nothing in  employers' contracts with HMOs that says they can't allow employees to switch.  There is nothing that says they have to guarantee a minimum number of members."  </P> <P> The challenge from state regulators is a serious threat, Atlas said, adding  that bankruptcy court control is Maxicare's best chance for survival as a  corporation. If state regulators are in control, the corporation's survival  will be their least concern, he said.  </P> <P> State control might be the best option for "the greater good," Atlas said. "If  the bankruptcy goes through and Maxicare is not able to recover, a lot of  members will be left out in the cold. Doctors and hospitals will end up eating  a lot of losses if that happens," he said.  </P> <P> State regulators argue that the plans in Illinois, Ohio and Indiana are  insurance companies, which are prohibited by federal bankruptcy law from filing  under Chapter 11.  </P> <P> Last week, the three states agreed to delay pressing their case in court while  Maxicare attempted to place the members in other plans. Arnold Dutcher,  Illinois deputy insurance commissioner, said the motion was filed because  Maxicare didn't seem to be moving quickly enough to sell the plans. "We filed  to get in line on what looks like is going to be a very crowded court docket  regarding this case," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not Trying to Sell  </P> <P> Only Illinois and Indiana officials actually filed the motion, but Ohio also  would be governed by the ruling. Ohio Deputy Insurance Commissioner Neil Rector  said the department didn't formally join the motion because it believes that  Maxicare is very close to a deal to sell the Ohio membership.  </P> <P> Nyberg said Maxicare isn't actively trying to sell any of the Midwest plans  because it wants to remain in the states. "There was no agreement. This was  their idea," she said. However, she said, Maxicare has been negotiating with  Ohio officials and, as a "show of good faith," agreed to consider bids for the  Ohio plan that were solicited by Ohio officials. "We're not ruling out the  possibility that the plan will be sold. Some of the bids may make sense for  us," she said.  </P> <P> Dutcher said Maxicare Midwest, with a membership of about 250,000, lost $12.3  million in 1988. "All of it occurred in the first three quarters. The fourth  quarter was a break-even quarter with the profits in Indiana and Illinois equal  the losses in Ohio," he said.  </P> <P> Maxicare's California plan lost about $4.2 million in the first nine months of  1988, according to the latest available records from the State Department of  Corporations. Nyberg said the company decided to keep the unit because the  Chapter 11 filing had solved some cash flow problems.  </P> <P> In recent weeks, Maxicare has sold its Tucson, Ariz., plan and shut down the  Phoenix operation. About 12,000 Phoenix members were transferred to 11 other  HMOs, Nyberg said. Currently, the company has entered into agreements to sell  its Seattle and Alabama units. Maxicare now has about 900,000 members  nationwide.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EX-PITCHER RECORDING HIS BIGGEST WALK  </P> <P> Jim Rooker had plenty of walks and strikeouts in a 12-year major league  pitching career, but he has never struck out on a walk like this.  </P> <P> The Pittsburgh Pirates' announcer hopes to last 12 days on "Rook's  Unintentional Walk," a 315-mile trek across Pennsylvania that started today in  Philadelphia and resulted from a quip made during a June 8 broadcast.  </P> <P> The Pirates seemed on their way to ending a six-game losing streak by taking a  10-0 lead in the first inning in Philadelphia.  </P> <P> "If we lose this game, I'll walk home," Rooker, 47, told broadcast partner John  Sanders.  </P> <P> "You'll have to," Sanders said.  </P> <P> "I won't have to, but I will," Rooker said.  </P> <P> The Pirates wound up losing 15-11, but Rooker accompanied them home. Back in  Pittsburgh, so many fans questioned Rooker about the off-the-cuff comment, he  agreed to walk from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh for charity.  </P> <P> Rooker, who will be accompanied by a support crew in a motor home, plans to  walk a minimum of 18 miles and a maximum of 33 miles a day, weather permitting.  </P> <P> Rooker knows the walk could have been worse.  </P> <P> "I could have said it in Los Angeles," he said.  </P></p>

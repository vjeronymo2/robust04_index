			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AND NOW THE SCRAMBLE STARTS  </P> <P> The impending retirement of Rep. Augustus (Gus) F. Hawkins not only marks the  end of a long political career but also will provide a major break in a  frustrating political logjam in Southern California's African American  community. In a region where election to public office can mean a job for life  for most politicians, the unexpected vacancy provides an opportunity for  challenge and change in the local black political landscape.  </P> <P> State Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) is, by many accounts, the  leading candidate in the race to replace Hawkins, an octogenarian who has been  an admired member of Congress for nearly three decades. Waters is the  best-known candidate in the largely black and Latino district centered in Watts  and including South Gate, Huntington Park and part of Downey.  </P> <P> By choosing to run for the Hawkins seat, Waters opened up her 48th Assembly  District seat, and that's where the real political scramble is taking place.  Four Democrats have filed to replace Waters, Los Angeles City Councilman Robert  Farrell among them. Farrell need not relinquish his seat to run for the  Assembly. If he moves up, however, his council seat -- the Eighth District,  which represents the predominantly black neighborhoods that stretch south from  USC -- would be up for grabs. And would-be successors to Farrell are already  doing their political homework because a missed opportunity may translate into  a decade of waiting for another chance.  </P> <P> But the significance of the changes that could take place on the South Side  transcend the ambition of a few political leaders. The rare vacancies -- and  the prospect of tightly contested races to fill them -- also provide an  opportunity for fresh debate about the deteriorating social conditions -- about  drugs, gangs, poverty and not enough housing, education, health care and  economic growth -- and what can be done to change things.  </P> <P> Gus Hawkins has had a firm grip on his seat since 1962. When he steps down, he  will leave a praiseworthy legacy of more jobs, better education and greater  equal opportunity. His early decision not to run again gives black leaders --  veterans and newcomers -- a chance to recharge the political debate in their  community because, finally, there is something to recharge for.  </P></p>

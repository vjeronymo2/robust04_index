			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Markets: No business like show business - London Markets WHEN GRANADA Television bids for a new TV franchise on Wednesday, it will presumably promise a new soap opera: Golden Square. Cue music] Roll Titles] Shot One: Exterior, Day. Pan nondescript West-End square, zoom in to tarnished brass plate reading 'Granada Group. Chief Executive: Derek Lewis'. As we watch, a sign-writer paints out the second line . . . Voice over: 'Golden Square] An everyday story of working people and their non-executive directors]' Synopsis: In the pilot episode, Sidney's nephew Alex is forced to face up to problems at the family firm. Derek, his youthful protege, is knifed by publisher Peter, and by Siegmund's successors at the firm's merchant bank. Meanwhile, in space, a satellite bleeps plaintively . . . Worries that the new TV era will squeeze programme budgets are clearly wrong. Golden Square, at least, is clearly in the Brideshead Revisited class. The backers - Granada Group's shareholders - were asked on Friday to stump up Pounds 163m in a rights issue; they were told their dividends were being cut by 40 per cent; and the group's profitable bingo operations are being sold at a price which - to judge from stock market reaction - gives the purchaser, Bass, a bargain. Granada's share price, which was 396p as recently as two years ago, fell as low as 134p in October 1990. It closed a week ago at 203 1/2 . After reports over the weekend that Derek Lewis, the chief executive, was on his way out, the stock recovered a bit in the early part of this week, trading around 210p. You might have thought that all the bad news was in the price. But the art of soap opera writing is to create moments of horror and fear out of the most predictable events. On this score, Granada proved its artistic credentials once again. It had artfully held back the news of the dividend cut for dramatic effect. On Friday, when the news finally broke, the share price promptly dropped 13 per cent, from 211p to 184p, and closed the week there. Coming soon: the search for a new boss; and the rival bids for the north-west TV franchise, due next week. In Granada's Coronation Street, action used to take place against a stream of murmured complaints from Ena Sharples, a formidable old battle-axe. This week's market developments have also been accompanied by steady grumbling from an old lady in the corner, without anyone paying attention. Unwisely, because the elderly person cradling a bad-tempered milk stout has been the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street herself. On Tuesday, the government rejected the Bank of England's plea for legislation to sort out the the local authority swaps mess; and on Thursday the markets paid not much more attention to a trenchant speech from Robin Leigh-Pemberton about the dangers of too relaxed an approach to inflation. Both the government and the markets may come to regret this week's inattention, the markets in particular. The Governor's underlying message was blunt: do not think that the drop in next Friday's monthly retail price index figures is by itself a reason for easing monetary policy. Since the market had been expecting the publication of those figures to be the occasion for another half-point cut in bank base rates, the speech was potentially unsettling. Either Leigh-Pemberton was signalling that there would be no cut; or he was hinting it might be unwise. Either way, the market's pleasure in anticipating the cut was at risk. The speech was overshadowed, however, by Nationwide Anglia's decision to cut its mortgage lending rates in anticipation of the very drop in interest rates Leigh-Pemberton was hinting against. And the Governor's warnings were backed up by Bank of England efforts throughout the week to prop up short-term interest rates. On Friday, indeed, the Bank lent Pounds 965m to the money market at a 12 per cent interest rate for 14 days - the clearest possible signal, dealers said, that there would be no base-rate cut next week. The money market continued to discount an imminent cut, however. Similarly, on Friday morning the FT-SE 100 index came within a half a point of its 2,555.3 intra-day record, briefly touching 2,554.9. It dropped back later, to at 2,524.3, down 17.5 on the day and up 1.6 on the week. Those murmurs from the corner contributed to lingering unease throughout the week, however. As the chart show, 'retail' equity volume  - UK transactions excluding those between market-makers - has dropped below the industry's Pounds 1bn break-even level. The market's edginess was also fed by renewed warnings from company chairmen. GKN, the engineering group, warned that profits for the first half of the year would be well below the depressed levels of the second half of 1990. The shares closed the week at 341p, down 12p from the previous Friday. Sears, the retailer, announced a sharp drop in 1990 profits, holding the dividend but putting a 'health warning' over future payouts. It said it had seen no upturn in business yet. The shares closed the week at 89p, down  1/2 p. And a final cause of uneasiness was the performance of Wall Street. Although New York's strength on Thursday night sparked Friday morning's rally in London, the feeling was growing in the City that Wall Street is definitely overvalued - and that if New York retreats sharply, London will suffer too. Whatever the uneasiness, investors continued to absorb paper. Morgan Crucible's rights issue was 89 per cent subscribed, which given the company's circumstances was a good uptake. The placing of nearly 5 per cent of Saatchi and Saatchi by Lord Rothschild's St James Place Capital, went smoothly and left the price unchanged. And on Friday MGN's UK offer for sale was announced to be 1.07 times subscribed - practical proof of another old show business principle: always leave 'em asking for more.</p>

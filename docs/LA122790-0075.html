			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WILSON NAMES EX-SIERRA CLUB HEAD TO RUN RESOURCES AGENCY;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: DOUGLAS WHEELER PROMISES TO STRESS COMPROMISE BETWEEN  CONSERVATIONISTS AND BUSINESSES. ACTIVISTS GENERALLY ARE PLEASED WITH HIS  SELECTION.  </P> <P> Gov.-elect Pete Wilson on Wednesday named as his secretary of resources a  former Sierra Club director who pledged to aggressively mediate disputes  between the environmental movement and the business community.  </P> <P> Douglas P. Wheeler, currently executive vice president of the World Wildlife  Fund and Conservation Foundation, said he intends to be a "responsible  activist" who will strive to include all points of view in the Administration's  decision-making process.  </P> <P> "It's been my experience that you make more progress, achieve more  conservation, through cooperation than through confrontation," Wheeler said at  a news conference with Wilson. "We need to adopt pragmatic and inclusive  approaches if we're going to solve these polarized issues."  </P> <P> Wilson, who during last fall's election opposed Propositions 128 and 130, known  as "Big Green" and "Forests Forever" by their supporters, said he believes  voters in rejecting both measures demonstrated that they do not want "radical  environmental change" but seek instead to protect the state's natural resources  without grinding the economy to a halt.  </P> <P> He said that the centrist philosophy of Wheeler, a Republican, will "assure  that both board chairmen and backpackers believe California is a state worth  living and working in."  </P> <P> Wilson declined to say how the Resources Agency would be affected by his  proposed creation of a California Environmental Protection Agency, which would  require reorganization of at least two Cabinet-level agencies.  </P> <P> The resources secretary currently oversees the Coastal Commission and the  departments of Fish and Game, Water Resources and Forestry, among others. The  environmental affairs secretary, whom Wilson has yet to name, supervises three  semi-independent commissions that regulate air and water quality and waste  management.  </P> <P> A 48-year-old native of Brooklyn, N.Y., Wheeler from 1972 to 1977 was a deputy  assistant secretary of the Interior under Presidents Richard M. Nixon and  Gerald R. Ford. In 1980 he founded the American Farmland Trust, a nationwide  nonprofit group dedicated to preserving agricultural land in the face of rapid  suburban development.  </P> <P> He was executive director of the Sierra Club from 1985 until 1987, when he left  to become an executive at the Washington-based Conservation Foundation, the  same environmental organization that produced William K. Reilly, administrator  of the federal Environmental Protection Agency.  </P> <P> Wheeler left the Sierra Club amid friction with the group's volunteer activists  and board members, many of whom disliked his management style. Wheeler was said  to be too much an advocate of centralized control in an organization that  historically was run from the bottom up with a great deal of involvement by  grass-roots volunteers.  </P> <P> Still, Sierra Club leaders and other environmentalists applauded his  appointment Wednesday, even while expressing some unease about Wheeler's  willingness to compromise with the business community.  </P> <P> Bob Hattoy, Southern California director for the Sierra Club, said Wheeler can  pursue a "winning combination" of working with Republicans and grass-roots  environmentalists at the same time.  </P> <P> "Doug makes environmentalists a little nervous because he's such a corporate  kind of guy, and he makes Republicans a little nervous because he's such an  environmentalist," Hattoy said. "It makes a good bridge."  </P> <P> Considering that most environmental organizations endorsed Wilson's opponent,  Democrat Dianne Feinstein, leaders in the movement said they could find little  to quibble with in the governor-elect's selection.  </P> <P> "John Muir isn't governor of California; Pete Wilson is," said Denis Hayes, who  was coordinator of the first Earth Day in 1970 and now directs Green Seal Inc.,  a nonprofit program that certifies commercial products as environmentally  sound. "I think his interests are Wilson's interests."  </P> <P> Throughout his career, Wheeler has demonstrated a knack for working with -- and  sometimes criticizing -- all sides on tough issues, while taking the middle  road himself.  </P> <P> "He's not going to be outspoken; he won't be an aggressive leader taking  unorthodox stands," said Patricia Schifferle, a former Wilderness Society  California representative and now a private environmental consultant. "But I  think his past record demonstrates he has been willing to stand up for  environmental protection."  </P> <P> During the 1988 election campaign, Wheeler wrote an article for the Washington  Post in which he rapped former President Ronald Reagan for appointing  "insensitive" and "incompetent" environmental administrators. But in the same  piece, Wheeler criticized the Sierra Club for being too rigidly partisan in its  support for Democratic candidates, noting that the club objected when Wilson,  then running for reelection to the Senate, used positive letters from the  organization in his campaign commercials.  </P> <P> Wilson praised his nominee for understanding what needs to be done to  "harmonize" environmental quality and economic development. He said recent  history in the Legislature proves that partisan confrontation only produces  stalemate.  </P> <P> "The hard lesson many interest groups have learned is that it is perhaps better  to see if there isn't some rational and perfectly legitimate way to accommodate  one another (rather) than continue this rather unproductive warfare that leads  to no progress for either side," Wilson said.  </P></p>

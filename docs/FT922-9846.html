			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Russia and Japan to draft treaty Russian and Japanese officials are to draft a peace treaty to end formally a state of war which has existed between them since the second world war, Reuter reports from Moscow. Interfax news agency said yesterday working parties from Russia and Japan had been told to draft the peace treaty before Russian President Boris Yeltsin visited Japan in September. A long-running dispute about the ownership of the four most southerly islands in the Kurile chain off Japan's northern tip has prevented Russia and Japan concluding a peace treaty.</p>

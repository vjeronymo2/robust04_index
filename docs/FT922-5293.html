			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Survey of Spain (5): The hesitant tendency - Trade unions drift uneasily into a showdown with Madrid perhaps the next 12 weeks - are going to be extremely testing for Spain's two big trades unions, the socialist General Workers Union (UGT) and the communist Workers' Commissions (CCOO). Both have pronounced the economic convergence plan presented to the country by the Government in April, and its steep cuts in unemployment benefits, as the worst attack ever by a democratic Spanish government on the country's work force. Both promised to respond with all their might. A series of nationwide stoppages, in late May and in October, now threaten the country's 1992 celebrations. Nevertheless, the unions have been strangely divided about their reaction to the Plan, and especially the cuts in unemployment benefit which are central to it. Mr Nicolas Redondo, the ageing UGT leader and Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez's political godfather in the 1970s, has been so outraged by the plans that he moved well beyond the normally more radical CCOO, and was first to call for a general strike. Only weeks after the decree implementing the benefits were published he and the CCCO leadership able to agree on a time table for union action. Their initial inability to say the same thing in the face of the same threat was a telling reminder of how cleverly the Government has begun to spot weaknesses in what was assumed to be a solid trade union front. The UGT and the CCOO combined very effectively to organise a one day general strike in December 1988 against government employment policies. A long drama is being played out here. After Franco's death the unions managed to win, in spite of relatively small memberships, a role in the way Spain constructed its new democracy. They had, after all, been brutally treated under the dictatorship and were regarded in the late 1970s as one of the three 'social partners' (along with business and government) essential to the smooth running of a consensual democracy. This was especially true for the UGT, which was founded by the now ruling socialist party almost a century earlier. When the socialists came to power the UGT effectively did too. All socialist MPs were automatically UGT members. Inevitably, this relationship broke down. Under prime minister Felipe Gonzalez, economic policy has drifted well to the right and annual three-way wage negotiations between the social partners became increasingly difficult to sustain and were last held six years ago. The Government's decision to enter the EC imposed new modernising priorities on economic policy and few people were surprised when the Socialists and the UGT formally split three years ago. It was then, on December 14, 1988, that the unions seemed to have won the upper hand by calling a highly successful one day general strike that paralysed the country. But time has radically narrowed the union's chances of success. Firstly, it was always obvious that the 1988 strike was successful mainly because people simply decided to take the day off work rather than try to reach their offices. Now, too, the Government has made it clear it has no intention of negotiating the convergence plan with the unions. That means they will not be able to draw Madrid into a public debate outside the Government's control (as was the case in 1988 over a youth employment scheme that triggered the strike). It means both the UGT and the CCOO are sparring with an opponent who refuses to come out of his corner. The public is not yet outraged and the widely varying action time scales of the two leaders are a sharp contrast with the unity they developed in 1988. The Government has been extremely clever. Without debate the public only hear the complaints of union officials. These never get on to the public public television and radio channels, however, and even the biggest opposition newspaper, the conservative ABC, has been strangely muted on the issue. That is because the conserva tive opposition, the Partido Popular, has, with its keen nose for opportunity, rushed to embrace the unions and promised to fight the convergence plan with them while the main business confederation, the CEOE, thinks the plan is just what Spain needs. The CEOE carries considerable clout in ABC. It leaves the unions with probably only one effective voice in the media, the already stridently critical newspaper El Mundo, to champion opposition to the convergence plan. El Mundo is extremely critical about everything the Government does and it is hard to imagine how it could become noticeably more so now. No-one in Madrid, in or out of Government, is suggesting the unions will not be able to mount loud and perhaps disruptive protests against the convergence plan but few peo ple seem to be worried that action could be sustained for very long. Certainly, the government seems to have built the probability of strike action into its planning of the convergence programme but it feels it has the unions in a weak position. As any strikes will not be about pay, the public's sympathy might be harder to mobilise. Less than 15 per cent of the Spanish workforce is unionised anyway and Madrid seems to have got away with another divisive tactic earlier this year. This was its refusal to negotiate a difficult round of job and capacity cuts in industries owned or controlled by the state on a sectoral basis. Instead, they are being implemented on a company by company basis, robbing the unions of large platforms upon which to co-ordinate their responses. Gradually, the Government may be winning a battle to remove the unions from the post-Franco pedestal upon which they were placed. The effort is to reduce them to mere bargainers for wages and conditions with the people who directly employ them.</p>

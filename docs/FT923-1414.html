			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Brake Bros edges ahead to Pounds 7.12m SHARES OF Brake Bros yesterday rose 21p to 370p as the supplier of frozen foods to the catering trade announced pre-tax profits up 2.5 per cent to Pounds 7.12m in the first half of 1992. The advance was struck on turnover ahead 22 per cent, from Pounds 103.5m to Pounds 126.4m. Mr Frank Brake, managing director, said that the margin slippage derived mainly from recent acquisitions - Midfish, WH Hooper, Everfresh and London Larder - which contributed about Pounds 13m to the turnover increase but little to profits. Mr Brake said that Everfresh and London Larder, which had taken the group into chilled foods, had contributed about Pounds 7m to turnover. So long as the more complex and regulated handling can be overcome, he said, margins in chilled foods should be higher than in frozen. Since the UK acquisitions, Brake has spent a little over Pounds 4m on two French frozen foods companies in March and August - its first venture across the Channel. Mr Brake said that it was the group's policy to understand that market and expand the operation first, before moving into other territories. Acquisitions, Mr Brake said, were financed by cash resources and borrowings. The latter rose from Pounds 2m to Pounds 6m giving gearing of 15 per cent. Net interest charges rose to Pounds 563,000 (Pounds 259,000). During the half, the group spent Pounds 4.2m on new cold stores and distribution facilities in Somerset, which started operations in July, and Hertfordshire, opening in the autumn. Some Pounds 1.4m went on the motor fleet, Pounds 1.3m on the development of food processing facilities, and Pounds 700,000 on a satellite depot in Bodmin, Cornwall. In all, capital expenditure totalled Pounds 9.1m. Operating profits increased some 7 per cent to Pounds 7.68m (Pounds 7.21m). To partially redress the balance between the interim and final dividends, the former is lifted 12 per cent to 1.85p (1.65p), payable from earnings of 10.3p (10.1p) per share. COMMENT Underlying sales growth of about 10 per cent suggests that Brake is picking up market share, possibly from some of the smaller operators which are finding things hard in a tough market made yet tougher by recent barrages of new safety regulations post-Currie. It has performed well against the market. Its diversification appears prudent and unhurried: in chilled foods, it has taken a careful approach, waiting for the expected higher margins to come through; and in France much the same story. Forecasts for the full year range from Pounds 16m to Pounds 16.3m, giving earnings of between 23.3p and 23.8p and multiples of 15.5 to 15.8. If the market has moved away from recovery plays and the earlier fall in its share price was overplayed, then the shares are looking cheap. However, as a defensive stock and compared with the grocery multiples, they look dear.</p>

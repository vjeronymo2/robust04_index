			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [SEGODNYA report under the "Peninsula" rubric followed by </F> Viktor Yadukha report from Simferopol with the general heading:  "Russian, Ukrainian Heads of Government Wait for Yevgeniy  Saburov. Russia Ready To Discuss Crimean Issue at the UN"]    [Text] Russia's head of government, Viktor Chernomyrdin,  and his first deputy, Oleg Soskovets, proposed to Ukrainian  acting Prime Minister Yefim Zvyagilskiy that talks on the Black  Sea Fleet and the status of Crimea be continued today. Earlier  it was expected that the talks would end on Monday [23 May].  However, according to information received by SEGODNYA, the  need arose during the meeting for Crimean Deputy Prime Minister  Yevgeniy Saburov to attend the talks; yesterday afternoon he  flew to Moscow.    On Monday, Mr. Chernomyrdin suggested during the meeting  that  his Ukrainian counterpart himself outline the range of problems  to be discussed. Yefim Zvyagilskiy named as two priority  matters the split of the Black Sea Fleet and the basing of the  Russian part of the fleet. The official talks were preceded by  a one-hour private meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian  prime ministers.    Russia "does not object" to a consideration of the Crimean  issue by the United Nations, Galina Sidorova, political adviser  to the Russian Foreign Minister, said after Mr. Kozyrev's  meeting with his British counterpart, Douglas Hurd. Meanwhile,  presidential chief of staff Sergey Filatov told ITAR-TASS that  "the ratcheting up of tensions in Crimea is advantageous only to  irresponsible politicians in Ukraine who would like to exploit  an emergency situation in the region to postpone presidential  elections and to hold on to power."  <H8>  * * * </H8>   Yevgeniy Saburov, deputy prime minister of the Republic of  Crimea, said in a conversation with your SEGODNYA correspondent  that at a time of inflation Kiev has given "yet another batch of  newly printed money" to all regions except Crimea. This amounts  to an economic blockade, which began after they stopped giving  credits for the peninsula's agriculture. "It seems natural to  us that Russia, not an overseas power, should assume the  function of a mediator," he emphasized.    In the meantime, a pro-Kiev organization, the Civil Council  of Crimea, which calls itself an opposition parliament, held a  constituent conference in Crimea while talks were under way in  Russia. The council's constituent documents say that "groups of  citizens will select persons loyal to Ukraine from among members  of political organizations." The opposition parliament plans  "to counter separatism and to take efforts to protect and uphold  the status of Crimea as part of Ukraine."</p>

			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Decline in housing index slows HOUSE PRICES fell in February for the fourth successive month, the latest index published by Nationwide Building Society shows. But the fact that February's decline was only 0.2 per cent has kindled hopes of a recovery. In each of the previous three months house prices fell by well over 1 percentage point, and prices have fallen in nine of the past 12 months. Mr David Gilchrist, general manager of Halifax Building Society, the largest UK mortgage lender, said the figures suggested that the housing market might have bottomed out after three years. 'We think that the market is on the turn and this should be clearly seen this spring,' he added. Mr Peter Munday, Nationwide's divisional director, said: 'March is traditionally a busy time in the housing market, and early in the month we were seeing strong signs of increased activity.' But he added that many people might be delaying buying until after the election. Last month's slight fall compares with an 0.7 per cent rise in house prices in March last year. The average UK house price now stands at Pounds 55,193, 4.9 per cent lower than a year ago.</p>

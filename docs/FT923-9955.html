			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Mideast talks back on course WASHINGTON and Moscow have invited participants in the Middle East peace talks to resume bilateral negotiations in the US capital on August 24, the first meeting since the change of government in Israel last month. Hopes of a breakthrough in the talks launched last October, have been raised by the election victory of Mr Yitzhak Rabin, who has promised to accelerate the process. He has accepted having the next round in Washington, which the previous government had rejected, and is prepared to make greater concessions to the Arabs than Mr Yitzhak Shamir, his predecessor. In a rare interview with an Israeli newspaper published yesterday, Mr Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Tunis-based Palestine Liberation Organisation, called on Mr Rabin to drop Israel's refusal to negotiate directly with the PLO in the talks. Mr Arafat also reiterated the Palestinian demand to introduce into the negotiating process the issue of the right of Palestinian refugees to return to their original homes.</p>

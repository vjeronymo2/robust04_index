			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Letter: Prosperity must be earned, and interest rates used realistically Sir, In an otherwise commendable editorial 'A New policy framework' (October 22) there is evidence of a continuing reluctance to view the efficacy of interest rate changes with consistency or realism. What the experience of the period from late-1988 to mid-1990 illustrated clearly was that interest rate changes have a very slow impact upon inflation. Yet you speak of raising interest rates should wage inflation cease its decline. Again, it is stated that rate increases could be needed within the new strategy should sterling collapse. But would not an absence of credibility, initially at least, in the new strategy neutralise the effectiveness of such manoeuvres? I do not believe in any case that under the general strategy as espoused the problem would necessarily be one of need to raise interest rates. Rather that the resultant improvement in the British economy would lead to a strong appreciation of sterling against the currencies of the (declining) European countries by 1993, bringing with it the conflict of whether to use base rates to control domestic inflationary pressures, or to prevent any further increase in the exchange rate, the former requiring (arguably) higher interest rates, the latter rate reductions.

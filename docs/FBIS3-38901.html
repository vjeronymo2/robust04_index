			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Advantages and Risks of Peace Partnership"] </F>   [Text] Having just drafted its proposal for a so-called  peace partnership, the NATO Western alliance has set matters  swiftly in motion. Agreements are also being offered to  traditionally neutral countries like Sweden and Finland, in  addition to those East European countries that want membership  in the alliance. Russia too has received an invitation, and it  is in principle favorably disposed to it.    NATO has its own grounds for regarding the participation of  countries like Finland and Sweden as desirable. Then too, broad  participation will reduce the former East bloc countries' fear  that partnership is only a polite way of leaving them to fend  for themselves.    Finland has to carefully consider its own advantage. A  partnership arrangement with NATO is not a first-class security  policy issue for us. If we take the right action, we can derive  a modest benefit from it, but one worth aiming for. If we act  clumsily, we will end up a member of the wrong group in the  wrong context.    Before the end of last year, the government was still  vacillating to a great extent, but now it seems to be making up  its mind. The government Foreign Affairs Committee said on  Wednesday [19 January] that it in principle takes a positive  view of the goals of this partnership since the NATO initiative  is aimed at stabilizing conditions in Europe, not creating new  dividing lines.    A report is now being drafted on the matter. Cooperation,  especially with Sweden, is considered to be important, and our  own contribution is seen as lying primarily in peacekeeping, an  area in which Finland has experience. According to the  committee, Finland is not interested in military cooperation  proper.    Whether partnership is a NATO waiting room for the East  European countries or not, Finland's proper place is clearly not  on the same bench. Finland's current interests do not lie in any  military alliance, but in the European Union (EU) membership for  which we have applied. The EU will also be the first and most  natural frame of reference of our future cooperation on security  policy.    However, the mere idea of a "peace partnership" need not  frighten people. After all, the term itself is a typical product  of the military policy poster paint shop, bland and without  content. Nevertheless, if Russia and most of the former  socialist countries agree on their own arrangments and if our  neighbor, Sweden, is also interested, it will be worth Finland's  while to be among them, if only because of their discussion  contacts and the publicity that NATO meetings bring with them.    The wisest thing for us to do is to bear in mind that haste  makes waste and be selective about choosing those forms of  cooperation that are suitable for us in particular. Peacekeeping  is a very appropriate area even if the whole way it operates has  to be reconsidered following the painful experiences of the  Balkans and Somalia. If the network of partnership agreements in  time achieves an improvement in the flow of information and  understanding across Europe's old dividing lines, so much the  better.    The idea of a peace partnership arose in NATO when the East  European countries wanted security guarantees from that  organization that it could not provide. The initiative is as as  far as NATO's unity and political determination will go at the  present time. The East European countries will have to be  content with it. Partnership promises Finland a new form of  cooperation that is not very central, but which will  nevertheless make it possible for us to attain some limited  advantages.</p>

			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Dream scenario fades: Mildly disappointing economic data It was all looking too good to be true - until this week. Britain had seemed to be experiencing a near perfect economic recovery in recent months. Falling unemployment, manufacturing output bounding ahead, soaring productivity, a steady increase in consumer demand, robust exports and unexpectedly low price rises combined to foster the belief that the UK might be on course to achieving that holy grail of policymakers: sustained non-inflationary growth. Now, after a week of mildly disappointing official statistics, is not the time to consign the recovery to the dustbin. But the news that manufacturing output is growing by about 2 per cent rather than 3 per cent a year, and that seasonally adjusted unemployment has risen by 10,000 over the past two months after five consecutive months of decline, has brought the pundits back to earth. Sceptical Treasury officials had worried quietly that the 'dream scenario' of the recent past did not add up. With continental Europe in what may be its worst recession since the second world war, and an overhang in Britain of personal debt and negative equity in the housing market, it always looked more likely that recovery would be hesitant and patchy. That now seems to be the case. This week's news that retail prices rose by 1.7 per cent in the year to August (compared with 1.2 per cent in June, when the annual 'headline' inflation rate appears to have bottomed out) will make it more difficult for the government to achieve its goal of a freeze on public sector pay bills. But the fact that inflation is creeping upwards, together with evidence of a less buoyant recovery, makes economy-wide pay restraint more essential for future economic welfare. Downward revisions to the industrial production figures over the first half of this year have led to a reappraisal of productivity and unit labour costs. In mid-August, Department of Employment figures had suggested that Britain might be enjoying a productivity miracle. The government reported that output per head in manufacturing increased by 10.5 per cent in May compared with the year before. With 9.5 per cent year-on-year growth, May's revised productivity figure still looks good. But annual growth of manufacturing output per head in June and July has been less spectacular: at 5.1 and 5.5 per cent respectively. The latest unit labour cost developments put the competitiveness of British business in a less flattering light. Official government figures in August showed that wages and salaries per unit of output fell by 5.3 per cent in the year to May. That decline was revised to 4.4 per cent this week, when the Department of Employment also reported sharply lower falls in unit labour costs in manufacturing industry, of 0.4 per cent and 0.6 per cent in the 12 months to June and July respectively. These figures cover only manufacturing, which is less than a quarter of the economy, and they are liable to revision. Provisional productivity and unit wage cost figures for the whole economy in the first half of this year are due to be released next week. But the statistics strongly suggest that the annual growth of average earnings at its present historically low rate of 3.5 per cent offers no grounds for complacency. In particular, from the government's viewpoint, the present 5 per cent annual increase in underlying earnings in manufacturing is too high for comfort: it does little for the competitiveness of British industry and undermines the case for public sector pay restraint.</p>

			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Levy withdraws threat to leave Israeli government A FRAGILE unity was restored to Israel's ruling right-wing Likud party yesterday when Mr David Levy, the foreign minister, withdrew at the last minute a threat to resign from the government that had exposed deep divisions in the Likud less than three months before a general election. Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the prime minister, broke the deadlock after a week of crisis by agreeing to grant most of Mr Levy's demands. The two men met an hour before the weekly cabinet session at which the foreign minister had said he would tender his resignation. Although reluctant to give ground, Mr Shamir clearly decided the continuation of the row with Mr Levy risked fatal damage for the party in the election campaign against a resurgent Labour opposition. In a signed agreement with Mr Levy, Mr Shamir agreed to grant the foreign minister's supporters increased representation both in Likud internal institutions and in government appointments. Mr Levy himself was guaranteed his post as foreign minister in any Likud-led government and allowed to nominate another minister. The agreement formalised Mr Levy's standing in the party, which he felt had been undermined. It met his complaint that his supporters - mainly from Israel's Sephardi, or Oriental Jewish, community - had been conspired against in recent party internal elections by Mr Shamir and his Ashkenazi, or European allies, Mr Moshe Arens, the defence minister, and Mr Ariel Sharon, the housing minister. Both sides tried to play down the ethnic element. But it was clear that it had put at risk the Likud's traditional supremacy among the majority Sephardim, many of whose leaders have recently sharply criticised Mr Shamir's leadership. Mr Levy immediately pledged to work to unite the party 'in order to heal the wound'. But the electorate may not be convinced by the sudden switch from furious feud to bland brotherhood.</p>

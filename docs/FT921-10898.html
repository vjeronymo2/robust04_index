			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Too much hot air being talked over nitrogen threat - It is clear that most of the fear of nitrate levels present in public water supplies is based on emotion rather than science ABOUT 1.6m tonnes of nitrate fertiliser is applied to UK farm crops each year. Research has shown that were this artificial fertiliser not used, yields of some of those crops would be halved. Such is the influence of nitrogen on production and therefore on profits and, somewhat predictably, applications of nitrates to farmland have increased significantly over the last 50 or so years since economic methods to produce them were perfected. However it has also been established that between 10 per cent and 60 per cent of this fertiliser may not be taken up by the crops on which it is spread, implying a possible wastage and more seriously, leakage, of nitrate through the soil into water supplies. It is this so-called leaching that exercises the environmental groups that allege that higher levels of nitrates in water supplies are leading to dangers to health and degradation of the environment. But is the situation as serious as they suggest and is agriculture entirely to blame? As the subject, Farming, Fertilisers and the Nitrate Problem, points out there is no conclusive proof for any of the allegations. Indeed there is an old and well worn correlation the authors say, between the number of bottles of whisky sold around the turn of the century and the number of clergymen in England and Wales at the same time. But that does not prove that the men of the cloth were drunkards. A far more likely explanation, they suggest, is that the distilleries expanded to serve the needs of a growing population, as did the church. In other words the growth in population and industry, with their wastes and sewage, are partly responsible for the undoubted increase in nitrate content in our water. And while agriculture must accept its share of the blame it has by the use of nitrates over a 50 year period increased UK self-sufficiency for food from 30 per cent to 70 per cent while the population has itself increased from 35m to 55m. Some might say that a marginal increase in nitrates in British water supplies is a small price to pay for such a desirable economic achievement. Others would argue, of course, that if it meant endangering the lives of British citizens, including unborn babies, it was too high a price. But are these real dangers or are they imagined? It is widely perceived that high nitrates in water cause stomach cancer and blue babies and there seems little doubt that very high levels, accompanied by bacteriological contamination, may cause such problems. As is reported in Farming, Fertilisers and the Nitrate Problem, however, the last documented death of a blue baby in the UK was in 1950, when microbial infection, probably resulting from the use of excreta-contaminated well water, caused the chemical suffocation of a baby. The last blue baby case in Britain was in 1972 and fortunately that baby survived. There have been no known cases associated with public water supplies. The emotive association of water-borne nitrate with cancer is equally difficult to substantiate. Moreover a well-documented study conducted between 1969 and 1973, comparing the incidence of stomach cancer in so-called high risk areas, the public water supply had high nitrate levels, others where it was low, revealed that there were less stomach cancers in the high nitrate areas. It is clear therefore that most of the fear of nitrates levels currently present in public water supplies is based on emotion rather than science. Nevertheless, the UK government agreed to a European Community directive more than a decade ago committing itself to ensuring that all water supplies in this country would contain less than 50 parts per million of nitrates by 1985, compared with the 100 ppm standard it previously imposed. It failed to do so and when EC inspectors discovered last year that some UK water supplies still had higher levels of nitrate (between 50 and 100 ppm - the World Health Organisation still says that up to 100 ppm is quite safe) they decide to condemn Britain for failing to comply with the directive, causing the government embarrassment and Friends of the Earth and other environment groups much satisfaction. In an attempt to respond to EC pressure, in 1990 the Ministry of Agriculture identified some of the areas where nitrate leaching from farmland appeared to be most significant and designated a series of 10 small 'nitrate sensitive areas'. These, it said, were to test agronomic systems which might reduce the leaching. Participation by farmers in limiting fertiliser applications and modifying techniques is voluntary and compensation for loss of income averaging about Pounds 75 per hectare per year is paid by the government. Meanwhile the EC has moved on. It has now issued a new nitrate directive that requires all member states to identify, by December 1993, 'vulnerable zones' - all areas where there is a possibility that farming may contribute to what it describes as a deterioration of water quality - and to impose restrictions on farming in those areas over the course of the next six years. The areas concerned represent much of the most productive land in the country. It has in fact been estimated that up to 2m hectares (5m acres) of UK land might be affected. That equates approximately to 5 counties the size of Norfolk and the farmers in those areas, most of which would be in East Anglia, would be required to comply with similar yield-inhibiting regulations to those in the experimental nitrates sensitive areas. Up to now there has been no mention of compensation to farmers for loss of income. Indeed the cost to taxpayers, if it came anywhere near to covering the loss, would be so massive as to make it prohibitive. It seems to UK farmers therefore that once again they may be penalised by the bureaucratic bulldozer that is Brussels for reasons of politics and the reduction of surpluses rather than because of any real dangers their use of fertilisers may pose. Statistics prove that for economic and environmental reasons UK farmers have, in any case, reduced their use of artificial nitrogen over the last 5 years. Furthermore they find it somewhat ironic that the same EC that seeks to cut the leakage of nitrates into water supplies advocates the expansion of organic farming. For any soil scientist will tell you that organic nitrogen is the leakiest of all. Farming, Fertilisers and the Nitrate Problem, by TM Addiscott, AP Whitmore and DS Powlson.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "Around the Clock Nonstop" </F> rubric: "Ukraine Defense Ministry Urged To Pay Bills"]    [Text] We have come to learn from competent sources in  Sevastopol that the Black Sea Fleet command sent a cable  yesterday to General of the Army Vitaliy Radetskyy, Ukraine  defense minister.    It says that, as of 28 March 1994, the debt of the Ukrainian  military units that use electric power through military units of  the Black Sea Fleet amounts to 4 billion karbovanets. As for  the debt run up by customers subordinated to Ukraine's Defense  Ministry to the construction department of the Black Sea Fleet,  it is as high as 16.709 trillion karbovanets.    The Black Sea Fleet Command believes that this situation is  evidence of the Ukraine Defense Ministry's having violated the  understanding reached between the two republics at the  presidential level on joint financing of the Black Sea Fleet.  In essence, the Ukrainian military is solving its own problems  at the expense of the Russian Navy.    Unless the Defense Ministry pays up the debt to the Black  Sea  Fleet before 10 April, the Black Sea Fleet command will halt the  construction and assembly work being done for Ukraine's Defense  Ministry, and make all Ukrainian military units use their own  power resources, the cable says.</p>

			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets: Paris braces itself for flurry of equity issues - But unless interest rates fall, the market may remain inactive until the autumn Parisians poured out of the city on Wednesday night to fait le pont for a long Ascension weekend, and their stock market settled down to slumber through the long, hot summer months. The CAC 40 index, which rose rapidly in early spring, has been distinctly dull this month. This week, it fell further after Tuesday's announcement by Mr Michel Sapin - who recently replaced Mr Pierre Beregovoy as France's finance minister when the latter was appointed prime minister - that official interest rates were unlikely to fall until the Bundesbank took a lead by reducing German rates. The index ended the week at 2,033, still healthily higher than the psychological benchmark of 2,000 but well below its 2,145 high. Unfortunately for French investors, the omens for the summer months are scarcely scintilating. 'It's difficult to be optimistic,' said Mr David Finch, a director of the stockbroking subsidiary of Finacor in Paris. 'The Paris market has had a very strong run over the past few months. A lot of fund managers are now overweight in French stocks. Unless there is a sudden change of heart on interest rates, the market is likely to stay within the 1,960 to 2,100 band until the autumn.' The pedestrian prospects for the Paris market certainly do not reflect any concern about the underlying strength of the economy. France may have experienced a slowdown in growth last year but it has been spared the serious slowdowns - and recessions - that have beset so many of its trading partners. On Tuesday Mr Sapin also announced the first official growth figures for the first quarter of 1992. These were slightly higher than expected at 1.1 per cent compared with the same period last year, and came with an increase in exports of 4.3 per cent. In an interview published in Thursday's edition of Liberation, the finance minister suggested that France may surpass the government's initial estimate of 2 per cent growth for the whole of 1992, possibly achieving growth of around 2.5 per cent. A report by Banque Indosuez in Paris concluded that 'activity can be expected to continue to move positively, but without any great acceleration' for the rest of the year, reflecting moderate growth in consumer spending and a slow increase in industrial investment. The flurry of first quarter sales figures published in the past two or three weeks have echoed this stable, steady scenario. The only exceptions are the cyclical stocks in sectors such as luxury goods, which may be affected by the economic problems of Japan, one of the most important markets for French fashion and fragrances, and construction, still exposed to the general European economic slowdown. LVMH, one of France's largest luxury goods group, saw its shares come under pressure this week after Mr Bernard Arnault, its chairman, issued a cautious statement and some analysts warned that they would have to downgrade their 1992 profit estimates. Eurotunnel was hit by rumours that its failure to reach an agreement with its construction contractors could scupper the whole scheme. This speculation also affected the shares of Bouyges, France's biggest construction company and one of the largest Eurotunnel contractors, after it announced plans for a capital increase on Monday. Meanwhile, the share price of Euro Disney was affected by unconfirmed reports that attendance at the theme park, which opened last month at Marne La Vallee outside Paris, had been lower than expected. Mr Finch of Finacor suspects that such stocks will remain under pressure, but that more mainstream stocks - particularly in consumer-related sectors such as cars - will continue to outperform. Mr David Harrington, French market analyst at James Capel in Paris, has been sufficiently cheered by the stream of first quarter sales figures to stick to his forecast of a 15 to 20 per cent increase in earnings for the CAC 40 companies this year, compared with last year's fall of 7 per cent. Although the outlook seems stable on the corporate front, the progress of the market could be impeded by the stream of proposed new equity issues. The government is the chief instigator, thanks to its partial privatisation programme, which got underway in March with the FFr2.08bn sale of a 2.3 per cent stake in Elf Aquitaine, the oil group. France's other major oil group, Total, is next on the list for partial privatisation. Other state-controlled companies are keen to follow suit. Rhone Poulenc, the chemicals group, has made no secret of its hopes of partial privatisation. The three public sector insurers - Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), Assurances Generales de France (AGF) and Group des Assurances Nationales (GAN) - are also awaiting the final plans for their share sales. Meanwhile, a series of private sector companies have also announced plans to tap the market for capital. Bouyges did so on Monday followed by Alcatel Cable on Tuesday. Lafarge-Coppee, the construction materials company, is rumoured to be considering an issue, as is Michelin. There is no cause for concern about the ability of the market to absorb these issues. Indeed, one of its main problems is a shortage of equity. But the prospect of so many new shares being issued at a time when investors are already overweight certainly sharpens the chances of a sleepy summer for the bourse.</p>

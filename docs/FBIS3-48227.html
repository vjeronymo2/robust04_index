The prediction is based on the facts that Korean  shipbuilders  can undercut Japanese-built ship prices while they can compete  against the Japanese in quality and marketing, according to a  report issued Thursday by the Korea Institute for Industrial  Economy and Trade.    The report said the general technological level of Korean  shipbuilders is below that of the Japanese, but the quality of  products, marketing and after-sales service are almost on a par  with the Japanese.    In price competition, however, Korean yards are far ahead of  the Japanese, offsetting their weak points, it said. Especially  because of the rising value of the yen from last year, their  competitive power has continued to rise.    As a result, Korean shipbuilders are expected to maintain  their edge over their Japanese counterparts as long as the  foreign exchange trend keeps up, it said.    Against Chinese shipbuilders, meanwhile, the Koreans lag  slightly behind in price competitiveness but Korea far outpaces  China in all other aspects including technology, marketing,  financing, after- sales service and marketing, it said.    Compared with European shipyards, it said, Korean  shipbuilders are far ahead. In other aspects, they are either  on a par or slightly ahead of European builders, it added.</p>

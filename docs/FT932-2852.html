			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Japanese fear shift of output to China THE Japan Machinery Exporters' Association yesterday warned its members that they should be careful about investing in China, partly out of concern about legal protection but also because of fears that Japan's domestic industry will be undermined by a shift of production. A survey of 314 of its members revealed that 72 had invested in China or were planning to do so - a trend encouraged by the rise of the yen and by the poor profitability of many manufacturers, who want to cut production costs. Mr Tetsuzo Yamamoto, chief of international research at the association, said the Japanese industry risked becoming 'just a shell' if machinery manufacturers continued to transfer operations to China. The association warned companies to be wary of inadequate legal protection in China, sometimes poor production quality and restrictions on sales to the Chinese domestic market. Japanese trading house Kinsho-Mataichi and shirtmaker Tomiya Apparel are to make shirts in Beijing for export to Japan. Initial annual output of 600,000 shirts is expected to increasing to 1.2m by about 1996.</p>

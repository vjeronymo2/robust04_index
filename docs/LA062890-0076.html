			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: MALIBU;  </P> <P> CITYHOOD APPROVED BY 84%  </P> <P> Official results of the June 5 incorporation election show that Malibu voters  approved cityhood by just under 84%, Los Angeles County election officials  announced this week. The vote was 4,682 to 892.  </P> <P> Walt Keller and Larry Wan were the top vote-getters among the 30 candidates for  Malibu's future City Council. Keller had 3,453 votes and Wan 3,181. The other  three council members and the votes they received were: Mike Caggiano, 2,616;  Carolyn Van Horn, 2,287, and Missy Zeitsoff, 1,912.  </P> <P> The official results showed Zeitsoff as the winner by five votes over retired  Judge John Merrick for the hotly contested fifth council seat. County officials  last week had indicated that, with all the absentee and write-in ballots  accounted for, Zeitsoff had won by four votes.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the official vote count showed voters overwhelmingly approving the  selection of future City Council members at large, rather than by district. The  vote was 3,669 to 1,437.  </P></p>

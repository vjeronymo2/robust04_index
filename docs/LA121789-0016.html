			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY LAW  </P> <P> In his article "Family Law" (Nov. 12), Adam Dawson wrote that a wildcat strike  in Oakland at the turn of the century cost John Byrne his job -- and the long  unemployment turned him into a wastrel and drinking partner of author Jack  London. In turn, Byrne's poverty created a fear of unemployment in the next  generation and a family that headed for dependable public service jobs.  </P> <P> To shed new light on this matter, young Jack London did have the opportunity of  a lifetime job with the post office of the City of Oakland. Because of his  natural writing ability, London forsook the public service job in order to  spend 19 hours per day at his reading, research and the writing of his  world-famous articles and 50 books.  </P> <P> KENNETH LLOYD LARSON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

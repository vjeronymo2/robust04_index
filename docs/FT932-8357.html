			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Elswick near Pounds 2m in black ELSWICK overcame a tough year, particularly in the last four months, to produce a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.91m for the 12 months ended January 31. Reminding shareholders that trading was weighted towards the first half, Mr Bill Cross, chairman, said the second period was constrained by unusually subdued demand in specialised print and packaging, and by particularly adverse weather which led to Pounds 1m of lost sales in equipment and services. Those constraints were not carried over to the current year which had 'started briskly', said Mr Cross. The accounts comply with FRS 3, and 1991-92 now showed a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.54m after a Pounds 1.68m loss on disposal of Falcon Cycles. Print and packaging sales rose 8 per cent to Pounds 28.1m, but operating profit fell to Pounds 2.74m (Pounds 2.81m) after Pounds 150,000 non-recurring expenditure on a new offset litho press. Earnings per share came to 0.78p (losses 0.82p). The final dividend is 0.15p for a total of 0.3p (0.22p). Mr Cross is retiring as chairman on July 22 and will be succeeded by Lord Lane.</p>

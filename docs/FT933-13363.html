			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Troop withdrawal from HK set BRITISH troops will be withdrawn from the Hong Kong garrison by the time Britain hands the colony over to China on July 1 1997, Mr Jeremy Hanley, armed forces minister, announced last night. But he said Army, Royal Navy and RAF units will remain until the day before the change of the rule. Mr Hanley said that in the latter part of next year the 1st Battalion, the Black Watch, will return to the UK and the two Gurkha battalions will merge to form the 1st Battalion the Royal Gurkha Rifles, which will remain in Hong Kong until June 1997.</p>

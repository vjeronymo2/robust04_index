			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: SG Warburg The story of SG Warburg is really a tale of two companies. Mercury Asset Management, in which it has a 75 per cent stake and which contributes nearly half its operating profits, is going from strength to strength. On the other hand, the investment banking business made a return on capital last year of only around 14 per cent despite a sharp improvement in the second half. The temptation must be to bypass Warburg and buy straight into Mercury. Only the possibility that Warburg's share price may not yet have fully discounted a cyclical recovery in investment banking gives ground for second thoughts. Warburg's poor level of disclosure would be deplored by its own star-rated analysts if it was adopted by any other company. There is no detail on costs and no break-down of investment banking revenue. It appears that advisory fees are showing some recovery, but the second half turnround owes more to increased trading activity. Making money from trading is easy when the yield curve is positive. Warburg's bond market losses in the first half are a reminder that its judgment is less than perfect when conditions are difficult. Perhaps its controls are now strong enough to reduce this risk. The acquisition of KC-CO will enhance its skills in derivatives, where the bank has been relatively weak, but if the shares are to offer long-term promise, Warburg must show that it has found a sustainable way of increasing its return.</p>

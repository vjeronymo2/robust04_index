			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets - Copenhagen First-half results are expected on Wednesday for Tele Danmark, the large telecommunications group which came to the market with an IPO in April. Merrill Lynch expects few surprises, but says the interim results should be positive with revenue growth of 5 per cent, operating profits up 10 per cent and pre-tax profits lifted by a restructuring of the balance sheet with the IPO proceeds and reduced pension contributions, up 30 per cent to DKr1.57bn. Danish companies tend not to pay interim dividends, says the broker, and Tele Danmark is no exception.</p>

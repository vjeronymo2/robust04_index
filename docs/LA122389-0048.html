			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PREVIOUS CIPHER TALKS FAILED, ARCHIVE REVEALS  </P> <P> Archive Corp.'s $109-million hostile takeover bid for Cipher Data Products of  San Diego follows two aborted merger attempts between the two rival computer  products manufacturers in 1986 and 1988, the company disclosed Friday.  </P> <P> In documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Costa  Mesa-based Archive revealed that Cipher blames it for backing out of the  earlier merger talks, and that Cipher's chairman has already told Archive that  its current $7.50-a-share offer is inadequate.  </P> <P> Archive has acquired 4.6% of Cipher's stock and Tuesday said it was launching a  tender offer to buy the rest of the company's outstanding shares. Cipher  officials said its board is studying the offer, which expires Jan. 22.  </P> <P> Archive and Cipher are leading manufacturers of tape drives used to copy data  stored on computer hard-disk drives. The two companies are bitter rivals, not  only in the marketplace but in the courtroom, where they are locked in a patent  dispute.  </P> <P> The SEC filing states that Archive Chairman Howard Lewis approached Cipher  management about a possible merger for the first time in May, 1986. The talks  broke down after four months, when the companies could not agree on a purchase  price.  </P> <P> In May, 1988, Lewis and then-Cipher President Gary E. Liebl met to discuss a  settlement of a patent suit between the two companies. During that meeting,  Lewis proposed that Archive purchase Cipher's quarter-inch cartridge tape drive  business and again raised the idea of a merger of the companies. The talks  broke down the following month when, again, the firms couldn't agree on a  price, the filing shows.  </P> <P> On Dec. 13, Lewis approached Cipher for the third time to propose a merger.  According to the filing, Cipher's Liebl told Lewis that "the two companies did  not have a good track record of working together" and that "there had been  promising discussions in the past, but Archive's board of directors had changed  Archive's direction."  </P> <P> At a face-to-face meeting Dec. 15, the SEC filing states, Liebl told Lewis that  the $7.50-a-share proposal was too low and that he doubted Cipher's directors  would support it. Liebl noted that Cipher's book value -- what the company  would be worth if its assets were sold -- was more than $7.50 a share. Analysts  have pegged Cipher's book value at $9 to $10 per share.  </P> <P> According to the filing, Liebl also said he doubted that Archive was serious  about its proposal because "it has backed away from two prior transactions with  the company."  </P> <P> But, on Dec. 19, Lewis sent a letter to Liebl informing him that Archive was  launching a tender offer for Cipher and requesting a meeting to discuss the  offer.  </P></p>

			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Letter: Baccalaureate better than early educational specialisation Sir, A broad-based examination with top grades at A-level or better ('Exam standards', September 3) already exists. The International Baccalaureate offers a demanding but flexible mix of numerate, literate, creative and social subjects with three taken at non-specialist and three at university entrance level. The system is highly developed, valid for a wide range of students and internationally recognised. Why have only a few enlightened schools in the UK adopted the IB? Resistance seems to stem from the universities, or at least the prejudices of some specialists, which are transmitted to the school system. What is wrong with British education (we should say English, for the Scots are better) is not that it fails to reach the highest standards for a few exotic plants in the hothouse, but that it excludes many from discovering their growth potential by excessive early pruning. The IB is an excellent preparation either for further studies or for professional development. I have an architect and a molecular biologist in my own family to prove it. As an executive search consultant, I constantly see evidence that early specialisation is a handicap to be overcome rather than an asset in producing rounded, educated problem-solvers. If British business is to compete globally, it needs engineers who speak Japanese, lawyers with scientific training, finance directors with geo-political sense and politicians who understand what all these people do. Why continue to mess about with half-baked solutions to Britain's examination needs when a tried and tested system could be adopted which would put Britain on a par with the best of international standards? If there are real objections to the IB, I should be interested to hear them. Michael Barrett, managing director, GKR Japan, Landmark Shibakoen Building, Tokyo 105</p>

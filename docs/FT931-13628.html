			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / International Company News: Shuwa adds to Japanese retailers' woes with forced stock selling JAPAN'S retail sector, battered by a sharp downturn in consumer spending and falling profits, suffered a further blow yesterday when Shuwa, the troubled Japanese stock and real estate speculator, was seen as a forced seller of a number of retail share stakes. Shuwa is under pressure to sell its stock holdings in order to reduce borrowings. Reports that Shuwa was selling its stake in leading department stores, Isetan and Matsuzakaya, undermined confidence on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, prompting Matsuzakaya to fall by its daily limit of Y200 or 16.3 per cent to Y1,020 (Dollars 8.16), while Isetan lost 16.8 per cent to Y1,980. During the boom days of the late 1980s, Shuwa accumulated shares in a range of Japanese retailers for the claimed purpose of restructuring the industry. However, the company used several of its share stakes as collateral on loans from a leading supermarket operator, Daiei. Daiei, which now faces its own problems following diversification into credit service, real estate and tourism, is pressuring Shuwa to repay its debts. Shuwa, which has total outstanding debts of Y850bn, is expected to release 17.2 per cent of Matsuzakaya shares next month, raising some Y27bn. Efforts by Shuwa to raise cash through stock sales could trigger consolidation within the industry through an increase in mergers and acquisitions. Shuwa has attempted to sell its 29 per cent stake in Isetan, which has a network of 10 stores in Japan, to Ito-Yokado, which owns Southland, the US operator of the Seven Eleven convenience store chain. Ito-Yokado yesterday said talks over the acquisition of Isetan shares from Shuwa had fallen through, but it was still interested in adding a department store to its group.</p>

The proceeds from the Series C Bonds will be used to refund the County Commission's Series B Pollution Control Revenue Bonds currently outstanding as follows: (i) $11.5 million principal amount of Pollution Control Revenue Bond 6.95% (West Penn Power Company Pleasants Power Station Project), 1978 Series B, maturing August 1, 2003; (ii) $20 million principal amount of Pollution Control Revenue Bonds 7.00% (West Penn Power Company Pleasants Power Station Project), 1978 Series B, maturing August 1, 2008; (iii) $21 million principal amount of Pollution Control Revenue Bonds 7.30% (The Potomac Edison Company Pleasants Power Station Project), 1978 Series B, maturing August 1, 2008; and (iv) $25 million principal amount of Pollution Control Revenue Bonds 7.75% (Monongahela Power Company Pleasants Power Station Project), 1979 Series B, maturing August 1, 2009 (collectively, ``Series B Bonds''). The Series B Bonds were used to provide additional money for the installation of pollution control equipment and facilities (``Facilities'') at Pleasants Power Station in Pleasants County, West Virginia. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Series C Bonds will be issued under a supplemental trust indenture with a corporate trustee, approved by the Companies, and will be sold at such time, at such interest rate and for such price as shall be approved by the Companies. However, the interest rate for each series of Series C Bonds will not exceed the interest rate of the corresponding series of Series B Bonds presently outstanding. Additionally, the Companies state that they will not enter into the proposed refunding transaction unless the estimated present value savings derived from the net difference between interest payments on the new issues of comparable securities and on the securities to be refunded is, on an after tax basis, greater than the present value of all redemption and issuing costs, assuming an appropriate discount rate. The discount rate used shall be the estimated after tax interest rate on the Series C Bonds to be issued. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Concurrently with the issuance of the Series C Bonds, the Companies propose to issue, through December 31, 1995, non-negotiable promissory notes (``Pollution Control Notes'') corresponding to the Series C Bonds in respect of the principal amount, interest rates and redemption provisions (which may include a special right of the holder to require the redemption or repurchase of the holder of the Series C Bond at stated intervals) and having installments of principal corresponding to any mandatory sinking fund payments and stated maturities. The Pollution Control Notes will be substituted for and replace the promissory notes presently outstanding. The outstanding notes will be cancelled. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Pollution Control Notes will be secured by a second lien on the Facilities and certain other properties, pursuant to the Deed of Trust and Security Agreement dated November 1, 1977, as supplemented by a First Supplement thereto dated August 1, 1978 as to West Penn and Potomac Edison and a First Supplemental thereto dated February 1, 1979 as to Monongahela (``Deed''). The security interest in the Facilities and certain other property conveyed by the Deed is subject to the lien securing each Company's first mortgage bonds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Payments on the Pollution Control Notes will be made to the Trustee under supplements to the existing indentures and shall be applied by the Trustee to pay the maturing principal and redemption price of and interest and other costs on the Series C Bonds as the same become due. Each Company also proposes to pay any trustees' fees and expenses incurred by the County Commission. The Companies request an exception from the competitive bidding requirements of rule 50 under subsection (a)(5) thereof in connection with the issuance of the Pollution Control Notes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

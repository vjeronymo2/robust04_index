			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 23 May (XINHUA)--A relevant person in  charge of China's Justice Ministry today pointed out here that  the report distributed by the organizations such as "Human  Rights Watch/Asia" on 19 May, which claimed that nearly 500  prisoners who were arrested during the "4 June" incident have  been recently discovered in Beijing's No. 2 Prison and Qinghe  Reform-Through-Labor Farm and have been mistreated is sheer  rumor with ulterior motives.    The relevant person in charge of the Justice Ministry made  this remark today when responding to a question asked by a  reporter who was conducting an interview in the Justice Ministry  about this issue.    The person in charge said that, during the "4 June" incident  five years ago, criminal proceedings were brought against a  small number of people according to law because they had carried  out activities aimed at overthrowing the government or had  engaged in crimes such as smashing, looting, burning, and  killing. He said that an absolute majority of them have been  released because they have obtained lenient treatment or have  served their terms, and the situation of nearly 500 persons  being imprisoned does not exist. The so-called "new discovery"  by organizations such as "Human Rights Watch/Asia" is nothing  but a new rumor created by them.    This person in charge also said: Regarding the alleged  coercion of prison inmates to be quality control workers for  latex glove exports to the United States, investigations have  found that the Beijing Municipal No 2 Prison signed a contract  with a Beijing factory in 1991 to inspect its latex glove  products. There were express provisions in the contract that  all gloves to be inspected were to be sold domestically, and the  contract has been effectively implemented. There was never any  question about prisoners checking latex gloves which were  exported to the United States, much less one about Beijing  Municipal No 2 Prison producing latex gloves to be exported.    This person in charge pointed out: Chinese prisons,  including the Beijing Municipal No 2 Prison, in accordance with  the law, treat their prisoners humanely. Chinese law expressly  forbids using corporeal punishment or committing brutalities  against prisoners. We conduct business strictly according to the  relevant laws and undertake the civilized management of  prisoners, who are given genuine legal protection. The Chinese  "Penal Code" states that corporeal punishment, the mistreatment  of inmates, and gross infringements of criminals' legitimate  rights and interests are criminal offenses punishable by law.  People's procuratorates at all levels have special prison-based  agencies and staff to monitor the enforcement of these laws.  The statement that the Beijing Municipal No 2 Prison beat,  abused, and used corporeal punishment on prisoners is groundless  and a pure fabrication.    In conclusion, this person-in-charge finally pointed out:  This was not the first time that "Human Rights Watch/Asia" and  other such organizations have concocted hair-raising lies which  they have spread to confuse public opinion. But lies are lies.  Such malicious slander by organizations such as "Human Rights  Watch/Asia" only succeeds in exposing their hostility toward the  Chinese people.</p>

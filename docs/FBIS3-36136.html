			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Pelts: "Russian Federation Defense </F> Minister Arrives in Tbilisi"]    [Text] Tbilisi -- On the eve of the official visit by  Russian President Boris Yeltsin Army General Pavel Grachev,  minister of defense of the Russian Federation, has arrived in  Tbilisi; he will take part in talks at the highest level.    On 2 February the defense minister and officials  accompanying  him visited the Russian Motorized Infantry Regiment. At a  meeting with officers Army General Grachev stressed that the  question of the possibility of setting up Russian military bases  in Georgia will be raised at the talks. The Georgian leadership  on the whole supports this idea and is ready to discuss it. In  particular, Russia proposes to set up bases in Batumi,  Akhalkalaki, and Vaziani.    Pavel Grachev stressed that, if this proposal is accepted,  the character of the tasks which Russian troops are performing  in Georgia and the conditions of their stay will change, insofar  as the cost of their upkeep will be shared equally. The  functions of the Russian troops will also change significantly  -- they will take part in collectively safeguarding the security  of the Transcaucasian region. Russia intends to maintain a  grouping of 23,000 servicemen in the Transcaucasus. In  addition, it is planned to locate a further base in Armenia and  a military facility in Azerbaijan.    Pavel Grachev stated that the heads of the two states will  be  presented with the prepared draft of a "Protocol Between the  Russian Federation and the Republic of Georgia on the Intended  Creation of Russian Military Bases on Georgian Territory." Two  further protocols have been prepared -- on the exchange of  military delegations and on technical aviation support for  aircraft and equipment on both Russian and Georgian territory.    The Russian Federation defense minister rejected Abkhazian  fears that Russia intends to significantly reinforce the  Georgian Army in technical respects. He stated that any steps  in this direction are possible only in the event of the solution  of the Abkhazian problem by political methods.    In an exclusive interview with KRASNAYA ZVEZDA Army General  Grachev stressed that the military delegation will raise at the  talks the issue of the inescapable liability of nationalist  extremist forces whose actions have led to the deaths of Russian  servicemen.</p>

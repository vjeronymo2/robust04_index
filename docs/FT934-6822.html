			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Levitt pleads guilty to one charge of fraudulent trading Mr Roger Levitt, the former chairman of the Levitt Group, the collapsed financial services company, unexpectedly altered his plea yesterday and admitted he was guilty of fraud. His admission - to a single charge of fraudulent trading - came eight days into his Old Bailey trial throughout which Mr Levitt had maintained his innocence. Yesterday's admission followed four days of legal argument in the absence of the jury. It is not expected that Mr Levitt will be sentenced until later this week. He was released on bail until today. He made no comment as he left the court with his wife Diana. His three co-defendants, Mr Mark Reed, Mr Robert Price and Mr Alan McNamara, all former Levitt Group directors, still face a similar charge of fraudulent trading. However, Mr David Cocks QC, for the Serious Fraud Office, told the court that following Mr Levitt's plea, the three men, who have also pleaded not guilty to the charge, may 'wish to consider their positions'. At the start of the trial, the prosecution had alleged that Mr Levitt had been guilty of fraudulent trading in three respects in a failed attempt to keep his ailing company afloat. The SFO claimed that Mr Levitt had illegally injected Pounds 21m of funds into his company, produced false accounts to overstate its profits and fraudulently misled Fimbra, the regulators for independent financial advisers. Yesterday, the jury were recalled to hear Mr Levitt plead guilty to the third particular of the charge - the fraudulent misleading of Fimbra. The jury of six men and six women were then directed by the judge to bring in a guilty verdict against him. The part of the charge admitted by Mr Levitt alleged that he showed Fimbra accounts, invoices, letters and minutes of a Levitt Group board meeting that were false, misleading and deceptive. He had done this in an attempt to show that fees of almost Pounds 21m had been received by the group as a result of his personal advisory work. Described by the prosecution as 'a past master as a salesman', Mr Levitt built up his company from small beginnings in the 1970s to a successful concern recording profits of Pounds 8m in 1988. However, by 1989, the prosecution claimed, it was in desperate financial trouble and heading for collapse. Between January 1989 and June 1990, the group incurred losses of Pounds 13m. In the 18 months before its collapse in December 1990 with debts of Pounds 34m, it was 'riddled with fraud, forgery, deception and downright dishonesty', Mr Cocks had argued. Mr Levitt had been the 'architect' of the fraud, he had said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 15 (KCNA) -- The League of Socialist  Working Youth of Korea [LSWYK] and the Tanzanian Youth Union  [TYU] released a joint statement here on May 13.    According to the statement, officials of the Central  Committee of the LSWYK and the members of the visiting  delegation of the TYU led by General Secretary Sukuwa S. Sukuwa  exchanged views on a series of matters.    The statement says:    The sides informed each other of their organizations'  activities and exchanged views on the development of friendly  relations between the two youth organizations, the current  international situation and the development of the world youth  and student movement.    The LSWYK noted with appreciation that the TYU has played an  important role and conducted brisk activities to build a new  independent society and consolidate the unity of the nation and  the country under the leadership of the Revolutionary Party of  Tanzania, maintaining the line of socialism and self-reliance.    The TYU highly estimated the fact that the LSWYK, united in  one mind around the great leader of the Korean people Comrade  Kim Il- song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, has  successfully discharged its mission and role in the struggle for  defending the Workers' Party of Korea and confidently  safeguarding and advancing the cause of socialism in the hard  time when the imperialists continue anti-socialist, anti-DPRK  moves.    The TYU bitterly denounced the United States and its  satellites for deploying Patriot missiles in South Korea and  rendering the situation of the Korean peninsula extremely  strained, while threatening sanctions against the DPRK through  the International Atomic Energy Agency and the United Nations  under the pretext of "the nuclear issue," and urged them to  promptly stop such moves.    The sides emphasized the need to support and closely  cooperate with each other in the common struggle for the  development of the world youth movement for solidarity against  imperialism and for peace and friendship and the cause of  socialism.</p>

			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Ignore county councils' cries of self-interest Sir, We now have the bizarre spectacle of county councils mounting at public expense a massive last-ditch campaign to influence the local government review. As someone who probably fits the media cliche 'well known in local business circles', I am intrigued by any claim that there is widespread support for the retention of County Hall here in Lancashire. Most people view it as a tier too many, an unnecessary and extremely expensive bureaucracy. Even more importantly, it is inevitably remote from the various local communities, be they business or private sector. If our county halls really believe their own propaganda, perhaps they would like to consider a referendum. My guess is that a vast majority of Lancastrians would demand devolution of power to a number of cost-conscious and accountable unitary authorities. Here in Chorley our council sets an excellent example in good housekeeping and accessibility to the people. Sadly, many of the major services that affect everyone are outside its remit and are an ongoing frustration to one and all. Oh that it were otherwise - and so says many a frustrated Lancastrian. If the government really believes in cost-effective local accountability, it should ignore the cries of self-interest echoing along vast county hall corridors.

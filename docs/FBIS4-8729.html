			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Martin Danes; </F> place and date not given: "Tension Between the Government and  Parliament Is Natural"]    [Text] [Danes] During the rule of the Civic Forum, discord  between the government and parliament was a somewhat regular  phenomenon. However, this situation continues even today. There  is discord not only between the coalition parties, but also  between Civic Democratic Party [ODS] ministers and deputies.  This has become apparent in the recent "compromise" regarding  the elections to the Senate. What is the reason for this  discord, and how could it be sorted out?    [Klaus] Our discussion about the elections to the Senate was  definitely not a standard dispute between the government and  parliament. It was not the natural dispute that can occur in  any. It would be an absolute mistake to draw fundamental  conclusions about relations between the government and  parliament from a declaration made by one ODS deputy at a  meeting of a group of coalition deputies. At most, we could ask  whether this deputy acted in compoliance with the decision taken  by the ODS Executive Council.    [Danes] There are other instances of discord between ODS  ministers and deputies. For example, the Housing Bill presented  by Dyba's Econhomics Ministry has been thoroughly redrafted by  parliament (with the participation of ODS deputies).    [Klaus] Unlike other, more formal laws, the Housing Law is a  political issue. Each of us has a certain position on the  housing problem. This is a classical example of a law that is  more likely to be changed by the deputies than other laws. I  would not draw any conclusions from this.    [Danes] You do not see any noticeable problems between the  ODS ministers and, for example, the ODS deputies, do you?    [Klaus] Instead of asking about controversy between the  government and parliament, you should rather ask about  controversy between the party leadership and some of its members.    [Danes] If the classical majority system for the elections  to the Senate is not approved in parliament, would you be in  favor of eliminating the Senate from the Constitution?    [Klaus] I hope that we will find a solution and that the  original government draft will pass. This is clear.  Restitution, the Senate, regional administration -- we are  tired of speaking about these problems. People who want to find  a solution different from the one that has been developed, more  of less through national consensus, are constantly bringing up  this issues. They force us, again and again, to take a position  on these issues. We have taken this position so many times.  Our reaction is abrupt because we have the feeling that they  are reopening issues that were closed a long time ago.</p>

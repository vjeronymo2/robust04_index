			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / 'Decisive phase' in Bosnia The Bosnian peace talks are reaching a 'decisive phase', Mr Klaus Kinkel, Germany's foreign minister, said yesterday after the 'contact group' comprising Russian, French, German, British and US officials held a special meeting in Berlin. Mr Kinkel said the contact group, led yesterday by the heads of the political directorates, must find a way to 'bring the Bosnian Serbs on board' and accept the peace plan already agreed by the Bosnian Croats and Moslems. He said time was running out as Washington was considering lifting the arms embargo, and there was pressure from Russia to lift sanctions imposed on Serbia now that President Slobodan Milosevic had apparently severed economic ties with the Bosnian Serbs. Mr Kinkel added that he remained disapppointed that Mr Milosevic had still not agreed to allow United Nations observers to monitor the border between Serbia and eastern Bosnia.</p>

The January issue of the Peruvian paper VIDA EMPRESARIAL in  an article headlined "DPRK Calls For General and Complete  Nuclear Disarmament" pointed out that the alleged nuclear  development and nuclear issue of North Korea were invented by  the United States and the South Korean authorities in a bid to  isolate and stifle the socialist system of Korea, leaving the  U.S. troops and nuclear weapons in South Korea intact.    Pressure or international sanctions have no effect, the  paper  said, stressing "Nuclear Issue of the Korean Peninsula Should Be  Solved Through the DPRK-U.S. Talks." Count-down, a mouthpiece  of the Japanese society of the participants in the international  solidarity march movement for supporting Korea's reunification,  said the only way of resolving the nuclear issue involving the  possibility to plunge the Korean peninsula into the horrors of  war is to make the DPRK-U.S. talks successful. The key to it  is the solution in a package deal proposed by the DPRK, said the  paper.    The Vietnamese paper PEOPLE'S ARMY January 12 said the  nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula is a delicate problem  affecting the peace and stability of Asia and the rest of the  world. It called for an impartial solution to the issue.</p>

			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CITIZEN INVOLVEMENT IN POLICE SHOOTINGS  </P> <P> In the past 11 1/2 years, there have been more than 150 people shot by the  police in Orange County and not one officer has been found guilty of any  wrongdoing or prosecuted by the district attorney. As long as his staff of  investigators continues to justify every single case involving police officers,  any reduction in police shooting is unlikely to occur.  </P> <P> Most of the police agencies are switching from the standard six-shot revolver  to rapid-fire, 9-millimeter semiautomatics, which have two to three time the  firing capacity.  </P> <P> With all the millions of dollars in lawsuits charging the police with excessive  force, I doubt that increasing their firepower using weapons that can fire up  to 19 rounds in a matter of seconds is going to reduce the rash of shootings.  </P> <P> There have been far too many cases where unarmed suspects have been shot or  killed here in Orange County. I think it's time that responsible non-police  citizens get involved in some of these shooting investigations where unarmed  people have been shot and killed.  </P> <P> How could the police be justified in shooting unarmed people in every single  case? Don't they carry batons or Mace? Why all the shooting?  </P> <P> If Orange County citizens were involved in some of these shooting  investigations, the number of shooting incidents would be reduced and there  wouldn't be all these millions of dollars in lawsuits.  </P> <P> MICHAEL MOHON  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

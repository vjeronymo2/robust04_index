			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FCC suggested that the position of chief executive officer be added to the definition of ``officer'' since a number of System institutions have both a president and a chief executive officer, or a chief executive officer rather than a president. The Board adopts this suggestion and also adds specific references to chief operating officers, chief financial officers, and chief credit officers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On a related issue, the FCC questioned whether an association's contracting with its supervising bank for a Standards of Conduct Officer would violate the joint employee provisions of &sect;612.2157. To clarify that it would not, unless the person otherwise satisfies the definition in &sect;612.2130(m), the term ``Standards of Conduct Officer'' is changed to the ``Standards of Conduct Official'' in the final regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FCC recommended that the term ``financially obligated'' be defined, and that prohibited ``financially obligated'' transactions be more clearly distinguished from business relationships that are permissible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final regulations define ``financially obligated with'' to mean having a joint legally enforceable obligation with, being financially obligated on behalf of (contingently or otherwise), having an enforceable legal obligation secured by a property owned by another, or owning property that secures an enforceable legal obligation of another. The Board's revision to &sect;&sect;612.2140(g) and 612.2150(h) responds to the request to distinguish permissible business relationships from prohibited ``financially obligated with'' relationships and is discussed below under those sections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of this revision, the term ``business proprietor'' is no longer used in the regulations and its definition has been deleted. In addition, to avoid any possible confusion relative to reporting requirements, the definition for the term ``business relationship'' or ``transacts business'' has been deleted in the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition of ``ordinary course of business'' in the final regulations has been added as described in the discussion of &sect;612.2140.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition of ``family'' has been clarified to spell out more specifically those persons included under the phrase ``and each person having such relationships by marriage.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 612.2135_Director and Employee Responsibilities and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Conduct_Generally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No comments were received on this section and it is adopted as proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 612.2140_Directors_Prohibited Conduct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board proposed to adopt some of the specific prohibitions applicable to employees and specifically requested comments on whether these prohibitions would operate too restrictively on directors. A number of comments were received. The majority of commenters opposed the proposed prohibition in paragraph (f) of this section concerning a director's purchasing property owned by the director's institution or an institution it supervises or is supervised by during the preceding 12 months when such property was acquired through foreclosure or similar action. The FCC asserted that a strict prohibition would make it more difficult to attract or retain qualified directors and suggested that such purchases be permitted on an institution-by-institution basis depending on whether the institution has adequate controls in place to ensure that directors do not receive an advantage or favoritism over other prospective purchasers. Other commenters suggested that there are less restrictive alternatives available to avoid real or apparent conflicts of interest and ensure continued public confidence in the System. One alternative offered was a general prohibition on acquired property purchases by directors except by public auction or open competitive bidding. The commenters also disagreed that the potential for conflicts of interest is as great for directors as it is for employees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After additional consideration of the issues in light of the public comments, the Board has concluded that a total prohibition of director purchases of acquired property may be overly restrictive. Directors of Farm Credit Banks, associations, and certain directors of agricultural credit banks, except outside directors, are required to be farmers, ranchers, or producers or harvesters of aquatic products, and as such may want to acquire additional land that becomes available in their communities. Restrictions on their ability to acquire land that becomes available for sale from the institution while they are serving as director could be a serious disincentive for a successful individual to serve as a director. On the other hand, the potential for conflict is especially serious where there is strong motivation for acquiring property owned by the institution. Therefore, it is important that there be adequate controls in place to ensure that the director's impartiality is not impaired and that the director does not use his or her position to gain some advantage in acquiring property. The final regulations do not prohibit such acquisitions, but require that the property be purchased at public auctions or in open competitive bidding. In addition, to avoid the appearance of conflict, it is important that a director interested in acquiring such property not participate in deliberations or decisions concerning foreclosure or disposition of that property. Therefore, the final regulations prohibit a director from acquiring such property, even through public auction or competitive bidding, if he or she has participated in the decision to foreclose or dispose of the property or in establishing the terms of the sale.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

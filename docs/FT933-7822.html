			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: The best of the worst in English Sir, Further to James Morgan's amusing article 'As they say in Europe: English like it should be spoke' (August 14/15), within one hour recently I heard on the BBC: 'Most women should be able to breast feed themselves', and 'The prisoner was sentenced to three years in Reading High Court'. Humour in errors? There must be hundreds of similarly amusing grammatical errors - how about publishing the best submitted?

			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (9): Four hundred sensors monitor production - System Profile THERE are 400 sensors continuously monitoring 10,000 variables in the steel and tube-making process at Vallourec's Saint-Saulve plant, linked to a controller supplied by French company, April. This machine and an automated furnace controller are connected to three communications processors from the US company, DEC. These processors are linked in turn through an Ethernet local area network to three DEC Microvax computers, which control the production process, analyse the data and send information over the Ethernet network to operators equipped with Sun Microsystems workstations. If one Microvax goes out of action, the other two automatically take over the workload. At worst, one machine can handle the entire workload, although response times at the operator workstations would be slower. Also attached to the network is a fourth Microvax which controls the database of 96 hours' worth of production data. Finally, there are links from the overall system through one of the network processors to a Concurrent Computer minicomputer running business systems such as order processing. The system gives steel plant operators information about the production process and alerts them if a variable such as temperature goes outside specified limits. If that happens, it consults a table to find which associated variables it should analyse to determine what might be wrong and suggests corrective action to the operators. If they do not acknowledge the alarm, then the system tries again - and, on the third alarm, it will automatically take the corrective action itself. All the data relating to 96 hours' production is captured to give a management view of how manufacturing is progressing and to help pinpoint possible problem areas.</p>

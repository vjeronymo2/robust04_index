			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Denmark expects to be among elite of EMS: Finance minister Mogens Lykketoft sees the krone as a core hard currency DENMARK expects to be among the core hard-currency countries when new arrangements are made for the European Monetary System, according to Mr Mogens Lykketoft, the finance minister. 'The Danish economy in fundamental respects is strong and we shall have no problem joining the core (ERM) counties. That is our clear intention,' Mr Lykketoft, a leading figure in the Social Democrat-led coalition, said in an interview with the Financial Times. However, he said he does not expect new ERM arrangements to be implemented 'for some time' following the forced move to wider 15 per cent bands two months ago. He said the original January 1 deadline for a return to the previous 2 1/4 per cent fluctuation bands had little chance of being realised. Mr Lykketoft is presiding over an economy registering a large current account surplus and an inflation rate of just over 1 per cent. However, unemployment is around 12 per cent. As a result of a shift to fiscal policy expansion this year, the budget deficit has grown to about 6 per cent of gross domestic product. The Danish krone, which came under severe speculative pressure during the summer monetary crisis, has lately been holding up relatively well on the currency markets. The krone has appreciated slightly against the European currency unit since the end of July, although it has fallen by about 4 per cent against the D-Mark. After two cuts in the official discount rate, the most recent by 0.5 points to 8.25 per cent on September 27, the financial markets are expecting further gradual reductions in short-term interest rates. Mr Lykketoft said Denmark's opt out from the Maastricht treaty commitment to economic and monetary union had only limited relevance to the government's monetary policies. The minister said: 'This (the third stage of the move to Emu) lies a very long way ahead and so the question is without any interest.' The government's fiscal expansion is expected to produce some extra buoyancy in an economy which will show no growth this year and has only grown by about 1 per cent annually since 1986. The government is planning a DKr12bn (Dollars 1.81bn) increase in spending power, equivalent to 1.2 per cent of GDP, in the 1994 budget, accomplished by temporary reductions in personal taxation and increases in budget spending, especially on infrastructure. Mr Lykketoft does not see any incompatibility between the expansive fiscal policy and an easing of monetary policy and lower interest rates. He said that both the reduction in taxation - a consequence of a big reform of the tax system which will take effect in 1994 - and expenditure increases are temporary. 'There will be no further easing of fiscal policy after 1994,' he said. The fiscal expansion will make only a minor dent in the current balance of payments surplus, which will slip from about DKr27bn - 3.5 per cent of GDP - to about DKr23bn in 1994, he said. The government expects a demand boost to increase the GDP growth rate to 2.9 per cent in 1994, with real private consumption rising by 4 per cent. Virtually all non-government forecasters consider the government growth forecasts too optimistic. The right-wing opposition parties predict continued stagnation, leading to a new crisis next year caused by a rising budget deficit. However, Mr Lykketoft, an economist by training, said he considers the the forecasts 'fully realistic'. The tax concessions alone mean that real disposable household incomes will increase by 4-5 per cent next year. Mr Lykketoft said that the fact that home-owners can extend mortgages from 20 years to 30 years will give the typical householder extra spending money of several thousand kroner a month next year, so his forecast was not 'too optimistic'.</p>

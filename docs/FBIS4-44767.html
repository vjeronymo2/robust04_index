			<p>Gigaherz   <F P=102>   94WS0296A Stockholm NY TEKNIK in Swedish 24 Mar 94 pp 14, 16 </F> <F P=103> 94WS0296A </F> <F P=104>  Stockholm NY TEKNIK </F> <F P=105>  Swedish </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ulla Karlsson: "Ultrarapid Transistor Raises </F> Band Frequency to the Highest Level;" initial paragraph is NY  TEKNIK introduction]    [Text] The key to the communications network of the future  exists at Chalmers. An extremely fast transistor which becomes  the building block of tomorrow's wireless communications system.  It opens the door to an infinity of unutilized frequency bands,  band which all lie above 20 gigaherz, where one will be forced  to communicate in the future.    A transistor which works at a frequency of 380 gigaherz.  That  is the result of eight years of research at Chalmers Institute  of Technology in Goteborg. Here is one of the world's best  research groups on high-speed electronics. A group which during  the last six years has created 10 generations of the fastest  transistor type HFET (Heterostructure Field Effect Transistor).  HFETs which through new material combinations and refined  lithography methods (methods of writing the pattern lines from  which circuits are made, have become increasingly faster with  each generation.  <H5>  380 Gigaherz </H5>   "A few months ago we arrived at limiting frequencies of 380  gigahertz," says Herbert Zirath, a researcher at the department  for microwave technology. "I did not think that was possible a  few years ago."    These rapid transistors can now become the solution to a  problem that is difficult to solve in today's communications  society--the lack of frequencies. Because regardless of how blue  the sky looks, it is jampacked with carrying frequencies.  Frequencies which bring television images, radio, mobile  telephones and a great deal more. Up to 1 gigahertz it is really  crowded, then it thins out a little, after which an ocean of  free frequencies spreads out above 20 gigahertz. This is where  international standards organizations now want to place the  links to the mobile communications networks of the future,  wireless local data networks and new services such as video on  demand. But that is easier said than done. Completely new  high-frequency components that can be mass produced and new  monolithic circuits are needed in order to develop circuits  which work in the millimeter wavelength range.    This is where the transistor at Chalmers enters the picture.  With the transistor as a building block new circuits for  communication in the gigahertz range have already seen the light  of day. Among them are, for example, a hybrid circuit in which  the researchers have used an HFET as a resistive frequency mixer  up to 120 gigahertz. This is something they alone in the world  have achieved. Other research groups have only achieved 35  gigahertz.    The mixer is part of a whole family of circuits which the  researchers are now working with, a family which together will  create a combined sender/receiver for the 55-gigahertz  frequency. It would, for example be possible to use it as a  digital radio link connecting base stations in a future  telephone net. Here the researchers are working with Ericsson  Radar and with financial support from Nutek.  <H5>  Even Higher </H5>   The Chalmers researchers are also moving even higher up in  the frequency range. On behalf of the Swedish Space Corporation  they are developing an HFET-based receiver for radioastronomy.  It is to work in the 119 gigahertz frequency and be installed in  the Swedish satellite Odin, a satellite which according to plans  is to be launched in the year 1997.  <H5>  Compact Design </H5>   But if equipment for satellites can be permitted to be  expensive, the same does not apply for equipment to be used  publicly. Instead, it involves compact design in combination  with large volumes, which in turn result in low prices. The  Chalmers researchers, together with researchers at the  University of Michigan, have found a solution to that problem.  As the first research group in the world they have integrated a  slot aerial with an HFET mixer and a lens.  <H5>  Monolithic Integration </H5>   The group is now working intensely on integrating  transistors  and circuits on one and the same semiconductor chip, so-called  monolithic integration. Through the integration it will now be  possible to generate and amplify signals on the same circuit,  something which in turn makes it possible to build a monolithic  amplifier on a single chip. Yes, perhaps even with a combined  sender/receiver on one chip. This in turn yields compact  equipment and the possibility of mass production, with lower  prices as a result.    "While manufacturing the HFETs we have today arrived at more  than 90 percent flawless circuits. And that is what is needed in  order to manufacture integrated circuits," says Herbert Zirath.  <H5>  A High-Frequency World </H5>   The fast transistors which have been developed at Chalmers  Institute of Technology can be used for the following, among  others:     -  Radio links which can be used for telecommunication  in cities where fiberoptics are difficult to install (60 GHz),  communication systems for cars and trains and wireless data  networks in offices.    -  Radar applications as intelligent speed  controls in cars (77 GHz), three-dimensional images of radar  targets, landing systems for aircraft during poor visibility (94  Ghz) and phase-controlled antennas.    -  Instruments such as  receivers with low intrinsic noise for radioastronomy (119 Ghz).    -  Fiberoptic communication with a speed of 40 gigabits per  second. The transistor can then be used to build laser  modulators, optical receivers and circuits which pick out the  clock concealed in the bit stream.</p>

			<p><P> August 21, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN A TEST OF WILLS, PANAMA'S NORIEGA SHOWS NO SIGNS OF BENDING TO U.S.  </P> <P> More than a week of spectacular American military maneuvers, fruitless  political negotiations and a shift of U.S. policy has failed again to break the  will of Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, Panama's military ruler. He remains in full  control with no indication that he will give up power.  </P> <P> "There are no signs of any progress," a diplomatic source said in a telephone  interview over the weekend. "There is no reason for optimism" in the effort to  drive Noriega from power.  </P> <P> Washington has sought the removal of the general it once favored since early  1988, when Noriega was indicted by two federal grand juries in Florida on  drug-trafficking charges. The United States tried last week to raise the  pressure by staging aggressive and large-scale military maneuvers, including  exercises in the streets of Panama City, under the guise of asserting rights  under the Panama Canal treaties that assign the defense of the waterway to  American troops.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Designed to Weaken Morale  </P> <P> However, military sources acknowledged that the U.S. maneuvers also were  designed to weaken the morale of the Panama Defense Forces and undermine  Noriega's arguments that the Americans have neither the will nor the ability to  threaten his power.  </P> <P> Until two weeks ago, American maneuvers were generally limited to running  convoys between various U.S. bases along the canal. But starting Aug. 9, the  U.S. Southern Command, which is based just outside Panama City, changed its  policy.  </P> <P> That day, heavily armed American units using armored troop carriers and  helicopters blockaded Ft. Amador, a large installation shared by the Panama  Defense Forces and U.S. troops and containing key Panamanian military  facilities, including an office and house used by Noriega.  </P> <P> Then, after a series of small but potentially deadly confrontations between  U.S. and Panamanian forces last week, American columns began moving through the  streets of Panama City.  </P> <P> At one point, U.S. soldiers occupied a large area of the downtown section where  Panama's courts are located. Then, last Thursday, a special U.S. Marine Corps  strike force using helicopters descended on the area surrounding the American  Embassy and closed it off to Panamanian forces.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'It Was Something to See'  </P> <P> "It was spectacular," said a witness in a telephone conversation. "The  helicopters suddenly appeared and the Marines came down on ropes. It was  something to see."  </P> <P> Panama has protested that the exercises are invasions of its sovereignty and  are tantamount to a military invasion. One U.S. official countered that  SouthCom, as the Southern Command is commonly called, is "bringing to bear  sufficient force to assert U.S. treaty rights as called for by President Bush."  </P> <P> So far, the Panamanians have backed off, but "the confrontations have led to  potentially explosive situations," said a diplomat.  </P> <P> How long an incident of shooting can be avoided is questionable, said a  European diplomat. "The PDF is clearly stung and is increasingly frustrated,  and it is stepping up its harassment of individual Americans in the country."  </P> <P> Against this military posturing has been a sputtering and so far meaningless  round of talks between Noriega's agents and leaders of the country's political  opposition.  </P> <P> Under auspices of the Organization of American States, the two sides have been  trying to negotiate an end to the political crisis that arose after Noriega  refused to accept what international observers said was the overwhelming defeat  of the general's handpicked candidate for president in elections May 7. The  observers said that Noriega first tried to rig the vote count. When that  failed, his puppet civilian administration nullified the election, and Noriega  has since rejected all suggestions that the opposition, internationally viewed  as the clear winner, be installed in office.  </P> <P> The opposition, insisting it should be allowed to take power on the Sept. 1  date fixed by the constitution, has proposed a plebiscite on whether Noriega  should give up power. The general has said no.  </P> <P> As it stands, face-to-face talks broke down Friday, although the OAS says that  indirect talks continue, with Secretary General Joao Baena Soares shuttling  between the contending sides.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Opposition Sees No Hope  </P> <P> Carlos Duque, Noriega's presidential candidate, told reporters Saturday that  "we are determined as ever to find a political solution" through the indirect  talks. But opposition sources said in a telephone interview that they expect  nothing to come of the talks.  </P> <P> "This is the last stage," said Ricardo Arias Calderon of the opposition  Christian Democratic Party, "and I don't see how anything can come of this when  the government wouldn't move in direct talks."  </P> <P> A diplomat close to the talks echoed that sentiment. "When they were sitting in  the same room, they just repeated the same old stands and were talking past  each other. Now they are sitting in separate rooms and talking past each  other."  </P> <P> Other opposition sources, who asked not to be named to avoid offending the  United States, said the situation hasn't been helped by what they see as  waffling by the Bush Administration.  </P> <P> After steadfastly insisting that not only must Noriega give up power but that  he must also leave Panama, the Administration last week changed its position.  State Department spokesmen said that Washington now insists only that Noriega  relinquish power, although they could not explain how that might be  accomplished if he is allowed to remain in the country.  </P> <P> "That sort of thing only gives Noriega confidence," said an opposition source.  "He has always believed that he can outlast the Americans, and when Washington  backs down, even a little bit, he gains confidence."  </P> <P> For his part, Noriega is increasing his pressure on the opposition and is  increasingly isolating the country from outside influences.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seized TV Network  </P> <P> Last week, for example, he seized and shut down a privately owned television  network that, in a cautious way, had broadcast some opposition views.  </P> <P> In addition, Noriega has all but closed his country to outside journalists.  With the limited exceptions of brief visits by American and British news  agencies that distribute their services to government-controlled newspapers, no  correspondent for major American and European newspaper and broadcast media has  been allowed into Panama since the end of May.  </P> <P> "Noriega thinks if he keeps you (foreign reporters) out, the world will forget  what's going on here and the international pressure against him will go away,"  a European diplomat said.  </P> <P> So far, even American diplomats agree. "I personally don't see any more reason  for Noriega to leave now than before," said one such official. "He outlasted us  before, and he may well do it again."  </P></p>

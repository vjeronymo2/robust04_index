			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> COMMENTS ON OUR LIFE AND TIMES;  </P> <P> POLITE AGIT-POP EXHIBIT IN 'A FOREST OF SIGNS'  </P> <P> Today the Museum of Contemporary Art launches an ambitious examination of an  influential and contentious branch of contemporary art. On view at the museum's  agreeably cavernous Temporary Contemporary wing in Little Tokyo until Aug. 13,  the survey is called "A Forest of Signs" and presents works by 30 American  artists, including such luminaries as Jenny Holzer, Jeff Koons and Cindy  Sherman. Even viewed during its installation, the exhibition clearly promised  to be an event to be reckoned with.  </P> <P> Since the late '70s, artists of the stamp seen here have tried to revolutionize  the way we look at art. Actually, according to this lot, we no longer look at  art in the conventional sense -- soaking it up through our eyeballs -- we read  art like a book. Actually we read it more like a somewhat cryptic advertising  poster. If you happen to be one of those people who hates to read standing up,  this can be tiresome.  </P> <P> If you also happen to be one of those conscientious souls who bones up before  going to an exhibition, the verbal bunting surrounding this one is sufficiently  intimidating to make your self-confidence shrivel up like an overcooked pea.  The catalogue -- with several refreshing exceptions -- is couched in the kind  of language seemingly designed to make the ordinary viewer who doesn't much  like the show feel that it is his own fault because he is just too dumb to  understand it. Essays are laced with references to esoteric contemporary  philosophical systems having to do with the analysis of language and punctuated  with buzz-words like semiotics, deconstruction, texts and appropriation.  </P> <P> Not to worry. The actual exhibition is considerably more straightforward than  the writing that is supposed to clarify it. Take just one example by Mitchell  Syrop, a big painting-cum-poster which reads, "This is one of those great  masterpieces that will go unrecognized in its own time. This is your  once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make a decision that will reward you in the  future."  </P> <P> Oh. That's easy. Syrop's work is a satire of the shameless commercialism and  self-promotion rife in today's art world. It is also very much a part of that  which it satirizes.  </P> <P> Syrop is not the most interesting artist in the exhibition, but he is among the  most typical. Another group of his poster-like images is united by a common  slogan familiar from brassiere ads and instructions on how to open packages,  "Lift and Separate." Syrop combines this slogan with a variety of images -- a  slick ad photo of an enthralled symphony audience applauding, a workman's lunch  bucket, fancy silverware.  </P> <P> On the face of it, the recombination seems to demonstrate how the meaning of  the slogan changes each time it is put up against a different image. On  reflection, however, we realize that is always saying the same thing, namely  that advertising always encourages us to better our condition, get richer and  consume more. That's the "Lift" part. The "Separate" part suggests that as we  rise in the consumer hierarchy we are parted from any grass-roots group we  might have come from and are thus less likely to act with them politically to  improve the lot of the "masses." Syrop is saying that in a capitalist society  "Lift and Separate" means "Divide and Conquer."  </P> <P> Aside from the mild intellectual fun of cracking Syrop's "code," it is hard to  imagine who would find such tired Marxist cant revelatory. Understanding how  his art works, however, does cast some general light on the genre -- both the  artworks and the intellectual fog surrounding them tend to act as a blind for  social criticism or -- given the markedly equivocal nature of much of the work  -- social "comment."  </P> <P> Since when does art "comment"? Isn't a comment a fairly minor reaction to the  main event? Talk-show hosts comment. Cartoonists comment. Recently Doonesbury's  artist character J.J. was commissioned to paint the john on Donald Trump's  yacht with a faked-up Michelangelo mural. She decided this outrageous sell-out  of her talent was a "comment" on nouveau-riche consumerism.  </P> <P> Does Michelangelo's David "comment" on heroism? Tom Lawson presents a piece  that juxtaposes a photograph of the standing David with a shot of the Forest  Lawn version toppled by an earthquake. It is a quite wonderful comment on  artistic authenticity in our time, but that's all it is, a visual quip, a  one-liner.  </P> <P> The show is full of them. Sara Charlesworth uses the front pages of newspapers  to remind us that the same stories and images make up the daily news around the  world. Getchen Bender puts her own captions on TV sets broadcasting the usual  fare. Richard Prince letters smutty jokes on canvases.  </P> <P> Why does it all seem so flat and familiar?  </P> <P> The work, on the whole, does not react to human reality. It is a reaction to a  vastly popular substitute for reality: The World According to The Media.  </P> <P> These artists work as if they have no friends, lovers or family. They work as  if they never left the city or smelled the roses. I take that back. Chris  Williams photographs flowers like a botanist. Most, however, work as if they  spent their lives shuttling from reading Foucault and Derrida to staring at the  telly, analyzing magazines, listening to their Walkmans and having paranoid  fantasies about the coercions of the American Corporate structure (while  plotting how to sell art to corporate collections and become art stars).  </P> <P> They have a love-hate obsession with big-league communications. They ape its  objectivity and get stuck with its deadhead heartlessness. Sure, there are  exceptions. Jack Goldstein's paintings of electrical storms have a frightening  cold passion. Jeff Koons' art-vending machine and his kitsch knickknack  sculpture betray bittersweet affection. Barbara Bloom's neoclassical room gets  beyond its own feminist "comment" and into a realm of brittle, wistful  elegance.  </P> <P> "A Forest of Signs" gets one thing wrong from ground zero. The title is from a  poem by Baudelaire that suggests that the job of art is to find correspondences  between itself and life. He didn't mean the kinds of intellectualized semaphore  signals broadcast by this show, he meant correspondences between sensations.  There is hardly a one to be had here.  </P> <P> All the same, the exhibition, organized by Mary Jane Jacob, is the most  penetrating survey of its kind I have yet seen. It traces this art's roots from  Pop and Conceptualism in the '60s to its present estate as what? A kind of  polite Agit-Pop, a sort of rococo impersonation of the social art of the  revolutionary Russian avant-garde. It also reads as a strange mutant rebirth of  middle-class 19th-Century narrative art, which appealed to its bourgeoise  audience with anecdotes. You don't have to know about art to get this work.  </P> <P> By negatives the exhibition proves that it is not enough for art to reflect its  society because this surely does that. Art needs to leave itself room to  express more than it intended. This work is too shallow and too much in  control. It can only tell us what we already know. Maybe a little more. An  amount of fear seeps out of Holzer's wallpaper word wall. Longo's contorted  figures mean to broadcast ambiguous agony, but their detachment curdles into  nastiness. There is considerable general anxiety around the edges which  questionsthe whole artistic enterprise as if the artists are wondering if they  are not wrecking a noble edifice from within.  </P> <P> Mike Kelley presents an installation in the form of a long, narrow corridor  lined with giant portraits of artists, poets and assorted intellectuals. Each  bears a quotation in which the subject identifies with violent criminals,  destructive madmen and social outcasts. Jean Genet says, "I want to sing  murderers and love murderers."  </P> <P> Having set us up to wallow in this romantic rhetoric, Kelley then opposes it by  ending the series with a small, barely identifiable drawing of an actual mass  murderer. At the entrance to the hallway stand plastic containers soliciting  donations to be given to a Victim's Rights fund.  </P> <P> Kelley's piece recalls that terrible incident when novelist Norman Mailer  interceded to get a murderer released from prison because he was a gifted  writer only to have his protege turn around and waste an innocent citizen.  </P> <P> A strange Populist literalism laces Kelley's piece. It tends to make artists  look like a pack of featherbrained crackpots because it fails to maintain a  simple distinction between the imaginative and the real. In caving into the  merely topical and the excessively prosaic, the artists of "A Forest of Signs"  betray fear of the leap of imagination and threaten themselves with becoming as  dated and disposable as, well, yesterday's newspaper.  </P> <P> IN WARHOL'S FOOTSTEPS: Avant-Garde artists talk about the New Criticality.

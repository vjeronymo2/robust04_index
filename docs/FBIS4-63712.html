			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow, May 25 (ITAR-TASS) -- "After issuing three  documents -- a presidential message, a mini-message on  non-payments of April 12 as well as a document on civic accord,"  the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper writes, "the president again  took the initiative of running the economy and reform into his  own hands.    "This action is connected with the president's wish to  establish full control over actions by the premier and the  entire economic bloc of the government and to deprive the  cabinet of any independence, including independence of a  political manoeuvre."    Amplifying this theme, the ROSSIISKIE VESTI newspaper notes  that "in the political respect, the president's 'economic'  decrees gave a pretext for suppositions that he is forced to  'prod' the passive government, thrusting on it his  'strong-willed' decisions which were made all of a sudden".    "According to information received at the presidential press  service," the newspaper writes in another article, "Boris  Yeltsin will meet the leadership of the Russian Government this  week in order to analyse the progress of economic reform and to  map out measures to remove 'bottlenecks' in its way."    "Despite expectations, the Moscow talks between the Russian  and Ukrainian premiers," writes the NOVAYA EZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA  newspaper, "centred not on the conflict between Simferopol and  Kiev but on the problem of the Black Sea Fleet.    "The sides stressed proximity and importance of these themes  in bilateral relations. Although the discussion has not brought  specific results, the cabinet heads appraised the meeting rather  optimistically."    The same newspaper writes in another article that "Russia  should not fully rely on the Baykonur Cosmodrome as the main  launching pad for Russian space explorations in future.    "This is true even of the next 20 years about which the two  presidents (eds: Boris Yeltsin and Nursultan Nazarbayev) talked  in Moscow. Governments were changing in the recent past more  often than space rockets."    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an interview with Vladimir  Gusev,  head of the Russian federal tax service, who said that "the  state collected taxes worth over 38,000 billion rubles and 340  million U.S. dollars for 1993".    The same newspaper features an interview with Vadim Gustov,  chairman of the Russian parliament upper house committee on the  Commonwealth of Independent States, saying that "economy  dictates its rules to politicians.    "These are stiff rules. Politicians should start thinking  how to pool efforts, natural resources, workforce and the  intellectual potential in order to pull out of the crisis.    "It is clear for all that there is no way back to the former  centralised rigid system of management. It means that we should  look for another way, to find versions acceptable for all, to  come to agreement.    "It can be a Eurasian Union proposed by Nazarbayev or  something else. However, it is necessary to start preparing now  a legislative basis for it as well as a concept for cooperation  and manageability of economies."    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA runs an interview with speaker of the  former Russian parliament Ruslan Khasbulatov, saying: "Serious  praiseworthy opposition leaders are doomed to take a peaceful  road and to act in compliance with law. But it is highly  probable that authorities will reply with artillery volleys to  their constructive initiatives".    The TRUD newspaper informs its readers that "head of the  Russian president's office Sergey Filatov submitted documents to  the government about gold reserves of the Russian empire stored  abroad.    "The documents are supplied with Filatov's recommendation to  set up an interdepartmental commission to return gold home."    According to the KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper, "the  Russian  president will hear counterintelligence officers on Wednesday to  hammer out a single concept for their operations.    "It happened that starting from the year 1991, victorious  for  democracy, Russia had no common doctrine for the country's  security, including the sphere of shielding against foreign  secret services.    "Confidential sources at the federal conterintelligence  service inform that precisely this reason prompted the general  summit of Russian counterintelligence leaders."    The KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper carries an interview with  Anatoliy Golovnev, deputy commander-in-chief of Russian land  forces, who stresses: "The quality of training troops suffers  due to the untimely development and delivery by the Ministry of  the Munitions Industry of simulators to new models of weapons  and combat materiel.    "The cost of weapons grows, since we are forced to train on  combat materiel. How soon will the situation change for the  better? This depends on how soon we agree that the state's might  is also a level of its army's training."    The PRAVDA newspaper writes that "an official report that  five prominent Latvian politicians had been KGB agents, became a  real sensation in Latvia. The republican prosecutor-general  made recently this report to local legislators.    "Incumbent foreign minister G. Andreyevs is among the above  five. True, the final say belongs to the court of law. However,  all the five are now vehemently deny their former affiliation  with the KGB."</p>

			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GIAMATTI GIVEN 2ND COURT DEFEAT ON ROSE;  </P> <P> APPEALS PANEL REFUSES TO UPSET ORDER BLOCKING DISCIPLINARY HEARING  </P> <P> A state appeals court today refused to disturb a judge's order temporarily  preventing the commissioner of baseball from holding a disciplinary hearing on  charges that Pete Rose bet on his own team's games.  </P> <P> The ruling was the second court loss in four days for Commissioner A. Bartlett  Giamatti.  </P> <P> On Sunday, Common Pleas Judge Norbert A. Nadel granted Rose a 14-day temporary  restraining order blocking the hearing. Nadel said Giamatti had already made up  his mind against Rose and could not give him a fair hearing.  </P> <P> Baseball's lawyers asked an Ohio appeals court to nullify the order, arguing  that it interferes with the commissioner's powers to protect the integrity of  the game.  </P> <P> But a three-judge appellate panel this afternoon said it has no authority to  review a temporary restraining order.  </P> <P> Baseball's lawyers could not be immediately reached for comment on whether they  will pursue their appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court.  </P> <P> Rose is accused of gambling on his own team, an offense that could get him  banned from the game for life.  </P> <P> The allegations against the Cincinnati Reds manager are in a 225-page report by  chief baseball investigator John M. Dowd and eight accompanying volumes of  evidence.  </P> <P> Among other things, the report contains statements by a former Rose associate  that Rose conferred with other baseball managers before deciding whether to bet  on their teams and tried to get involved in cocaine deals.  </P> <P> The drug accusations against Rose were made in February by Paul Janszen, a  bodybuilder who recently completed a four-month stay in a halfway house for  failing to report income from the sale of steroids on his taxes. He said Rose  tried to get involved in the cocaine deals of his other associates.  </P> <P> It was the first time Rose has been publicly linked to drugs by testimony in  the investigation, which was announced March 20. The report was released  Monday.  </P> <P> Janszen didn't say Rose used drugs but said the manager thought he could get  cash from drug deals conducted by a circle of associates. Rose sometimes had  trouble paying his large gambling debts, Janszen said.  </P> <P> Several of the associates were sentenced after federal authorities cracked a  ring that took cocaine from Florida to Ohio.  </P></p>

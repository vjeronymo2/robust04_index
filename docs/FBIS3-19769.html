The young  pilots are to arrive at the Lufthansa passenger plane pilot  school in Phoenix, Arizona, by the end of this month. The  tender was issued by Air China, the largest of the seven Chinese  airlines.    Lufthansa hopes that it will subsequently be able to take  over the training program for the Boeing 737, which would be  held in Bremen. Since aviation is increasing in China,  thousands of pilots have to be trained, a Lufthansa spokesman  said. At the end of the 1980's, the passenger plane pilot  school took over consulting tasks at the pilot school in central  China.</p>

			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Compensation delay INVESTORS in home income schemes hoping to get compensation after a High Court ruling in July are having to wait for another court hearing. The Investors Compensation Scheme, which limits the maximum payout per claim to Pounds 48,000, and law firm Barnett Sampson have been unable to agree on interpreting one point of the judgment and have decided to seek clarification. Home income plans were sold late in the 1980s, mainly to elderly people, as a way to release income from their homes. The schemes involved taking out a mortgage and investing in equity-linked bonds. In many cases, the risk of the investment bonds was not explained and investors who lost money have grounds for compensation. In July, Barnett Sampson won extended compensation rights for victims. At issue was whether those who had taken out a home income plan before the ICS started on August 28 1988 had any compensation rights. The ICS argued that claims could be made only by investors who took out a plan on or after that date. But the court decided that investors can get compensation for losses occurring as a result of poor advice after August 28 1988, even if they had taken out their plans before that date. It is on this point that the two sides now have differences of interpretation. The ICS wants clarification about the date from which compensation should be calculated and to determine exactly what event would trigger a liability. Barnett Sampson says there does not have to be any positive action for an investor to be eligible for compensation, and that a failure to act by an independent adviser also can trigger a liability. Tom Murphy, a Liverpool pensioner, was an investor with Hamilton House Associates, a Birkenhead-based investment business which was ordered by Fimbra, the self-regulating body for IFAs, to stop trading in February 1990. He took out a fixed rate investment bond on June 20 1988; this was meant to have been secured against property but appears not to have been. His Pounds 18,000 compensation claim depends on the judgment. 'I am bewildered,' he says. 'When I read about the judgment in July, I thought my claim would be all right, but it's now been held up again. I have been through 3 1/2 years of hell over this.' Investors who benefited from another point clarified by the High Court judgment are not having to wait for compensation. The court decided that the ICS was wrong to propose halving the amount of compensation to a surviving spouse.</p>

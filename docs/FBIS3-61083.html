			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Gornostayev: "Russia Will Not Take the </F> Exams: The Relations of It and Other East European Countries  With the North Atlantic Bloc Are, as Has Become Clear Following  the Brussels Meeting, To Assume the Nature of Partnership"]    [Text] Brussels-Moscow--It has been said for several years  now that it is essential under the new conditions following the  end of the cold war to move toward a qualitatively new level of  relations between West and East, primarily Russia. And so,  finally, more or less specific decisions were adopted at the  meetings of the NATO Council on 2 December and the North  Atlantic Cooperation Council a day later in Brussels on the  interaction of the once mutually hostile parts of the  Euro-Atlantic space. The "Partnership for Peace," about which  people began to speak following the October visit to Moscow of  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, formed the basis of  this interaction. The basis of the concept was laid, if we  glance into recent history, by Russia in President Boris  Yeltsin's message to the NATO Council session in December of the  year before last, which spoke not of membership of the bloc but  of the intention of full-scale cooperation with it in specific  spheres. Then, when a number of East European  countries--Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic,  Slovakia--advanced the idea of swift and urgent affiliation with  NATO, the Americans presented this concept, in new packaging, it  is true. One way or another, it is an expansion of partner  relations, not quantitative expansion, which has been approved  by both NATO and the NACC [North Atlantic Cooperation Council].    For Russia this is important primarily because on these  terms  it will not be isolated from the process of Euro-Atlantic  integration, which could have happened given NATO's  reinforcement by former participants in the Warsaw Pact. Their  overriding idea concerning affiliation to the North Atlantic  alliance was not taken seriously in principle. Largely thanks to  the active explanatory work of Russian diplomacy, incidentally.  And now, according to Andrey Kozyrev, minister of foreign  affairs of the Russian Federation, this idea has been buried. It  is gratifying that the decision on the expansion not of the bloc  itself but of specific partner relations among all states was  adopted at the NACC session by consensus, having obtained  support not only on the part of NATO and Russia but of the  Central and East European countries themselves also.    True, even now there is a difference in the approaches to  the  essence of this process. There is on the part of the alliance an  attempt to interpret this movement by use of the "NATO plus"  formula. It means that there is the NATO bloc, to which other  countries conforming to NATO standards--transparency of the  military budget and civilian control of the military  department--should affiliate. As a counterweight to this, Andrey  Kozyrev put forward at the NACC session his concept of the  association and cooperation under the aegis of the CSCE of all  leading regional organizations in the Euro-Atlantic space. The  Russian idea is that NATO, the CIS, the Western European Union,  the European Union, and such should become equal partners, among  whom no one would occupy a dominating position. And the  military-political and military-technical aspect of such  partnership should be secured by the North Atlantic Cooperation  Council, which, in Moscow's opinion, should be made an  independent organization with its own secretariat and other  support structures. Meanwhile, however, the NACC is a NATO lobby  for the North Atlantic bloc. And if some people, as the head of  the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry said in his speech at  the NACC session, "like to stand in the lobby and take the exam,  this is the sovereign right of each state." Russia, however,  will not do so. Answering the question of your NEZAVISIMAYA  GAZETA correspondent, Kozyrev emphasized that, on the other  hand, it would be stupid to refute the fact that NATO is a  structure that actually exists, and much that is useful could be  derived from cooperation with it. We can for this reason speak  about the conclusion of an agreement between NATO and each  individual country, and not an exclusive but complementary  version is possible on this level also, as are both at the same  time with the simultaneous strengthening of the structures of  the NACC, which, incidentally, is the Russian idea, which all  the delegations in Brussels greeted with interest. "The seed,"  Kozyrev said, "did not fall on stony ground."    There are far fewer disagreements at the practical programs  level. There is in the documents that were approved a  substantial set of specific forms of cooperation from joint  maneuvers through the training of peacekeeping forces. Even now  Russia's Northern Fleet is conducting exercises together with  NATO naval forces. In addition, as Boris Gromov, deputy minister  of defense of the Russian Federation, said in conversation with  your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent, an agreement between  Russia and NATO on joint military operations is being made ready  for signature at the present time. It is also contemplated  bringing the peacekeeping battalions in the former Yugoslavia,  Russian included, under the jurisdiction of NATO, under the  aegis of the United Nations, naturally, for greater efficacy.    Generally, following the Brussels meeting there have come to  be more conditions for cooperation. The Partnership for Peace  concept is blazing a trail for itself, for which much of the  credit goes to Russian diplomacy. Politicians expect a further  expansion of it from the top-level meetings scheduled for  January: of NATO in Brussels and of Boris Yeltsin and Bill  Clinton in Moscow.</p>

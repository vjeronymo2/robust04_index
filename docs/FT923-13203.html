			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Letter: Minimum reserves answer to German monetary expansion Sir, As German monetary expansion is purely a domestic phenomenon, the Bundesbank should pursue a policy that aims directly at its source, viz German bank credit. In addition, the bank should try to minimise adverse implications of its tight monetary policy for other EC countries. The solution to the dilemma is relatively simple. An increase in minimum reserve requirement rates will dampen bank credit expansion, without necessarily leading to increased money market interest rates. Therefore, one could suppose that a combination of an increase in minimum reserve requirement rates and a lower interest rate on the Bundesbank weekly repo tenders will tighten monetary conditions in Germany, while at the same time creating room for monetary easing elsewhere in Europe. Other Bundesbank measures (increasing the discount or Lombard rates, or limiting the discount or Lombard facility) will all lead to higher money market interest rates. As a result of the sharply inverted yield curve, this will lead to a further acceleration of M3 expansion, as investors move into high yielding short-term deposits. If the Bundesbank seriously wants to dampen monetary expansion, an increase in the minimum reserve requirement rates is the only measure that would make sense. If, however, the bank decides to raise interest rates once again on Thursday, one could suspect it of having a parallel agenda. Monetary policy could well be an instrument to lecture on central bank independency in Europe. Wim Boonstra, head of international research, Rabobank Nederland, Utrecht, Netherlands</p>

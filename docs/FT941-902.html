			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Ten commandments from the OECD The orthodox belief today is that something called structural reform is the key to improving performance, and to combining increased efficiency with lower unemployment. It usually means opening economies more to market forces. Yet such policies are difficult to write about in a way that excites attention. It becomes either a matter of general slogans, or a mass of industry and country detail of numbing boredom from which one cannot generalise. The secretariat of the 24-nation Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has thus performed a service in publishing an overall appraisal (Assessing Structural Reform: Lessons for the Future). It contains 10 lessons from experience, to give the subject a sharper focus. It is still not free of OECD-speak - perhaps the cloudy terminology is an attempt to avoid stirring up opposition from politicians who have made a career out of hostility to market forces. I can perform a slight service by translating the dialect. In what follows, the sentences in heavy type are the OECD's own words: 1. Lack of attention to incentives can lead to large costs. This means many kinds of intervention can create rewards for those who are ingenious in getting around them. For example, credit controls have been worn down by new non-bank institutions, falling outside the scope of the regulations, that have met customer needs. 2. Changed circumstances can turn reasonable policies into costly ones. In other words, a programme to buy off interest groups can become prohibitively expensive if circumstances change. The main example is agriculture. Competitors from outside Europe have depressed world prices and increased the cost of European farming support. 3. Delaying reform because of vested interests can increase transition costs. The longer you delay, the more interest groups become dependent on protection and the more expensive it is to buy them off. The US-Japan voluntary car export restraint agreement led to a transfer from American consumers to producers of Dollars 2.6bn in 1984. 4. International integration cannot be avoided and will help improve efficiency by inhibiting rent seeking and promoting competition. This mouthful means producers cannot reliably protect themselves by tariffs and quotas. Overseas competitors will usually get round them by direct investment, joint ventures and so on. In the meantime, because state aid has been concentrated in key sectors - such as agriculture, steel, shipbuilding and textiles - western economies have been given a perverse twist towards activities that should be fading into the sunset. 5. Adjustment costs need to be recognised. The costs of reform are concentrated on small, noisy groups and often come before the benefits. These groups often need to be, and sometimes even should be, bought off by social transfers. 6. Technological change may reduce the need for, or change the nature of, government intervention. A good example is telecommunications which are no longer natural monopolies because there are now so many ways of transmitting information; and in broadcasting, spectrum shortage has become a thing of the past. 7. Budget constraints can help avoid bad policies. Citizens' dislike of extra taxes is an effective obstacle to proliferating intervention. In the UK, the biggest inhibition on the Department of Trade and Industry from trying to back 'winners' and provide back-door subsidies is Treasury cash ceilings. Yet the OECD warns us not to rely too much on these constraints. Governments were able to get away with agricultural policies costing taxpayers and consumers Dollars 1,750bn between 1986 and 1991 partly because some costs did not appear in government budgets and were paid by consumers in prices well above world levels. 8. The service sector will increasingly be a focus for structural reform. Reform is particularly necessary because services are more sheltered from foreign trade than manufacturing; and differences between productivity in different countries are much bigger in some service sectors than in industry. 9. Non-economic factors can influence the nature and speed of reform. This refers to the need to sell free market reforms, which are not always immediately attractive to the electorate. Former New Zealand Labour prime minister David Lange did so in the 1980s by combining it with radical slogans about a non-nuclear south Pacific. Lady Thatcher did it in the UK with the almost opposite technique of allying free markets with national self-assertion. We shall soon know if Silvio Berlusconi has managed to sell a combination of free market reform, regional separatism and the lingering Italian desire for a strong leader. 10. There can be synergies between structural reform and macroeconomic environments. In times of prosperity, reforms will not be undertaken because there is no apparent need. In times of depression, they may be postponed to avoid unemployment. But if these obstacles can be overcome, structural reform can help macro-economic policies. For instance, if labour markets are flexible, pay and prices adjust more quickly to monetary squeezes, and inflation can then be cured more easily and at smaller cost in temporary unemployment. The OECD has still not discovered the secret of golden speech. Many of the examples could just as easily have gone into one category rather than another. But at least the attempt has been made.</p>

			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Management: False dawn for single market More than half of Britain's small business owners and managers remain unprepared for the full effects of the Single European Market, according to a survey* carried out by the Small Business Research Trust. Forty-four per cent believe they will not be affected by the completion of the single market, scheduled for December 31, while a further 11 per cent have not considered their position, the survey showed. Despite this continuing high level of unpreparedness, there has been a large increase in the number of owner-managers who have begun to prepare for change to 45 per cent compared with only 23 per cent in early 1990. Smaller companies, employing fewer than 10 people, appear to be most oblivious to the likely impact of the removal of trading barriers in Europe. Forty-three per cent of companies said their business was too local to be affected while 11 per cent did not believe that their industry would be affected. Ten per cent said they lacked enough information about developments while a further 10 per cent preferred to 'wait and see'. Small manufacturers of finished consumer or industrial goods and providers of consultancy or professional services were the most likely to have made preparations. This frequently took the form of seeking agents or distributors overseas or reviewing their business plans. Small business owners had increased their preparations, but only in the west Midlands had a majority of owners been actively preparing for the single market. Businesses in the north of England were most likely to see the single market as a threat while those in southern England were the most optimistic. *Small Business in the Big Market. By Colin Gray.

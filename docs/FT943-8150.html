			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / World Stock Market (South Africa): De Beers recovers by 3.4 per cent Local investors were active yesterday, encouraged by a positive reaction on the world's financial markets to the rise in US interest rates, which was announced late on Tuesday. With De Beers and Anglos leading the way, the overall index closed 61 up at 5,823, industrials added 41 at 6,610 and golds rose 42 to 2,152. Although the price of gold bullion firmed, strong renewed support for golds and mining financials was based mainly on the belief that the gold price was set to break out of its currently narrow trading range. De Beers recovered all of Tuesday's loss following its announcement of disappointing half-year results, rebounding R3.75, or 3.4 per cent, to R113.25. Anglos moved forward R5 to R256.50. In golds, Vaal Reefs rose R5 to R395.</p>

			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Aluminium slide dents recovery hopes HOPES THAT the recent strength of the aluminium and nickel markets might augur a world economic recovery were dented this week when prices of both metals fell sharply. Aluminium buyers, especially in the Far East, were still in full cry during the early part of the week and on Tuesday the London Metal Exchange cash price closed at a 5 1/2 -month high of Dollars 1,274 a tonne. But the failure of the three months position, which closed that day at Dollars 1,298.50 a tonne, to push on through the psychologically important Dollars 1,300 barrier signalled a change of sentiment and Far Eastern traders began to take their profits. As the cash price retreated to Dollars 1,221.50 a tonne at yesterday's close, down Dollars 28 on the week, dealers explained that the earlier sustained rise had created an 'overbought' market and a technical correction was overdue. The rise in LME warehouse stocks of aluminium continued - net deliveries amounted to 10,025 tonnes this week, taking the total to a record 1,055,875 tonnes - but the market appears to have become inured to this factor. Dealers noted yesterday that deliveries into the exchange's US warehouses had slowed to a trickle, keeping alive hopes that there was some improvement in American demand. But there was concern about a 1,500-tonne shipment into a Japanese warehouse. The nickel market's Dollars 690 upsurge since the start of this year had already run into stiff resistance at the end of last week, when the three months price failed to pass the Dollars 8,000-a-tonne mark. And this week saw a substantial retreat as the disappearance of recent influential buying allowed the negative fundamental situation to come to the fore. The bearishness of fundamentals was highlighted by a further 1,392-tonne rise in LME stocks to 17,916 tonnes, the highest level since September 1984. Dealers thought this week's rise largely reflected Russian deliveries into LME warehouses, and they said more was expected from that quarter. Another factor weighing on the nickel market was the prospect of a strike in the German steel industry, which it was feared would reduce demand from nickel's key end-use sector. But even before it was announced yesterday that steel workers in the IG Metall union had voted overwhelmingly in favour of striking in support of their 10.5 per cent pay claim the threat was beginning to lose its market potency. Dealers explained that the impact of a strike had already been discounted in this week's price fall and that, in any case, the overall supply/demand balance was not likely to be much affected because lost German output was likely to be made up by other European producers. The cash nickel price lost an early gain after the result of the strike vote was announced, finishing unchanged on the day at Dollars 7,665 a tonne, down Dollars 200 on the week. Zinc prices were also in retreat, as fears of a technical squeeze receded. The cash price fell Dollars 23.50 to Dollars 1,159 a tonne, and its premium over the three months price narrowed from Dollars 17 to Dollars 5.75 a tonne at one point, although it widened again yesterday to Dollars 13 a tonne. The week's biggest base metals rises were in the copper market, where the cash quotation gained Pounds 26.50 to Pounds 1,220.50 a tonne - but most of that reflected sterling's decline against the dollar. Also supportive of the copper market was the threat strike by Chilean miners over a plan for Codelco, the state-owned metals group, to grant controlling stakes in joint ventures to private companies. The company said, however, it was confident that a stoppage was 'highly improbable'. At the London Futures and Options Exchange the March robusta coffee price slid by another Pounds 61 to Pounds 505 a tonne. Dealers said sentiment was affected by news that Brazil, the biggest producer, had no market stabilisation proposals to put before next week's meeting of the International Coffee Organisation and that the National Coffee Growers' Federation of Colombia, the second biggest producer, was not even sending a delegation. The meetings will be attended instead by the federation's permanent representative in London. Coffee's weakness was also influenced by the evaporation of squeeze fears on the expiring January position, which went off the board quietly yesterday at a small discount to the March contract, now the only remaining sterling position.  -------------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close)  -------------------------------------------------- tonnes  -------------------------------------------------- Aluminium  +6,775   to   1,055,875 Copper     -7,725   to     305,575 Lead       +1,750   to     129,900 Nickel       +516   to      17,916 Zinc         +525   to     168,025 Tin          -125   to      13,600  --------------------------------------------------</p>

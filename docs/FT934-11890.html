			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / New wave of US mayors about to break MANY of the US's largest cities will wake up next week with new mayors after elections on Tuesday that could mark a changing of the guard among urban politicians. In the largest city holding an election this year, New York, Mr David Dinkins, the incumbent mayor, faces the same challenger he defeated four years ago, Mr Rudolph Giuliani. But in a dozen other big cities, incumbent mayors are retiring, bringing forward a new line-up of urban lead-ers. 'There is definitely a changing of the guard. Some of it is attitudinal, reflecting a pervasive desire for change in American politics, and some of it is generational,' says Mr David Bositis of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a Washington think-tank. A particularly notable shift is the departure of the first generation of black mayors in cities such as Detroit, where Mayor Coleman Young is standing down after 20 years in office, and Atlanta, where Mr Maynard Jackson first served as mayor in 1974 and returned four years ago for a final term. Younger black leaders, such as Mayor Freeman Bosley in St Louis or Mayor Mike White in Cleveland - who is up for re-election on Tuesday - have philosophies less deeply rooted in the experience of the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, Mr Bositis says, and may be more open to proposals such as bussing school pupils to ensure racially integrated schools. There is also an evident tendency for black candidates to come to the fore in cities where blacks do not make up the majority of the population; they are running not on the basis of race but on a mostly liberal policy platform. Following in the footsteps of Mr Bosley in St Louis or Mr Norm Rice, who is up for re-election in Seattle, Ms Sharon Sayles Belton, the current Minneapolis city council president, appears to be the leading candidate to succeed Mayor Donald Fraser, who is retiring after 14 years. If younger candidates are benefiting from a general desire to throw out the old politicians, similar to the wave ridden by Mr Ross Perot in last year's presidential elections, they will also find it difficult to do any better than their predecessors. A mayor's ability to deal with many of the dominant problems raised in this year's campaign, such as crime, is severely limited in the best of times, but particularly today, when virtually all cities face severe budget constraints.</p>

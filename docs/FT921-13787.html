			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / India axes price controls on steel INDIA has abolished controls on the price of steel, signalling its intention to press ahead with an economic reform programme, writes K K Sharma in New Delhi. The impact of higher prices will be softened by the lowering of import duties, by 20 to 25 per cent, on a wide range of steel products, particularly on steel melting scrap and billets used by rolling mills.</p>

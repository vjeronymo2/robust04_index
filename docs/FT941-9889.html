			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Qatar gas export project ends over price dispute One of Qatar's big three gas export projects has collapsed because of a price dispute with Italian customers, Qatari sources said, Reuter reports from Manama. The government's Qatar General Petroleum Corporation is taking over the shares of its two western partners in Qatar Europe LNG Company (Eurogas), forcing a rethink of how to proceed, said Eurogas chairman Abdul-Aziz al-Dulaimi. The agreement collapsed because Qatar could not agree with the 30 per cent shareholder, Italy's state-owned Snam, on how much it should pay for the gas. QGPC is taking over Snam's share as well as the 5 per cent held by the US company, Nelson Bunker Hunt. Eurogas was one of three huge liquefied natural gas projects Qatar had planned to cash in on its North Field reserves and diversify from reliance on oil. It was to have exported 6.1m tonnes LNG a year. But construction work has not started and there have been no exports, although North Field gas is used in local industry. The project - to have cost at least Dollars 5bn with one estimate running as high as Dollars 8bn - could not proceed at least for now without being assured of Snam's purchases, though other European customers were being pursued, the sources said. One option being considered is to expand the other two LNG projects if demand merits it. Technically this is possible though commercially it is complicated because of existing shareholding and marketing agreements. 'We in QGPC are rethinking the whole gas market scheme and the projects we have, certainly on the European side,' a Qatari official said. 'As far as Qatar is concerned, we will continue to pursue the European market.' The memorandum of understanding under which Eurogas was set up in 1992 stipulated that the two sides had to agree by the end of 1993 on matters such as pricing, Mr Dulaimi said. That agreement was not forthcoming, with the consequence that QGPC becomes the sole owner, he said after the Eurogas board met on Wednesday. 'If the parties failed to reach an agreement by the end of December (1993), the agreement is nul. In this case the shares go to QGPC,' Mr Dulaimi said. Snam, which benefits from relatively cheap Algerian gas at the price of Dollars 2.50-Dollars 2.60 per million BTU, had objected to the price it would have had to pay for the Qatari LNG. It had also failed to win improved Suez Canal transit fees.</p>

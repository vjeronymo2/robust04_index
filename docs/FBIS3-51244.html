The presidential candidacy of Professor Ruben Dario Carles  became official this afternoon. The conventions of the Civic  Renewal Party first and the National Renewal Movement [Morena]  later approved Carles' nomination by a majority vote. Here are  the details:    During its convention today, Civic Renewal nominated Ruben  Dario Carles as its presidential candidate. The ticket will  include Dr. Gloria Moreno de Lopez as first vice president and  Dr. Tomas Herrera as second vice president.    The convention, which began this morning, was suspended for  an hour, because convention delegates could not agree on two  vice presidents. Civic Renewal insisted that its president,  Tomas Herrera, should be the first vice president; it was  explained later that Carles himself chose his running mates.    Tomas Herrera accepted the nomination for second vice  president and asked the delegates to support him, citing the  need for unity against the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party]  ticket. With Herrera's acceptance, Civic Renewal approved the  presidential ticket in an open vote. After the results were  disclosed, former political adversaries Ruben Dario Carles and  Gloria Moreno de Lopez arrived at the convention together.    [Begin Carles recording] Following 21 years of dictatorship,  we have not yet rid ourselves of the bad habits and corruption  imposed on our country by the military, which is now attempting  to return. [end recording]    After Civic Renewal nominated him as presidential candidate,  former comptroller Carles went to the Morena convention at the  Atlapa Convention Center. Amid shouts of: Carles for President,  Morena's convention delegates unanimously supported Carles'  presidential candidacy with Gloria Moreno de Lopez as first vice  president and Tomas Herrera as second vice president.    The 76 convention delegates agreed to form an alliance with  Civic Renewal and open negotiations with other parties. During  his speech, Carles said that over the past few weeks he has  focused on preparing his political platform.    [Begin Carles recording, in progress] ...while others  elbowed, punched, and kneed each other [applause] to win a  nomination and others cast unjustified insults at people who  were entitled to civic nominations, I have traveled throughout  the countryside to update the information I had. [end recording]    The government platform of the Carles-Moreno de  Lopez-Herrera  ticket broaches such issues as the improvement of public  services, the Canal's operation, and how the reverted areas will  be used.    Meanwhile, Molirena [Nationalist Liberal Republican  Movement]  elected today its convention delegates throughout the country.  The 1,040 elected delegates will decide the course the party  will take in the forthcoming May elections. In most of the  provinces the delegates were elected by sole consensus lists,  except in the city of Santiago, where there are two lists, and  Colon Province, where the delegate positions were disputed by  factions split between Jaime Ford and Legislator Alonso  Fernandez.    The Molirena elections, which went normally, were attended  by  20 percent of party members. Molirena's convention is scheduled  for 23 January, when the delegates will decide whether to  nominate Ruben Dario Carles or Guillermo Ford.</p>

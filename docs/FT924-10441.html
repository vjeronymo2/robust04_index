The settlement, approved by a Denver court, is with shareholders of MiniScribe and the company's bankruptcy estate. The settlement is understood to bring to at least Dollars 140m Coopers' payments for MiniScribe related claims, since it has already agreed to pay Dollars 40m - Dollars 50m in a suit brought by bondholders in Texas.

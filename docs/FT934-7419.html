			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / International Company News: Renault earnings down by 86% at nine months THE DEPRESSED European car market led to an 86 per cent fall in nine-month pre-tax profits at Renault despite reduced interest payments and a strong contribution from financial subsidiaries. Pre-tax profits amounted to FFr1.03bn (Dollars 174m), compared with FFr7.51bn a year earlier. The fall in the first six months continued through the third quarter. Nine-month sales were FFr124.19bn, down 8.3 per cent. Renault warned of continued gloomy prospects for the car market. 'The European car and truck markets do not at present show any indication that a recovery might materialise between now and the end of the year,' the company said. However, motor industry analysts said Renault was coping better with the fall in demand than most of its rivals. 'Renault is still in profit,' said one analyst. adding that the sharp fall was partly a reflection of the record 1992 profits. Renault made no comment yesterday about its merger plans with Volvo. But it said that existing shareholdings in the Swedish group's car and truck operations made a loss of FFr344m in the nine months compared with a deficit of FFr478m last year. Renault said despite the 15.4 per cent contraction in the European car market in the nine months it had maintained its market share at 10.5 per cent. The nine-month results included exceptional charges of FFr728m, largely comprising restructuring costs but not including charges relating to plans to cut 1,423 jobs at RVI, the truck and bus operation.</p>

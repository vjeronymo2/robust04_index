			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 22 Apr (XINHUA) -- Zhu Li, secretary  general of the China Securities Supervision and Administration  Committee, today told a XINHUA reporter: With the State  Council's approval, the State Council's General Office recently  relayed the State Council Securities Commission's six-point  concrete opinion on halting futures trading in steel products,  sugar, and coal:    1. Standardized futures contract trading in steel products  and sugar will be halted. Exchanges already engaged in futures  trading in steel products and sugar will stop issuing futures  contracts after the end of October. Trading under contracts for  current futures trading will be allowed to continue until the  day of settlement.    2. Trading under nonstandardized, long-term contacts may be  continued; however, illegal sales of contracts at a profit to  increase prices indirectly will be strictly prohibited.    3. It is suggested that the Ministry of Coal Industry issue  a  circular urging all coal exchanges and wholesale markets to stop  designing and listing standardized futures contracts for coal  varieties.    4. From now on, no exchanges will be allowed to decide on  their own to list new futures varieties. The listing of any new  variety must be reported to the China Securities Supervision and  Administration Committee for examination and approval after its  justification is fully proven.    5. No banking institution may issue letters of guarantee  regarding futures trading. All futures exchanges are forbidden  to accept bank-issued letters of guarantee for use as cash  deposits.    6. When futures prices fluctuate drastically, the China  Securities Supervision and Administration Committee may ask  exchanges to raise the proportion of cash deposits to those  prices.    Zhu Li said: The State Council's General Office urges  people's governments in all localities and relevant departments  to follow and implement the foregoing opinion, and to actively  but steadily carry out work arising from its issuance to ensure  social stability and the normal performance of various economic  tasks.</p>

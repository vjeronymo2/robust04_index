			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, June 3 (AFP) -- The United Nations Friday  [3 June] warned it would cancel scheduled peace talks on  Saturday if Bosnian Serb forces did not fully withdraw from  around Gorazde in eastern Bosnia.    Talks on a truce should have begun here Thursday, but  Bosnian  Moslems refused to attend so long as Bosnian Serbs continued to  occupy the UN-declared exclusion zone around Gorazde from which  they had promised to pull out.</p>

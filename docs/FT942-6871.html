			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Government Bonds: European sector returns to calmer waters Europe's bond markets returned to calmer waters after the recent days' turbulence, but traders said sentiment was nervous and market participants were too shell-shocked to take significant positions. 'The market is shaky - it's hanging in a very delicate balance,' said Mr Peter Kerger, head of futures and options at NatWest Markets in Frankfurt. After Wednesday's sell-off, which sent the German bund future plunging to its year's low, prices clawed back some of their losses, helped by a firmer tone in the US Treasuries market, but the recovery was without conviction, traders said. One said dealers at some banks had been instructed not to run positions overnight, and to keep intra-day positions to a minimum. The June bund future ended the day some 0.20 points higher at 93.75. It derived little comfort from preliminary inflation numbers showing western Germany's cost of living below the 3 per cent level for the first time in three years at 2.9 per cent. 'After recent regional data, this came as no surprise,' said a dealer. Bearish sentiment continued to dominate the UK government bond market yesterday, although it recovered in later trading - buoyed by the recovery in US and German markets. Analysts said traders continued to test new low levels of technical support but one trader said the weakness, particularly at the long end, was caused by the release of 'a substantial line, probably in excess of Pounds 200m nominal, of very long-dated stock on to the market'. Other traders reported fairly heavy selling of gilts of all types. After opening slightly higher, gilts slipped back through the levels reached yesterday to new lows, analysts said. They recovered in late trading, when the long gilt future was up  1/4 point at 103 9/16 . Sweden was Europe's only bright patch. Bonds and the currency rallied smartly after the central bank announced a new system for steering short-term interest rates based on a repo rate, rather than its current key marginal rate. The Riksbank set the repo rate at 6.95 per cent, five basis points below the previous marginal lending rate, and the floor rate at 6 per cent. At a press briefing, Riksbank governor Mr Urban Backstrom said the level of the floor, or deposit, rate indicated that 'the (interest rate) trend is still downwards'. 'They now have much more scope to cut rates in small dribbling moves,' said Mr Keld Holm, international economist at Lehman Brothers. He expects short rates to fall by around 50 basis points in coming months, which is likely to boost bonds and the krona, he said. US Treasury bonds were mixed yesterday as the market failed to build on gains struck after the previous afternoon's successful supply auction. Late in the day the 30-year bond dipped  1/8 to 86 23/32 , with the yield rising to 7.355 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was unchanged at 99 29/32 , to yield 5.909 per cent. Early in the session, activity was light and sporadic, with many traders on the sidelines ahead of the holiday weekend. A flurry of buying followed the announcement that initial claims for unemployment benefit had slipped by 1,000 last week. Forecasts had centred on a decline of 7,000, which would have signalled a tighter labour market and more upward pressure on wages. But the activity quickly petered out, as the market digested an upturn in prices following Wednesday's Treasury auction of Dollars 11bn in new five-year notes. Traders had anticipated difficulty in absorbing the fresh supply but when those fears proved unfounded, the market rallied. Yesterday, however, profit-takers came to the fore, even though there was more favourable news from the Commodity Research Bureau. Its index of 21 commodity prices receded further, after a disconcerting surge late last week.</p>

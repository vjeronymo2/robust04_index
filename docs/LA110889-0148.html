			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> SOVIETS WEAK ON GEOGRAPHY TOO  </P> <P> Americans and Soviets have at least one thing in common -- many don't know much  geography and show "an astonishing lack of awareness of the world around them,"  a Gallup poll showed today.  </P> <P> In the first survey of geographic knowledge conducted in the Soviet Union,  young Soviets scored significantly higher than their American counterparts but  didn't do well when contrasted with adults of all age groups in the 10 nations  where the test was given.  </P> <P> For example, Soviets between ages 18 and 24 correctly identified an average of  9.3 of 16 locations on a world map, ranking fourth along with Canadians and  Italians. Young American adults came in last, with an average of 6.9 correct.  </P></p>

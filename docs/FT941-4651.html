			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Observer: Seitz on commerce Perhaps Ray Seitz, the US Ambassador to the Court of St James, isn't going to quit Britain after all. He's due to relinquish his post in the early summer, and will most likely be replaced by admiral Bill Crowe. But it seems Seitz, a career diplomat with 28 years' experience, has all but decided against returning to the State Department. Like several of his predecessors, he has come to like London, and there is no obvious big job for him to go to in Washington. If Seitz wanted to stay in the UK, he wouldn't be short of job offers. Still only 53, he has a contact book which would make him a natural non-executive director for a company with big US interests. Charlie Price, a former US ambassador, went on the boards of Hanson and British Airways. If he wanted a proper job, he could go into consulting, become a City merchant banker, or try his hand at international trouble shooting for a big company like GEC. Alternatively, if money is no object, then Seitz might consider following in the footsteps of a predecessor, Kingman Brewster, who went on to head University College, Oxford. Come to think of it, he might make a good figurehead for Oxford's new Institute of American Studies.</p>

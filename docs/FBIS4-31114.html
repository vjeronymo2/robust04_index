			<p>BFN     [Text] Ljubljana, 3 Jun (TANJUG) -- Slovene Prime Minister  Janez Drnovsek has warned the Croatian leadership that Slovenia  will make "some political moves" unless Zagreb accepts  Ljubljana's demands for the resolution of the problem of the  state border between the two former Yugoslav republics.    The Croatian Government last night rejected the Slovene  Foreign Ministry's proposal that Slovenia take over full control  of the Bay of Piran, and Croatia continue the building of the  Secovje border crossing near Portoroz. On this occasion,  Drnovsek threatened to cancel the official visit of Slovene  President Milan Kucan to Croatia and place the Secovje border  crossing down the list of priorities.    Despite the claims of Prime Minister Drnovsek that Slovenia  is opposed to a further exacerbation of relations, the official  cancellation of Kucan's visit to Zagreb, scheduled for 7 June,  is expected soon. The failure of the Slovene president to  depart for Zagreb would represent yet another diplomatic clash  between Ljubljana and Zagreb, which until recently were firm  allies, and mutual relations would fall to an ever lower level.</p>

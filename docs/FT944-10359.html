			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Yeltsin aide attacks budget The battle between President Boris Yeltsin and his prime minister, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, which has been waged through proxies over the past week in a prolonged cabinet shuffle, was stepped up yesterday when a senior presidential adviser attacked Mr Chernomyrdin's austere 1995 budget. Mr Alexander Livshits, a recently appointed Yeltsin adviser who was described by one Russian newspaper yesterday as more influential than any cabinet minister, told a press conference that the budget was too tough. 'The price of implementing such a budget will be too high,' Mr Livshits said. 'I don't think the end justifies the means.' Mr Livshits criticised the government's proposal to put a moratorium on the soft central bank credits which pushed the monthly inflation rate up to 15 per cent in October. He said the government's plan to raise money through bonds, which have recently experienced poor demand despite rapidly rising prices, was unrealistic. Mr Livshits said long-term plans to slash inflation to western levels were unrealistic. 'I see no reason why we should not have 15 to 20 per cent inflation a year in the next few years,' he said. When the cabinet endorsed it last month, the austere budget was hailed as a sign that Russia was at last prepared to swallow the tough fiscal and monetary medicine which has turned around the economies of eastern Europe. But it could be derailed by Mr Yeltsin's covert criticisms and the even stiffer resistance it is expected to face when it is presented to parliament later this year.</p>

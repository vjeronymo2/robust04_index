Last Friday the president would not appoint him to  Waldemar Pawlak's government.    [Rosati] "Having been faced with the decision made by the  president, I intend to withdraw my candidacy. I am only waiting  for the possibility of having a conversation with Prime Minister  Pawlak and Chairman Kwasniewski. I want to inform them about my  intention to withdraw as a candidate for the post of deputy  prime minister and minister of finance, and I would like to hear  their opinions on the subject."    [Announcer] Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak and Aleksander  Kwasniewski, Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] leader, after a  one-hour meeting, decided that Dariusz Rosati would remain the  coalition candidate for the vacant posts. Initially, we  obtained this information unofficially because the left-wing  leader [Kwasniewski] left the Council of Ministers' Office by a  different gate from the one where journalists were waiting for  him. Later, in the Sejm, Aleksander Kwasniewski locked himself  in his office. In the end, not seeing any other possibility of  avoiding talking to media representatives, he left the Sejm  through a window.    Later, however, the leader of the Left answered some  questions from journalists.    [Kwasniewski] "He is still, I say it clearly, the candidate  of the prime minister and the SLD. There will be talks held on  this issue shortly. We will see what transpires."    [Unidentified correspondent] "Who will the talks be with?"    [Kwasniewski] "The president, of course."    [Correspondent] We asked Dariusz Rosati if it is possible,  after a conversation with the coalition leaders, he would change  his mind and continue as the candidate for the government.    [Rosati] "Theoretically, one can imagine such a development  of the situation and such a fundamental change of circumstances  that would allow me to remain the candidate. But, let us be  honest, such a development of the situation is very unlikely. I  cannot imagine a situation in which the minister of finance and  deputy prime minister responsible for economic affairs would be  in conflict with the president."    [Correspondent] "Have you considered the possibility of  withdrawing Mr. Rosati's candidacy and naming Mr. Paga [head of  the Securities Commission] as a candidate?"    [Kwasniewski] "No, we will not withdraw Mr. Rosati's  candidacy."    [Correspondent] "Do you consider Mr. Paga suitable?"    [Kwasniewski] "We will not withdraw Mr. Rosati's candidacy."</p>

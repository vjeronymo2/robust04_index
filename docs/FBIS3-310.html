			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Pierre Claassen] </F>   [Excerpts] Cape Town March 3 SAPA -- International  mediation and the government's attitude to it has become the key  to a quick and inclusive constitutional settlement. This became  clear as the Freedom Alliance closed ranks on Thursday [3 March]  and backed the mediation initiative proposed by IFP [Inkatha  Freedom Party] leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi with the African  National Congress' [ANC] national working committee also giving  it the green light.    The proposal, made at the Buthelezi/Mandela summit on  Tuesday, now needs only the government's backing to ensure  agreement by the majority in the multiparty negotiating process.  [passage omitted]    Mr F W de Klerk and his government will now have to give its  response to the mediation proposal, an option not popular with  the NP [National Party] government in the past. An  all-inclusive settlement has, however, become a clear priority  for the two major parties and there seems little chance,  observers say, that Mr de Klerk will resist ANC President Nelson  Mandela in accepting it. The Angola/Namibian settlement is  cited as a clear precedent of successful international mediation  involving South Africa.    The Alliance backing came after a three-hour meeting between  leaders at a Constantia Hotel in the Cape on Friday morning.  Speaking on their behalf, Alliance Chairman and Bophuthatswana  Foreign Minister Rowan Cronje said they were backing the  intiative and were united on the issue. It was up to the ANC to  indicate its acceptance of the offer.    Mr Buthelezi said the offer was made in return for a  recommendation to his Central Committee to register  "provisionally" to give negotiators a chance to find a  settlement. He rejected Mr de Klerk's view, expressed in  Parliament on Wednesday, that negotiations could continue to  reach agreements which could be implemented after the elections.  "We want a settlement before elections," he said.    The Alliance accused the government of having unilaterally  suspended negotiations, but the new initiative has given the  process new momentum which the government will find difficult to  resist.    Mr de Klerk acknowledged the IFP offer in Parliament on  Wednesday with careful wording which clearly left the door open.    Asked whether there was enough time, Mr Cronje said at the  Thursday summit the principle first had to be accepted before  details of the who, where and when could be negotiated. He made  it clear the Alliance was taking its cue from the IFP Central  Committee's decision on Friday which in turn was subject to ANC  acceptance.    Mr Buthelezi's response was that if the IFP Central  Committee  accepted the initiative it was implicit that it considered there  was enough time to negotiate and participate in the elections,  although the Alliance and the IFP's position remained that the  election date itself had to be postponed. Although there is  virtually no chance of the latter, senior negotiators said on  Thursday night a concession by the government and the ANC on  international mediation was now a logical next step.  Postponements of technical deadlines could then follow.    The Alliance was confident enough to appoint a committee to  deal with the details of such a process once the IFP's Central  Committee decided in favour of it.</p>

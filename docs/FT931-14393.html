			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Intellectual property rights explained - In A Nutshell Intellectual property rights can be among the most valuable assets of a business but their importance is often overlooked because they are intangible. A guide to the legal issues has been prepared by solicitors Baileys Shaw &amp; Gillett. Some rights, such as patents, must be formally registered but others, including copyright and trade or service marks, arise automatically. They are valuable because they can be used to establish a competitive advantage or because they can be sold or licensed to produce royalties.

			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Labour attacks water profits The Labour party yesterday launched a new broadside against the profits made by privatised water companies in England and Wales, in spite of recent assurances from the industry regulator that consumer costs would be kept within strict limits. In a detailed attack on the activities of the 31 privatised water companies, Mr George Howarth, shadow environment minister, said their overall profits had risen 125 per cent since privatisation in 1989 and that the salaries of their chairmen had risen an average 135 per cent over the same period. He also said that about a third of the water companies' chairmen held senior posts in other companies which were benefactors of the Conservative party, and had donated a total of Pounds 745,000 to Tory funds in the past 15 years. Mr Howarth said, for example, that Mr Andrew Simon, the director of Severn Trent Water, was also a director of Laporte, the chemicals group, which has donated Pounds 231,200 since 1979. Mr Howarth said he was not alleging any impropriety. 'The point is that when all these interests get so closely snuggled up together the borderline between the various public interests, private interests and the Conservative party itself becomes blurred,' he said. The Gas Consumers Council has asked the government to restrict British Gas's ability to increase prices to some of its customers before the introduction of competition in the domestic market, Robert Corzine writes. In a letter to Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, the council accused British Gas of mounting 'an intensive campaign to warn that higher gas bills, for some, are an unavoidable prelude to competition'. Last month British Gas said it intended to remove cross-subsidies between the 18m household consumers of gas in a process known as 're-balancing'. It claimed that 2m to 3m of its best customers subsidised many more millions of consumers who either use small amounts of gas or who are problem payers.</p>

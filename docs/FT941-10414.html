			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / International Bonds: Abbey National in Dollars 1bn FRN offer Floating rate notes were the flavour of the day in the international bond market once again, as Friday's quarter-point rise in US short-term interest rates continued to stimulate investor interest in this particular sector. Looking ahead, syndicate officials said the market was preparing for a handful of large global straight bond issues, including a Dollars 750m deal for the National Bank of Hungary and a Dollars 750m offering for the Asian Development Bank. Abbey National launched a Dollars 1bn five-year FRN with a coupon of three-month Libor minus 6.25 basis points. The bonds were priced at 99.71 to give a yield of three-month Libor, currently quoted at 3 1/2 -3 9/16 per cent. Mr Jonathan Nicholls, Abbey's director of corporate finance and capital markets, said the Fed's move had provided an obvious opportunity to do a floating rate issue, adding that investor demand for FRNs has been strong in recent months. Goldman Sachs, lead manager for the deal, said it had wanted to bring a large, liquid FRN issue at around Libor to take advantage of fund manager appetite for floating rate dollars. The lead manager said it had seen renewed demand for Canada's recent Dollars 2bn five-year FRN deal, which convinced it that a large deal for Abbey would work. In pricing the Abbey deal, Goldman said it looked at recent FRN issues such as the Dollars 2bn issue from Province of Ontario which currently offers a yield of Libor plus 7 basis points. However, other syndicate managers remarked that the pricing on the Abbey deal was 'very tight'. The bonds will break syndicate today The sterling sector saw plenty of excitement, reflecting the volatile conditions in the underlying UK government bond market. The quarter-point cut in the UK base rate first thing in the day sent gilt prices as much as a point higher in the morning and made the launch of certain sterling deals more difficult. As a result of the base rate cut, Baring Brothers decided not to use the fixed price re-offer system for the Pounds 100m, five-year Eurobond deal which it brought for IKB Finance, the German bank which specialises in lending to medium-sized industries. Also in the sterling sector, De Beers Centenary, the Lucerne-registered part of the De Beers group which holds all of the non-South African interests, launched its first bond issue. The bond proceeds will be used partly to repay some of the company's short and medium-term borrowings, and partly to augment existing facilities. The Pounds 150m 15-year deal has a coupon of 8.25 per cent and offers a yield of 165 basis points over the 9 per cent gilt due 2008. The issue, which was aimed predominantly at UK investors, had a launch price of 98.973 and traded up to 99.00-99.25 by late afternoon.</p>

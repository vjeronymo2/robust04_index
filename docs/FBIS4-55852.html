			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, May 23 (TANJUG) -- Serbia's underground  coal mines will probably have to shut down unless they receive  bank loans for emergency purchases of raw materials and  semi-manufactures. In May, eight mines, which ordered and  received six tonnes of explosives, were notified there would be  no further deliveries until the mine managements settled  oustanding debts with the explosives manufacturers, TANJUG  learns at the Serbian Chamber of Commerce.    Most of the mines have had to go back to manual operation  and  minimum use of equipment. In order to maintain the output, they  would have to invest about 135 million dollars in technical  improvement this and the following year. Negotiations with  bankers are underway, but it is still uncertain whether they  will aprove the credits, the Chamber of Commerce says.    According to the targeted energy output for 1994, Serbia's  underground mines are expected to produce 760,000 tonnes of  coal, and open-pit mines a further 31,6 million tonnes. It is  highly certain now that this year's coal production will hardly  reach the expected demand, which is usually at its peak in  September. Since the Serbian power industry has conducted  minimal power network overhauls over the past three years, the  grid will hardly endure an increased load in winter.    Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) has had to become  self-reliant  in power production since the U.N. Security Council imposed  tough sanctions against it in late May of 1992. The embargo  also includes a ban on crude oil deliveries.</p>

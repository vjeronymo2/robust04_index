			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> WILLIE WOOD FINALLY FALTERS, FALLS INTO TIE  </P> <P> As next-door neighbors and college teammates, Willie Wood and Bob Tway played a  lot of rounds of golf together.  </P> <P> As co-leaders heading into today's final round of the Hardee's Golf Classic at  Coal Valley, Ill., they'll play one more.  </P> <P> "I don't know how many hundreds of rounds we've played together," Wood said  after he double-bogeyed No. 18 to fall back into the tie with his Oklahoma City  neighbor and Oklahoma State teammate at 199, 11 under.  </P> <P> Two shots back were second-round leader Billy Mayfair, first-round leader Jeff  Sluman, Jim Gallagher Jr. and Jay Delsing. Mayfair had a 71, Delsing a 70,  Gallagher a 67 and Sluman a 65 at the Oakwood Country Club course.  </P> <P> Wood was cruising toward his second consecutive bogey-free round before he hit  his tee shot on the final hole out of bounds and had to settle for a two-under  68.  </P> <P> Tway, who carded a third-round 67, said if he couldn't win the $180,000 first  prize, he hoped Wood did.  </P> <P> "I'm pleased to see him playing well," Tway said.  </P> <P> "He has been more successful than I," said Wood, looking for his first title  after more than six years on the Tour.  </P> <P> Early this year, Tway tied for fifth at Phoenix and tied for seventh at the Bob  Hope Classic.  </P> <P> A total of 23 golfers are within five shots of the lead.  </P> <P> Gallagher beat Mayfair in a playoff for last weekend's Greater Milwaukee Open  title and the two will be together again in one of today's threesomes.  </P> <P> Dennis Harrington got the first hole in one of the tournament when he used a  six-iron on the 174-yard No. 12.  </P> <P> Defending champion Rives McBee finished with an eagle to shoot a five-under 67  for a two-stroke lead in the Senior Tour event at Lexington, Ky.  </P> <P> McBee, who won his first Seniors event in the 1989 tournament, birdied No. 17  before the eagle on the 531-yard final hole on the Kearney Hill Golf Links. He  had a 36-hole total of 133, 11 under.  </P> <P> Quinton Gray shot a 67 to stay two strokes behind McBee. Lee Trevino pulled  into contention with a 66, and is at 137.  </P> <P> Nick Faldo overcame wrist problems with a six-under-par 64 to move two shots  behind Gordon Brand in the European Open golf championship at Sunningdale,  England.  </P> <P> Brand, from England, shot a 65 to give him a one-stroke edge over Welshman Ian  Woosnam, Jose Maria Canizares of Spain and Australian Peter Senior.  </P> <P> Pat Bradley shot a 68 to take a one-stroke lead in the LPGA event at Portland,  Ore. Bradley is at six-under 138, one up on Dottie Mochrie and Sherri Turner.  </P></p>

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Lloyd's considers option on capital Plans to allow Lloyd's syndicates to obtain all their capital from one single corporate investor - in effect becoming insurance companies - are being considered by the insurance market. More details are likely to emerge today when Lloyd's unveils a report on ways in which it can strengthen the market's capital base. It will say how hard-pressed Names - the individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the market - can share in the capital value or goodwill attached to Lloyd's business. The report follows work by an advisory group of senior market professionals, 'the value group', led by Mr Robert Hiscox, Lloyd's deputy chairman. The committee was established to consider further reforms to the market's capital structure following the decision to allow limited corporate investment in syndicates. The plans would make it easier for Names to opt for limited-liability investment. Institutional investors have already invested Pounds 800m in Lloyd's syndicates and account for about 15 per cent of the market's total capacity  -the amount of premium income that can be accepted by syndicates. At present corporate investors can control no more than 50 per cent of a syndicate's capacity, while no single corporate investor can control more than 25 per cent. The report is expected to outline a number of ways in which Names could 'assign' their participations in syndicates in exchange for shares or other securities, which might make Names shareholders in the new corporate Names and cap their liability. Lloyd's is also expected to continue its work on setting up a market for Names to buy and sell participations. The report is also expected to make recommendations on how Lloyd's could introduce pre-emption rights for Names. These would be similar to pre-emption rights attached to shares in a company. This would allow Names to maintain their existing participations in syndicates or increase them in line with any rise in a syndicate's capacity.</p>

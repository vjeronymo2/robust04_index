			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JARUZELSKI SWORN IN AS POLISH PRESIDENT;  </P> <P> COMMUNIST PARTY LEADER WINS POST WITHOUT A VOTE TO SPARE  </P> <P> Communist Party leader Wojciech Jaruzelski was sworn in as Poland's new  president Wednesday night after winning election in the National Assembly  without a single vote to spare.  </P> <P> "I accept," Gen. Jaruzelski said upon arriving before the packed chamber to be  officially informed of the result.  </P> <P> "I want to be a president of reconciliation, a representative of all Poles," he  said, without referring to the narrowness of the victory or the last swipe  taken by the opposition, which took pains to put on record that Jaruzelski had  won the minimum number of votes necessary.  </P> <P> The vote was 270 for Jaruzelski, 233 against and 34 abstaining. With a total of  537 valid votes cast, the lawmakers initially declared that 269 were required  to win. After some debate, led by opposition Solidarity lawmakers, the assembly  voted to declare that 270 votes was the minimum.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Trace of Malice  </P> <P> This numerical fine-tuning had more than a trace of malice in it. But to  Solidarity members and many Poles who watched the eight-hour procedure on  television, it was a last protest against Jaruzelski and the current hybrid  political system -- almost free, but not quite -- that presented only one  choice to lawmakers.  </P> <P> Some of those who abstained, in fact, announced that they were withholding  their votes as a protest against an election with just one candidate.  </P> <P> The National Assembly, composed of the Sejm and the newly created Senate, spent  nearly two hours on a series of motions to decide whether the vote would be  taken by secret ballot or an open roll call.  </P> <P> "We're sinking in procedural matters," argued one lawmaker, trying to sort out  the welter of overlapping motions.  </P> <P> "It's getting a bit chaotic," agreed Sejm Speaker Mikolaj Kozakiewicz.  </P> <P> In the end, a compromise was reached in which the lawmakers marked ballots that  were dropped, one by one, in a box on the rostrum as the names were called. The  votes of individual members, it was agreed, are to be published. (In one motion  before the floor, only the leaders of the various parties would be informed as  to how members voted, which prompted Solidarity activist Adam Michnik to  comment that such a provision would not prevent the "secret police from knowing  how we voted.")  </P> <P> Given the closeness of the vote, an open roll call would have provided millions  of television viewers with one of the most dramatic spectacles in Polish  political history -- and might well have altered the outcome.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Riveting Theater  </P> <P> Even so, it was riveting theater, as television cameras hovered over the table  where parliamentary secretaries counted, sorted, stacked and then recounted the  ballots. Dozens of newly elected senators and Sejm deputies crowded at the  rostrum rail over the counting table, watching the tally.  </P> <P> "I state that citizen Wojciech Jaruzelski has received the required number of  votes and has been elected by the National Assembly to be president of the  Polish People's Republic," Kozakiewicz said after the count was completed.  </P> <P> Kozakiewicz and Senate Speaker Andrzej Stelmachowski then went to Jaruzelski's  office to escort him to the National Assembly building.  </P> <P> Jaruzelski, 66, in a blue suit and his familiar tinted glasses, made a low-key  speech, noting that the nation had embarked on a "crucial period of change" and  that "the attention of the world is focused on Poland."  </P> <P> "We face great demands and tasks," he said. "We must rebuild our economy. We  have to assemble a new political order."  </P> <P> He concluded: "I will serve the nation. I will serve the fatherland, the one  that has not perished, the one that is and will be."  </P> <P> Jaruzelski's election came after nearly three weeks of uncertainty. On June 30,  after it appeared that some of the Communist coalition's partners were hesitant  in their support, he withdrew from the race, saying that most of the public  identified him more with the 1981 imposition of martial law and the suppression  of Solidarity than with the government's reform track over the last two years.  </P> <P> However, the party's rank and file quickly realized after Jaruzelski's  withdrawal that it had no acceptable alternative. After two weeks of hard  consideration and political arm twisting, the Communist allies in the Peasants'  Party and the Democratic Party somewhat reluctantly came along.  </P> <P> In fact, Jaruzelski's close scrape in the election was not foreseen in April,  when "round-table" agreements were concluded between Solidarity and the  government. Although it was not a formal part of the arrangement, the labor  union and the government side agreed that Jaruzelski would be president. The  threat to that arrangement came from the party's once-reliable friends,  urgently looking for a way out of what they perceive as a sinking political  ship.  </P> <P> With his stern face and erect military bearing, Jaruzelski projects an air of  strong pride, reflected in an interview last month in which he declared that "I  will not crawl for this job."  </P> <P> In the end, however, he did campaign for the presidency within the political  parties of the Sejm, even meeting Tuesday with the Solidarity delegation for  six grueling hours of questioning.  </P> <P> Many of those questions centered on the martial-law declaration and the  accompanying arrests and crackdown on civil liberties. And the overwhelming  majority of the Solidarity delegation is equally critical about Jaruzelski's  leadership in the years since, during which, it is argued, Poland's economic  slide continued unabated.  </P> <P> For Jaruzelski, the presidency is the culmination of his career and offers a  chance for him to enter Polish history as a figure more positive than the  commissar of martial law, a step that his supporters contend saved the nation  from a Soviet invasion.  </P> <P> Jaruzelski's first order of business will be to appoint a prime minister, who  will then put together Poland's next government. Speculation has centered on  Wladislaw Baka, a Politburo member and party economic specialist. Political  observers say the government is likely to rely more than ever on technocratic  experts, rather than political figures.  </P> <P> Jaruzelski is also expected to resign his post as party leader, thereby  establishing the principle that the head of state and the top post in the  Communist Party should be separated.  </P></p>

			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Nagorno Karabakh conflict worsens FIGHTING in Nagorno Karabakh, the Armenian-populated district in Azerbaijan, intensified yesterday in spite of an agreement by the foreign ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan to recommend a ceasefire to their governments. Mr Ayaz Mutalibov, the Azerbaijani president, called on his countrymen to 'unite in a single fist to defend the freedom and independence of our Azerbaijan'. The international ramifications of the conflict were raised when Turkey, which borders Armenia, expressed concern over the creation of armies by both warring states on the basis of divisions of the former Soviet Army's Caucasian command. Manoeuvres by 7,000 Turkish troops on the border were described by Marshal Yevgenny Shaposhnikov, head of the Commonwealth of Independent States' armed forces, as 'unusual'. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, urged caution from Turkey. Britain called on both Azerbaijan and Armenia to implement the ceasefire agreed by the foreign ministers - and said that 'it is important to have this translated into reality on the ground'. Russian and Armenian politicians have called for a peacekeeping force from the UN or the CIS - but Azerbaijan has so far refused.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vienna, Feb 23 (AFP) -- The International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA] will probably give North Korea a few more  days to issue visas to nuclear inspectors before sending the  dispute to the UN Security Council, diplomatic sources said here  Wednesday [23 February].    The sources were commenting before the IAEA's board of  governors met to discuss the row over North Korea's year-long  refusal to allow IAEA inspectors to check sites suspected of  containing evidence of a nuclear bomb building program.    If there has been no "favourable progress" by early March on  an exact date for inspections to resume, IAEA general director  Hans Blix should convene another meeting of the board of  governors, which would send the issue to the Security Council to  impose international sanctions on Pyongyang, the sources said.    The standoff between Pyongyang and the international  community appeared to be over last week, when North Korea said  it would allow inspections to resume, but there has since been a  delay in issuing visas for the inspectors.    Seeking not to provoke Pyongyang, the sources here Wednesday  avoided using the term "ultimatum." They said the new delay was  because of bilateral U.S.-North Korean talks underway in New  York.    A U.S. official said Tuesday in New York that problems  remained between the two sides, but that the question of issuing  visas to international nuclear inspectors was not a major  problem.    Meanwhile North Korean Embassy counsellor Ho Jin Yun  confirmed here Wednesday that his country was seeking a public  announcement that military maneuvers between the United States  and South Korea were being cancelled as one of its conditions  for issuing the visas.    He said the other conditions were: A simultaneous  announcement in New York of the exact date for inspections, as  well as the date for a third round of formal negotiations  between Washington and Pyongyang, and a date for resuming talks  betweeen the two Koreas.    The official repeated however that a "special inspection" of  two sites at Yongbyon, 95 kilometers (60 miles) north of  Pyongyang, where the IAEA suspects liquid and solid nuclear  waste -- evidence of a military nuclear program -- is stored,  was "out of the question."    Inspections would be limited to seven nuclear sites which  North Kora has declared under an inspection agreement within the  framework of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, he said.</p>

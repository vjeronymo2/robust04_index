(``BSE''), Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CHX''), and Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing this security from listing and registration include the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to the Company, in order to reduce expenses and simplify its stock exchange processes, the Company has decided to withdraw those listings that are costly to maintain and have very low trading volumes. These include the Company's listings on the BSE, CHX, and Phlx.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to the Company, it will continue listing its shares on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc.

			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Conference is a movable feast - In A Nutshell The approach of 1993 and the formal creation of the single European market has prompted the organisers of this year's National Small Firms Policy and Research Conference to hold part of the event in France. The conference, the largest annual get-together of academics specialising in small firms research, will start in Southampton on November 25 and 26 and, after an evening cruise to Cherbourg, continue for its final day in France. Topics which are expected to be included among the papers to be presented are small firms policies in the recession; the preparedness among small firms for the single market; business ethics; and tensions between local and national policy following the creation of Training and Enterprise Councils.

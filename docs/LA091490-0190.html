			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> DANGERFIELD HAS JURY BUG-EYED  </P> <P> Rodney Dangerfield left 'em laughing after three days of testimony in his  lawsuit against Caesars Palace.  </P> <P> The comedian's lawyers surprised a federal judge Thursday by resting their case  after calling only Dangerfield and a hotel employee as witnesses.  </P> <P> Dangerfield contends that he suffered a serious eye injury in a steam bath at  the resort in March, 1988. He completed his combative and contradictory  testimony with a flourish, getting jurors and spectators to laugh as he told a  joke to demonstrate how he uses his eyes in his stage act.  </P> <P> "My dog found out we look alike. So he killed himself," Dangerfield said, his  eyes bulging for effect.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Roger Foley recessed the trial until Monday.  </P> <P> Dangerfield, 68, is suing Caesars for $225,000 in lost wages and $5 million in  punitive damages. Caesars countersued, seeking $100,000 and punitive damages.  </P></p>

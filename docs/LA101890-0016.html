			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOM FOOD;  </P> <P> REMEMBERING THE WOMEN WHO SHAPED OUR TASTES. THE RECIPES ARE THE LEAST OF IT.;  </P> <P> WE REMEMBER MAMA;  </P> <P> WHEN GRANDMA DISCOVERED HOT DOGS, AND OTHER TALES  </P> <P> My grandmother, a brilliant cook, came to live with us from the Philippines  when I was in the third grade. It was a happy event for all concerned, but  especially for my brothers and me, because she had an exuberant disposition,  spoke an unusual brand of English, preferred walking around barefoot and  possessed the nearly supernatural ability to smoke a cigarette with the lighted  end in her mouth. Plus she loved television and cooked with a passion.  </P> <P> For the first year or so of her stay, I became accustomed to the Third World  sights and smells she brought to our kitchen. Heavenly smells that carried me  undulating nose-first to the table like a cartoon character floating on an  irresistible aroma. Or hellish smells that instantly transformed my legs into  buzz saws to carry me fast and away over distant hills in the opposite  direction.  </P> <P> I slowly grew used to setting the chocolate milk carton next to the whole  octopus sitting moodily on a green plate in our icebox, and turning away while  my grandmother shouted her suggestions for contestants on "Let's Make A Deal"  while eating balut, a salted, nearly hatched duck egg that looked like it could  be used in a "special effects" display at a science fiction convention.  </P> <P> Except for these and a few other rather "far-out" dishes (one called "Black  Out" or, alternately, "Midnight Meat," for example) I loved her cooking. I  learned to want her chicken adobo more than I wanted any other meal on this  planet. It's cut-up chicken, boiled in white vinegar and soy sauce with garlic,  peppercorns and onions, and then left to sit in a dented pot at room  temperature for three days. And no, it does not spoil. My grandmother grew up  without the benefit of refrigeration and knowledgeably put food in situations  that would cause psychological convulsions in even the most open-minded of  Americans.  </P> <P> Dinner each night was a joy. Our kitchen was transformed into a cross-cultural  Norman Rockwell painting (if Norman Rockwell could paint a plate of pansit  being served by a 4-foot 8-inch Filipino woman with one eye on the TV and a  cigarette hanging out of her mouth) and remained so until the day my  grandmother entered into what can only be described as her "hot dog period."  </P> <P> For various reasons, money began to get tight. My family had to cut corners  wherever they could. My grandmother's solution to the problem was the hot dog.  </P> <P> She adored the hot dog. She loved the economy of it, its easy shape and its  adaptability. And even after we were over the hump of our financial troubles,  her involvement with it continued. Perhaps it was destiny. The story goes that  "hot dog" was the first thing she learned to say in English after "Hello Joe!"  To my grandmother, the existence of the hot dog was ample proof of a loving  God.  </P> <P> She bought them in bulk and used them to transform previously mouth-watering  examples of Filipino cuisine into, well, something "different." And when she  was feeling especially adventurous, she worked from recipes from my mother's  red-checked Betty Crocker cookbook, replacing actual meat with sliced hot dogs  whenever possible. As in: spaghetti and hot dogs. Hot dog stew. And the  unforgettable hot dog cacciatore.  </P> <P> My grandmother was unfamiliar with and uninterested in the traditional way of  serving the hot dog. To see one in a bun at my house was a rare sight. To see  roundels of them peeking out from a hillock of fried eggs and left-over rice at  breakfast was a vision I looked upon nearly every morning for the duration of  this particularly tragic culinary epoch.  </P> <P> I grew tired of the hot dog.  </P> <P> When I opened the refrigerator and saw the stacked orderly armies of them lying  in wait, I grew melancholy. I soon developed a reputation as "a picky eater."  </P> <P> There were reprieves. On nights when my grandmother had bingo duty, my father  led rescue missions to the Dag's Beefy Boy drive-in, or my mother took the  Harvest Gold electric frying pan out of its original box and made the  unimaginably delicious scalloped potatoes with sliced ham and Campbell's  mushroom soup. But inevitably, the hot dog would return to our table, however  disguised, and we would know it and feel sad.  </P> <P> We lived under this cloud for many moons, and then just as mysteriously as it  descended upon her, my grandmother's hot dog period lifted. Glory to God in the  most high! The days of adobo returned! Plus Grandma, apparently challenged by  Col. Sanders' boasts about his "secret recipe," began experimenting around and  came up with a way to fry chicken that made you do anything to get it. I mean  literally.  </P> <P> Picture this. I'm 34 years old and I am sitting in my grandmother's kitchen. In  honor of my visit she has set in front of me heaping platters of both adobo and  fried chicken, a giant bowl of steaming white rice, a bottle of soy sauce and a  bottle of green chiles, and she has just handed me a cold can of Coke. Now she  is lighting a cigarette and asking me once again to please sing her favorite  song of all time, "It's a Small World After All." How bad do I want that  chicken?  </P> <P> I sing it. I sing it even though it is a song that has given me prolonged  nightmares ever since I first endured the horrors of the ride itself at  Disneyland. I sing it because she is my grandmother, she has requested it, and  I am at her table. But I also sing because I worship and adore her, because she  has made my life incredibly rich, and in light of all I've just told you, the  words suddenly seem overwhelmingly beautiful.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SPAGHETTI AND HOT  </P> <P> DOGS  </P> <P> 1 package cheapest spaghetti  </P> <P> 1 large bottle cheapest catsup  </P> <P> 1 package cheapest hot dogs  </P> <P> Boil spaghetti until it is nearly paste. Drain.  </P> <P> Slice hot dogs into roundlets 1/2-inch thick. Fry for the length of one  commercial. Do not drain.  </P> <P> Combine hot dogs and spaghetti in saucepan and empty contents of catsup bottle  over top. Light a Camel straight and smoke it while stirring mixture over  medium heat.  </P> <P> Serve in vaguely iridescent tan bowls given to you after each fill-up at the  gas station at the corner.  </P> <P>  Adobo's flavor will deepen as the days pass. Stir the mixture twice daily. The  dish is best when served on day three, with white rice and Coke or cheap beer.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CHICKEN ADOBO  </P> <P> 1 whole chicken, cut-up  </P> <P> 3/4 cup white vinegar  </P> <P> 1/4 cup lemon juice  </P> <P> 3/4 cup soy sauce  </P> <P> 1 large white onion, sliced  </P> <P> 5 bay leaves  </P> <P> 2 to 3 tablespoons black peppercorns  </P> <P> 5 to 6 cloves garlic, crushed  </P> <P> Combine chicken, vinegar, lemon juice, soy sauce, onion, bay leaves,  peppercorns and garlic in covered, non-aluminum saucepan. Bring to boil over  medium high heat, stirring gently. Reduce heat and simmer until chicken is  tender, about 50 minutes. Makes 4 servings.  </P> <P> Test Kitchen Note: Saltiness of this dish is cut down when served with rice; if  desired, reduce amount of soy sauce to 1/2 cup. For thicker sauce, remove  chicken after it is tender, then reduce sauce by gently boiling, uncovered,  until desired consistency is reached. Return chicken to sauce just to reheat.  </P> <P> Styling by Minnie Bernardino and Donna Deane  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Transportation Minister Yisra'el Qeysar has  demanded that the prime minister ban the Kakh movement. Qeysar  also demanded new criteria for gun permits to settlers in Judaea  and Samaria. Construction and Housing Minister Binyamin  Ben-Eli'ezer called for the dismantling of the Jewish  settlements situated in the heart of Arab population centers.  Ben-Eli'ezer was interviewed on IDF Radio by Qobi Meydan.    [Begin recording] [Ben-Eli'ezer] In my opinion, we have only  two choices: one choice is to deploy an entire brigade to guard  them and the second alternative is to dismantle these  settlements.    [Meydan] In other words you are talking about dismantling  these settlements for all practical purposes?    [Ben-Eli'ezer] Why for all practical purposes? Today these  settlements are the focal point for tension and potential  pogroms. I say that we have two choices: either guard them day  and night while also watching and controlling their every step  or we dismantle them. There is nothing else to do.    [Meydan] If you had the choice, Mr. Ben-Eli'ezer, of either  bringing in a brigade to watch over ten settlers or to dismantle  the settlement, what would you decide?    [Ben-Eli'ezer] If the decision was up to me I would  dismantle it. I am talking about certain, specific settlements.  One cannot continue dreaming about autonomy and coexistence.  One cannot go along with the process when you see people  forcefully leading toward a violent confrontation. [end  recording]</p>

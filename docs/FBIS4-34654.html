			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Clovis Rossi] </F>   [Excerpt] Brazilian entrepreneurs fear a possible victory  by presidential candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva (PT)  [Workers Party] in the elections. Nevertheless, they do not  intend to divert their investments to foreign countries.    This is the main finding of a survey conducted on 6 June by  Datafolha among 393 businessmen throughout the country. More  than three of four of the businessmen polled (exactly 78  percent) said the country will stand to lose if Lula is  successful at the polls. Yet a still more considerable number  of entrepreneurs (83 percent) asserted that their companies will  continue to invest in Brazil.    Showing consistency with the idea that Lula will be harmful  for Brazil, businessmen even preferred Esperidiao Amin (PPR)  [Progressive Renewal Party] to the PT candidate, even though the  former comes only fifth in the electorate's choice as president.    PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] candidate Fernando  Henrique Cardoso is, as expected, the favorite among  entrepreneurs, obtaining the endorsement of 65 percent of  businessmen. Amin comes in second with 5 percent. Only then  does Lula come into the picture (4 percent) followed by  Brazilian Democratic Movement Party candidate Orestes Quercia (3  percent).

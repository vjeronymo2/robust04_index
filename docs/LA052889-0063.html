			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AND MORE WOES  </P> <P> Regarding the Consumer Report on Amtrak's problems, hundreds of cars are in  storage while Amtrak refuses to use anything but Superliners on the western  transcontinental routes. Besides a shortage of accommodations,  three-days-a-week service on some routes and a complete lack of service on  others, this policy leads to a lack of dining and lounge cars for trains that  split into sections bound for different destinations. Further, the "California  Zephyr" runs right through Colorado's Glenwood Canyon, where the scenery  inspired the invention of the dome car, but the only dome in sight is the model  on the monument that marks the spot.  </P> <P> THOMAS LEE BOLES  </P> <P> Albuquerque  </P></p>

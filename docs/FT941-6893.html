			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Malaysia's fury may scare investors: The UK ban could rebound on Kuala Lumpur Since Friday's official announcement that Malaysia would no longer give contracts to British companies, the Malaysian government and the local media have been emphasising the serious consequences of the move for British business. If the Malaysian government carries through its threat - and there is little at this stage to indicate any softening of Kuala Lumpur's position - many hundreds of millions of pounds' worth of contracts for British companies will be lost. Some companies could be forced to lay off workers in Britain. But Malaysian businessmen privately admit that the move could also have serious consequences for Malaysia. On the broader side of things it could give the impression, already held in some quarters, that Malaysia is a difficult country to do business with. Malaysia, for all its recent economic success, is still dependent on foreign investment, especially in areas of high technology. Last year foreign investments in Malaysia fell by 66 per cent to MDollars 6bn (Pounds 1.5bn). British fund managers have been among the largest foreign investors in Kuala Lumpur's booming stock market, but no one is as yet suggesting a wholesale retreat from investing in what is one of the world's fast growing economies and one of the best performing of the emerging markets. Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, has always put himself forward as an economic pragmatist. 'I'm sometimes nasty to governments, never to businesspeople' he said recently. But last week's action will undoubtedly provoke some cautious thoughts among investors and companies contemplating doing business in the country. Malaysia's leaders have been insisting that the country can do without British companies. In the long term this may well be true. But over the past six years British companies have built up very close relationships with partners in Malaysia and, in many areas, Malaysia has come to rely on British expertise. In the power sector, for example, British companies have been heavily involved in both the supply of equipment and consultancy work for Tenaga Nasional, Malaysia's partially privatised electricity utility. The UK's National Grid company was instrumental in drawing up plans to rectify serious shortcomings in the power supply system following a countrywide blackout in late 1992. It was also reported to be considering taking a 20 per cent stake in a new Malaysian company to install vital transmission lines. All that work will now be undone; future maintenance and supply contracts involving British equipment will be withdrawn. This could cause serious complications in a sector vital to Malaysia's onward economic growth. In the defence sector, Dr Mahathir recently announced that Malaysia was embarking on a comprehensive programme to build up its aerospace industry. The growth of this will come, in the first instance, mainly from 'offset' agreements reached with suppliers to Malaysia's civil and military aviation sectors. Under the 1988 memorandum of understanding between Britain and Malaysia on British defence sales, Malaysia bought 28 British Aerospace Hawk trainers and fighters. The first of those was only recently delivered to Malaysia. Part of the Hawk purchase agreement was a MDollars 400m 'offset' programme involving the transfer of British technology to Malaysia and extensive maintenance and training agreements. Such programmes are central to Malaysia's aerospace industry plans. Malaysia says it will stand by existing contracts, including the Hawk purchase. But given the prevailing atmosphere, further complex defence agreements involving vital maintenace work and training for millions of dollars worth of equipment already purchased might prove difficult to reach. In the present circumstances, virtually anything or anyone British is liable to be treated with some suspicion, if not hostility. Firms like Schroders, the London merchant bankers, which has been advising the Malaysian government on its privatisation programme and other projects, might now find life rather difficult. Malaysian companies involved in trading with Britain might also be a little nervous. Malaysia runs a healthy trade surplus with Britain. No one has as yet suggested retaliatory action by Britain against Malaysia. But if the present argument escalates then Proton, the Malaysian car maker, could suffer. The UK is by far the biggest export market for Proton: it sold just under 15,000 cars in Britain in 1992 and more than 16,000 last year. Britain is also the launching pad for Proton's plans to capture a share of the market elsewhere in Europe. Malaysia, intent on making a political point, seems to be unconcerned about any adverse reaction arising from its move against British business. Mr Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's deputy prime minister, said at the weekend that the move 'does not involve two-way trade, business relationships and investment.' Many British companies would beg to disagree. See Press Review below, and Editorial Comment, Page 17</p>

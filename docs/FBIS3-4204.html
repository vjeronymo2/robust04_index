			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Shanghai, March 28 (XINHUA) -- A new law firm run  by Chinese students returned from overseas, believed to be the  first of its kind in China, has commenced here recently.    The office is to provide legal services for both foreign  business people who have had investment or wish to invest in  China, and Chinese enterprises entering the world market.    It will also introduce Western law firm management  expertise,  said Cai Qing, director of the office, in his office in  Shanghai's five-star Jinjiang Hotel.    Cai obtained a master's degree and then Ph.D in law in the  United States and was qualified as a practising lawyer in  Washington State before returning home, majoring in the laws of  corporation, securities, investment and real estate. Cai's  colleague Tang Yilin is also a registered practising lawyer in  the United States.    The firm has five members who have settled down in the  United  States, and another four coming from the United States and  Canada are expected to join the firm soon.    While mainly employing returned students, the firm is  planning to recruit foreign lawyers, and it will also help send  Chinese lawyers to engage in advanced training overseas.    Local experts believe there will be more such law firms in  China along with the country's ongoing reform of the lawyer  system and the nation's drive to build a socialist market  economy.    China would regulate its lawyer system in line with  international practice, Gan Jihua, vice-chairman of the  Beijing-based All-China Lawyers Association, said.</p>

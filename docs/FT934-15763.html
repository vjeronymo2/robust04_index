			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Markets: Investors eye Somalia and think of Vietnam - Wall Street TRADITIONALLY parochial in their outlook, US investors are learning to pay more attention to what happens outside their borders. This week, for example, the political crisis in Russia grabbed the attention of New York's financial markets. On Tuesday morning, President Yeltsin's apparent triumph over his enemies helped lift the Dow Jones Industrial Average by more than 20 points. Also this week, the markets were keeping a close eye on the deteriorating situation in Somalia where 12 US troops were killed and at least one US aviator captured and paraded in front of the world's press. At first glance, there seemed no direct link between events in Somalia and the New York markets - the US has no pressing economic or strategic interests in the Horn of Africa. Yet, any hint that US forces might become entangled in a protracted, and probably unwinnable, overseas military conflict unnerves Wall Street because of the potentially high financial and political costs. For many Americans, the sights and sounds emanating from Mogadishu revived unhappy memories of Vietnam. Economists worry that the country's confidence, already shaken by a protracted period of economic stagnation and growing social problems, would be further undermined by a messy involvement in another foreign conflict far from home. On a more positive international note, US markets took heart this week from buoyant stock prices in Europe, where hopes for fresh interest rate cuts and a resurgence in local economies boosted demand for equities in Frankfurt, Paris and London. While Wall Street generally regards gains in overseas stocks as positive for domestic markets, there is a danger that the strong performance of foreign equities could lure funds out of US stocks. Recent figures on mutual fund sales have shown that US investors' appetite for funds that invest in foreign markets has been growing steadily this year. Finally, evidence of how international US markets have become was there for everyone to see on Wall Street this week. Well, not actually on Wall Street but on neighbouring Broad Street where a variety of of cars, trucks, helicopters and model aircraft made by Daimler-Benz were on display on Tuesday to celebrate the launch of the German group's shares on the New York Stock Exchange. Daimler became the first German company to obtain a full listing for its stock on a US exchange, and more are expected to follow now that the country's biggest industrial group has bitten the bullet and agreed to calculate its earnings according to US accounting principles. Domestic investors are searching overseas for investment opportunities primarily because the markets at home are looking increasingly overpriced. It is difficult to justify share prices at, or near to, record highs when the economic fundamentals remain so unimpressive. Take yesterday's September employment numbers. Although non-farm payrolls last month rose by a seemingly-solid 156,000, the headline number disguised underlying weakness in the manufacturing sector, where payrolls actually shrank last month. There was also a worrying decline in the number of work-hours. The weakness in manufacturing jobs explained why the stock markets ignored yesterday's rally in bond prices. The 30-year bond shot up by more than a point after the employment report, lowering the yield to 5.917 per cent, but equities fell. Investors are also concerned about corporate earnings. The third-quarter reporting season opens in earnest next week and, over the past few days, several big companies - notably Advanced Micro Devices and Corning - issued warnings that their latest three-monthly results would fall short of market expectations. Although there were other companies, such as Chemical Banking and Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber, predicting strong improvements in profits this week, investors preferred to dwell longer on the negative news. The weakness of market sentiment has prevented prices from gaining much of a lift from the recent rash of mergers and acquisitions. Two more sizeable deals were announced this week. In the banking sector, the regional banks KeyCorp and Society Corp unveiled plans to join forces while, in the healthcare sector, HCA-Hospital Corporation of America agreed to be acquired by Columbia Healthcare. Both transactions were measured in billions of dollars, and are proof of a remarkable recovery in the domestic M&amp;A business. The latest figures show that M&amp;A activity, measured in numbers of transactions, is stronger than it has ever been. Monday     3577.76 - 03.35 Tuesday    3587.26 + 09.50 Wednesday  3598.99 + 11.73 Thursday   3583.63 - 15.36 Friday     3584.74 +  1.11</p>

			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Brussels may set steel production targets in move to rescue industry THE European Commission is considering a new role as EC steel market supervisor, setting guidelines on future production levels. The plan, aimed at tackling Europe's steel industry crisis, is under review in Brussels. But the Commission will stop short of dictating prices and production levels to individual companies, like the 'crisis cartel' set up by Viscount Etienne Davignon, then industry commissioner, during the early 1980s, EC officials stressed yesterday. Under the proposals, Brussels would lay down recommendations on production and delivery levels within the EC for each quarter. EC officials maintained yesterday this would not encourage a cartel. Another measure under review is for the steel industry to pool 'crisis funds' for the restructuring of each individual sector. The Commission is anxious to place the burden of decisions about restructuring on the steelmakers, and avoid being accused of manipulating the market. But Brussels believes it has a vital role to play as broker between steelmakers and governments. EC officials said the Commission would make clear it was willing to support an industry-wide restructuring plan only if Europe's steelmakers produced a 'definite' closure programme by the end of September which could be carried out by end-1994. A rescue plan is also dependent on the support of EC member states which would have to bear a portion of the EC funding of up to Ecu900m (Pounds 730m) to cover redundancy costs. The overall cost of restructuring could be more than Ecu6bn, according to a report by Mr Fernand Braun, the EC's special steel envoy. The Braun report warns that, without a rescue plan involving some early price rises, some of Europe's largest steelmakers will see their cashflow dry up or turn negative by year-end. The report includes a range of potential cuts in capacity suggested by some 70 managing directors of EC steel companies in the past four months. Mr Martin Bangemann, EC industry commissioner, has begun canvassing fellow Commissioners' support and will present formal proposals next Wednesday. The EC will discuss the steel industry crisis at a special meeting on February 25.</p>

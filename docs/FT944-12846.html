			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Heseltine attempts to rescue mail sale Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has launched a last-ditch effort to rescue his proposed sale of a majority of the Royal Mail before a cabinet decision this week on whether to drop the privatisation. With a dozen Tory MPs publicly committed to opposing the sale of 51 per cent of the Royal Mail Mr Heseltine was said to be considering a range of possible compromises to 'buy off' the rebels. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is also determined that the sale should go ahead. The two main cabinet supporters of privatisation will seek to persuade Mr John Major that at least some of the Tory opponents could be persuaded to support a sale if stronger guarantees were given on the future of small post offices. But there were also suggestions among Tory MPs that, as a fall-back position, Mr Heseltine was ready to consider legislating initially for the sale of a minority stake or for a majority sale phased over a number of years. The Treasury, however, remains strongly opposed to the idea that the Post Office be given much greater freedom in the public sector. Mr Clarke has said that such a move would significantly undermine the present rules for public borrowing. Mr Heseltine is claiming the support of a majority of ministers in the cabinet. The principal internal opposition remains that of the government's parliamentary business managers. Mr Major is said to be 'wavering' over the issue but to be less than enthusiastic about a confrontation with his own back benchers. Two of the leading opponents - Mr Nicholas Winterton and Mr Robert Hicks - yesterday repeated their determination to oppose a sale.</p>

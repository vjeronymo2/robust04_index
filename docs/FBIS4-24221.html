			<p>BFN     [Text] The leader of the opposition Zimbabwe Unity  Movement, Mr. Edgar Tekere, has proposed the establishment of an  army to counter possible attacks by the governing ZANU-PF  [Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front] party in the  run-up to the country's general elections.    Mr. Tekere called on all able-bodied Zimbabweans,  irrespective of their political affiliation, to form what he  called an Angels With Swords army to retaliate to any attacks by  President Robert Mugabe's ZANU-PF party. He suggested that  members should be armed with axes, spears, arrows, and firearms,  but not bombs. Mr. Tekere's call came only days after two other  opposition parties had told their supporters to arm themselves  with spears and arrows in case of attacks by ZANU-PF youths.    President Mugabe has already sounded a warning that his  supporters have more and even better weapons that their rivals.</p>

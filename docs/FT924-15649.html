			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / UK's lack of policy comes under attack BUSINESS and financial leaders in the UK warned yesterday that the absence of a coherent economic policy and Britain's potential isolation from Europe could damage the country's prospects for economic growth. As the latest tussle between the German and UK authorities simmered, industrialists and financiers urged the government to rid the country of uncertainty by adopting a clear economic strategy. Some said it would take a new chancellor to implement it. Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank, urged the government to make a clear commitment to the Maastricht agreement. One bank chairman, who refused to be named, said: 'I am extremely concerned at the absence of an economic policy in the UK.' Mr David Lyon, chief executive of Bowater, the packaging and printing group, which has extensive activities in mainland Europe, said it was essential for the government to re-establish order in its management of exchange rate policy. 'We want order and certainty. In the absence of that we have huge movements of cash swinging around the world not driven by trade but by people speculating in money. That volatility is hugely damaging,' he said. Mr Geoffrey Shingles, the UK head of Digital Equipment, the largest US minicomputer manufacturer, said he was angered and frustrated by the government's inability to bring down interest rates to a level which would help industry. Arguing that the German position was correct, he said of the UK government: 'They have got themselves in a ridiculous situation. They had the chance to rebalance the economy and they threw it away'.</p>

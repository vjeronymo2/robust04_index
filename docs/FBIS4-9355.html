			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Vaclav Havel by correspondent Eva </F> Hulkova; place and date not given; from the "Conversations at  Lany" program -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Hulkova] [passage omitted] I would like to  touch on a very painful topic concerning the current very dismal  situation that Czech radio finds itself in. A few days ago, the  Radio and Television Broadcasting Council decided to take the  medium wave frequency away from Czech Radio and allocate it to a  private operator. I would like to know how you feel about this  business.    [Havel] [passage omitted] The result of taking the medium  wave frequency away would be a constraint on the broadcasting  potential of Czech radio. What occurs to me against the  background of some other matters, such as the deputies'  sponsored proposal to privatize Czech Television Second Channel,  is whether this issue is not a rather dangerous or exaggerated  passion for privatization, the consequences of which could turn  not only against the public, but eventually even against the  political power itself. After all, if we have only private  radios broadcasting all the time pop-music and advertisements,  and if we have television broadcasting American horror films and  so on and so forth, one day it could happen that important  political information does not at all reach the public. [passage  omitted]    Naturally, this is linked to the fact that the legislation  covering the non-profit making sphere in our country has not  been completed yet. As you know, I often recollect this topic.  One of the many types of non-profit making organizations are  public institutions. While we have the law on television and  radio, these laws are bit intangible and I am not sure about  their quality. This applies mainly to the decisionmaking  mechanisms operating through the [Radio and Television  Broadcasting] Council. The Council's decision is thus primarily  a reminder of the importance of regulating this sphere, of  thinking out well and without bias what position should be given  to the public institutions and of comprehending that they are  absolutely irreplaceable. I regard the trend leading to  imposing an excessive constraint on their potential for the  benefit of commercial media as very dangerous. It is a trend  which could turn against all of us.    [Hulkova] [passage omitted] Now we know what the president's  view is. This view is unequivocally in line with the view held  by the prime minister, parliament speaker, all the  representatives of all political parties, and by the broad  public. All of them unanimously agree that the Council's  measure is not very good. What occurs to me in this context is  -- where is the law, where is the justice? Pardon me for using  such grand words.    [Havel] It appears that the Council, which as far as I know  cannot be dismissed, has been given disproportionate powers. It  seems to me that the Council set up by the parliament should not  be the last, the highest, and only decisionmaking body.  Undoubtedly, it has a million reasons to justify its decision.  But all the same, it seems to me, that just as everywhere else,  in this case there should also be a chance to appeal and to  evaluate its decision on a higher level. [passage omitted]    [Hulkova] This week was very dismal for the population of  Gorazde. As the world is admitting its powerlessness, I would  like to ask whose turn is it now to solve this?    [Havel] As you well know, for a long time I have been  feeling  the world community's bewilderment and helplessness and I have  found it difficult to come to terms with. I consider the fact  that the world community is pulling itself up only now, when the  things went as far as they did, to be sad, tragic and almost  shameful. The Karadzic army is more or less ridiculing the  whole world, doing whatever it wants.    It is only now that there is any really serious debate about  decisive steps to stop this. My view is that the evil has to be  fought, the sooner the better, if possible at the very  beginning. The stakes in this issue are very high; above all,  those thousands of innocent people who are suffering and are  being murdered, including patients at medical points that are  being attacked and shelled. However, there is much more at  stake here -- this is something explosive, something that might  represent a political threat to the whole of Europe if nothing  is done about it.    I do believe, that at least at this late stage the world  community will after all take a course of action decisive enough  to open the door for really serious talks, not just pseudo-talks  when one side deals with the other with the knowledge that they  are liars and that they will deceive them the next day anyway.  This is just a negotiating game. It is clear that it is always  better to negotiate than to bomb somebody. However,  unfortunately, sometimes there is a situation when there is no  other way to force somebody to engage in serious talks than to  use a tough threat against him.    [Hulkova] Mr. President, do you think that the Americans who  are still traumatized by the Vietnam experience will be prepared  to wage a real war, prepared for sacrifices for this issue, if  necessary?    [Havel] This is America's traditional and big problem, it  has  been America's problem before Vietnam and after Vietnam.  [passage omitted]    Everybody understands that the American public is very  reserved regarding U.S. involvement in the world. However, at  the same time it is clear that this big state has some sort of  an indirect responsibility for the fate of freedom, democracy,  human rights, and basic moral decency of human coexistence on  this globe.

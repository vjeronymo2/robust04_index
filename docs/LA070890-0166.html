			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOOLS OF OUR TRADE-OFF  </P> <P> Loose-leaf notebook with pocket dividers. You'll need a divider for each major  item in your project (tile, cabinets). Use the pockets to collect business  cards, small samples and the inevitable scraps of paper.  </P> <P> Attach estimates, purchase orders and contracts to loose-leaf pages organized  by section. After completion, the notebook is your archive and repository for  warranties.  </P> <P>  -- At-a-glance calendar and pen with eraser. Here's where you'll record and  update your master schedule. A pocket version with attached address book is  handy to take along on treks to showrooms or inspection tours.  </P> <P>  -- A large, sturdy carton for storing "samples." Itsy chips of paint or a few  square inches of paper tell nothing about how a color or pattern will work  wall-size. Be prepared to haul around large hunks of whatever you're matching  up.

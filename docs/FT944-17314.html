			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Making money from options I am considering dipping a toe in the traded options market with a view to increasing the returns from my equity investments. 1. What is the tax position in relation to the selling of 'puts and covered calls'? 2. Is the profit from buying puts and calls classed as capital gains? 3. Can the losses sustained be set against capital gains for tax? We take it you are talking about LIFFE equity options only. (If we are wrong in this assumption, please come back to us with details of the precise traded options in which you are interested, because the tax rules for some traded options are different from those outlined below). The answer to both questions 2 and question 3 is yes. As for question 1: (a) Selling an option which expires unassigned. The net premium received is treated as a capital gain which arose on the day the option was sold. (There is no indexation relief). (b) Selling an option and making a closing purchase. The net profit or loss is treated as a capital gain or an allowable loss which arose on the day on which the option was sold. (There is no indexation relief). (c) Selling a put option which is assigned. The net premium received is treated as reducing the cost of the shares put. (Indexation relief on the eventual sale of the shares put is calculated on this reduced cost; the shares put are treated as having been bought on the day on which you are given notice of assignment). (d) Selling a call option which is assigned. The net premium received is treated as part of the proceeds of sale of the shares called. (Any indexation relief on the cost of the shares called is calculated up to the day on which the notice of assignment is given, and the consequent capital gain is treated as arising on that day. If there is an allowable loss, there is no indexation relief, of course, but transitional relief (up to the Pounds 10,000 limit for 1993-94 and 1994-95 together) would be available for notices of assignment given before April 6 1995). Ask your broker, or LIFFE's publications department, for the free Private Investor's Guide to the Taxation of LIFFE Equity Options. (It was written after publication of the Finance Bill last January, but before the CGT rules were amended at the report stage in April). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

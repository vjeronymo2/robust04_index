			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu Bonilla "delivered </F> yesterday to the editorial offices of LA MANANA"]    [Excerpts] Foreign policy is inextricably intertwined with  social trends and with everything that pertains to the  harmonious functioning of an institutional structure. The  Foreign Ministry is vested with the power of designing and  furthering our country's insertion into the regional or world  scene by applying the strategies it deems most appropriate.    Uruguay has been and is respected for its stance on foreign  policy. It has developed a philosophy that is respectful of  international law, and which endorses nonintervention,  self-determination, and the peaceful settlement of  controversies. This is the reason why Uruguay's stance is taken  into account when important decisions have to be made, not only  concerning specific matters in our region, but also concerning  the entire community of nations.    That which at present best characterizes Uruguayan foreign  policy is the strategy of concentric circles. For Uruguay, its  geopolitical situation in the region takes precedence over  everything else. The Western Hemisphere and Ibero-American  relations come next on its list of priorities, and the rest of  the world comes last. Indeed, our national identity is forged  by the give and take of ideas with our neighboring countries,  and from there we can project our image to the rest of the  world. Uruguay has followed two different approaches in its  foreign policy, stemming precisely from its strategic location:  the meridian policy and the parallel policy. The latter  referred to the unavoidable influence exerted by Argentina and  Brazil on Uruguay's geopolitical situation. The meridian  policy, on the contrary, has to do with the fact that Uruguay is  located in a region where the River Plate Basin is of necessity  a point of reference. Therefore, in light of its geographic  location as the bridge country, the country with extensive  grasslands, it plays a very significant role as an outlet, as a  port for the shipping of products from the River Plate Basin  made up of Paraguay, Bolivia, important regions of Brazil, and  principally the Argentine Mesopotamia [Misiones, Corrientes, and  Entre Rios Provinces]. This meridian policy entails devising a  subregional policy that is mindful of and builds on the  strategies followed by Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina, and Bolivia.  It is within this context that the country's policy on issues  like the waterway, or the channels, is analyzed. It is against  this backdrop that the conditions for being the outlet for the  region's production -- which will enable Uruguay to strengthen  its position at subregional and especially regional levels --  take shape.    The process of consolidating strategies that range from  subregional to hemispheric, from Ibero-American to global, must  be achieved with openness and professionalism. The Uruguayan  outlook has thus gone beyond merely commercial considerations in  deciding to join Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. This  decision was well received by political parties, and was passed  with unanimous approval in the Senate.    Uruguay's path toward integration was to a certain extent  already predetermined. In fact, Uruguay's joining Mercosur was  like a person jumping onto a moving bus. The alternatives  Uruguay had, in CAUCE [Argentine-Uruguayan Agreement on Economic  Cooperation] and PEC [Trade Expansion Protocol], would have been  eliminated when the integration process between Brazil and  Argentina concluded. Uruguay thus had no alternative but to  join Mercosur in order to avoid losing all its alternatives, and  to have a say in the many decisions to be made by this  organization concerning both political and trade matters.    Within the framework of Mercosur, Uruguay's option is to  gamble on the enlarging of the market so that trade between its  members will be increased. The old import substitution model is  no longer prevalent, and the globalization and opening of  regional markets -- which is the outcome of similar domestic  policies -- will benefit from the optimal use of comparative  advantages and economies of scale.    This policy on integration is complemented by the idea of  establishing low tariffs so as not "ghettoize" (confine) our  trade to the region, but rather to use it as a tool to insert  our country into an increasingly competitive world.    Whenever we define our position within GATT, or within the  system of international cooperation, we not only stress the  comparative advantages derived from a country's resources, such  as beef, wool, or weather conditions, but also bear in mind the  values added in manufacturing, specialization of human  resources, the incorporation of technology, etc. This all leads  one to conclude that no matter what their size or population,  countries can be more competitive precisely on the basis of  these variables. This subject of competitive advantages thus  also points to our leanings in foreign policy and our position  in the international community.    It should moreover be pointed out that foreign policy (which  seeks to defend our markets and our positions) is necessarily  linked to education by virtue of its ties with the productive  sector, and also to the necessary political consensus that  prevents policies from being erratically changed every five  years, because of changes brought about as a result of electoral  strategies. [passage omitted]    The current importance of negotiations in the Uruguay Round  of the GATT trade talks can be assessed in terms of the  different issues that are at stake on the negotiating table.    So much so that GATT's trade negotiations have reached a  stalemate. They have bogged down precisely over a multilateral  proposal for the solution to the trade problem put forward by  GATT's director general who, aware of the difficulties and  controversies between developing and industrial countries and  among industrial countries themselves, made a multilateral  proposal that envisaged certain concessions by all GATT member  countries. It included the so-called access to agricultural  markets, which is one of the most sensitive issues for our  economies. This leads us in a way to acknowledge the  instability with which we sometimes have to deal in the realm of  international relations, and realize that trade policies like  those within Mercosur, GATT, etc., occasionally involve economic  and political questions that go beyond the daily political  tug-of-war to which a country may be exposed.    The approach that we follow is then to focus first on the  subregion, then the region, the hemisphere, and insertion into  the world. This approach has new variables entailing new  subjects.    Finally, it is necessary to bear in mind that Uruguayan  foreign policy -- like many aspects of our country's  institutional and social life -- needs to be professional.  [passage omitted]    Each member of the foreign service is an official  representing the leading multinational image of Uruguay, with  branches and officials all over the world, making decisions and  really keeping their fingers on the pulse.    We need to demonstrate institutionality and coherence, so  that Uruguay's foreign policy is not simply a matter of soirees  and red carpet treatments, but rather a policy that entails  knocking at the doors of people who work, produce, export, and  trade. A country of 3 million people that could well pass for a  district of Sao Paulo or Buenos Aires, and not exactly one of  the more wealthy ones, must be capable of taking good advantage  of all these things with a competitive spirit and the desire for  improvement. Within Mercosur, he who follows the wisest  strategy is better structured, and he who develops his human  resources or comparative advantages more appropriately will be  able to double, triple, and even be the leader in the  streamlining and modernization of the country's productive  structure. This is indeed foreign policy, international policy,  and geopolitical and commercial insertion.</p>

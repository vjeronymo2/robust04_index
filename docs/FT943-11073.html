			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Congress ponders change in foreign company tax The US Congress, desperate for funds to cover everything from healthcare reform to lost tariff revenue from trade treaties, is considering big changes in the way foreign corporations are taxed. The Foreign Tax Compliance Act of 1994, introduced on Friday by a group of legislators that included Mr Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader, would drop the current arms-length accounting method when calculating the income of foreign-controlled companies. Under the arms-length principle, embraced in all international tax treaties, only income earned in a particular country or state is taxed by that government. The bill proposes instead the use of an accounting method similar to California's worldwide unitary tax system, which the UK's Barclays Bank and Colgate-Palmolive of the US challenged unsuccessfully in US courts. Under the unitary method a company's tax is calculated by multiplying its worldwide income by a factor based on the proportion of its operations in a particular country or state. Mr Gephardt asserted that almost 75 per cent of foreign-controlled corporations avoided paying any US taxes under the current accounting system. He said it was time they 'pay their fair share'. The bill would also end the tax deferral on profits stemming from the overseas operations of US companies, in an attempt to discourage US corporations from moving manufacturing jobs abroad. The lawmakers introducing the act said the tax changes could raise more than Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.4bn) and would help President Bill Clinton make good on a campaign pledge to remove incentives for US companies to cut domestic jobs. 'Everyone's looking for money,' said Mr Byron Dorgan, a Democratic senator from North Dakota. 'There's a source of money out there that's obvious.' Mr Dorgan added that the act could be tacked on to appropriations bills for healthcare reform or for the implementation of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, increasing the likelihood that the tax legislation might pass. Mr Willard Berry, president of the European-American Chamber of Commerce, said he would lobby hard against the tax act. 'This might be more of a serious effort' than previous attempts to soak multinational corporations, he said.</p>

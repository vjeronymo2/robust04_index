			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter 2806 0202 1627: "At the National Meeting of </F> Directors of Posts and Telecommunications Administration  Bureaus, Zou Jiahua Calls for Seizing the Opportunity To  Accelerate the Development of Communications"]    [Text] Beijing, 17 May (XINHUA) -- A few days ago, at the  closing ceremony of the national meeting of directors of posts  and telecommunications administration bureaus, Zou Jiahua, vice  premier of the State Council, pointed out: Postal and  telecommunications departments should seize the current  opportunity to improve service and accelerate the development of  communications, on the basis of implementing the principles of  making overall planning, combining departments with localities,  letting each level assume responsibility for itself, and joining  efforts to build communications facilities.    Zou Jiahua said: The development of transportation and  communications directly promotes the circulation of commodities  and the development of the socialist market economy of our  country. At present, the international environment is conducive  to China, and China itself also has the conditions to develop  communications. In addition, the society's demands for  communications facilities are becoming greater day by day.  Thus, China's posts and telecommunications are precisely in a  very good period of development. Last year, thanks to the  concerted efforts of staff, workers, and cadres of postal and  telecommunications departments, the completed investment in  fixed assets amounted to 40 billion yuan, the newly added  capacity of telephone exchanges for the use of telephone offices  reached 12.86 million lines, and 8 optical fiber cables were  made available. Such a situation is rare in the world  communications history, and this is a very great achievement.    In the light of the principles of making overall planning,  combining departments with localities, letting each level assume  responsibility for itself, and joining efforts to build  communications facilities, Zou Jiahua explained: By overall  planning, we mean that postal and communications departments  should strengthen the macro-management of the national  communications trades and strive to change from the past method  of laying undue emphasis on the micro-management of postal and  telecommunications departments to laying emphasis on the  macro-management of the communications facilities throughout the  country. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications should  conscientiously formulate the strategic principle for China's  communications development and draw up the long-term plan and  the fiscal-year plan for the national telecommunications  development. In the field of combining departments with  localities, he pointed out: The idea of cooperation and  coordination should be fostered, and the scientific research  forces and production forces of various departments, provinces,  and municipalities should be pooled together to build  communications facilities. On no account should we engage in  overlapping construction. Not only should we successfully build  the public communications network throughout the country but  also should we give full play to the role of special networks.  At the same time, we should give full play to the initiative of  all localities and departments.    He also said: To accelerate the development of posts and  telecommunications, we should depend on scientific and  technological progress. Over the past few years, postal and  telecommunications departments have taken a big step in applying  new technologies. They have applied many communications  technologies that are advanced in the world, such as  program-controlled exchanges, optical fiber cable  communications, satellite communications, and mobile  communications. Postal and telecommunications departments  should cooperate with other pertinent departments to form an  overall advantage of research and development.    He pointed out: In the course of developing posts and  telecommunications, we should all the more attend to service  work. The demands of consumers should become the motivation to  improve our work. Posts and telecommunications should not be  turned to a kind of power. The idea of serving the people and  serving the national economy should be fostered.</p>

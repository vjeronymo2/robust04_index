The Libyan paper AL JAHAF AL AHDAR carried part of his New  Year address elucidating a solution of the nuclear issue on the  Korean peninsula.    The paper noted in the preface that the nuclear issue on the  Korean peninsula is related to the maneuvers of the United  States.    Last year the U.S. and its followers, it said, led the  situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war by  inventing the "suspicion of nuclear development by North Korea"  in an attempt to stifle Korean-style socialism centred on the  masses.    However, the Korean people who have experienced the  superiority of socialism to capitalism through their life rose  as one to defend their choice, gains, national dignity, the  country and its independence and countered the moves of the  enemy by declaring withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty and a semi-war state, the paper pointed out, and added:    Their response was an unexpected, surprising blow to the  provokers.    The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula can cover be  solved  by means of pressure and threat.    The New Year address was also reported by newspapers and  radios of India, Zambia, the Netherlands, Britain, Nepal, China,  Burundi, Guyana, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Yemen.    The Cameroonian paper LE CHEMIN carried the full text of the  address.</p>

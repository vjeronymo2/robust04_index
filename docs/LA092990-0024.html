			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEBATE OVER OWLS AND TIMBER IN NORTHWEST  </P> <P> Your editorial "The Spotted Owl Is No Pussycat" (Sept. 20) was very  appropriate.  </P> <P> Forest management must return to a sustainable yield harvest for the benefit of  all citizens. In the 1970s, the timber industry, successfully backed by Oregon  Sen. Mark Hatfield and other Northwest lawmakers, won legislation allowing the  national forests to violate their longstanding policy of cutting only as much  as they could cut for perpetuity.  </P> <P> The spotted owl, marbled murrelet, martin and myriad other species are merely a  scapegoat for the cover-up of two decades of mismanagement and greed.  </P> <P> VANCE R. EWALD  </P> <P> Grand Terrace  </P></p>

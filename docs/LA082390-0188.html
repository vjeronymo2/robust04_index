			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Marcos Remembered: Imelda Marcos, former first lady of the Philippines, plans  to return to Ferdinand Marcos' grave outside Honolulu to mark his birthday. A  special Mass will be held on Sept. 9, according to her attorney. Mrs. Marcos  recently was acquitted of fraud and racketeering charges.  </P> <P> Marcos died in exile Sept. 28, 1989, in Honolulu.  </P> <P> Gone Flat: A popular Tokyo beer hall modeled after Hitler's 1936 Olympic  Stadium will be given a new facade after critics said its design was in bad  taste. A spokesman for brewing giant Suntory said Wednesday the company was  reacting to a petition signed by 60 people protesting the hall's "fascist  motif." "We had no political intentions. We just built it as a sports theme,"  the spokesman said.  </P> <P> Dictator Digs: An anonymous Frenchman has taken over a luxury palace -- at  $1,800 a day -- in Romania which was used as a hunting lodge by the late  Romanian dictator. Nicolae Ceausescu built the 105-room palace in Covasna in  1985, with its own saunas, gym and private cinema, but he used it only twice  before his overthrow and execution in December.  </P> <P> Help!: Raymond and Michele L'Esperance, parents of the nation's first test-tube  quintuplets and three other children, have gotten financial aid from Michigan  to care for three more relatives. "We are elated," Raymond L'Esperance said  Tuesday in Pontiac after his home had been approved for a foster-care license.  The couple will receive about $1,000 monthly to care for their 6-, 10- and  13-year-old nieces after the girls' parents sought drug and alcohol  rehabilitation. The L'Esperances had quintuplets in 1988.  </P></p>

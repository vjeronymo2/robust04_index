In addition  to a cultural agreement, the ministers also signed a framework  agreement for the "promotion of cooperation in alleviating the  consequences of the Chernobyl nuclear accident."    According to the Foreign Ministry, Kinkel stressed Germany's  interest in stability in Belarus and recommended participation  in NATO's Partnership for Peace, which he called an important  building block for an all-European security architecture. At a  subsequent press conference, Kravchanka was restrained in his  comments and only called the offer "interesting." The cutting  off of gas supplies by Russia is not a political problem, but  only due to bureaucratic "problems of accounting," Kravchanka  said.    In the reduction of conventional armament, Belarus has  become  a collection pond of about 2,000 tanks so far, the scrapping of  which it cannot carry out on its own. It asked France, Great  Britain, and Germany for financial and technological aid.  Belarus' greatest tragedy is, however, still the Ukrainian  Chernobyl disaster of 1986. Almost the entire territory was  contaminated by the radioactive fall-out, which moved northwest.  An increasing number of lethal cases of thyroid cancer in  children has given Belarus a sad front ranking in the  international statistics, Kravchanka stated.</p>

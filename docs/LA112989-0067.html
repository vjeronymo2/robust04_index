			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> DYING MAN'S EYE-BLINK SIGNALS SEND FRIEND TO JAIL FOR GUN PLAY  </P> <P> A man whose fatally wounded friend identified him as the assailant via  eye-blinking signals was sentenced Tuesday to six months in jail.  </P> <P> "God brought him back for a few moments to communicate with detectives,"  Westchester County Court Judge John LaCava said of the deathbed identification  made by Frederick Sannicandro, 38.  </P> <P> Sannicandro died six hours after his friend, Frank Zollbrecht, shot him in the  abdomen as they were working in a Yonkers bakery last year.  </P> <P> As Sannicandro was being wheeled into surgery, detectives and an attending  physician questioned him about the shooting. They asked him to respond by  blinking once for "yes" and twice for "no."  </P> <P> Sannicandro blinked "yes" when asked if it was Zollbrecht who had shot him, and  "no" as to whether the shooting was accidental, according to trial testimony.  He could not speak because he had a breathing tube in his throat, officials  said.  </P> <P> Zollbrecht had a history of heavy drinking, according to testimony. During  drunken horseplay, he got a gun his boss had hidden and shot Sannicandro.  </P> <P> The defense maintained that Sannicandro's deathbed testimony should not have  been admitted as evidence because Sannicandro also was drunk at the time.  </P> <P> Zollbrecht was found guilty of criminally negligent homicide and could have  been sentenced to four years in prison. The judge ordered him to spend five  years on probation after his prison term, to do 1,000 hours of community  service and to get treatment for his psychological problems.  </P></p>

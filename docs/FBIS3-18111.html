In a meeting here with visiting Iranian Deputy Foreign  Minister for Euro-American Affairs, Mahmud Va'ezi, Stercken  noted that the German Government and parties shared the idea  that friendly ties and cooperation with Iran should be continued.    The German official also called on Iran to play a more  active  role in solving Afghan issue and the regional crises and  remarked that Iran had more power and authority to peacefully  settle the crisis.    Va'ezi believed that the U.S. was the main obstacle on the  way of materialization of a collective regional cooperation  system as well as peace and security in the Persian Gulf.    He commented that the United States intended to drive the  regional states closer to itself through sowing discord among  Iran and his neighbors in order to sell them more weapons.    Pointing out that Iran had fully cooperated with the United  Nations on Afghan issue, the Iranian diplomat noted that the  international community, besides its humanitarian aids, should  stop sending arms to the clashing groups in Afghanistan.</p>

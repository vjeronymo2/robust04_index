			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Working Life: Always look on the bright side of life - Training Tired, stressed, feeling negative about your job and only capable of mumbling 'not bad' when asked about your health. What you may need is a dose of Jack Black, one of the UK's leading personal development trainers, whose 'performance' before his audience is like a secular version of Billy Graham and his evangelical Christian crusade. Instead of redemption in the after-life Black, an ebullient Scotsman, offers his clients, including companies such as Glaxo, the pharmaceuticals group, techniques which 'will give individuals the opportunity to get what they want out of this life'. Black, founder of Mindstore, is the British equivalent of Anthony Robbins, the US guru for self - improvement and motivation. Black's message is not new. It is that if somebody wants something badly enough he or she can re-programme the mind to get it. Black argues that it is no wonder most of us feel bad because we spend our time being negative and moaning. He says that if the UK is to compete successfully against the Pacific Rim nations it must develop a more positive culture. If people change their thinking, he believes, they can change reality. Ways at looking on the bright side start fairly simply. Black urges his clients not to say they are 'not too bad' when asked about their health. 'Instead, say you are feeling fantastic,' he urges. This may not be how one is feeling. But say it enough times and the individual's brain ends up believing it. Black's more sophisticated techniques for 're-programming' concentrate on making greater use of the right side of the brain. This is responsible for creative and intuitive thinking. Techniques include relaxation as well as 'visualisation', which means creating images in one's imagination. In this case Black urges his clients to build an imaginary house which would include, for example, a shower room, where daily worries can be imaginarily washed away. Visualisation, he suggests, should be practiced up to three times a day for spells of up to 15 minutes. Black says that often, before a business meeting. he locks himself in the lavatory, or some other quiet place, to focus his energy through visualisation techniques. Sounds crazy? Well, his techniques have attracted a respectable portfolio of clients, willing to pay up to Pounds 350 for a two-day seminar - individuals such as Sir John Harvey Jones and corporate clients like Abbey National, Texaco, Thorn EMI and Rangers football club. Former clients speak with almost religious belief of Mindstore's techniques. Robert Pilkington-Miksa, a partner in J Rothschild Assurance says: 'What you think is what you get. If you think you will fail you will.' Pilkington-Miksa adds that one does not worry about how the techniques work, but they do. 'I was in financial services before my present job and if I called 10 people nine did not want to talk to me. Then it all started to change and the situation was very much reversed.'</p>

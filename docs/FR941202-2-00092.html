Description <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The proposed rule change adds Articles VI, VII, VIII, IX, and X to MBS's rules in order to establish the EPN service. EPN was developed by MBS in response to a Public Securities Association (``PSA'') initiative to automate the pool notification process with the ultimate goal of supplementing and/or replacing the current manually intensive telephone and fax environment. EPN is an electronic, post-trade communication system for mortgage-backed securities. EPN provides an electronic communications network through which EPN users will be able to transmit quickly and efficiently mortgage-backed securities pool allocation information regarding deliveries of securities for settlement. EPN was designed for use by organizations actively engaged in the allocation and notification process associated with mortgage-backed securities and derivative securities. EPN user firms may be acting as principal to the underlying trade activity or as agent on behalf of another EPN user in a fully disclosed capacity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An EPN message will be required to contain (1) the lot-sequence of ``good delivery millions'' (i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the number of million dollar lots delivered in accordance with PSA guidelines), (2) a pool number that references a specific pool of mortgages, (3) the principal amount at date of issue, (4) the coupon rate, and (5) a termination code. In addition, an EPN message may contain, among other things, additional information such as the maturity date, CUSIP number, current outstanding principal amount, an MBS trade number, internal control number, and interest accrued. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MBS decided that a complete stand-alone set of rules for EPN was preferable to trying to integrate the EPN rules into existing MBS rules. As a result, many of the EPN rules mirror the language of existing MBS rules in order to make the provisions of those rules applicable to the EPN service. There has been an attempt to use the same terms and definitions that MBS uses in its current rules wherever possible. The EPN rules do differ, however, from existing MBS rules in several respects. First, the EPN rules describe EPN and define new terms related to EPN such as ``EPN Eligible Security,'' <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  ``EPN User,'' ``EPN User Fund,'' ``Message Detail Report,'' ``Message Purge Report,'' and ``Message Recovery Report.'' These terms reflect applicable names for existing functions and for new services and concepts. For example, because users of the EPN service will not necessarily be full participants of MBS, they are called ``EPN Users.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The number of securities eligible for the EPN service will be greater than those eligible for the comparison and clearing service at MBS. All mortgage-backed securities eligible for comparison and clearing at MBS will be eligible for the EPN service. In addition, securities which are not eligible for comparison and clearing because of their lack of volume or inability to be valued will be eligible for the EPN service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

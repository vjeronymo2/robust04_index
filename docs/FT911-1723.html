			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Early gold price revival 'unlikely' AN early gold price revival is unlikely given current investor disenchantment with the metal, a leading South African mining executive said yesterday. But Mr Nicholas Oppenheimer, chairman of Anglo American Gold Investment (Amgold), an investment company with interests in gold and uranium mines in South Africa, and in gold operations in Australia and the Far East, said in his annual review that gold had not necessarily lost its traditional role as a store of wealth. He said: 'The multitude of factors impinging on the gold price, and its resilience at lower levels during the past few years, suggest that it would be wrong to conclude that bullion has been permanently displaced as a store of value.' The market appeared to be constrained by a ceiling imposed by producers, investors and speculators who sell on any rally as prices head towards Dollars 400 an ounce. A price floor has emerged above Dollars 355 an ounce.</p>

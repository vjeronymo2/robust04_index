			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Fyodorov insists economic reformwill continue Mr Boris Fyodorov, Russia's finance minister, yesterday told the Group of Seven countries which have spearheaded aid to his country that, in spite of the controversial results of the recent election, there would still be a majority in favour of continuing reform. At a meeting in Paris with senior G7 officials, the minister said he was confident that when the final election results were in, there would be 'a parliamentary majority in favour of economic reform', according to a French official. 'The meeting did not take any decisions, and was not supposed to do so,' said the official. Mr Fyodorov and the International Monetary Fund officials were both quoted as expressing satisfaction with their current negotiations on future western aid. Russia has already received half of a Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.9bn) special 'facility for systemic transformation' and is now seeking to persuade the G7 and the IMF that it is sufficiently committed to economic reform to merit the rest, and eventually a regular IMF standby credit. Earlier this week, Mr Al Gore, the US vice president, criticised the IMF and the governments on its board for being insufficiently sensitive to the effect of harsh budget cuts on individual Russians. But, according to the French official, this was not echoed in yesterday's meeting in Paris where the US was represented by Mr Larry Summers, the US Treasury under-secretary. The International Monetary Fund said yesterday it approved about Dollars 103m in credits for Moldova to help the country stabilise and reform its economy, Reuter reports from Washington. Despite declining economic activity and rising inflation, the former Soviet republic made significant progress reforming its economy this year, launching a privatisation programme, introducing a new currency and moving to rein in the government budget deficit, the IMF said.</p>

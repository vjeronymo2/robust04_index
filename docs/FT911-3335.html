			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / UK Company News: Aquascutum chairman retires a year after takeover by Renown MR GERALD Abrahams, chairman of Aquascutum, has retired from the board of the fashion company after 44 years' service. His departure comes almost exactly a year after the acquisition of Aquascutum by Renown, Japan's biggest clothing company. At the time of the takeover, Mr Abrahams said that he looked forward to working with Renown and continuing to run the company from London. But his departure and the appointment as chairman of Mr Paul Bennett, previously head of the company's Far East operations, is perhaps an indication of the greater in-fluence Renown is now intending to exercise over the business. In particular, Renown is planning to speed up the development of the company in North America and the UK. Mr Bennett has also been appointed joint managing director along with Mr James Stokes, the former vice-chairman. Mr Abrahams' wife, Marianne, who was the ladies fashion director, has also retired from the board. They have however, been appointed the company's president and vice-president respectively.</p>

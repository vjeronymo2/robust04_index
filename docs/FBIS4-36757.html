			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 3 Jun (MENA)--The newspaper AL-AKHBAR has  expressed astonishment over Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq  Rabin's abandonment of his previous approval of the issue of  peace in the Middle East, especially with respect to  negotiations with Syria.    In a comment published today, the newspaper noted that Rabin  announced he had never said anything about Israel's readiness to  withdraw from all the territories of the Syrian Golan Heights if  Damascus agrees to reach a comprehensive peace with the Jewish  state. During the negotiation rounds in Washington, Rabin  repeated this promise over and over again.    The newspaper adds that on the Israeli-Palestinian track,  Rabin has also issued threats and warnings, sometimes convincing  and at other times flagrant, even after implementation of the  first stage of the autonomy agreement between the PLO and Israel  started.    The newspaper explained that as regards Lebanon, the  Security  Council issued Resolution 425, which stipulated the need for the  Israeli forces to withdraw from southern Lebanon. In addition,  despite the fact that negotiations between the two sides started  in Washington and officially still exist, Israeli attacks on  Lebanon continue. In fact, they have reached the stage where  Israeli commandos kidnapped a southern Lebanese leader from his  home publicly and with eyewitnesses to testify.    Concluding its comment, AL-AKHBAR stated that the Israeli  practices confirm that all Israel's claims and promises  regarding peace with the Arabs are nothing more than illusions  and whims.</p>

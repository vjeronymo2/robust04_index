			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): All present and correct - The American way of giving While plant and flower sales slumped last year in the US, another section of the gift market is flourishing: sales of customised baskets and hampers filled with collections of assorted goodies have increased by 30 per cent. Personal shoppers spend, typically, between Dollars 30 (Pounds 18.40) and Dollars 50 each on baskets which may be filled with toiletries, children's toys or gourmet foods. At a corporate level, there appear to be few limits on expense or zaniness. Birthdays, promotions, new company members and corporate anniversaries are celebrated far more enthusiastically than they are in, for example, the UK and provide gift basket companies with about half their business. For the last two years, the US magazine Entrepreneur has named the gift basket industry as one of its top 10 business opportunities. With low start-up costs, low risk and low overheads, gift baskets have made an ideal cottage industry. The idea has yet to take off in the UK where large groups such as Body Shop and Fortnum and Mason dominate the basket and hamper scene. Many of the gift basket success stories are the result of women's efforts to find a part-time occupation to supplement income. In many cases working women have relinquished full-time jobs to meet the demands of the booming cottage industry. Many have found it necessary to recruit several employees to handle inventory, computerisation of orders and delivery. Elizabeth Skelton, associate editor of Gift Basket Review, a national bi-monthly magazine, has been monitoring the industry in the US for several years. Her publication has calculated that the average annual income from assembling gift baskets is now more than Dollars 77,000. 'The downturn in the economy has actually helped the gift basket business,' says Skelton. 'The shopper is looking for increased value for money today. Even in a recession people have anniversaries, birthdays and Christmas gifts to buy. Customised baskets solve holiday shopping problems and have immense 'leave behind' value.' Lynn Mallotto of Rancho Mirage, California, began her business by producing a single basket for a friend at a cost of Dollars 17.50, which she sold for Dollars 35. In 1991 Mallotto's company, The Ultimate Basket, grossed sales of Dollars 125,000. 'People don't have time to shop for gifts,' she says. Niche marketing reaps even greater rewards, as Terry August discovered. A home-based operation, founded in 1987, FanciFull of Los Angeles creates extravagant gift items for the rich and famous. Specialities include baskets made for the casts of Ghost, Star Trek V and Twin Peaks. August's favourite creation is a violin case stuffed with mafia theme items, red wine and single-stemmed red roses for the crew of Godfather III. FanciFull grossed sales in excess of Dollars 700,000 last year. 'I started the company as something to do from my house,' says August. But when a mailing she sent to friends and acquaintances turned up an order for 200 baskets from one company alone, August knew she had more than a part-time hobby on her hands. Bobbi Cooper, founder of A Basket Affair, based in Portland Oregon, travels the country giving demonstrations on how to put baskets together. It was this talent that landed her the entire gift-giving account of Nike, also based in Oregon. By researching the company and then presenting carefully targeted products to almost every department individually, Cooper won the Nike corporate account which keeps her busy all year round. At the most extravagant end of the scale, Skelton says she has heard of one company that created the ultimate car enthusiast's basket: 'They filled a car with automobile paraphernalia and tied it up with a bow.' More commonplace are the baskets sold by companies like Snookies Cookies store. Products range from Dollars 30 to Dollars 300 for a more elaborate gift with champagne, gourmet foods and designer confectionery. Says Crispin Gorman, manager of the store in San Francisco, California: 'We use tea caddies, coffee jars, cookies, candies, chocolates, even some personal items provided by the customer which are particularly relevant to the recipient'. The Los Angeles branch of Snookies does extremely well with the Lover's Basket. At Dollars 13.95, the customer gets a pair of plastic handcuffs, a feather, some massage oil, a packet of condoms and a 'lover's manual'. 'It does particularly well at Valentines,' says Gorman.</p>

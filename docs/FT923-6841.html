			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Letter: Adequate money advice service is crucial Sir, I support the views of your Leader (August 19) on money advice. I was chairman of the money advice funding working party set up on the recommendation of Sir Gordon Borrie as director general of the Office of Fair Trading. The working party represented the finance industry and consumer organisations. It unanimously recommended in January 1990 that there was an urgent need to strengthen money advice services and that the contribution from the private sector should be Pounds 9m spread over three years. It also proposed that a money advice trust be set up. You correctly indicate that little has been contributed towards meeting that target, regarded as minimum. I have the impression, from meetings with certain financial institutions, that an important reason for their reluctance to contribute to a central fund is that they consider they already do a great deal to advise customers who may get into debt with them. But I fear that this is missing the point. The majority of those with serious personal debt problems owe money to a number of organisations. These might include not only building societies but also gas and electricity suppliers plus the local authority. In cases of multiple debt it is essential that there be an ind-ependent money advice service. If voluntary arrangements for funding it cannot be made then something akin a mandatory system should be envisaged. So long as a serious private debt problem persists it is a social imperative that there should be an adequate money advice service. I believe the government should immediately take the initiative with the finan-cial institutions and others to work out a plan of action. Derek Ezra, House of Lords, Westminster, SW1</p>

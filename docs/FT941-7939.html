			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Arts: Today's Television Producer David Munro and reporter John Pilger (who made the memorable Cambodia Year Zero) entered East Timor as tourists and shot secretly on camcorders to make tonight's extended Network First documentary (10.40 ITV). Then they had to smuggle the tapes out. More than 200,000 people are said to have died since Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975. Munro and Pilger have investigated a mass killing at a cemetery in 1991 and especially the subsequent events: it seems that survivors were tracked down and killed, even those in hospital. Given the number of impressive actors around, it is not clear why Oliver Reed was chosen as the subject of the spoof obituary slot on Without Walls (9.00 C4). A better idea is the item in which writer Paul Bailey accuses 'celebrity chefs' of promoting 'cuisine elitism' (9.30). With reference to crime in general and the James Bulger murder in particular, 40 Minutes asks 'Why blame the mother?' (9.50 BBC2). Omnibus looks at the work of Damien Hirst (10.25 BBC1).</p>

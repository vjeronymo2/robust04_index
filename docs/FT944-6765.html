			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Equity Markets: Hong Kong - Other Markets The market is set for another week dancing to the US tune, where the overnight sell-offs on Wall Street sent the Hang Seng index plunging last Tuesday and Wednesday and left the market 8.2 per cent down on the week, writes Louise Lucas. US data will be keenly scrutinised by Hong Kong investors for signals on the strength of the US economy, and any leads that this will provide for bond and equity markets. Domestically, there is little expected this week to influence investors and trading is likely to concentrate again on blue chips. The property sector, under pressure since the local interest rate increase the week before last, will continue to be viewed warily.</p>

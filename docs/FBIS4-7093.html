			<p>BFN     [Text] The new Hata administration will take off early next  week. The business sector and major government ministries and  agencies have high hopes in the new prime minister's strong  leadership--since he has rich experience as a cabinet  minister--and expect him to pass the draft 1994 budget as soon  as possible. Deliberations on the budget have been delayed  considerably.    However, during the coalition's recent consultations on the  key policy of tax reform, the allergy of the Social Democratic  Party of Japan [SDPJ] to the consumption tax surfaced once  again, thus revealing the coalition government's weak point.  Furthermore, there are a multitude of other issues which may  shake the very foundation of the government, such as the  amendment of the Food Control Law in line with the  liberalization of the rice market.  <H5>  Tax Reform, Budget </H5>   The Ministry of Finance [MOF] believes that as far as tax  reform is concerned, "while the coalition's policy accord  represents major progress, the SDPJ still holds the key to tax  reform" (according to the Tax Bureau). During the recent  consultations, the SDPJ again showed an allergy to a consumption  tax increase.    The new administration will have to make a final decision on  the extent of the tax hike along with considering the issue of  amending or abolishing the consumption tax. It is said that  even if the tax hike is limited to a small margin or the old tax  rate for foodstuffs is retained for the SDPJ's sake, "a  rekindling of discord in the SDPJ is inevitable; even if a bill  is submitted, the SDPJ might rebel at the last minute"  (according to the Tax Bureau). The new administration will  probably face a major challenge in June.    On the other hand, deliberations on the budget for the new  fiscal year, which has remained untouched for 50 days since its  submission on 4 March, will probably begin after the Golden Week  holidays [29 April-5 May]. The prevailing view is that, "at  worst," enactment of the budget by the new administration will  come "in late July." The passage of the budget is also deemed  hopeless before the provisional budget expires on 20 May. The  MOF intends to start compiling another provisional budget while  taking into consideration the outcome of consultations between  the ruling and opposition parties on the deliberation schedule  for the budget.  <H5>  Deregulation: Concern About Resistance From Bureaucrats and </H5> the Business Sector    With regard to deregulation, a major component of the  Hosokawa administration's economic reform program and also a key  to a breakthrough in Japan-U.S. relations, Hata says "this  should be implemented steadily." He shows enthusiasm to promote  deregulation as one of his major policies.    However, the relaxation of regulations "is a difficult  problem bearing on the issue of employment" (according to a  senior Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI]  official). There are concerns about how far Hata, who is  criticized for "listening too much to the bureaucrats," can put  down the resistance of the bureaucracy and the involved business  sectors.  <H5>  Economic Management: Economic Planning Agency Sees No Need </H5> for Further Pump-Priming    Since the economy is in a very delicate condition, all eyes  are on what economic policies the Hata administration will come  up with. The Economic Planning Agency [EPA] says, "At this  point, we are not in a position to formulate new stimulation  measures, and there is no need for that" (according to Makoto  Kobayashi, director general of the Coordination Bureau). This  is because the impact of the third fiscal 1993 supplementary  budget compiled to implement the 15.25 trillion yen economic  package announced in February will be felt soon. The EPA  stresses that it would be more important to pass the draft 1994  budget--which has been submitted to the Diet, but deliberation  on which has been long delayed--rather than formulate new  economic measures.  <H5>  Agricultural Policy: Concern Already Voiced on Possible </H5> Obstruction by the LDP and SDPJ    Ratification of the Uruguay Round accord will be the focal  issue at the extraordinary Diet session this fall. Amendments  to the Food Control Law and measures to assist domestic farmers  as a result of the partial liberalization of the rice market are  likely to be the major issues. Since there is serious concern  about the effect of rice imports on domestic farmers, senior  Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries officials are  wary that "the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the SDPJ,  which are opposed to ratification, may come up with arbitrary  demands on measures to assist farmers in return for ratifying  the Uruguay Round accord."    There is also growing demand among consumers for a drastic  revamping of agricultural administration. The key issues will  be how to formulate policies on food reserve and rice acreage  reduction to satisfy both producers and consumers, and how to go  about revising the Food Control Law.  <H5>  Japan-U.S. Frictions </H5>   The Foreign Ministry has high hopes on Foreign Minister  Hata's premiership. It says, "The continuity of foreign policy  can be maintained. He will be able to exercise leadership in  mending Japan-U.S. economic relations" (according to a senior  official).    At Hata's meeting with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey  Kantor in Morocco, the United States demanded implementation of  further measures to expand domestic demand, such as continued  income tax reduction, and concessions with regard to objective  criteria as conditions for resuming the economic framework talks.    While the government intends to come up with a second  economic package to expand domestic demand and open the market  in June, the SDPJ has persistently shown an allergy to the issue  of a consumption tax hike, which is expected to be the main  revenue source to finance extended income tax cuts and  additional public investment. Whether Japan is able to come up  with substantial results at the ruling coalition parties'  consultations on tax reform, and thus conclude the economic  framework talks before the Japan-U.S. summit meeting scheduled  for July will be the critical issue in bringing about a  breakthrough in bilateral economic frictions.  <H5>  Vice-Ministerial Level Official May Be Sent to the United </H5> States To Work for Resuming the Framework Talks    A top MITI official disclosed on 22 April that a  vice-miniterial level official may be sent to the United States  as early as immediately after the Golden Week holidays to start  unofficial negotiations to reopen the framework talks.    According to this official, at the Hata-Kantor meeting in  Marrakech, the United States presented three conditions for  resuming the talks. Japan intends to consider its response after  the inauguration of the new administration in the hope of using  this as a step to reopening the talks.</p>

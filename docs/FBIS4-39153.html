			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Speech by Republic of Crimea Deputy Prime Minister Yevgeniy </F> Saburov at SEFRI seminar; place and date not given, rendered by  Galina Kostina: "Crimea's Potential Is Great, But the State of  Its Economy Is Absolutely Dismal..."]    [Excerpts] We have already reported that at a meeting with  the participants of the SEFRI seminar and French Ambassador to  Ukraine Michel Peissic, Yevgeniy Saburov attempted to outline in  condensed form the economic situation in Crimea. We believe that  the deputy prime minister's view of the realities, illusions,  and prospects of the Republic of Crimea's development and his  proposals on reforming the economy are of interest to Crimea  residents and our readers.    Not many people know about the Crimea. I apologize for such  a  statement, but while I was born in the Crimea and am familiar  with it, I never thought that it possessed such immense  potential. Briefly, the southern zone, which occupies a fairly  small territory, is a recreation zone. Next is the zone of  agriculture--elite agriculture, I would say. It is viticulture  and tobacco-growing in the south, fruit and vegetables, and in  northern Crimea--hard varieties of wheat. The industrial zone  also is not common knowledge, in particular, the  military-industrial plants. There are some very modern  high-technology plants, extremely interesting, which produce  competitive products. For instance, there is a plant-- and I was  astonished by this fact--that has orders from West Europe all  the way through the year 2000. It is the Kerch plant Zaliv,  which makes tankers. There is a rather substantial chemical  industry in northern Crimea, some of it unique.    The Crimea has many ports. In Kerch, for instance,  practically every plant has its own port. The Sevastopol ports  are well known, but not all of them--and there are many.  Donuzlav and Feodosiya are very interesting ports. In  Chernomorskoye there is a Gazprom port, since gas is produced  there, in the Tarkhankut area--quite a bit of it; there is also  oil.    I want to mention one more fact, probably amazing to many:  The Crimea has an absolutely fantastic airfield potential--there  are 11 airfields, eight of which can accept "shuttles." They  were used for testing the newest aircraft and aircraft  carrier-launched aircraft.    This is its potential. But the current state of the Crimean  economy is absolutely dismal. Plants are on the verge of  stoppage; even Zaliv, which I mentioned, is in trouble. All the  wine cellars are filled with our famous wines--a complete glut  at a time when the demand for them, particularly in Russia, is  enormous. Practically all industry and agriculture are near  collapse. There is no money, and frequently no notion of how to  utilize all this now. And, what is completely amazing, sometimes  there is no understanding that the issue of production is not  that important--the important part is to sell all the output.  Amazingly, some enterprise directors still cannot grasp this  notion. There is a quiet hatred toward middlemen who themselves  do not produce anything and just want to make a profit at  someone else's expense, but at the same time the directors  themselves cannot sell anything. And if professional traders  come to them, they are treated like gangsters. This is a problem  that is described by a word that is fashionable these  days--mentality.    We need to utilize the Crimea's potential. I believe this is  not all that difficult to do. There is no other such elite  region on the territory of the former USSR. I believe that this  potential can be made to work rather quickly, but naturally  serious reorganization is in order. What stands in the way of  transformation--other than the mentality I mentioned? The  absolutely unbelievable, terrible barriers we have erected  between us. Since the Crimea is not Russia, Russia happily  applies a custom duty on, in particular, Crimean wines, so that  although the production cost is quite low, the price in Russia  becomes very high.    Obstacles pop up in the most unexpected places. For  instance,  there is a Crimea-Caucasus ferry in Kerch Bay; it gets filled up  on the Russian side, where a declaration has to be filled out  for export of fuel and lubricant materials. [passage omitted]    Having come here, we decided to begin by removing the most  glaring barriers to normal economic activities. In our opinion,  it was prohibitive taxation. I was used to the fact that  everybody in Russia complained about high taxes, but when I saw  Ukrainian taxes, I was totally lost and could not figure out how  anyone can work here at all. One of the specialists who came  with me, after a good look at Ukrainian taxation, exclaimed: "My  goodness, this is Abalkin's garrote, the shadow of forgotten  forebears." We prepared, and the president of Crimea issued, an  edict on changes in taxation. We no longer had any tax revenue,  because nobody had any profit anymore. Lightening the tax burden  in principle increased the tax revenue rather quickly. The  second was, naturally, an edict of foreign currency regulations.  It was not profitable to work with foreign currency. Foreign  currency was confiscated at an exchange rate far below the real  one. A free-floating foreign currency exchange rate is, in my  opinion, an elementary requirement. The Ukrainian Government is  killing its own exports and then wonders why it cannot pay for  gas. Then they want to collect even more money to pay for gas,  and then they absolutely cannot pay. I think this is  self-strangulation.    The third edict is the edict on banks and banking  activities.  The most important part is that we want to lower the charter  capital requirement. Ten million ECU is too much; at 1 million  some Russian banks already expressed an interest in working  here, in particular, Tveruniversalbank, Menatep, and Inkombank.  This would resolve many problems of transfers.    It was a pleasant surprise for me to find out that many  Ukrainian ministers support us. Our actions were to the liking  of the main members of the cabinet, except the very top echelon.    Next we intend to seriously get into the process of  privatization. The Ukrainian privatization scheme is quite  dangerous. While the Russian scheme envisages a quick transfer  of capital, and therefore the process of restructuring, in  Ukraine, with its registered vouchers and absence of an  investment fund, it is unclear how the transfer of capital will  take place. Therefore we would like to utilize a somewhat  different scheme. Of course, our dream would be to have the  scheme that is being used by the Germans in the eastern lands.  But this may take decades.    The purpose of privatization is more efficient operation of  these production facilities--not collecting money for the  treasury, as some think. I am fully convinced that it is not  possible--and not necessary--to get any money for the treasury  from privatization. The money some are able to pay for  privatization should be invested in that same production,  because there is not a single production facility right now that  does not need investment. The treasury should count not on these  one-time handouts from heaven--it should count on taxes from  successfully operating enterprises. We need them to work.    This logic dictates the following method: Since we need to  push citizens' money into privatization and investment, the  voucher method is good as bait, to make them feel like a  proprietor. After that, investment funds should get to work.    As early as 1988-89, when we discussed privatization  programs, Western specialists advised us: You need to create  investment funds, which will accumulate capital, since nobody  will be able to invest such money on an individual basis.    As to the labor collective as proprietor, this is possible  at  small enterprises (small store or shop). People know one another  in such places, trust one another, have responsibility toward  one another; they understand that this really is their money,  their income. As to large enterprises, this means stoppage.  Privatization without investment is a myth.    The potential also can be seen from different angles. There  are absolutely amazing illusions in the Crimea. One of them is  that Crimean sanitariums are such a treasure that the whole  world will rush to buy them, elbowing each other out of the way.  What are we talking about when they do not even have normal  plumbing? Generally, regarding recreation, I agree that very  interesting work is underway on the southern shore of the  Crimea, but I personally would not go for existing sanitariums.  Unfinished construction--yes. But even better--new zones that  could be developed into resorts. In particular, I have in mind  Tarkhankut, which could easily become Crimea's second recreation  zone.    I see the following areas as interesting for development and  for applying oneself: banking, processing of agricultural  products, marketing, trading Crimean wines, production and sales  of the best varieties of tobacco--for instance, Dubek, which  should be revived. In industry--air fields, ports, any industry  where resource-saving technologies can be used; in short,  everything I described as Crimea's potential.</p>

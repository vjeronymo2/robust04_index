			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Property: The end of an affair - Pension funds are shunning property UK pension funds have fallen out of love with property over the past 15 years. The weighting of property within the average pension fund investment portfolio has fallen steadily from a peak in the late 1970s. Since occupational pension funds control assets of about Pounds 450bn, this dwindling interest can hardly be good news for commercial property values. By the same token, the market would benefit if pension funds could be tempted back into the fold. The extent of the shift away from property is difficult to judge. In 1979 the largest pension funds - represented by W M Company's top 50 schemes - held 27 per cent of their assets in property. This share had fallen to 7 per cent by the end of 1993. But smaller funds were never as enthusiastic as their bigger peers. The administrative burden of owning property is more difficult for small funds to cope with. Alternatives to direct ownership, such as investing in property unit trusts, have draw-backs, such as lack of liquidity when the market is falling. According to performance measurement company CAPs, the average pension fund now has only 1.6 per cent of its assets in commercial property. The decline in property weightings is partly due to the poor performance of property relative to other financial assets - especially equities - during the 1980s. Even if pension funds did not sell property, the property share tended to shrink as a proportion of total assets. But neither did pension funds purchase additional property to keep their investment mix steady. Fund managers and their actuarial advisers were happy to drift towards equities. The reasons for this change of heart are complex. The indifferent investment returns from property during the 1980s led to some disillusionment. The introduction of index-linked gilts may also have played a part, by offering fund managers a hedge against inflation of the type traditionally provided by property. The gradual ageing of pension schemes is another factor. Funds which cover a high proportion of people approaching retirement are more likely to invest in bonds - which are a better match for their liabilities - than equities or property. Very mature funds also tend to favour liquid investments which can be realised easily if required to meet pensions obligations. The government's white paper on pension reform, published in June, could lead pension fund managers further away from property. By linking pension liabilities to gilts for the purposes of a statutory solvency test, the proposals are likely to swing the investment pendulum in favour of bonds and away from property. The politics of investment management may also have played its part. Fund managers competing for pension fund business are unwilling to risk having their investment performance tarnished by a heavy weighting in favour of property which can not be reduced quickly if the market turns sour. Big pension funds which manage money themselves can afford to take a long term view. It is no coincidence that they are powerful advocates of property. The property profession may also be to blame for not keeping pace with the professional standards set in the equity and bond markets. Fund management, valuation, rent collection and transaction fees tend to discourage fund trustees and eat into investment returns which are already lower than equities. 'The profession has in the past shot itself in the foot,' said Mr Nigel O'Sullivan of consulting actuaries Bacon &amp; Woodrow. 'Although some are now making amends, the question is whether it is too late.' For all but the largest funds, illiquidity and administrative hassle are powerful reasons to steer clear. Securities linked to property values - such as Barclay's Pounds 150m issue of Property Index Certificates launched earlier this year - could, in theory, get round both problems. But there are few potential issuers. Barclay's is unusual in having more property assets than it wants. It was therefore happy to issue a matching liability which reduced its overall exposure. Still, such instruments could allow pension funds to move in and out of property at lower cost. If more issuers can be found there are plenty of fund managers prepared to argue that pension funds should take advantage. They point out that the link between property values and the performance of equity and bonds is low. Investing in property can therefore protect the value of a fund when other markets are falling. 'There is a strong diversification argument in favour of property,' said Mr Roy Peters, head of pension fund investment at British Gas Pension Fund Managers, which manages Pounds 8.4bn assets. 'This year could bring home to many pension funds that property can do well even when other financial assets are suffering.' Just because equities have outperformed property in the past there is no guarantee that they will do so in future. On a long-term view, the performance of equities through the 1980s was exceptional and - in the view of many actuaries - unsustainable. If the gradual shift of pension funds into equities provided fuel for a 10-year bull market, shares could suffer if funds now shift back into bonds as a result of the proposed solvency test. It is equally possible that the underperformance of property during the 1980s was partly caused by lack of support from pension funds. The average yield on investment properties rose steadily from a trough of 4.4 per cent in 1974 to 8 per cent in 1992. It is no coincidence that pension funds were reducing their exposure during this period. Looked at another way, as pension funds have matured and other financial markets developed, fund managers have become less tolerant of illiquid assets such as property. If the illiquidity premium they demand for holding property rather than equities or index-linked bonds has risen, property yields may never fall back to the levels of the 1970s. Unless, that is, the industry can find ways of making the business of investing in property more user-friendly. For fund managers prepared to take a long-term view, property yields in 1992 were nevertheless cheap. There has been a modest increase in property weightings as a result. If the trickle of pension fund money back into property over the past two years is to be more than a temporary move, though, the industry will have to try harder to accommodate these powerful investors.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President Liamine Zeroual to the Transitional </F> National Council in Algiers on 18 May -- recorded]    [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate.    Mr. Head of government; members of the government; Mr.  Chairman of the Maghreban Consultative Council; their  excellencies, members of the Diplomatic Corps; ladies and  gentlemen.    I would like to start by expressing my happiness and  satisfaction at being present here with you at this ceremony in  which we are inaugurating the Transitional National Council.    The setting up of the Transitional National Council is the  realization of one of the main decisions taken at the Conference  of National Concord; the conference that gave the country the  platform for defining the aims of the transitional period.    On this occasion, it is appropriate that I should reiterate  my firm conviction to work for the realization of the aims of  this platform.    I would also not want to miss this opportunity to applaud  you, O members of the Transitional National Council, and applaud  other parties, organizations and institutions that you are  representing, for your sense of responsibility by answering the  call of duty in order to serve the higher interest of the nation.    Furthermore, through this patriotic commitment of yours, you  have responded positively to the call of the nation and  consolidated, thanks to your stance, the legitimate aspirations  of our people that Algeria will surely successfully surmount the  current difficulties.    The Transitional National Council, which forms one of the  necessary foundations to complete this decisive stage  fruitfully, is also considered an important instrument for  carrying out the program to get our country out of the crisis,  and realizing democracy in the framework of respect for the  deep-rooted values of the Algerian people. With the acceptance  by all of us of the leadership of the transitional stage, we  will have responded to the call of the people, and I am  persuaded that, with the help and grace of God, we will be able  to pool efforts to realize all the objectives mentioned in the  national consensus platform agreed a few months ago,  particularly those pertaining to the organizing of free and  democratic elections that give substance to the options of the  nation in all freedom.    The national people's army, which adheres to the  Constitution, will be a guarantor for any political solution in  this framework.    The setting up of the Transitional National Council, which  comes after the installation of the National Economic and Social  Council, confirms the principal feature of the approach we have  chosen to deal with the problems experienced by our country.  This approach consists of political and social consultation,  especially as the current situation makes it necessary for all  the patriots who are concerned for the country's stability to  fully mobilize themselves so as to make the transitional phase  successful and get the country out of its plight.    Your council is a tangible expression of the mobilization of  all those who believe in the potential of the country and are  working to bring national political life back to normal. I am  convinced that you will be working in this direction in total  belief and conviction.    Gentlemen, ladies: The track of democratic edification that  we started is a demand that emanates from the depths of society.  We strive to entrench it, not as a method dictated by  circumstances but because we are convinced that, thanks to  pluralist democracy, it enables us to provide a qualitative  mutation for our country that will permit it to resume its  ambitious project of economic and social development. In this  respect, I should like to make clear that by edifying democracy  we will endeavor to strengthen political society, and at the  same time entrench civil society. Because each of them has its  own particular role and specific function in society -- they  complete each other, and we do not want to see any of them as an  alternative to the other. Here lies the theme of our efforts  aimed at launching a political dialogue in a legal framework and  for a specific objective.    The framework of the dialogue should fall within the context  of respect for the Constitution and the law and the rejection of  violence, which perpetrators and those who have been conniving  with them have been wantonly carrying out against the nation.    The aim of such a dialogue is, however, to unite the efforts  and to bring together the resources of our nation in order to  realize the aims of the transitional period as stipulated by the  platform of the National Concord Conference. This is the  framework and the aim of a dialogue, which should be a  constructive one, open to all those who are prepared to put the  interests and the unity of the Algerian people before any other  consideration.    This dialogue should not be, however, based upon particular  partisan choices, rather it should be focused upon the nation's  great problems, which have been awaiting urgent solutions.    Our call for a dialogue without excluding anyone stemmed  from  our deep conviction that it is the best means that will allow us  to unite all national forces, which have nothing to do with  extremism and other imported ideas, regardless of their origin.  However, I would like to point out here today in front of you  that my endeavor -- which I initiated last March within the  framework of reviving the political dialogue -- was not properly  understood by a number of parties.    Therefore, every one must define his position in all  clarity in accordance with the specified framework and  objective, and away from any of the calculations or maneuvers  that have become known to domestic public opinion. Concerning  the state, I affirm here that it will be bearing without  hesitation, and with all determination, all its commitments to  leading the transitional stage. In this respect, the  restoration of stability in the country and the preservation of  the security of individuals and property are top of the  priorities. Furthermore, the state will continue the  realization of these objectives without a pause until violence  and terrorism are definitively eliminated from our society.    I would also like to greet and praise our national people's  armed forces, security forces, cadres, men of culture, and all  the citizens who are standing courageously in the face of the  enemies of our homeland. We will eliminate violence and  terrorism in our society within the framework of law. This is  our will and determination.    Ladies and gentlemen, the Transitional National Council must  above all be vigilant in respecting the Constitution and the  platform of national consensus. It also constitutes an arena  for consultation and democratic debate on the main issues of the  nation.    There is no doubt that it will be the best place for  reinforcing the exercise of pluralism and democracy demanded by  all. Ladies and gentlemen, the importance of the challenge and  the weight of the responsibility falling upon you to make this  institution successful in carrying out its tasks is self-evident.    There is no doubt that the cross-section of people who make  up your council will, thanks to their attributes and  capabilities, know how to live up to the legitimate aspirations  of our people.    Ladies and gentlemen, we have emphasized time and time again  that we desire to continue the structural reforms of the  national economy and to establish the market economy system.  These reforms are such as to allow our country to exploit its  national resources in a rational manner; it will lead to a  renewed respect for work and effort and will open up the way for  our creative energy.    We are convinced that this endeavor will in fact respond to  the new requirements of the development of our country, and the  changes currently marking the world economy. Likewise, the  market economy we are seeking, and about which many economic and  social partners are asking questions, we want it to be built on  consultation and social justice . Effectively, there will be a  participation of economic entrepreneurs, social partners and  experts in the laying down of the major orientations of the  national economy, and in assessing the work undertaken in the  field. At the same time, the state will ensure that the burdens  caused by economic reforms are equitably borne, and with all  vigilance the state will also ensure that social justice  prevails and national solidarity is promoted.    It is also self-evident that the state will continue to  perform its' role as an active element in national economic  development. Thus, and thus alone we can control the new course  that the national economy has embarked on, to make it produce  the hoped for results and minimize as much as possible the  negative consequences that might appear.    No doubt you are aware that our economy is at a cross-roads.  It is also easy for you to realize the significant role of your  institutions to tackle the new challenges that are awaiting our  country.    The responsibility lies on the shoulders of your council to  be keen on the principles of modernity, progress, social justice  and national solidarity, which will all remain the firm basis of  the eternal November revolution.    Every effort is being deployed to ensure a patriotic  training  based upon new methods aimed at promoting all Algerians and  particularly young people who are the true wealth. More chances  of employment should be given to young people. Thanks to the  continuous effort in the field of training, young people should  regain the position that is theirs on the path of development.    At the same time, the younger generations will play an  increasingly bigger role in the running of the nation's affairs.  This is a new fact that is reflected in reality through the  membership of your council.    As regards our community abroad and as I have previously  stressed, it will receive a special focus in whatever action we  undertake for the benefit of our homeland and people.    The state will ensure the protection of our community  abroad,  it will also make all the necessary arrangements to allow it to  consolidate solidarity among its ranks and to fully take part in  national development, in which it has a role to play.    Ladies and gentlemen: Algeria will work at international  level to consolidate its relations of good-neighborliness with  fraternal countries and to revive the process of the building of  the Arab Maghreb, which it views as a historical and strategic  aim in the region.    It will continue, with the same spirit, its endeavor to  clean  up the political atmosphere in the Arab arena and bring about  solidarity in the African continent.    At the same time we would like to reiterate our  determination  to bolster and consolidate relations of cooperation and  integration with Mediterranean countries.    Algeria will naturally continue to show an interest in the  expansion of its cooperation with the European Union and the  rest of the foreign partners based upon mutual respect and  reciprocity.    Ladies and gentlemen: I have already affirmed my conviction  in a strong and an ambitious Algeria that is able to face up to  the challenges and to mobilize all its resources in a bid to  make a real break with all negative methods and behavior.    However, we would like such a change to be comprehensive,  in which all patriotic political, economic, social, and cultural  forces would take part in a program that would unite all  Algerians and would bring as many benefits as possible to our  citizens from our country's real resources.    I am persuaded that, thanks to the joining of your efforts  with those of the government, this option will gradually turn  into tangible realities, and open the road to the realization of  the objectives we have set for ourselves, i.e. serving the  people and the supreme interests of the homeland alone. We will  thereby be building a solid foundation with the hope and trust  that will be resurrected in our countryside and towns, and  thereby we will be preserving the heritage of the martyrs of the  eternal November revolution.    Finally, I officially announce the installation in its  functions of the National Transitional Council. I wish you  success in your tasks and sincere endeavors to get Algeria out  of its' crisis. Glory and eternal life to our loyal martyrs.  Long live Algeria. May the peace and mercy of God be upon you.</p>

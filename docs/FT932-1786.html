			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / International Company News: Apple faces up to decline in PC profit margins MR Michael Spindler, newly-appointed chief executive of Apple Computer, faces the pressing problems of Apple's decline in personal computer profit margins. This may overshadow ambitious plans mapped out by his predecessor to expand into new business segments. Apple is expected shortly to announce large job cuts following its announcement this month that second-half earnings would fall below year-ago levels. Apple officials declined to comment on reports of layoffs. 'We want to make Apple a larger part of the information industry,' Mr Spindler said. This followed the announcement on Friday that Mr John Sculley, chairman and chief executive, would relinquish the chief executive role to Mr Spindler, formerly president and chief operating officer at Apple. Mr Sculley will remain chairman. Mr Spindler cautioned, however, that Apple could not afford to ignore problems in its core PC business. Macintosh PCs would remain Apple's largest business for some time, he said. Apple's new business thrusts include 'enterprise computing' and a new range of pocket computers. The company is also preparing for the transformation of its core Macintosh PC products to a new technology platform, based upon the Power PC microprocessor jointly developed with IBM. Although Mr Sculley has been the chief strategist behind these plans, it will fall to Mr Spindler to execute them. 'We have turned raw technologies into products, now we must turn products into businesses,' Mr Spindler says. Apple's entry into the 'enterprise computing' field began earlier this year, with the launch of its first 'servers' - high power computers for use in corporate networks. Competing in a broad range of manufacturers, Apple has stressed ease-of-use over performance to define its niche. It is also about to introduce the long-awaited Newton personal digital assistant, pocket-sized computers that help individuals to organise daily activities and send messages. For the past year, Mr Sculley has eagerly promoted the concept of the new product upon which Apple has placed great emphasis for its growth. He has positioned Newton technology as a breakthrough in the convergence of computer and telecommunications technology with publishing and entertainment, forecasting a multi-billion dollar market for such products. Mr Spindler's challenge will be to turn Mr Sculley's visions into business reality. The situation is reminiscent of the circumstances that faced Mr Sculley when he joined Apple 10 years ago. Apple was then gearing up for the launch of Macintosh, a radically new type of PC championed by Mr Steve Jobs, Apple co-founder. In his early days at Apple, Mr Sculley, formerly president of Pepsi-Cola, was seen as the hard-headed businessman who could bring a measure of discipline to Apple. Over recent years, however, Mr Sculley has become known as a technology 'visionary' while Mr Spindler has been given increasing responsibility for the day-to-day running of the company. As chairman of Apple, Mr Sculley plans to continue looking for new business opportunities. The company, for example, is exploring the potential of interactive television. Apple has been seeking out partnerships, but 'those kind of alliances take an awful lot of time and they have to be negotiated at a very high level,' Mr Sculley says. 'It is too much for one person. I'm getting tired of getting up at three or four in the morning and working seven days a week. 'I proposed to the board that we separate the office of chairman from that of chief executive. The CEO should be the individual who runs the whole company,' he said. 'The chairman could be the person who makes the high level contacts and works on these emerging opportunities.'</p>

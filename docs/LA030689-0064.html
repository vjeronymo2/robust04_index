The week was cut short by the defense's problems with scheduling  witnesses.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE DEFENSE  </P> <P> The court's threatening me with contempt is impacting my ability to adequately  represent Mr. Kraft. '-Attorney C. Thomas McDonald after the judge said he was  becoming impatient with delays.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE PROSECUTION  </P> <P> This court hasn't put 10% of the pressure on the defense (to keep witnesses  moving) that it placed on us when we presented our case.

Brown  </P> <P> </P> <P> NUMBER OF WITNESSES  </P> <P> Last Week: 15.  </P> <P> To Date: 229.  </P> <P> </P> <P> ITEMS LOGGED AS POSSIBLE EVIDENCE  </P> <P> Last week: 26.  </P> <P> To Date: 1,146.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THIS WEEK  </P> <P> Kraft's lawyers will continue presenting evidence in the Hall death.

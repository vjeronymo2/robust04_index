			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 12 (YONHAP) -- Yi Ki-taek, chairman of  the main opposition Democratic Party [DP], said Wednesday he is  prepared to visit North Korea and meet with President Kim  Il-song to help break the deadlock in inter-Korean relations.    "In the advent of the new world order, which will be  dominated by new regionalism and economic hegemonism, the only  way for the Korean people to survive is to attain early  unification of their country," Yi told a New Year's press  conference.    Declaring that South-North economic cooperation is the only  way for both Koreas to survive in the world economic war, Yi  urged the Seoul Government to pursue a parallel policy of  resolving the North Korean nuclear issue and inter-Korean  economic cooperation.    He suggested that South and North Korea open special areas  for investment by both sides.    "The Democratic Party placed its overall goal for this year  on preparing national systems for the era of  internationalization," Yi said.    The party will work for political reform for clean  politicking, reorganization of government agencies to cope with  internationalization, reform for economic structural  organization, stability in ordinary citizen's lives and measures  for farmers and fishermen, he said.    It will also try to realize an "era of localization,"  prepare  for unification, and establish educational, cultural and  environmental policies for the 21st century, Yi said.    With regard to the reorganization of government agencies, Yi  said that the country could no longer expect to boost its  competitive strength under current economic policy, which is  only preoccupied with statistics for economic growth.    In order to open the way for revitalizing the economy, the  country has to reorganize and strengthen govenment agencies in  trade, science and technology, education and information fields,  he said.    Yi proposed the formation of an emergency "pan-national"  economic conference to be participated in by the government,  political parties and economic organizations to solidify  national strength.    He placed the party's top priority on stabilizing consumer  prices and recommended a freeze on utility costs and other  public fees, a reduction of value added tax, improvement for  commodity distribution systems and cuts in production costs.    Pledging the opposition party to try its utmost to block the  opening of the rice market to imports, Yi demanded that the  government cancel the uruguay round of trade talks and  renegotiate agreements on agricultural and livestock trade.    The Democratic Party will never ratify the Uruguay Round  agreement at the National Assembly, Yi said.    Commenting on a move to merge opposition parties, Yi said  the  Democratic Party will do its best to gather all opposition  forces.    He also called for an extraordinary session of the National  Assembly to discuss issues the legislature could not handle  during the just-ended regular session. The issues include the  so-called Dec. 12, 1979, coup d'etat-like incident,  irregularities in the Yulgok military buildup program, and  amendment of political laws.</p>

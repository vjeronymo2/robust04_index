Akhanov, V.A. Korniyenko, J.U. Mamutov, </F> Soil Science Institute at the Kazakh Republic's Academy of  Sciences, Almaty; UDC 631.619]    [Abstract] The great length of excess toxic salt removal  from the soil in rice growing areas (requiring four-to-six years  to reach the necessary fertility) and the eventual  resalinization process which requires periodic repeat treatment  prompted the development of new rice growing practices on  high-saline salts. The use of the new method developed at the  Soil Science Institute at the Kazakh Republic's Academy of  Sciences (NTOZ) is based on using the synergy effect of the new  low-volume ameliorating agents which alleviate boric toxicosis  in the soil and plants, eliminate the pathogenic microorganisms,  and normalize the nutrition conditions. The new practices make  it possible to inactivate the harmful impact of elementary  salts, thus leading to higher and biologically more valuable  yields of rice and other rice rotation crops on highly saline  soils and salt marshes without washing them beforehand. They are  also applicable to nonsaline calcareous soils in the arid zone.  The new methods are implemented by traditional agricultural  procedures used in rice growing. In NTOZ, the permissible level  of soil salinity is 15-20 times higher than in conventional rice  growing practices while the rice vegetation period is shortened  by 10-12 days. The NTOZ method does not call for new flow or  spillway systems, special fertilizers, or special tilling  procedures. Tables 2.</p>

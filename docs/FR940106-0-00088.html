			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 9. Definition of ``Facility'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One labor organization commented in support of the definition of ``facility'' set forth in the interim final rule, which requires an employer with multiple sites to file an individual attestation for each site unless the sites are in reasonable geographic proximity, used for the same purpose, and share the same nursing staff and equipment. On the other hand, one employer and an attorney recommended that a multi-site employer should be allowed to file a single attestation so long as the same employer controls each worksite. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DOL carefully considered this multi-site issue during the development of both the NPRM and the interim final rule and determined that any advantages of a ``single attestation'' would be offset by the problems it would cause. Area prevailing wage rates would be different for sites in different geographic areas. Entities would be significantly increasing the vulnerability of their entire system to suspension from the program, should one of their sites incur a violation or should a lay off of nurses occur at only one of their sites. It should be noted, however, that multi-site entities may develop materials that could be used by all of their sites, with perhaps some minor modifications. See 55 FR at 50504. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 10. State Plans <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Three commenters stated that the section dealing with State plans for the recruitment and retention of nurses should be expanded. One labor organization commented that the regulations need to specify that a State may use a State plan to impose obligations on a facility that go beyond those that would be applicable in the absence of a State plan. One Member of Congress commented that the regulations should specify that the list of eight components of a State plan is not an exhaustive list and that States should be encouraged to develop additional components. An employer association commented that the regulations should include the criteria that will be used for determining whether to approve State plans. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To date, the Department has received no State plans. All of the changes suggested by the commenters would make the section dealing with State plans more restrictive. The Department believes that any additional restrictions would further discourage States from developing and implementing State plans. Therefore, no revision has been made to this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 11. Definitions of ``U.S. Nurse'' and ``U.S. Worker'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The definitions of ``United States (U.S.) nurse'' and ``United States (U.S.) worker'' in the interim final rule include U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals, permanent resident aliens, and temporary resident aliens. A Member of Congress commented that refugees and asylees should be included in both of these definitions, since refugees and asylees are lawfully in the U.S., are allowed to work for an indefinite period of time, and there is nothing in the statute that excludes them. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to comments received from the Office of Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices (OSC) of the Department of Justice during the rulemaking process implementing the IMMACT amendments to the permanent labor certification program, the definition of ``U.S. worker'' for the purposes of that program was amended to include within that definition ``protected individuals'' under the INA's unfair immigration-related employment practices provision. 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(3); see 56 FR 54920, 54926 (October 23, 1991); see also 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(5)(A); and 20 CFR part 656. To meet the definition of a ``protected individual'', one must be a U.S. citizen, a U.S. national, or an alien in one of four citizenship status categories: (1) permanent resident; (2) temporary resident (including seasonal and replenishment agricultural workers); (3) refugee; or (4) asylee. To remain a ``protected individual'', these aliens must complete the naturalization process within a specified period of time. Protected individuals can work indefinitely in the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The H&hyph;1A interim final rule's definitions of ``U.S. nurse'' and ``U.S. worker'' included all ``protected individuals'' except refugees and asylees. To have consistent definitions of the term ``U.S. worker'' in the certification and attestation programs administered by DOL, the definitions of ``U.S. nurse'' and ``U.S. worker'' have been clarified and amended in &sect; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .302 to be consistent with the definition of ``U.S. worker'' for the permanent alien labor certification program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 12. Layoff Provision <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> INRA amended the INA to provide that a facility cannot meet the first attestation element, relating to a substantial disruption in the delivery of health care services, if, within the past 12 months it has laid off any registered nurses. In the interim final rule the Department interpreted this statutory provision to cover lay offs of all individuals who are licensed registered nurses, regardless of the positions they held within the health care facility. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

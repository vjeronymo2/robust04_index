			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 9 (AFP)--Chinese paramount leader  Deng Xiaoping -- who turns 90 in August -- is in good shape, his  daughter, Deng Rong, was quoted Thursday as saying. "My father  is not suffering from any illness and is in good shape," she  said Wednesday during a visit to a charity, the Hope Project,  which helps educate children in poor regions.    The report in the YOUTH DAILY added that Deng Rong gave the  charity 15,000 yuan (1,700 dollars) -- the sum she recently won  in a court judgement against a publisher accused of illegally  printing copies of her biography of her father.    Deng Xiaoping has not been seen in public since February,  when television pictures showed him at a Lunar New Year  ceremony. He seemed in physical decline, with dull eyes and a  shuffling gait.</p>

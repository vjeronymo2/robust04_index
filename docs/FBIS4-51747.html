			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 30 (KCNA) -- Camping of school  children for this year began some time ago at the camps in Korea.    Now the campers are consolidating the knowledge they have  acquired at the school they are training their body and mind  through diverse study sessions and discussions, sports and  amusement games, art circle activities, etc.    The state is directing big efforts to education of school  children through extramural activities. New modernly-equipped  centres for extramural education have been built in different  parts of the country to provide better conditions for these  activities of school children. Last year, the international  children's camp was built at the Songdowon seabeach, a scenic  place on the east coast, and 54 school children's houses built  across the country.    The Songdowon international children's camp with a total  floor space of more than 40,000 square metres can accommodate  over 1,200 children at a time. It comprises peculiar-shaped  camping houses, the international friendship children's hall, an  outdoor wading pool, an outdoor funfair and so on. The  international friendship children's hall is equipped with all  facilities of the highest level which can ensure diverse sports  and cultural amusement activities of campers, including a  1,200-seat theatre, an electronic amusement room, a table-tennis  hall, a room for the dissemination of knowledge of  mountaineering and maritime activities.    Newly-built school children's houses also are provided with  sufficient conditions for the education of children including  various kinds of circle rooms, theatres and sports facilities.    At present, there are one hundred and scores of children's  palaces, children's houses and children's union camps in  Pyongyang and local cities and scenic places.    These places of extramural education serve as centres for  fully preparing the school children mentally, morally and  physically. Here they briskly conduct colorful extramural  activities according to their tastes and aptitudes.    After school, children go to circle rooms arranged at the  palaces, houses and schools to acquire general knowledge of  basic sciences and consolidate their knowledge of sports  techniques, music, dance and fine art.</p>

			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> INDEPENDENT GEAR DADDIES AT WHISKY  </P> <P> If the leader of a young Minneapolis-area band was trying to be super-cool in  his group's Los Angeles debut, he might throw in an overlooked Bob Dylan song  or obscure Paul Westerberg tune to document his savvy rock tastes.  </P> <P> Instead, the Gear Daddies' Martin Zellar augmented his own songs Thursday night  at the Whisky with a well-known hit by Neil Diamond, a move that caused about  half the audience to assume initially that it was a joke. No one has called  Diamond hip in a long time and Minneapolis bands are known for sly, irreverent  wit.  </P> <P> But it was soon clear from Zellar's gently affectionate rendition of "Sweet  Caroline" -- one of many wonderfully appealing songs Diamond wrote early in his  career -- that he wasn't trying to be humorous.  </P> <P> Zellar was, however, sending out a signal that the Gear Daddies are an  independent bunch -- prone to take chances. And it wasn't the only sign in the  40-minute set that suggested this is a band with integrity and vision.  </P> <P> There wasn't much flash about the group -- even by often anti-glitter  college/alternative rock standards. They didn't attack the stage with a  feverish intensity or play at break-neck, post-punk speed.  </P> <P> Instead, they performed the songs with a natural, almost back-porch demeanor  that underscored the convincing observations about trying to sort out some of  life's everyday complications.  </P> <P> "Sweet Caroline" -- an endearing celebration of good times after some bad ones  -- isn't the kind of song that Zellar would write.  </P> <P> He tends to write songs that James Dean might have favored if he had ever led a  rock group: lean, melodic, almost understated tales of wondering why you don't  fit in and trying to figure out if you ever will -- tales that often involve  fractured relationships.  </P> <P> "Yeah, I feel sick and I feel used / You ain't the boy I thought I knew," he  sings in one song. He adds in another, "I don't want to wear your crown /  'Cause I'd only let you down." Yet elsewhere, he pleads, "Don't give up on me  yet."  </P> <P> Predictably, a young band with a new, just-released album would make sure it  crammed as many songs as possible from the album into its performance. Tours  are designed to promote the album, right?  </P> <P> But Zellar and the Gear Daddies -- whose soulful, stripped-down approach  combines the softer moments of the Replacements with a bit of the country  coloring of the early BoDeans' albums -- didn't concentrate on songs from the  album.  </P> <P> Opening for the far more energetic and much-admired Soul Asylum (whose latest  A&amp;M album is a hit on the alternative-radio circuit and who'll open for the  Pixies on Dec. 13 at the Universal Amphitheatre), the Gear Daddies came across  almost as a tortoise in a rock world more accustomed to hares.  </P> <P> But there is a growing yearning in the rock community for new voices and  approaches, and this is a potentially great band -- one whose underlying sense  of heart and craft may eventually make it one of the winners of the '90s.  </P></p>

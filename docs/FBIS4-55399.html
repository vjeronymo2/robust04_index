			<p>BFN     [Text] The MSZP [Hungarian Socialist Party] will only  decide after the results of the second round of the elections on  29 May about the candidate for prime minister. Attila Kert  reports on this morning's consultations among the Socialists.    [Kert] The MSZP would like a coalition government even if --  on the basis of the results of the second round -- it gained an  absolute majority in parliament, said Chairman of the Socialists  Gyula Horn, who was today making his first public appearance  since his accident. Horn stated before the MSZP parliamentary  candidates: We do not want to bring into being a one-party  government such as the MDF [Hungarian Democratic Forum]  conducted in the past four years. He stressed once again that  the MSZP does not want any kind of calling to account or taking  to task in connection with the past four years.    In connection with the coalition speculations, Horn stated:  After the elections, the prime minister will be provided by the  party that has gained the most votes.    In connection with this, Executive Deputy Chairman Imre  Szekeres noted: At the coalition discussions the MSZP will wish  to clarify four issues, and these are: the new government's  most important concrete tasks; the shaping of the new  governmental structure and style; the social contract to be  concluded with employers and the employees; and finally, the  shaping of the new relationship with the opposition. All  personnel issues, stressed Szekeres, can only come up in terms  of a reply to this question. If, however, the coalition  discussions turn out to be unsuccessful, stated the MSZP's  executive deputy chairman, the MSZP will even then undertake to  form a government, because otherwise new elections would have to  be called, which society, in his view, would accept only with  great difficulty.    At the press briefing after the debate, Horn said the new  government's most important constitutional tasks were the  clarification of the sphere of competence of the president of  the Republic; the strengthening of the parliamentary control of  government; and the enacting of the media law.    Deputy Chairman Ferenc Baja described, as the most important  characteristic of the new government's structure, the fact that  it will be built not on personal relationships but on a  coalition agreement, and its main task will be the realization  of the four-year government program.</p>

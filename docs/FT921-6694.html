			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Lonrho may seek early end to VAG deal LONRHO, the international trading conglomerate, may negotiate an early end to its Volkswagen/Audi import and distribution operations in the UK which account for more than one-fifth of its worldwide turnover. The news follows a report last month that the German car-maker had planned to take control of the business when the existing contract expires at the end of 1993. But Lonrho, which is understood to be pessimistic about the future of all non-Japanese car sales in the UK, believes it may be in its interest to negotiate an early end to the arrangement. Seven years ago, the pre-tax profit forecasts for 1990 for the business operated by VAG, a Lonrho subsidiary, were around Pounds 60m. However, last year taxable profits fell by 11 per cent to Pounds 20m from Pounds 22.6m a year earlier. The alternative now being considered is to negotiate an early end to the contract this year which could be worth Pounds 160m: assets are valued at Pounds 100m and compensation for an early cessation of the contract could be worth another Pounds 60m. If this happened, Lonrho would be likely to take the extra Pounds 60m above the line, boosting this year's overall pre-tax profits. While the extra UK profits would help mitigate this year's problems over advance corporation tax (ACT), in the long term the loss of the UK business would be likely to add to them. Its 1990 accounts show that there was Pounds 79m of unused ACT because the group does not make sufficient profits to offset fully against ACT. VAG's pre-tax profits accounted for almost 10 per cent of Lonrho's total pre-tax profits of Pounds 207m in the year to September 1990. Mr Charles Pick, conglomerate analyst at Nomura, said: 'The group are indicating that change may not necessarily be a bad thing if it comes, especially if VAG's future profits are impaired by the rising market share of Japanese transplant product in the UK new car market.' VW, the leading European car-maker, is keen to control distribution in all five European large volume markets. In recent years it has added ownership of the Spanish and Italian operations to its control in Germany and France. However, Lonrho remains adamant that it has not been told that Volkswagen wants to take control of the business operated by VAG and it may still renew the contract in 1993.</p>

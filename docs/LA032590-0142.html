			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> 2 IMMIGRANTS FACE TRIAL IN FRIEND'S DEATH  </P> <P> Seeking a better life, three men fled Guatemala and illegally migrated to Simi  Valley, authorities say.  </P> <P> In a house on Sitka Avenue they met a fellow emigre who rented them a place to  sleep in a one-story house with about 17 other Guatemalans.  </P> <P> There she put them to work recycling tires.  </P> <P> And there on July 19, after a night of boozing and brawling, Ventura County  prosecutors say, one of them died at the hands of the other two.  </P> <P> Oscar Garnica-Vargas and Julio Arriaza, both 27, go on trial at 10 a.m. Monday  in Ventura County Superior Court. Each faces a charge of murder in the stabbing  death of Ezequiel Paz Romero, 37, during a fight. Garnica-Vargas is also  charged with possessing a deadly weapon.  </P> <P> Arriaza's attorney said his client had no part in Romero's death. "The D.A.'s  alleging that Arriaza handed the knife to Garnica-Vargas," said defense lawyer  Willard P. Wiksell. "Our version is that Garnica-Vargas saw the knife hidden  and picked it up."  </P> <P> The lower-middle-class neighborhood around the house is quiet, safe and  populated largely by Latino immigrants, Wiksell said.  </P> <P> Arriaza had lived there for about two years, having escaped the squalor of his  home in Guatemala, a home that the lawyer said is an adobe hut with a mud  floor. "If you had a chicken to eat, you wouldn't get another chicken for at  least a couple of weeks," he said.  </P> <P> Romero and Garnica-Vargas moved in later. They and other Guatemalans shared  space that a woman named Octavila Pineda rented to them in the stucco house.  </P> <P> The three rode around Ventura County in a beat-up van, scavenging old tires  from gas stations, dumps and roadsides.  </P> <P> Pineda had bought a machine to cut grooves in bald tires, and she put the men  to work at that job in the garage, said Deputy Public Defender Richard Holly,  who is representing Garnica-Vargas.  </P> <P> "They would scratch a deeper tread" in the discards, he said. "They'd dip it in  a paint type of a substance to make it all shiny and new. And then they'd sell  them for $7.50 apiece. . . . Hopefully, they wouldn't scratch it so deep that  you'd see the wire."  </P> <P> They didn't earn much money at it, and money lay behind Romero's death, said  Deputy Dist. Atty. Donald C. Glynn.  </P> <P> On July 19 at about 11 p.m., Garnica-Vargas and Romero began squabbling about  their earnings, Glynn said.  </P> <P> Wiksell said Romero was a bully who had a reputation for violence and often  bragged about the guns that he owned and the people that he'd killed.  </P> <P> Romero, who stood 5-foot-10 and weighed 200 pounds, began trading blows with  Garnica-Vargas, who at 5-foot-5 weighs 135 pounds, Wiksell said.  </P> <P> The fight wasn't the first they'd had. When it started, Pineda's daughter hid  the steak knives, Wiksell said.  </P> <P> Romero and Garnica-Vargas tumbled outside and were "rolling around in the  street, kicking and punching each other and scratching and biting" in front of  about 15 other people, Wiksell said.  </P> <P> Arriaza pulled the men apart, and Romero walked away to wash his scrapes and  bruises with a garden hose, Glynn said.  </P> <P> Then, Glynn said, Garnica-Vargas stabbed Romero to death.  </P> <P> The defense lawyer said it wasn't a premeditated killing. The prosecutor said  there is evidence that Arriaza handed the knife to Garnica-Vargas and said, "Go  kill him now."  </P> <P> Glynn said, "It's not entirely clear" where the knife came from, but  Garnica-Vargas "delivers one underhand blow to his stomach, and that's it."  </P> <P> Romero bled to death from a lanced abdominal artery. Arriaza and Garnica-Vargas  were arrested later that night. They are being held on $1-million bail each.  </P></p>

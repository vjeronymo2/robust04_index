			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Arts: Today's Television BBC2's contest to find the Young Musician Of The Year used to be a fairly serious affair. Perhaps it still is, but the programmes have deteriorated; so far this year the music has come a poor second behind chat. Interviews with the contestants have been played literally over the top of their performances so that the music can scarcely be heard. Perhaps now that we are into the category finals (piano today) that malarkey will cease and music will come into its own. (7.30). Those panting to hear the party leaders are in luck. World In Action (ITV, 8.00) presents the 'Granada 500', where voters from a marginal constituency question Major, Kinnock and Ashdown. Later, in Panorama on BBC1 at 10.00, David Dimbleby interviews John Major. Horizon (8.10 BBC2) reports on the growing belief among linguists, archaeologists and geneticists that human communication can be traced back to one original language. Cutting Edge (9.00 C4) offers yet another documentary on police work, this time in the London borough of Hackney where four payments have already been made this year in compensation for alleged wrongdoing by the police.</p>

			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / International Company News: National debt market for India The National Stock Exchange of India plans to launch a screen-based secondary debt market from June 30, Reuter reports from Bombay. The NSE said securities totalling Dollars 44.2bn could be traded on the new exchange. The order-driven market will trade in government securities, treasury bills, public-sector company bonds and floating-rate bonds. It will link large Indian cities though a satellite link enabling real time trading. Creation of the debt market is the first step in a government plan to establish a fully-computerised national stock market. At present there are 22 stock exchanges in India. The NSE is expected to begin trading later this year or next year. India's equity markets are capitalised at Dollars 120bn. The government and financial institutions backed the launch of the NSE following the 1992 securities scandal, in which banks and brokers were accused of siphoning money from the inter-bank securities market to invest on the-then booming Bombay Stock Exchange. Brokers see the NSE as part of pressure on the regional stock markets to reform trading activities. Mr R. H. Patil, NSE managing director, said it will completely transform secondary debt trading, bringing full transparency to a market previously dogged by secrecy.</p>

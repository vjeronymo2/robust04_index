			<p>BFN     [Text] Harbin, April 17 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier  Zhu Rongji today ended a six-day tour of north-east China's  Heilongjiang Province, after visits to Daqing, Zhaodong, Harbin  and other cities.    Accompanied by senior provincial officials, the vice-premier  went to local oilfields, factories, grain depots, market places  and state farms to explore people's lives.    He also held talks with local officials and entrepreneurs,  exchanging views on how to develop the local economy.    The vice-premier said Heilongjiang's difficulties in  developing its economy is temporary and can be overcome. "There  are bright prospects for invigorating the local economy," Zhu  said.    He said the province's resource-processing type of economy,  its big heavy industry and large number of state-owned  enterprises should not be a burden to its development. These  could be turned to good advantage.    Zhu Rongji told local officials that the central government  is taking steps to reduce the price gap between farm and  industry products, which will certainly benefit Heilongjiang, a  leading grain-producing province of China.    Zhu reminded the officials that the province's developed  industry could provide a greater technical support in developing  its rural industry, which helps increase farmers' cash incomes.    As it has one of the largest manufacturing industries in  China, Zhu said, the province should take the establishment of a  modern enterprises system as a major solution to the  difficulties facing state-owned enterprises.    In doing so, the vice-premier noted, the most important  point  was to liberate enterprises from interference by governments.    To the province's many defence industry enterprises which  are  having a hard time, the vice-premier also offered a prescription.    It was: to rely more on technical rather than capital input  for better performance; develop more labor-intensive industry to  create more job opportunities for redundant workers; look for a  bigger market share in the service industries.    Referring to debts between enterprises, the vice-premier  warned that this time, the central coffers would not provide  large amounts of money to help clear any debts arising from  poorly-funded capital construction projects.    Not only this, the vice-premier said, the state bank would  stop giving loans to poorly-funded local construction projects,  unless the scale and contents of these projects were properly  readjusted.    While urging the province to step up its effort to attract  more overseas investment, the vice-premier also called for  better administration and higher product quality in border  trade, so that this would develop further and more healthily.    On his visit to Daqing, Zhu Rongji noted that the city's oil  industry should employ more new technology to maintain its oil  output at the present level by the year 2000.    Zhu Rongji was accompanied on his tour by Finance Minister  Liu Zhongli, Railway Minister Han Shubin, Coal Industry Minister  Wang Senhao and other officials from the State Council.</p>

			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Air ticket systems clash AMADEUS, the computer reservation system (CRS) jointly owned by Air France, Lufthansa of Germany and Iberia of Spain, yesterday reacted angrily to a campaign by its US rival CRS system Sabre, owned by American Airlines. The latter is accusing Amadeus of delaying new EC regulations on computer travel reservation systems. The European group claimed American Airlines was 'wilfully misrepresneting the issue' by alleging that European carriers and Amadeus were attempting to prevent European travellers benefiting from lower air fares provided by Sabre. 'American actually tried to prove that Amadeus does not allow a travel agency to search for lower fares in a document directed to the EC,' said Mr Miguel Vermehren, Amadeus director of communications. 'We were able to show not only that Amadeus displayed the same or lower fares than Sabre, but that half of Sabre's fares were out of date.' Amadeus said the issue facing the EC was one of data security and equal chances for CRS distribution. The EC postponed approval of new CRS rules after protests from several European airlines insisting on separation of an airline's own internal computer systems and the CRS marketed to the travel industry.</p>

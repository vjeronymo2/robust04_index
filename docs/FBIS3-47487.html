			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 12 KYODO -- A group of Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) legislators on Wednesday [12 January]  blasted two key forces within the coalition government of Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa for their alleged "fascist nature."    "We must see through and fight the fascist trend that has  been clearly emerging in politics for the past half year since  the inauguration of the Hosokawa cabinet," the group said in a  statement.    All group members are legislators of the powerful House of  Representatives.    The 22-member group of the main opposition asserted that  Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) and Komeito, major components in  the seven-party coalition, want political reform to be achieved  so as to gain absolute power.    A change in the system for House of Representatives  elections, a centerpiece of the government-sponsored reform  package, "is a weapon definitely necessary for a political bloc  forged by Shinseito and Komeito." It described the two parties  as having a "fascist nature" in their lust for power.    "We are saying what nobody else has said, though he or she  has noticed the signs," lower house member Katsuhiko Shirakawa  told a news conference.    Calling Shinseito and Komeito "authoritarian and autocratic"  forces, another lower house member, Minoru Noda, said the two  parties will continue to threaten the nation's parliamentary  democracy.    The coalition and the LDP have been at loggerheads over the  course of political reform aimed at ending rampant corruption in  Japanese public life.    Hosokawa has staked his political fate on enactment of  necessary legislation by the January 29 close of the current  Diet session.    Shirakawa and other LDP lower house legislators told  reporters that they will ask lower house and House of  Councillors legislators of other political parties to join the  parliamentary group, temporarily called "The Association of  Solidarity for Freedom."    Shinseito's co-leader, Ichiro Ozawa, is one of the most  powerful politicians in the coalition and was apparently  instrumental in establishing the coalition government last  August after dislodging the LDP from a 38-year-old grip on power  following the general elections a month earlier.    Ozawa is believed to have still exerted strong influences  behind the scenes and have a strong tie with Komeito Secretary  General Yuichi Ichikawa.    Political analysts said Shinseito and Komeito may unite as  the next stage of rallying political forces comes around.</p>

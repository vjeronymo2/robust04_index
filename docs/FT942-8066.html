			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Thai MP quits over US drug charges An opposition MP of the Chart Thai (Thai nation) party, Mr Thanong Siriprechapong, has resigned from parliament following revelations two weeks ago that he is wanted in the US for his alleged involvement in smuggling 45 tonnes of cannabis over a 10-year period. Mr Banharn Silpa-archa, Chart Thai's ambitious new leader, is trying hard to refurbish the image of a party which is the second biggest in parliament with 77 MPs, but is tainted with a reputation for unscrupulous money-politics. The police further embarrassed the opposition last week by netting a Chart Thai MP in a raid on a gambling den. The move may be part of a campaign by the ruling five-party coalition to regain the parliamentary initiative, which they appeared to lose when a proposal to reform the constitution was recently humiliatingly defeated. Earlier Mr Prasong Soonsiri, the foreign minister, alleged that seven more serving and 10 former MPs are blacklisted by the US for suspected drug trafficking. Only one was named: a Chart Pattana (national progress) MP, Mr Mongkol Chongsuthamanee.</p>

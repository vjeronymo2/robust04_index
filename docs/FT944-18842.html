			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / International Company News: BK Vision upbeat on UBS move BK Vision, the investment company seeking shareholder support to alter the direction of Union Bank of Switzerland, said yesterday it was optimistic that a majority of UBS shareholders would reject the bank's proposal to abolish its registered shares. This class of shares has five times the voting power of the bank's bearer shares. UBS on Thursday said it suspected BK Vision, controlled by Mr Martin Ebner's BZ banking group, was putting together a concert party to seize control of the bank, mainly through purchases of the registered shares. The registered shares, on which voting rights are restricted to Swiss citizens, have been trading at a substantial premium to the bearers in recent months. UBS has called an extraordinary general meeting on November 22 to approve a split of bearer and registered shares into bearers of equal par value. No compensation would be offered to registered shareholders for the loss of preferential voting power or the premium value on their shares. BK Vision, which holds 19 per cent of the registered shares, worth some SFr1.2bn (Dollars 938m), said the UBS move had already damaged the reputation of the Swiss financial market as a place which protected property rights. However, it did not indicate what action it might take. UBS shares were the most actively traded issues in Zurich yesterday, and the trend suggested investors believed BK Vision would succeed in convincing a majority of registered shareholders to vote against the UBS proposals. The bearer shares ended down SFr5 at SFr1,200 after a high of SFr1,246. The registered were down SFr21 to SFr303 after a high of SFr310.</p>

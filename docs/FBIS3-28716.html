The ongoing fighting between the Khmer  Rouge and the government was detrimental to the Cambodian  people, Son Sann, the leader of the small Buddhist Liberal  Democratic Party (BLDP), said in the statement.    "The Cambodian people...strongly aspire towards peace, a  widespread and lasting peace which would allow them benefit from  the proper reconstruction of the country," he added.    The BLDP and Prince Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC [National  United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and  Cooperative Cambodia] party were allied with the radical Khmer  Rouge fighting against the Vietnamese-backed Phnom Penh regime  throughout the 13-year civil war brought to a formal end with  the signing of the 1991 Paris peace accords. The peace accords  paved the way for the UN-supervised elections last May which led  to the formation of the current coalition government consisting  of the Phnom Penh party, the royalists and the BLDP. But the  Khmer Rouge boycotted the polls and continued their guerrilla  struggle against the government.    Son Sann said the victims of the current fighting were first  of all Cambodian soldiers from both sides.    "But it is the people who suffer the most," he said. "The  inhabitants of combat zones are killed and wounded. The  survivors have to flee their destroyed homes and abandon all  their belongings. Many try in vain to seek refuge abroad."    Son Sann called on all belligerent forces to declare a  ceasefire in order "to end or diminish the suffering of the  Cambodian people."    He also called for talks to start as soon as possible to  implement a peace proposal put forward by King Norodom Sihanouk.  The king suggested that "acceptable" members of the Khmer Rouge  be given senior government posts in return for the radical  faction opening up its zones, ceasing all guerrilla activities  and merging its fighters with the government's royal armed  forces.    Khmer Rouge nominal leader Khieu Samphan recently said he  supported the king's proposal but co-premiers Prince Norodom  Ranariddh and Hun Sen accused him of being "insincere" and  demanded that the Khmer Rouge obey a ceasefire first and then  hold the peace talks.    Government forces captured the Khmer Rouge's major  headquarters and logistics base at Anlung Veng, near the Thai  border in Siem Reap province on February 5, government officials  said, adding that one of the main objectives of the attack was  to push the guerrillas towards accepting a ceasefire.    Troops were also moving on Khmer Rouge positions to the east  of Anlung Veng, in remote northern Preah Vihear province,  co-premier Prince Ranariddh said Monday.    Some 2,000 villagers recently fled their homes in the Choam  Khsan district of Preah Vihear to escape heavy guerrilla rocket  and artillery attacks on government positions    Prince Ranariddh and Hun Sen have also threatened to attack  the Khmer Rouge's main headquarters at Pailin in Battambang  province if the guerrillas did not agree to the ceasefire prior  to negotiations.    A western diplomat, however, said the government seemed to  be  losing patience with the guerrillas and to be shifting from a  policy of fighting and talking, to just fighting.</p>

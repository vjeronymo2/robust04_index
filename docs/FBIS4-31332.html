			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 2/6/1994 -- Appreciative  statements about Romania's position to the crisis in the  Yugoslav space made by several high-ranking officials of the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia have been clustered by the daily  newspaper DIMINEATA in its today's issue.    Radoje Kontic, prime minister of the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia, said that Romania's position relative to the complex  situation in the area of former Yugoslavia, including its stance  in the question of the economic sanctions instated against  Serbia and Montenegro are remarkable by their being "poised,  objective, and principled." Romania, he said, "has and is  playing a realistic and constructive role in the crisis  affecting former Yugoslavia," by making itself available any  time to be one of the initiators of negotiated settlements  pursuing the suspension of the economic sanctions and as a  country which, after Yugoslavia, has been most affected by these.    Momir Bulatovic, president of the Republic of Montenegro,  showed that between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, of which  Montenegro is a constituent part, and Romania the relations have  always been friendly and cooperative in various fields. "We are  happy that now, in the difficult situation we are confronted  with, we have found in Romania and its people feelings of true  friendship and full understanding. We hope for an as fast as  possible settlement of the crisis in our zone, so that we can  resume these relations," Bulatovic said.    The prime minister of Montenegro, Milo Djukanovic, assessed  that once the sanctions suspended, the conditions would be put  in place for a direct Romanian-Montenegro cooperation, for the  mutual benefit of the sides, in sectors like tourism,  machine-building, ecology, and agriculture.    Under the current circumstances, as Milan Grubic, director  of  the press department of the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry remarked,  in its relationships with all states, Romania included,  Yugoslavia makes efforts to reach a balance between each  country's role and interest in the zone of former Yugoslavia.  The best experience gained to this effect was in relationship  with Romania, Grubic said, the ties with this country being "an  example of communication between two good neighbors. We have  never been in conflict, we have been bonded by true friendship.  In our relations with Romania, we started from the principle  that `ideologies are transient, peoples permanent.'"</p>

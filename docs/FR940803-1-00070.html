			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The health of these seven mussel species is directly tied to benthic habitat quality. The effects of siltation on freshwater mussels is more devastating than on fishes due to the sedentary nature of mussels. Ellis (1936) conducted experiments on the effects of silt on mussels and determined that most mussels tested died from silt deposits of one quarter to one inch. Silt also transfers organic substances into streams, adversely affecting stream habitat and water quality by producing increased and localized enrichment impacts (Ellis 1936).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Artifact and fossil collectors regularly work streams in various portions of the Apalachicolan Region and have been known to use suction dredges to scour benthic habitats, thus increasing siltation downstream. A study on the effects of suction gold dredging on stream invertebrates (Harvey 1986) concluded that impacts from these activities are more severe in streams with soft substrates, which are typical for most Apalachicolan Region streams where these mussels occur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Much non-agricultural and non-silvicultural habitat degradation in the upper Apalachicola River system watershed is attributed to increased urbanization, particularly in the metropolitan areas of Atlanta, Columbus, and Albany. This current high rate of development is resulting in the conversion of farmland in areas relatively remote from these cities. Associated with increased development and land clearing is increased siltation from erosion, accelerated runoff and transport of pollutants in stormwater, and increased discharge of effluents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The tributaries harboring populations of these seven mussel species are criss-crossed by numerous road and railroad bridges. These crossings are potential sites for accidental spills of toxic materials into streams. The large number of bridge crossings in the Apalachicolan Region makes it probable that such a spill might occur in the future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or Educational Purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The fat three-ridge is a potential target species for the cultured pearl industry. Currently a congener (the three-ridge,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Amblema plicata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) is heavily utilized as a source of shell for pearl nuclei in more northern rivers. Due to a tremendous increase in the price of shell, the harvesting of shell beds has resulted in the scouting of larger drainages in the Apalachicolan Region for potential sources of shell. Although prices have decreased since 1992, future increases in shell price and competition for harvestable populations can not be ruled out. Biological supply companies have utilized the Flint and Ochlockonee rivers as sources for larger mussel specimens, including the purple bankclimber and possibly the fat three-ridge, to sell to academic institutions for use in laboratory studies. Supply company representatives have contacted Service biologists in hopes of obtaining information on new, unexploited mussel populations in the Apalachicolan Region. On one recent occasion, approximately 10,000 large mussel specimens, presumably including the purple bankclimber and possibly the fat three-ridge, were harvested from the Flint River near Bainbridge for this purpose (J. Brim-Box, pers. comm.). Some of these species are a potential source of raw material for the polished chip industry. Costume jewelry crafted from purple bankclimber shells has been observed in arts and crafts fairs in the Southeast. Unregulated harvest of the fat three-ridge and purple bankclimber for these purposes, if unchecked, could decimate their remaining populations. Small and/or thin-shelled mussel species, such as the other five mussels considered here, are not known to be utilized commercially.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are a large number of shell clubs in Florida and surrounding States. Both national and international meetings for amateur and professional malacologists are held in this area, and generally include organized field collecting trips to a variety of habitats. The attraction of large numbers of people interested in the study and collection of mollusks increases the potential for overcollection of these mussels. These species, particularly the larger ones, are potential bait species, and are susceptible to harvesting especially during low-flow periods. Publication of this rule will inform the general public as to the presence of these seven mussels in Apalachicolan Region streams. The rarity of these mussels potentially makes them more appealing to shell collectors. Thus, revealing specific stream reaches harboring these species could pose a threat from such collectors. Federal protection would serve to minimize adverse population impacts from illegal take.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Disease or Predation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although diseases of freshwater mussels are virtually unknown, the periodic dieoff of mussel populations in several primarily midwestern rivers in recent years may be due to unidentified diseases. Juvenile and adult mussels serve as prey for various animals, and the muskrat has been implicated in jeopardizing recovery of listed mussels (Neves and Odum 1989). Muskrats do not occur with regularity on Coastal Plain streams, where most of these mussels exist. However, Piedmont populations of the shiny-rayed pocketbook and oval pigtoe in the upper Flint River system may be subjected to some degree of muskrat predation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Veronika Romanenkova] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 20 TASS -- "The now existing inter-  governmental agreements on the processing of radioactive wastes  on Russian territory may be revised. In any case, the  Inter-departmental Commission for Ecological Safety of the  Russian Security Council has moved to include without fail an  article in those documents, laying down that the processed  wastes should be returned to the countries from where they had  arrived," Chairman of the Commission Aleksey Yablokov stated  here today.    There are several legislative acts in Russia today,  regulating the processing of foreign radioactive wastes on its  territory. For instance, the law on the protection of the  environment prohibits the import and storage of such wastes on  Russian territory. However, Russia's inter-governmental  agreements with Finland, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and the  former German Democratic Republic stipulate that wastes from  nuclear power plants, built in those countries with the  participation of the USSR, should be processed in Russia. No  such document was signed with Hungary. Yablokov said that  Russia could, in principle, continue the job of processing  radioactive wastes, but only at the request of foreign states,  on a commercial basis, and with their obligatory "repatriation".    There is a special plant at Chelyabinsk-45, but it is able  to  process wastes only from nuclear-propelled submarines and  VVER-type reactors. The construction of the Krasnoyarsk-26  plant, designed to process wastes from RBMK (Chernobyl-type)  reactors, has still not been completed. More than two trillion  roubles are needed to finish the project. Yablokov said that  the Russian Ministry for Atomic Energy was planning to meet a  part of this sum by concluding an agreement with Hungary.  However, the money that it will get from this is obviously not  enough, the specialist said.    Yablokov also believes that "it is high time to revise the  closed nuclear cycle concept", used until now. According to  this system, enriched uranium and plutonium from nuclear power  plants were used to make nuclear warheads. But since they are  no longer needed, radioactive materials could "simply be kept  for several tens of years" in special storages. They would lose  much of their radioactivity by the end of that period and could  be safely buried.</p>

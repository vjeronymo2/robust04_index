			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIDTERM CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS  </P> <P> Let's try to sort this out. There was (ultra) column-left pundit Alexander  Cockburn (Commentary, Nov. 12) discussing the silver lining aspects of a  Republican real estate developer beating the moderate Democratic incumbent in  California's congressional District 1.  </P> <P> Cockburn states that this was because a third candidate, a Peace and Freedom  type, siphoned off votes from the moderate Democrat.  </P> <P> Cockburn then proceeds to lay the victory and foundation for a new political  movement on the doorstep of an anarchistic weekly newspaper in Mendocino County  that has, at the most, a few thousand subscribers (many out of the region) and  a publisher whose recent acts of journalism include punching out a school  superintendent because he dared to disagree with publisher's views. (Cockburn  fails to reveal that his column has run in the Mendocino weekly for years and  that he is good friends with the publisher.)  </P> <P> Mendocino County has always been known for its fringe political movements,  whether animal rights issues, get-out-the-vote for Jesse Jackson or feeble  attempts to organize a Green Party.  </P> <P> What Cockburn fails to admit is that the radicals of whom he is so proud played  right into the hands of the conservatives, and now a real estate developer will  hold the seat held by a Democrat whose only crime was that he waffled  occasionally.  </P> <P> Silver lining? Hardly.  </P> <P> GEORGE ROSE  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

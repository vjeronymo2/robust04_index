			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev [no date as received] -- Ukraine's Acting Prime  Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy said in a report to the Supreme  Council session today that the government has managed for the  first time to control the situation without emergency powers or  emergency measures and to stop the decline in the public's net  money income and the gross national product, as well as the  growth of the budget deficit.    "The government has been in office since September last year  when the ongoing executive power crisis was worsened by the  energy and payment crises which resulted from the ill-considered  price and credit policy of the previous government," he said.  "At that time forecasts were heard both inside the government  and in the media that Ukraine would not survive the crisis and  would lose its sovereignty. Therefore, the new government's  urgent steps included, first of all, prevention of the payment  crisis. The government allocated 2,300 billion karbovantsi in  credits and 6,300 billion karbovantsi in budget grants for the  harvest and spring sowing. Already 1.3 million of the envisaged  2 million [metric] tonnes of oil products have been supplied to  the countryside. The presidential decree `On provision of  finance and credits toward food procurement' was aimed at  creating more favorable conditions in agriculture."    One of the government's achievements, according to  Zvyahilskyy, was the overcoming of the energy crisis. The  energy complex was on the brink of collapse, therefore, the  government used hard currency to improve the situation and  deliver fuel supplies on more favorable terms than last year.  Over five million tonnes of coal was supplied to electric power  stations. Restrictions were imposed on the consumption of all  types of energy in the industry and at home, "which did not make  the government any more popular." However, a number of  legislative acts were not passed, including a law on energy  saving. The government coordinated the price, budget, and  credit policies. "Price control by economic means must become  part and parcel of our economic policy," Zvyahilskyy said. "We  were warned that all government actions aimed at controlling the  prices would lead to accumulation of inflation potential,  therefore we had to keep looking for ways of curbing it  irrespective of the economic situation. I believe that  inflation would make progress if the present government's policy  were suddenly changed.    "During our discussions with the National Bank we concluded  that it was not necessary to subordinate the National Bank of  Ukraine to the Cabinet of Ministers. The government was forced  to propose a deficit-free budget to the Supreme Council."    As regards currency regulation, Zvyahilskyy believes, the  government proceeds from the position that prices for  energy-carriers, which condition prices for all other goods,  including food, fuel and lubricants, and medicines depend on the  level of the karbovanets exchange rate. The regulated exchange  rate of the karbovanets, together with the government's other  antiinflationary measures, facilitated the stabilization of  prices on the domestic market. If the real exchange rate of the  karbovanets in relation to the dollar fell by 43 times in  commercial banks in the whole of 1993, and by 13 times in  relation to the Russian ruble, then in five months of this year  it fell by 45 percent in relation to the dollar, which  corresponds to the volume of the National Bank's credit  emission, and the exchange rate of the karbovanets in relation  to the Russian ruble remains stable. Yukhym Zvyahilskyy  expressed the conviction that the regulated exchange rate of the  karbovanets should remain and that trading at the exchange  should not be resumed until the karbovanets strengthens.  Otherwise, on the first day [of trading] the measures to  restrain inflation would have been exhausted.    The level of the average wage is periodically reviewed in  order to ensure the social protection of the population. Thus,  if the average wage was 81,000 karbovantsi in August last year,  then it was 880,000 karbovantsi in April of this year. The  poverty level is determined and payments in connection with the  price rises have been established with the aim of increasing the  targeting of payments. The regulation of consumption funds has  been reviewed.    Foreign economic activity is an important factor in the  development of the Ukrainian economy. This year, Ukraine's  exports were $2.9 million, and imports were $2.9 million. The  negative balance of foreign payments has been reduced by several  times.    Among the main problems needing urgent resolution, Yukhym  Zvyahilskyy singled out the summer harvesting, timely  preparations for the winter, and, the most important thing,  overcoming the decline in production.</p>

			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Work categories 'misleading' Government statisticians are creating a distorted view of the labour market by categorising all those who are not full-time permanent employees as belonging to the 'flexible workforce', says the independent employment analysts Incomes Data Services. The latest IDS report challenges the recent Department of Employment claim that 38.2 per cent of all those in employment belong to the flexible workforce. The report argues that it is wrong to regard self-employed professionals such as doctors, dentists, barristers, solicitors and accountants as part of the flexible workforce rather than as equivalent to permanent full-time employees. It also says that large numbers of part-timers remain with the same employer for many years. A separate IDS analysis shows that, in autumn of last year, more than 40 per cent of women part-timers had been with their employers for more than five years.</p>

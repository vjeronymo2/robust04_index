			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Appeal plea over Guinness trial LORD SPENS has called for the conviction of Mr Ernest Saunders and others in the first Guinness trial to be referred to the Appeal Court on the grounds that extensive publicity may have precluded a fair trial. The former merchant banker's demand comes nearly four months after he was awarded legal costs following the abandonment of his trial on charges relating to Guinness's share-support operation in the 1986 takeover of Distillers. Earl Ferrers, the Home Office minister, last night said in a written reply that Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, would 'take account of all relevant considerations'.</p>

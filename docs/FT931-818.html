			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Govett fights back from disaster - New managers are helping an ailing fund to rebound sharply / Investment Trusts IT IS UNUSUAL for an investment trust to be viewed as a recovery stock, but that is probably the best way of looking at Govett Strategic. After a disastrous period late in the 1980s, it is now being re-shaped by two new managers. The question is: have they done enough to restore its reputation? The trust was founded in 1923 as Border and Southern, and changed its name to Govett Strategic, adopting a new aggressive philosophy, in 1985. The strategy was for the trust to take very large stakes in small companies and to use them, on occasion, to provoke bid situations. Early in 1987, this philosophy was extraordinarily successful. Smaller companies were outperforming and the trust's gearing (via three debentures) was enhancing returns. Net assets per share rose nearly 71 per cent in the year to September 30 1987. But, as the graphs show, Govett Strategic fell off a cliff late in 1987. The gearing worked against it, small stocks suffered dramatically and, with large stakes, it was difficult for the trust to liquidate its holdings. In the year to September 30 1988, net assets fell by 44 per cent. There was more bad news in 1990 as the recession and the Gulf crisis hit the UK stock market - and small company shares, in particular. Net assets fell by 44 per cent again in 1990 and, at 206.9p, were lower than their 1985 level. This was not a situation which a board could be expected to endure. In April 1991, Govett Strategic brought in two new, young managers from NM Rothschild: Marc Gordon and Nigel Savage. It also promised shareholders the right to a vote in the winter of 1993 on whether to continue the trust. This helped to narrow the discount, which had risen to over 25 per cent but has traded recently in the 10-15 per cent range. Gordon and Savage found a trust which, they say, was unfocussed and structured poorly - 50 per cent of the portfolio was in stocks with market capitalisations of less than Pounds 100m. There were 11 companies where the trust had stakes of more than 10 per cent. The weeding process took time but is now largely complete. The 10 largest stocks in the revamped portfolio are: Blenheim Exhibition, Tilbury Douglas, Farnell Electronics, Microfilm Reprographics, Takare, Cookson Group, Shell, Medeva, Kalon and Davis Service. How successful has the change been? As the graph shows, the trust's September year-end did not help. At that time, the market had not yet responded to the benefits of Britain's exit from the exchange rate mechanism. Net assets per share were 198.8p, below their 1985 level. Since then, though, the trust has rebounded with a vengeance. Net assets per share are up nearly 30 per cent and investors enjoyed a 50.1 per cent return in the six months to March 1, according to Micropal (mid-market to mid-market, with net income re-invested). Over the past year, the trust is second in the UK general sector, with a rise of 27.1 per cent. Lewis Aaron, analyst at SG Warburg Securities, does not think Gordon and Savage have done enough, however. He points out that 45 per cent of the trust is owned by five institutions (including Robert Fleming, with 15.4 per cent), which might well look for a wind-up. But he feels there is the possibility of a smaller, successor trust. Hamish Buchan, of NatWest Securities, says the 'jury is still out' on Govett's revamp. He points out that there is a 'poison pill' in the Pounds 95m of debentures which the trust has outstanding. These are trading above par value so would cost extra to redeem - this would knock off another 8p-10p in the event of a wind-up. So, there is likely to be some vigorous debate about the trust's future when the wind-up vote comes due towards the end of this year. Key facts. The trust has gross assets of Pounds 362m and net assets of Pounds 266m. As of March 24 the net asset value was 272p, putting the shares, at 237p, on a discount of 13 per cent. The yield was 3.8 per cent. The management fee is 0.375 per cent of assets, with a further 0.125 per cent if the trust outperforms the All-Share index by 1 per cent. Board. The chairman is Alan McLintock, the chairman of Woolwich building society. Other directors include Bryan Himes, a former general manager of ICI; John Kay, professor of economics at the London Business School; George Nissen, an adviser to Morgan Grenfell; and Michael Orr, chairman of Molins. Directors with Govett connections are Martin Beaver, Mark Cornwall-Jones and William Govett. Savings scheme and Pep details.

Although the trust is Pepable, Govett has no specific plan related to it.</p>

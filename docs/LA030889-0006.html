			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> LAWMAKER FAULTS BUSH DRUG WAR POLICY  </P> <P> Rep. Charles B. Rangel (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House Select Committee on  Narcotics, charged that President Bush has failed to make the war on drugs a  priority in the nation's foreign policy and has sown confusion among South  American leaders. Fresh from a meeting in Ecuador with more than 200 officials  from five Andean nations, the congressman said it was "embarrassing" to talk  with his South American counterparts about the U.S. commitment to battling  drugs. "They want leadership from Bush -- they are pushing for a drug summit,"  he said. Rangel said the Bush Administration continues to treat the fight  against drugs almost exclusively as a law enforcement problem when it should be  at the top of the foreign policy agenda. The Administration is still not  prepared to use discussions on restructuring Latin American debt, as well as on  military aid, to press for pledges from South American governments to wipe out  drug production, he said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Leader President Saddam Husayn, may God protect and  preserve him, has chaired a Cabinet meeting. The Cabinet  discussed, within the course charted by his excellency for its  actions and discussions, subjects related to improving  production, efficient performance, flexibility and quick  response in the administrative field, and fairness and balance  between duties and rights.    The Cabinet discussed a plan to produce and improve seeds,  executed by al-Iba' Agricultural Research Center, which this  year achieved self-sufficiency in the production of potato seeds  and is seeking to achieve self-sufficiency in the production of  seeds for some vegetables and legumes. The Cabinet decided to  support al-Iba' Center with the necessary financial funds to  maintain the link between the center and potato growers.    The Cabinet also discussed the situation of the cooperative  movement in the country, its structures, and the proposals made  to develop it. In this regard, the leader president, may God  protect him, stressed the need for discussing how the  cooperative societies can develop their own resources and not  turn to state support except in emergency cases. He said we  must distinguish between incorrect implementations and the lack  of correct or fair programs. The cooperative movement, he said,  must play its role among the people within the concept of  cooperation.    His excellency urged the ministers, saying: When you propose  a law or an amendment to a law, your main concern must be how  this law or amendment will achieve justice and how will it take  into consideration the interests of all people in a fair way.  Any law that ignores this basic aspect or includes an  accumulation of forbidden things, particularly the unnecessary  ones, will help create a trend to violate it. The application  of a fair law, in which obligations and rights are balanced and  clear, will not only achieve justice, but will also ease the  pressure on courts.    His excellency said: We must also take note that certain  policies and laws are right in certain circumstances. But when  the circumstances change, we must set a new policy, a course,  and legislation must correspond to our new circumstances instead  of harming the citizen and the state and not achieving the  justice required by the new circumstance.    His excellency added: Each minister must review the laws  within the context of this course, which will make one take  pride in the state and belonging to it. Proposals to consider  these laws must be made. We still have work to build upon and  we can do this as quickly as we can.</p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / DTI will talk only to large lobby groups, Heseltine says ACCESS TO government ministers is likely to be curtailed for a large number of trade associations as a result of a policy to restrict contact to a smaller number of 'lead associations.' The policy, disclosed in a speech to the Confederation of British Industry by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, would apply only to the industry department - the main channel of government contact for most trade associations. The aim is to improve the poor quality of industrial lobbying and reduce the plethora of sometimes conflicting voices demanding the attention of ministers. Smaller trade associations may be required to group together in loose federations or merge with larger, more powerful organisations, or risk losing membership. Mr Heseltine said: 'Too many trade associations are narrowly focused, poorly resourced and ill-equipped to help the industries they represent. 'In future, where a lead association had emerged in a sector and the subject of the proposals is relevant to the whole sector, or wider, my officials would refer to me only proposals from that lead associa-tion. 'Where these representations were received from elsewhere - even from other trade associations in the sector - my officials would refer them back to the lead association for co-ordination.' Mr Heseltine said this might create difficulties but 'there might be no better way to build a single powerful effective unit to represent the sector'. He singled out the Chemical Industries Association as the kind of powerfully resourced association ministers might prefer to deal with. Engineering companies by comparison were represented by almost 50 associations and 'one sometimes wonders why'. Mr Heseltine said: 'There is a general assumption that trade associations in Britain are weaker and less influential than their counterparts in the US and many industrial sectors in Europe.' In future, ministers and officials would be more frank in criticising the quality of associations to the industrialists that paid for their services. Mr Heseltine was particularly critical of the way many trade associations had failed to 'have thought through the implications of the growing European dimension' of business. Mr Heseltine announced a new competition under which trade associations could receive a total of Pounds 500,000. Awards will be made for the '10 or so' best proposals for establishing 'benchmark' clubs, under which companies pool information on the best ways of improving competitiveness in areas such as purchasing or materials handling.</p>

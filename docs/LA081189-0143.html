Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> RUSHDIE WAS TERRORIST'S 1ST CHOICE  </P> <P> The Shiite Muslim suicide bomber who wounded five Israeli soldiers in south  Lebanon said in a videotape released today that his dream had been to kill  British author Salman Rushdie.  </P> <P> "I wish I had executed the death sentence of the hypocrite agent Salman  Rushdie, fulfilling the edict of Imam Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, but God  graced me with the operation against Israel," Asaad Berro said in his  videotaped final testament.  </P> <P> Khomeini died in June four months after ordering Muslims to kill Rushdie for  blaspheming Islam in his novel "The Satanic Verses." Several pro-Iranian groups  in Lebanon said they would carry out the command.  </P></p>

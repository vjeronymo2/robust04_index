			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Coal bill provokes wrath of landowners The Conservative party faces a protest campaign from some of its most traditional supporters - owner-occupier farmers and landed gentry - over the government's policies on state industry sell-offs. The Country Landowners' Association yesterday threatened to 'hound and harass' the government over the coal industry privatisation bill because of its 'creeping erosion of land and property rights'. The CLA, with 50,000 members in England and Wales, is angry at the way the government has passed compulsory powers of access to and acquisition of land from publicly owned industries to the private sector. The bill's present provisions have heightened that concern, and the CLA is urging members to protest to Conservative associations. 'Our members are getting fed up with subsidising shareholders in what were once publicly owned industries,' said Mr John Henderson, vice chairman of the CLA's Yorkshire branch, its largest. 'There is a case for compulsory powers where land is needed for the public good, but privatisation should not mean a licence to rip off private landowners to subsidise dividends paid to shareholders of private companies.' Mr Henderson - chairman of the Coal Liaison Group, set up by the CLA and others to try to amend the coal bill - said he did not think the government understood the anger among his members. 'Let's have a level playing field for all concerned,' he said.</p>

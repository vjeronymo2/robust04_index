			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Wall Street securities housesprosper in tough times: Fees, broking and investment banking help firms ride out turbulent markets After three years of favourable financial market conditions, you would think that the higher interest rates, lower securities prices and volatile currency markets of the past few months would have severely dented Wall Street's profits in the first quarter. Think again. While many US securities houses reported lower quarterly trading profits because of the deterioration in market conditions, most were able to make up for it with higher revenues from fee-based businesses, and solid earnings from retail broking and investment banking. Mr John Keefe, an independent securities industry analyst in New York, estimates that securities houses together earned about Dollars 1.7bn pre-tax in the three months ended March. That is below the Dollars 2.3bn of a year ago, and the Dollars 2bn in the final quarter of 1993, 'but it's still a pretty good number'. Smith Barney Shearson, Lehman Brothers, Dean Witter, Charles Schwab, Merrill Lynch and Bear Stearns all posted higher earnings. Merrill Lynch and Bear Stearns even came out of the turbulent quarter showing a bigger profit on their trading activities. Only two big firms, Salomon Brothers and PaineWebber, disappointed investors. The resilient performance from most US securities houses contrasted with lower trading revenues at several large commercial banks. At Citicorp, the biggest US bank, trading income plummeted Dollars 400m to just Dollars 71m as turbulent fixed-income and currency markets took their toll. Bankers Trust saw trading revenues tumble from Dollars 449m to just Dollars 14m, while trading income at JP Morgan fell Dollars 114m to Dollars 356m. The main difference between the commercial banks and the Wall Street firms was that the latter were not as deeply involved in currency markets and emerging market bonds. Also, banks do not have the sort of stable fee-based businesses which the securities houses have lately developed. In the latest quarter, these recurring revenues helped the securities industry ride out volatile markets. Fees from managing clients' funds rose sharply at firms with sizeable asset management operations, such as Merrill Lynch (where fees rose 23 per cent to a record Dollars 444m) and Smith Barney (from Dollars 22m to Dollars 182m). Wall Street's earnings were also cushioned by healthy brokerage commissions. Trading activity on behalf of investors was at record levels: volume on the New York Stock Exchange averaged 312m shares a day during the quarter. At Merrill Lynch, growth in mergers and acquisitions and other advisory business offset the downturn in underwriting. Following Smith Barney's recent aggressive hiring of executives from rival houses, its earnings from investment banking jumped 62 per cent to Dollars 196m. While the brokers, asset managers and investment bankers mostly enjoyed the first quarter, Wall Street's traders had the toughest time with sharply rising US interest rates rocking stock, bond and currency markets in February and March. Salomon sustained the most damage, posting a meagre profit of Dollars 66m in the wake of a Dollars 173m loss on its market-making activities, and its very short-term trading strategies. The firm, however, made a profit on its longer term trading business. There are signs that profits growth is likely to slow further in the coming months. Merrill Lynch's revenues, for example, had begun to decline in the latter half of the first quarter, while Bear Stearns recently warned that it incurred trading losses earlier this month. The underwriting market also seems to be cooling. Rising interest rates and unsettled stock markets have begun to deter companies from issuing new debt or equity. The calendar for company flotations, or initial public offerings, is less crowded than for some time, spelling trouble for firms which earn their most lucrative fees underwriting IPOs. The revived mergers and acquisitions business, however, may partly compensate for any underwriting slowdown. A number of large corporate deals have been concluded in recent months, and the drop in stock prices could make more companies potential takeover targets. However, few expect 1994 to sustain the industry's streak of three consecutive years of record-breaking earnings.</p>

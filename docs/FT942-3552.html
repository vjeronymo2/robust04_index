			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / International Company News: Unidare in red after provision of IPounds 8m Unidare, the Dublin-based industrial group, fell into the red with pre-tax losses of IPounds 4.6m (Pounds 4.71m) in the six months to March 31 after a IPounds 8m provision to dispose of its wire businesses. Profits last time were IPounds 2.68m. The interim dividend, however, is lifted to 4.5p (4.4p), because, before the provision, operating profits rose 26 per cent to IPounds 3.89m (IPounds 3.08m) on sales of IPounds 84.8m (IPounds 63.3m). The wire businesses recorded losses of IPounds 700,000 in the six month period. Mr Peter Gray, finance director, said the proposed divestment was an important piece of refocusing for the company and would reinforce welding and heating as Unidare's core businesses. After the disposal, nearly 85 per cent of the company's turnover will be generated by these two sectors. He anticipated the second half would show improvement subject to the elimination of the losses from the wire division. Mr Gray said the welding division continued to perform well, mainly due to the integration of Nasco, the US welding distribution business. In the UK increased exports pushed up sales although the outlook was 'patchy', he said. Unidare maintained its share of the UK's storage heater market although profits from that division were below previous years. Losses per share stood at 26.53p (earnings 12.52p). The shares closed 10p down yesterday at 335p.</p>

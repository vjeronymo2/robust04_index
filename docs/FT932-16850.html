			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Man in the News: The seeds of a political storm - Raymond Plant Lord Plant of Highfield, professor of Politics at Southampton University, is an unlikely harbinger of political revolution. Politics professors are traditionally long on academic theory and short in their impact on the grubby world of realpolitik. Yet the soft-spoken, self-effacing Raymond Plant appears to have launched an upheaval that could alter the UK political landscape irreversibly. For he is the chairman of the Labour party inquiry on electoral reform, which will publish its report later this month. It will recommend that the first-past-the-post system used to elect MPs should be replaced by a form of proportional representation. If the report is adopted by the Labour party, Her Majesty's opposition could enter the next election campaign committed to constitutional change that would alter the face of British government. And if Lord Plant's report is rejected by Labour, the storm which would follow could wreck the party's chances of re-election. For electoral reform is an issue which divides Labour as fundamentally as its relationship with the unions. This week, the opening shots were fired in a new round of the party's internal strife when the committee met to finalise its recommendations. Lord Plant resisted pleas to produce a report setting out a menu of options for the party to choose from. Instead, he was determined to make firm recommendations, the mandate he had been given when the inquiry was launched in late 1990 by Mr Neil Kinnock, then Labour leader. The suggestion that Plant should chair the committee came originally from Mr Roy Hattersley, then Labour's deputy leader and a staunch opponent of PR. Hattersley had found discussions with Plant helpful in writing his political testament, Choose Freedom. Lord Plant is one of Britain's leading political philosophers, with well-regarded books on Hegel, community politics and modern political theory to his name. His unique selling proposition as chairman, however, was that he had given no great thought to electoral reform before and could thus be presented as having an open mind. Mr Kinnock's strategy in setting up the Plant committee was to bury a contentious issue in a slow-moving inquiry. Although it has since emerged that Kinnock favoured PR, endorsing it before the general election might have looked like a tacit admission that Labour could not win on its own. The inquiry would take two years, so that its work would be completed only after the election was won. If it came out in favour, the case could then be argued from a position of strength. The strategy seemed to work well at first. A carefully chosen committee of MPs, trade unionists, academics and party worthies was selected to work with Lord Plant. In summer 1991, the committee published a well-received interim report, examining all the options, their advantages and disadvantages. This method of working is typical of Lord Plant. His forte is in analysing complex arguments, filleting out points for and against a particular position and then presenting a few simple options for the listener to choose between. He is also unusual among politically committed thinkers in his willingness to engage with contrary points of view. Lord Plant's distinctive contribution to thinking on the left has been to grapple with the intellectual challenge of the new right. Before it became fashionable among Labour intellectuals Lord Plant accepted the liberal critique of economic planning set out by Friedrich von Hayek. Yet his willingness to look at new ideas is firmly bedded in core Labour values, developed during his childhood in Grimsby where his father was a fireman, his mother a dinner lady. A late developer, Lord Plant failed the 11-plus and went into the secondary modern stream of a comprehensive. He took his philosophy degree at King's College, London, discovering his vocation in political philosophy only after abandoning plans to become an Anglican priest. His first job was teaching philosophy at Manchester University. In 1979, he took up his chair at Southampton where he has remained ever since. Though he has long since left the working-class community of Grimsby, Lord Plant remains wedded to egalitarian objectives. But he is also clear that the social conditions which produced two largely class-based political parties have now disappeared. In a more pluralistic society, he argues, a voting system is needed which is not designed simply to award victory to the party with the highest vote under the first-past-the-post system. The PR mechanism recommended by the Plant Inquiry is an untried system devised by Mr Dale Campbell-Savours MP. It was not Lord Plant's first choice, nor is it clear whether it will always produce a more proportional result than first-past-the-post (a similar electoral system produced a highly unproportional distribution of seats in the recent French general election). However, Lord Plant is content with the outcome, and believes it is a step towards an electoral system which is more appropriate for the 1990s. It is also the option which involves the minimum disruption of existing constituencies and is thus least likely to encounter opposition from MPs worried about losing their seats. It is unlikely that all of Labour's frontbench will agree with the report even though electoral reform has gathered support in the party. When Kinnock resigned, PR lost the implicit - if undeclared - backing of the leader. Mr John Smith, the new leader, is unconvinced of the wisdom of electoral reform, as are many of his Scottish colleagues. It is not hard to see why: Labour holds two-thirds of the seats in Scotland on just 39 per cent of the popular vote, and would lose seats on a fairer system. But the proponents of PR will not easily be silenced. Unless the party can resolve its differences over electoral reform, Lord Plant's efforts may prove academic.</p>

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Budget anxiety in north holds back confidence Many businesses view next week's Budget with trepidation, fearing that Tuesday's half-point cut in interest rates was a 'softener' for tax increases, the Confederation of British Industry in the north of England said yesterday. Mr Arthur Foord, northern region CBI director, said after yesterday's bi-monthly meeting of the regional council that anxiety about the Budget was holding down confidence among the CBI's 1,500 member companies in his area. Members feared that tax increases would damage the 'patchy and fragile' recovery. Mr Foord said conditions for businesses in north-east England and Cumbria had continued their slow improvement, but companies doing well tended to be those seeking new markets, particularly outside western Europe. Exports account for nearly 45 per cent of the north's manufactured output, the highest regional proportion in the UK. Mr Foord said that, in spite of the low level of interest rates, little investment was planned. The reason was not lack of finance, but of confidence. Yesterday's meeting was less gloomy than those held in the summer, but optimism remained below early-1993 levels, he said. Separately, manufacturers in Yorkshire and Humberside have confirmed 'an unsteady and patchy emergence from recession', according to an Engineering Employers Federation survey of its 300 members in the region. The EEF said yesterday that, after stalling in September, the trend in orders picked up to levels last seen in January, but this was not enough to take up much spare capacity. Mr Ian Hughes, director of the EEF's Yorkshire and Humberside Association, said industry was using an average of only 69 per cent of capacity. Home orders were volatile in October and November, with 41 per cent of companies reporting an improvement and 24 per cent a decline. Although exports picked up for 25 per cent of companies and fell for 18 per cent, the majority - 57 per cent - reported no change. Nearly 75 per cent reported unchanged investment plans. With profit margins tightening under competition, this caution was almost inevitable, given that 31 per cent of companies suffered a decline in profitability against 16 per cent which reported an improvement. Cashflow deteriorated for 20 per cent, with only 16 per cent saying it was better. Mr Hughes said the large volume of spare capacity made it unlikely that any Budget incentives would encourage much investment. Confidence was poor. Just over half the companies expect no improvement in total orders in the next three months - and 20 per cent are forecasting a decline. Nearly 55 per cent expect no change in capacity utilisation and 21 per cent expect to use less. One bright spot is that 62 per cent say they will keep to their present number of employees and 19 per cent forecast taking more on. However, 60 per cent expect no improvement in the economy.</p>

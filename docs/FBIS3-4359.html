A spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office under  the State Council made this statement when asked about the  revisions presumptuously agreed by the Hong Kong authorities on  the draft immunity regulation on land in the new territories.  The revisions have caused strong protests from original local  residents.    The spokesman pointed out that the concept of "original  residents in the New Territories" and the lawful rights of  original residents, which were written into the Joint  Declaration and the Basic Law, should not be removed.    The Hong Kong authorities should take the protests of the  residents into consideration and handle the issue properly  through full consultation with the original local residents in  accordance with the Basic Law, thus avoiding man-made social  instability and separation, he said.    The spokesman noted that the British authorities had  announced in 1898 that all land in the New Territories belonged  to the British royal house following its forced lease of the  land through unequal treaties, depriving original residents of  the New Territories of their land-owning rights.    That announcement was persistently resisted by local  residents. As a result, the later draft immunity regulations on  land in the New Territories ruled that farmland owners need only  hand in nominal rents.    Annex III to the Sino-British Joint Declaration rules that  the rent on rural land leased by original residents in the New  Territories "shall remain unchanged so long as the property is  held by that person (one who was in 1898 a resident of an  established village in Hong Kong) or by one of his lawful  successors in the male line."</p>

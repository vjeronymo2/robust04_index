			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / American Express to cancel O&amp;Y lease AMERICAN EXPRESS, the financial services group, has abandoned plans to move to Canary Wharf, the insolvent office project built by Olympia &amp; York in London's Docklands. The company's lawyers are preparing a termination notice that will cancel its lease for 20 Cabot Square. The action stems from O&amp;Y's failure to provide incentives agreed under the lease. 'It is our definite intention to serve the notice because O&amp;Y cannot fulfil its contractual obligations,' said American Express. American Express warned the developer in June that it was owed Pounds 22m at the time Canary Wharf went into administration on May 28. The debt was related to the fitting-out costs of the Canary Wharf building and indemnities against continuing liability on existing premises. At the end of June, a Canadian judge temporarily blocked American Express's move to pull out of the project. The judge considered that the entire Canary Wharf project could be irreparably harmed if American Express was allowed to pull out. But at the start of this month, a Canadian court freed American Express to serve its termination notice. The group has not decided on a revised plan for its premises. It had planned to bring its 1,500 staff under one roof at Canary Wharf but may stay for a period in its present premises, which mostly have unexpired leases. Its decision to pull out of Canary Wharf may increase the likelihood of other tenants cancelling their leases. Although leases have been signed on 60 per cent of the first phases, only 14 per cent of the tenants are installed. Texaco, another prominent tenant, say talks with the project's administrators concerning its occupancy are going well. Property, Page 33</p>

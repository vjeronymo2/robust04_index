			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Letter: Insurmountable cost barrier faced by rail freight operators Sir, Richard Tomkins ('How freight hopes have finally been derailed', September 1) can only be congratulated for highlighting the plight of British Rail and other would-be rail freight operators. As long as rail freight rates have to cover full commercial costs, ie have to pay for rail freight infrastructure as well (or are even required to earn a return on railway assets), while road users are offered unlimited access to their respective transport system in exchange for a negligible annual licence fee, an insurmountable barrier to entry remains in place. On top of this comes the complete disregard for external - ie, social - costs, such as congestion or pollution costs. The political unwillingness to level the playing field not only prevents a commercially viable rail freight industry. By virtually subsidising road transport the government hinders competition, increases economic inefficiency and promotes the ecologically most damaging mode of transport.

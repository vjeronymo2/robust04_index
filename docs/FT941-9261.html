			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Fiat talks on job cuts restart After more than three weeks of sustained industrial unrest, talks resumed yesterday between the Fiat management and unions on lay-offs and job cuts in the Turin-based group's Italian automotive plants, writes Robert Graham in Rome. Resumption of talks followed a series of behind-the-scenes initiatives by Mr Gini Giugni, labour minister, and reflect little softening of Fiat's tough line. Mr Giugni is understood to be offering large-scale early retirement, plus government funding for the development of an electric car, as a compromise to Fiat's decision to cut 5 per cent of its workforce and lay off up to a further 10 per cent for two years. The unions are divided on the idea of early retirement. The labour minister's intervention underscored the Ciampi government's concern to avoid a serious confrontation between the unions and the country's biggest private sector employer in the run-up to the March general elections. Since Fiat decided to implement plans to trim its 95,000 workforce in mid-January the group's plants have been hit by frequent strikes.</p>

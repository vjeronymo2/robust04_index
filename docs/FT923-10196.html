			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Bogus tour agents vanish with Pounds 1m THREE Frenchmen who masqueraded as travel agents in the UK and advertised in Belgium and France have disappeared with payments estimated at more than Pounds 1m. The men, who set up an office in north London three months ago and sold non-existent airline tickets and holidays, left the premises last Friday, according to Mr Steve Nicholls, principal trading standards officer at Camden Borough Council. The men said they would return on Tuesday, but have apparently vacated their offices and are believed to have left Britain, Mr Nicholls said. 'We have no knowledge of any flights and holidays that have been successful,' he said. Belgian customers were the first to report the men's disappearance and Belgian police are investigating. It later emerged that French customers had also booked flights and holidays through the office. Camden council received about 50 complaints between Monday and Wednesday, and the trading standards office is now directing complaints to Belgian and French police. 'The 50 complaints are only the tip of the iceberg,' Mr Nicholls said. It is believed that the advertisements, bookings and payments were all made on the Continent. The Metropolitan and City of London police are not taking part in the investigation. The men, two of whom are in their late 20s and one who is in his late 30s, used an office in Lissenden Gardens, Tufnell Park. They lived in rented rooms in West Hampstead. They advertised on the Continent in local newspapers and on local radio as two separate companies, Branch &amp; Co in Belgium, and Notais &amp; Coin France. Neither was a registered company. The British consulate in Brussels has been contacted by six people who booked holidays with Branch &amp; Co. One man from the US said he had booked a holiday and paid a BFr50,000 deposit - just under Pounds 1,000. Belgian police have put a restraining order on a Belgian account, according to the consulate. Mr Francois Fonck, who is leading the investigation from the Police Judiciaire in Belgium, said it was believed the men had used false names, and it was not known in which country they now were. THE pre-tax profits of Britain's top 30 air tour operators increased by 160 per cent to Pounds 104.8m last year, the Civil Aviation Authority said yesterday. The increased profits were achieved on turnover of Pounds 2.74bn, only marginally up on the 1990 figure of Pounds 2.73bn.  Pre-tax profit as a percentage of turnover was 3.8 per cent, the highest level achieved since 1983. The Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) said the average level of profit per holiday was Pounds 11.50. The authority said that 24 of the top 30 companies made profits last year totalling Pounds 110.9m, while six made total losses of Pounds 6.1m. The 30 top companies account for nearly 80 per cent of licensed air holidays sold in the UK. The authority said the remainder of the industry achieved similar levels of profitability. The increased profits of the the top 30 companies followed the collapse last year of the International Leisure Group, then the second-biggest operator. Its demise allowed the remaining companies to maintain their prices and prevented big discounting that was a feature of previous years.</p>

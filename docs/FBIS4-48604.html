			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Edyth Bulbring] </F>   [Text] President Nelson Mandela this week began to gather  around him personal staff who will be his voice, his ears and  the guardians of the most privileged secrets of the highest  office in the land.    Those appointed include:    -- Professor Jakes Gerwel, the former rector and  vice-chancellor of the University of the Western Cape who has  been appointed as Mr Mandela's director-general.    -- Mr Ahmed Kathrada, the Rivonia trialist who was  imprisoned  on Robben Island along with Mr Mandela. His job in the  president's office involves acting as Mr Mandela's liaison with  Parliament. Mr Kathrada has a reputation for being a backroom  worker totally loyal to Mr Mandela.    -- Mr Joe Netshitenzhe, who is also called Peter Mayibuye,  will be employed as the chief director of communications in Mr  Mandela's office. Mr Netshitenzhe, 38, is considered one of the  bright young intellectuals in the ANC and served on the  organisation's Negotiations Commission and the Electoral  Commission. He edited the ANC's propaganda publication Mayibuye  since 1980 and worked on Radio Freedom before then. He is also  a member of the ANC's national working committee.    -- Mrs Mary Mxadana, an employee of the SA [South Africa]  Council of Churches for more than 10 years, has been appointed  as Mr Mandela's private secretary. From 1992, she headed the  Ecumenical Monitoring Programme in SA (Empsa), which brought out  500 monitors from church organisations abroad to monitor  violence and later the elections. She also has a good voice,  having been one of the members of the choir which sang at Mr  Mandela's inauguration.</p>

			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Miners win rethink on pay-off deal British Coal is to give 2,700 miners and pit officials a second chance to agree a job-flexibility and redundancy-terms package. This follows a judge's ruling that their decision to reject it may have been influenced by union advice and 'an element of confusion at the time'. The corporation had previously refused to re-offer the package in spite of strong pleas from some of the miners. Yesterday's decision to do so was viewed with mixed feelings by private-sector companies considering bids for British Coal at privatisation later this year. Although they welcomed the possibility of the 2,700 miners joining the 9,600 who accepted the agreement to work longer shifts, there was concern that they would have to pay more redundancy money in future. British Coal's package provides for payments of up to Pounds 27,000 for employees made redundant before March 1998. This compares with less than Pounds 7,000 available to miners who have not signed the deal. One prospective bidder said: 'It runs into tens of millions of pounds. Nor will we be able simply to end the scheme in 1998. We will have to either buy it out or continue it. 'All of this will have to be taken into account in the amount of money we bid for British Coal.' The package provides one-off sums of Pounds 6,000 to be paid immediately. In return for this and the redundancy terms miners must agree to work rostered shifts of up to 12 hours, compared with the current limit of seven and a half. British Coal's decision to reopen the offer follows a ruling by Judge Patrick Medd, adjudicating in a corporation disputes procedure, that members of the Nacods deputies union should be given until August 31 to sign up. The corporation said it wanted to be even-handed with employees, all of whom would now have until the end of August to sign up. Nacods said its members had been placed under duress to agree the package. The judge's tribunal ruled that there was no duress because the corporation had been trying to spell out the advantages of the package against the disadvantages. However, it ruled that it would be unfair to penalise the Nacods members who did not accept the package because of union advice.</p>

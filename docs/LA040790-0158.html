			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOB HOPE'S LAND HOLDINGS  </P> <P> In response to Ward Grant's letter on Hope's mountain lands, March 27:  </P> <P> I would like to clarify a few things with Hope's Jordan Ranch controversy.  There is no donation of land to the park service -- not even 1 single acre.  </P> <P> The developer is proposing an "exchange" of 800 acres of mostly rocky,  undevelopable, goat country for 60 acres of easily accessible national  parkland. This 60 acres will be used for a developer's highway through the  wilderness park unit of Cheeseboro Canyon.  </P> <P> The purpose of this exchange is for a massive, up-zoned development in Jordan  Ranch. The proposed PGA golf course will be "plopped" on one of the last oak  forests in Southern California. Without parkland access, the developer could  not put 1,152 homes and the golf course where 14 ranches are currently allowed.  </P> <P> For the National Park Service to be a party to this proposed developer's  highway which will move 3 million cubic yards of earth is scandalous!  </P> <P> If Mr. Hope wants to donate 1,000 acres to the park service, with no strings  attached, then I will be happy to thank him for this gift. Let's not call a  business exchange a donation!  </P> <P> ROSIE McCABE  </P> <P> Agoura  </P></p>

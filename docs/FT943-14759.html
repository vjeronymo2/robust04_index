			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Survey of Argentina (5): Growth shelters an inefficient system - The financial sector is facing heavier borrowing costs and a rise in non-performing loans Bankers are not popular anywhere. In Argentina, as in most other countries, they are accused of a multitude of sins - gouging, resisting change, inefficiency and harbouring an anti-industry bias. President Carlos Menem vented his frustration in a speech to bankers in June, saying: 'Deregulation of the financial system was not done for banks to make more money, but for money to cost less.' He warned that 'business cannot survive without reasonable financial costs and its fall sooner or later will drag the banks down'. However, Argentina's financial system is maturing. Interest rates are falling, deposits are growing, lending is expanding and maturities are stretching out. The capital markets, too, are slowly developing in breadth and sophistication. The question is whether the pace of change is sufficient and whether the system can withstand the stresses of change. For now, banks are making easy money from Argentina's rapid growth and access to international financial circuits. Banco Galicia, Argentina's largest quoted bank, earned an estimated net profit of Dollars 57.1m last year on assets of Dollars 2.76bn. Banco Frances, the second-largest listed bank, earned Dollars 53m in the same period, returning a strong 4 per cent on assets. Banks raise money on international financial markets and re-lend it in Argentina at substantial spreads. Until recently banks could fund at 8 per cent but charged retail customers and small companies 15-25 per cent interest in dollar terms. But borrowing costs increased sharply after the US Federal Reserve began raising interest rates on February 4. Banco del Sud, a regional bank, borrowed Dollars 50m early in February at 8.125 per cent. When it returned for more in June, it had to pay two percentage points more for a similar Dollars 50m bond issue. Still, analysts reckon banks will go on making good profits for some time to come. There is a danger that banks' assets and liabilities are becoming mismatched. They have borrowed in hard currency but onlent it mainly to borrowers with peso revenues. The financial system has liabilities of Dollars 68.8bn, of which Dollars 36.1bn is in foreign currency. And liabilities are normally of 3-5 years but banks' peso assets are beginning to stretch out for much longer. Bad loans are increasing fast. Non-performing loans at Banco Frances have risen to 6.0 per cent of total net loans this year from 3.6 per cent last year. But bankers are optimistic. Eduardo Escasany, president of Banco Galicia and head of the national bank association ADEBA, says expansion is by no means exhausted. He points out that although money supply has quadrupled since the launch of the convertibility plan in April 1991, it is still equivalent to only 22 per cent of GDP. The financial system's deposits have grown impressively - to Dollars 41.04bn in May from Dollars 8.44bn in April 1991. Spreads have also come down: Banco Galicia's average margin dropped to 13 percentage points in 1993 from 17 in 1992 from 32 in 1991. However, Mr Escasany says banks are stuck with high operating costs and hold large amounts of cash at branches and cope with frequent armed robberies because Argentines still insist on using cash - a habit born of inflation, tax evasion and fear of bouncing cheques. He also complains that banks must pay the bank workers union 2 per cent of revenues to fund social and health services. Analysts would add that banks are still burdened by bureaucracy, overstaffing and unimaginative, unskilled managers. Another distortion is the presence of even more inefficient public banks. Half the country's banking industry is publicly-owned. Argentina lacks an integrated national banking network. Provincially-owned banks or small co-operative banks dominate lending in the interior. As a result, companies outside major cities pay higher interest rates. Strong growth has masked these inefficiencies and prevented a banking crisis, a frequent by-product of past economic stabilisation programmes. But what will happen when growth falters? Although analysts say bank profits would naturally be damaged by a slowdown, they doubt the system's solvency would be affected seriously because the largest banks are strongly capitalised. Change is also slow in coming to the narrowly-based and highly speculative capital markets. Derivatives and securitisation are still in their infancy. Still, the flood of foreign money into the stock market has brought greater professionalism and a longer view on investment. By one estimate, foreign investors now hold 60 per cent of the Buenos Aires Exchange's float, worth about Dollars 6.5bn. But the market is still held back by a lack of liquidity - turnover rarely exceeds Dollars 30m a day - caused in part by a shortage of paper. Private companies, invariably family-owned firms, are unwilling to sell equity for fear of losing control. Although the number of listed companies has declined to 161 from 171 in 1992, bankers are confident that companies will be driven to raise equity capital as they exhaust traditional sources of finance - debt and retained earnings. Perhaps this year's greatest disappointment is the chaos surrounding the introduction of a private pension fund system which economy minister Domingo Cavallo hoped would channel Dollars 3bn a year into capital markets. However, disorganisation, frequent rule changes and the suspicion of contributors is turning an important reform into a fiasco.</p>

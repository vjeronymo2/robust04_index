			<p>BFN     [Text] In a bid to win China's cooperation in dealing with  the issue of North Korea's suspected development of nuclear  arms, the government reaffirmed on 3 June to seek a moderate  step like a resolution warning or criticizing North Korea in the  UN Security Council. The government reaffirmed to seek the  moderate step based on its perception that China's cooperation  is indispensable for the UN Security Council to take effective  measures against North Korea, and "North Korea's unclear issue  has now become an issue, the resolution of which depends on  China" (according to a Foreign Ministry source).    The government, however, analyzes that the United States may  seek a resolution imposing economic sanctions against North  Korea in the UN Security Council out of irritation and  disappointment with the recent situation. The government's  judgment is that Japan has no choice but to enforce economic  sanctions in concert with the United States if they are imposed.    The government has sent Shunji Yanai, chief of the Foreign  Policy Bureau of the Foreign Ministry, to Washington to attend  emergency tripartite talks to be held by officials from Japan,  the United States, and South Korea. During the talks, the  officials will examine a draft of a resolution to be adopted by  the UN Security Council and to be acceptable to China. Will the  three nations seek a resolution criticizing North Korea in the  UN Security Council or will they seek a resolution hinting at  additional actions, including the imposition of economic  sanctions against North Korea, in the UN Security Council? The  three nations are likely to discuss details of concrete measures  against North Korea while watching how China is moving.    Japan-U.S. talks, U.S.-South Korea talks, and the  Japan-U.S.-ROK tripartite talks are planned to be held. In  addition to those talks, there is a high possibility that the  three nations will hold their individual talks with China.  Presently under study is Japan's proposal that special  inspections should be conducted at two nuclear facilities that  North Korea has yet to declare to the International Atomic  Energy Agency in a bid to break the deadlock over the issue of  North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons.    Administrative Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito, who  returned home hurriedly on 2 June from his foreign trip, has met  separately with Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the opposition  Social Democratic Party of Japan, and Ryutaro Hashimoto,  chairman of the Policy Research Council of the opposition  Liberal Democratic Party. During the meetings, Saito said:  "Japan plans to buy time by seeking a resolution criticizing  North Korea. The United States may ask Japan to support its  proposal for the economic sanctions against North Korea. I  instructed Yanai, chief of the Foreign Policy Bureau, before he  was sent to Washington to go along with the U.S. proposal if the  U.S. side asks the Japanese side to support the proposal at the  talks."</p>

			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Chaos uncovered at Argentinian ministry An investigation by government auditors has uncovered cases of gross maladministration and possible corruption at Argentina's Health and Social Action Ministry. The Auditor General's office has found that some 40-50 per cent of the ministry's Dollars 957.3m (Pounds 651m) 1993 budget was not spent. Some 2,000 authorisations for cash payments are missing. More than 80 per cent of the budget for the elderly had not been spent. Mr Alberto Mazza, health and social action minister, rejected the findings, saying they only covered the January-October period. The auditor's investigation, leaked to the media yesterday, coincides with demands that the government improve its chaotic social policies at a time when unemployment and social tension are rising as a result of its economic reforms. The government's social services budget rose 4 per cent this year to Dollars 25.63bn, but execution of spending programmes is widely agreed to be disorganised and wasteful. Mr Domingo Cavallo, the powerful economy minister, now seems intent on using disarray at the Health and Social Action Ministry to extend his control over social policy. As local governments now carried out most social spending, he would set up a 'system of punishment and rewards. Those working well would be given more federal resources.</p>

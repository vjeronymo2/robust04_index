Confirming the outbreak of the disease yesterday, the Elgeyo  Marakwet Medical Officer of Health, Dr. David Koech, said three  people died in Kapkosom sub-Location, five in Molol sub-Location  and three at Kocholwa.    Dr. Koech said two people were admitted at Plateau Mission  Hospital in Uasin Gishu District. He appealed for calm among  wananchi because the disease was under control.    Dr. Koech said a team of medical personnel from Iten  District  Hospital had been sent to immunise the people in the area and  urged wananchi to go for immunisation at Kocholwa Trading  Centre. The immunisation exercise will take four days.    The outbreak of meningitis was last reported in Kisii in  early October last year when it killed four people from one  family at Riangoncho village. Several other people including  school children were admitted to hospital for treatment.    Earlier in September, three school children were reported to  have died following an outbreak of meningitis in Soi, Elgeyo  Marakwet District. Six other children were admitted to Plateau  Mission Hospital for treatment.    At the time, Dr. Koech said the children who died from the  disease were aged between three and nine and that he had toured  the area and made sure that public health officers took  preventive measures.    A vaccination campaign was carried out and Dr. Koech said  public health experts would keep the situation under constant  surveillance to curb further spread of the disease.    Earlier last year, a massive yellow fever vaccination drive  was conducted in the area and neighbouring Baringo where more  than 500,000 people were given the jabs.    [Passage omitted]</p>

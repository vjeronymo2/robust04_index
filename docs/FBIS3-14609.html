			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By P.V. Vivekanand, JORDAN TIMES staff reporter] </F>   [Text] Amman--A German vessel was turned away early Monday  [28 March] from the Gulf of Aqaba by the enforcers of the  international sanctions against Iraq despite an agreement under  which cargo aboard the ship was supposed to have been inspected  at al-'Aqabah port, informed sources said.    They said the 13,000-tonne Skyman was denied entry after  inspectors aboard the American-led warships patrolling the Red  Sea insisted on their own interpretation of an agreement reached  with Jordan, the sources said.    Under the accord, the first of its kind since the sanctions  against Iraq went into force in August 1990, an inspector from  one of the U.S. warships was to aboard the Skyman at the Tiran  Straits in the mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba and come to the port  aboard the vessel to supervise the inspection of the cargo  unloaded at the port, the sources said.    "But instead of sending an inspector aboard the vessel, the  Americans insisted that the agreement was that a warship will  accompany the Skyman to al-'Aqabah," said one of the sources.    "The Jordanian government rejected the suggestion and hence  the ship was turned away," added the source, who, like others  who confirmed the incident, spoke on condition of anonymity.    According to another source, "Jordan rejected the American  suggestion since (the Kingdom) considered the entry of a ship  escorted by a warship into Jordanian waters as an infringement  of its sovereignty."    Furthermore, said the source, the American insistence on  sending a frigate to accompany the Skyman despite Jordan's  record of abiding by the sanctions against Iraq was also seen as  raising questions on the Kingdom's credibility and sincerity.    His Majesty King Husayn has repeatedly said that Jordan  would  not allow anyone to question its credibility and sincerity.    When it was known two days ago that the cargo aboard the  Skyman -- 3,000 tonnes of general cargo including steel rods and  animal feed -- was to be inspected on land at al-'Aqabah port  instead of the Tiran Straits, hopes were raised that it could be  the forerunner of an arrangement to move all cargo inspections  to port.    Under the proposed arrangement, a neutral international  agency would inspect all incoming and outgoing cargo for  violations of the sanctions against Iraq.    The Skyman was first turned away last Wednesday after four  inspections since March 19 failed to satisfy the "cargo  accessibility" demands of the inspectors.    Following the denial of entry, for the ship proceeded  towards  the Gulf Port of Dubai to unload cargo destined there before  possibly returning to al-'Aqabah or offloading the Jordan-bound  cargo elsewhere the shipowners or consigners--as the case may be  subject to the terms and conditions of the bill of lading--to  tranship the goods to al-'Aqabah. [sentence as published]    Contacts launched by the Jordanian government led to the  agreement for an on-land inspection of the cargo and the Skyman  was recalled to the Red Sea, only to be turned away again as  happened on Monday.    The Skyman was the seventh ship to be intercepted and  subjected to costly delays this year compared with 20 vessels  during last year.    U.S. Navy spokesman deny that there is an escalation of  interceptions and tightening of inspection procedures despite  the high number of ships delayed or forced to offload cargo  elsewhere.    Jordan has lodged numerous protests to the U.N. Security  Council, which imposed and authorised the enforcement of the  sanctions, and the U.S., which is leading the monitoring of the  sanctions. The protests highlighted that the actual victim of  the overzealous enforcement of the sanctions was Jordan and that  the volume of Iraq-bound cargo passing through al-'Aqabah had  declined to less than 20 per cent of the pre-Gulf crisis level.    Shipping agents say that Iraq-bound goods passing through  Turkey and Iran are six times that coming to al-'Aqabah and  point out that Turkish bound and Iran-bound vessels are not  subjected to any inspections.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Podgorica, Yugoslavia, Feb 2 (TANJUG) -- Italian  Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta says that Italy has  acquiesced in Montenegro's request to intercede with the U.N.  Sanctions committee for stepping up the procedure for issuing  permits for aid deliveries to that Yugoslav Republic. In a  letter to his Montenegrin counterpart Miodrag Lekic, Andreatta  said Italy had upheld also Montenegro's request for permission  to export aluminium and use the proceeds for humanitarian  imports. Andreatta said that Italy was already investing  efforts for the reopening of the ferry line between Bari, Italy,  and Bar, Montenegro, being aware of its importance to Yugoslavia  (Serbia/Montenegro) and its communications with the rest of the  world.    Although humanitarian goods are supposed to be exempt from  sanctions clamped on Yugoslavia by the United Nations in May of  1992 for its alleged involvement in civil war in neighbouring  Bosnia-Herzegovina, the U.N. sanctions committee has often been  deliberately slow in issuing the necessary permits for the  import of even the most essential articles, which are in  extremely short supply because of the embargo, making life  difficult both for the Yugoslavs and the 700,000 refugees  accommodated in the country.</p>

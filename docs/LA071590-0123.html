			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: A COFFIN FOR DIMITRIOS BY ERIC AMBLER (CARROLL &amp; GRAF:  $3.95)  </P> <P> First published in 1937, Eric Ambler's "A Coffin for Dimitrios" served as the  model for the modern spy thriller reviewers call -- with more enthusiasm than  grammar -- "a page-turner" or "a good read." Mystery writer Charles Latimer  painstakingly reconstructs the career of the elusive master criminal, drug  dealer and paid assassin, Dimitrios Makropoulos; Ambler builds his story with  equal care, inexorably leading the reader to a startling climax in the  lower-class quarters of Paris. This taut evocation of Europe between the wars  reveals how much pop pulp fiction, from the novels of John le Carre to "Murder,  She Wrote," owes to Eric Ambler.  </P></p>

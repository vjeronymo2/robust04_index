			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHADOW OF A DOUBT  </P> <P> It is interesting that much is made of the Johnsons' class status. Would this  story have been done if Mr. Johnson had been a welder instead of a  "professional"? A Mexican-American immigrant gardener? The fact that the  Johnsons own a home with a view where they have lovely barbecues for their  friends only serves to call attention to what is true in many dysfunctional  families (and which seemed very important to Siegel): Appearance is everything.  Although I feel certain that Siegel knows that sexual abuse of children knows  no class or economic boundary, the maintenance of Mr. Johnson's innocence seems  to hinge largely on his professional status and his good income (and his own  businessman-style aggressiveness).  </P> <P> PATRICIA HUNT  </P> <P> El Segundo  </P></p>

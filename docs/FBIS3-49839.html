			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Today three-hour talks were held by representatives  of the Democratic Convention of Romania [CDR] and those of the  Democratic Party-National Salvation Front [PD-FSN]. The goal of  the talks, to which the press did not have access, was to find  consensus elements in the views of the opposition parties that  are prepared to assume responsibility for leading the country  out of its current situation.    A statement released for the press after the conclusion of  the talks says that in the opinion shared by the opposition  parties, they are able to come up with concrete suggestions  regarding both political and economic-social problems. Today's  talks prove that the opposition parties have the necessary  foresight, will, and competence to ensure the economic recovery,  social peace, political stability, and international credibility  of the country, the statement says.    Assessing that the current deadlock is the consequence of a  government based on political alliances that are harmful for the  country, as they allow for the access to power of certain  non-democratic, anti-reform, extremist, and xenophobic forces,  the current parliamentary opposition declares that it is ready  to assume the responsibility for ruling the country. To that  purpose the parliamentary majority has to be restructured and  therefore the opposition expresses its readiness to set up a  coalition government with the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of  Romania -- ruling party].    The responsibility now lies with those who hold the  principal  levers of the current political power. If the political  proposal made by the opposition is ignored, the solution to this  problem should be given by means of the direct vote of the  nation [early elections], the statement concludes.</p>

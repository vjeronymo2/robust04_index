			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Property: Shute first and worry later - Cadogan's Place SHUTE HOUSE near Shaftesbury, Dorset, is somewhere I could move at once. Mainly Georgian, it combines rural relaxation with urban sophistication and has an unusual sense of the garden coming right inside. Step outside and you see what a garden it is - one of the greatest of the 20th century in England. Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe designed it to be an integral part of the countryside. Thanks to having the river Nadder rise there, he achieved a rare harmony by creating a spectacular set of ponds, canals and streams. Everywhere, you hear the sound of running water. In the main water garden, designed like Moghul gardens in India, the small falls make different tones as the water runs through. The ponds reflect plantings that survive only if they delight the eye - the camellias are a joy. It is an architectural garden, using statues, earthenware jars and topiary in box and yew to reinforce a magical blend of man and nature. If I had Pounds 1.25m, I would call Savills (0722-320 422) right away. Halkin Gate House off Belgrave Square, London SW1, is totally urban and provides a chance to peep into the life of the super-rich. Two town cottages with a grand facade have become a splendid house of impressive workmanship. A new second floor holds a huge master bedroom suite, with the shower tucked into the angle of the roof, and the basement has been dug out to take a swimming pool large enough for doing proper lengths. De Groot Collis (071-235 8090) offers the house at over Pounds 6.5m for a lease ending on Christmas Day 2050. The Property Misdescriptions Act has now been in force for two weeks and already it has caused a fine stir among agents who are having to tone down their purple prose and be as quick to mention minuses - the disco next door or the motorway at the bottom of the garden - as they always have been with the pluses. False or misleading statements can lead to Pounds 5,000 fines. It is far too early to see how the act will work and what attitudes local trading standards officers will take. But it should inhibit rogue agents and help buyers by letting them know the snags before they make long journeys to inspect properties. Reputable firms have little to fear, provided they can show they have acted with due diligence. In the longer run, though, sales particulars may reduce to little more than a list of rooms and their sizes, and the make of the boiler. Owners should not throw away receipts for improvements, repairs or maintenance (including for leaseholders' service charges or rent for common gardens or tennis court) as the estate agents may ask to see them one day if you decide to sell. Easter marked the start of the season for visiting stately homes. A useful guide to what is open and when - covering houses anywhere from Bantry, Co. Cork, Ireland, via Spencer House, London SW1, to the Queen's at Sandringham, Norfolk - is the Historic House Directory 1993 (Pounds 7.95) prepared by Norman Hudson of the Historic Houses Association. Its information includes advice for couriers and coach drivers, which will help those organising groups: Sudeley Castle in Gloucestershire, for instance, lays on meal vouchers, a rest room and television for drivers. The directory also lists properties where you can stay as a paying guest, those that are now hotels, and houses that can manage corporate entertaining and other special events.</p>

			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / BAe deal may be saved by loan guarantees: Taiwan Treasury could underwrite Pounds 250m venture TAIWAN may guarantee loans as part of a package to save a Pounds 250m joint venture between British Aerospace and Taiwan Aerospace Corporation. Mr Yang Shih-chien, deputy minister of economic affairs, said yesterday that he did not rule out the Treasury making loan guarantees if the two sides failed to agree on financing the deal. He was speaking after 16 hours of talks in Taipei between Taiwanese officials and Mr John Cahill, BAe's chairman, failed to settle disagreements on financing and technology transfer. Mr Cahill and his team of four senior executives will continue their attempt to rescue the deal this morning. Both sides remained optimistic that a deal would be concluded even if talks spilled into a third day. The Avro joint venture is central to Mr Cahill's strategy to improve BAe profitability. The RJ series of regional aircraft, which would be built partly in Taiwan under the joint venture, loses money for the company. BAe said proposals it had received from Mr Liang Kuo-shu, chairman of the Chiao Tung Bank, the Taiwanese state-owned bank, 'were positive'. The Chiao Tung Bank leads a banking consortium that is due to provide all the initial working capital for Avro. Some members of the consortium want stronger guarantees that technology, design and manufacturing skills will be transferred to Taiwan. The original joint venture contract signed in January 'was rather loose,' Mr Yang, who has been closely associated with the proposal, said yesterday. The banks also want assurances over the status of assets BAe is putting into the joint venture company - land, plant and machinery in the UK - as collateral. Taiwanese law prevents a bank from making unsecured loans to a company in which it has more than a 3 per cent stake. This threshold is breached by the Chiao Tung Bank, which owns significantly more than this. Financial specialists with the Chiao Tung Bank were at the centre of the talks in Taipei which lasted until almost midnight. In a further step to reassure the banks yesterday, the government drafted an official letter stating its commitment to Avro, after the banks indicated the government's earlier verbal support was insufficient.

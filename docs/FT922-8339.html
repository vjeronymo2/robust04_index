			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Profit-taking triggers market slide AN INEVITABLE bout of profit-taking emerged yesterday, sending London share prices lower after a prolonged bull run that has seen the Footsie moving to record levels for four consecutive trading sessions. Yesterday's fall was triggered by more evidence that the recent run of big gains in the equity market would see the emergence of some hefty lines of stock for sale, coupled with concern that the market had run too far,too fast. There was also the worry, according to traders, that the Wall Street market, which has been attaining record highs over recent weeks, may be due for a sizeable correction. The market was in good form at the outset, edging higher in response to the latest record achieved by Wall Street. The Footsie opened five points stronger at 2,742.8, marginally short of the all-time best, but suddenly began to slide. The decline was caused by an uninspiring statement issued by Marks and Spencer along with its preliminary figures. Although not causing any major damage to the M and S share price, the news quickly caused a ripple of unease around the market, with the Footsie on the slide and showing a fall of almost 19 points by mid-morning. Thereafter, the market managed to hold its lower levels, before coming under renewed pressure towards the close of business when Wall Street began to lose ground. The latest UK economic data on producer prices failed to generate any enthusiasm in the gilts market, although sterling improved strongly against the US dollar over the session. A couple of medium-sized programme trades, one said to have been carried out overnight and the other executed in midsession, also impacted on the market. By the close, the Footsie had struggled back to end the session 15.4 off at 2,722.4. Yesterday's turnover in the equity market, 592.1m shares, was well short of recent levels, but was regarded as a good performance from a market ripe for profit-taking after the recent surge of buying interest. Stock overhangs from the market's most recent bought deals were said to have been partly responsible for the reluctance of potential buyers to chase prices higher yesterday. ICI, after the Goldman Sachs bought deal, and Pilkington, in the wake of BZW's purchase of the BTR stake, were two examples of this, according to specialists. There were suggestions that a number of large lines of stock - notably Racal Electronics and Bass - had been offered around the market, causing more indigestion. An agency cross of 3m Britannic Assurance at 895p a share was later confirmed as representing the sale of the shares by Britannic's own pension fund. General Accident kicked off the composite insurance sector's first-quarter results season with better than expected figures. The utilities sector was among the market's busiest areas, with Kleinwort Benson Securities said to have played a big role in the day's activity. This mainly involved unravelling of the Electricity Package and reinvestment in specific electricity stocks.</p>

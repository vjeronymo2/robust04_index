			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: The logic of the contrarian FT-SE Index: 2,534.3 (-12.8) The world seems to have taken on a particularly bearish tone just lately. A few days ago, the head of one of the UK's biggest companies suggested privately that economic recovery, in the sense of a return to the good days of the 1980s, was not going to happen at all. Yesterday the chief central bankers of both Japan and Germany said that they saw no reason to ease interest rates. James Capel, normally one of the chirpier London brokers, has just published a circular dwelling on the dire hypothesis that the next big Tokyo earthquake is overdue. It is enough to make the contrarian buy anything on sight. The first step might be to look at what has fallen furthest in the past year. In the UK market, this produces the usual suspects: contracting, property, composite insurers and metal-bashers: or among FT-SE stocks, Tarmac, British Aerospace, Lonrho, Royal Insurance and British Steel. Some of the stocks might be worth considering for their takeover potential. When it comes to the sectors, there is a broader question: what are the economic conditions which would make them cheap? The obvious answer is the traditional one; a fall in real interest rates, produced by the usual combination of lower nominal rates and rising inflation. This is just the solution the German and Japanese central bankers were explicitly rejecting yesterday. In the UK's case, it would also involve a strong inflationary rise in asset prices - houses especially - and of course devaluation. There is a theoretical alternative, consisting of real productivity-led growth in output. But that would take time, and would also involve the UK outpacing its international competitors. It all comes back to a familiar conclusion: the only quick fix for the UK economy is to leave the ERM, and damn the consequences.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 2 May (PL) -- Cuba is ready to make  concessions that are indispensable to adapting its economy to  the new international reality without renouncing socialist  principles, President Fidel Castro said today upon closing the  special session of the parliament.    The president stressed that the measures proposed by the  National Assembly of the People's Government to cleanse the  country's economy defend the spirit of socialism without  disregarding the reality of a world that is in the hands of  multinationals.    Appealing to the people's understanding on the need to adopt  these measures promptly, the president insisted on the  advantages of this action over the neoliberal recipes which, he  asserted, have caused crises in various countries, particularly  in the social area.    Fidel Castro called for a broad dissemination of all topics  discussed at the parliament, in search of the broadest popular  support. In this regard, he highlighted the earlier speech by  Assembly President Ricardo Alarcon, who recalled what is the  fate proposed for the island from Miami. He added that  well-to-do and large landowners, whose properties were  expropriated by the 1959 revolution, want to return from Miami  to claim their former properties and privileges.    The Cuban president noted the need to act perfectly and  quickly, while guaranteeing not only the recovery of excess  circulating currency but also a progressive improvement of the  economic situation to insure that disequilibrium is not  reproduced.    Fidel Castro affirmed the measures will be gradual but "will  not be left unimplemented." He termed the parliament's final  resolution "broad and flexible," which will permit the  government to act to correct disequilibrium and its causes.    According to official figures from this Assembly, Cuba is  facing a budget deficit of 4.2 billion pesos (equal to dollars  at the official Cuban exchange rate) and an excess of  circulating currency estimated at 11.636 billion pesos. These  indicators are considered one of the main obstacles on the path  to economic recovery.</p>

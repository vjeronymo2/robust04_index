			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DETROIT'S PROBLEMS IMPERIL MAYOR YOUNG'S LONG REIGN  </P> <P> For 15 years, Detroit Mayor Coleman A. Young has been the unrivaled political  master of the nation's sixth-largest city -- and one of the most powerful black  politicians anywhere in America.  </P> <P> Young has held a virtual monopoly on Detroit politics since he was first  elected in 1974, and his office has become a mandatory stop for virtually any  Democrat seeking national office.  </P> <P> But as he readies his bid this year for an unprecedented fifth term, the  70-year-old Young's future is far from secure.  </P> <P> Opinion polls find voters increasingly frustrated and angry by Young's failure  to turn around Detroit's broken economy or to curb the city's epidemic of  drug-related crime. At the same time, Young has suffered an embarrassing string  of political defeats over the past year, and a growing list of powerful black  leaders -- including some erstwhile Young allies -- are preparing to take him  on in next September's nonpartisan primary election.  </P> <P> "I've become less and less inclined over the last few years to continue to  support Young. . . . It's time to make a change," says Erma Henderson, the  president of the Detroit City Council and the city's top vote-getter, who  recently announced she will challenge Young.  </P> <P> "I count myself as a friend of Coleman's, but there is an extent to which the  city could benefit from an infusion of new energy," adds Kenneth Cockrel, an  influential black attorney and former City Council member. Cockrel, who says he  is seriously considering running against Young this year, insists: "There is a  feeling abroad that new blood would give the city a shot in the arm."  </P> <P> Few observers, however, expect Young, the only mayor in Detroit history to  serve more than two terms, to go quietly. With a reported $4 million in his  campaign war chest and a ready grass-roots organization, Young still commands a  formidable political base and remains the man to beat in the race.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Still Seen as Pioneer  </P> <P> As the city's first black mayor, he is still seen as a pioneering leader by  many in Detroit's black community, which now accounts for two-thirds of the  city's population. And, as a result, even black challengers to Young in the  past have been branded tools of white interests by some of Young's black  supporters in this race-conscious city.  </P> <P> "Young is a living legend among black voters," observes Jack Casey, a Detroit  public relations executive and political analyst. "He never did get much  support in the white community, but that vote is getting smaller and smaller in  the city anyway.  </P> <P> "There is an undercurrent that says Young should step aside, and that shows an  erosion in his support," Casey adds. "But I think it would take a vote of  no-confidence by many, many black voters to end his tenure, and I don't see  that happening."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Recent Setbacks  </P> <P> Yet even Young supporters acknowledge that the mayor's power has been  threatened by a series of recent setbacks. Most notably, Young's controversial  proposal to bring casino gambling to the city as a way to revive Detroit's  devastated economy was soundly defeated in a 1988 referendum. The proposal led  to a split between Young and a number of leading Baptist ministers, who are  extremely influential in the city's black community.  </P> <P> "There is a lot of unrest in the political arena in this city," observes the  Rev. James Holley, a popular black minister who fought Young on the casino  issue. "There are a lot of unhappy people."  </P> <P> Young was also hurt by his decision to endorse Massachusetts Gov. Michael S.  Dukakis instead of the Rev. Jesse Jackson in the state's Democratic  presidential caucuses last March. Jackson swept Detroit and won the caucuses;  even Young's own political operatives defected to Jackson. (Yet, while Jackson  has already endorsed acting Mayor Eugene Sawyer in this year's Chicago mayoral  race, Jackson so far has not taken a stand for or against Young in the Detroit  race.)  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in last November's election, Young suffered another blow when a  grass-roots slate of reformist candidates for the Detroit Board of Education  swept out four Young-backed incumbents. Voters last year also rejected a  Young-supported bond to finance further expansion of the city's downtown civic  center. Young's critics charge he has focused too much of the city's resources  on downtown development at a time when many of Detroit's neighborhoods have  turned into urban wastelands.  </P> <P> "Young has gone for glitzy and expensive projects downtown while the  neighborhoods are in a shambles," complains Mel Ravitz, a City Council member  who expects to support one of Young's challengers.  </P> <P> Young suffered still more political and personal embarrassment in recent days  after an ex-city staffer filed a paternity suit against him. In a case that has  become the talk of Detroit, Annivory Calvert, who has just moved to California  to become director of public works for the city of Fontana, claims she had a  relationship with Young from 1980 to 1987 and that Young fathered her  6-year-old son.  </P> <P> Young has refused to comment on the paternity suit, but the case has further  emboldened Young's opponents to call for him to finally retire.  </P> <P> "The time for Coleman to step aside was a few years back," adds City Clerk  James Bradley, a longtime Young foe.  </P> <P> In fact, a January poll by the Detroit News found that more than half of the  city's voters believe Young should not seek reelection. At the same time, a  poll in the Detroit Free Press found a virtual dead heat in a potential race  between Young and Tom Barrow, a young black businessman who is expected to run  against Young.  </P> <P> Yet aides say Young now relishes the prospect of a real race for a change --  and Young also makes it quite clear that he expects to win.  </P> <P> When asked about the newspaper polls that suggest a close election, Young  scolds reporters that it is far too early to predict the outcome.  </P></p>

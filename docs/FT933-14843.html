			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / No nukes is good nukes David Gergen and the other news manipulators did a fine job for their political masters at the meeting of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations in Tokyo last week. They got great headlines for the 'agreement' on a Gatt deal, for the group's hypocritical words on Bosnia, for the Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) aid package for Russia. Considering that the meeting had gathered amid a general consensus that the G7 was a busted flush, and the seven leaders the most discredited bunch in recent history, this was quite an achievement for the spin merchants. A by-product of this was that the news managers were able to downplay one of the most serious items on the G7 agenda: the prospect that the world is on the threshold of an ominous, and quite possibly dangerous, proliferation of nuclear weapons. The issue is mentioned in the final communique, but in such deadpan terms that it remained safely on the inside pages. The first and most immediate cause of anxiety is Ukraine, which after long debate now seems determined to hang on to at least some of the 176 strategic nuclear missiles which were part of the Soviet arsenal and happened to be based on Ukrainian territory. This could jeopardise the radical US-Russian nuclear arms reductions treaties signed only six months ago; but it could also give new and dangerous encouragement to other countries to acquire nuclear weapons. Then there is North Korea, which is probably engaged on building up its own nuclear weapons capability, in defiance of its commitment not to do so under the multilateral nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). This is a particularly disturbing break-out by a hard-line, communist and militaristic country. Last week in Tokyo, Japan made it clear that it would regard a nuclear-armed North Korea as a serious threat to its national security. Japan could probably build nuclear weapons and their delivery systems in very short order, if it decided to go down that road. So if North Korea becomes a nuclear weapons state, we should assume that Japan will, too. Whether anything can be done to stop North Korea is uncertain. The Americans have been trying diplomatic arm-twisting in bilateral talks, apparently with only modest success: Washington is now talking of international sanctions. Ukraine has not stated unambiguously its intention to become a nuclear weapons state; but that seems the direction it is heading. President Leonid Kravchuk said last week that the nuclear missiles should be declared 'national property' (whatever that means) - until they are destroyed. Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma went further, and said that Ukraine should formally proclaim itself a nuclear weapons state - until the weapons are removed and destroyed. In the meantime, US intelligence suspects that the Ukrainians are working on the electronic codes which control the missiles, and may be able to crack them in the not-too-distant future. Ukraine's fundamental objectives remain ambiguous, because the political class is divided. Sometimes it seems they are just using the missiles as bargaining counters, to get more financial aid from the west; such an objective can only have been reinforced by the Tokyo meeting, which offered Dollars 3bn to Russia but nothing to Ukraine. But sometimes it seems they regard the missiles as a security guarantee against possible Russian aggression; and would only give them up in exchange for a security guarantee from the west. If that is the bottom line, Ukraine will keep the missiles, because the west will not give such a guarantee. In the meantime, Ukrainian foot-dragging is blocking the implementation of the second Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (Start-II) agreed only six months ago by George Bush and Boris Yeltsin. That agreement should reduce the long-range nuclear arsenals of Russia and the US by about two-thirds, from some 11,000-12,000 warheads each to about 3,500 by early next century. But this treaty cannot go into effect, because Ukraine has not ratified the previous Start-I treaty of 1991 on which Start-II is built. But if nuclear proliferation by Ukraine is a by-product of the disintegration of the Soviet Union, it may be part of a more general pattern. Kazakhstan is another republic with some former Soviet weapons; but whereas Kazakhstan has ratified Start-I, it has not signed the NPT as a non-nuclear weapons state. Iraq's incentive to go nuclear has been intensified by the end of the cold war, since it can no longer rely on Soviet military support against the west. Even North Korea may see the end of the cold war as a reason to build up its national 'security'. As a result, the official nuclear powers are urgently trying to rebuild the political credibility of the non-proliferation regime. President Bill Clinton has extended the US moratorium on nuclear testing for another 15 months, and Russia and France have both given their support to a comprehensive test ban. The UK government does not share their enthusiasm, but has enough sense not to object. The probable collapse of the non-proliferation dyke will have far-reaching consequences. If nuclear weapons are no longer restricted to the very few, those who used to claim to be the only legitimate members of the nuclear club will need new justifications for their political privileges, starting with permanent membership of the UN Security Council. Sooner or later, Germany and Japan must get permanent seats, and it would be better if they did so without acquiring nuclear weapons. Britain and France should make a virtue of necessity, and urge their admission.</p>

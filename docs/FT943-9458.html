			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / People: George Bradt joins Coca-Cola Coca-Cola Great Britain and Ireland has appointed a new consumer marketing director, George Bradt (left), currently director of marketing and sales with Disney Development Company in the US. Bradt, 36, succeeds Steve Jones, who is moving to Coca-Cola Japan in Tokyo. Bradt is taking on responsibility for all marketing in the UK and Ireland for Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, and other brands such as Fanta, Lilt and Sprite, at a time of increasing competition in the market. The launch of its own-label Classic Cola by the UK's biggest food retailer J. Sainsbury in a blaze of media publicity in April prompted Coca-Cola to step up its already high-profile marketing campaigns. Bradt says a priority will be to try to increase the size of the total UK market for soft drinks. Coca-Cola, he says, needs to find 'new ways to meet consumer needs in a market which still has a lower per capita consumption of soft drinks than countries such as Germany and the USA'. This is Bradt's first post in the UK, but before joining Disney he worked for companies such as Pollio Dairy Products, part of Kraft, Procter &amp; Gamble, and Lever Brothers.</p>

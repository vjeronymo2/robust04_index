			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Intifadah Enters the Arms Phase"] </F>   [Text] Tension has been mounting in the occupied Arab  territories since the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron.  After the suicide operation carried out by one of the fedayeen  of the Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas in 'Afula, in which  eight Israelis were killed and at least 50 wounded, there have  been other operations in the cities of the West Bank and the  Gaza Strip throughout the past two days, especially the  operation carried out in Ashdod by an Islamic Jihad Movement  fighter in which one Israeli was killed and four others were  wounded.    This escalation occurs as the current Palestinian-Israeli  negotiations on the implementation of the Oslo agreement stumble  because of Israel's refusal to set a date for the start of the  withdrawal of its forces from the Gaza Strip and the Jericho  area, and Israel's timewasting in discussion of minor details.  Just as the Hebron massacre underlined the importance of  Palestinian security and the difficulty of coexistence between  the Palestinians and the armed settlers, the latest fedayeen  operations against Israelis inside the so-called green line and  in the Gaza Strip confirm that the Hebrew state will never have  security and stability so long as it maintains its current  policy of humiliating the Arab negotiators and trying to  blackmail them and to have both peace and land.    The United States and its current administration is  responsible for the deteriorating situation in the occupied  territories because it has, for the past seven months, ignored  the PLO's appeals for intervention to break the negotiation  deadlock.    President Clinton's administration has allowed Israel to  persist in its conceit and arrogance in dealing with the  Palestinians. When the Hebron massacre occurred, it was  reluctant to condemn Israel and refused to vote in favor of the  draft resolution calling for the disarmament of the settlers and  the provision of international protection for the people of the  West Bank and the Gaza Strip. It is regrettable that the U.S.  Administration has been putting intense pressure on the PLO over  the past two days to make it condemn the 'Afula suicide  operation. It did not exert the same pressure on Israel after  the Jabalya massacre in which eight people were unjustifiably  killed by Israeli special units. American officials, in making  such demands -- which to them are ordinary demands -- on the  PLO, fail to understand their dangers and their negative,  perhaps even catastrophic, effects, and that is because they do  not understand the Arab and, particularly, the Palestinian  mentality. Any fedayeen operation against Israelis is received  with applause and satisfaction in the occupied territories, and  anyone who carries it out is a hero and a martyr who is buried  in the graveyard of the martyrs and the immortals.    Nobody can blame them for that conviction, for they have  suffered the fire of daily Israeli repression and they face  Israeli bullets with their chests. Any condemnation of the  fedayeen operations is seen as a perpetuation of the occupation  and as a blessing on its settlements and aggressive policies.  That is why the PLO is very reluctant to give in to U.S.  demands in this connection.    The officials responsible for U.S. policy in the Arab region  -- and some of them are Jews -- aim to isolate the PLO from its  people and they aim to foment internal sedition in the occupied  territories by calling on the PLO to condemn a legitimate act  such as is carried out by all peoples of the world in the march  toward independence and liberation. Resistance remains a  legitimate and necessary element so long as there is occupation,  and even more so when it is a repressive, colonialist,  expansionist occupation like the current Israeli occupation of  Palestinian.    What is happening in the occupied territory is a renewal of  the intifadah and a shift from the war of knives to the war of  arms and explosives, which is, without doubt, the bloodiest and  most dangerous war. Israel and the United States are to blame  for this shift and its consequences because they aborted the  peace process in the first real test on 13 December when Israel  was supposed to begin withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and the  Jericho area, and in doing so they gave extremism a golden  opportunity to overtake moderation and to increase its popular  following in the occupied territories. That is what Israel  wanted and what it had planned and continues to plan for because  it does not want to give up the territory nor to commit itself  to any peaceful settlement.</p>

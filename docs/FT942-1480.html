			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Day of judgment for the CDU: Judy Dempsey reports on an east German test for Chancellor Kohl Mr Theodor Luhr, a senior official at Saxony-Anhalt's economics ministry, was sitting in a sparsely decorated small office in the government complex on the outskirts of Magdeburg, the state capital. 'What I worry about most is that when people vote in the elections, they will forget what it was like before 1989,' he said. Like many other officials, he has no idea if the governing Christian Democrats (CDU)/Free Democrats (FDP) coalition will be returned to power on Sunday when the first of the eastern states goes to the elections. During the last state elections in Saxony-Anhalt in October 1990, the CDU received 39 per cent of the vote and the FDP 13.5 per cent. The Social Democrats (SPD) polled 26 per cent. In the local elections earlier this month, seen as the most reliable barometer, the CDU's support slipped to 31.1 per cent, the SPD's rose to 29.7, the FDP fell to 7.9 per cent, and the reformed communists, the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), rose to 18.2 per cent. Before German unification, the Stasi, or state security police, had occupied the grey, dull government buildings. One could hardly see out of the windows, or dared to open them. The air was stinking - thick and poisoned from pollution emanating from the chemical works, the mainstay of the Saxony-Anhalt economy. Four years later, the stench has gone; the air is clear. 'People forget those smells,' said Mr Luhr. 'I also remember when I moved into these offices in late 1990, we only had three senior people to dismantle this huge centralised economy. Our economic policy was based on one principle. We had to break the monolithic structure through privatisation, diversification, and investments,' he added. Since then, more than DM2.5bn (Pounds 1bn) has been spent on upgrading the streets and roads. Another DM4bn has been spent on modernising the archaic telephone system. An additional DM12bn has been poured into restructuring the chemical industry. But the CDU has found it difficult to get its economic message across. 'People don't think about the long-term impact of the investments. They think about jobs and the high level of unemployment. 'This is the price we have had to pay to dismantle this wasteful and inefficient economic structure,' said Mr Luhr. The SPD has latched on to unemployment in the belief that the party will woo away voters from the CDU - and the PDS. Excluding those on job creation schemes and short-time work, Saxony-Anhalt's unemployment rate is more than 17 per cent, higher than the average in the other eastern states which is now 15.5 per cent. But as Mr Luhr argues, the unemployment rate is one of the highest because the state's manufacturing and chemical industry was one of the most inefficient and overmanned. But the SPD's ability to exploit the unemployment issue is handicapped by its weak party organisation, and the increasing popularity of the PDS, both factors which could be to the CDU's advantage. Unlike the CDU, FDP and PDS, the SPD in eastern Germany had no communist-sanctioned 'bloc party' before unification. 'We had to start completely from scratch,' said Ms Sabine Kaspereit, the SPD mayor of the small town of Wengelsdorf, who is running for the Bundestag next October. 'We only have about 6,000 SPD members, whereas the PDS inherited all the Communist party organisations and structures. 'The other parties could rely on a local network as well. We started from zero.' The other problem facing the SPD is its image. 'We told Mr Scharping he was colourless and that he had to have strong policies with which the easterners could identify, otherwise the PDS would drain votes away from us,' said Ms Edith Braun, the SPD mayor from Stendal. Many SPD officials admit that the worthy and respected Mr Reinhard Hoppner, the party's leading candidate in Sunday's election, is no match for the charismatic Mr Gregor Gysi, the PDS's most prominent politician. Yet Mr Christoph Bergner, the CDU prime minister, cannot rely on a split vote in the left for the coalition to be returned to power. Although the CDU is gaining in popularity in Saxony-Anhalt, the party has to do far better than the recent local election results because the FDP is doing so badly. Part of the reason is the spate of corruption scandals in the government. Another reason is that the FDP relied on the personality of Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the former foreign minister who was born in Halle, the state's second largest city, to attract support. But now, similar to the SPD, Mr Klaus Kinkel, the FDP's leader and foreign minister, is considered dull and ineffectual. 'We are clinging onto power. The outcome might be a grand coalition,' said Mr Helmut Starauschek of the economic ministry. Sunday's outcome will show whether Chancellor Helmut Kohl's policies in eastern Germany will be vindicated, or Mr Rudolf Scharping, head of the SPD, can make the vital breakthrough needed to dislodge the CDU, he says.</p>

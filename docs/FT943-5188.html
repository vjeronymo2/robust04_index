			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Survey of Mobile Communications (14): Tide of deregulation sweeps Europe - Mark Newman sees state-owned operators give way to competition Continental Europe was slow to embrace competition in mobile communications networks and services. Only three countries - the UK, France and Sweden - had more than one cellular telephone operator before the launch of GSM digital cellular networks in 1992. But within the last two years most countries have licensed at least one competitor to the state-owned telephone operator. Even Europe's most reluctant deregulators - Spain, Belgium and Ireland - are being swept along in a tide of deregulation and industry restructuring. The transition to competitive markets is having major implications for the telecommunications services sector as a whole. It has acted as the catalyst for change at lumbering, inward-facing state-owned telephone operators whose own mobile communications businesses had, for several years, operated in a monopoly environment. Deutsche Telekom has spun off its mobile communications division as a wholly-owned autonomous subsidiary in a bid to inject private sector discipline and commercial practices. In Belgium, Belgacom has sold a 25 per cent stake in its mobile division to AirTouch Communications, the Pacific Telesis subsidiary. Telefonica of Spain is also considering the recruitment of a foreign partner, while Stet in Italy is being advised by its partners to float its mobile communications subsidiary. The introduction of competition has given expansionist-minded US telephone companies the opportunity to gain a foothold in Europe. AirTouch, the company spun-off from Pacific Telesis, is the most successful US telecommunications services company in Europe. It has stakes in cellular telephone networks in five European countries: Belgium, Germany, Italy, Portugal and Spain. Two other Baby Bells, BellSouth and US West, have also taken positions in Europe. BellSouth is the dominant force in mobile data with stakes in operators in the UK, France and the Netherlands. It is also a shareholder in cellular operators in Denmark, France and Germany. US West owns 50 per cent of Mercury One-2-One, the UK's third cellular operator. Vodafone Group, the UK cellular telephone operator, is emerging as the dominant force in cellular communications in Europe alongside AirTouch. It has stakes in cellular operators in six European countries other than the UK  -Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Malta and Sweden. Vodafone is relying on its overseas interests to boost its profits in the second half of the 1990s when competition in the UK will inevitably slow profits growth. Vodafone's overseas cellular interests, which also include stakes in cellular operators in Australia, Hong Kong and South Africa, are valued at around Pounds 1.5bn. In most cases, companies such as Vodafone and AirTouch have taken only minority stakes in cellular operators. Licences are awarded on the basis of 'beauty contests' and national licensing bodies tend to favour bidders with strong local interests. The largest single shareholder in a bidding consortium is usually a local company. For example, German industrial group Mannesmann has a 51 per cent stake in Mannesmann Mobilfunk, and in Italy, Olivetti is a 36 per cent shareholder in Omnitel Pronto Italia, the group which won Italy's second cellular telephone network licence earlier this year. For companies like Olivetti and Mannesmann with little or no tradition of operating in the telecommunications sector, the award of licences has offered them the possibility of expanding into a profitable new sector and reducing their reliance on core businesses. The European Commission firmly endorses the transition to competitive markets. Its green paper on mobile communications published in May says member states should license at least two GSM digital cellular operators, and one personal communications network operator. But the Commission has not been instrumental in the deregulation of the mobile communications sector. By the time its green paper was published in May this year - 2 1/2 years later than originally planned - most governments had already decided in favour of licensing at least one competitor to the state-owned operator. 'The Commission is confirming trends that have already been established,' says Mr George Metaxas, a legal expert at the Brussels office of Stanbrook and Hooper. 'This market has been driven in a legal sense by itself. What Brussels has done is not exactly an 11th-hour intervention, but they have certainly left it until the ninth or 10th hour.' In other respects, however, the Commission is making a bid to lay down its own agenda, according to Mr Metaxas. 'There are now new issues emerging such as roaming and restrictions to service providers.' Roaming is the ability to to use your telephone on a network in another country. With the new GSM system it is possible to make and receive calls across the whole of western Europe. But cross-border roaming has aroused controversy because it makes it possible for someone to take out a subscription in one country, but use the telephone primarily on a network in another country. Telefon und Funk, a German cellular telephone dealer, started selling subscriptions last year to a Danish GSM network. Telefon und Funk customers could make calls on both German GSM networks but would be billed by the Danish operator. The German operators complained and the dealer was forced to abandon the sale of subscriptions to the Danish network. But the dealer, backed by the Commission, is now having its case heard at the European Court of Justice. Another Brussels proposal which is opposed by a number of cellular operators is that they should be required to sell their services via wholesalers or service providers. Service providers would retain a share of around 20 to 30 per cent of subscriber revenues, and would be responsible for billing and customer management. The concept of service provision is central to the Commission's green paper on mobile communications published in May. Another important recommendation  -one which the cellular operators are firmly behind - is that they should be allowed to build their own long-distance networks, or use third-party networks, rather than hand calls over to the state-owned operators. A number of cellular operators believe that the charges levied by the state-owned operators for handling calls are too high, and are preventing them from lowering the price of their cellular services. After a slow start, continental Europe is now warming to the potential of mobile communications and the benefits of competitive markets. The total number of cellular subscribers in Europe is growing by 60 per cent a year compared to only 30 per cent in the period 1990 to 1992. This coincides with the impact of competition. In 1990 there were 22 cellular operators in 19 countries offering 22 different services. Today, 33 operators offer 87 different services.</p>

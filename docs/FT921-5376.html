			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Public-sector tendering criticised THE GOVERNMENT'S tender-ing procedures for information-technology contracts result in unnecessarily high costs for both sides, a director at a leading computer services group warned yesterday. Mr David Millard, public sector group accounts director of Hoskyns Group, said the tendering mechanism involved much longer sales lead times than in the private sector and an unnecessarily high number of contractors. This could result in reduced competition as contractors were bankrupted or forced to withdraw because of the costs involved. Even after efforts had been made to streamline the process, procurement for an entire IT package from hardware to training had taken Hoskyns 56 weeks to win. The IT industry has become more involved in the public sector, at both national and local levels, since the government white paper on competing for quality. At the same time, IT manufacturers have looked increasingly to the public sector for business, as recession has reduced business in the private sector. Mr Millard said the public sector was forced to go through 'a tortuous formalised process' of tendering to meet public accountability requirements. A pre-qualification phase to reduce the number of bidders would help to simplify the process and reduce costs without limiting competition.</p>

			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: GKN Following last week's announcement of an imminent order from Kuwait comes this week's announcement of the imminent signing of a contract on an order from Kuwait. GKN seems to be learning quickly the excellent defence trick of unveiling the same deal several times. And in traditional defence style the size and value of the order are state secrets and may remain so even when contracts are finally signed. Still, it is possible to discern something through the fog. The Kuwaiti order for Warriors will dovetail nicely with the ending of the production run for the British Army in 1994. Given that plant and development costs will have been written down margins on the Kuwaiti order should be good, and there may well be an additional order for Piranha wheeled vehicles later. All of which suggests that while GKN's current rating looks demanding, those prepared to look out to 1995 can see solid value.</p>

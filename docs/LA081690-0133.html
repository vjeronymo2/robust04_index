			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> COUNCIL ALLOWS RENOVATION TO CONTINUE AT HISTORIC CHURCH  </P> <P> The Glendale City Council agreed Tuesday to allow earthquake reinforcement work  and other renovation to continue at a historic church but withheld final  approval on a controversial wall that was erected around the church.  </P> <P> The council ordered the directors of St. Mary's Armenian Apostolic Church, 500  S. Central Ave., to work with the city's Historic Preservation Commission on a  plan to modify or remove portions of the perimeter walls that were erected  without review by the commission.  </P> <P> Some city officials have complained that the wall's design is not compatible  with the historic site.  </P> <P> Church leaders told the council Tuesday that the wall was built after city  staff members told them that no special permit was required.  </P> <P> The building was constructed in 1926 as the First Church of Christ, Scientist  using a Roman-Classical design. In 1977, city officials designated it as a  historic landmark. Such sites cannot be altered without a review by the  Historic Preservation Commission and the City Council.  </P> <P> City officials acknowledged that a building permit was issued by mistake  earlier this year to allow seismic reinforcement of the church building.  Renovation was halted after the error was discovered.  </P> <P> Under the agreement reached with the council, church leaders must replace  certain signs, install a bronze historic plaque and preserve 10 windows that  were to be filled in as part of the reinforcement work.  </P></p>

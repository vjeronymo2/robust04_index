			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> CUBA ATTRACTS 13% MORE TOURISTS  </P> <P> About 225,000 foreign tourists visited Cuba last year, a 13% rise over 1987,  according to National Tourist Board figures published today.  </P> <P> They included 31,000 visitors from socialist countries.  </P> <P> That share has remained stable over the last few years, and the government has  launched an ambitious development plan to attract more hard-currency tourists  with the aim of luring 600,000 visitors from the Western world by 1991.  </P> <P> The travel board said earnings increased 20% over 1987. It gave no exact  figures, but that increase would mean that hard-currency income from tourism  topped $120 million.  </P> <P> The official target is to have this revenue grow tenfold by the year 2000,  which would then make tourism the island's top hard-currency earner.  </P></p>

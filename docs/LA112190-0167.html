			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: A FRIEND SPEAKS OUT FOR MARLO THOMAS, PHIL DONAHUE  </P> <P> IT BEHOOVES us to be at least a little skeptical of the gossip printed for  which the purveyors have been paid vast tabloid sums of money or given large  book advances. I've been thinking about this while reading the sensational  hoopla over Marlo Thomas and Phil Donahue. It all started and was enhanced by  the revelations of a former employee who has now written a not-very-nice book  about the famous couple.  </P> <P> I know Phil and Marlo, and I can tell you I believe they are happily married  and well-adjusted after 10 years of wedlock. I don't believe any of this  garbage about their breaking up, and you shouldn't either.  </P> <P> Donahue has been especially adamant about not answering accusations made by the  disgruntled or money-hungry ex-worker, but the fallout has been wild. The  tabloids have had Marlo moving -- in the last three months -- to Israel, to  California and to Cleveland in order to separate from Phil. (She is now doing a  20th anniversary production of "The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man in the Moon  Marigolds" at the Cleveland Playhouse. Phil has joined her there in his  mother's hometown, where they will all celebrate Thanksgiving with his family.)  </P> <P> IT IS fascinating how very private this public couple have been. They do  frequently entertain for friends, both in New York and in their house in  Connecticut. But when I've been invited by the Donahues, I've always been asked  not to write about their private get-togethers. This can't exactly be called  "publicity seeking."  </P> <P> Now I want to speak out, along with their other outraged friends. Phil and  Marlo never received -- or sought -- any credit for the fact that when their  Connecticut houseman became ill with AIDS, they kept him in their home,  providing him with round-the-clock medical attention and stayed with him till  the end.  </P> <P> Likewise, Phil has never gone around bragging about his involvement with the  late AIDS child Ryan White and his family. Marlo has given millions of dollars  to the women's movement through her Free to Be You and Me foundation.  </P> <P> Here is a couple that has given generously to fight AIDS, to fight prejudice,  to fight illiteracy. Not a word has been written, that I know of, concerning  their work with child abuse foundations.  </P></p>

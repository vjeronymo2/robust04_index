			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Jail urged in French insider trade case THE prosecutor in the Pechiney insider trading trial yesterday demanded the maximum penalty of two years' prison for Mr Alain Boublil, a former aide to the late former French prime minister Mr Pierre Beregovoy, and for Mr Samir Traboulsi, a Lebanese financier, as well as a record FFr80m (Pounds 9.5m) fine for the latter. In all, the prosecutor, Mr Jean-Claude Marin, requested prison sentences for five of the nine defendants and fines for the others. Lawyers for the defendants, who have maintained their innocence, will begin their summing up today. The case, which Mr Marin claimed had sullied the image of Paris' financial market, centres on allegations that suspiciously large purchases of shares were made in Triangle, a US group, just before it sold its American Can subsidiary to Pechiney, the French state-controlled metals and packaging group in November 1989. The prosecutor claimed the trial disproved the widespread impression in France that those 'in the circles of power' could never be brought to justice. But he exonerated the late Mr Beregovoy, who committed suicide on May 1, shortly after he had given evidence to the investigating magistrate, from 'rumours that he was the real mastermind of all this'. As finance minister in 1988, Mr Beregovoy was only told of Pechinery's takeover plan after several of the alleged 'inside trades' had taken place, Mr Marin said. Referring to Mr Boublil's relationship with Mr Traboulsi, the prosecutor complained of the former's 'incredible confusion between service to the state and a useful friendship expensively maintained by stays in palaces and dream cruises on luxury yachts'. Mr Boublil admits his presence on Mr Traboulsi's yacht on which some Pechiney-Triangle negotiations took place, but nothing else.</p>

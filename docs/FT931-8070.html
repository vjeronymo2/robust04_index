			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Records: Potted jazz portraits PIANIST Stan Tracey OBE got his gong in 1986, but a major record deal has been longer in coming. His music, learnt with the top big bands of the 1950s and shaped by a long stint as Ronnie Scott's house pianist in the 1960s, is a ubiquitous part of the UK club scene. In Portraits Plus, a debut for the Blue Note label (0777 7 80696 2 1), Tracey takes his regular Octet on a tour of his favourite influences - Ellington, Monk, Rollins and Gil Evans. 'Clinkscales', which could almost be an onomatopoeic description of his technique, contains all the characteristic components of Tracey (Mrs Clinkscales was apparently Duke Ellington's piano teacher). Brisk chorus swapping between saxophones - Peter King's alto features here - trombone and trumpet is underpinned by Tracey's idiosyncratic accompaniment and son Clark's clattering drum fills. Tracey's exuberant arrangement and original writing fits the Blue Note label perfectly and thanks are due to the Arts Council whose funds helped put him there. I wonder if Tracey ever accompanied US altoist Jackie McLean during his time at Ronnie's? McLean ran with the likes of wayward young Miles Davis and Charlie Parker in the 1950s and lived to tell the tale. Rhythm of the Earth (Birdology 513916-2), a disc full of original compositions, shows his caustic lines and leadership qualities to be undimmed. After a wobbly start with an overlong title track, McLean's young septet (which features Roy Hargrove on trumpet and Steve Nelson on vibes - the others are students of McLean's) digs into characteristically giddy conversation between horns and rhthym section. The writing, shared by pianist Alan Jay Palmer, is tart and to the point. New writing and recording is traditionally outnumbered on the jazz shelves by re-issues from that golden period of 40 years ago and the firm establishment of the CD coupled with the onset of DCC and Minidisc will only maintain the trend. Art Blakey, the electrifying drum force behind the seething sound of the Messengers, left a huge recorded legacy perfect for compilation and re-issue. Blue Note's three disc The History of Art Blakey and The Jazz Messengers (CDP 7 97190 2) is a potted but nevertheless vital addition which traces the Messengers' make-up through the 40 years from 1947. No small group could swing like a Blakey band, the drummer's irresistable pulse and cross rhythms drove his distinguished soloists on (trumpeter Lee Morgan replaced Kenny Dorham, then came Freddie Hubbard and later Wynton Marsalis): the man's contagious enthusiasm fired new writers (Horace Silver, Bobby Timmons and Wayne Shorter, most notably). If it is easy to have a favourite Blakey period, it is less easy to define Lady Day's most appealing years. Verve's 10 disc box lays bare Billie Holiday's last years, 1945-59. It is widely held that the slender but strong voice of the 1930s was the singer's finest and that by the 1950s, only an emotional cripple could derive any pleasure from her ravaged tone. But this collection, first released as a limited edition with encyclopaedic notes and graphics and now available at Pounds 75 in a slightly less luxurious package (The Complete Billie Holiday on Verve; 517658-2), shows Billie in good and bad shape, in conversation and in the company of her favourite musicians. It is a revealing, musically rewarding snapshot of one of jazz music's most enduring characters. Those of you with a more limited budget, attention span and emotional resource could do worse than to try the late Dinah Washington's For those in love (Emarcy 514073-2), a 'special price' disc from a 1955 session which has the vocalist riding easily alongside a relaxed octet directed by Quincy Jones.</p>

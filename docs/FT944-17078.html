			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Survey of Business Travel (16): Services improve, but obstacles remain - Emerging destinations / China For the past two years China's economy has been growing faster than that of any other country. Business people are rushing to the country to cash in on the boom. The statistics say it all: gross domestic product has been growing at an annual rate of 8 per cent and reached double-digit figures in 1992. Regions in the south of the country have been expanding at an even greater rate. China's transition from rigid state control to a market-oriented system is bearing fruit for the indigenous population as well as foreigners. Business travel to and within the country has grown in tandem. and, fortunately, there have been improvements in the quality of thetravel services available. Serious infrastructural shortcomings still hinder business travel. Airline services are perhaps the biggest obstacle. Intrepid travellers who take domestic flights should not expect to enjoy anything like western standards. The country's national airline, CAAC, has been decentralised into over 25 regional airlines, practically one per province. Many, however, are very small operations with only a couple of aircraft. The largest is Air China, which has done most to upgrade to international standards. A joint venture company called Ameco Beijing, established between Lufthansa, the German flag-carrier, and Air China, undertakes aircraft maintenance and servicing. and has brought this particular airline to the vanguard of Chinese aviation. MD80 and B737 aircraft are utilised heavily for inter-city routes but there are also more passenger-friendly B737-300 and B767s in its fleet. On the ground, Beijing airport is less of a nightmare to fly into these days. In 1992 an extension to the terminal was opened, which eased congestion. By 1996 a new terminal will open. A six-lane highway downtown from Beijing airport has also helped cut the journey time of 45 minutes by about two-thirds. The 120km speed limit also helps. But one thing has not changed, and that is the inability to rent a car. Many taxis have meters but most drivers do not speak English, so it is wise to get directions written down. The shortage of good office and overnight accommodation in China's capital city is no longer so acute, however. For many years, visitors to Beijing could choose only from the Great Wall Sheraton, the Shangri-La Beijing (located a little too far out of town) and the Holiday Inn Lido, which is towards the airport. The Holiday Inn's adjoining apartment/office block was a Who's Who of the foreign business community. These stood out as beacons of western comfort. Over the last few years, however, there has been an explosion of new, western-managed hotels and the choice is almost limitless. Appalling traffic congestion in the city dictates that you must choose where to stay with care; otherwise, taxi fares become exorbitant and you will not makethe best use of your time in the city. All rooms have what you would expect in a European establishment: colour TV with satellite programmes and in-house movies, direct dial phones, air conditioning, minibars and PC and fax outlets. The SAS Royal has opened near the Holiday Inn, and both are adjacent to the China International exhibition centre. Go for the spacious Royal club rooms on its executive floor. Slightly closer to the centre is the Great Wall Sheraton - nearest to the embassy district - which has new neighbours in the shape of the Landmark, Hilton and Kempinski hotels. The latter is a mixed use complex with offices, apartments, endless restaurants and shops (including a Munich-style brewery) as well as useful services for expatriates such as a bakery and delicatessen. It also offers a shuttle bus to downtown. Closer in still is the Swissotel, part of the Hong Kong Macau Centre. Upgrade to junior suites for good-size bathrooms. To the east is the New World, another mini city-style operation with offices, shops and apartments. Directly south are two Shangri-La managed hotels, the three-star Traders and the five-star China World, together with over 20 restaurants, airline offices, exhibition space, two office towers, apartments and endless shops. Trade up to China World's Horizon floor if the budget allows. In the core of the city are two deluxe properties directly east of the Imperial Palace and Tiananmen Square: the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza and the Palace. Without doubt, the Palace is Beijing's finest, complete with a white marble staircase that would not be out of place in Hong Kong. Not surprisingly, it is managed by the Hong Kong based Peninsula group. Other hotels worth mentioning are the New Otani and the four-star Sara. Not everybody stays in Beijing, however. It is likely that you will be travelling to the south of the country because this region, more than anywhere else, has benefited from Deng Xiaoping's reforms. Deng's 'open door' policy, adopted in 1978, manifested itself in a list of Special Economic Zones set up for foreign investors. The Guangdong province and the Shenzen economic zone were the principal beneficiaries initially, followed by Pudong in 1980. Over the past 15 years, Guangzhou's economy has grown at an annual average rate of 13.9 per cent. During 1993 and 1994 it rocketed to 23 per cent. Travellers here can opt for one of the two rather large (over 1,000-room) hotels, the Garden of China, the much smaller Holiday Inn in the new commercial district or the Ramada Pearl, which is the closest to the Huangpu development zone. The city's Baiyun airport is just 20 minutes away. A visit to Shanghai, the country's financial centre, may be on your schedule. There are half a dozen good, western standard hotels to choose from. The best is probably the Portman Shangri-La but the Garden hotel (managed by Okura) is a close second. There is also the Shanghai Hilton, the Equatorial, JC Mandarin, Sheraton, New World and Westin Tai Ping Yang. Traffic is appalling in this major port; the airport is 14km away and queues for taxis are usually horrendous.</p>

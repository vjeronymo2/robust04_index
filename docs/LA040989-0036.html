			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CABBAGE PATCH TO 'URBAN VILLAGE';  </P> <P> $700-MILLION MACARTHUR PLACE ON FORMER SANTA ANA FARM TO INCLUDE OFFICE,  RETAIL, RESIDENTIAL USES  </P> <P> When developer Roger Torriero wanted to buy a 66-acre parcel in Santa Ana, he  opened negotiations with Roy Sakioka, patriarch of the family that owned much  of the land, with a fine piece of sashimi.  </P> <P> Then, as the story goes, Sakioka, a 90-year-old farmer who immigrated from  Japan in 1913, agreed to sell his 53 acres of cabbage and cucumber fields.  </P> <P> "Believe me, that didn't seal the deal," said George Sakioka, the patriarch's  grandson, referring to the sashimi. "We appreciated the offering of the fine  albacore . . . but the way we do business, a deal has to make economic sense."  </P> <P> The Sakiokas, who own more than $200 million worth of undeveloped land and hold  ground leases on high-rise office and housing projects, got $41 million in cash  and a 27% interest in their Santa Ana fields plus a 27% interest in an adjacent  13 acres.  </P> <P> The 66-acre site is now being developed into one of the largest mixed-use  projects in Orange County. Grading and site work will begin this week, with  completion estimated in 10 to 15 years at a cost of $700 million to $1 billion.  </P> <P> Known as MacArthur Place, and located on the northeastern corner of MacArthur  Boulevard and Main Street, the project was master-planned by M. Paul Friedberg  &amp; Partners of New York to encompass 4.5 million square feet of office,  hotel, retail, dining, entertainment and residential space.  </P> <P> BGS Partners is owner/developer of the 66 acres. BCE Development Inc. (BCED),  affiliated with Bell Canada Enterprises, is the managing general partner.  </P> <P> BCED will develop the first office building -- an 11-story, $50-million  structure, designed by Gensler &amp; Associates/Architects and built by the  Austin Co. -- starting in August, simultaneously with the housing.  </P> <P> MacArthur Place also will have 400 condominium units to be rented as  apartments. Torriero is a principal in Griffin/Related Properties, which plans  to develop the housing. Griffin and the Sakiokas are limited partners in BGS.  </P> <P> Referring to the housing, Griffin executive Matthew Witte said, "This part of  the project will be unique for Orange County, because the housing will be built  on top of 150,000 square feet of retail space."  </P> <P> The condos will be above ground-level stores in several mid-rise buildings on  11 acres, with parks on one side and office buildings on the other.  </P> <P> The developers are calling MacArthur Place "an urban village," but that  primarily applies to the housing part, Witte said, "because it is the only  place in the whole project where there will be housing and retail."  </P> <P> The vice president of office centers for BCED, Murray Hay, said, "When we think  about it as an urban village, we see a mix of uses, with people living and  working in the area instead of feeding into traffic patterns."  </P> <P> Traffic was an issue that barred other developments, including a 20,500-seat  sports arena called Westdome, from the site, but traffic remains an issue  despite unanimous City Council approval of MacArthur Place.  </P> <P> Richard Merritt, a resident who describes himself as "the ramrod behind the  (1986) protests against Westdome," said, "Roger (Torriero) is a good  psychologist. He won us over by having those meetings."  </P> <P> Those meetings were held by Torriero on a regular basis after he became  interested in the site and enlisted BCED's participation. Torriero formed what  became known as the Stakeholders Council, composed of residents with a stake in  the neighborhood. The meetings were held to keep the residents up to date on  the development and answer their questions.  </P> <P> Vicki Uehli, project manager with the city's Community Development Agency, said  Torriero convinced the residents that his was a different type of development,  "so he overrode any objections." The project sailed through the approval  processes with no public dissent, Uehli noted.  </P> <P> Merritt said he and other residents disapproved of earlier attempts by other  developers to build a sports arena on the site. "But traffic was the big  factor, and it will still be unbelievable," he said. "The city has given us a  lot of ideas about how traffic will be improved, but I doubt that I will see  any solutions in my lifetime."  </P> <P> Traffic is already congested in the area, he added, and it will only grow worse  with the 15,000 jobs expected to be created with MacArthur Place.  </P> <P> Traffic also concerns Helen Brown, executive director of Civic Center Barrio, a  Santa Ana group born in the 1970s to develop housing for barrio residents  displaced by redevelopment. MacArthur Place is in a redevelopment area.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Criticizes Project  </P> <P> Said Brown:  </P> <P> "This is the most ill-planned project I ever saw. The 55 Freeway dumps into  MacArthur Boulevard. Hutton Place, with its office towers, dumps into  MacArthur. So do the industrial buildings and condominiums already there. And  now they have the nerve to go in there and put in 400 new housing units? We'll  spend 45 minutes to go one mile."  </P> <P> She is less critical of the traffic than the housing, however. She said none of  it will be set aside for low- and moderate-income residents, though Santa Ana  suffers from a severe shortage of low-income rental housing. The monthly  rentals will range from about $600 to $1,100.  </P> <P> Crystal Sims of the Legal Aid Foundation in Santa Ana said, "There is concern  with a lot of housing advocates that the city is not spending what it should on  low-income housing."  </P> <P> Generally, 20% of the housing in a redevelopment area is reserved for people  with low incomes, but Uehli said:  </P> <P> "As MacArthur Place develops, it will generate a tax increment, and 20% will be  set aside for low-income housing. So they (the developers) are not bound to  develop it on their site. The tax increment will benefit low-income housing  citywide."  </P> <P> City Manager David N. Ream said, "First-time ownership is something we're  trying to promote in various other projects in the city, but the (MacArthur  Place) apartments will provide a much needed amenity in the southeastern part  of the city."  </P></p>

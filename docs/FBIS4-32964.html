			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Herold Jean-Francois] </F>   [Text] Port-au-Prince, 31 May (EFE) -- The Haitian National  Assembly special session summoned this morning by Constitutional  President Jean-Bertrand Aristide will not be held because  parliamentarians have complained about security problems.    Senate Vice President Firmin Jean-Louis indicated he had  contacted several legislators who expressed their willingness to  participate in the special session, but stated their  apprehension with respect to its feasibility.    Nevertheless, Jean-Louis disclosed that those  parliamentarians contacted "reiterated their recognition of  Aristide as legitimate president and expressed their willingness  to respond favorably to his summons today and from here on."    On the other hand, this Tuesday, Deputy Antoine Joseph,  former president of the Chamber of Deputies, stated Aristide is  entitled to convene the parliamentarians, but he believed the  president should have contacted the parliament's political  groups before summoning the National Assembly.    The deputy criticized Senate President Jean-Louis, who was  in  a position to make the contacts prior to the president's  summons. Joseph also pointed to the security problems the  legislators are having and the unlikelihood the summons will  come through.    Another reason, Joseph indicated, was the position adopted  by  Jean-Louis with respect to the 2 March parliamentary resolution  that attempted to solve the crisis through Aristide's  appointment of a prime minister, the retirement of General Raoul  Cedras, and the implementation of an amnesty law. Joseph  stressed that the Chamber of Deputies does not recognize the "de  facto" government headed by Judge Emile Jonassaint.    In a letter dated 26 May and sent to Jean-Louis, Aristide  urges the senate president to take the necessary provisions to  summon the National Assembly on 1 June to express an opinion on  the "11 May charade" and the illegal appointment of Jonassaint  as de facto president by a group of senators headed by Bernard  Sansaricq.    In the meantime, press reports from Haiti point out the  deployment of troops on the border with Santo Domingo in  response to the Dominican Government's commitment to control the  smuggling of crude-oil-related products through the border  shared by both Caribbean nations.    As a result of these new measures, the price of gasoline  increased drastically in the free market, and this Monday and  Tuesday, a gallon of gasoline could be purchased for $10. A  military source told EFE that the Army has large amounts of  gasoline for its military vehicles and those used by the  high-ranking officers.    On the other hand, if the price of gasoline continues to  increase, public transportation will be crippled in a very short  while, and private owners will be forced to leave their vehicles  parked at home because of the lack of resources to confront  rising prices on the black market.</p>

			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Government accused of 'learning no lessons and doing very little' over sinking of tanker Braer The government was accused yesterday of 'learning no lessons and doing very little' as a result of the sinking of the tanker Braer in Shetland a year ago today, James Buxton writes. Mr Jim Wallace, Liberal Democrat MP for Orkney and Shetland, said the government had refused to hold a public inquiry into the disaster, the wreckage of which can still be seen off Garth Ness (above). The government has yet to publish the report by the Marine Accident Investigation Branch into the disaster and has refused to provide radar surveillance of the channel between Shetland and Orkney. The inquiry on marine safety around the British Isles has also yet to report. The Liberian-registered Braer spilled 85,000 tonnes of crude oil when it grounded. About 1,500 sea birds died but storms dispersed the oil. The Shetland salmon farming industry lost about Pounds 20m because some fish were contaminated and became unsaleable.</p>

			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / The Markets: Doom, gloom, record profits - The Bottom Line Jeremy Lancaster, who has turned Wolseley into the biggest supplier of heating and plumbing equipment in the world, is frank about his pessimism. 'I'm just not an optimistic guy,' he said, after announcing yet another set of record results on Tuesday. However, after 20 odd years the City is beginning to catch on to his downbeat manner. Pre-tax profits for the year to July 31 came in at Pounds 202.3m, at the top end of analysts' expectations. This was 67 per cent up from the previous year, when Wolseley surprised the City with profits of Pounds 121.1m - well ahead of the top forecast of Pounds 115m. The results are remarkable enough, given the recession. Even more remarkable is the latest earnings per share figure of 50.77p, up from 33.60p for 1993 and 37 per cent ahead of the previous record EPS of 37p in 1990. The growth has come from across the group's operations. 'There hasn't been a laggard amongst them,' said Lancaster. Leading the field last year was the US, where profits from building distribution leapt from Pounds 47m to Pounds 86.8m on turnover up from Pounds 1.21bn to Pounds 1.72bn. The first full contribution from Erb Lumber, bought last September, was Pounds 13.5m. Erb and Carolina Builders, both timber distributors, have been 'on a roll for two years', with 30 per cent annual sales growth. But sales in the US plumbing distribution operations also improved strongly, with Ferguson Enterprises 22 per cent ahead, Familian Northwest 20 per cent, and Familian in California ahead by more than 3 per cent and back in the black. 'We have a reputation for being extreme pessimists which I'm happy with  - but even we do not think the US will be too bad next year,' Lancaster said, adding that the rate of growth was likely to slow down. The improvement in European building distribution was not quite so dramatic, with profits rising from Pounds 57.1m to Pounds 81m on sales up from Pounds 1bn to Pounds 1.14bn. Of special interest was Brossette, which managed to maintain margins and lift sales by more than 5 per cent in a difficult French market. The successful export of the Wolseley formula to France bodes well for OAG, the biggest distributor of plumbing supplies in Austria bought last April for Pounds 56.9m. Wolseley sounded warning on the UK, although the results were good, especially since two-thirds of sales go into the still-depressed repair and maintenance market. The British recovery was fragile, and it was impossible to predict the housing market. Margins in the US and UK are near their peaks, however, which puts the onus on increasing volumes and better results from the manufacturing side. Manufacturing sales were ahead just 3 per cent at Pounds 390.3m, yielding profits of Pounds 36.6m, up 11 per cent. The group believes expansion is possible in all markets. It went to the US in 1982 because it was worried about the prospects for expansion in the UK. At the time it had 300 UK outlets, which have grown to 444; US outlets have risen from 52 to 416. The balance sheet is strong, with gearing of just over 10 per cent, so further acquisitions are likely. In June the group paid Pounds 28m for Calumet Holdings of Chicago, a deal which it believes has made it the world's leading distributor of professional photographic equipment. Calumet is strong in mail order, an expertise Wolseley would like to transfer to other parts of the group. The City is looking for further growth, with profits forecast at Pounds 240m and earnings at around 58p. The shares, which closed at 752p last Friday, fell to 725p after the results were announced on Tuesday, partly because the figures did not top the forecasts. By the close yesterday they had more than recovered the losses. The question of succession remains. Richard Ireland, finance director, retires next month and will be replaced by Steve Webster, who joined as deputy finance director in summer. Lancaster, 58, is widely expected to retire in two years. Perhaps that is why he was so keen on Tuesday to play down the importance of individuals to the group's performance, and why most of the board attended the results meetings.</p>

			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Tax treatment of dividends My stepmother died on April 30 last year and my brother and I are her principal beneficiaries. A probate valuation, prepared by stockbrokers, showed income due to her on stocks which had gone ex-dividend before April 30. This income was capitalised as part of her estate and inheritance tax was paid on the total, including this income. Since the income was not received until after April 30, though, as executor I included it in the income tax return I prepared for her for the period April 6-30 1993. But the Inland Revenue refused to take account of it in calculating a tax refund for that period on the ground that it had not been received by the time of her death. I accepted this ruling and assume that it is correct. I am concerned about the tax treatment of this income now. The dividends have come to my brother and me, although as part of the capital of the estate. It seems to me, therefore, that we should not include it in our tax returns as part of our income for the year just ending. Am I right? Ask your stepmother's tax office for the free pamphlet IR45 (What happens when someone dies). We are surprised that the officer who (correctly) deleted the post-death dividends from the pre-death claim did not even bother to tell you that this helpful leaflet existed. You might wish to send a formal protest on this point to the district inspector (whose name should be printed on the tax office's letterhead). You will see from the IR45 that, broadly speaking: 1. Half of each dividend paid after your stepmother's death forms part of your own income of 1993-94, and the other half forms part of your brother's income. 2. A measure of relief from higher-rate tax will be due to each of you in respect of the inheritance tax that is attributable to those dividends (according to an arbitrary formula). 3. As executor, you should issue tax certificates R185E to your brother and to yourself (as beneficiaries) in respect of the dividends paid between your stepmother's death and the winding-up of her estate. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

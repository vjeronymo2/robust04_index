			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Tube to unveil Heathrow plans London Underground will today unveil plans for a Pounds 70m 1 1/4 -mile extension of the Piccadilly Line to the proposed fifth terminal at Heathrow Airport. If London Underground's plans are approved work could start in 1997 and the new extension and station would become operational in 2002, when Terminal 5 is due to open. The Underground is applying to Mr Brian Mawhinney, transport secretary, for permission to extend the line under the Transport and Works Act - avoiding the need for a parliamentary bill. Objectors have seven weeks to register their concerns with the Department of Transport. These will then be considered by London Underground and Heathrow Airport. A public inquiry into Terminal 5 is expected to start in May. Work will involve an extension west of the existing station for Heathrow terminals 1, 2 and 3. All trains will serve that station with some running on to Terminal 4 and some to Terminal 5. About 30m air passengers are expected to use Terminal 5 each year. Work on the Pounds 300m Heathrow Express rail link between Heathrow and Paddington Station was stopped after a tunnel collapse last month.</p>

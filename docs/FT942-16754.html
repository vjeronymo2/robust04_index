			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Leading Article: Chinese order President Clinton must view recent events in China with apprehension. They could place him in an appalling dilemma - partly of his own making - when he comes in early June, around the fifth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, to decide whether to renew China's most-favoured nation trading status. He said last year that he would do so only if there were a significant improvement in human rights in China. The latest detentions of dissidents make it no easier for him to assert to the US Congress that there has been such an improvement. He could find himself obliged - by the timetable and conditions which he himself set - to revoke MFN, a step which would have serious consequences for American business, for the Chinese economy and its reform programme, for world trade, and for multilateral co-operation on issues such as nuclear arms. A great deal can happen in two months, so it is as well to tread cautiously. China may take steps which would make MFN renewal more palatable to the US human rights lobby. Efforts to interpret the latest investigations of Mr Wei Jingsheng, China's most prominent dissident, are made without knowledge of their motivation. But those behind the detentions of Mr Wei and others are clearly unconcerned about reprisals. They may have been persuaded by US businessmen that Mr Clinton would not revoke MFN. Or they may feel that Beijing must not, whatever the consequences, be seen to accede to foreign meddling in its affairs. Internal stability is of over-riding importance to China's Communist leaders, as the events of 1989 showed. To them, continued dominance depends on preventing the ignition of any movement which pulls together various strands of disaffection, much of it stirred by the effects of economic reform. While most in the west would not condone Beijing's authoritarian methods of maintaining domestic order, they would also agree that economic reform offers the best chance of leading China to a more prosperous and fairer society. There are divisions within the Clinton administration about the wisdom of a policy which places annual MFN renewal at the centre of Sino-American relations. The commerce department has made no bones of its belief that US business stands to be seriously damaged by invocation of an arbitrary deadline set in Washington. To be fair, the administration has moved to broaden the relationship, attempting to make human rights only one among the subjects to be discussed in more frequent two-way visits by officials. It should continue to do so. While making clear its distaste for Chinese methods, the west has an over-riding interest in seeking Chinese participation in trade accords, prevention of nuclear proliferation, and co-operation on specific issues such as North Korea. Ways of escaping Mr Clinton's MFN dilemma, short of a politically damaging retreat, are not apparent - for example, removal of MFN only from goods produced by the public sector would be difficult to enforce. If he does not succeed, his much-vaunted aim of greater Asia-Pacific co-operation will be as nought. The sympathies of most Asian countries, which accord less priority to human rights than does the US, will lie with China.</p>

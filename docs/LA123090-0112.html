			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HART TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> HART ENJOYS ITS OWN PARTY FOR A CHANGE  </P> <P> For 19 years, Hart High has played host to a tournament. And for 19 years, Hart  has watched someone else pick up the championship trophy.  </P> <P> With eight second-place finishes, the Indians had more reason to claim No. 2  than Avis.  </P> <P> That all changed Saturday when Hart beat East Bakersfield, 55-54, to win the  title.  </P> <P> "Between my teammates and coaches, we'd heard it too much," Hart forward Ali  Peek said of Hart's inability to win the tournament.  </P> <P> Coach Greg Herrick had a different point of view.  </P> <P> "It's no monkey off my back," he said. "I won this tournament twice while I was  at Cleveland (1983, 1984). But it is unusual that a school doesn't win its own  tournament."  </P> <P> And the Indians (9-5) have Marty Downen to thank. Downen stole an inbounds pass  under his own basket with three seconds left to preserve the win.  </P> <P> Downen, who scored 10 points, was named the tournament's most valuable player.  </P> <P> Teammate Peek added 12 points and five blocked shots, and Tony Valenzuela  contributed 11 points.  </P> <P> In other games:  </P> <P> Saugus 61, Antelope Valley 42 -- Saugus went almost seven minutes without  scoring in the first quarter, and fell behind, 9-1, in the third-place game.  </P> <P> But the Centurions (10-4) went on a 22-9 spree in the second period to take a  lead they did not relinquish.  </P> <P> Beverly Hills 60, Rio Mesa 55 -- Jonah Naulls scored 23 points to pace the  Normans in the consolation championship. Rio Mesa (3-7) got 16 points from Greg  Bellman and 10 from David Halvorsen.  </P> <P> Glendale 70, Calabasas 57 -- Jerry Armen scored 22 points in leading the  Dynamiters (9-5) in the fifth-place game. Greg Waugh had 13 points for the  Coyotes.  </P> <P> Palmdale 68, Cabrillo 42 -- Jason Grimes scored 18 points for the Falcons in a  consolation-bracket game.  </P></p>

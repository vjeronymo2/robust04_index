The session was convened to relay and implement the  spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Discipline  Inspection Committee and arrange for Hunan's anticorruption work  in 1994.    Yesterday's meeting was attended by more than 600 people,  including provincial party, government, and military leaders,  such as Wang Maolin, Yang Zhengwu, Yang Minzhi, Luo Haifan, Wang  Keying, Wen Xuande, Shen Ruiting, Zhou Shichang, Zhuo Kangning,  Liu Tingying, and Huang Shigen; provincial discipline inspection  commission members; prefectural, autonomous prefectural, and  city party committee secretaries or deputy secretaries in charge  of discipline inspection work; prefectural, autonomous  prefectural, and city discipline inspection commission  secretaries and supervision bureau chiefs; leading party group  secretaries, discipline inspection group leaders or secretaries,  and supervision office directors of the units directly under the  provincial authorities; retired veteran leaders of the  provincial discipline inspection commission and supervision  department; and other leaders.    Yesterday's meeting was presided over by Yang Minzhi,  provincial party committee standing committee member and  provincial discipline inspection commission secretary.    Provincial party committee Secretary Wang Maolin delivered  an  important speech divided into the following three parts:    1. Conscientiously implement Comrade Jiang Zemin's important  speech as well as the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the  Central Discipline Inspection Committee.    2. Fruitfully, consistently, and profoundly carry out the  anticorruption struggle.    3. Further Strengthen leadership over the anticorruption  struggle.    Secretary Wang Maolin emphatically stated in his speech: In  order to implement to the letter the spirit of the Third Plenary  Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Committee, we  should first and foremost appraise the anticorruption struggle  in the previous period, strengthen confidence in the  anticorruption struggle, and profoundly and protractedly carry  on the anticorruption struggle. At the moment, we should  further heighten and unify understanding in this connection,  this being of paramount importance.    Secretary Wang Maolin pointed out: We should see to it that  leading cadres at all levels in Hunan continually remain honest  and strictly abide by discipline in discharging official duties.  To this end, the provincial, prefectural, autonomous  prefectural, and county party committees leaders, as well as the  principal party and government leaders at all levels in the  province, should take the lead and set a good example in the  anticorruption struggle. We should waste no time in  investigating and handling major and serious corruption cases,  severely punish corrupt elements, and resolutely put an end to  those malpractices that have caused strong resentment among the  broad masses of people. To this end, first and foremost, we  should make continued efforts to wipe out all unreasonable  administrative charges and service fees. Second, we should  strictly investigate and handle cases of commercializing the  party and state powers as well as such cases as distortion,  blackmail, holding banquets at public expense, demanding gifts,  and so on. Third, we should make continued efforts to put an  end to such malpractices as making overseas and domestic trips  at public expense. Fourth, we should be cautious in handing  economic entities run by party or government organs. Fifth, we  should strictly investigate and ban such malpractices as party  and government organs or functionaries using, by abusing their  powers, vehicles, computers, telephones, and other types of  equipment of enterprises without compensation and such  malpractices as party and government organs making unauthorized  use of enterprises' funds under various pretexts for their own  financial purposes. Moreover, we should make redoubled efforts  to eradicate such malpractices as party or government organs  making unauthorized use of public funds to decorate offices and  residences or installing central air-conditioners and  residential telephone lines, and resolutely put an end to  extravagance and waste as well.    Secretary Wang Maolin asserted: The enterprises should also  step up clean government building and wipe out all sorts of  corrupt phenomena. In combating corruption, we should make  persistent efforts to rectify and eradicate each and every  malpractice by looking into both root causes and symptoms. The  anticorruption struggle conforms, he noted, with the fundamental  interests of the party and state and enjoys popular support  among the people. So long as we strictly follow the basic work  principles worked out by the central authorities, unswervingly  rely on the party organizations and the broad masses of people,  and work with one heart and one mind and in a down-to-earth  manner, we will certainly be able to attain more tangible  results in the first-stage anticorruption struggle in 1994,  thereby making due contributions to the overall work of the  party!</p>

			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Samuel Heath falls Interim pre-tax profits at Samuel Heath &amp; Sons, the hardware and giftware company, fell 24 per cent from Pounds 136,000 to Pounds 103,000, on turnover ahead 22 per cent at Pounds 1.05m, compared with Pounds 857,000. Earnings per share for the half-year to September 30 dipped to 2.3p (3p) but the interim dividend is maintained at 1.5p. Mr Samuel Heath, chairman, said the result reflected a 'dramatic' rise in the cost of raw materials, particularly copper. He also warned that a serious fire at the company's Birmingham factory since the the period-end, and the consequent breakdown in customer service, was likely to have 'ill effects' in the future.</p>

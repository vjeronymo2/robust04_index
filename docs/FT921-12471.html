			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Envoy tests water for Yugoslavia peace force A SPECIAL envoy of the United Nations yesterday began a five-day mission in Yugoslavia to determine whether it will be possible to deploy 10,000 peacekeepers. Mr Marrack Goulding, UN under-secretary in charge of peacekeeping forces, will decide whether the 23-day-old UN-brokered ceasefire is stable enough for peacekeeping forces to enter Croatia's war zones. The ceasefire yesterday appeared to be holding in most battle zones. Croatian radio said a three-year-old Croatian boy was killed when a bomb exploded in Karlovac, central Croatia. Serbian media reported sporadic shooting in eastern Croatia and in Zadar, an Adriatic port. During his mission, Mr Goulding, a Briton, will talk to Serb leaders from Krajina, a Serb enclave in Croatia, who oppose the UN plan calling for the Serb-dominated federal army to withdraw from Croatia. He will also meet federal, Serb and Croat government officials and army leaders. In a sign of the economic devastation caused by the seven-month-old war, the Yugoslav dinar, the national currency, was devalued yesterday by 80 per cent. The Serb-controlled federal government said the new rate would be 65 dinars, instead of 13, to DM1, reported Tanjug news agency. The new rate is closer to the thriving black market rate of up to 110 dinars.</p>

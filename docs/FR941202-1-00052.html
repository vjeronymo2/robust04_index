			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Suspension Hearing and Decision <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 6101.19(a)(2) has been amended to change the timing of a protest suspension hearing in order to conform to Section 1433(a)(2) of the FASA. A protest suspension hearing is one in which the Board determines whether to suspend the Administrator's procurement authority or delegation of procurement authority until the protest can be decided. An interested party may request a suspension hearing if the underlying protest if filed on the later of (1) the tenth day after the date of contract award; or (2) the fifth day after the debriefing date for any debriefing that is requested and required. The Board must hold the suspension hearing within 5 days after the date the protest was filed, or in the case of a request for debriefing, within 5 days after the later of the date of the filing of the protest or the date of the debriefing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 6101.19(d) (Suspension decision) has been amended to include language specified by Section 1433(a)(1)(C) of the FASA. If a contract award has not been made, a suspension shall not preclude the Federal agency whose procurement authority has been suspended from continuing the procurement process up to but not including contract award, unless the Board determines such action is not in the best interests of the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Settlement Agreements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A new paragraph has been added to Section 6101.28 (Dismissals) which incorporates the language specified by Section 1436 of the FASA. Section 6101.28(d) provides that any settlement agreement that dismisses a protest and involves a direct or indirect expenditure of appropriated funds shall be submitted to the Board and made part of the public record, subject to any protective order considered appropriate by the Board. If a Federal agency is a party to the agreement, the submission of the agreement to the Board must include a memorandum signed by the contracting officer that describes in detail the procurement, the grounds for protest, the Government's position regarding those grounds, the terms of the settlement, and the agency's position regarding the propriety of the award or proposed award of the contract at issue in the protest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 48 CFR Chapter 61, Part 6101 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Government procurement. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set out in the preamble, 41 CFR Part 6101 is proposed to be amended as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=56 g=1 f=1 --> PART 6101_RULES OF THE GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION BOARD OF CONTRACT APPEALS <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

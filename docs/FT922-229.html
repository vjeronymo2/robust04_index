			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / International Bonds: HSBC's deal may herald similar funding of bids THE SMOOTH completion of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's crucial bond financing of its Pounds 3.6bn takeover of Midland Bank could herald further bond market funding of bids. Two working days after Hongkong Bank won acceptance for its takeover offer, the first round of the underwriting of HSBC Holdings' Pounds 448m 10-year subordinated Eurobond has been completed, and investors are queueing up to buy further bonds issued, as shareholders' acceptances continue to drift in, until July 10. Companies typically raise funds to finance takeovers through bilateral or syndicated bank borrowing, or by issuing shares. Often, bank loans are subsequently refinanced in the bond market, but bond offerings are rarely an integral part of a takeover bid. However, the diminishing availability of bank financing and a less bullish stock market could encourage more companies to consider tapping the bond market. From Hongkong Bank's point of view, the subordinated Eurobonds provide useful capital and avoid excessive dilution of shareholders' funds. In retrospect, it was the offer of more generous terms on the bonds - and a cash alternative - when Hongkong Bank increased its bid on June 2, which helped secure the deal by edging out rival Lloyds Bank. Initially, the bonds were to be priced to yield 160 basis points above the 10-year gilt yield, a spread which was widely considered inadequate given the credit quality of the offering: deeply subordinated debt issued by a bank holding company. Research circulated by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew concluded that the bank 'has significantly over-valued its proposed issue of subordinated bonds,' and suggested a valuation of around 210 basis points. Under the increased bid, Hongkong Bank offered par bonds at a spread of 240 basis points above the comparable gilt yield, and a cash alternative for investors who did not want to take the bonds. For each 100 shares in Midland, shareholders were offered 120 shares in the new Hongkong Bank holding company after the merger and either Pounds 65 of bonds or Pounds 65 in cash. Although existing shareholders who do not wish to take up the bonds can take the cash alternative, many may have taken the view that the bonds offer better value. Since the spread has already tightened, shareholders who took the bonds are set to make a tidy profit. The offering is the first of its kind in the Eurobond market. Because Eurobonds are internationally-traded bearer instruments, the structure has facilitated distribution to a much wider range of investors than would have been possible with a domestic sterling bonds. For example, a substantial portion of paper is expected to end up in the US. The existence of broad overseas demand has helped buoy confidence in the UK, where the structure of the deal could have severely limited distribution. For lead manager Credit Suisse First Boston the underwriting risk was substantial. When CSFB agreed to underwrite the offer on June 2, the underwriting period could have lasted for 10 weeks, with no protection under force majeure or material 'adverse change' clauses. To compensate for the high level of the underwriting risk, CSFB was paid fees of 1 percentage point. In addition, the generous 240 basis point spread was designed to provide a certain cushion for potential adverse market movements. CSFB and other members of the syndicate began taking orders late Tuesday, and book-building continued on Wednesday and Thursday. On Thursday night, the number of investors opting for a cash alternative created a tranche of bonds for sale on Friday totalling Pounds 101m. This represented around half the total amount of acceptances. The bonds were sold at a fixed price of 101.20, indicating a spread of 220 basis points, but by the end of trading on Friday the bonds were bid at 102.45 for a spread of 204 basis points. A further Pounds 15m tranche of bonds is to be sold today. According to Mr Hugh Corbett, a UBS analyst, the spread was 'quite a bit wider than necessary to get the issue away', an opinion borne out by the substantial tightening of the spread. Officials at CSFB expect that 'the spread will settle at around 200 basis points. If the bank performs, there is room for further tightening'.</p>

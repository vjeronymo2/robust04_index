			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Travel: Royal approval - Skiing WHEN THE Duchess of York visited Altenmarkt in Austria recently, she became one of the latest people to discover the pleasures of this little-known town and its big ski area. Altenmarkt is known mainly for being the home of the Atomic ski factory and the Steffner ski sweater plant. If your business is not at one of those places, then it is easy to miss Altenmarkt. Many do. They roar along the motorway from Salzburg and turn off to St Johann in Pongau and Zell-am-Zee, or drive on to Schladming and Obertauern, all of which are better known than Altenmarkt. Yet Altenmarkt does not deserve to be overshadowed. It is the mother town of a ski region that is far bigger than many more fashionable areas. The locals refer to Zauchensee - the resort six miles from Altenmarkt - as a ski paradise. I do not think they are exaggerating. The Amade ski area of which Zauchensee is the hub provides 320 kms of skiing spread across five valleys and six mountains. In Austria, Altenmarkt is known as a schneeloch, or snow hole, because it gathers snow from the west and south whereas most other resorts receive snow from only one direction. Another advantage is that it is so close to Salzburg. It is only a 45-minute ride from Salzburg airport. I once landed at Salzburg airport at 3.40, cleared customs by 3.50, was in my hotel in Altenmarkt by 4.50 and had rented skis and boots by 5.30. Altenmarkt has a population of 3,000. It has some shops that would not look out of place in London's Bond Street as well as a sports centre with two indoor tennis courts, two squash courts, swimming pool, Turkish and sauna baths, and a floodlit cross-country skiing trail. Best of all, there is an onion-topped church with magnificent bells that boom out the half-hour and hour. Like many Austrian ski resorts, Zauchensee has grown enormously in the past 20 years - and with it Altenmarkt. Germans from nearby Munich as well as Austrians from Salzburg and Vienna have discovered the pretty town. They have brought prosperity to it but clogged its streets with cars. 'Everybody likes to get bigger but the problem with many villages is that they have too many buildings,' says Eddie Kocher, head of the tourist office. 'You have to walk for 20 minutes to see a green field. 'That must not happen here. We have 3,000 beds, the same number as we had ten years ago, and we like that. We do not want to get bigger. People come to Altenmarkt and say: 'This is a village. It has a family atmosphere.' This must not change. Our job over the next 20 years is to improve on, not spoil, the success of the past 20 years.'</p>

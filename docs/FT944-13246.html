			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): A quicker lease of life for batteries A common complaint from users of equipment such as laptop computers is the time it takes to recharge batteries. Most chargers take several hours, while those that work more rapidly usually shorten the batteries' life. DSB Special Batteries, a Sussex-based company formerly owned by Duracell Batteries, has introduced technology which cuts the charging time for nickel cadmium or nickel metal hydride battery packs to less than 30 minutes, while extending the battery life by around 50 per cent. The DSB system uses a charge control chip, developed by Integrated Circuit Systems of the US, which avoids shortening the life of the battery by stopping the process before it is fully charged. It speeds up the charging process by including a discharge pulse in every charge cycle which prevents crystalline deposits from forming. The discharge pulse also overcomes the 'memory' effect, whereby batteries that are not fully discharged before recharging lose their capacity to become fully charged.

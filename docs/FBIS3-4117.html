			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>   [Excerpt] Central and provincial leaders yesterday held a  national conference on farming, which is expected to recommend  measures to boost Beijing's control over the vital sector. And  major banks announced last night they would earmark special  funds to help farmers procure raw materials.    Chinese sources said in spite of the satisfactory harvests  last year, the leadership was worried that the desired yields  for staples such as grain, cotton and other foodstuff would  gradually fall because of farmers' dwindling enthusiasm for  these traditional pursuits. A key item on the agenda yesterday  was the extent to which procurement prices should be raised.  Moreover, to prevent the recurrence of the peasant riots last  year, the authorities weighed the possibilities of further  lowering agrarian taxes.    In a circular yesterday, banks, including the People's Bank  of China and the Agriculture Bank, said they would ensure that  farmers get enough loans for supplies such as fertilizers and  pesticides.    "To ensure that farmers can carry out their seasonal work,  loans to them should be distributed in good time," the circular  added. Analysts said Beijing wanted to reimpose some form of  production quotas on various provinces with regard to essential  produce.    However, regions, particularly industrialized provinces such  as Guangdong, had raised objections. Last week, legislators  from Guangdong were told they should no longer rely on grain  from other provinces or on imports. [passage omitted]</p>

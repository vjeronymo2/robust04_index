			<p><P> December 10, 1990, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> DEBT-RIDDEN RICHMOND DISTRICT OUSTS SCHOOLS SUPERINTENDENT  </P> <P> After months of rumors, the Richmond school board has ousted Supt. Walter Marks  amid concern that he was jeopardizing the district's chances of getting a  second emergency bailout loan from the state.  </P> <P> Marks was hired three years ago to make changes but is leaving the district in  financial chaos. The district, which had a $141.5-million budget this year,  could run out of money by next February, one state legislator said.  </P> <P> The district, which faces an estimated $25-million shortfall for next year,  received a $9-million loan from the state earlier this year and is forced to  ask for an additional $25 million.  </P> <P> "The consensus of opinion was that if we were going to have a good shot of  seeing this loan, Marks would have to go," said Assemblyman Robert J. Campbell  (D-Richmond), who called the district "the worst example of a public agency not  being run well."  </P> <P> Marks will leave Dec. 31 and will be paid $93,989 to buy out the remainder of  his four-year contract. His salary was $112,566 a year to oversee the  30,000-student district.  </P> <P> "When push came to shove, somebody had to go and it's me because I wanted it to  be," Marks said. "I've wanted it for a long time. I've done all I can do --  both good and bad."  </P> <P> Fred Stewart, a state trustee who has been overseeing the district since the  governor approved the first loan last summer, said it will take "a miracle" to  save the 48-school Richmond Unified School District.  </P> <P> "The district is in a very deep hole, and it's going to take the combination of  a lot of support from a lot of people before this problem is solved," he said.  "I have never seen a district in such financial condition."  </P> <P> Campbell said the board blamed the controversial superintendent for introducing  innovative programs without considering how to pay for them.  </P></p>

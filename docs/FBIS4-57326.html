			<p>BFN     [Text] Trinidad, Santa Barbara -- President Roberto Reina  yesterday said that the potable water and electric energy  services will not receive a 7 percent tax, as international  financial organizations have recommended. Reina, who presided  over the commemoration of the 200th anniversary of this city's  founding, thus refuted Deputy Finance Minister Ramiro Lozano  Landa, who had reported that those services would be taxed.  "Every report should be released positively rather than  negatively. The country's problem is its economic situation,  which was not created by this government but handed down from  the previous one. We are trying to solve it," he said.    He pointed out that by the human face he so much referred to  in his political campaign he meant to avoid, as much as humanly  possible, imposing too much of a burden on the country's popular  and lowly classes. "This is the battle I am waging. If you  journalists do not help me, you will be opposing the Honduran  history," he said. Nevertheless, he said that, if new taxes have  to be established, they should be applied on those who are  economically stronger. "I would regard this as the right  direction."    Regarding a report by Byron Suazo, Liberal Party deputy for  La Paz Department, saying that the confidential fund had not  been suspended as Reina had promised in his campaign, but had  its name changed to humanitarian fund, the president said the  report is aimed at tarnishing his moral revolution. Reina  admitted that the presidency incurs in "normal expenditures" but  that every single cent disbursed is audited.    As for the third fuel price increase decreed in three  months,  the president said the prices of oil by-products do not depend  on his administration but on international market prices. "The  country experiences a difficult situation. If we do not control  the current inflation, we would enter into an even more  difficult situation. It is not the government, but inflation,  which harasses the people. We are trying to solve the problem,"  he said.    He said if fuel prices are lowered on the international  market those prices will automatically be lowered in the country  by the same percentage. He added that the people should be  defended by preventing taxes from pressuring them. "This is the  tragedy that we have been experiencing."    Reina said his government is in the process of outlining a  regulation to protect the country's forests. He remarked that,  as the result of demand by the majority of the people, he has  ordered the cutting of trees stopped. He said he took the  measure because of the way forests are being destroyed. He  described forests as vital to prevent river basins from drying  up. If this happens, the country would be left without water.  He affirmed that he will maintain his position and that he will  not accept pressure from government officials who own lumber  mills.    Reina also said he never promised to make public the names  of  the former officials involved in corruption. He said that he  had pledged to give the names of the institutions where these  officials worked and that this is what he did.    Regarding the money that the government plans to lend  peasants for agricultural activities, Reina said that Natural  Resources Minister Ramon Villeda Bermudez has already reported  on how the farmers will be aided.    [Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish at 2051 GMT on 14 May  reports  that Deputy Finance Minister Ramiro Lozano had announced that  the government would tax potable water, telephone, and electric  energy services. Lozano reportedly had also announced taxes on  school materials, cable television, and videos, and that these  taxes were necessary because of World Bank and IMF demands.]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Martin S. Lambeck: "Resistance Against Scharping </F> Forming in SPD"]    [Text] Bonn -- After a meeting of the party's managing  board, Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] Chairman Rudolf  Scharping for the third time this week felt compelled to call  for unity within his party. This time, his appeal was  particularly self-critical and dramatic. The SPD leadership has  found "unanimously" that the party has lost the clear lead in  voters' support over the past few weeks "also through its own  fault." Scharping threatened to tick off critics in public  should they blemish the image of party unity in the future.    Commenting on statements by Lower Saxony Minister-President  Gerhard Schroeder, Scharping said that this reminds him of  earlier traditions in the party that have been acted out "ad  nauseam" and which "are not very helpful." In an interview  Schroeder had said that Scharping should conduct an election  campaign against Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl (Christian  Democratic Union --CDU) instead of fighting with President elect  Roman Herzog, or even soccer trainer Berti Vogts.    Scharping admitted that the situation "is not as favorable  for the SPD as would be desirable." The candidate for  chancellor also admitted that he has made mistakes -- thus, he  had reacted "angrily" to the election of Union candidate Roman  Herzog as president. At the same time, he is convinced that he  will win the elections. But in SPD leadership circles,  criticism of the SPD election campaign is growing. An  increasing number of members speak of a "current low" in voters'  support for the party.    Critics say, only secretly so far, that Scharping has bad  advisers and that his election campaign schedule is far too  tight. The candidate's surroundings complain that the press work  done for Scharping is lousy. Thus, no one considered it  necessary to mention that the SPD chairman spoke before an  audience of 30,000 in Dortmund last week. Quote: "The  marketing of our top man is simply bad!" The whole campaign is a  weak imitation of the Clinton campaign in the United States,  without taking into account the fact that the American situation  cannot simply be transferred to Germany. Also, it was not  realized in time that the motto "Time for a Change" is not very  suitable at a time when the German economy is recovering.    The same fears have been voiced concerning Gerhard Schroeder  and Oskar Lafontaine, SPD economics expert and Scharping deputy.  What is striking is that the two minister-presidents, known to  be opponents, have been praising each other on several occasions  recently. Both officially deny that they doubt the victory of  their candidate Scharping. But at the same time the behavior of  the two rivals is giving rise to rumors in the SPD.    The latest one: If Scharping fails at the October Bundestag  elections, Gerhard Schroeder, who will remain in Lower Saxony,  wants to become party chairman. Lafontaine, who wants to win a  Bundestag seat, is then to become parliamentary group chairman  and leader of the opposition. Commentary from the SPD  leadership: "Even if the two were planning such a thing, they  will then fight in the chair like hell." Critics say that  Schroeder and Lafontaine have only one thing in common: "Each  of them thinks he is the greatest."    Scharping, who is said to be an "extremely hard worker" even  by his critics, is meanwhile counting on the elections in  Saxony-Anhalt on 26 June. There the SPD quite rightly expects  to win a clear victory over the Bonn coalition parties.</p>

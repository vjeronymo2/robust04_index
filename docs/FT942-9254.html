			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Factoring's unsung role for exporters - An overdraft is not the only option for companies trading overseas Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, gave factoring a generous 'plug' at a dinner in London last week. Yet for all the publicity which this form of finance now receives, a surprising number of businesses, notably exporters, remain ignorant of its charms. Around 85 per cent of UK exports are still financed by the traditional bank overdraft, despite the advantages of using factoring companies - which buy debts in return for an immediate cash payment, take over debtor records and provide a collection service for clients. Overdrafts, indeed, are seldom used effectively to finance overseas trade. Most banks seek security for loans, often using a company's assets - including its trade debts - to support any overdraft. Secured by a floating charge, they will usually lend up to 60 per cent of the value of a current UK receivable, but they still will not lend anything against the value of foreign trade debts. This leads to the absurd situation where a company might be given no credit on the back of an export sale to, say, a leading multinational conglomerate  -but would be advanced up to 60 per cent of the value of a sale to a small corner shop. Some of the clearing banks admittedly have export finance schemes using credit insurance on the overseas buyers as security. Unfortunately, the number of these schemes has fallen from 14 to five over the last two years, although National Westminster Bank has recently re-entered this market. As many factoring companies are owned by large financial institutions, it is perhaps surprising that the wide variety of services provided by factors are not adopted by the clearing banks for their export finance schemes. There are, of course, deeply rooted reasons why some exporters are reluctant to take advantage of factoring companies. Undoubtedly the old image of factors as 'lenders of last resort' haunts factoring companies. Suppliers are sometimes concerned that overseas buyers might consider the exporter to be in financial difficulties if export debts are factored. It is an attitude which needs to be revised. The factors now provide highly competitive financing rates linked with fast information reporting systems and also keep exporters informed of payments received and outstanding debtor values. Factoring is also considered expensive by exporters, but they seldom take the various savings into account. For instance, there is less need to send out invoice reminders to customers and there is less requirement for internal credit control and bookkeeping. There are no legal costs in collecting bad debts. Experience shows that companies using factors obtain payment faster than when traditional payment methods are used, because debts can be paid to an associate factor in the buyer's country. A company with a turnover of Pounds 2m can expect to save about Pounds 25,000 in costs or 1.25 per cent of turnover in a year. Factors can finance a company's total debts or sometimes selected invoices. Factoring, though, is not suitable for all companies and exporters must assess their specific financing requirements. Take Company A, which exports 90 per cent of its Pounds 2m turnover to multinational companies in overseas markets. The company receives payments on average within 60 days from the date of despatch, for which it requires working capital of Pounds 300,000. The company had an overdraft facility of Pounds 50,000 and funded the balance of its working capital need from reserves, causing pressure on its liquidity. The company's bank would not increase the overdraft because of the large proportion of overseas debts. Company A had two options: reduce export turnover or find an alternative source of finance. By turning to a factor the company was granted a facility covering 85 per cent of its debtor book with a limit of Pounds 240,000. The factor provided finance and a debt collection service in the buyer's country - an altogether more efficient way of receiving and collecting payment. Overseas debtor days were reduced from 60 to 45, reducing interest charges and increasing working capital. The interest rates charged by the bank and the factor were the same although the factoring costs were 1.5 per cent of turnover. This cost was offset not only by the reduction in the interest bill but also by greater use of working capital. Company B, which exports 60 per cent of its Pounds 5m turnover and sells mainly to the Middle and Far East markets, required additional funding to complete a series of contracts. The company sold mainly on letter of credit terms with a credit period of 60 days and needed its bankers to confirm both the letters of credit and provide funding. Although the company had a small overdraft facility, the bank was happy to extend facilities based on the large value of work in progress and the company's assets. The company had considered factoring but found it was not appropriate because of the large volume of letters of credit received and the small volume of open account business. The lesson is that exporters should seek the most appropriate financing arrangements for trading overseas; and an overdraft should not be considered the only solution.

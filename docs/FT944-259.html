			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Labour demands sacking of Eggar Labour yesterday demanded the dismissal of Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, for his failure to act when British Gas decided to cut its annual budget for checking leaks from Pounds 9m to Pounds 1m. Mr Nigel Griffiths, shadow consumer minister, accused Mr Eggar of knowing nothing about the possible threat to public safety until it was highlighted by the media. Mr Eggar said yesterday he was 'determined that high standards of safety' would be maintained. British Gas, meanwhile, committed itself to widespread consultation with the safety authorities and other interested parties before introducing new practices for leak detection. Transco, the company's pipeline subsidiary, will consult with employees, the Health and Safety Executive, the Gas Consumers' Council and the industry watchdog Ofgas before making the changes, scheduled for next spring.</p>

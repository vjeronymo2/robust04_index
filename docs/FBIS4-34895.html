			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, 23 Jun (AE) -- PT [Workers Party]  presidential candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and German  businessmen will hold a working breakfast on 24 June. Lula will  tell them that he intends to finance his economic program  through the creation of solidarity funds.    Although the Lula administration will seek agreement with  the  richest sectors of Brazilian society, it will also tax large  fortunes by regulating existing constitutional article. For  Lula, who arrived in Bonn this evening, this is not a new  measure; it is in practice in several European countries,  including Germany and France.    One of the main concerns of the German reporters who met  with  Lula today was how an eventual PT administration will treat  foreign investments. "I want investments that will produce  results in the social field. Germany is a good example of  this," Lula said. Nearly all German investments in Brazil are in  the productive sector.    Today in Mainz, Lula met with Rudolf Sharping, president of  the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), with whom he  discussed the foreign debt. PT government platform coordinator  Marco Aurelio Garcia calmed Sharping by saying: "The PT  criticizes the foreign debt agreement signed by the Brazilian  Government, but will respect it as long as it does not affect  our exchange reserves or our government program financing." The  PT government program requires funds to fight unemployment and  misery, and to help education and the land distribution problem.    Even though the PT belongs to Socialist International, it is  contacting the European Social Democratic parties which are  traditionally closer to the PDT [Democratic Labor Party] of  Leonel Brizola and the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party]  of Fernando Henrique Cardoso. SPD President Rudolf Sharping was  unable to explain quite why his party financed the trip of the  PT candidate and his delegation to Europe. Sharping merely said  the SPD is open to contacts with other Brazilian political  parties. Lula said that although the PT does not belong to the  Socialist International, it has always maintained good relations  with the German SPD and other European social democratic parties  which are concerned with social aspects.</p>

			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Letter: Lessons not to be ignored on corporate venturing Sir, Christopher Lorenz (Management, July 2) highlights the renewed interest in corporate venturing. This is supported by the significant number of companies which, because of our research during the 1980s into new business development, have been approaching us. It is important that many of the lessons learned from those earlier, often unsuccessful, attempts are not neglected. The research pointed to a number of issues which need to be addressed. In particular, it appears important to adopt evaluation, planning and control approaches more appropriate to the special features of innovative, than of mature, mainstream businesses. Careful attention to marketing must be ensured from the initiation of any new venture as against assuming a technology or product-based stance. There must also be clear responsibility at a senior level for venturing activities, which should be considered as an integral component of the strategic development of the company. And venturing activities must work effectively with the major functions while at the same time being insulated from the operational requirements of the firm.

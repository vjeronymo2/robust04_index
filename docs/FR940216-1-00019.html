			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Existing paragraph (c) would be revised and combined with existing paragraph (d) and redesignated as paragraph (b). The paragraph would also include a corollary addition of the words ``disturbing, damaging, excavating, digging, removing, transporting, possessing, buying, selling, bartering, or offering to buy, sell, or barter any plant that is classified as a threatened, endangered, or sensitive species.'' This revision would replace the terms ``rare'' and ``unique'' with the term ``sensitive'' in order to reflect a change in agency terminology since adoption of the current rule (Forest Service Manual, section 2670.5). Plants that once were identified as ``rare'' or ``unique'' have been placed on ``sensitive'' plant lists established and maintained by each Regional Office of the Forest Service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Existing paragraph (e) would be redesignated as paragraph (d) and revised by adding the words ``without permission'' to remove an ambiguity in the current rule. The proposed rule would make clear that employees and contractors may be permitted to occupy Forest Service buildings and offices after closing hours. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Existing paragraph (f) would be revised for clarity and redesignated as paragraph (e). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Existing paragraphs (g), (h), and (i) would be combined and revised for clarity and redesignated as new paragraph (c). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Four new provisions are proposed for this section. A new paragraph (f) would prohibit the possession, duplication, or use of Forest Service locks and keys without authorization. All Forest Service regions are experiencing significant problems with the unauthorized use of these items. The only remedy currently available is under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 641, which requires the agency to prove that an actual theft of government property has occurred. These kinds of cases can best be handled as misdemeanors rather than as felonies; therefore, inclusion in part 261 of a prohibition on unauthorized possession, duplication, and use of Forest Service locks and keys is appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> New paragraph (g) and (h) are proposed to parallel, as misdemeanors, a relatively new computer fraud law found at 18 U.S.C. 1030. The statute requires that unauthorized access must ``affect the use of the government's operation *&blank;*&blank;* of a computer.'' The statute also did not provide for prosecution under a misdemeanor charge. The addition of paragraphs (g) and (h) in part 261 would allow the agency to initiate action where there has been unauthorized use regardless of the effect of the use on the government's operation of a computer, and would provide a means for prosecution of such use as a misdemeanor. The definition of ``computer'' proposed for inclusion in &sect;261.2 is the same as in 18 U.S.C. 1030. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The addition of paragraph (i) would provide a prohibition against performing an action or failing to perform an action in violation of any restrictive covenants or deed reservations associated with scenic easements. There are many instances when there are blatant, but minor, violations of a scenic easement (e.g. installation of signs, use of unauthorized paint colors, etc.) which can be resolved more efficiently through the issuance of a citation rather than through the initiation of a lawsuit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, new paragraph (j) is proposed to make it clear that removal of minerals or mineral materials from the National Forest System is prohibited unless done in compliance with laws and regulations. To be in compliance, a person may need to obtain an approved plan of operations or operating plan in accordance with 36 CFR part 228, subparts A, C, or E, 36 CFR part 292, subpart D, or a permit or lease issued by the Department of the Interior in accordance with 43 CFR chapter II, subchapter C. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No other revisions are proposed to this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 261.10&blank;Occupancy and Use <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The prohibitions in this section relate to occupancy and use of the National Forest System by persons or entities other than the Forest Service. The introductory text immediately following the heading would be revised to include the same language as proposed for &sect;261.9 for the reasons outlined in that section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (b) would be revised for clarity to include ``residing upon'' the National Forest System as a prohibited act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (c) would be revised to add the words ``leasing,'' ``merchandise,'' ``equipment,'' and ``renting'' to update the existing rule on activities prohibited without authorization. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (d) would be revised to remove the prohibition against the discharge of a firearm across or on a Forest development road unless ``any person or property is exposed to injury or damage *&blank;*&blank;*.'' The blanket prohibition against any discharge has created a significant problem in several Forest Service regions as a ``Forest development road'' includes closed roads, traffic service level ``D'' roads, and other similar roads that have little or no vehicular use. Because of the limited traffic, hunting along these roads is not considered to be a safety problem. The proposed revision would add a prohibition against the discharge of a firearm from a vehicle and then make clear that the current prohibition against discharging a firearm ``in any manner or place whereby any person or property is exposed to injury or damage as a result of such discharge or use,'' applies to any location in the National Forest System. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragrph (k) would be revised to change the term ``operating plan'' or ``plan of operations.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the preceding amendments, six new provisions are proposed for this section. A new paragraph (n) would prohibit the payment of any ``product, permit, fee or service'' by a check backed by insufficient funds. Several Assistant United States Attorneys have recommended this addition, as the only current remedy for such practices is to pursue them through State courts, which has not been efficient. There have been documented instances where the same user of a group-fee area or campsite, knowing that the agency is unable to initiate an effective collection action, has written bad checks two and sometimes three years in a row. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A new paragraph (o) would prohibit anyone from charging or collecting fees from persons using the National Forest System, unless the charge or collection is permitted by Federal law, regulation, or special use authorization. In the past few years, there have been an increasing number of cases where private individuals were successful in obtaining ``payments'' from unsuspecting forest users for such things as rafting, using four-wheel-drive roads, and walking across areas under special use authorization, none of which required payment of a fee. This rule is needed to protect the public from unlawful fees by providing a means for prosecuting those engaging in such schemes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

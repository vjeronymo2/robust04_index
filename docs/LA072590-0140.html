			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PBS WILL BACK PRODUCERS ON OBSCENITY OATH;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: NETWORK EXECUTIVES SAY THEY WOULD NOT EXPECT PROGRAM SUPPLIERS TO  SIGN NEA PLEDGE.  </P> <P> Top executives at the Public Broadcasting Service on Tuesday entered the fray  over the "indecency oath" that Congress has imposed on recipients of funding  from the National Endowment for the Arts, saying that PBS would "fully support"  any producer who refused to sign such an oath.  </P> <P> "I would be very surprised if our producers would sign that," Neil Mahrer, PBS  executive vice president and chief operating officer, told a news conference at  the Century Plaza hotel.  </P> <P> Producers who lost or risked NEA funding by refusing to sign would receive the  full support of PBS, said programming chief Jennifer Lawson. The noncommercial  network might attempt to provide funding to producers who sacrifice grants by  taking a stand, but it was more likely to help them look for alternative  sources of revenue, she said.  </P> <P> "It's difficult to make promises, in that we are always scrambling for  funding," Lawson told the gathering of TV critics and writers here for meetings  with network and cable officials about the fall season. "But I think we would  do all that we could to provide the moral support if not the financial  support."  </P> <P> Still, Lawson and Mahrer stopped short of actually urging producers to refuse  to sign an oath, or of saying that PBS would refuse programming made after an  anti-obscenity pledge was signed.  </P> <P> "This may sound like a cop-out, but the truth is that the Public Broadcasting  Service does not produce any of its own programming," Mahrer said. "Our  producers are the ones who would make a decision whether or not to sign."  </P> <P> Currently, six public-television series -- "Live From Lincoln Center,"  "American Masters," "Great Performances," "Point of View," "Alive from Off  Center" and "American Playhouse" -- receive a total of approximately $7 million  in NEA funding each year.  </P> <P> None of those producers has yet been affected by the "decency standards"  advocated by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and other conservatives, but many fear  that their work will be constrained in the future, Lawson said.  </P> <P> "We are concerned about the kind of chill factor, a chilling effect on  creativity" that might occur should the guidelines and oath be continued beyond  the current fiscal year, as Congress is considering, Lawson said.  </P> <P> She cited as an example a documentary recently broadcast on "Point of View,"  called "Metamorphosis: Man Into Woman," about a person going through a sex  change. That program might not receive funding were the NEA to restrict its  support, and producers, fearing a withdrawal of money, might not even attempt  to produce such programs, she said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the assembled reporters also were told Tuesday that the Corporation  for Public Broadcasting will fund or partially fund six new series, including  an educational game show for children based on the popular computer game,  "Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?"  </P> <P> Dan Marbury, director of the corporation's Television Program Fund, said that  the organization would spend $4.1 million on the programs, which are planned  for prime-time broadcast in 1991 and 1992.  </P> <P> The first new series to air will likely be "Carmen Sandiego," which is designed  to teach children about geography in a game-show format and is scheduled to run  for 26 weeks in 1991. (The "Carmen Sandiego" computer game also has been  licensed by DIC Enterprises for development as a children's cartoon series.)  </P> <P> "The History of Baseball," to be produced by public station WETA in Washington,  D.C., will focus on aspects of the game that are typically ignored, said  Lawson, such as discrimination against women and blacks, and the gradual  incorporation of the nation's melting pot population into the game as fans and  players.  </P> <P> "Cracking the Code" is a biology series consisting of eight 60-minute programs,  with "Nova" executive producer Paula Apsell in charge of production.  </P> <P> "The Other Side of the News," scheduled for 1991, will be produced by pioneer  television news producer Fred W. Friendly and Columbia University Seminars on  Mass Media and Society. The nine-part series is designed to tell the story  behind gathering the news and to offer criticism.  </P> <P> "The '90s," a series designed to help vieweres question traditional news  perspectives and find alternative ways to get information about the world, is  the only one of the new series that might run later than prime time, said  Lawson. The show might be better suited to late night, she said, because it  will deal with fairly controversial topics.  </P> <P> Finally, "Critical Condition" is an eight-part series on the future of medical  science, to be produced by WETA and WNET in New York.  </P></p>

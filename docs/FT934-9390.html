			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Warning to Europe on digital revolution EUROPE risks being left behind North America and the Asia Pacific region in the 'communications revolution' because of poor foresight and co-ordination, according to the president of a leading data networking company. Mr Eric Benhamou, president of 3Com, based in California, said that 'insufficient public awareness about Europe's plan for a superdigital highway' - an advanced, high-volume communications network for data, image and voice - was jeopardising its economic potential. Delivering the London Business School's annual Governors' Lecture, sponsored by the FT, Mr Benhamou contrasted the low profile of European projects with their high status in competing regions. 'The US has NII, Canada has the Canarie project, Singapore has IT2000, Japan has its 2015 ISDN milestone, but there is no direct equivalent in Europe.' Despite 'exciting' networking projects, such as SuperJanet, to interconnect universities and research institutions, Europe lacked the strategic vision of the US and the Far East, he said.</p>

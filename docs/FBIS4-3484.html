			<p>BFN     [Text] During his inspection of Tianjin, Comrade Wan Li  pointed out that reform and opening up are the motivation to  ceaselessly push our undertakings forward and we are allowed to  boldly have a try to and give free reins to implement the ideas  suiting the "three-conducive" standards as put forward by  Comrade Xiaoping. The policies on reform and opening up will  not be shaken for 100 years.    Accompanied by Gao Dezhan, secretary of the Tianjin  Municipal  party committee; Zhang Lichang, mayor of the municipality; Zheng  Zhiying, standing committee member and secretary general of the  municipal party committee; and Ye Disheng, vice mayor of the  municipality, Comrade Wan Li inspected the bonded area of  Tianjin harbor, the Tianjin economic and technological  development zone, and the Tianjin steel tube company, from 9 to  10 April. Comrade Wan Li, at the age of 78 years, zestfully  visited some enterprises, including the Aojin electric cable  corporation and the Motorola electronics corporation; and heard  the work reports of the bonded area, the development zone, and  the steel tube company.    After hearing the reports, Comrade Wan Li pointed out: I am  very glad to see Tianjin's vigorous progress in reform, opening  up, and economic construction. Your such great achievements  made through the efforts to develop the development zone in the  past 10 years and the bonded area in the past three years fully  prove the gigantic power of reform and opening up. At present,  so long as we unswervingly work in accordance with the party  Central Committee's 20-character policy on "grasping favorable  opportunities, deepening reform, expanding the scale of opening  up, promoting development, and maintaining stability," will we  be able to make greater achievements.    During the inspection, Comrade Wan Li especially stressed  the  importance of science and technology and skilled persons. He  said: Things should be done by the people. In conducting reform  and opening to the outside world, we need a large number of  specialized talents with the knowledge of technologies,  management, and foreign languages. Open cities must open  themselves to the outside world. We should learn foreign  languages since childhood. Capable of foreign languages, our  younger generation will better assimilate the advanced and  scientific things in the world and spread the excellent culture  of our Chinese nation to the outside world. At the Motorola  corporation, Comrade Wan Li saw that the world advanced  production line was operating at a highly-clean, sealed  workshop. He was very glad to know that last year, this  corporation generated 820 million yuan in output value and 130  million yuan of profits and taxes. He said: Science and  technology are the primary productive forces. This is the truth.  Advanced sciences and techniques can produce gigantic  productive forces. Our aim to conduct joint investment and  bring in techniques, capital, and skilled persons is to bring in  the most advanced techniques and managerial skills. We cannot  bring in the things that have been eliminated by others.</p>

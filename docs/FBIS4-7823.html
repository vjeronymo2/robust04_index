			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Enes Murtovic from Gorazde] </F>   [Text] The siren sounding general danger (?shows) that  there is no peace in Gorazde again today. The chetniks [words  indistinct] are shelling civilian areas and the defense lines.  The highest caliber shells are again destroying the Gorazde  region that borders Foca, Cajnice, and Rogatica. In the course  of the day, several howitzer shells landed on the town. Even  though the residents of Gorazde are in shelters all the time,  the casualty figures are nevertheless [passage indistinct] (?41)  women and old men. [words indistinct] arrival of General  Michael Rose, commander of the UN forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina,  separated the chetniks from their (?deadly) weapons for only a  moment. As we send this report, explosions are once again being  heard in the town's suburbs. The chetniks are also attacking  the town itself.    The [word indistinct] and the suffering of the population in  the protected zone of Gorazde is continuing before the eyes of  the international community, which again is not taking [word  indistinct] measures to stop the latest offensive by the  chetniks.    This is Enes Murtovic reporting for Radio and Television  Bosnia- Herzegovina from the Press Center of the Gorazde region.</p>

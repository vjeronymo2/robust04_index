			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OFFERING COMPASSION TO THE VICTIMS OF AIDS  </P> <P> It's not funny anymore. Not that they ever were. I am referring to the  tabloids. I have just read your story, "Breaking the Silence," about the Glaser  family and the incredible challenge brought to them by AIDS (Aug. 25). They  have spoken with courage to Janet Huck of The Times because the tabloids are  preparing an onslaught of cruelty against them, and they are attempting through  honesty and responsible reporting to protect themselves.  </P> <P> The major tabloid has changed its television advertising. No longer does a  booming baritone voice-over seriously inform us that "inquiring minds want to  know." Instead, a lighter-hearted scene of semiattractive readers is shown  giggling over the contents of the paper, and the voice-over has considerably  lightened up. But it's not funny. It never has been true, and it's not funny,  either.  </P> <P> I think the tabloids are a success based upon jealousy and stupidity. Jealousy  because only a jealous person could possibly be pleased to read distorted  accounts of the lives of others who seem to be happy, or "have it all," or are  living with the blessing of the double-edged sword of fame. Stupidity because  those who buy it know it isn't true, but fork over the 50 cents anyway. That's  stupid. That's jealous. That's inexcusable.  </P> <P> The tabloid in question prints stories full of lies and distortion based upon  personal tragedy and misunderstanding. It is the National Enquirer. Do not  support it. DO NOT BUY IT. DO NOT BUY IT EVER AGAIN. Instead, embrace the  Glaser family, and others like them who are not famous. Love and support them,  and give them the respect and privacy they deserve.  </P> <P> Fifty cents sent to Elizabeth Glaser's Pediatric AIDS Foundation, instead of  wasted on such terrible trash will make a difference -- now and in the future.  Send it, instead of spending it, to Elizabeth's Pediatric AIDS Foundation. Send  it -- don't spend it. Send it if you were going to buy the tabloid. Send it  even if you weren't. I will.  </P> <P> KATE JACKSON  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KILLING IN CAMBODIA: A TALE OF TWO DECADES  </P> <P> Cambodian Buddhists believe that dead souls not given a proper burial are  condemned to wander restlessly in a nether world, unable to enter another body  for reincarnation. Among the 500,000 dead in the civil war from 1970-75 and the  1 million killed or worked to death by the Khmer Rouge from 1975-79, few were  accorded the proper rites. This deeply troubles the Cambodian spirit.  </P> <P> The survivors themselves are in limbo. For 10 years, since January, 1979, they  have been ruled by Heng Samrin and Hun Sen, two former mid-level Khmer Rouge  officials who were placed in power when the Vietnamese invasion toppled Pol Pot  and the Khmer Rouge.  </P> <P> Invasion liberated the country from genocidal tyranny but put state power in  the hands of leaders who owed their survival to Vietnam.  </P> <P> For centuries the more powerful states of Vietnam to the east and Thailand to  the west have threatened to swallow Cambodia. When the Vietnamese did arrive in  1979 the situation was ambiguous: Vietnamese military and political support was  essential to protect the fledgling People's Republic of Kampuchea, as the  country is known today, from the return of the Khmer Rouge. The Khmer Rouge was  rebuilt and rearmed with military assistance from China and Thailand, and  diplomatic support from much of the world including the United States.  </P> <P> The 7 million Cambodians who remain in their country have had to accept  occupation by their traditional enemy, Vietnam, as the lesser evil compared  with the return of the Khmer Rouge. For most of the last 10 years the  international community has been content to condemn Cambodians to this awful  choice.  </P> <P> For nine of those years I have been traveling back and forth to Cambodia as a  relief worker, attempting to provide humanitarian assistance in an atmosphere  of continued anxiety, conflict and polarization. From the beginning of my  involvement in 1980, the policy of the United States -- diplomatic backing for  the Chinese and Thai policy of full support to the Khmer Rouge as the strongest  resistance force to the Vietnamese occupation -- struck me as immoral  Realpolitik of the most cynical sort.  </P> <P> I have heard many stories of the Pol Pot period -- of a son whose father died  in his arms, of a young woman whose parents and 12 siblings were killed. In  1980 such stories poured out of Cambodians, more to each other than to outside  relief workers. Ten years later, the emotions are not as raw and vivid, but the  healing has been incomplete.  </P> <P> A decade ago exhausted and malnourished survivors of the Khmer Rouge genocide  began to trek across Cambodia to return to their villages and search for  missing relatives. When they reached their villages they often found nothing  left: homes damaged or destroyed, no trace of family and friends, food stocks  looted or burned. Fighting between the Vietnamese and Khmer Rouge troops still  swirled around them. Recapture by the Khmer Rouge meant instant death or, at  best, a forced march west with the retreating soldiers.  </P> <P> Once the fighting passed, peasants devoted any remaining energy to scavenging  for food and constructing shelter for their families. Others headed for Phnom  Penh, the capital that became a ghost town under the Khmer Rouge and was slowly  being repopulated.  </P> <P> Today Phnom Penh has a population of 800,000. It has the surface feel of a city  -- bustling markets, restaurants, cinemas, shops and a tame version of rush  hour. But at night, even before the 10 p.m. curfew, the city seems to suffer  absence, as quiet as a village.  </P> <P> Recovery from the 1979 famine was at first rapid; it has since slowed. The  Vietnamese-backed government, unrecognized by all but the Soviet bloc and  India, has faced an embargo on trade and aid imposed by Asian neighbors and  Western countries. Cambodia has reached bare self-sufficiency in food  production but even minor problems with drought or floods puts lives in  jeopardy. In sectors dependent on outside investment -- industry, transport,  communications and sanitation -- progress has been minimal. Just to get back to  where it was in the '60s, much less to develop, Cambodia needs massive outside  investment. This can only come when the political stalemate is resolved. In the  meantime, the embargo on humanitarian aid punishes the poor of Cambodia.  </P> <P> Politically, the current government has gained in stature following the series  of meetings between Prime Minister Hun Sen and Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the  nation's former leader. Sihanouk's name still evokes, after decades of war and  revolution, what Cambodians remember as the halcyon days when the country was  whole. Cambodians now welcome government tolerance of the small private sector  and recent announcements that collectivization of agricultural land will no  longer be encouraged.  </P> <P> But there is dissatisfaction with the continued dependence on Vietnam. The  human-rights record of the government has been condemned by Amnesty  International and other such organizations that deplore the detention of  political prisoners without trial and the use of civilian labor on military  works projects near the Thai-Cambodian border, projects that have resulted in  deaths from land mines and malaria.  </P> <P> The dialogues between Hun Sen and Sihanouk are the most concrete sign of hope  that a settlement is possible in 1989. The initiatives of Soviet leader Mikhail  S. Gorbachev, to reduce tensions with the West by cutting Soviet commitments to  client states in regions of superpower tension, also help.  </P> <P> The Vietnamese, feeling Soviet pressure and desperate for capitalist investment  in their own economy, have begun significant troop withdrawals from Cambodia,  with a pledge to withdraw fully by 1990. The Soviet dialogue with China, main  backers of the Khmer Rouge, hold further promise.  </P> <P> At the United Nations, where the Khmer Rouge holds Cambodia's seat, the General  Assembly, for the first time since 1979, passed a resolution dealing with  Cambodia that included a veiled condemnation of the genocide when the Khmer  Rouge were in power.  </P> <P> But these diplomatic efforts, as significant as they are, cannot by themselves  banish the Khmer Rouge. This monstrous group, revived and sustained since 1979  as the means to drive the Vietnamese out of Cambodia, refuses to leave the  scene now that its task is nearly done. So as the Vietnamese troops withdraw,  Khmer Rouge begins to fill the vacuum, promising revenge on all those who dared  to collaborate with the Vietnamese to ensure their own survival.  </P> <P> Without an immediate halt to military and political support for the Khmer Rouge  from China and Thailand -- a policy heretofore aided and abetted by the United  States -- the talk of peace and U.N.-supervised elections and quadripartite  governments is irrelevant and even dangerous. A strengthened Khmer Rouge has  the potential power to disrupt any settlement, even if the group is nominally  made a part of it.  </P> <P> Now, State Department sources emphasize U.S. distance from the Khmer Rouge.  During his confirmation hearings, Secretary of State James A. Baker III  promised, "The United States will continue to work for a new Cambodia, free of  both Vietnamese occupation and the Khmer Rouge."  </P> <P> To say Cambodia could become another Lebanon, another Mozambique or another  Nicaragua does not do justice to Cambodia. Cambodia, where the perpetrators  have changed but violence has been the norm for 20 years, begs no comparison.  Cambodians, the dead and the living, beg only, finally, for peace.  </P></p>

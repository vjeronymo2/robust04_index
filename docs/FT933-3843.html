			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Better a sympathetic encounter while walking in wine country Sir, Having just read Nigel Buxton's informative and useful new book, Walking in Wine Country, I was mystified by Giles MacDonogh's review (Food &amp; Drink: 'Lo's life and times', September 4). If Nigel Buxton met with much friendliness on his walks, regardless of whether or not he immediately disclosed that he was a writer, in contrast to Mr MacDonogh's experiences, I fear Mr MacDonogh must face the possibility that he may appear less pleasant and sympathetic to meet on such occasions than Mr Buxton. I hope therefore that Mr Buxton will take more walks in wine country for our benefit and I suggest that Mr MacDonogh stay in his car when next in those parts. Michael Cornish, 28 Stockwell Park Road, London SW9 0AJ</p>

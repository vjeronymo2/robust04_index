			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Observer: Market forces If Mohammed won't move to the mountain, then the mountain must shift instead. Dissatisfied with the number of business types willing to trek across London to St James's Square, the Royal Institute of International Affairs is next Monday heading east, to get nearer its putative corporate audience. At the Bank of England's first 'Chatham House in the City' meeting, the speaker will be Celso Amorim, foreign minister of Brazil, a country the institute sees as an 'emerging market'. Admission is 'by ticket only' and would-be participants were supposed to apply by July 4. As of yesterday, however, the lecture was far from being a sell-out. Presumably because, as the old Brazilian adage has it, 'Brazil is the land of the future - and always will be'.</p>

			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AZTECS LOSE CENTER DOW FOR SEASON  </P> <P> San Diego State center Marty Dow will undergo surgery this afternoon for a  partially torn tendon in his right foot and ankle and be lost to the team for  the remainder of the season, team physician Dr. Peter Wile said Monday.  </P> <P> Dow's foot has been sore for nearly two months, and Wile said Dow was X-rayed  before the team left for a trip to Utah Jan. 31. The test showed a partial tear  in the tendon, and then Dow aggravated it Feb. 3 at Utah when he was stepped on  by teammate Vern Thompson.  </P> <P> "There was no question he was going to have surgery at the end of the season,"  Wile said. "The last injury and the intense pain just forced our hand."  </P> <P> The first prescription for Dow, who has had a couple of cortisone shots for the  foot this season, was several days of rest. But Wile said Dow went to SDSU  trainer Mark Haines late last week and said the foot wasn't getting any better.  </P> <P> "He basically said he was in enough pain that he didn't want to wait until the  end of the season," Wile said. "In the past, it's always gotten better. But  since the recent aggravation, he has been in constant pain."  </P> <P> Dow, a 7-foot-1 junior, was unavailable for comment. He was averaging 12 points  and six rebounds a game and, until Saturday's victory over U.S. International  University, was one of just two Aztecs to start every game this season. Shawn  Jamison is the other.  </P> <P> "(Marty) is not a guy who will whimper over a minor pain," SDSU Coach Jim  Brandenburg said. "He's been in uncomfortable pain since the injury happened a  week ago Saturday."  </P> <P> Wile said today's surgery should take about 45 minutes and that the success  rate for this type of surgery is "in the high 90% range." According to Wile,  Dow will be in a cast for about six weeks, after which he can start to  rehabilitate. But he said it would be a minimum of two-and-a-half to three  months before Dow can jump or run hard.  </P> <P> If everything goes according to schedule, Wile said, Dow should be able to  resume playing basketball this summer and be ready for the start of SDSU  basketball practice next fall.  </P> <P> Jamison, a 6-8 forward, will now be asked to swing over to center at times,  along with 6-11 Neal Steinly. Jamison is SDSU's leading scorer at 16 points a  game. Steinly is averaging just 1.2 points and six minutes a game. Other than  Jamison and Steinly, the Aztecs have nobody taller than 6-6 on their roster.  They also have only nine players on their roster for the remainder of the  season -- and just seven were on the floor by the end of Monday's practice.  Point guard Rodney Jones is recovering from a sprained ankle and his practice  time has been limited during the past week, and reserve guard Kevin Honaker  missed practice Monday with a strained calf, suffered running across a parking  lot Sunday.  </P> <P> "We have to start working hard and adjusting our player rotation, chemistry and  shot distribution," Brandenburg said.  </P> <P> Steinly started at center against USIU Saturday, but Brandenburg could also go  with a smaller lineup consisting of Jamison at center and swingman Michael  Hudson (6-5) at forward. Dow's injury will also mean more playing time for  Eeric White (6-6).  </P> <P> "We can't sustain a whole game with Steinly at center, and we can't sustain a  whole game with Jamison at center," Brandenburg said. "No matter how we start,  Steinly, Jamison and White have to come through on occasion. And Hudson is a  physical player, so he will have to step inside.  </P> <P> "It's not a great situation for us, but if we respond positively I think we can  get some things done."  </P></p>

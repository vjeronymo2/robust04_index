			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Pit closure plans are speeded up BRITISH COAL yesterday accelerated its contraction programme, saying that it wants talks with unions about the Littleton colliery in Staffordshire, the first of the so-called 19 'core pits' to be threatened with closure. The naming of Littleton with Silverdale, also in Staffordshire, means that six pits have been mentioned this month as candidates for closure or contraction. A seventh, probably Wearmouth in county Durham, is likely to emerge next week when management in north-east England is due to meet unions. British Coal operates 30 pits but is producing far more coal than it can sell. It is expected to close at least 15 of them before privatisation, most in the next four months. The decision by British Coal to seek further talks with unions on Littleton next Monday emphasises the problems in finding markets. Until recently Littleton was considered one of the safest pits. It was given a future even in October last year, when the government announced plans - scaled back after a public outcry - to close 31 others. It was also thought to have been protected because it sells about 40 per cent of its coal to non-power station markets. British Coal told unions yesterday, however, that since April Littleton had lost Pounds 2.9m. UK power station consumption of coal had fallen by 20 per cent this year, even more than had been expected. Silverdale, which employs 398 miners, has lost Pounds 5.6m. Management will meet leaders there on Friday. The naming of Silverdale and Littleton for further talks does not necessarily mean they will close. The other, less likely, possibility is significant redundancies. The three pits where British Coal has already held pithead reviews in this final pre-privatisation round have been told of closure plans. They are Frickley and Bentley in Yorkshire and Calverton in Nottinghamshire. Miners at the other named pit, Hatfield in South Yorkshire, will be told of its prospects on Friday. Miners at most of the pits are being offered up to Pounds 44,000 to accept redundancy but both the National Union of Mineworkers and the Union of Democratic Mineworkers are urging members to fight closures. The closure programme can take up to nine months if miners decide to appeal, but such long delays are unusual. A test of miners' resolve will be provided tomorrow when pit workers at Calverton, where the UDM is the majority union, vote on a closures plan.</p>

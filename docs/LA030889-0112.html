			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEFENDANT IN 115 'SKI MASK RAPIST' ATTACKS CONVICTED  </P> <P> George Sanchez, known as the "ski mask rapist," was found guilty Tuesday by a  Superior Court judge of 115 crimes against women in nine Bay Area communities.  </P> <P> The 27-year-old sewage worker faced multiple charges of rape, oral copulation,  assault and burglary. The victims were 26 women, ranging in age from 16 to 83,  from February, 1985, to November, 1987.  </P> <P> Sanchez preyed on women living near churches or church-operated schools,  commiting sexual assaults and stealing jewelry -- which he gave to his wife,  according to testimony.  </P> <P> His wife, Clara, 28, was charged with 13 counts of possessing stolen property.  Sanchez, the father of two, agreed to waive his right to trial on the condition  that charges against his wife be dropped.  </P> <P> Judge Paul R. Teilh reviewed the evidence presented against Sanchez in a  preliminary hearing in September and then found him guilty.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Margo Smith said Sanchez could be sentenced to life in  prison without possibility of parole.  </P></p>

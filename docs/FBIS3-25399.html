			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by ANC President Nelson Mandela, issued by the </F> African National Congress on the SAPA PR Wire Service on 16  February]    [Text] South Africa is today at the crossroads. The way  forward requires vision and balanced leadership which transcends  narrow political interests.    Great progress has been made towards the first democratic  elections on 27 April 1994. Already, parties which have  committed themselves to agreements arising out of multi-party  negotiations are out in the hustings competing for votes in what  has become the most exciting political mobilisation that our  country has ever seen. Such is true democracy.    Yet there are others, steeped in the politics of the past --  the politics of racism, ethnic chauvinism and violence -- who  seek to drown the process in blood. This shall not and cannot be  allowed to continue.    It is necessary that all South Africans unite in a common  endeavour to deal with this danger. We cannot allow the birth of  our society as a united, non-racial and democratic nation to be  held to ransom by captivities of the apartheid past.    Now is the time for all our people -- black and white,  whatever our language or ethnic origins -- to speak with one  voice. The product of the negotiations process must reach its  culmination with the election on 27 April of a new democratic  government based on the will of all the people.    In this regard, the National Working Committee (NWC) of the  ANC [African National Congress] has reviewed the current  situation and reaffirmed the following National Executive  Committee decisions:    Firstly, that the elections on 27 April, 1994 cannot under  any circumstances be postponed.    Secondly, that the integrity and sovereignty of South  Africa,  as defined in the interim constitution, cannot be tampered with.    And thirdly, that measures need to be taken to address the  fears of those who feel left out of the process, either as a  result of misconceptions about what it entails or deliberate  misinformation by those not interested in a genuine resolution  of our problems.    In order to address these issues, the NWC reaffirmed  decisions of the National Executive Committee with regard to the  following matters which have recently been under negotiations:    1. Inclusion in the interim constitution of a constitutional  principle on self-determination, based on the negotiations  conducted with the AVF [Afrikaner National Front] and others; as  well as provisions for a mechanism and process for the  consideration of the issue of a volkstaat [homeland].    2. Provision for voters to cast 2 votes: one each for  national and provincial representatives.    3. Amendment to the interim constitution to address the  following provincial matters    3.1. A constitutional provision for provincial  finances based on agreements reached in negotiations with the  Freedom Alliance;  3.2. A constitutional provision allowing provinces, in  drafting provincial constitutions, to determine their own  legislative and executive structures;  3.3. In order to grant greater security to the  newly-elected democratic provincial governments, amend  provisions of the interim constitution to ensure that powers  presently granted are not substantially diminished when the  constitutional assembly drafts the new constitution; and  3.4. That the democratically-elected provincial  legislatures will decide on names for their provinces, and that,  in the interim constitution, the province of natal can be  renamed kwaZulu/Natal.       Pursuant to these decisions, the ANC will recommend to other  parties and the Transitional Executive Council that, in a matter  of days:     -  the multi-party forum should convene to discuss these  proposed amendments;    -  if the multi-party forum so decides, Parliament should  convene  to adopt amendments agreed upon; and the date for registration  of parties should be extended by a few days.       We wish to reiterate that these measures should only be  implemented if they do not result in the postponement of the 27  April elections.    The ANC reaffirms its readiness to confer with His Majesty  King Zwelethini on issues of concern to the monarch and other  traditional leaders.    We are firmly of the view that these proposals remove all  the  remaining obstacles for the parties which have not yet done so,  to register and become part of the process. We do however  recognise their right not to take part in the democratic  elections. But no one has the right to disrupt the elections. No  one should be allowed to do so.    We wish to issue a solemn reminder to those who think that  they can use force to disrupt the democratic process that the  people of this country have both the capacity and the will to  use their power to defeat these attempts. We call on our people  to exercise maximum vigilance and ready themselves for any such  attempts.    History and future generations would judge the current South  African leadership harshly if we failed to take all the  necessary measures to resolve South Africa's problems peacefully  and through dialogue.  [dated] 16 February, 1994</p>

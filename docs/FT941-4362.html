			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Fimbra chief loses key role in watchdog regime: PIA head to run admissions process Mr Godfrey Jillings, chief executive of Fimbra, the self-regulatory organisation for independent financial advisers, is no longer to manage the process of deciding who should be authorised by the new watchdog for retail financial services. Instead, Ms Colette Bowe, chief executive of the Personal Investment Authority, will run the admissions process herself. 'This is the most important aspect of our work at this time, and I've decided to take personal charge of it,' Ms Bowe said yesterday. She made the decision last week, after the first meeting of the group intended to run the PIA's admissions procedure. Mr Jillings' role in the process had been seen as reassuring independent financial advisers, many of whom will be among the new body's smaller members, that their interests would not be ignored. Many financial advisers have been among the PIA's critics. Mr Jillings' removal is likely to fuel the campaign already being run by the National Federation of Independent Financial Advisers against the impending demise of Fimbra. 'Godfrey is the hero of the IFAs,' one regulator said yesterday. Mr Jillings himself was unavailable for comment. The change in the management of the process comes just three weeks or so after Mr Jillings' role in the admissions project was announced. Work on admissions will still be carried out by staff drawn from Fimbra and Lautro, the self-regulatory organisation for the life insurance industry, but trained to standards set by the PIA. The admissions process will be central in setting the tone of the new regulator, which is intended to bring about a 'step change' in investor protection. The PIA has already warned that firms and individuals approved by existing regulators are not guaranteed acceptance in the new regime. Both Ms Bowe and Mr Joe Palmer, the PIA chairman, faced deeply sceptical questioning from MPs about the admissions arrangements, when they gave evidence to the cross-party treasury committee at the House of Commons last week. MPs expressed grave doubts that applications to join the new regulator could be properly handled, given the likely numbers of candidates and the time available. The PIA expects to have about 6,000 potential members. Application forms are due to be returned by early April. Lautro imposes record Pounds 225,000 penalty, Page 7</p>

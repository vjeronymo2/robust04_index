			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL MEDICAL TO SPIN OFF HILLHAVEN CORP.  </P> <P> National Medical Enterprises, resorting to a popular corporate technique to  boost shareholder value, said Thursday that it plans to spin off its troubled  nursing home subsidiary, the Hillhaven Corp.  </P> <P> The bid to split off the nation's second-largest nursing home chain to existing  NME shareholders "should benefit" them because "the marketplace will evaluate  the long-term care operations separately from our acute and specialty hospital  business after the spinoff," Richard K. Eamer, NME's chairman and chief  executive, said.  </P> <P> The Hillhaven Corp., based in Tacoma, Wash., ranks behind Pasadena-based  Beverly Enterprises. It operates 349 nursing facilities with more than 43,000  beds in 37 states. But belt-tightening in government-funded Medicaid and  Medicare programs have hurt its profitability in recent years. Nursing homes  derive a major portion of their revenue from Medicare.  </P> <P> This new austere financial climate has prompted some health-care firms to spin  off under-performing subsidiaries to increase shareholder values. The stock  distributions involved are ordinarily not taxable to the parent firm or  shareholders, and the transaction can mask the impact of an under-performing  unit on its parent if the unit were sold outright.  </P> <P> "When you spin a company off, it becomes someone else's problem," said Jerry  Balter, a health-care analyst at the San Francisco in vestment house Robertson,  Colman &amp; Stephens. "If (NME) sold (Hillhaven) outright, (it) would probably  have to take a major loss. This way it will have a delayed impact."  </P> <P> NME, which owns and manages 37 acute-care general hospitals with about 6,700  licensed beds, will issue current NME stockholders additional shares in the  newly independent Hillhaven unit.  </P> <P> Although NME's long-term care facilities account for 32% of NME's revenue, they  contribute only 12% of the profits. By comparison, NME's general and specialty  hospitals -- which account for 41% and 27% of revenue, respectively --  contribute 46% and 42% of profits.  </P> <P> NME anticipates that, after shareholder distribution, the common stock of the  Hillhaven Corp. will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and that the  company will have annual revenue of about $1 billion.  </P> <P> NME officials would not say what effect the spinoff might have on NME's bottom  line.  </P> <P> The disclosure of NME's plan, which is subject to government approval, came as  the company announced record earnings for its second quarter ended Nov. 30.  </P> <P> NME said second-quarter revenue rose 16% to $894.6 million and net income  climbed 8% to $47.3 million from a year ago. In a prepared statement, Eamer  attributed the improvements to "the strong performance" of NME's specialty  hospitals.  </P></p>

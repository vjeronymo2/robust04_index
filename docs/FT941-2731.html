			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Rifkind studies plan to lease army vehicles Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, is considering a scheme by which the army could lease lorries and Land Rovers as a means of making savings to the already hard-pressed military budget. The proposal to lease non-fighting vehicles is one of the main options being considered in Front Line First, a Ministry of Defence study of the costs of providing military support services which is near completion. No final decision has been taken on whether to go ahead with the leasing plan. However, the government has not ruled out the possibility of extending the leasing principle to fighting equipment in the longer term. Mr Rifkind floated the idea of leasing lorries in an interview in today's Daily Telegraph. The defence secretary told the paper: 'The armed forces buy huge amounts of vehicles. Nobody in the private sector buys them - they lease. British Rail is now leasing rolling stock - the same amount of capital will go a lot further.' He added: 'Why not do this in the armed forces? The operational commander could not give a dam if he is leasing equipment.' On the principle of extending the principle to fighting equipment, he said: 'I would not rule it out.' Mr Rifkind is under pressure to introduce cost savings in the defence sector following last November's Budget in which the MoD was forced to incur some of the largest cuts of any Whitehall department. In the wake of the Budget ministers emphasised that the spending cuts would not result in a reduction in Britain's front-line forces. The Front Line First studies include proposals to reform a number of other areas of equipment supply. There are plans, for example, to introduce more flexible production lines which could ensure that materials and parts are supplied at a time when they are needed rather than holding huge quantities of goods in reserve.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with reporter Rey Rodriguez from Hanoi </F> by reporter Roberto Cavada from Havana -- live]    [Text] [Cavada] We now have a live and direct link with  Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam, where Cuban Foreign Minister  Roberto Robaina has many activities scheduled. Good morning from  Havana, Rey.    [Rodriguez] Good morning Cavada, and good morning to all  your  Radio Rebelde listeners.    [Cavada] Well, according to PRENSA LATINA, I understand that  the Cuban foreign minister has a heavy agenda there and that he  also met with the Vietnamese Communist Party [VCP] first  secretary. What is the story about this and what other details  can you tell the Cuban people?    [Rodriguez] Well, I have a very few minutes to tell you all  about the foreign minister's acitivities today, that is, on his  second day in Hanoi, capital of Vietnam. But as you said, only  a few minutes ago the Cuban foreign minister was received by VCP  General Secretary Do Muoi. This meeting, which was termed by  Robaina as very fruitful, lasted almost two hours. Do Muoi  expressed interest in the Cuban foreign minister's visit to  seven Asian countries which in addition to Vietnam, includes  Indonesia, Malaysia, Laos, Cambodia, India, and Myanmar [Burma].    Robaina explained to the VCP leader that the objective of  his  tour of these Asian countries is to explain what we are doing in  our country and to listen to many points of view as part of an  offensive being carried out by the Cuban Foreign Ministry. This  offensive began in the Caribbean, then continued in Latin  America and Africa, and now in Asia.    During this meeting Robaina handed over to Do Muoi a message  by Commander in Chief Fidel Castro which conveys the feelings of  [word indistinct] for what the Vietnamese people are doing. Do  Muoi said he is convinced that current difficulties affecting  the island are transitory and that the Cubans will know how to  overcome them. He added that we must be very careful in taking  the right path in this renewal process, especially the one being  carried out by Vietnam, because there are many detours from the  correct path that can jeopardize the sovereignty and  independence of the two countries. He added that in times like  this, the party's ideological nature must be strengthened to  keep it united and sound.    Well, the Cuban foreign minister had previously held several  meetings with the ministers of commerce and agriculture, with  the chairman of the State Committee for Cooperation and  Investments, and in all these meetings both parties have  expressed their interest in strengthening commercial ties in  areas such as biotechnology, construction, agriculture, and  maritime transportation. As I was saying, the importance of  creating joint ventures was stressed, especially in the areas of  construction and of veterinary pharmaceuticals.    I also want to tell you that Robaina held a meeting with  members of political and grassroot organizations here in  Vietnam. During those meetings we obtained an exclusive  interview granted to Rebelde by Ho Duc Viet, secretary of the Ho  Chi Minh Communist Youth Union.    [Begin Ho Duc Viet recording in Vietnamese with simultaneous  translation into Spanish] We are organizing a campaign for a  contribution of 5 million [currency not specified] worth of  school supplies for the Cuban children. Practically all people  have responded favorably to this campaign. In the beginning we  organized this campaign among the youth alone, but then we  extended it to the country's overall population, including the  women, the aged, and state organizations. The campaign has  already concluded. We collected more than $500,000, and all that  money will be used to purchase notebooks, pencils, and other  school utensils for children. We are now waiting for a ship to  transfer these supplies to Cuba. [end recording]    Tomorrow the Cuban foreign minister will grant a news  conference. Present at the news conference will also be the  diplomatic corps accredited to Vietnam. Then Robaina will leave  for the southern part of Vietnam, namely to Ho Chi Minh City  where he will have an intensive working schedule, including a  meeting with the provincial party first secretary. He will also  visit the special industrial processing zone developed in  cooperation with Taiwan. Robaina today also met with the  minister of youth and sports, with the chief of the VCP Central  Committee International Relations Commission. He indeed had an  intensive working schedule, but in all these meetings the  friendship and love between these two peoples have prevailed, in  addition to their traditional ties of friendship.    Thank you, Cavada, and greetings to all listeners of  Rebelde.    [Cavada] Thank you Rey for these expanded details of the  Cuban foreign minister's activities in Vietnam.</p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / International Company News: Profits 'likely to decline 7%' at Japanese groups JAPANESE companies' profits for the business year ending March 31 1993 are likely to drop 7 per cent from year-earlier levels, the Yamaichi Research Institute of Securities and Economics said in a report, Reuter reports from Tokyo. The Yamaichi report covered 673 companies from all industries. Despite lower interest rates and accelerated public works projects, company profits will be hampered by heavy inventory burdens in the first half of 1992-1993. A recovery is unlikely until the second half, the report said. But the surveyed companies' current profits should rebound the following year, rising 11.6 per cent from year-ago levels, the report said.</p>

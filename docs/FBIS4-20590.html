Recent  X-ray and magnetic susceptibility studies[.sup]1,2[/]) show  that the system is more complex.    From powder X-ray diffraction the lattice constants of  ErRh[.sub]3[/][.sup]11[/]B[.sub]2[/] were determined to  be a = 5,3547(3) Angstrom; b = 9,2824(5) Angstrom; c = 3,1017(2)  Angstrom and _b_ = 90,893(5) Angstrom.[.sup]2[/] X-ray  oscillation film technique observations on a single crystal of  ErRh[.sub]3[/]B[.sub]2[/] show a superstructure with a six  doubling of the c-axis.[.sup]1[/]    Magnetization measurements show considerable anisotropy. At  T[.sub]N[/] = 27 K, the data indicates ferromagnetic order  with the spins directed parallel to the c-axis. However, the  magnetization curve shows a maximum at 27 K. The magnetization  decreases on further cooling and ends up at a value of  75% of  it's maximum value. In order to investigate both the crystal and  the magnetic structure, initial investigations of  ErRh[.sub]3[/][.sup]11[/]B[.sub]2[/] has been performed  on a four-circle neutron diffractometer using neutrons of  wavelength 1,013 Angstrom. Scans parallel to the  c[.sup]*[/]-axis indicated clearly a doubling of the c-axis,  but no six doubling was seen. However, the resolution was too  low to eliminate the presence of additional satellite  reflections.    At 15 K we observed strong ferromagnetic scattering. In  addition we observed some scattering at (010), (030) and (100),  all three of them systematically extinct above T[.sub]N[/].  There also seemed to be weak scattering at  (0[.sub]3[/][.sup]4[/]0) and  (0[.sub]3[/][.sup]8[/]0). This indicates that the magnetic  ordering is not a simple ferromagnet.    Experiments on a triple axis spectrometer, using cold  neutrons(_l_ = 4 Angstrom) are planned. In this experiment we  expect to be able to resolve the crystalline superstructure and  follow the magnetic scattering as a function of temperature.  References    1.

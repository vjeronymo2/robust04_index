			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Nissan UK fights Pounds 20m damages suit Nissan UK, the former independent British importer/distributor of Nissan vehicles controlled by Mr Octav Botnar, is being sued by a former dealer for damages totalling Pounds 20.5m, according to its latest annual report. The report says the company is contesting the claim, which is expected to be heard by the High Court next month. Nissan UK, which lost the lucrative Nissan franchise in Britain with effect from the end of 1991 - when Nissan Motor, the Japanese carmaker, took over the role of importer/distributor and triggered a fierce legal battle between the two companies - is contesting tax assessments from the Inland Revenue totalling Pounds 238m. The annual report says that the Inland Revenue has failed on two occasions in front of the Special Commissioners of the Inland Revenue to obtain any payment on account. A third such hearing arranged for last July was adjourned at the Inland Revenue's request and no date had yet been fixed for a full hearing of Nissan UK's appeal. The company will 'contest the assessments in the strongest possible manner as being without foundation,' says the annual report, which was signed on September 29. The report covers the financial period for the 12 months to the end of July 1993 and discloses the impact of the loss of the Nissan franchise. According to the latest annual report of Nissan UK Holdings, which owns 100 per cent of Nissan UK, Nissan UK Holdings' turnover in the year to the end of July 1993 fell to Pounds 15.55m from Pounds 318.4m in 1991-92. Of the Pounds 15.55m, Pounds 8.98m came from discontinued operations and Pounds 5.58m from continuing activities. The group made a pre-tax loss in 1992-93 of Pounds 11.34m compared with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 19.3m a year earlier. In 1990-91 the group made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 65.4m on a turnover of Pounds 599.4m. The report says that since the loss of the Nissan franchise the 'nucleus' of the company's business has been based on property. A number of properties previously leased to dealers for the Nissan franchise continued to be leased to 'third parties with motor trade interests', and the company had purchased other properties. The company's intention was 'to maximise income and profits from Nissan UK's property portfolio in the hope that the market for retail garage properties will improve'. The company says it wrote down the value of its property portfolio by about Pounds 8m in a revaluation at the end of July 1993, owing to the depressed property market. Separately, Nissan UK has written off Pounds 31.3m from its revaluation reserve in the values of property and subsidiary companies in 1991-92 and 1992-93, reducing the reserve to Pounds 3.04m at the end of July 1993 from Pounds 34.3m two years earlier. Kidsons Impey, auditor for Nissan UK Holdings, says that because of the outstanding unresolved tax assessments from the Inland Revenue against Nissan UK it has been unable to form an opinion on whether the accounts give a 'true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company'. It says that it has been advised that evidence is likely to be submitted which cannot for legal reasons be made available to it. It adds: 'We have not obtained all the information and explanations that we considered necessary for the purpose of our audit and we were unable to determine whether proper accounting records had been maintained.'</p>

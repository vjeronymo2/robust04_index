			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mykola Dyvak: "Physician, First Heal Thyself, Or </F> Why In Moscow They Like Nizhen Cucumbers, While in Ukraine They  Rail Against High Prices"]    [Text] Two great ills have come home to roost in Ukraine:  low wages and high prices. If minimal or average wages in Russia  and Ukraine are compared at market rates of exchange, then the  difference will be five, or even ten times to the benefit of  Russia. Thus Ukrainians, more often than not, highly qualified  specialists, searching for work go to Russia. But in Russia the  food situation is more difficult, with food prices being four to  five times higher than in Ukraine. That is why all who are not  lazy buy products in Ukrainian stores and transport them en  masse to Russia. They transport them by train, by airplane, by  truck, and by passenger cars.    The peasants, who earlier usually transported into Russia  early vegetables, fruits, and berries into Russia joining in  this parcel business in large numbers. Currently they transport  whatever they happen to have: potatoes, cabbage, beets, carrots,  and home preserved vegetables and fruits. And other items as  well. Here is how it works.    Tourist bureaus for such "tourism" have converted passenger  buses to freight-passenger buses. Eight to ten people jointly  rent such a bus, each takes about ten or eleven sacks of  vegetables. At Moscow markets potatoes cost not less than 400  rubles per kilogram, and cabbage, carrots, and beets are  purchased at 700 rubles per kilogram, most expensive are pickled  cucumbers - at two to two and a half thousand per kilogram.  After converting prices from rubles to karbovanets, the price is  four to five times higher than, say, in Kiev. But the cost of  doing such business is not small. For transportation services  everyone pays close to one and a half million into the account  of the transport enterprise, and half again as much goes  directly to the driver. For bus parking, for a place at the  bazaar, bribes to the transport inspectors along the way - all  these are additional costs. These costs consume over a third of  the profits, but even so, in the end it turns out that each  "tourist" traded for two million more than if he had sold his  goods at home.    Now let us consider somewhat what this semi-domestic  business  means.    The fact that produce prices are four times lower does not  at  all signify that there is an overproduction of foodstuffs and a  low production cost but first and foremost is indicative of the  low purchasing power of the people. That is, what is being  exported is what "I would eat myself - but I need the money."  But the money earned in Moscow for the produce, as we can see  even from the example of the commercial bus trip, does not come  back to the producer. The lion's share is spent on all sorts of  taxes. In that case how are the production costs recovered,  especially for the production of the produce which is purchased  in the stores? It is a good time mention the trillions in  subsidies and non repayable credits which are allocated almost  directly from the government's budget to the village. Not only  foodstuffs are subsidized from the state budget but other goods  in wide demand.    We amicably scold the government, which cannot contain  prices, and which little considers that low prices for goods and  services in the final analysis means low wages. Low wages, in  turn, contribute to the reduction of the purchasing power and  consequently a reduction in production. And until this vicious  cycle in broken and until prices for goods and wages (because  wages are nothing but the price of labor) do not approach world  prices, then both goods and the labor force will be exported out  of Ukraine.    But these are measures from the arsenal of healing therapy,  So far, Ukrainian politicians are experimenting with the arsenal  of shock therapy.</p>

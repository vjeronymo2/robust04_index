			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRACY'S VILLAINS  </P> <P> Recently, I was the unfortunate witness to a travesty of American entertainment  that is guaranteed to affect the youth of the United States for years to come.  The travesty was "Dick Tracy," that wonderful exploitation film by Warren  Beatty.  </P> <P> Now I'm certain that Beatty's overall purpose in the film was to capture the  essence of the comic strip. That it did, but in doing so he overstepped the  bounds of taste and common sense. The look of the villains (e.g., Big Boy  Caprice, Flattop, Pruneface, Little Face, etc.) was great in that it really  helped to separate the "bad guys" from the "good guys." Did it ever occur to  anyone involved with the production that this separation is actually based more  in real life than in fantasy?  </P> <P> What is this film teaching America's youth? That physically deformed people are  essentially evil, while at the same time you can be "good" only if you are  normal? Considering the lack of sensitivity in all children of impressionable  ages, I pity any deformed person that those children might run into. Will the  children run screaming, or will they behave properly and treat the disfigured  person with respect?  </P> <P> I sincerely hope for the latter, yet with "Dick Tracy" running around torturing  and killing the disfigured "bad guys," who knows?  </P> <P> WIL SIMPSON  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 1 (CNA) -- Liang Kuo-shu, an  economist-turned banker, took the helm of the Central Bank of  China (CBC) Wednesday [1 Jun] amid high expectations.    Liang, 64, took over from Samuel Shieh, whose five-year term  expired Tuesday.    A trusted economic adviser to President Li Teng-hui, Liang  is  the first native Taiwanese to fill the governor's post.    With a doctorate in economics, Liang has spent most of his  career in banking and is considered by many as an enlightened  banker who believes the central bank should adjust its policies  in line with market forces.    Speaking at the changeover ceremony attended by hundreds of  well-wishers, Liang said he will continue to promote financial  liberalization and internationalization during his five-year  tenure.    He said he will first seek to develop Taiwan into a regional  "funding center" to provide capital for financial institutions  and private enterprises at home and abroad. "I think this is  not a difficult goal to reach as we already have a foreign  currency call-loan market that allow banks to borrow and lend  from each other," Liang explained.    He said he will push for faster liberalization of the local  financial service markets, allowing more foreign banks to set up  branches in Taiwan. "The entry of more foreign banks will  facilitate our bid to become a regional funding center and  eventually a regional financial hub," he noted.    Liang also said he will maintain the current "measured" easy  credit policy, but will tighten monitoring of lending practices  of local banks to ensure that new bank loans, particularly  medium and long-term loans, are extended to the manufacturing  sector to bolster domestic economic development.    As the Taiwan economy has failed to recover as fast as  expected, Liang said the central bank may induce further  reductions in local interest rates to prod private investment  willingness.    Noting that the central bank's most important responsibility  is to maintain price stability, Liang said he won't sit idle and  let the local currency's value drop drastically simply because  of market speculation.    He said that although the local currency's 2.4 percent  depreciation over the past month may benefit exporters, it may  also fuel inflationary pressure and thus destabilize commodity  price stability and hinder economic growth.    In addition, Liang said, he will make the central bank's  policy-making process clear to the public, and will upgrade its  level of professionalism and protect it from political  interference. He also promised to let more people with a  reputation for specialized knowledge and integrity take part in  the bank's decision-making process.</p>

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / International Company News: Review of Microsoft's Intuit purchase extended The US Justice Department anti-trust division has extended its review of Microsoft's Dollars 1.5bn acquisition of Intuit, a leading publisher of personal finance software, potentially delaying the deal. The acquisition plan was submitted to the Justice Department last month for a routine 30-day review. Microsoft acknowledged yesterday, however, that it had received a 'second request' for information from the Justice Department, extending the review beyond the normal deadline. 'We believe this is an indication of the commitment of the Department to thoroughly review (the transaction),' Microsoft said. 'We remain confident it will be approved.' Microsoft declined to comment, however, on what aspects of its plan were being questioned. Competitors fear the deal could allow Microsoft, the world's largest software company, to achieve a dominant position in the emerging market for on-line financial services. Microsoft already leads in several other PC software segments. It holds an estimated 80 per cent share of the market for operating system programs that control the basic functions of a PC. Intuit is one of the few companies to have competed directly with Microsoft and won. Intuit's Quicken program is used by about 6m PC owners, or 75 per cent of all 'active personal finance users', according to Intuit. Microsoft's competing Money program has captured only a tiny share of the market since it was introduced two years ago. In an attempt to avoid anti-trust problems, Microsoft has agreed to divest its Money program to Novell, another software company, for undisclosed terms. A broad anti-trust investigation this year of Microsoft's business practices was concluded when the company agreed to change the way it licenses software to PC manufacturers. As part of that agreement, Microsoft was placed under the scrutiny of US and European competition authorities for six-and-a-half years.</p>

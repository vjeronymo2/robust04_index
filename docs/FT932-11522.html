			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Upturn that can spell business ruin: An end to recession may be a poisoned chalice for small and medium-sized companies. Charles Batchelor assesses their chances THE ECONOMIC upturn is likely to prove a mixed blessing. For many businesses an increase in orders will be a welcome relief but for a significant minority it will be the final strain on recession-stretched finances. Mr Philip Mellor, marketing manager of business information group Dun &amp; Bradstreet, said: 'With competition as tough and margins as tight as ever, taking on that extra person or buying that extra piece of machinery to meet a new order may be enough to put a company under.' Pinpointing those companies most likely to succumb to the upturn is difficult. Ultimately survival hinges on how well the business is managed. But it is possible to sketch an outline of vulnerable businesses. One at risk is a small company in construction or manufacturing with a high borrowing level, and based in the south. The dangers attached to this profile will be reduced if the management has a good relationship with its bank and if it takes on only those orders which it can finance from prompt-paying customers. The smaller and younger the company the greater the risk of failure. New businesses lack the managerial experience and financial resources available to more established counterparts. One in three new companies closes in its first three years, regardless of the economy. Ms Barbara Bennett, corporate affairs manager at Trade Indemnity, a credit insurance company, said: 'Smaller companies have little muscle to ensure they get paid on time and are particularly vul-nerable to the one large debt.' Small sub-contractors in the construction sector, where slow payment from main contractors is widespread, are at particular risk. But sub-contractors in other sectors such as engineering, where there may be extended payment chains down from the final customer, are also exposed. Mr Robert Drummond, chairman of the British Venture Capital Association and managing director of Grosvenor Venture Managers, said: 'Companies which effectively act as bankers, giving credit to their customers but taking little from their suppliers, will be most at risk.' Manufacturing has a greater need for finance than the service sector. 'Anyone with a long production process, where the balance sheet is full of working capital will suffer,' noted Mr Drummond. The most recent business survey by the Association of British Chambers of Commerce highlights the dangers. On balance 17 per cent of manufacturers employing fewer than 20 people reported a worsening cashflow in the last quarter of last year compared with just 4 per cent of service companies. Larger companies all reported improved cashflows. Worryingly, small manufacturers had the most ambitious investment plans. On balance 14 per cent planned investments in plant and machinery while only 3 per cent of large companies, employing more than 500 people, planned similar investments. Ms Fiona Johnson, economic adviser to the chambers, said: 'It is the small-firms sector which tends to lead the economy out of the recession.' Another sector which may be at risk is stockists and merchants who do not add much value to their supplies. Steel stockholders and timber and paper merchants may make a profit on current stocks but new supplies will have to be bought in. Sterling's devaluation will raise the cost of imports and increase financing requirements, Ms Bennett said. Mr Stan Mendham, chief executive of the Forum of Private Business, said good relations with a bank were essential in an upturn: 'Small businesses will come out of the recession with their assets worth less and no profits . . . They must have a good deal with the bank, making clear what they want and providing the bank manager with the information he needs.' Businesses which plan ahead will be the most likely to win their bank manager's support. A survey for Barclays Bank showed service companies tended to plan more than manufacturers, while companies in the north were more convinced of the value of planning than those in the south. But regardless of sector, size or location, survival through the upturn will depend on companies not getting carried away by new orders. Mr Mike Davis, managing director of Barclays Commercial Services, said: 'We have seen companies which have been so relieved to get an order that they forget the fundamental disciplines about making sure they get paid.'</p>

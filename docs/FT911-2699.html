			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (4): Qualified success of ERM - Europe's exchange rate mechanism AMONG the more successful European innovations of the last 15 years is the exchange rate mechanism, set up in 1979 as a way of regulating the main west European currencies. Keeping the currencies within agreed limits against each other, it was argued, would encourage monetary stability, so reducing inflationary pressures. The mechanism would also aid commerce and industry by minimising exchange rate fluctuations. Twelve years on, the general consensus is that the system has achieved most of its aims. 'The ERM has been remarkably successful', says Mr Jim O'Neill, head of financial markets research at Swiss Bank Corporation in London. In the case of the pound, which joined the system only last October, that statement needs to be qualified. Economists are divided over the extent to which the external discipline of the ERM will improve UK economic performance - particularly in inflation, where Britain's record over the past 20 years has been far from satisfactory. All but two of the 12 European Community member states (the exceptions are Greece and Portugal) participate in the mechanism. That means the ERM embraces nine currencies - the D-Mark, the French franc, the peseta, the guilder, the Belgian/Luxembourg franc, the Danish krone, the punt and the pound. The pound, the last currency to join the system, and the peseta are allowed to fluctuate against the others by up to 6 per cent about an agreed central rate: for the other currencies, the permitted margin is 2.25 per cent. In the early days of the system, realignments tocentral ERM rates were relatively frequent. Over recent years, however, the system has been more stable; the last full-scale realignment was in 1987. Co-ordination is left largely to officials at individual nations' central banks. These people talk to each other roughly three times a day. Their discussions will cover day-to-day issues such as the need for small changes in interest rates. Another topic is the degree to which countries may need to intervene in financial markets to influence the value of specific currencies by buying or selling. Such operations are put in the hands of specialist foreign exchange departments of each central bank. Given the size of the world foreign exchange market, there is no way that the outside world can find out about specific dealings in currencies by the banks - unless these bodies broadcast their intentions with a view to influencing the market. Highly public currency interventions by the ERM nations' central banks have been a feature of the first few months of this year, as the individual countries have sought to influence the value of the dollar. More far-reaching decisions about the workings of the ERM, such as significant realignments, are left to meetings of EC finance ministers and central bank governors. One of the chief virtues of the ERM, according to itsadmirers, concerns the way individual currencies within the mechanism are pegged to the low-inflation characteristics of the D-Mark, the mechanism's most powerful member. That forces the other ERM nations to adopt strict monetary policies that should lead them to levels of price stability similar to Germany's. The ERM medicine has certainly worked over the past decade for the Netherlands, Belgium and France, which today can boast inflation records not far removed from Germany's. UK government ministers, meanwhile, are hoping the same will happen over the next few years for Britain, although public opinion has yet to be won overto the the ERM. A group of monetarist economists, led by Sir Alan Walters, the former economic adviser to Mrs Margaret Thatcher, is waging guerrilla war against Britain's membership of ERM. The group wrote to The Times in February saying that Britain's membership of the ERM meant it had to institute inappropriately high interest rates which could push the country into deep recession. For all the general interest by the ERM nations in wanting the D-Mark to stay strong so as to reinforce the disciplinary impact of the system, some signs have emerged in recent weeks of a certain satisfaction in the rest of Europe about the weakness in the D-Mark. The D-Mark has lost ground dramatically, mainly against the dollar but also against a number of European currencies, as fears gripped markets about the possibly negative consequences for the global economy of German unity. The D-Mark's fall from grace may lead to a slackening, at least for the time being, in the way the ERM reinforces anti-inflationary characteristics aspects among the other countries. But the monetary authorities in France and Britain have had good cause to smile, on the grounds that the weakness in the currency has given them far more scope within the system to cut interest rates and so restore growth. One problem for many of the ERM nations in recent months has concerned the Spanish peseta, the strongest currency in the grid. The attraction to international investors of the currency has correspondingly weakened demand for some of the other currencies, and has made life particularly difficult for the monetary authorities in France - whose franc is the weakest currency in the system. Could the ERM act as a forerunner to a grand world system of linked exchange rates? A world exchange rate system, connecting the main European currencies with the yen and the dollar, would follow from the increased co-operation on an economic and monetary level among the world's main industrial powers since the 1970s. It would also underline the degree to which the world economy is becoming increasingly integrated as a result of the way that large business operations plan their operations.</p>

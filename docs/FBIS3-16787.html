According to the Central Electoral Commission, elections were  scheduled for that day in the Belgorod, Vologda, Kamchatka,  Kirov, Leningrad, Murmansk, Omsk, Orenburg, Oryol, Perm,  Smolensk, Tver and Chita regions, the city of St. Petersburg and  three autonomous districts -- the Aga- Buryat, the Komi-Perm and  the Nenets districts.    Elections to the supreme representative body of the  Aga-Buryat Autonomous District, the district duma, have taken  place. Residents of that steppe area showed a traditionally  high activity: some 60 per cent of electors came to the polling  stations. The elections were recognised as valid in all the 15  constituencies. The district duma will be made up mostly of  heads of regional organisations, agricultural amalgamations and  industrial enterprises.    At the same time, the activity of electors in the Chita  region was unprecedentedly low. According to preliminary data,  a little more than 30 per cent of electors took part in the  voting. An electoral campaign and elections will have to be  repeated in five out of 21 constituencies, a spokesman for the  regional electoral commission told ITAR-TASS.    Candidates, nominated or supported by the democratic forces  of the Baykal territory, suffered a serious defeat in the Chita  region. Most seats in the regional parliament went to heads of  industrial enterprises, farms and budget-financed institutions.    The legislative assembly of the Orenburg region will not be  able to start working. Protocols from local electoral  commissions are still coming, but it is known already that the  elections were not recognised as valid in 19 out of 47  constituencies: 12 -- in Orenburg, six -- in Orsk and one in  Novotroitsk. Repeated elections will be held in three months in  those constituencies, where electors did not come to the polling  stations. According to the information, received by ITAR-TASS  at the regional electoral commission, the elections were a  complete failure in the city of Orenburg, which includes 13  constituencies. Only one deputy was elected, while in the rest  of the constituencies the elections were recognised as invalid,  because too few people took part in the voting.    Kamchatka residents also failed to elect deputies to the  regional legislative assembly with the first attempt. Elections  were recognised as valid in five out of eight constituencies,  while in three biggest four-seat constituencies, located on the  territory of the administrative centre of the region, only 17  per cent of electors came to the polling stations. Thus, only  nine out of 21 deputies were elected, a spokesman for the  regional electoral commission told ITAR-TASS. According to his  information, elections to the city dumas were valid in Yelizovo  and Vilyuchinsk, while Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy was left  without a representative body. A referendum on giving new names  to the streets and moving monuments to Lenin to other places did  not take place either. Today the regional electoral commission  is expected to name the date of repeated elections to the  legislative assembly.    The regional assembly of people's representatives has been  formed in the Belgorod region. The March 20 elections showed a  comparatively high activity of electors: some 44 per cent of  them came to the polling stations. However, the figures differ  much in various constituencies. In rural areas the figure was  55 per cent, while in Belgorod -- 24.3 per cent and in Stary  Oskol -- 24.4 per cent. As a result of it, the elections were  recognised as invalid in three out of five constituencies of  Belgorod and in two out of three constituencies of Stary Oskol.  The overall result is that the elections were held in 16 out of  21 constituencies, and in all the 16 of them deputies to the  regional assembly were elected. This is enough for the new  representative authority to start working. About half of the  seats went to heads and deputy heads of local city and district  administrations.    Elections in the Perm region did take place, but only 34.4  per cent of electors came to the polling stations. According to  preliminary information, 37 deputies to the regional assembly  were elected, while in three constituencies the elections were  recognised as invalid because of a small number of participants.  Two out of 14 seats in the Perm City Duma remained vacant. The  Perm regional assembly will include nine representatives of  business circles, ten senior executives of enterprises and seven  heads or deputy heads of local administrations.    In the Kirov region 36 per cent of the electorate took part  in elections to the regional duma and local government bodies.  The elections were valid in 45 out of 48 constituencies. The  regional duma will include 13 heads of agro-industrial  enterprises, 11 heads of local administrations, nine medics, one  workers. One woman was elected to the regional duma.    Elections were recognised as invalid in the Lenin and  Oktyabrskiy districts of Kirov and in the city of  Kirovo-Chepetsk, the second largest city of the region after the  administrative centre. Only 25 per cent of electors came to the  polling stations.    Elections to the regional duma were a complete failure in  Murmansk. None of the three constituencies registered the  needed number of electors. According to preliminary  information, only 20.6 per cent of them took part in the voting  in the Lenin district of the city. The figure for the  Oktyabrskiy district is 19.6 per cent, and for the Pervomaiskiy  district -- only 13.4 per cent. Information from other  constituencies is being specified.</p>

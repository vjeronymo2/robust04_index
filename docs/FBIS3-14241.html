This  brought together shaykhs, notables, social figures, clergymen,  merchants, and representatives of parties, political  organizations, and popular associations [words indistinct].    The brother Presidential Council chairman spoke to them. He  welcomed them and exchanged with them congratulations on the  advent of the blessed 'Id al-Fitr. He expressed his immense  appreciation of the militant positions and the high national  sense of responsibility demonstrated by the Ma'rib Governorate  residents. He also appreciated their keenness to stick to  national constants, foremost among which are the revolution,  unity, and democracy. He also praised the militant roles played  by the Ma'rib Governorate population in defense of the march of  the revolution and the Republic.    The brother Presidential Council chairman added: Ma'rib is  the epitome of history, civilization, loyalty, and glories. I  have always been with you in all circumstances and conditions.  I have listened to your grievances. I am aware of the  sufferings caused for the Ma'rib Governorate, particularly since  it was isolated and deprived of its right to development. Since  1981, the governorate has seen a tangible development effort.  Much has been done in Ma'rib, thanks to the cooperation of its  population. We have great hopes that we will be able to  implement further service and development projects to promote  the quality of life in Ma'rib.    During his meeting with the population of the Ma'rib  Governorate, the brother Presidential Council chairman reviewed  current national developments, the background and implications  of the current political crisis, the factors affecting its  course, and its impact on the country and national unity, as  well as the harm it has caused the homeland and citizens, who  are currently overburdened by the continued crisis, which should  not have reached this state of affairs in the first place.    The brother Presidential Council chairman noted that our  people regained their unity on 22 May 1990, when the Yemeni  community was reunified, [words indistinct] potentials and  capabilities so that the development endeavor may be promoted,  and so the homeland may see progress. He said efforts have  continued to be made to cope with the current crisis. He  stressed the need for Constitutional institutions to convene  their meetings so together they may shoulder their  responsibilities toward the implementation of the accord  document, and in order to promote trust and safeguard the march  of unity and democracy in our country.    The brother Presidential Council chairman asserted that  there  is no way for the separatist past to be recreated, and that  there is no going back on unity, regardless of the price  entailed, because unity is the ideal of all Yemenis' pride and  dignity. It is the present and future of the homeland.    The brother president warned against all forms of division  within the society. He added: We must confront all feeble  souls who cause differences, conflicts, and parochial disputes,  be they regional, sectarian, tribal, or otherwise. For our  people are an Arab and Muslim people. They have a common creed,  common principles, and common objectives. They strongly adhere  to their Islamic creed and their national constants. We must  unify our ranks, and positions. Our top priority must be to  spare our homeland sedition and conflicts, and to promote its  quest for construction, development, unity, and democracy so  that it may reach safe shores.    The brother president commended the decisions and  recommendations made by the expanded conference of the Ma'rib  Governorate masses. He blessed these decisions, which reflected  a high sense of national responsibility aimed at sparing the  homeland division and rifts and safeguarding its unity.  Besides, these decisions reflected the patriotic sentiments and  truthful intent of the Ma'rib Governorate, which are best seen  in hard circumstances and critical junctures in the homeland's  history. He reiterated that democracy will continue to  safeguard and fortify unity, and that differences, regardless of  how serious they are, must be resolved through peaceful and  democratic dialogue. He indicated that the Yemenis have  embraced democracy, and that they must shoulder the consequences  of democracy, regardless of what they may be. For democracy and  pluralism have caused us to acknowledge and accept the peaceful  exchange of authority. It is we who announced that the Yemeni  president must not be allowed to rule for more than two  presidential terms in office so that a new leadership may be  allowed to take over, and to expand the base of power-sharing.  The homeland provides ample room for all. Besides, it is the  property of all Yemenis, the brother president said.    The brother president added: The past, which is marked by  separation, provides us with an abundance of lessons, from which  we must learn. We must do everything that can serve our  homeland and promote its higher interests. We must spare no  effort to build the homeland and achieve renaissance and  development in it. We will do our best to achieve this, in  cooperation with all well-meaning parties in the homeland.  [passage omitted]</p>

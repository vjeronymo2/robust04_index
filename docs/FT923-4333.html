			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / European attack on Japan's barriers THE European Business Community in Japan has attacked the Japanese car market for being 'de facto a closed shop'. In a recently published report it maintains that 'many non-tariff barriers and structural impediments remain.' According to the EBC's automotive committee the share of imported cars in the Japanese new car market has only risen to 4 per cent despite the removal of tariff barriers since the 1980s. The committee claims that the European Community's automobile trade deficit with Japan has continued to grow significantly and reached almost Ecu4bn (Pounds 2.9bn) in the first half of 1992, accounting for about 30 per cent of the EC's total trade deficit with Japan. The EBC automotive committee maintains that an import market share of 17.5 per cent of the total Japanese new car market is 'an essential and realistic target' for all importers by the year 2000. Acea, the association of European vehicle makers in Brussels, yesterday urged the European Commission to press for 'enhanced market access' in Japan. Acea is urging the Commission to make 'reciprocal automotive competition' the key to further progress in EC-Japan automotive trade relations. The call comes as the European motor industry faces the start of a challenging new era for Japanese vehicle imports from January with the advent of the single European market. From the beginning of 1993 the present system of bilateral restraints on Japanese direct vehicle exports to five EC countries - France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and the UK - is to be replaced by a joint monitoring system administered by Brussels and Tokyo.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Wang Kejun (3769 0344 6511): "China's City and </F> Town Unemployment Rate Shows a Slight Increase"]    [Text] China's third quarter employment growth remained  sluggish, employment growth in urban collective units was even  slower, employment growth among privately managed business and  individuals was fairly rapid, and the urban unemployment rate  rose slightly.    Based on statistics, 147.37 million persons nationwide were  employed at the end of September, 580,000 more than at the end  of the second quarter, but 550,000 fewer than at the end of last  year. Comparing previous year levels at the same period, there  was a nearly 100,000-person fluctuation between the end of last  year and the end of September. Such a degree of fluctuation had  not been seen in the last ten years.    Comparing ownership systems, we see that urban collective  units lost quite a few workers, while the various joint venture  units and foreign capital units continued to increase their  employee ranks. Comparing industries, industry lost a  considerable number of workers, while employment in the  construction, health and fitness, and finance and insurance  fields rose slightly. Looking at state-owned units, a fair  number of permanent employees were cut, while contract employees  grew in sizeable numbers.    Statistics provided by the State Administration for Industry  and Commerce show that at the end of September private and  individual employment in urban areas reached 11.5 million, an  increase of 800,000 or 4.5 percent over the end of last year.  Compared with last year's level at the same period, the  increase was 500,000 employees or 5.4 percent.    Looking at the different industries, employment growth was  sizeable in the commercial and food service industries which  accounted for about 70 percent of the total increase. Industry  and construction employment, however, grew minimally, accounting  for only about 30 percent of the total growth.    Comparing regions, employment growth in the four provinces  of  Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangsu, and Sichuan was significant, with  each recording over 50,000 new employees, while employment  growth in the three minicipalities of Beijing, Shanghai, and  Tianjin was minimal, with each having less than 10,000 newly  employed workers.    According to Ministry of Labor statistics, at the end of  September, the urban unemployment number stood at 3.78 million  persons, or at a rate of 2.4 percent. This is 0.1 percent  higher than the level at the end of last year. It is estimated  that the unemployment rate will rise to around 2.6 percent by  the end of this year.    Overall, the current urban unemployment situation is not  growing significantly. Yet, in certain areas the unemployment  rate continues to grow. This is especially true with respect to  the aged, the young, border areas, and certain areas of the  defense industry, mining, and the forestry industry where  regional economic growth has been slow and workers have not  departed in significant numbers. Generally, with respect to  these areas, unemployment stands at over three percent, with  some areas experiencing upwards of ten percent unemployment.</p>

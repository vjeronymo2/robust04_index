			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LEADER OF 1988 JAILBREAK GETS LIFE IN PRISON PLUS 25 YEARS  </P> <P> The leader in a five-man escape from Orange County Jail two years ago was  sentenced to life in prison plus 25 years Thursday for kidnaping a Santa Ana  man and taking his car during the escapees' getaway.  </P> <P> But Michael D. Taylor's days in court are far from over.  </P> <P> Taylor, 38, whose capture in South Dakota was aided by the TV show "America's  Most Wanted," faces murder charges in Los Angeles County and charges in Alameda  County involving a kidnap/rape following his jail escape, as well as the  original charges involving seven robberies that first landed him in County  Jail.  </P> <P> Should he ever resolve those cases, Taylor faces parole violation charges in  Illinois and is a suspect in robberies in Colorado, Illinois, Iowa and Indiana.  </P> <P> "This guy, from the day he turned 18, has been totally sociopathic," said  Deputy Dist. Atty. Ron Cafferty.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Manuel A. Ramirez told Taylor, who also goes by the name  of Anthony Michael Gianelli, that he would have sentenced him to life in prison  without possibility of parole if he could have. The judge gave Taylor the  stiffest sentence possible -- a life term that permits parole -- plus 25 years  after that, five years for each of Taylor's five previous robbery and burglary  convictions.  </P> <P> While Taylor did not speak at his sentencing hearing, he could be heard  mumbling complaints about the television cameras present in the courtroom for  Fox Network's "America's Most Wanted."  </P> <P> Taylor and four other inmates escaped from jail on Nov. 20, 1988, by descending  from the roof using knotted bedsheets while one of the jail deputies was  missing from his post.  </P> <P> An individual who lived near the jail called 911 to report seeing one of the  men peeling out of his jail clothes. Reports showed, however, that it would be  another 20 minutes before any officials discovered that a jailbreak had taken  place.  </P> <P> One deputy was fired over the incident, and a second one was suspended. One  escapee broke a leg during the descent from the roof, and he and a second man  were caught immediately.  </P> <P> Taylor and two other escapees stripped out of jail clothes and down to boxer  shorts and shirts and then approached Donald Lamb in his carport at an  apartment complex on North Bristol Street. They told him they needed a ride to  a hospital where a friend had just been taken. When Lamb showed reluctance to  help them, one of the three put a jail-made knife to his throat and threatened  to kill him.  </P> <P> Lamb testified that somewhere in Garden Grove they finally let him stop the car  and he managed to escape. He also said he asked them to leave him alone but one  of those with Taylor responded by kicking him in the head. Lamb said he then  ran, fearing for his life, and the three drove off in his car. It was found  later in Westminster, Colo.  </P> <P> Taylor's attorney, Martin Kossack, argued that what happened did not amount to  an actual kidnaping since Taylor and the others only wanted the car. At one  point in his legal papers, Kossack told the court: "It was the victim who  abandoned the vehicle to the three. (Taylor) did not, at any time, attempt to  rob Mr. Lamb of his vehicle."  </P> <P> Cafferty said after the sentencing Thursday that the defense seemed to be  arguing that "law-abiding citizens are supposed to just cave in to lawless  people."  </P> <P> Taylor told The Times Orange County Edition in a jailhouse interview that he  felt compelled to escape from the jail because of inmate beatings and its poor  health conditions.  </P> <P> "I was dying there; I was sick all the time," Taylor said.  </P> <P> During the interview, Taylor admitted to a number of robberies after his escape  but denied a rape charge.  </P> <P> At his trial, he testified that Lamb had willingly driven the three.  </P> <P> The other two involved in the Lamb kidnaping were caught within weeks of the  escape.  </P> <P> Taylor, however, was not caught until six months later, after he was featured  on the Fox program.  </P> <P> The show aired on May 7, 1989, and led to a tip that he and his girlfriend had  been seen in Portland, Me. The FBI learned that he was going by the name of  Michael A. Prescott.  </P> <P> Subsequently, a jeweler in Grand Rapids, S.D., called police and said that  someone trying to sell him some jewels had seemed suspicious and that his name  was Michael Prescott. Because of the TV show, the Prescott alias had been  entered in the national crime data computer, and Taylor was soon arrested.  </P></p>

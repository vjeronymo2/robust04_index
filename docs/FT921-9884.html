			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Bulgaria eases curbs on foreigninvestment THE BULGARIAN parliament has passed a foreign investment law aimed at attracting western enterprises, which may finally be part of a much more comprehensive economic reform package. The law, which supersedes a law implemented in 1990, abolishes restrictions on the repatriation of profits, allows western enterprises to own Bulgarian companies, and permits foreign investors to set up their own enterprises in the country. The law also permits foreign companies to acquire a share in Bulgarian banks, or set up their own banks, subject to authorisation from the National Bank of Bulgaria. This is likely to have a significant effect on the country's banking system, which until recently was highly centralised and politically controlled. It might also make it easier for western investors to speed up their transactions when doing business with Bulgaria. However, the Bulgarian government, in common with some of the other countries in eastern Europe, has yet to decide how far it is willing to extend property and ownership rights to non-Bulgarian citizens. For instance, foreigners may acquire a right of ownership in buildings, presumably for business activities, and may acquire a residential property, but only by applying to build that property. Moreover, no foreign person can acquire the right of ownership of land, agricultural or otherwise. The slow pace of reform is due in part to the considerable influence still wielded by the former Communist party. As the Bulgarian Socialist party, it continues to hold more than 30 per cent of the seats in the parliament. In addition, the Union of Democratic Forces, the loose coalition of parties now in government, remains divided over the pace of reform. Despite economic problems, Bulgaria is one of the most stable countries in the Balkans, and Mr Zhelyu Zhelev, who has been elected as president for a second term, appears determined to proceed with economic reforms, and to improve relations with the country's immediate neighbours.</p>

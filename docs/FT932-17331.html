			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Queens Moat It would be rash to draw too many conclusions for the hotel sector from the troubles of Queens Moat. The company has always had a weakness for taking on new properties. That explains its past propensity for rights issues and its present heavy indebtedness. It may be that its German expansion, which seemed such an advantage at the height of the UK recession, is catching up with it. Investors will clearly have to wait a while to find out. Meanwhile they must envy the good fortune of Mr Martin Marcus, deputy chairman, who sold 1.1m shares to meet personal obligations at an average price of just over 57p before the company entered its closed season in February. That compares with a suspension price of 47 1/2 p.</p>

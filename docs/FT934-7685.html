			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (44): Big shake-up under way - Oil and gas industries MR HAN GENGSHENG, vice-president of the China National Chemicals Import and Export Corporation, seemed remarkably sanguine for a man who had recently seen his organisation lose its lucrative monopoly over the marketing of Chinese crude oil and derivatives. 'Economic reform will inevitably have some unpleasant effects on companies with monopoly positions,' he says. 'But I believe that this kind of reform provides challenges and opportunities for development.' Sinochem, as the giant state trading corporation is known - the company ranked 29th in 1992 on the Fortune 500 list - has been obliged to enter 50-50 joint ventures with the China National Petroleum Corporation for crude exports, and with the China Petrochemical Corporation (Sinopec) for the marketing of refined products. Formation of the new joint venture companies, China Oil and the China International United Chemical Orporation (Unipec), represents one of the biggest shake-ups in China's oil sector in many years, and also coincides with the abolition of the Ministry of Energy under a streamlining of the bureaucracy approved this year by the National People's Congress, China's parliament. Mr Wang Tao, chairman of China National Petroleum Corporation, left no doubt in an interview that he derived particular satisfaction from the new arrangements that will involve CNPC not only in the production of crude, but also in marketing. He plans to use extra revenues from these ventures to further develop CNPC's activities domestically, including investments in refineries. CNPC is also interested in expanding its reach abroad through its China National Development Company, established in 1981, to seek opportunities in exploration and development, but whose activities have been severely curtailed because of lack of funds. Changes in the oil sector also coincide with the beginning of a period of heightened activity involving foreign companies in the search for oil in China's onshore regions, especially in the promising Tarim basin area of far-western Xinjiang region. Mr Wang said earlier this year that in addition to the 11 southern provinces of China which had already been opened to foreign involvement, an additional 12 areas would also be offered, including remote regions of Qinghai province and Xinjiang in the west, and Inner Mongolia in the north-west. China attracted a good response from the oil majors in March when it offered five blocs in the prospective Tarim basin covering an area of 72,730 sq km. EFFORTS to engage foreign companies in the development of China's oil reserves (estimated at 30bn barrels) are being given added urgency by the likelihood that by 1995 at the latest the country will become a net crude oil importer. Mr Wang estimates that exports will exceed exports this year by about 4m tonnes. Onshore production this year is expected to be much the same as last year's 138m tonnes. But he warned that with economic growth anticipated this year of about 13 per cent, it was unrealistic to expect that China could continue to produce more oil than it consumed without big new discoveries. 'The petroleum industry is developing like a tortoise, and GNP growth like a hare,' he observes. Even if good discoveries are made in the Tarim basin, it will be some years, and possibly not until the turn of the century before oil is flowing in large quantities from China's far west. The cost of building a pipeline more than 2,000 kms from the Tarim area across rugged terrain to connect with the national pipeline grid is estimated at about UDollars 2bn. Exploration activity is also continuing in offshore areas; although the crushing disappointment, not to mention huge losses, suffered by Western companies such as British Petroleum in the 1980s in a fruitless search, has dampened much of the early enthusiasm. Mr Chen Binqian, vice president of the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), said his organisation was pressing on with its efforts to engage foreign companies in prospective areas offshore, such as the East China Sea, the Pearl River delta, and waters off Hainan Island in the south. Mr Chen expects to have awarded contracts for 13 concessions in the East China Sea by the end of the year. CNOOC itself continues to be active in its efforts to lift production at its own wells in areas such as the Bohai Sea, in China's northern water, where it brought onstream a new field in September. It is also looking forward to Agip, Chevron, Texaco, Philips and Amoco bringing relatively small fields into production between 1994-1996 in the Pearl River area. This year, CNOOC expects oil production from offshore areas to reach 5m tonnes - and to grow to about 12m tonnes by 1997. But disappointed by results of oil exploration offshore, it is looking increasingly to its gas finds to justify its own existence, and to provide energy to fuel China's booming economy, especially in its energy-deficient southern regions, and Hong Kong. By 1996, CNOOC expects to be supplying 2.9bn cu. metres annually to Hong Kong, and 500m cu. metres to Hainan island itself from fields off the island's south coast. More finds are being made in waters off Hainan, and CNOOC hopes to be supplying 20bn cu. metres to consumers in Hong Kong and on the mainland by early next century.</p>

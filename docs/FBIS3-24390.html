			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by D. Brodyanskiy, authorized electoral </F> representative of Russian Republican Party Maritime Kray  organization and authorized representative of candidates to kray  duma V.I. Cherepkov and T.G. Romanenko, under the "An Eyewitness  Account" rubric: "Lebedinets and Tolstoshein Took the Mayoralty  by Storm"]    [Text] A roundtable at the UTRO ROSSII editorial offices  was interrupted by an agitated female voice: The mayoralty is  under attack. But.... the mayoralty was not stormed for  another.... 15-20 minutes. They began at 1814: An OMON [Special  Purpose Militia Detachment] detachment poured out from a couple  of dozen cars and, having easily pushed aside the women at the  entrance, stomped to the 10th floor. The door to the mayor's  office was broken down (this is the way they probably "seize"  apartments?). Women were dragged out of the building by the arm.  I personally saw V.A. Gilgenberg, for the third day the acting  mayor (the mayor himself is ill) being thrown out of the  building; in the process the metal door was thrown open by  Gilgenberg's head squeezed under the arm of a powerfully built  OMON soldier. The whole operation was directed personally by  Lebedinets, who had announced the dismissal of the mayor on the  grounds of criminal proceedings initiated against him and the  appointment of a new mayor--Tolstoshein, and his deputy  Terekhov. Attorney Ulitskiy was not permitted to visit Cherepkov.    At 0100 the pickets and journalists who gathered at the  mayoralty became witnesses and participants in the concluding  part of the operation: An OMON group, pushing their way through  the crowd, carried out V.I. Cherepkov; his face was a strange  green color and lifeless. The mayor was placed into an ambulance  surrounded by militiamen, which then took him and his wife home.  The small apartment quickly filled with people (it had not  occurred to our mayor to get for himself a larger apartment  while he was in power). The ambulance physician apologized--she  was only carrying out orders. She recalled what a good doctor  Gartman used to be. Now this participant in the operation  approved the "transfer" of the patient that night. Which means  that Gartman used to be a doctor; who he is now is not for us to  judge. Among those watching the proceedings from the mayoralty's  steps was a militia officer and some imposing figure in a  "macho" black coat. I asked him to introduce himself but got no  answer. I was told this actually was Tolstoshein.    At the same time, in a classic Bolshevik manner, they went  after rayons where new heads of administration were installed.  Head of Pervorechenskiy Rayon A.V. Kuchinskiy had his official  car--some "land-cruiser" that before then had served  Tolstoshein--confiscated while he was riding in it. The coup was  now complete.    People we called in the State Duma assured us that this was  all illegal. That opening a door with a man's head is illegal is  obvious even without the Duma. That a sick man is "treated" by  OMON is inhuman. That on the eve of elections all this is done  to candidates is a mockery of the recently adopted Constitution.  All together it is a slap in the face of the city, all of us.  People may have different feelings about the mayor and his  supporters, but when the law is trampled so brazenly, openly, it  means that no one is safe--tomorrow they can use the head of any  of us as a battering ram. Kray Procurator V.V. Vasilenko  postponed a telephone conversation regarding candidates' rights  until tomorrow, and denied his part in the operation--it is the  investigator, he said. Someone among the "bearers" told  Gilgenberg that the "kray court had concurred" on the action.    The militia--dozens of cars and about 100 participants--have  demonstrated its might and drive. Would it not be nice if they  used all this might against racketeers, apartment burglars, and  pickpockets--Vladivostok would be safer than Lillehamer.    Office windows lit up one after another at the mayoralty's  floors; S.P. Goryacheva probably will now have more material for  new denunciations of the trashed mayoralty. There was no concern  for observing due process--it is not necessary to comply with  its norms during a coup. What to do, everybody will now decide  for himself. But we do have to turn out for elections. And vote  in such a way that would deprive the party of the nomenklatura  coup from getting the votes--at least in our city.</p>

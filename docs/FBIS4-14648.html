			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report attributed to BNS: "L. Linkevicius Withdraws From </F> Seimas National Security Committee"]    [Text] National Defense Minister L. Linkevicius has stated  that he considers his further presence in the Seimas  [parliament] National Security Committee "unnecessary." In his  application to Seimas Chairman C. Jursenas and J. Karosas,  leader of the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party faction, the  minister requests to be removed from the list of committee  members and expresses the desire to return to the Foreign  Affairs Committee.    L. Linkevicius said in an interview with a BNS correspondent  that he did not approve of the committee's work methods and the  understanding of its functions in many cases. The minister  thinks that the interpretation of the principle of parliamentary  control is not always correct in Lithuania. "This is not  leading someone by the hand and adopting decisions for the  executive sector," said the minister. He admitted that he  himself had a chance to experience such deputies' ambitions.    Concerning his desire to return to the Foreign Affairs  Committee, in the minister's opinion, his work at the National  Defense Ministry is closely linked with foreign policy.</p>

			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Fresh chapter opens on Shanghai's exchange THE attractions of the Shanghai Vacuum Electron Device Company may not be readily apparent from its name, but the company opened a new chapter in China's financial history yesterday when shares owned by foreigners began trading on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. For the first time since the communists took power in 1949, foreigners have been permitted to trade freely in a publicly quoted Chinese asset. The company is also the first Chinese state-owned company to admit foreign owners. If Shanghai Vacuum's first day of trading is anything to go by, then China's fledgling experiment with elements of capitalism, known as 'socialism with Chinese characteristics', got off to a good start. The company's share price rose 26 per cent from its issue price of Dollars 70 to close at Dollars 88.50 a share, on a turnover of 3,430 shares. Shanghai Vacuum is one of China's leading manufacturers of television tubes (both black and white, and colour) and electron guns. It is also the pride of Shanghai and, by virtue of city government regulation, holds a virtual monopoly for what it manufactures. Three weeks ago, a group of foreign merchant banks, led by SBCI Asia Finance, placed 1m 'B' shares in the company with international investors. The placement, which was four times oversubscribed, raised Dollars 78m which the company plans to use to increase its output of colour TV tubes. The shares were due to start trading on Thursday but the Shanghai authorities requested a day's delay because February 20 was not deemed auspicious.</p>

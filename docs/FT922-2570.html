			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Osman's lawyers in court plea LAWYERS for Mr Lorrain Osman, Britain's longest-serving remand prisoner, were due this morning to submit an application to the High Court to stay his extradition to Hong Kong after discovering that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, had signed an extradition warrant. Last week Mr Osman, in his seventh year in Brixton prison, failed to persuade the House of Lords to hear his latest plea against extradition to face 39 charges of fraud and theft related to the collapse of a property empire in 1983.</p>

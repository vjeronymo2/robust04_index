			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 960.7(b)(3) of the proposed rule provides that within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 30 calendar days of each Bank's approval of the AHP applications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for a given AHP funding cycle, the Bank shall forward to the Board  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a summary of each approved AHP application. The summary shall:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Briefly describe the project, including the applicant, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loan fund or loan consortium, if applicable, and the sponsor_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether nonprofit, for-profit or public agency, the type of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> housing, the location, the long-term period committed to, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of housing units including the number of units affordable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for very low-, low- or moderate-income households or for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> households at any other income levels committed to in the AHP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application, the development cost, other financing sources, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> special needs populations served;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) State the reason for the points awarded under each of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bank's scoring criteria for the project;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Indicate whether a subsidized advance or direct subsidy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was approved by the Bank for the project, the use of such funds,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the amount of such funds approved; if a subsidized advance was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved, the summary shall indicate the amount of the advance,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the advance rate, the amortization schedule for the advance, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> term to maturity, the applicable cost of funds, and the date as of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the cost of funds was determined;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Indicate whether the project received approval in a prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AHP funding cycle, or whether the project is an extension,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expansion, continuation or reconfiguration of a previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved AHP project;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Describe how the project will be monitored and by what  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entity;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) Describe the legal mechanisms to be used to ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance by the project with the long-term requirement contained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in &sect;960.5 of the proposed rule;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vii) Include a summary in chart form showing all AHP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications received by the Bank in the particular AHP funding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cycle, with the score each application received for each scoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criterion, and the total score received by each project; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (viii) Include any other information required by the Board.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board has general oversight responsibility over the AHP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under section 10(j) of the Act. See 12 U.S.C. 1430(j). In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, section 10(j)(12)(A) of the Act requires the Board to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitor and report annually to the Congress and the Advisory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Council for each Bank the support of low-income housing and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> community development by the Banks and the utilization of advances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for these purposes.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1430(j)(12)(A). Since the Board would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no longer be receiving and approving AHP applications under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule, the Board would no longer have these applications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a source of data to assist the Board in exercising its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oversight and monitoring responsibilities and preparing the annual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report to the Congress and the Advisory Councils. Accordingly,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Board will need the Banks to provide this additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information to the Board in the summary, as required in proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;960.7(b)(3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Requirements For Approval of AHP Applications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. General  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 960.8(a) of the proposed rule provides that each Bank  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall evaluate the AHP applications received to determine if they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfy the threshold criteria in proposed &sect;960.9. All  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications that meet the threshold criteria shall be scored  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pursuant to the criteria contained in proposed &sect;960.10 as set  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forth in the Bank's approved AHP implementation plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.8(b) of the proposed rule provides that the Bank  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall approve the applications in descending order starting with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the highest scoring application until the total AHP funding amount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the particular funding cycle, except for any amount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insufficient to fund the next highest scoring project, has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocated. The Bank also may approve the next four highest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scoring applications as alternates and, within one year of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approval by the Bank, may fund such alternates if any previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> committed AHP funds become available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Threshold Criteria for Approval of AHP Applications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 960.9 of the proposed rule provides that an AHP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application must meet all of the threshold criteria set forth in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. through f. below in order to be considered for scoring under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed &sect;960.10 and for AHP funding approval. These criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are discussed in detail below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Authorized and required uses requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The AHP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application must indicate that the use of the subsidized advance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or direct subsidy set forth in the AHP application for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed project will comply with the requirements for authorized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and required uses of such funds contained in proposed &sect;&sect;960.3,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 960.4 and 960.5. See proposed &sect;960.9(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed provision is consistent with the intent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;960.5(a)(1) of the Board's existing AHP regulation. See 12 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 960.5(a)(1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fair housing law requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The AHP application must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicate that the project sponsor will comply with any applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fair housing law requirements and must indicate how the sponsor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposes to affirmatively further compliance with such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements. See proposed &sect;960.9(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

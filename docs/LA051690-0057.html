			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SATICOY;  </P> <P> HOUSING AGENCY DIRECTOR HONORED  </P> <P> The director of a nonprofit housing agency in Saticoy has received a national  United Way award for developing low-income housing for county residents.  </P> <P> Rodney Fernandez, director of the Cabrillo Economic Development Corp., was one  of three people chosen to receive the annual award from a pool of more than  1,200 United Way recipients.  </P> <P> The Cabrillo Economic Development Corp. is one of the few recipients of United  Way funds to use the money to develop low-income housing, said Sylvia Schopp,  spokeswoman for the United Way of Ventura County.  </P> <P> "I hope this encourages other United Ways across the country to look more  seriously at spending money on low-income housing," Fernandez said.  </P> <P> "In the past, people in United Way have tended to look at housing as  complicated and costly projects," Fernandez said. "Now we have shown that we  can make their dollars work."  </P> <P> The Cabrillo Economic Development Corp. manages 10 housing projects countywide  and has developed more than 450 units.  </P> <P> The corporation, which has been a member of United Way since 1987, receives  about $50,000 a year from the agency.

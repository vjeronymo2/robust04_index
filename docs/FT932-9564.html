			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Letter: Mission statements that are too often short on reality Sir, Your article 'Men with a mission' (Management, May 10) was a very timely and appropriate comment on the state of the mission statement in British corporate life. There are three fundamental areas in which British companies fail to give mission statements the value and credibility they need: They are all too often written in 'management speak'; this may suit individuals at board level, but the further down the line one goes, the less relevant it is. It also has the effect, in most cases, of making a statement which is bland to the point of anonymity. The acid test must be that the company is still capable of being readily identified even if one crossed its name off the mission statement: surprisingly few of them pass that test at the moment. They are often sent out in a single form to all staff, and all staff are expected to relate to them in the same way (which, of course, is almost entirely impossible). They are not set out in a way which means that employees can relate them to their everyday tasks, and if they fail that test, it means that employees will have great difficulty in relating to the mission statement at all. British management seems to have accepted the idea of the mission statement without necessarily being able to turn it into a reality. A mission statement is a beginning and not an end.

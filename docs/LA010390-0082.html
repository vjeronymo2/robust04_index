			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EAST BLOC IN TRANSITION;  </P> <P> HAVEL VISITS 2 GERMANYS, OKS UNITY;  </P> <P> EUROPE: THE NEW CZECH PRESIDENT SEES NO NEED TO FEAR A REUNITED GERMANY SO LONG  AS IT IS DEMOCRATIC.  </P> <P> Czechoslovakia's new President Vaclav Havel, on a quick trip to the two  Germanys, declared Tuesday that Europe need have no fear of a reunited Germany  -- so long as it is democratic.  </P> <P> Havel, who assumed the presidency last Friday, met with East German leaders in  East Berlin and told reporters afterward that Germany "can be as large as it  wants."  </P> <P> He also made a surprise visit to the Berlin Wall, at the Brandenburg Gate, and  said he was "amazed that the wall was still standing." According to Havel, the  acting East German head of state, Manfred Gerlach, said that the wall soon will  be coming down.  </P> <P> "I told him that if he had any problems we could send some independent  Czechoslovak workers to help -- free of charge," Havel added.  </P> <P> Gerlach also told the West German newspaper Bild that the wall will soon come  down. "We are dismantling it," the newspaper quoted Gerlach as saying. "It has  become superfluous. It will be replaced by ordinary border markers."  </P> <P> Bild said Gerlach had not set a date for tearing down the wall, but had  indicated that the matter will be taken up soon by his government.  </P> <P> Havel said that the two Germanys should not decide on their future until after  the euphoria brought on by their recently acquired freedom dies down, and he  added that they should decide in consultation with the rest of Europe.  </P> <P> "Democratic awareness and a democratic system," he said, "are more important  than the possibility that it might become one nation of 60 or 80 million  people."  </P> <P> Havel, accompanied by Prime Minister Marian Calfa and Foreign Minister Jiri  Deinstbier, spent four hours in East Berlin, talking with Prime Minister Hans  Modrow and other officials, before flying to Munich and a meeting with West  German President Richard von Weizsaecker and Chancellor Helmut Kohl.  </P> <P> Kohl said he looks for good relations between Bonn and Prague and went on to  say, "When I look at the weather here in Munich today -- bright sunshine -- it  is a good omen for the 1990s that are now beginning."  </P> <P> He said there would be no concrete agreements in his meeting with Havel and  that "the most important thing today is getting to know one another."  </P> <P> Havel, a popular hero of the November uprising that brought down  Czechoslovakia's Communist leadership, said he expects East Germany and West  Germany to agree on their future and that "it must be part of a whole European  process."  </P> <P> "It must be worked out by negotiations, not through wild gestures," he said.  "Much of Czechoslovakia borders on East or West Germany; Germany virtually  surrounds us. It must free its neighbors of fear, specifically the fear of a  greater Germany."  </P></p>

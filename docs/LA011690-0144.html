			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NIBBLES AND BITS  </P> <P> The anticipated cable television premiere of "Secret Passions," a gay-oriented  soap opera under production in Orange County, has been postponed from Jan. 23  to Feb. 1, the show's producer said Monday. The postponement will be to  accommodate plans for a kickoff press party for the show, which is being aimed  at leased-access cable channels, producer David Gadberry said. A pilot has been  completed, but no more episodes are finished, and as of Monday afternoon  Gadberry said he had not sent the pilot to any cable stations and could not  confirm that any channels will air it on his targeted launch date.  </P></p>

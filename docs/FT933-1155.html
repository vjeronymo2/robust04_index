			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Congress set for crime crackdown CONGRESS may act to combat crime as early as next month following the formal introduction this week of crime legislation in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. The legislation proposes limits on the right to habeas corpus appeals, new forms of punishment such as military-style 'boot camps' for young offenders and authorisation of funding for another 50,000 police officers. The House version of the bill includes the so-called Brady bill, designed to curb sales of handguns by imposing a five-day waiting period. Both bills propose a largely symbolic expansion of the federal death penalty, but drop a proposal for executing 'drug kingpins' because of doubts about its constitutionality. President Bill Clinton yesterday rallied support for crime legislation in Florida, which has one of the highest rates of violent crime in the US and has been the scene of a string of recent killings of tourists. He argued for boot camps, community policing and gun control. 'These are things we have to do. These three things are preventive, and they're worth a pound of cure. 'There's no use in us pretending that some national government programme and money alone will fix it, but there's no use in us pretending that just preaching at people will fix it either,' he said. Congressional legislation on crime usually turns into an opportunity for politicians to show their constituents how tough they are. It also tends to have little effect, because most crime is the responsibility of state and local governments.</p>

The same thing is happening with money in circulation, which is  increasing by more than 35 percent.    Fenalco [National Federation of Businessmen] warned of the  serious risk of a new heating up of inflation during the coming  months as a consequence of the increase in the amount of money  in circulation, the rates charged for services provided by the  state, and the obligations imposed by the social security reform.    "Realistically, it seems likely that in 1994 the IPC  [Consumer Price Index] will have a higher rate of increase  because of a number of factors," said a Fenalco statement.    In its end-of-the-year report, Fenalco maintains that  inflation's downward trend is still far from certain. "If foods  are excluded, the annualized inflation rate remains at 27  percent."    According to Fenalco, the prices of goods and services  provided by the state continue to rise sharply. In addition,  money in circulation is increasing by over 35 percent.    The business association also cites the fiscal deficit and  the rise in public spending as causes of inflation, along with  labor costs created by the social security reform, which  readjusts the payments that businesses and users must make to  the ISS [Social Security Institute].    "Fenalco cannot be as optimistic about inflation in 1994 as  the government is."  <H5>  No Slowdown in Trade Liberalization </H5>   Fenalco said that a too great delay of trade liberalization  would be a historic error on the part of the next president of  Colombia. This process has become essential for the nation's  progress in the next century, if it wants to move ahead of the  group of medium- and lower-income countries.    Another immediate challenge, says Fenalco, is stabilizing  the  economy to bring the annual inflation rate down to one-digit  levels within a maximum of three or four years.    According to the business group, the next government cannot  continue the policy of excessive, deficit-based public spending,  nor can it slacken in the area of monetary discipline.    The report adds that accelerating devaluation to stimulate  exports "is not a consistent and serious policy."    Concerning foreign investment in Colombia, Fenalco's  president, Sabas Pretel de la Vega, said that although Pablo  Escobar's death has created a better environment, Colombia still  has many weaknesses and risks that deter foreign investment.    The association report includes numbers on business growth.  According to these statistics, during the first eight months of  1993 retail sales rose 3.8 percent.    Although automotive sales have increased, sales of imported  vehicles declined during the last two months of 1993, as the  dealers waited for next year's new models.</p>

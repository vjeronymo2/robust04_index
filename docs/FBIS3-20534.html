			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Not Everything Is Coming Up Roses"] </F>   [Text] In recent years, in the wake of China's continuous  reform and open up, many foreign businesses have come to China  to invest and open factories and so on. Nationwide, the three  kinds of wholly and partially foreign-owned enterprises have  emerged like "bamboo shoots after a spring rain." They have  become an indispensable part of our symphony of reform and  opening up.    But there are a few discordant notes in this symphony.  <H5>  Profit Is Being Shifted Elsewhere </H5>   A certain province once examined its 1,090 FFEs' income tax  and found that 544 were losing money to a tune of 327 million  yuan, with losses extending to 50 percent of the FFEs.    Why are these FFEs losing money? There are many reasons. It  is learned that many of the foreign investors in the FFEs often  use prices to shift their profit around and artificially jack up  their cost to eat up our side's profit, creating book-losses to  take advantage of the state's tax exemption or reduction  benefits.    According to one tax department, in 1990, a foreign business  came to China to set up a limited liability company jointly with  a township enterprise in the garment business. This foreign  company had sales channels abroad, and the high quality suits  made by the joint venture cost about 150 yuan to produce, but  the foreign staff paid only 110 yuan a piece and sold them  through their retail network abroad. Internally, they said it  was because of the market slump which forced them to cut price.  As a result, for each suit we sold, we lost approximately 40  yuan. The company's Chinese manager even went to the tax  department to ask for a tax reduction or exemption (in fact,  even the Chinese manager was deceived by those people).    Supposedly, in this kind of situation where more production  and sales only bring more losses should prompt the enterprises  to readjust their product mix and change their management  thinking. But the other side do not care, and in fact the more  money we lose, the more they step up production. It is only  after a period of time that the tax department gets suspicious  and sends people out to investigate and then the whole act is  exposed, and the Chinese side eventually recovers millions in  tax revenue and lost profit.  <H5>  The Funds Fail To Come Through </H5>   Among some FFEs, often times the foreign funds fail to come  through on time if at all, and as a result, some enterprises are  forced to take out large loans from the domestic banks. In  1986, a certain Chinese hotel negotiated with a foreign company  to jointly set up a hotel here with total investment of $15  million, each side controlling 50 percent of the stocks. But  more than a year later, the foreign partner still could not  deliver all the money, nor could they come up with the foreign  unguaranteed loans it had agreed to in the contract. The  building project has become just an empty promise.    In the years that followed, the Chinese side waited and made  concessions. In November of 1990, the Chinese side put up 10  million yuan of the 52.296 million yuan the old hotel was valued  at to buy more shares and lent the remaining 42.296 million yuan  to the other side in the form of an extra investment. Thus the  Chinese side, so proud and eager to get into this joint venture  to build a new hotel, ended up throwing in the old building too.  But that was not all. In order to complete this joint-venture  hotel as soon as possible and get the utilities and roads ready  and purchase some electricity bonds, the Chinese side even threw  in a 16 million yuan loan they had raised on their own.  Remodeling the old building cost them all of their 5.64 million  yuan of the registered capital plus a 20 million yuan RMB loan  from a domestic bank the Chinese side took out a loan in the  name of the joint venture. To date, the foreign partner's  unguaranteed loan still has not shown up, and there is no point  talking about the new hotel.    Today, interest payments alone cost the joint venture hotel  more than 5 million yuan a year. The Chinese side is stuck. What  will the final outcome be? Who knows.    How come the foreign capital often fails to come through?  Some people hit the nail in the head when they point out that,  first, certain foreign businesses have very poor credit and do  not have much money of their own, and no foreign bank would lend  them money.    Second, some foreign business have no serious intention of  cooperating and never expect to come up with their own money;  they only want to use the joint venture to borrow money from  China. Third, the contract terms are not tight enough and are  not enforced vigorously; there is no deadline for delivering the  money, leaving a loophole for the foreign businesses to take  advantage of. Fourth, from the time the contracts are signed to  the time of their execution, the exchange rates have changed,  which can affect the foreign business's timely payment. Lastly,  the Chinese side often makes mistakes.  <H5>  Making Money by Importing Equipment </H5>   Study shows that currently many FFEs are importing their  major pieces of equipment and raw materials (or the foreign  companies are importing them as their share of the investment),  and since the Chinese side is not familiar with the foreign  markets, most importing is naturally handled singlehandedly by  the foreign businesses who simply take advantage of this  weakness to make money off of the equipment and raw materials.  Incomplete data compiled by a relevant department for Yunnan,  Jiangsu, Fujian, Tianjin, Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Jiangxi  showed that machinery and equipment reported as foreign  investments worth $68.8643 million were appraised by the  Commodities Inspection Administration to be worth $52.3463  million. They have overstated the value by $16.6857 million, or  24 percent. In some cases, they have overstated the value of a  single piece of equipment by 12.7 times, which is most shocking.  Sometimes they substitute old equipment for new or inferior  quality for good to cheat the Chinese side.    There is another kind of foreign businessmen who have  neither  capital nor real technical qualifications; their standard is far  below that of some of our domestic enterprises, but they have  come all the way to China to work on joint ventures. They  neither provide money nor talent, but they take advantage of the  fact that the Chinese don't know how to get into the  international markets, and they just help us sell some goods. Do  you call that joint venture? It is but a typical business  relationship, but some people willingly let them take away our  profit.  <H5>  Getting Out of the Swamp </H5>   In more than a decade of reform and opening up, the FFEs  have  played a valuable role. This we must acknowledge. But some  domestic enterprises that went into a joint venture just for its  own sake have paid dearly for the lesson. The relevant  departments should be concerned.    One, some domestic enterprises must correct their guiding  ideology with respect to "joint ventures." They must take  responsibility for what they do. Two, the relevant department  must promptly formulate and perfect the laws and regulations  that not only protect our rights but also the foreign investors'  enthusiasm and plug all loopholes at the same time, so that the  FFEs can embark on a healthy developmental track. Three, before  getting into a joint venture, domestic enterprises must go  through different channels to investigate and get to know the  other side. They must have a good grasp of the foreign  business's ability to fulfill their contracts and their business  reputation and demand that they provide proof of their  credibility. Four, we must perfect the contract terms and leave  no loophole for others to take advantage of. Five, relevant  personnel must study hard and learn more about international  economics and finance and business in particular, and they must  find ways to obtain international market price information on  equipment and raw materials and so on, so that foreign  businesses cannot give us false information.</p>

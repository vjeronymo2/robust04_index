			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOOKING AHEAD: CHANGING FACE OF SUPERMARKETS  </P> <P> It has been said that no institution in the United States tells us as much  about ourselves as the supermarket.  </P> <P> The graying of America, the move toward a service-oriented economy, the  emergence of new ethnic groups and the expanding role of women in the labor  market have all had an impact on the supermarket shelf.  </P> <P> Today, the leading supermarkets tell us that consumers are no longer dominated  by national brands or tastes.  </P> <P> In the 1990s, new consumer tastes and life styles are only the most visible of  the changes that are rewriting the rules for the supermarket business. What was  once the conventional supermarket will, before the decade is over, become quite  unconventional by today's standards. Already these stores are being challenged  by such competitors as hypermarkets, wholesale clubs, discount stores and  grocery-outlet stores. Hypermarkets are huge, combination discount-retail and  grocery stores.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, manufacturers can no longer depend on "national" tastes to support  national brands. Changing demographics, ethnic population bases and life styles  all have helped make the mass market less relevant. Now, regional -- even local  -- tastes and economics are more important in the food industry than in perhaps  any other retailing business. This helps to explain why few American  supermarket chains can compete successfully in several metropolitan markets and  why chains such as A&amp;P, Safeway and Kroger have pulled out of many cities  while focusing on particular regions. Simultaneously, such companies as  Albertson's, Vons and Ralphs have developed several formats to fit local market  conditions and real estate economics.  </P> <P> Apart from changes in consumer tastes, two other factors have played a strong  role in regionalization in recent years. The first is higher freight and  distribution costs. Because of deregulation of the trucking industry and the  reduced control of unions over distribution centers, retailers can serve  regional areas economically, but they have a harder time maintaining warehouses  in several parts of the country. And as stores turn over more space to  perishable items -- seafood counters, salad bars, delis, bakeries and flower  shops -- distribution centers that can respond faster and more frequently have  become even more important.  </P> <P> A second change driving regional concentration has been advertising. In the  1980s, the costs of conventional advertising (TV, radio, newspapers) increased  faster than the supermarket industry's ability to raise prices. This has forced  retailers to concentrate stores in large urban areas to get the most out of  their advertising dollar. The loss of many TV viewers to cable and VCRs also  has made national advertising campaigns less cost effective.  </P> <P> If they are to survive and prosper in this new retailing world, manufacturers  and retailers will have to find the best ways to reach target markets and to  customize not only products but also packaging, pricing, promotions and support  systems. And while retailers are trying to respond even faster to consumer  whims, they will have to keep perishable inventories to a minimum.  </P> <P> The only way to do all this effectively will be through technology. Retailers  are just beginning to tap the full potential of their investment in  technologies such as scanning equipment and warehouse information systems.  Besides ringing up the price of an item on the cash register, scanners will  provide detailed receipts, eliminating cashier mistakes and letting customers  review individual prices and ask for subtotals. Scanners also will give store  managers minute-by-minute details of purchases and automatically generate  orders to replenish stock.  </P> <P> At the same time, the complex information and management systems installed in  the 1990s will help stores improve operating performance and return on assets.  Often these systems will be tied into suppliers' systems to cut costs and  increase efficiency.  </P> <P> Much of the information generated by scanners, as well as other information,  will be fed into another form of technology: electronic data interchange (EDI).  A $300 delivery of potato chips may require the same paper work as a $30,000  warehouse delivery, so using EDI to exchange ordering, billing, shipping and  receiving information among retailers and suppliers will return significant  benefits, particularly in the elimination or improvement of time-consuming,  error-producing clerical work.  </P> <P> EDI will also find a use in the home. It has been estimated that by the  mid-1990s, one-third of all grocery shopping will be done through interactive  home videotext communications devices, with payment via a debit card. EDI  systems will create the networks that provide banking and at-home (even in-car)  shopping services.  </P> <P> As retailers use scanners and EDI systems to build elaborate federations of  linked companies and meet customers' changing needs and tastes, food  manufacturers will be forced to go along. They will have to invest in the  technologies that allow them to participate in these federations.  </P> <P> In sum, the burden has shifted. Retailers that survived the restructuring of  the food industry in the 1980s are stronger and more sophisticated. They will  control the 1990s. Manufacturers, who used to simply offer products and expect  retailers to find shelf space for them, will also have to develop strategies  for different markets and population groups, increase marketing expenses to  support those strategies and invest in the technology required to meet  retailers' -- and consumers' -- needs.  </P></p>

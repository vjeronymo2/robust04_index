			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Marginal momentum Eighteen months ago, margins at the UK's big food retailers appeared on the verge of collapse under a new wave of pricing pressure from discounters. Tesco's interim figures show such fears were misplaced. It held the year-on-year decline in gross margins to 0.1 per cent in the first half, following a drop of 0.7 per cent in the second half of 1993. Like-for-like sales rose by 4 per cent, further evidence that Tesco's strategy for fending off the threat from the discounters has been effective - so far. Tesco has responded to the challenge by cutting prices of key products, putting pressure on suppliers and improving operating efficiency, tactics also adopted by J. Sainsbury. These steps could not have eliminated the intense competitive pressures in the sector, but they appear to have shifted some of those pressures back on to the discounters themselves. Judging by Shoprite's profits warning this summer, problems at Lo-Cost, the Argyll subsidiary, and analysts' scaled back expectations for Kwik Save, low prices alone have failed to make really damaging inroads into the big retailers' territory. That said, market conditions are far removed from the second half of the 1980s when margins climbed at a comfortable 1 per cent a year. In a low-inflation environment dogged by overcapacity, it will be a struggle to preserve margins at existing levels. The sector has risen against the market by 20 per cent in the last six months. Further outperformance on this scale is unlikely.</p>

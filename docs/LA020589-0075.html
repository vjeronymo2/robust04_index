			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CATS IN CAIRO  </P> <P> "Cat's Meow Drives Cairo to Distraction" (Part I, Jan. 24) -- a most  interesting article -- but with a little misinformation.  </P> <P> Cats may not be held in the same high regard today as they were once by some  Egyptians, but Egyptians who own pets are pet lovers. Just ask any camel, dog  or cat. Numerous shops in the bazaar of Cairo have their own cat -- and they  are well-groomed and fat.  </P> <P> Along the Nile, horse-drawn carriages all have clover for the horses. Every  camel, every animal of the field, all are well-fed, washed daily and all are  considered a member of the family.  </P> <P> As for the "kitten on the keys" who disrupted the piano recital. I read this  portion of your report to my own cat, an Abyssinian (who thinks she is  descended from early Egyptian cats -- a fact yet to be verified) and she  reminded me that centuries ago many Egyptians believed in reincarnation. Many  of those who left their first life returned -- and in many cases -- returned as  a cat.  </P> <P> The kitten at the piano recital was not a stray intruder -- not a prowler in  the night. That kitten, as my cat reminded me, was probably a music critic in  its former life.  </P> <P> Martin Bernheimer, take note!  </P> <P> ROBERT BRANDON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

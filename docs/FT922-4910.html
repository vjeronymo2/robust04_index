			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / International Company News: Dassault attacks orders for US aircraft WESTERN European governments should be obliged to buy European defence equipment or see their defence industries wither, Mr Serge Dassault, chairman of Dassault Aviation, the French maker of jet fighters and business aircraft, said yesterday, writes William Dawkins. In an article in a French newspaper, Mr Dassault, whose company has not received a military aircraft export order for four years, attacked Finland and Switzerland for recently buying American F-18s, competitors to the Dassault Mirage 2000-5. 'European preference must be absolute, not just for countries in the European Community, but also for those who want to join it, like for example, Finland and Switzerland, which decide to equip their air forces with an American aircraft. One cannot measure the considerable damage caused by the non-observance of this rule . . . Every time a European country chooses American equipment instead of European equipment, Europe shrinks,' he wrote. The only exceptions to a general preference for European suppliers must be for equipment that cannot be developed there, just as the US government only seeks European defence equipment if it cannot be made in the US, he argued. Dassault has been badly hit by the squeeze on the French defence budget, intensifying pressure on it to seek export markets. Net profits fell by 29 per cent last year, to FFr263.9m, on turnover down 15 per cent to FFr15.9bn. The group also makes Falcon executive aircraft, but military sales still accounted for 75 per cent of last year's FFr15.9bn, a proportion which Dassault is aiming to reduce to 55 per cent.</p>

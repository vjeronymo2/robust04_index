			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / International Company News: EIB lending to reach Ecu19bn The European Investment Bank said the volume of its borrowing and lending next year could be adversely affected by slower growth in public sector infrastructure spending in western Europe. At a presentation in London, Mr Pit Treumann, a senior EIB official responsible for lending throughout the European Union, said the bank's lending and borrowing were 'demand-driven'. If factors like the move towards privatisation in several countries slowed down demand for infrastructure financing, this would influence the EIB's need for funds on capital markets, he said. The EIB now ranks as the most active international development institution, with its operations exceeding those of the World Bank. This year it will sign agreements to lend an overall Ecu19bn, 90 per cent within the EU, although disbursements are a smaller figure. This compares with lending commitments of Ecu16bn in 1992. Because of the uncertainties over the outlook for 1994, the bank has not yet assessed the likely size of its borrowing and lending operations for next year, though it is due to draw up a forecast this month. The bank has borrowed Ecu14bn on different markets so far this year, with the largest component - around 16 per cent of the total - in sterling. The scope of the bank's activities has been increased by decisions by European heads of government for the EIB to step up funding for transport, telecommunications and energy projects. Sir Brian Unwin, chairman, said: 'There is certainly a case for extending the facility' in the light of the recession in much of the continent. Since the end of 1992, the EIB has been given a remit to provide an extra Ecu7bn for such projects in addition to its normal lending. Loans of Ecu3.5bn for the extra projects have been approved with the total expected to reach Ecu4.5bn by the year end.</p>

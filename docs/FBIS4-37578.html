			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yerah Tal] </F>   [Excerpt] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres decided to call  off a gathering of his supporters scheduled for today after  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin appointed him to head the  negotiations with Syria, a very senior Labor figure stated  yesterday.    According to this source, in the meeting the two men held  yesterday Peres asserted that Rabin had largely blocked the  Syrian channel to him. Peres told the prime minister that U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher had called off his visit  to the region because he reached the conclusion that there had  been no progress in the Syrian channel and that a mission under  such circumstances would be doomed to failure. Peres stressed  to Rabin that he could promote the negotiations and complete  them within a few months.    Following these assertions, Rabin notified Peres of his  decision to place him in charge of the negotiations with Syria.  This decision paved the way to settling their dispute, and  shortly afterward Peres informed the media that the gathering of  his supporters had been canceled.    Peres said that he and Rabin were jointly steering the  entire  peace process, including the Syrian channel, and denied that he  had voiced any complaints on the issue to Rabin. Nevertheless,  a senior source associated with Peres confirmed that Rabin  appointed the foreign minister to head the talks with Syria.  However, the source noted, Rabin's move was not related to  Peres' decision to call off the gathering of his supporters.    The conversation held by Rabin and Peres, some of which was  attended by Labor Secretary General Nisim Zvili, allayed the  turmoil in the Labor Knesset faction. The meeting of the  faction yesterday afternoon was very relaxed, and none of the  participants attacked the prime minister and criticized what has  been happening in the party. The brief session ended after the  faction endorsed Knesset Member Eli Goldschmidt's proposal to  put off a debate on postponing the implementation or abrogating  the law on the direct election of the prime minister to a later  date, until the situation in the party calmed down.

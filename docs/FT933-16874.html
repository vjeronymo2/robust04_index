			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Speedy return on RTZ's move into US coal RTZ CORPORATION, the world's biggest mining group, has already sold the three gold and silver mines it acquired in February when it made a Dollars 470m (Pounds 313m) move into the US coal business with the acquisition of Nerco, the floundering natural resources company owned by PacifiCorp. Ironically, the recent rise in the gold price started by the high-profile activities of Mr George Soros and Sir James Goldsmith helped to speed RTZ's disposals, which will bring in at least Dollars 40m. Also Nerco had decided to dispose of its precious metals mines before being acquired by RTZ. In 1992 Nerco recorded pre-tax provisions of Dollars 310.2m to write down the assets to estimated net realisable value and to provide for disposal costs and estimated operating losses to the date of disposal. Minorco, the Luxembourg-quoted overseas investment arm of the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa, is paying Dollars 21m cash for Nerco's Pikes Peak Mining Company, which owns 80 per cent of the Cripple Creek mine in Colorado. This mine last year produced 42,000 troy ounces of gold and 12,000 ounces of silver and has 1.4m ounces of gold in its reserves. Kinross Gold, a US company formed from the merger of Plexus Resources, CMP Resources and 1021105 Ontario Corporation, is paying Dollars 16.8m cash for Nerco's DeLamar gold-silver mine in south-west Idaho and the Candelaria silver mine in western Nevada. DeLamar produced 38,000 ounces of gold and 1.82m ounces of silver last year. Reserves include 787,000 ounces of gold and 17.5m ounces of silver. Mining operations at Candelaria were suspended in November 1990 because its reserves were almost exhausted, but ore processing continued and the mine produced 2,000 ounces of gold and 1m ounces of silver last year. The sale to Kinross also includes the American Mine gold prospect in California and the Dunka Road base metal mine in northern Minnesota. Nerco has also agreed in principle to sell its Con mine in the Northwest Territories of Canada to Red Lion Management, a Vancouver-based conglomerate. No price has been revealed so far for Con, a deep underground gold mine which produced 120,000 ounces of the metal last year and has more than 1.1m ounces in reserves. The sale includes 16,700 acres of mineral interests around the mine in the city of Yellowknife of which only 12 per cent has been explored.</p>

			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Pressure grows on ITV over news slot POLITICAL opposition to the ITV companies' plans to move News at Ten to the early evening is likely to increase this week. The government has made clear its displeasure over the proposed move and has warned that it may refuse to allow any latitude over the future ownership of television news organisations. Under the 1990 Broadcasting Act 51 per cent of ITN has to move to non-ITV ownership by the end of 1994. Following the ITN reorganisation earlier this year which brought in Reuters as a shareholder, the remaining ITV owners thought the government could be persuaded to change its mind. They hoped that bringing in another outside shareholder, such as a US network, would be seen as an acceptable level of outside investment and that the ITV shareholders - Carlton, Central, London Weekend, Granada, Scottish and Anglia - would be allowed to retain control. It is now being made clear by Downing Street that if News at Ten disappears, and with it the platform it often gives the Commons for historic votes live on air between 10pm and 10.30pm, the letter of the Broadcasting Act on ITN ownership would be enforced. ITV wants to move News at Ten to 6.30pm or 7pm because its present slot interrupts films and drama beginning after the 9pm 'adult' watershed and because of what it sees as increasing competition from Channel 4. The Broadcasting Act took away the power of the Independent Television Commission to set specific time slots for programmes although the ITC plans to do everything it can to block the move. Some people in ITV would also like to remove the ITN brand name from its bulletins on ITV and just give it a credit at the end like any other programme supplier.</p>

			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / UK Company News: NatWest gives Swiss role in search for rich pickings - The expansion plans of Coutts &amp; Co in a competitive market THERE IS no shortage of bankers for the rich these days, especially in Switzerland. But National Westminster Bank, through its Coutts &amp; Co subsidiary, is making a fresh bid to become one of the leading companies in this niche market. Over the past two years, NatWest has reorganised its international private banking activities, combining three subsidiaries into one new organisation, Coutts &amp; Co AG, based in Zurich. Mr Jean Pierre Cuoni, the Swiss banker who heads the operation, says one of his main strategies for growth is to build on the NatWest customer base. 'In theory, we should serve every NatWest client who becomes a millionaire,' he says. It was Mr Cuoni who encouraged the rationalisation of the NatWest international private banking business. He was hired in 1988 to find a new focus for Zurich-based HandelsBank NatWest, then a full service Swiss bank which NatWest bought from Nestle in 1975. The bank had been strong in corporate and securities lines, but the prospects for a foreign-owned bank in these businesses in the late 1980s did not look promising. Mr Cuoni, who had spent 28 years with Citicorp, mainly in the private banking area in Switzerland, suggested HandelsBank should concentrate on building up its private banking business. 'However, there were already Coutts' international operations and NatWest International Trust Holdings in this field. It was hardly optimal to have three managements, three brand names and three strategies going after the same market.' In a move that surprised many, NatWest announced early last year that it would put all three in a new organisation under Mr Cuoni's control with headquarters in Zurich, and 17 offices in other world capitals and tax havens. 'Switzerland is still the centre of cross border international private banking,' Mr Cuoni says, pointing out that the bulk of the money that flowed out of the Middle East at the time of the Gulf war went to Switzerland. He believes that the Coutts name and the Swiss knowhow will prove a winning combination. With more than Pounds 11bn under management, the group is closing on the biggest Swiss private banks. But it is still far behind the big three universal banks, Union Bank of Switzerland, Swiss Bank Corporation and Credit Suisse in this area. Profits are not disclosed but Mr Cuoni says, 'we are making good money'. He acknowledges that Coutts is seeking to grow in difficult times. 'At the moment, few big fortunes are being created. There are no great flows of funds as there were in the 1970s. Within a few years, it will start to come from eastern Europe, but now if you want to build your business, you have to take market share from others.' As a result, competition is getting much tougher. Mr Cuoni believes that ultimately only a dozen banks will survive with a worldwide role in international private banking. 'It is expensive to be in this business. You need extremely good investment management products and technology, and that all requires heavy investment.' Promotion too is expensive in this rarefied market. This year, the 300th anniversary of the founding of Coutts, the bank will establish the Coutts Art Foundation in Zurich to promote contemporary artists. And what about suggestions that Switzerland is losing its attractiveness for the rich of the world? 'I think there is an awareness here that the future battle will be won on performance, not on the advantages of location. Still, Switzerland has a head start, with something like half of the cross border private banking business in the world. 'The Swiss are absolute market leaders in delivery of fast and error free service. That is what the clients want, so I am fairly optimistic about Switzerland as the epicentre.'</p>

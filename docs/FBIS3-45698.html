			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, January 20 (XINHUA) -- Russian Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin stressed on Thursday [20 January]  the need to curb the inflation, the "biggest problem" for the  country.    Speaking at a news conference held here on Thursday  afternoon, Chernomyrdin said his government expects inflation to  run at 15-18 percent a month for the first half of 1994, and  12-14 percent for the second half of the year, falling to  perhaps 8-9 percent monthly by the end of the year.    "Inflation is and remains the biggest problem" in Russia, he  pointed out, noting: "Everything else depends on curbing the  biggest problem."    The inflation rate has wavered up or down 20 percent in the  country in the past months.    The government head stressed: "Inflation in Russia no longer  depends on the activity of one or another government official."  It is "now fluctuating on its own inertia," he added.    Chernomyrdin said attempts at financial stabilization were  being undermined by two things: on the one hand, the structure  of the economy and structural problems which have led to  stagnant investment rates and a decline in production, and on  the other hand, federal organs of power which sometimes make  promises which are impossible to fulfil.    He told reporters that the newly-formed cabinet proposed to  "correct the course of reforms." According to him, the essence  of the correction in the fight against inflation will be that --  "we will move from primarily monetaristic tactics to  non-monetaristic ones, which have been used in many European  countries."    The head of the Russian Government specified that this means  the foundation of a real competitive market in the Russian  economy. "That is, in fact, a step towards an increasingly open  Russian market. All artificial barriers to the entry of foreign  investments and goods into Russia will be removed."    He also stressed that the "president's course of deep and  democratic reforms in the Russian society has been, is, and will  be consistently pursued."    At the news conference, the prime minister read out the list  of the new Russian Government signed by President Boris Yeltsin.    In the new line-up, Chernomyrdin has one first deputy --  Oleg  Soskovets, and three deputies -- Aleksandr Zaveryukha, Anatoliy  Chubays, and Yuriy Yarov.    He also listed names of ministers. But the final government  reshuffle has not finished completely, well-informed sources  here said.    In order to raise the government's effectiveness, the number  of its members was reduced from 93 to 29, the sources confirmed.</p>

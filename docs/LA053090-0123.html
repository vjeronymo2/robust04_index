			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SEAL BEACH CREATES HOUSING PANEL  </P> <P> The City Council voted unanimously Tuesday night to appoint a citizens  committee to review a recently approved housing plan to see if revisions are  necessary.  </P> <P> The committee was proposed by Councilwoman Marilyn Bruce Hastings, who took  office May 15.  </P> <P> Each of the five council members may appoint up to four residents to the  committee, which will study details of the city's strategy for dealing with  future housing needs. Changes recommended by the committee will be considered  by the Planning Commission and the City Council, if necessary.  </P> <P> In March, a judge blocked Seal Beach from approving major residential projects  because the city's state-mandated housing plan was obsolete. The state requires  the plan to be updated every five years, and Seal Beach failed to submit its  new plan by last summer's deadline.  </P> <P> The outgoing City Council approved a new version of the plan during a meeting  May 10 that lasted past midnight. Hastings is critical of that plan, saying it  "has many inconsistencies."  </P> <P> The council also voted Tuesday to conclude public hearings and end meetings by  midnight unless a majority of the council wants either of them to last longer.  The guidelines, proposed by Hastings, were in response to the council's  marathon meetings earlier this month that lasted as late as 4:30 a.m.  </P> <P> "It's just not good business practice" to conduct business at those hours,  Hastings said.  </P> <P> The council opened a public hearing Tuesday to consider Mola Development  Corp.'s controversial plan to build a 329-unit project on the Old Hellman Ranch  property but was expected to continue that hearing to a special meeting later  this week or until the next regular council meeting June 13.  </P> <P> Mola's option to purchase the property for the $200-million project expires  Friday.  </P></p>

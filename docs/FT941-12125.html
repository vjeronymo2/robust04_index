			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Rover unleashed Even five years ago the idea that Rover and BMW were complementary marques would have been laughable. Yet now BMW's purchase of Rover looks like a very smart deal. The Bavarian carmaker gets the four-wheel drive technology it lacks and the most famous off-road brand name in the world. Once Land and Range Rovers start selling through BMW's North American dealerships, the volumes generated should test the capacity of the Solihull plant. While the main Rover and BMW brands will be managed separately, savings in buying and development and the sharing of overheads in the distribution network should make Rover very attractive. From British Aerospace's standpoint, the Pounds 800m sale price is higher than could have been achieved through a flotation. It also frees Pounds 900m of working capital which gives BAe plenty of options. The stronger balance sheet reinforces its position as a prime contractor in defence. Writing off around Pounds 200m of leases on its turbo-prop aircraft seems now almost certain, which will in turn will make it easier to find a joint venture partner for the business. Talks with Fokker on merging regional jet businesses could also get under way. Rationalisation of the defence business to increase margins - so far not even mooted - becomes possible. But for all the increased flexibility, did BAe get full value for Rover? The price of around 0.2 times sales is in line with the quoted price of many large carmakers, but no premium is being paid for control. Perhaps BAe might have kept a minority equity stake to get the benefit of any success Rover and BMW enjoy. Still, the certainty of a deal done is worth a lot, as Vickers found out when it tried and failed to sell Rolls-Royce Motors. BAe's new management has made good use of the opportunities it has found for itself, so the flexibility should not be squandered. And at last we know why Mr George Simpson, Rover's chairman, decided to stay on at BAe for six months before taking the helm at Lucas in April.</p>

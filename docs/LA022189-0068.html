			<p><P> February 21, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY EARNINGS: VALENCIA'S HUNTWAY PARTNERS LOSES $441,000 IN 4TH QUARTER  </P> <P> Huntway Partners, a Valencia producer of liquid asphalt and other oil-based  products, said it lost $441,000 in the fourth quarter compared with a  year-earlier profit of $1.58 million.  </P> <P> The loss came on a 27% drop in revenue to $17.9 million from $24.5 million,  Huntway said. The company is organized as a master limited partnership whose  ownership units, which are similar to shares of stock, began trading publicly  last November.  </P> <P> Huntway blamed the loss on a sharp drop in prices of crude oil products during  the quarter, which shaved the company's profit margins.  </P> <P> For all of 1988, however, Huntway's profit rose 40% to $3.16 million from $2.25  million, despite a drop in revenue to $82.8 million from $97.5 million.  </P></p>

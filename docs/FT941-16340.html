			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Treasury rules out model sale The Treasury has decided against privatising its computer model used in economic forecasting, after more than a year of feasibility discussions, Peter Marsh writes. The decision, announced yesterday, was greeted as 'disappointing but understandable' by DRI, the US-owned economics consultancy which last April declared its interest in running the model. Some economists have criticised faults in the model as being partly responsible for poor Treasury forecasts in recent years. Few UK economic consultancies said they were interested in taking over the model because the work might be too complex and not profitable enough. The Treasury said its decision had followed a recommendation by KPMG Peat Marwick, the consultancy.</p>

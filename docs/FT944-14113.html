			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Management (The Growing Business): GLE back in black with Pounds 1.9m profit - In a Nutshell Greater London Enterprise, the development agency owned by 13 London boroughs which has been restructuring for two years, last week reported profits of Pounds 1.9m in the year to 31 March, compared with a loss of Pounds 2m the previous year. Nearly half the operating profit came from the investments made by its venture capital arm, GLE Development Capital, using the group's own funds. These investments are slowly being liquidated. But GLE Development Capital earlier this year raised Pounds 3.5m from the pension fund of the London Borough of Newham to bring funds under management to Pounds 13.5m. Mark Wignall, GLE Development Capital managing director, says the fund will invest as little as Pounds 100,000, although companies backed at this level will have to accept that up to a quarter of the money raised could be swallowed up in fees. The group remains one of the few sources of small amounts of equity for London-based companies, according to Wignall.</p>

			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Customs plans Euro blitz on VAT fraud CUSTOMS and Excise plans to station officers in other European Community countries as part of an EC-wide clamp down on value added tax fraud. The move follows the abolition of border controls at the beginning of this year. The 'attaches', based in British embassies, will carry out co-ordination and investigation work to prevent inter-EC VAT fraud. The plan is modelled on a successful customs network to uncover drug smuggling around the world. Customs is now seeking final approval to place attaches in Brussels, Paris and the Hague. If the initiative is successful, there may be postings in other member states. The plan has come to light at a time when the European Commission is working to strengthen co-ordination between national tax authorities in response to the changes caused by the single European market. The removal of border controls on January 1 means customs officers now depend on those who trade within the EC filing accurate monthly or quarterly VAT returns. They no longer collect documents on goods at EC borders. The EC recently introduced a system called the VAT Information Exchange System to trace trade across boundaries, and another called the Customs Intelligence System which relays anti-fraud messages between 170 computer terminals in the national customs services. It plans to introduce a further version by next summer. It also plans to launch its Matthaeus programme in 1995 to second about 100 EC tax investigators annually to other countries for two or three weeks each. Customs said it was too early to tell whether fraud had risen as a result of the single market. Attempts to gauge its impact have been complicated by companies' difficulties in complying with the new rules, some of which are yet to be finalised. But in the first three months of the new regime, Customs had brought its largest ever VAT fraud case to court. In March Operation Erie 2 had culminated in Customs charging 11 British nationals with a Pounds 10m VAT fraud on gold transported from Luxembourg to the UK. Mrs Christiane Scrivener, the commissioner responsible for EC tax policy, is expected to announce at the next Ecofin meeting for economic and finance ministers that there is little evidence so far of substantial fraud since the start of the single market. Her estimate is based on the fact that preliminary figures from member states show little difference between total VAT collection levels between this year and last.</p>

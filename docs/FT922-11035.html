			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Chernobyl reactors may berestarted warns Ukraine THE Ukrainian government is considering restarting undamaged nuclear reactors in the Chernobyl complex, site of the 1986 meltdown which is estimated to have led to between 6,000 and 8,000 deaths. The authorities say they may restart two reactors there unless international help is forthcoming to install a boiler independent of the plant to provide heating for the population still working in and around it. This was revealed yesterday by Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, the European Community's environment commissioner. He underlined the 'high and permanent risk' of Chernobyl-type disasters at other sites in the former Soviet Union. He was speaking at a news conference following his talks last week in Moscow and Kiev with senior scientists and government officials. Mr Ripa di Meana said they had provided information on 24 nuclear reactors which needed to be shut down, 'several dozen' obsolete nuclear-powered submarines which needed to be decommissioned, as well as unguarded nuclear waste sites. 'The staggering scale of this kind of endeavour will be a matter of survival both for them and for us,' Mr Ripa di Meana said. All four reactors at Chernobyl are shut down, after the meltdown in one reactor six years ago and a fire in a second reactor last year. Although the Ukrainian authorities intend to close the complex at the end of next year, Mr Ripa di Meana said they were examining whether to use for a year the two reactors that they 'consider in relatively good shape'. He said Ukrainian officials were due in Brussels soon to discuss alternatives. Mr Ripa di Meana said he had returned 'shocked' by the nuclear risk in the former Soviet republics: 'I think that every night without a problem is a good night. They are aware that at any moment there could be a new Chernobyl.' The priority was to deal with 11 Chernobyl-type reactors in Russia, three in the Ukraine and two in Lithuania, though he also drew attention to four later-generation reactors and four plutonium reactors in Russian military complexes. 'They are all using obsolete technology and being managed in a relatively unsafe and inefficient manner,' he said. Mr Yegor Gaidar, Russia's deputy prime minister, calculated the cost of decommissioning the reactors and replacing them with new ones at Dollars 1.2bn each, Mr Ripa di Meana said. An alternative was an energy-saving policy, costing about Dollars 15bn, that would reduce current energy use by about 25 per cent.</p>

			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Opposition member to quit party over scandal A SENIOR member of Japan's leading opposition party, the Social Democrats, has offered to leave the party after admitting he received funds from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, the transport company involved in a widening political scandal. Mr Ryoichi Yasutsune insisted, however, that he would stay in parliament as a pro-opposition independent, despite the pleas of his party leaders that he should also resign as a member of the upper house. The controversy over Mr Yasutsune's Sagawa Kyubin links has undermined the opposition's attempts to highlight government corruption as an issue in a forthcoming upper house election, and has eased pressure on Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, whose administration has also been shaken by scandal. Mr Yasutsune admitted that he received a Y5m (Pounds 22,000) loan from a Tokyo Sagawa affiliate in 1989, but claims to have since repaid the money and denies allegations that his often sharp questioning of the company's affairs was blunted after he received the funds. 'Although I am innocent, I will leave the party for causing trouble,' Mr Yasutsune said, after a meeting with party elders. He said that to leave parliament 'would mean that I admit that I had done something wrong'. Last week, a left-wing member of the Social Democratic Party resigned after admitting that he had received political donations from a golf course developer under investigation for alleged links to drug imports.</p>

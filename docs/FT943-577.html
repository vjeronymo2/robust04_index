			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Lack of Fed rates move boosts Dow Wall Street Blue chip stocks improved yesterday afternoon after the Federal Reserve decided to delay any move to tighter money, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 13.80 higher at 3,863.04, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 added 1.25 at 462.07. But the Nasdaq composite edged 0.26 lower to 755.37 and the American SE composite eased 0.36 to 453.42. Volume on the New York SE came to 290m shares. After weeks of anticipation by the markets, the big event proved to be somewhat anticlimactic. It was the day when the Fed's Open Market Committee met in Washington to decide whether to sanction a sixth increase in short-term interest rates this year. Most economists had expected the central bank to opt for delaying its move to more restrictive credit for a month or two. That position was vindicated when the meeting adjourned with no announcement of a policy change. Beforehand, the stock market was handed some evidence that the economy was cooling. The Conference Board said its September index of consumer confidence had fallen from its August level. It was a hopeful sign for investors, some of whom were concerned that the prospect of an accelerating economy would prompt the Fed to lift rates immediately. Still, the Dow industrials were able to make some progress in the morning. Later, when it became evident a rate increase was not forthcoming, bond traders began to push the price of the inflation-sensitive 30-year issue down. The Dow quickly retreated in sympathy. But when the damage to bonds was contained at moderate levels, the blue chips climbed back. The individual gains were fractional, with a few exceptions. Alcoa's stock climbed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 87 1/8 , lifted in part by a 'buy' recommendation from PaineWebber. International Paper moved ahead Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 79 3/8 , while Goodyear Tire advanced Dollars 1 to Dollars 33 1/8 with the help of favourable comments by Mr David Garrity, an analyst at Smith Barney. Merck appreciated Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 36. Elsewhere, share prices were mixed. Declines on the Big Board held a slight edge over advances. In telecommunications, Nynex strengthened Dollars 2 to Dollars 38 after submitting a seven-year framework plan for regulating phone services in New York state, its primary market. A coalition of telecom providers, including MCI and AT&amp;T, is offering active opposition to the proposal. Micron Technology, the semiconductor supplier, shed Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 35 1/8. Trading in the shares was brisk following a CS First Boston downgrade on Monday. Texas Instruments firmed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 68 5/8 as Morgan Stanley placed it on its 'buy' list. Insurance group 20th Century Industries, hard hit by the Californian earthquake last winter, jumped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 11 1/8 on news that American International Group had agreed to help shore up its financial position as part of a broad strategic alliance. AIG lost Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 89 7/8. On the Nasdaq, the technology sector rode out the session with little movement in either direction. But Lotus Development was set back Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 35 1/8. Canada Toronto gained ground in moderate trading as US central bankers took no action on interest rates. After a day of mixed trading the TSE 300 index staged a rally late in the session, sparked by the Fed news. The index closed 19.36 ahead at 4,360.78. However, declines led rises by 392 to 349 after volume of 57.8m shares. The consensus among analysts is that the Fed has decided to wait a while longer before making a move on interest rates, especially in the face of ongoing trade talks with Japan and heavy economic data coming down the pipe in the coming weeks.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Friday prayers second sermon delivered by Ayatollah </F> Mohammad Yazdi, head of the judiciary, in Tehran on 28 January  -- recorded]    [Excerpts] In the name of God, the merciful, the  compassionate. [passage omitted: prayers, inviting worshippers  to observe piety and importance of the revolution anniversary  celebrations]    Another issue, to which I will briefly refer, is the issue  of  cooperation between the esteemed government and the Majlis. It  is a pleasure to see those two big powers have full cooperation  and understanding, particularly in important issues such as the  1373 [year starting 21 March 1994] budget and the Second  Five-Year Development Plan. They will solve the problems through  close consultation and understanding. God willing, both powers  will perform their duties.    I ask the esteemed deputies to be coherent, as much as  possible, and consider the future. Do not look at issues on an  individual basis and through the sole consideration of your own  constituency. Look at them according to the constitution, state  laws, and in relation with the world. In fact, look at the  current and future effects of those issues. You yourselves are,  more than anyone else, aware of the important role of this kind  of outlook. I ask the esteemed government, and particularly the  esteemed ministers who have a role in the budget issues and the  plan -- on which all cabinet ministers play a role -- to make  the most use of experts and other consultants who may even not  be so famous. The more a decision is based on expert and  scientific opinion, the better its effects. [passage omitted]    The first duty of judicial power is to monitor the best  implementation of the laws and confront the violators at  different levels. I apologize that I cannot mention the  violators' names, whether government affiliated or not, who may  exist in various offices, ministries, and organizations. They  have been confronted and they will be confronted. We have had  some cases, which I do not want to mention here. It is not good  to go on a platform and talk about shortcomings.    I would like to say here that your country's judicial  apparatus is using all its power and all the supervisory devices  at its disposal to supervise the rule of law in the country and  confront the offenders. There are other organs that help the  judiciary perform its duties properly, such as intelligence  bodies, and law enforcement and popular forces. Now there might  be an individual case who may come to me or to you, and faced  with this situation I should not interpret this in a special way  and raise the question: What is the government up to? This is  why I stress the importance of a holistic and generalistic  outlook and far-sightedess.    Now to the issue of Afghanistan. I would like to call on my  Muslims brothers and tell them: O brothers! Enough is enough.  Do not destroy your country any more. Do not fight against one  another any more. Why do you not put your weapons away and sit  together and talk to resolve your issues and reform your  country? Do not constantly associate yourselves with certain  bodies and create this ugly situation that might prompt someone  to question Islam's ability to manage and rule, God forbid. It  was under the banner of Islam that you succeeded in deposing the  previous regime and then set out to establish an Islamic  government. Can you not see our country, where in a very short  period of time all the internal squabbles came to an end and the  late Imam [Khomeyni], may he be admitted to God's paradise, put  a stop to all the arguments? Of course we had different  opinions here, and we still do, and we always will. Such  differences are only natural. However, how long do you intend  to inflict so much destruction on a poor country? Enough is  enough; stop the civil war!    Now to Bosnia-Herzegovina. Given what you all know, one is  really ashamed of all the international organizations, which  according to what has recently been announced, have issued  nearly 30 resolutions, only one of which has been implemented.  This is the one preventing Bosnia-Herzegovina from defend  itself. They have implemented this resolution pretty well, while  nothing has been done about the rest; nothing of course but idle  words. They are all after the partition of that Islamic land  and the suppression of the Muslims. However, we are confident  that the Muslims, under any condition, will not be prepared to  suffer shame, and they will not concede to the partition of  their country, no matter what hardship they have to endure.  [crowd chants]    As the compromise agreement progresses both sides realize  what the situation is. The fact that Rabin said we would not  even retreat from the Golan Heights and the occupied lands shows  how things are. Optimists should realize what the final outcome  will be. We are certain that the home of Palestinians belongs  to the Palestinians and that they should return to their home.    My time is up. There are two or three more issues that I  will not talk about, but simply refer to. The approval of the  Dutch Senate in connection with a legal and judicial matter --  with a majority of three -- that prescribes mercy killing, as  they put it, is definitely rejected and condemned in our view,  as the judicial and legal system of the Islamic Republic of  Iran. It is not correct to kill a patient even in the last  moments of his life, out of mercy and for a quicker release.    The remarks made by the head of the Turkish Constituent  Court  [as heard] are totally rejected by us. Fortunately, some  Muslims in Turkey--and another fortunate thing was that the  prime minister himself was involved in the matter--have rejected  his remarks. That gentleman thinks--I am speaking for the  judicial sector--that he can say anything he wants when he is in  court. He says Islam cannot be considered as a system of  government. What he has said is pointless. That judge should  be told: You might be of high rank, but your legal knowledge is  very poor, let alone your Islamic knowledge. You should  reconsider.

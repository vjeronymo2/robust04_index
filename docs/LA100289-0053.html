			<p><P> October 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIKE DOWNEY: THEY ARE 4-0 AND READY TO GO . . .  </P> <P> All right, you lovers of men in horned helmets, and we don't mean the Vikings,  now you can go ahead and say those two crazy little words that you have been  dying to say.  </P> <P> "Super Bowl."  </P> <P> It's OK now to dream big. The Rams have demonstrated that they can beat  anybody, anyplace -- even the 49ers at San Francisco. They didn't get snuffed  out at Candlestick. They came, they played, they conquered Sunday, 13-12,  showing they can overcome any odds but the over-under.  </P> <P> Goodness gracious, great balls of fire, what has gotten into these Rams? Little  by little, these young goats have turned into one really tough professional  football organization, one that trades away Eric Dickerson and gets better.  </P> <P> (For those of us who approved of that deal, excuse us while we gloat.)  </P> <P> These people are primed to win their first Super Bowl, believe me. No, don't  believe me -- believe them.  </P> <P> The Rams believe in themselves. They believe that they are going to win even  when they are losing in the final minute and they are playing on their  opponents' field and their opponents happen to be the 1989 Super Bowl supermen,  the 49ers.  </P> <P> The thought of going belly-up never seemed to enter the Rams' minds. Jim  Everett just popped a couple of passes to Pete Holohan, then stood back and let  Holohan hold the ball in the middle of Candlestick Park's baseball diamond for  Mike (I Hit Better Than Carney) Lansford, who kicked it through the uprights to  win the game, which is a neat little habit of his.  </P> <P> These guys have become a tough, tough bunch, these Los Angeles Rambos. They  looked Joe Montana in the eye Sunday and refused him passage into their end  zone. Not one touchdown did the Rambos yield. They knocked Montana on his  Butte.  </P> <P> Beating Kansas City, Indianapolis and Green Bay, that was one thing, but  beating Montana, Jerry Rice, Roger Craig and that crowd without giving up a  touchdown, man, that takes some doing. Kevin Greene and the rest of the Rambo  defense never gave an inch.  </P> <P> Nothing delays the Rams these days -- not even the airlines. When their flight  to San Francisco got stuck on the ground Saturday, the Rams simply got off,  lined up on the Tarmac and ran plays right there in the airport.  </P> <P> Everett took a rubber ball he usually uses for strengthening his grip and made  believe it was a football as the guys scrimmaged on the runway.  </P> <P>  "OK, Henry, you go down by the United 747, then cut left behind that baggage  cart. Willie, zigzag past the Delta DC-10 and circle around behind the  stewardess. On two!"  </P> <P> Preseason speculation led us to believe the Rams would be serious Super Bowl  contenders this season, but you never know about that stuff. With the Rams in  particular, you never know if a running back is going to be a holdout or if  some other important player is going to be wasting away in Cocaineville.  </P> <P> Besides, everybody in the National Football Conference believed this was going  to be their year.  </P> <P> San Francisco had Montana back. Philadelphia had the new, improved Montana,  Randall Cunningham. Chicago was its usual tough self and Minnesota thought  itself tougher than Chicago. Washington and New York demanded their customary  respect, Dallas, Green Bay and Atlanta had good rookies, Phoenix felt frisky  and New Orleans knew this was finally the year that the Superdome on Super Bowl  Sunday would not be a neutral field.  </P> <P> The Rams, well, they were better, sure. But this was still the team San  Francisco had beaten as recently as 1987 by the gruesome little score of 48-0.  Could the Rams have improved that much in two seasons?  </P> <P> Sure looks that way.  </P> <P> The Rambos have never been bad under John Robinson. They ordinarily have been  winners and almost always competitive. Yet, come playoff time, nobody ever  really believed, except Georgia Frontiere and those employed by her, that they  could go the distance.  </P> <P> Today, Georgia's bulldogs look lean and hungry.  </P> <P> Things are definitely on the upswing in Anaheim. The offense has the E Ride of  Everett to Ellard. Greg Bell is more dependable than that guy with the tinted  goggles in Indianapolis. The offensive line for the Rams, well, these goats can  butt. This Tom Newberry, for example, has become a pro's pro. He clears holes  sportswriters could run through.  </P> <P> There was a time, not so very long ago, when the Ram offense amounted to three  clouds of dust and Dale Hatcher. Well, the Rams don't have to get 150 yards  rushing out of their running back to win anymore. Thanks for the memories,  Dickerson and Charlie White, but now we've got a guy who can pass.  </P> <P> On the outskirts of Disneyland, the Super Bowl no longer feels like  Fantasyland. It's more like Tomorrowland.  </P></p>

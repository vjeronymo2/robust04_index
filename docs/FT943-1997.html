			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries retreat amid concern over dollar US Treasury bonds retreated yesterday on news of a widening US trade deficit and an uncertain outlook on monetary policy. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  3/16 lower at 96 13/16 , with the yield rising to 7.769 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was down  1/32 at 99, to yield 6.404 per cent. A combination of subtle factors served to push the market lower during the session. It suffered heavy losses during the morning, but gradually improved as the day progressed. At the opening, traders reported a heavy wave of selling by foreign investors concerned by the increasing likelihood that the Federal Reserve would lift short-term interest rates before November. Many investors were expecting an early move by the Fed in the light of Friday's strong industrial production and capacity utilisation figures. The risk of tighter credit conditions appeared to be persuading many of them to shift their investments overseas. Yesterday's trade data reinforced the thinking behind such a strategy. The Commerce Department reported that the deficit in goods and services had widened to Dollars 11bn in July, against expectations of Dollars 9.5bn. The trend raised fresh concern over the value of the dollar, especially in advance of an upcoming round of US-Japanese trade talks. Although the dollar showed only limited weakness yesterday, a sustained sell-off in the coming weeks would make US-denominated government securities less attractive to foreign investors. Many of them were taking no chances yesterday. Traders took advantage of the relatively steady conditions prevailing since the week began to reduce their holdings. European government bonds had another volatile day, weakening in the morning and recouping some of their losses in the afternoon. Rumours that German August M3 money supply data, due today, would be worse than expected pressured prices across Europe. Weak US Treasuries and Far-Eastern selling ahead of the fiscal half-year-end were a further dampener. Market sentiment remains gloomy, with dealers continuing to worry about rising European interest rates, while most end-investors remain sidelined, running defensive positions. Bond chart technicals also are negative, pointing to continued bearish sentiment. The German bund market responded with cautious optimism to the Bundesbank's announcement that it would auction a 10-year floating-rate government bond next week. The final terms of the issue, whose coupon will be linked to the three-month Frankfurt Interbank Rate (Fibor), will be set by the German bond consortium on Tuesday, when the first portion of bonds will be placed. A second tranche will be auctioned the next day. Some observers argued that the move reflected a desperate scramble for funding alternatives by a central bank faced with a huge borrowing requirement in the final quarter. 'When governments start issuing floating-rate bonds, it looks like an act of desperation,' said Mr Nigel Richardson of Yamaichi International. 'If you want to be charitable, you can call it a flexible approach to debt management, but I feel it reflects the acceptance of a very weak market,' said Mr George Magnus of S. G. Warburg Securities. However, others welcomed the move, which they said would take some of the funding burden off the long end of the yield curve. 'They may not want to add to the backlog of 10-year supply, which is positive for the market and could help the (yield) curve to flatten,' said one dealer. Many dealers were confident the paper would meet strong demand from German money market funds, which became legal on August 1. UK gilts had another volatile day, falling sharply in the morning but recovering in the afternoon to close only slightly weaker. The Bank of England announced it would auction Pounds 2bn of gilts due 2005 with a coupon of 8.5 per cent next Wednesday. The stock is the first offering of next year's 10-year benchmark. The Dollars 2bn size was smaller than some expected, lending some support to the 10-year sector in the afternoon. Much of the early pressure on gilts came from the short end of the yield curve, amid fears of further monetary tightening after last week's base rate increase. The September three-month sterling futures contract on Liffe fell 0.11 to 94.04.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Richard Ovinnikov, ambassador extraordinary and </F> plenipotentiary, doctor of historical sciences: "We Should Be  Proud of Our Mission"]    [Text] The Russian Federation, which is currently  overloaded to breaking point, will, of course, ultimately  determine its fate itself, within its own walls. But the  question also of the international climate in this difficult  period is far from secondary.    The dramatic content of the external problems which Russia  is  encountering is obvious. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union,  it has for the first time in several centuries been deprived  both of the western and Central Asia-Transcaucasus cordon.  Beyond its new borders is an encircling focal point of  conflicts, and 25 million of its colinguals today rank as  foreigners.    To avoid being caught unawares by the further development of  events, a sober, impartial analysis of trends in the surrounding  world is required. It is time that Russians tired of the  incantations about the fact that to each proclaimed course there  is no alternative recalled the truth that the way to the future  is always variant. As far as the possible forecasts for the  future are concerned, four scenarios of the impact of the  surrounding world on the national interests of the Russian  Federation may be imagined.    First scenario (optimistic or positive). The  reintegration of the economies of a sizable number of countries  of the CIS and their political and military interface occur.  Conflicts on Russia's borders subside. Relations with countries  of East Europe improve. The West, primarily in the shape of the  Seven, renders the restoration and modernization of our industry  appreciable assistance by way of large investments and the  lifting of trade restrictions.    Second scenario (pessimistic or negative).  Economic and political disintegration of the space around Russia  occurs. It suffocates without friends or markets. Problems of  its security as a consequence of the proliferation of nuclear  weapons close by and/or the growth of conflicts along the  perimeter intensify sharply. The West, denying Russia  stabilization on its borders, engages in a tug-of-war in respect  to the former allies and republics of the USSR, and its economic  interaction with us amounts to shoring up Russia's raw material  sectors.    Third scenario (interim or stagnant). The  formation of a common market of the CIS comes to a standstill.  With the East European countries--cool relations. Conflicts  along Russia's perimeter smolder, although they do not develop  into a conflagration. The danger of the proliferation of nuclear  weapons nearby hangs in the air. The West dribbles out economic  assistance and politically and strategically contemplates the  development of events.    Fourth scenario (sudden or spontaneous). An abrupt  deterioration in Russian-Ukrainian relations arises. In the wake  of the Transcaucasus, borders are revised in Central Asia  between former Union republics. Tension is created throughout  the system of relations with an increasingly assertive West. The  distant surroundings could bring rolling to Russia seismic waves  of their own tectonic shifts--the bankruptcies of a number of  important developing countries, trade wars, and the unleashing  of "hot wars" in the Third World or against it.    It is not known which of these scenarios is possible today.  There are even more uncertainties with regard to their probable  combinations. The sole solution for Russia in this situation is  to be ready to defend its national interests all along the line  and to assert its statehood. Precise reference points are  required for this first and foremost.    It would seem that the cornerstone of the policy course of  the Russian Federation should, as in critical times in the past  also, be its clear understanding of its own significance in  world geopolitics. A big ship has no need to be constantly  flashing its lights. It cannot be forgotten that we are a major  global factor, and in emergency situations, an irreplaceable  factor.    The truth is that the entire history of mankind in the  second  millennium would have developed tragically had there not been at  the intersection of Europe and Asia the Russian state. Three  times it has saved the European continent, and on the last  occasion, the world also, from unprecedented aggression. The  first time, when, in the 13th-15th centuries, Russians shielded  Europe from the invasion of the hordes of the descendants of  Genghis Khan. The second, at the start of the 19th century, when  Russia crushed the armies of Napoleon, invincible to subjugated  Europe. The third time, in the 1940's, when two-thirds of the  might of Hitler's fascism was pulverized and its backbone broken  on the Soviet-German front. Who else could have done all this?    Russia has thus traditionally, throughout the millennium,  acted the part of proven stabilizer of European civilization,  guarantor of its peace, and dependable shield against history's  biggest acts of aggression. To maintain anything different is to  falsify.    It is odd under these conditions, if not insulting to  Russians' national pride, to hear today talk to the effect that,  for example, Russia generally (both tsarist and Soviet) has  always been a "constant threat" to Europe. But this imaginary  threat has simply never materialized. Or that Russia, the times  of the USSR included, has been an invariable "potential  aggressor." Finally, that Russia, ideology notwithstanding, is  organically typified by sinister "imperial ambitions." And once  again this is merely something ascribed to us, but unconfirmed.    Well, lack of scruples, let it pass. Gratitude is a stranger  to politics. But today's rehashes of unfriendly tunes must not,  in any event, provoke us into needless and humiliating excuses  or evoke an inferiority complex. Russians have nothing to make  excuses for. We should be proud of our noble historical mission  and continue it. Russia was, is now, and will remain a great  power vitally necessary to the world. Only such a confident,  majestic position is the way to its revival.    A most important specific task of the Russian Federation, as  of any other state also, is the assurance of tranquillity for  internal transformations, primarily by way of the formation of  friendly surroundings. Today these are primarily the CIS  countries. Agreeing to their unnatural alienation would mean  tearing up our own age-old roots, the earth for which cannot be  imported from overseas. Russians do not, understandably, want  such a development. At the recent elections, relations within  the CIS figured as a priority in the programs of the majority of  election associations. Of course, it can only be a question of a  process of voluntary unity by political methods.    Another large-scale practical goal of the Russian Federation  on the outside is assurance of a general healthy international  climate. This signifies a renunciation in principle of  confrontation with the West and a readiness for mutually  profitable and long-term cooperation. But this presupposes also  Russia's firm defense of its inalienable national interests and  legitimate and equal rights in world politics and economics. In  any event, attempts to erect either a cordon sanitaire or a wire  mesh very close to Russia's borders are unnatural,  discriminatory, and unacceptable.    Are any of these reference points a threat to anyone's  interests? Great, sovereign Russia, with its "exceptional mien,"  is approaching the world of the future in the best possible way.</p>

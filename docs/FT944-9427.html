			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Irish coalition teeters on the brink: How a political marriage turned sour Ireland woke up wearily yesterday to the realisation that yet another government had been dragged close to the brink of collapse. The political showdown, which could yet be resolved in parliament today, has nonetheless soured relations between Fianna Fail and its Labour partner. On this occasion it was triggered by Labour party criticism of the attorney general's mishandling of a child abuse case. The Fianna Fail prime minister, Mr Albert Reynolds, almost certainly misjudged the reaction of his junior coalition partner to his appointment of the attorney general, Mr Harry Whelehan, as president of the High Court. However, the roots of this particular breakdown go deeper and lie in the unhappy marriage between Fianna Fail, the dominant force in Irish politics since the foundation of the state in the 1920s, and Labour, the small left-of-centre party. From the beef tribunal scandal to the famous X-case involving the attorney general's injunction preventing a 14-year-old rape victim from seeking an abortion in the UK, Labour has looked increasingly uncomfortable. Even on the key foreign policy issue of Northern Ireland, there were suggestions that Labour was unhappy with Mr Reynolds's insistence on forcing the pace on the peace process. The government was formed in January 1993, after the 1992 general election prompted by Fianna Fail's falling out with its former partners, the Progressive Democrats. There have been natural policy differences. On social issues, Labour has had to swallow hard. Despite six cabinet posts against Fianna Fail's nine, it has appeared isolated from the key economic decision-making. A tax amnesty aimed at enticing black earnings into the exchequer, passed last year, was unsuccessfully resisted by Labour. There have been squabbles about how to spend the Pounds 7bn Ireland receives from the European Union in farm support and structural and other funds. But in many dispassionate Irish eyes, the coalition, the first between these two parties, has made considerable legislative progress, passing some 40 bills. At one level, the Reynolds-Spring team seemed an awkward combination. It was partly a question of generation - Mr Reynolds at 59, is 15 years older than the Labour leader, Mr Dick Spring. Mr Reynolds, despite heading what is in Ireland the establishment party, is unusual in being a self-made man, having amassed a fortune in the pet food business and before that as a showband impresario. Mr Spring, by contrast, entered politics in 1981, taking over the North Kerry seat on the death of his father, a dynastic practice common in the Irish parliament. But, at a deeper level, there is a fundamental personality difference. Mr Reynolds's can-do approach to policy has often seemed high-handed, and has irritated the prickly and rather solemn Labour leader. In the current row, for all the high moral talk of 'public accountability', there were few illusions in Dublin that the real scalp Mr Spring is seeking is that of Mr Reynolds himself. They have clashed before; on both occasions Mr Spring gave ground. First, there was the case of the two foreigners who had invested in Mr Reynolds's petfood business who were given citizenship: the so-called 'passports for sale' scandal. The final straw was the Beef Tribunal, an investigation into the misuse of official export credits, where Mr Spring again found himself questioning the prime minister's role. With convenient timing, when the Dail (parliament) came to debate the issue, the controversy was overshadowed by the IRA's ceasefire. In forcing the issue to a head, Mr Spring has clearly calculated that this crisis is sufficient to take to the country, a measure of how the moral climate has changed in Ireland in the past two decades. The emotive issue of child abuse by a Catholic priest, is seen by the Labour strategists as a natural winner, pitting 'secular' Labour against Fianna Fail, traditionally the church's political ally. Fianna Fail may still command the loyalty of its largely rural-based support; an opinion poll only 10 days put the party streets ahead, with 50 per cent. However, with one of the youngest populations in Europe, and the fastest rates of rural depopulation, this latest crisis could well signal a significant shift in the centre of political gravity in Irish politics. Like British attitudes to royalty, the Irish have a fascination with the moral mishaps of their priests. As Fianna Fail's popularity at the polls fades, so the church's hold over society has weakened, and the old irredentist myths of a united Ireland have faded. In a society which holds its rock stars up as examples of excellence, Fianna Fail no longer looks to many younger people like the natural party of government. It would doubly ironic if, as seemed possible yesterday, President Mary Robinson were now to play a key role in this crisis. It was her election, more than any other recent event which underlined these changes. Her victory as Ireland's first woman president marked Fianna Fail's first ever defeat for its presidential candidate.</p>

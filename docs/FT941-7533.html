			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Trans-Alpine road traffic One cannot help feeling sympathy with the Swiss and the Austrians. Nationals of both countries are horrified at the prospect of yet more lorries thundering through the Alps, spewing out pollution and destroying the natural beauty. Such emotions are behind last weekend's Swiss referendum, in which a majority voted to ban all transit lorry traffic through the Alps over 10 years. They also explain the tough stance currently being taken by Austria in its negotiations to join the European Union. It wants to maintain, for another 10 years, restrictions on the number of EU lorries allowed to cross Austria. The Austrians and Swiss have their hearts in the right place. The environmental damage caused by trans-Alpine road traffic must be curtailed. But the means both countries are employing to achieve this goal leave much to be desired and threaten to disrupt relations between them and other European countries. The main problem is the discriminatory nature of the policies. In Switzerland's case, only transit traffic is to be banned. Lorries travelling within the country or between Switzerland and other countries will not be affected. The main loser will be traffic between the north and south of Europe, particularly between Germany and Italy. Similarly, Austria wishes to keep its 'eco-points' system, which limits the number of lorries allowed to cross the country. This is an environmentally adjusted quota system: transit quotas are given to each Union country and then adjusted according to how dirty the lorries are. Again, only transit traffic is affected. In this case, a big loser is Greece. Sticking point Both the Swiss and Austrian approaches are causing friction with the European Union. In the Swiss case, discrimination is not the only issue. The referendum, which is binding unless repealed by another referendum, means the government will not be able to abide by the terms of an accord with the EU on lorry traffic. The EU will rightly worry whether future agreements with the Swiss government are worth the paper on which they are written. But the Austrian dimension is more pressing because Alpine traffic has become a sticking point in the enlargement negotiations which are near their deadline. The talks were always going to be difficult. But the knock-on effects of the Swiss referendum have made things worse. Austrians are afraid that traffic banned from crossing Switzerland will be diverted through their Alps instead. A way must be found of reconciling the environmental concerns of the Alpine nations with the need to move goods between different parts of Europe. The obvious solution is to place a greater emphasis on rail transport. This, in turn, requires more investment in rail infrastructure and a tilting of the economic incentives so that haulage companies find it attractive to switch their goods from road to rail. Little progress Switzerland has made much progress in switching traffic from road to rail. Nearly 80 per cent of transit traffic already goes this way. Matters will be improved when the new SFr20bn Gotthard rail tunnel is complete. The country also plans to link lorry road taxes to the distance they travel. Austria, by contrast, has made little progress in improving its trans-Alpine rail infrastructure. Feasibility studies for a new Ecu10bn rail link through the Brenner pass are not yet finished, meaning completion is at least 10, and perhaps 20, years away. It is possible, though, that the Brenner link will receive a fillip as part of the European Union's trans-European networks initiative which is now gaining momentum. The European Commission is holding a meeting of Alpine states to discuss trans-Alpine infrastructure next month. Austria's concerns, of course, cannot wait until this process is concluded. The deadline for the enlargement talks is too pressing. The Union must therefore publicly and swiftly reassure Austria that it fully sympathises with its desire to protect the Alps. But it must continue to stress that such protection must be applied on a non-discriminatory basis. Evenhandedness would not only be fairer to EU countries. It would also offer greater protection for the environment.</p>

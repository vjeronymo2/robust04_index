			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Cut-price Midas who lost his touch - How his price-over-quality ethos eventually backfired on Gerald Ratner THE MAN with the Midas touch, they called him. But that was in the 1980s, when every retailer on the high street appeared capable of turning whatever they touched into gold. In Mr Gerald Ratner's case it was nine-carat gold. But as the colder winds of the late 1980s blew down Britain's high streets, the decade's retail stars began to fall one by one from the firmament. For some time Mr Ratner, 43, stood alone as a 1980s retailer still in charge of his company. Some thought he could survive while the others failed. But yesterday he resigned from the group which his father founded, where he spent his entire 26-year working life, and which he has run since 1984. Mr Ratner, a man of slight build and medium height, an engaging charm and a wicked wit, a tasteful dresser who confines his visible trinkets to an expensive watch, was an unlikely character to be the man who transformed jewellery retailing in the UK. When he took control of the family business in 1984, it was making a Pounds 1m profit. In those days jewellery shops were intimidating places, visited only for those occasional purchases, an engagement or wedding ring, a gold watch. The sales assistants were to be approached with hushed voices, and there was a belief that the goods were not only for adornment but an investment. Mr Ratner turned that upside-down. Within months of taking charge, the Financial Times was quoting the new managing director saying: 'The new merchanting and marketing strategies introduced in the second half of last year have benefited the trading performance significantly in the current year.' Sales were up by a quarter. That was only the start. His aim was to sell people the jewellery they could afford rather than the quality they could not. The price of a pair of ear-rings came down from several pounds to a couple of pounds until they reached 99p - the price, Mr Ratner once quipped, of a Marks and Spencer prawn sandwich. Plastering the shops with stickers proclaiming price cuts, cutting the volume of gold in the jewellery, tightening up the supply chain and stock control, and increasing the fashion element of the merchandise began to attract more customers. But at the same time it was permanently devaluing the company's products. His now famous 'crap' remark was not new when he made it in April 1991. It was first said in 1987, in reference to a sherry decanter and glasses set, then retailing for Pounds 14.95. 'How can you sell it so cheaply?' he was asked. 'Because it's crap.' His dismay when the remark appeared in the Financial Times turned to delight when he discovered that people liked the joke. His nervousness in making public speeches meant he liked to work up a reliable act. The crap joke became one of the highlights. Mr Ratners' behaviour was angering others in the jewellery trade. As his market share grew other retailers suffered. His suppliers were angry too. Ratners would buy on a sale or return basis, so unsold stock would be dumped back on them. Mr Ratner, and his cousin Mr Victor Ratner who was in charge of buying, once explained: 'We persuaded suppliers it was better for them as well as us to have their faster selling lines in our windows'. Profits flourished, reaching a peak of Pounds 130m in 1990. And Mr Ratner could not resist talking about his success. Anyone who rang him to ask how trading was going would receive an earful of numbers - sales in like-for-like H Samuel stores were up 20 per cent last week, and Ratners up 26 per cent, he might say. There was always a niggling thought that these figures were being plucked from mid-air. But who cared - people wanted to believe him. And he always came up with the goods in the form of rising profits. Mr Ratner's other weakness was doing deals. He simply could not pass up a bargain in the jewellery trade. He once achieved a notable double, launching a rights issue to acquire a US chain before a previous equity issue to finance a UK purchase had been completed. Every deal was to be the last, but they kept coming. H Samuel, Ernest Jones, Zales and Salisbury's in the UK, and Sterling and Kay in the US, plus many more smaller ones. At first there was a huge appetite from shareholders for more paper, and the deals were financed through equity issues. But eventually that appetite was sated. Ratners turned to borrowing. All these things came together in 1990 and 1991. The Kay acquisition in 1990 was hard fought, and Ratner was persuaded to pay more than he should have - he could not walk away from the deal. As the high street recession deepened in 1990, his suppliers were to find a large part of the Christmas stock returned to them - they would not be prepared to suffer that again in the 1991 season. And finally his comic turn, performed to the Institute of Directors at what he thought was a private meeting in April 1991, led to headlines including the words 'Ratners' and 'crap' in the tabloid press, the papers his customers read. The 99p ear-ring buyers were not amused. They felt deceived. A formal apology from Mr Ratner did little to stop the downturn in sales. By Christmas 1991 sales were falling badly. Yet more price cuts failed to enliven them and in January this year - with the group's net debt at Pounds 223m and shareholders' funds of Pounds 303m - the talks with the bankers began. A new executive chairman was brought in over his head, his cousin resigned and one of his longest serving directors retired. Mr Ratner, a much subdued man, clung on. He saw through the publication of a Pounds 122.3m pre-tax loss in August. He announced a change in strategy - 'we cannot carry on being a sales-led organisation.' He survived an angry annual meeting in September. But with the Christmas season approaching, with Ratners' very future at stake, he could stay no longer.</p>

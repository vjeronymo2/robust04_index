			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Celsis deeper in red after heavy research spending Celsis International, the biotechnology company which raised Pounds 12.4m from its flotation last year, reported sharply increased first half losses following a threefold rise in research spending. The specialist manufacturer of contamination detection equipment endured pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.23m (Pounds 561,000), as research and development costs rose from Pounds 307,000 to Pounds 963,000 in the six months to September 30. Heavy spending on new products - used mainly for testing food, cosmetics and drugs - helped drain the group's cash balances, which fell from Pounds 12.3m to Pounds 8.63m. While reluctant to give an annualised figure for rate at which it uses reserves, Mr Mark Clement, finance director, said the group used up Pounds 650,000 last month. Mr Clement however, sought to distance itself from other biotechnology companies faced with the challenge of clinical trials by pointing out that its products were either already available or close to launch. Sales of existing products helped lift turnover from Pounds 79,000 to Pounds 302,000 while gross profits reached Pounds 183,000 (Pounds 63,000). Although losses per share rose from 1.05p to 3.7p, the company is expected to move into profit by 1997. Predicting a sharp growth in demand for the group's products, Mr Arthur Holden, chief executive, said it could capture a sizeable slice of a market likely to be worth Dollars 7.99bn (Pounds 5.05bn) by the end of the decade. 'Most of our competitors are small, under-capitalised, one-technology companies. We can exploit an under-developed market.' It has signed collaborative deals with companies such as Wellcome, Merck and Colgate Palmolive for equipment designed to reduce manufacturing costs by speeding up the testing process.</p>

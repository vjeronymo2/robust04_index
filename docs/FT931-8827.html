			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: London stocks react to US setback SHARP reaction from both the US currency and Wall Street share prices to President Bill Clinton's warning of higher taxes ahead pulled the rug from under the London stock market yesterday. A recovery from early falls, prompted by favourable views of the latest UK Public Sector Borrowing statistics, was abruptly reversed and London fell nearly 38 points on the FT-SE 100 scale as the Dow dropped 78 points in early trading. London's setback, driven by a plunge in stock index futures where the March contract fell to a discount, came almost too quickly for the bears to get out of the market. But there was a good deal of attempted selling of the blue chips as the pound climbed against the US dollar in late dealings. The final minutes of the London session saw the Footsie rallying with the Dow Average after regulatory suspension of dealing in stock index futures on the New York market. The final reading left the FT-SE 100 down 33.7 points at 2,812.2, after dipping to 2,808 earlier. At 3009.5, the FT-SE Mid 250 lost 13 points. Trading volume increased as the market fell away and traders feared that the Footsie 2,800 mark could be tested today. Domestic considerations were entirely blotted out by the setback in New York. Equities had opened firmly as the January distributive trades survey by the Confederation of British Industry appeared to indicate a modest revival in the UK economy. But the 6-point gain on the FT-SE 100 was replaced by a 17-point drop as traders took on board a heavy profits fall at British Airways, a Pounds 295m rights call from Bowater and a weak opening by stock index futures. Selling was modest and Seaq volume was slow to climb to 400m shares. The mood brightened quickly when news of a repayment of Pounds 3.83bn on public sector debt in January cheered the government bond market and prompted some economists to revise downwards their UK budget deficit forecasts. In spite of nervousness ahead of Wall Street's reaction to President Clinton's taxation warning, the UK market was only a few points off as opening time for the New York market drew nigh. But all this optimism was swept aside by the Dow's plunge and UK traders sounded unhappy as the Dow continued its fall after the London market closed. Today and tomorrow could prove significant tests for the UK stock market. At home, investors are braced for the release this morning of the January retail sales figures and, perhaps more keenly, for disclosure tomorrow of the unemployment data for the month. Analysts fear that UK unemployment could breach the 3m total, perhaps even prompting another reduction in base rates 'from weakness rather than strength', as one senior trader suggested yesterday. Today also brings President Clinton's State of the Union Address to Congress and important auctions in the New York bond market, as well as the outcome of the latest repo arrangements by the Bundesbank. After a slow start yesterday, Seaq volume finally advanced to 634.3m shares, of which around 62 per cent was in non-Footsie stocks. On Monday, equity retail business worth fell to only Pounds 864.9m, the first daily total below Pounds 1bn since the Christmas period.</p>

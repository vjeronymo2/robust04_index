			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] Alija Izetbegovic, the president of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, held talks on two occasions today  with the special envoy of the UN secretary general, Yasushi  Akashi. Let us now hear what President Alija Izetbegovic and  Yasushi Akashi had to say following their second meeting this  evening.    [Begin Izetbegovic recording] We have just completed the  second round of talks with Mr. Akashi and his aides, including  General Rose and General Cot, and a number of other aides, seven  or eight of them. The gist is that we will agree to a  cease-fire in the Sarajevo region under the irrevocable  condition that the Serb side withdraws its heavy artillery from  around the city that they use to kill the population. As far as  I was told, and it is my understanding, the Serb side refuses to  accept this, but wants some kind of soft monitoring or something  of that kind, which will not stop them from pounding the town  again. We will not accept this.    I asked Akashi to explain how else can they [the Serbs]  explain their insistence on keeping the artillery on the hills  around the city but for a desire to kill the people whenever  they wish. For, it is obvious that such actions have no  military importance and serve to threaten the civilian  population of the city. I am convinced that out of the people  killed so far, 99 percent were civilians, the civilian  population of the city which, as you know, includes 1,300  children and a very small number of soldiers. In other words,  they have no military reason to keep their artillery there.    The talks will resume tomorrow. We will insist on the  withdrawal of their artillery and on placing it under effective  supervision. Whether the other side will accept this I do not  know, but we will tell the world about it. The world must learn  what the artillery means, what its task is. I repeat, its task  is exclusively to blackmail the town and to kill its civilian  population. They want to keep the town dead, for as long as  there is artillery above the town we cannot open our schools,  shops, and people cannot go about their business in a normal way.    This is more or less our stand. I think that they [UNPROFOR]  can find out [who committed the carnage] but they are playing  the game of not wanting to offend the other side, they avoid  saying so. There is reliable evidence that the shell was fired  from Donji Biosak. Our experts have established this as has  UNPROFOR, but it refuses to present it as evidence. In other  words, from deep behind Serb lines. They most probably want to  leave enough room for maneuver to avoid taking any action that  will tie them down.    What can be said with certainty -- and I think our and their  experts have come to the same conclusion, but they [UNPROFOR]  refuse to say so -- is that understandably, the shell came from  Serb positions. In any case, all of the million shells that  have destroyed the city, originated from the same positions.  Why should this one be an exception? [end recording]    [Akashi -- announcer-read] Ladies and gentlemen, since this  morning I have continued my efforts with the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Presidency and the Serb side, and with the Bosnian Presidency  again to achieve a total and immediate cease-fire. I regret to  say that these talks have not resulted in an agreement. We will  have to resume efforts to find a solution acceptable to both  sides.    One of the main differences is that the Bosnian Government  wants the Serb artillery and heavy weapons deployed around  Sarajevo to be withdrawn and to be placed under UNPROFOR  supervision. This is not acceptable to the Serbs, as they put  it. I put forward some of my own ideas but no agreement was  possible.    Who do you think is responsible for the failure of the  talks?    I do not wish to blame any of the sides, but I want to  stress  that I will continue to talk until a solution acceptable to both  sides is reached. The Serbs insist that regardless of its  nature, the agreement on Sarajevo should be the first step  toward reaching an agreement on the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina.  This is one of their conditions.</p>

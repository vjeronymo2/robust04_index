			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Mr. Wally Serote, ANC's Cultural </F> Affairs Chief, by Philip de Bruin; place and date not given:  "Government Should Bring Cultures Together; White South Africans  Are Concerned About the Future of Cultural Heritage and  Symbols"]    [Text] "The top priority in my department is to see to it  that South Africa acquires a minister of art and culture.    "Historically speaking, South Africa has three cultural  pillars--that of the whites, that of the Indians, and that of  the blacks. Our task is to ensure that these three cultural  groups cooperate to such a degree that a distinctive South  African culture is created.    "To attain this goal, my department has already set up a  commission of reconstruction to determine, among other things,  what we can do to stimulate art and culture in the townships and  the rural areas, for this is where most of the people are.    "We must begin with the premise that every person has the  right to live in accordance with his own culture and to express  its outward manifestations. We must accept the fact that every  individual has the right to use his own language.    "If, for example, I want to speak Afrikaans, then I speak  Afrikaans, without apologizing to anyone.    "The role of the government will simply be to bring the  cultural groups together and to correct imbalances in the  community. There are no organized cultural activities in black  neighborhoods, for example. This state of affairs must be  remedied.    "But in the final analysis, the people have to play the most  important role. All the people of the nation must reach  consensus about how the imbalances of apartheid are to be put  right."    The ANC has definite plans concerning the continued  existence  of monuments and museums.    "The first question that has to be asked is whether the  museum in question is to have national, regional, or group  status.    "We are aware of the sensitivity and emotional content of  such issues, but everyone has to accept the fact that changes  are going to be made.    "What, for example, is to become of Robben Island? Our  contention is that it should become a monument that can serve as  a symbol of the struggle against discrimination that was waged  there.    "The museums that now exist are not representative of the  entire population. We want to change museums in places where  people can see not only objects from the past, but also  present-day items. Museums must be alive. There must be  restaurants. People from the various population groups must get  to know one another there.    "Then there is the whole question of symbolism and statuary.  The government must consult with the people of the nation on  this score. All the people of the country must be convinced of  the fact that all symbols and statues belong to everyone. This  does not mean that the Voortrekker Monument or the statue of  President Paul Kruger in Church Square, Pretoria will come  crashing down after 27 April.    "My feeling is that such monuments and statues must be left  as they are. The question is simply this: Can they always be  recognized as national symbols? Speaking of the Voortrekker  Monument, I believe that this is not the case. Existing  monuments and statues will only be eliminated if absolutely  necessary."    What about the names of symbols, cities or streets that  remind us of the apartheid era, such as the town of Verwoerdburg?    "This is once again a case where a new government must  consult with the people of the nation concerning whether or not  such names have an offensive content."    Concerning the future of Afrikaans in a country with eleven  official languages, Mr. Serote says that negotiations between  the ANC and the government for the establishment of a language  council are in progress. "We shall have to examine how each  language is used in each province, how it is used in education,  the media, and the world of work?    "But if I wish to speak Afrikaans in parliament, I must be  able to do so. If you go to see your doctor, you must be able to  communicate with him in the language of your choice. All people  feel strongly about their language. We must respect their  feelings.    "This holds true for education as well. An  Afrikaans-speaking  child must receive his instruction in Afrikaans.    Concerning the question of a national flag and anthem, Mr.  Serote says: "The ANC has put certain proposals before the  Executive Transitional Council, and the council has to make  decisions in this respect. Our proposal is that a new flag has  to symbolize unity in South Africa.    "Furthermore we have recommended six colors: green, yellow,  red, white, blue, and black.    "With respect to a new national anthem, the ANC has yet to  make its final proposals. Whether "The Voice" will survive is a  question that is still under discussion."</p>

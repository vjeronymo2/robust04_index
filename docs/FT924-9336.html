			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Further aluminium production cuts urged A CUT of another 1m tonnes in western world aluminium production next year from present levels would push the metal's price up by about 12 cents a lb to 65 cents, according to Mr Stewart Spector, the New York-based industry observer and author of the Spector Report. 'This won't make the industry solvent but at least 80 per cent of its smelters would then be operating at or above their cash costs,' he says. Mr Spector calculates that, at the present aluminium price of about 53 cents a lb, more than two-thirds of the smelters outside the former eastern bloc are operating at a cash loss. Many more are suffering losses on a full-cost basis. He suggests the industry can choose its level of prices and profits next year. But he warns that a production cut of 500,000 tonnes in aluminium ingot production would take prices only to 56 cents a lb and 'that certainly won't result in higher (aluminium company) profits in 1993'. In the second half of 1991 western aluminium producers implemented permanent closures and temporary cuts totalling 850,000 tonnes in a full year. But demand remained flat, imports from the Commonwealth of Independent States continued to flood in and aluminium stocks in London Metal Exchange warehouses are now 1m tonnes higher than in June 1991 when the first capacity cuts were implemented. So why is the industry continuing to increase production rather than make cuts? Mr Geoff Campbell, analyst at Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac banking group, points to the aluminium industry's version of Catch 22. Shutting down part of a smelter usually pushes unit costs up. Closing a complete smelter can frequently cause problems because many of the industry's big producers are integrated groups. They have downstream facilities to supply or upstream refineries supplying them with alumina (aluminium oxide). So the closure of a high-cost smelter may cause more problems than it solves. He concludes: 'The only realistic justification for reducing output is to get the aluminium price up and there is not much point closing down an operation because you won't be around to take advantage of the subsequent price rise'. And anti-trust legislation prevents producers getting together to organise between themselves an orderly shutdown of capacity. Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, the Royal Dutch/Shell offshoot, suggests: 'The onus is largely, although not exclusively, on the European producers to reduce output and return the market to balance'. He points out aluminium companies have been reluctant to act so far because of forecasts - up to the summer at least - that an economic recovery was not far away. 'The temptation to hold on in the hope that better times are just around the corner is overwhelming when the costs incurred in permanently closing or mothballing capacity are taken into account.' Mr MacMillan says that producers also had the chance to sell metal forward at higher prices earlier this year and protect themselves from the present environment to some extent. He says the market is full of rumours about more capacity cuts but 'even if they materialise, there is a real danger that we will experience a repeat of the second half of last year, when successive announcements about cuts were regarded as too little too late and prices continued to slide.'</p>

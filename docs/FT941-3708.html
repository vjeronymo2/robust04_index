			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Leading Article: A good deal for Poland Poland's agreement with the London Club for the reduction of its Dollars 13.2bn commercial bank debt is a good deal for the country. It opens the door for a resumption of lending to Poland on normal commercial terms, after a lengthy hiatus. Above all, it sends a signal to private investors that investment in Poland is a normal risk. The outline terms agreed in Frankfurt last week still have to be fleshed out by months of detailed research into the exact amounts of debt and accrued interest owed to each of the 400 or so banks involved. Warsaw also still has to make known the amount and terms of its debt buy-back. But the agreement indicates that the banks are to a write down between 42.5 and 45 per cent of the net present value of the debt. This is more generous than the secondary market had been expecting. The price of Polish debt accordingly fell after the deal was announced. Neither side obtained exactly what it wanted. The Polish team had been seeking a 50 per cent reduction, similar to that obtained from the Paris Club of official creditors on Dollars 33bn of government-backed loans three years ago. But the banks refused to be bound by the Paris Club agreement, which obliged the Polish government to seek comparable terms from the banks. While aware of the tight, IMF-approved budgetary constraints on the Polish government, the banks argued that their shareholders could not be treated in the same way as governments, which agreed to a 50 per cent write off as a political gesture of recognition for Poland's role in the downfall of communism and support for its pioneering market reforms. Three years down the road, those reforms have started to pay off. Last year Poland, with 4 per cent growth, boasted the most dynamic economy in recession-struck Europe. This year growth is expected to accelerate to 5 per cent, albeit against the background of inflation at 36 per cent last year, a 15 per cent unemployment rate and a Dollars 2.3bn trade deficit. Foreign investment is needed if such growth is to be sustained. The way that Polish companies, constrained by reluctant banks and expensive loans, have managed to fund their own expansion out of retained profits has been impressive. The explosive growth in Polish share prices is another indication that Poland's ability to finance growth out of its domestic savings may be higher than could have been imagined one year ago. But even this will not be enough. Access to international capital markets on normal commercial terms is essential if Poland is to fund the heavy infrastructure investment needed to modernise road, rail and telecommunication links, restructure the energy sector, and reduce pollution. Improved infrastructure is required if the current recovery is to be turned into sustained rapid growth. The London Club agreement will facilitate such access to foreign capital. Above all, however, the Frankfurt agreement will encourage equity investment. This is the kind of investment most needed by all post-communist countries, because it brings technological know-how, managerial skills, new exportable products and access to world markets. Until now Hungary, with a higher debt burden per head than Poland but an impeccable repayment record, and the Czech Republic have received the lion's share of inward direct investment. Now Poland, with its market of 39m people and strategic position, is poised to compete more effectively for such funds. This is one of the most important prizes Poland has earned for persevering with its painful, market-orientated reforms. Both Poland and the London Club have sent a clear and powerful message to countries like Russia and Ukraine, whose faith in market reforms, never strong, is faltering. If you stay the course, there is hope. If you waiver, the pain can only get worse.</p>

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of World Automotive Components (1): The challenge is clear, change or die - As the pressure to cut costs intensifies, the focus has sharpened on the relationship between the vehicle maker and its suppliers The world's leading vehicle makers have been preaching for several years the necessity of reforming their thorny relationships with components suppliers. Now in the face of fierce competition in the world auto industry, intensified by several years of recession, first in North America and then in Europe and in Japan, the pressures for change in the adversarial relationships of old are proving irresistible. New car sales worldwide fell for three years in succession from 1991 to 1993, and during the period red ink has been splashed over the accounts of many of the world's leading vehicle makers in the US, Japan and Europe, as well as over those of their suppliers. Demand has started to pick up, beginning in North America, but this is allowing only a short pause from the need to restructure. As the pressure to cut costs and rebuild balance sheets has grown, the focus has sharpened on to the crucial relationship between the vehicle maker and its suppliers. Well over half of the ex-factory value of a car is generated by materials, components and systems bought from the supply sector. When a vehicle maker has struck trouble, the immediate reaction has been to squeeze its suppliers, as the quickest way of reducing costs. 'More than ever automakers today recognise suppliers' impact on their cost and quality goals,' says Ralph Reins, president of AlliedSignal Automotive, a leading US component maker. 'As suppliers, we used to operate in the shadows of our customers. Business was awarded on the basis of three bids and a cloud of dust. If we happened to be the low bidder, the only challenge we faced was to build the part to the automaker's exact specifications and deliver it on time. When times were tough we took our 3 per cent price cuts, but we were rarely consulted on how to make our parts more cost-efficiently. Times have changed.' The squeeze on costs throughout the supply chain, coupled with other pressures, means that the automotive components industry is going through a period of unparalleled change and painful dislocation. At same time, significant opportunities are opening up for the companies learning most quickly to play by the new rules. The first tier of automotive components suppliers are having to establish a global presence - to meet demands from the vehicle makers for global sourcing - and they are having to enhance their research and development capabilities as they take over functions previously performed by the vehicle assemblers. Increasingly, components producers are having to develop into suppliers of systems rather than simply of components, as the vehicle makers themselves transfer operations previously carried out in-house to outside suppliers. The car makers are seeking to concentrate more and more on their own core activities of new product development (overall programme management rather than the design and development of vehicle components) and final vehicle assembly. A structure is fast emerging which reflects more closely the pyramid organisation of the Japanese industry with its tiers of suppliers. The participants in the first tier are growing in size and technological capability as they assume new responsibilities, but at the same time the number of operators in this category is falling, as the vehicle makers themselves try to rationalise their supply bases and reduce radically the number of suppliers with which they have to deal. 'These new requirements will result in a shake-out that will leave fewer than 300 truly global tier-one suppliers by 2000,' says Mr Reins. 'Those that cannot meet the demands of global sourcing, programme management and systems packaging will either drop further down the supply chain or fade away. The bottom line for suppliers today is crystal clear: change or die.' Individual car makers have already taken drastic action to cut the number of their direct suppliers from around 1,250 on average in 1988 to 900 at present, according to a report produced by the Boston Consulting Group for the European Commission. The number is expected to drop again to around 400 by 1997 and the number of companies operating as second or third-tier suppliers may fall by up to a third, warns the study. 'The European motor industry still has more suppliers than it really needs,' claims Eckhard Jokisch, vice-president of supply at Ford of Europe. 'A lot have already fallen by the wayside, because they could not even meet today's challenges and others will follow . . . Changing our philosophy from buying nationally to buying globally has already led to a reduction in numbers. Our strategy of purchasing higher levels of sub-assemblies will reduce the number of suppliers even further.' Ford has more than 700 suppliers - all in North America - for its US-built Ford Tempo/Mercury Topaz range. The successor Ford Contour/Mercury Mystique models due to be launched later this year will have only 227 suppliers drawn from around the world. The first-tier components producers are themselves being as rigorous as the vehicle makers, spreading the reduction in supplier numbers down the chain. Valeo, the leading French automotive components producer, was served by 3,500 suppliers in Europe in mid-1991, but this number has been cut to 1,800, and the aim is to reach around 1,000 by the end of 1995. The rationalisation of the industry is having severe consequences for jobs. Employment in automotive components production in the European Union could decline by at least 40 per cent up to 1999, the BCG report warns. More than 400,000 jobs are likely to be shed, as European components makers seek to close the productivity gap with the Japanese industry. Chrysler, the smallest of the big three US car makers, which was faced by renewed financial crisis at the end of the 1980s has taken a decisive lead in reforming the relationship between vehicle assembler and suppliers. 'We view our suppliers as an integral part of a value-added chain - a chain that leads not to us, but through us to the real boss, the customer. We call it the extended enterprise,' says Bob Lutz, Chrysler president. 'We treat suppliers as fully-fledged members of our platform (individual car range) teams. We have scrapped the old system of auctioning off contracts to the lowest bidder. Instead we set an overall 'target cost' for a given vehicle. And then we work with pre-selected 'supplier-partners' to arrive at mutually agreed costs for that vehicle's parts and components.' Chrysler maintains that it has made savings of Dollars 400m a year during the last four years through a programme designed to reduce supplier costs. 'Those savings came from waste reduction, not from cutting suppliers' profit margins,' insists Mr Lutz. While dramatic reforms have been put in place by some manufacturers, there is a long way to go before the new era of partnership reaches all levels of the industry. The 'necessary levels of trust' are still not present between vehicle makers and components suppliers, according to a highly critical recent report in the UK, sponsored jointly by the government and the motor industry, 'The mistrust is the result of many years of broken promises, abuse of confidence, and general acrimony in the industry,' the study prepared by Professor Richard Lamming, professor of purchasing and supply management at Bath University School of Management, reports. 'In developing new working agreements with their suppliers most vehicle manufacturers still appear to deal more in rhetoric than reality.'  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The road to tomorrow  ----------------------------------------------------------------------              Environmental measures and comfort pursuit  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- PRESENT                             FUTURE  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Engine control                      Integration with infrastructure Drivetrain control                  Traffic management Multiplex communication             Route guidance (navigation) Climate control                     Personal communication 4WS control Traction control Suspension control Cellular telephone  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Safety measures  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Airbag                              Collision avoidance Anti-lock braking                   Night vision 4-wheel steering                    Head lamp beam control Proximity alarm Tyre pressure monitor  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Nippondenso  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

We should submit to and serve such overall  interests as grasping each and every excellent opportunity to  deepen reform, expand opening up, promote faster economic  growth, and maintain stability. Moreover, we should also devote  more energies to the following key aspects of work:    1. To strive for breakthroughs in various fields and  comprehensively push forward all types of reform.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] [Correspondent T. Aldoshina] Acting  procurator-general Aleksandr Ilyushenko said today that by using  criminal terrorist methods, the criminal formations operating on  Russian territory have essentially taken over the streets,  towns, and populated localities.    [Ilyushenko] Their barefaced insolence and impunity are  creating an atmosphere of fear and helplessness in society.    [Aldoshina] Over the first five months of this year,  1,094,000 crimes were registered, 216,000 of them serious  crimes. In the view of participants in the extended sitting of  the procuracy's collegium, the federal program for combatting  crime and the president's edict on protecting the population  from gang violence should put an end to organized crime.  However, the document is controversial.    [I. Kostoyev, chairman of the Federation Council's Committee  for Constitutional Legislation] It is quite clear that the  president's edict contradicts the constitution and a number of  federal laws.    [Aldoshina] Issa Kostoyev believes, however, that the actual  state of affairs must be borne in mind and, given the outburst  of gang violence, that the edict should be used as an interim  legal enactment. Those assembled in the hall believe that it is  now a question of who will bring whom down first, the state or  the mafia? And the law enforcement bodies intend to demonstrate  their strength whatever happens.    [Sergey Stepashin, director of the Russian Federal  Counterintelligence Service] I am in favor of the violation of  human rights, if the person involved is a bandit and criminal.  There can be no alternative here.    [Aldoshina] The only person who objected to this stance was  Sergey Kovalev.    [Sergey Kovalev, chairman of the Russian Federation  President's Human Rights Commission] Human rights exist. If you  are in favor of violation of the rights of the criminal, you are  in favor of the violation of human rights. This axiom is known  worldwide.    [Aldoshina] As the acting procurator-general explained  today,  only the Constitutional Court can revoke the president's edict.  However, the participants in the procuracy collegium are fully  determined to use this document to bring the full punitive force  of the law to bear and achieve a real breakthrough in the crime  situation.</p>

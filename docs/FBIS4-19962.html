			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Dieter Kindermann: "New Border Police in the </F> Fight Against Illegal Refugees and Criminals"]    [Text] Vienna -- Interior Minister Franz Loeschnak is  determined to establish a border police consisting of 4,000 to  5,000 men that are to be recruited from the rural police and  customs officers. After Austria's entry into the European Union  [EU], their major task will be to control the 1,200-km external  EU border with the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia,  and other countries.    Loeschnak, who flew to the Nikolsdorf border crossing on  board a Bell Augusta-type police helicopter, stated: "The  control of the border by the police, customs officers, and the  Army has proven successful but is no permanent solution. Thus,  the historic opportunity that is opening up after entry into the  EU should be used to establish a uniform border police."    In the event of EU membership, controls at the border with  Germany and Italy would no longer be necessary. Redundant  customs officers might be incorporated into the border police.  Currently, 3,800 customs officers are being asked whether they  want to continue to be employed by the Finance Ministry or  whether they want to join the border police. Loeschnak  mentioned the following major reform goals:     -  The equipping  of border control offices with computers to make it easier to  call up data of wanted persons.    -  Enabling the new border police  to slowly reduce the deployment of the Army at the  borders.    -  Strengthening the border police in the fight against  crime and illegal refugees.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 28 May (MENA)--Tunisian Prime Minister Dr.  Hamed Karoui arrived in Cairo today on a two-day official visit  to Egypt.    On his arrival, Karoui stated that he was carrying a message  from Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to President  Muhammad Husni Mubarak. The message is part of the continuous  consultations between the leaders on bilateral relations, Arab  and Middle East issues, and the African summit, which is  scheduled to convene in Tunis in June.    Karoui said he will inform President Mubarak of the Tunisian  president's views and will hear President Mubarak's views on  African and international issues.    Answering a question on the situation in Yemen, he said that  developments there are regrettable. He added: We were hoping  to put the Arab house in order, but we haven't lost hope yet.  We would like the United Nations to resolve this issue despite  the fact that there are numerous issues that the United Nations  has not been able to resolve. We hope the brothers in Yemen  will manage to find a way to unite once again.    Karoui refused to comment on the secession of south Yemen.  He expressed his hope that the Yemenis will find a solution  amongst themselves.    The Tunisian prime minister concluded his statement by  saying  that his country will take part in the conference of the  Nonaligned countries' foreign ministers scheduled to convene in  Cairo on Tuesday [31 May].    Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa greeted Karoui upon his arrival.</p>

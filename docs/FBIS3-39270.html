			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Concerns in the Garment Industry"] </F>   [Text] The GATT has made the abrogation of the multifiber  accord (AMF) that has governed trade in the textile sector since  1974 official. The AMF will be reintegrated in the GATT in three  phases, over a period of 10 years.    For the time being, none of the countries have as yet  finalized their offers where the opening up of their markets is  concerned. Thus the negotiations will continue for several  months. The United States has not rejected the rate ceilings  (higher than 35 percent) applicable to the products in which the  developing countries are competitive. The garment industry, in  which the manpower criterion is particularly important, is  increasingly threatened. The very intensive manpower factor in  the clothing sector in Portugal and Greece is the source of some  concern because of the cost difference, which handicaps these  countries vis-a-vis the PVD [less-developed countries].    Although French textiles are always manufactured on our own  territory, the industrialists have already launched the process  of shifting the manufacturing of garments to the Maghreb or the  island of Mauritius, for example, GATT or no. But design and  final processing will remain in the countries paying high wages,  including France. However, "It is estimated that within five  years, almost 150,000 jobs in the textile-garment industry may  cease to exist," Georges Jolles, the new president of the Union  of Textile Industries (UIT) says. The job stakes remain  extremely important. This is the case, moreover, with the other  labor-intensive industries. The Longuet Report reminds us that  in France, the manufacturing of clocks and watches provides  7,000 jobs, the shoe industry 35,000, the paper and cardboard  industry 25,000, the tire sector 32,000, and the toy industry  8,000.    For the time being, the professionals are complaining of the  limited openness agreed to by the American, Indian, and  Pakistani governments. According to the Union of Clothing  Industries, there is a strong potential market in certain of the  developing countries where the emergence of a middle class can  be seen.    India and Pakistan have thus far refused to participate. But  the experts note that trade negotiations are not the only means  available for lowering customs barriers. The financial aid  provided to the PVD by the International Monetary Fund and the  World Bank within the framework of the "structural adjustment"  policy is often accompanied by "very firm recommendations" that  they open up their frontiers. There remains one last positive  point. Seven out of every 10 international patent infringements  pertaining to textiles involve French products. In other words,  the French industrialists will benefit from the agreements  reached on patent rights (see tomorrow's LE QUOTIDIEN).</p>

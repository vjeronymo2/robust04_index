			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Norway opts to play for high stakes in EC talks FORMAL negotiations on Norway's fourth attempt to join the European Community opened in Luxembourg yesterday, with the Norwegian government outlining tough opening positions on energy, agriculture and fisheries, regional policy, and how quickly it should become a net contributor to the EC budget. Norway is expected to catch up with the EC accession negotiations begun in February with Austria, Sweden and Finland by the end of the month. The aim is to conclude the four processes in parallel in time for referendums in each country next year, and entry in 1995. But senior Norwegian and EC officials believe Oslo's application could be the most politically complex to accommodate. After twice having applications rebuffed in 1961 and 1967, Norwegian voters rejected entry in 1972, just before the UK, Denmark and Ireland joined the EC. At yesterday's televised opening of the talks, Mr Niels Helveg Petersen, foreign minister of Denmark, which currently chairs the EC, stressed that Norway would have to accept not only all existing EC laws and regulations, but the Maastricht treaty too. Denmark, along with the UK, has still to ratify Maastricht, and both countries have secured opt-outs from its provisions being denied the new applicants. Norway, which unlike its neutral fellow applicants is a Nato member, yesterday accepted the Maastricht goals of a common EC foreign and security policy with a pronounced Atlanticist accent, and - unlike Denmark and the UK  -put itself on the list for economic and monetary union. But as Europe's largest net oil and gas exporter, Norway yesterday expressed its opposition to EC plans to legislate against countries reserving significant proportions of exploration licences for their own companies. Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, has around half of licences reserved to it. 'We are confident that our EC partners will understand how some proposals, particularly the draft hydrocarbon licensing directive - for which we see no need - give rise to serious concern,' Mr Bjorn Tore Godal, Norway's trade minister, said. He stressed that Norway would require particular understanding to preserve its Arctic farmers, its fisheries, and to underwrite its regional policies, all aimed at preserving the existing pattern of settlement of its sparse population. Sweden and Finland have brought similar problems to the negotiating table; the three countries together would increase the EC land mass by 50 per cent, but its population by only 5 per cent. But EC negotiators fear that Norway may be raising expectations the Community will not be able to meet in full. 'There's a danger they'll place the bar too high, because nobody will lift a finger to help them,' one senior Commission official said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Swiss foreign minister Flavio Cotti says talks with  the leaders of Germany, Belgium, Finland, and Denmark have  created a better climate for bilateral relations with the  European Union [EU]. Mr. Cotti was speaking after discussions  on the third day of the World Economic Forum in the Swiss resort  of Davos.    Switzerland has been negotiating for closer relations with  the EU following its rejection of membership of the European  Economic Area in 1992.    Meanwhile, the Mexican president, Carlos Salinas De Gortari,  has appealed to the forum for investment in his country. He  described the uprising of indigenous rebels in the southern  state of Chiapas as a local problem in a region of deep poverty,  and said the government was determined to reach a political  solution.    The highlight of the forum is shortly due to take place,  when  Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres meets Palestine Liberation  Organization leader Yasir 'Arafat. The two men will discuss how  to resolve differences over the Palestinian autonomy accord.</p>

			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> The Emmy Awards show was full of surprises all right. While "War and  Remembrance" won a hard-earned Emmy for best miniseries, its stars Jane Seymour  and John Gielgud lost out to Holly Hunter of "Roe vs. Wade" and James Woods of  "My Name Is Bill W." How could members of the TV academy overlook two of last  year's best performances? Perhaps they have other social/political concerns in  mind as they cast their ballots? Or maybe major "movie actors" who rarely do TV  are favored over their TV counterparts? A word to those who deserved to win but  did not: Don't be discouraged and keep up the good work. Incidentally, win or  lose, Jane Seymour undoubtedly was the most beautiful woman on Emmy night.  </P> <P> Amy Mack, Los Angeles  </P></p>

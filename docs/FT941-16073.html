			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Business and the Environment: The advantages of coming clean  -More companies are now revealing details of their environmental records Last year, BP Chemicals emitted 30 tonnes of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), six tonnes of chlorine and 711 tonnes of benzene into the environment. These and a host of other specific figures on emissions are published on a single sheet at the back of the company's annual environmental report, as well as on a computer disc. The publishing venture is among the better examples from a new set of corporate unveilings, in which companies reveal selective secrets about their environmental performance in an annual report. Most of the growing number of such reports tend to promise more than they deliver in terms of hard facts on environmental impact and what the company is doing to reduce this. Even so, they symbolise a vast step forward in business attitudes to the environment and the acceptance among certain industrial sectors that the public has a right to know what goes on behind the factory wall. Roughly 150 multinationals and a few smaller companies so far have published environmental reports. 'That's a small proportion of the approximately 40,000 big companies around the world and the millions of small and medium-sized companies,' says John Elkington, director of the consultancy Sustainability. Elkington is working with the United Nations Environment Programme to encourage more reporting, especially among companies in countries outside the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The task is enormous. For even in the western industrialised countries, most companies make only a passing - and usually vacuous - reference to their environmental responsibilities in their annual report and accounts. Many say nothing at all. A 10-country survey of leading companies by KPMG, the accountancy group, showed that only 15 per cent of the 690 companies who responded published a separate environmental report. Those were mostly in the US, Canada, Germany and the UK. This is hardly surprising. Other than specific accounting requirements in the US and Canada to disclose environmental contingencies and liabilities, companies are under no legal obligation to bare their environmental souls. Why, then, should a significant group of leading companies take the risk of publishing potentially incriminating details about their environmental performance? A glance at the different reports shows that few are as bold as British Petroleum and its fellow soul-barers such as Dow, Du Pont, ICI and IBM. Furthermore, even the most candid reports contain a good deal of public relations fudge. This is mainly because there are, as yet, no standards of reporting to which companies can conform. Standards are being developed by industry groups but it will be a long time before a universally acceptable format is available. The Netherlands is the only country close to legislating on the matter. A bill is being drafted that will force Dutch-based companies to publish detailed annual reports on the environmental impact of their activities and their plans to improve. The European Union's Eco Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS), is the only other official standard that specifies what information should be published. But membership of EMAS is voluntary. Otherwise, it is a range of market pressures - mainly the need to keep a good public image - that provide the necessary encouragement for those companies that have chosen to be in the vanguard of environmental reporting. KPMG's sector analysis shows that most companies publishing environmental reports are from the oil and gas sector, followed by chemical manufacturers and utilities. These three sectors are under the most pressure - public and legal - to reduce their environmental impact. More important, they feel they should be seen to be responding to the pressure and the most visible action is to publish a report on their efforts. But many large companies known to take their environmental responsibilities seriously still choose not to report. Among them are Hanson, Rolls-Royce aerospace, Blue Circle, Unilever, BAT and GEC. The clear difference between those companies who do publish full, regular environmental reports, and those who do not, lies in the corporate attitude to the ideas of stakeholders, the wide range of groups - employees, local communities, investors, customers, suppliers  - that can influence the fortunes of a company and are therefore said to hold a stake in it. Most leading companies view good environmental communication between themselves and their stakeholders as essential to gain or retain public confidence. Many more pay lip service to this idea. But it has been the chemical industry, which tends to suffer from a poor public image, that has led the way in publishing annual reports on environmental performance. The chemical industry trade associations, both in the US and Europe, began a 'Responsible Care' programme to improve the image. At the core was a commitment to be more open about their industrial practices and to report regularly on environmental impact. Other companies have followed the chemical sector's example, mainly for public image reasons. IBM UK, for example, publishes a regular and comprehensive report. So do British Airways and British Telecommunications. Some companies, such as the Dutch-based BSO Origin, a software services group, attempts to produce a full set of environmental accounts where the environmental impact of transport, energy use and other activities is measured in financial terms. Those companies that have published a report have been both surprised and disappointed by the muted response to their efforts. Many thought that they would have their heads shot off by the environmental groups as soon as they raised them above the parapet. But this has not happened because the information revealed, while significant for the company, has not surprised the campaign groups. Neither have the reports contained information that other readers felt demanded a response. 'There's always been a fear that if you report bad news people will jump on it,' says Peter Scupholm, head of health, safety and environment policy at BP. 'In our experience, that is not the case, as long as the reporting is balanced. I'm not aware of one negative reaction to a piece of bad news we have communicated.' Dick Robson, environment communications manager at ICI, says the company was concerned when it published its first report two years ago. 'But we recognised that it was the only way to go - we reported and our concerns have evaporated.' The first batch of environmental reports - some companies are now into their fourth year of reporting - show little consistency other than an obvious confusion about who the audience is. And because there are no standards dictating what should be revealed, the overriding feeling when looking at the reports is one of public relations gush with a strong emphasis on the positive aspects of the company's performance. 'These reports are a management tool to get employees and shareholders to feel good about the company. They are certainly not aimed at environmental groups,' says Steve Warshal, a business specialist at Greenpeace. 'But we would like more companies to report in this way because it signals that they are at least taking the environment more seriously.' This could become the case if two industry-led initiatives to formulate reporting standards are successful. One is run by the World Industry Council for the Environment, which has membership from the International Chamber of Commerce. The other, Public Environmental Reporting Initiative (Peri), was instigated in the US by Amoco, IBM and others, and is being led in Europe by BP. There are other initiatives by such organisations as the US-based Global Environment Management Initiative (Gemi) and the Canadian International Institute for Sustainable Development. But progress at producing standards is slow. This is understandable because of the complexity of the subject and the diversity of the industries involved. However, cynics in both industry and environmental groups also point to the value of keeping the initiatives in the public eye while delaying the delivery of standards. It reduces the chance of industry's nightmare coming true - laws that force companies to report truthfully on their environmental performance in a standard and comparable way.</p>

			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CONSERVATIVE JOINS WILSON PANEL;  </P> <P> POLITICS: A GLENDALE CONSULTANT ACTIVE IN THE GOVERNOR-ELECT'S CAMPAIGN IS  APPOINTED TO HIS TRANSITION TEAM.  </P> <P> A Glendale business and political consultant with strong ties to the  conservative wing of the Republican Party has been named to an advisory council  formed to assist Gov.-elect Pete Wilson in his transition to power.  </P> <P> Louis Barnett, 43, long a quiet Republican Party insider, on Tuesday became one  of 35 members of Wilson's transition team, a bipartisan group of appointees  including people in government and business, women and minorities, and experts  on education and social services.  </P> <P> The council will convene next month and disband in January when Wilson is  inaugurated, said Otto Bos, the team's director of communications.  </P> <P> Barnett said he has worked out of his Glendale house since the summer of 1989,  advising a wide range of organizations on government regulations, legislation  and marketing strategies.  </P> <P> His clients have included the Western States Petroleum Assn., nonprofit groups  such as the California Conservation Coalition and several Indian reservations,  which he tried to help with economic development projects, he said.  </P> <P> But Bos and Republican Party officials said Barnett was chosen for the advisory  team mainly because he communicates well with conservative party members.  </P> <P> "Lou has served as a very valuable sounding board for what's in the hearts and  minds of the people in the social conservative movement," Bos said. "We also  chose Lou because he served us exceptionally well on the campaign."  </P> <P> Barnett, a self-described devout Catholic who has seven children, has worked  through the state Republican Party for "traditional values" and conservative  groups, such as the California Families Coalition, he said. He is a former  national political director of Citizens for the Republic, a political action  committee formed in 1976 by former President Ronald Reagan, who was then former  governor of California and the leading spokesman for the conservative wing of  the Republican Party.  </P> <P> He has mostly worked quietly in the background for Republican Party candidates  and interests, said Dan Schnur, a party spokesman. Barnett worked as both a  volunteer and paid consultant for Wilson's campaign, recruiting support from  conservative black and religious groups.  </P> <P> Barnett said he expects Wilson, whose ideology is not as conservative as his  own, to be a "very acceptable governor."  </P> <P> "I expect Pete to go down in the record books as a proactive type of governor,"  he said. "I just think he's a prince of a guy."  </P> <P> Barnett ran for the state Assembly in 1978, losing to Assemblyman Pat Nolan in  the 41st District primary. But, he said, he is not interested in an appointment  to Wilson's staff.  </P></p>

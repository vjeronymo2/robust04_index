But Patten  said that since he didn't come to Australia seeking Keating's  support, he was not disappointed he did not receive it and was  delighted with what he described as "an extremely satisfactory  meeting."    Talks lasting 75 minutes at the prime minister's official  residence in Sydney ranged over bilateral trade links, regional  issues such as the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC)  group and Hong Kong's future after the British colony reverts to  Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Patten, who is on a six-day  official visit at Keating's invitation, told reporters his visit  was aimed primarily at persuading even more Australian  businesses to use Hong Kong as a springboard to China. [passage  omitted]    Keating has never denied reports that he told Chinese  Premier  Li Peng in Beijing last June that Australia did not support  Patten's push for greater democracy in Hong Kong. "Australia is  not particularly impressed with Patten's modus operandi or his  taking an interest in Hong Kong's political situation so late in  the peace," Keating reportedly said.    However, Foreign Minister Gareth Evans subsequently told  parliament that Australia had consistently expressed to both  China and Britain its "support for democratic reform" consistent  with the terms of the 1984 Sino-British declaration paving the  way for Hong Kong's handback in 1997. [passage omitted]    An Australian government official said later that the  meeting  had focused on the importance of economic links, but he did not  know if Keating had privately endorsed Britain's position.    "The Prime Minister underlined the importance to Australia  of  Hong Kong's continuing prosperity and stability in the  transition to Chinese sovereignty in 1997," the official said.</p>

			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Ticket discounts take centre stage: London's West End theatre managers seek to woo a wider audience how much did you pay for your ticket? - could soon echo in London's theatres. Ticket discounting has moved centre stage as West End theatre managers try to woo a wider audience. More than one in five theatregoers already pays less than the face value of tickets, according to a recent survey by the Society of West End Theatres (Swet). The trend is likely to accelerate. American Airlines has offered to develop software for Swet based on its own booking system. It would include a variety of discounts on tickets to encourage the non-theatregoer. Theatre box offices and ticket agencies have already installed computerised booking systems, promotional packages are targeting reluctant spectators and a bigger variety of ticket discounts is being offered. While the most popular shows, such as Phantom of the Opera and Miss Saigon, continue to attract the attention of touts, most theatres find it difficult to fill performances. 'Discounting has definitely become more prominent,' says Ms Susan Whiddington, development officer at Swet. 'But rather than a sign that audiences are falling, they show that theatre producers are getting more aggressive in their marketing.' Swet is planning a campaign aimed at London rail commuters which will include discount inducements. While these types of promotions are not new, the scope is. The half-price ticket booth in Leicester Square - where discounted tickets for are sold on the day of the performance - has recently moved from a pre-fab hut opened 11 years ago to a permanent building. The Leicester Square operation has attracted competition from agencies and individual theatres. Many theatres offer standby tickets, often to groups such as students and pensioners, which are sold at half price on the day of performance. Some are offering special-price days, while others have elected to break a golden rule and open on Sundays. In some London restaurants, customers find vouchers offering two tickets for the price of one. Ms Gillian Guy, the promoter responsible, says: 'Old theatregoers will always be theatregoers. What we are trying to do is tap those who think it is too expensive.' Swet says attendances were 12 per cent higher in the first quarter of 1992 than in the same period last year, when theatres were badly hit by the effects of the Gulf war. Mr Mark Watty, Swet's marketing manager, says: 'Last year showed we can't rely on the US or long-haul market any more. That's why we have to concentrate on developing and cultivating the home market.'</p>

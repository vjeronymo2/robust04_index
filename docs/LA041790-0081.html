Demonstrators gathered at the Tutow base near Neubrandenburg to demand a halt  to the use of live ammunition by planes on training flights and to call for the  closing of the base, ADN said. It said the demonstration was prompted by an  accident last week in which two missiles from a Soviet fighter plane exploded,  damaging five farm silos.  </P></p>

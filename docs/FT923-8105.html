			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Losses extended in nervous trading AN ATTEMPT to break the longest-running streak of bearish sessions in the UK stock market for at least eight years failed yesterday when the FT-SE Index suffered its seventh consecutive daily fall. The Footsie 2,300 level was challenged again in nervous trading although share prices rallied after turning down sharply when a director of Commercial Union, the UK insurance group, said that UK equities are still not good value despite the recent setback. Equities opened higher on a widely expected technical bounce which, at first, enabled London to brush aside the further losses in New York and Tokyo. Confidence was at first sustained by a firm opening in the stock index futures sector. But the early gain of 17 points on the Footsie was whittled away later and then the market began to fall away sharply. At the day's low, the Footsie was down to 2,299.3 but by the close of trading the loss had been cut to 6.5 for a final reading of 2,303.1. There appeared to be no new factors in the market yesterday. Worries over upward pressures on mortgage lending rates eased when Alliance &amp; Leicester, a leading UK building society, reduced deposit rates, rather than increased loan rates. But, in the second half of the session, confidence was jolted by rumours - quickly denied - that Mr Norman Lamont, UK chancellor of the exchequer, had resigned, and also by reports, later discounted, that Iraq had moved troops to the Kuwait border. Traders regarded the market's reaction to these fleeting and unsubstantiated rumours as an indication of its underlying lack of confidence. Even the bearish views on equities from Commercial Union were not considered, in retrospect, very different from comments made earlier in the day when the board announced satisfactory interim results. On the domestic front, investors awaited today's economic data on UK employment, wages and unit costs, which will be followed tomorrow by the July Retail Price Index. 'There really is no reason to rush to buy the UK market,' commented the head trader of a leading international house. Fears that the Footsie index remains vulnerable all the way down to 2,150 continued to haunt a now somewhat demoralised stock market. On the international front, attention is focused on the Nikkei Average which, having lost the 15,000 mark, is now believed by some analysts to be heading towards 12,500. In Europe, investors await the outcome of the referendum in France on the Maastricht treaty on September 20. Trading volume appeared to be lighter than on the previous day, although the bout of nervous selling in the afternoon lifted the Seaq total to 406.2m shares. Tuesday's Seaq volume of 564m shares reflected retail, or direct customer interest, worth Pounds 1.1bn. This figure, a return to more satisfactory levels of business from the point of view of the London-based securities houses, was clearly boosted by the two trading programmes identified in the market on Tuesday, when the institutions were selling stock.</p>

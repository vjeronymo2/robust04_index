			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi at the opening </F> session of the General People's Congress in Surt--live]    [Excerpts] In the name of God. First of all, good morning  to all of you. On the basis of an invitation from the General  People's Congress [GPC] secretariat, I have come to attend this  opening session. However, my fear is that foreign journalists  and some observers might think that the GPC is a parliament and  that I am a president. They are used to the traditional protocol  whereby the head of state chairs the opening session of  parliament. [passage omitted]    Regrettably, there are those who purposely practice  blackouts  on the people's authority and the people's direct democracy as  part of the war against small peoples' aspirations and their  attempts to liberate themselves, and as a way of belittling  peoples by insisting that only big powers can impose their  views, and that anything other than that is dictatorship. There  are some hirelings who are paid to write and talk with a view to  smearing people's authority. [passage omitted]    Other countries should take this experiment from us and  benefit from it by learning from the Libyan people. Instead,  they ridicule us from their arrogant, imperialist, and  disdainful stands. Normally, they should encourage a small  people seeking liberation. On the contrary, they are hostile to  the Libyan people and deride their experiment, so much so that  they do not talk about the people's congresses.    You have journalists here. Wait and see what they will  write. They will not refer to the people's congresses and the  people's authority. First, they will say the Libyan parliament.  Then, some will say people's committees, and this is very  deceitful. [passage omitted]    We are exposing the rancor and ill intentions of the Western  colonialist powers and their lackeys, the hireling newspapers  and agent rulers. We just want to expose them so that the  people will read these newspapers and listen to the radios and  laugh at them--the Voice of America, for example, when it says  al-Qadhdhafi the dictator. This is a great country, supposed to  be respectable, and peoples are expected to listen to its radio.  When a Libyan listens to the Voice of America he falls on his  back laughing when he hears it talk about al-Qadhdhafi, the  Libyan dictator.    Thank God, this is a privilege and a blessing enjoyed by us  Libyans in this country--love and brotherhood, and this is the  unbeatable force with which we face up to the enemies. They  have now realized that for Libya to be defeated, several million  people, four or five million Libyans must first be defeated, one  by one. But in other countries, if they topple a president then  that is it, perhaps the people... [pauses] or they could incite  a people against a president, or cause the defeat of a party in  elections, forge elections and bring in another party against  it, involve people in the farce of pluralism, bring economic  pressure to bear against them, and threaten them militarily so  as to cause the fall of a ruler, a government, or a party.  [passage omitted] This would not exist in Libya where there is  no foundation for it, because in Libya there is neither party,  nor sect, nor ruler, nor government.    These facts give strength to the Libyan side. They give us  determination and self-confidence that we will win in any  confrontation, and they undermine the will of the enemies.  [passage omitted] We are determined to enter into a  confrontation and we are 100 percent confident in victory in the  end, no matter how long the battle may be, and it should be  long. [applause] [passage omitted] We would have thought, after  the insignificant Reagan, that the American administration--the  current republic or democracy--we, and all reasonable people,  would have thought that, had there been a conscience in this  world, America would apologize to the Libyan people and to the  families of the innocent victims--children and women in Benghazi  and Tripoli--that it would give compensation to those who accept  it, and be sorry for all its life toward the Libyans and mankind  for having committed a horrible barbaric massacre against  children in 1986. On the contrary, here they are, forgetting  all this and pursuing us again, threatening us, laying siege  to us, and seeking more human victims. This means that  conscience is dead. This is a dangerous moral decline in the  world and in big powers. [passage omitted]    They are holding us responsible for Lockerbie--the Pan-Am  crash--as if our sons who died in 1986 were mice, and your sons  are human beings. What is our link with an airplane that  crashed in the North Pole? Even if we did this, they should  still be ashamed and keep quiet. They should say: we killed the  Libyans' sons in their sleep. It was a mistake. Reagan was  crazy and insignificant. He did a great deal of harm to the  American reputation in the world. He committed a horrible crime  that made America speechless and very embarrassed. Let us turn  a blind eye to Lockerbie even if the Libyans are behind it.  Despite the fact that we did not do it, they are still after  us. They are holding us responsible no matter what. [passage  omitted]    The UN Security Council asked Libya to cooperate with a  French investigation and Libya expressed its readiness to  cooperate with the French investigation and informed France.  France refused the investigation out of solidarity and linked  the UTA issue to the Lockerbie question. What is the link  between UTA in Niger and Pan-Am at Lockerbie?    France does not want a solution and took a stance which  contradicts that of the UN Security Council. If there were a  real UN Security Council which was not under Western hegemony,  it would meet and pass a resolution against France, declare  Libya not guilty, and drop this aspect from the resolutions and  the issue, considering that Libya has fulfilled its commitments  toward France and it is the latter that refused. After that the  council would have to condemn France. [passage omitted]    Yesterday, Dr. Swire, the chairman of the Association of the  Lockerbie Airliner Victims, made a proposal and said that The  Hague was an approriate place for the trial, and should the  English want to hold this trial, let them move to The Hague.  This is the chairman of the Lockerbie victims association who  said this.    They are telling the world: We, the U.S. and UK Governments,  are under pressure from the Lockerbie victims association, at a  time when the chairman of the Lockerbie victims association is  saying before the world: I am not obstinately attached to a  trial in Scotland, and even The Hague is an appropriate place.  So, their argument is no longer valid.    Should someone claim responsibility for Lockerbie now, they  would not be able to recognize their mistake. Because they have  already involved the Security Council against Libya, it would  not be able to deal with an unidentified criminal. Let us  suppose that one person was involved in the Pan-Am explosion  over Lockerbie, they would obliterate all the facts, because  this would put them in a very embarrassing position. How could  the Security Council be involved in an issue because it was told  that a country was behind it, and all of sudden an unidentified  person claims responsibility for this act? How could the  Security Council issue resolutions against this person? Would  it deprive him of spare parts? Would it break off diplomatic  relations with him, with Carlos for example? The Security  Council would become a joke in this case. Consequently, no  matter how much evidence there might be, the Security Council  would not heed them, on the orders of the Western countries, so  that they would not get into difficulties in front of the world.  It must be Libya. Even if another country were proved to be  involved, they would not admit it. It must be Libya.    This is what made the Libyan people angry; this is what made  them revolt, and prepare for confrontation. This issue has  become one of defiance, confrontation, and blatant injustice  which can only be met with resistance. [passage omitted]    There is yet another factor that had prompted the Libyan  people to engage in revolution. Now they are saying that the  Libyan people are escalating the crisis, al-Qadhdhafi is  escalating the crisis. Indeed we have been more patient than  Job. There is a saying which says: Job's patience is adoration  of God, and a fools' patience is silly. We have been patient  for a long time, and it is you [the West] that are escalating  the crisis. [passage omitted] After all this patience,  perseverance, give and take, our brandishing an olive branch,  cordiality, and even courting of the Western states, they  surprised us with Resolution 883 or I do not know which number.  Then they say the Libyans are escalating the crisis. But why  you are escalating the crisis? What do you want?    Yesterday, the UN commissioner told our foreign secretary:  you are escalating, and this is unsettling. But you, for your  part, are not you escalating? Very nice, you want us to retreat  while you escalate the crisis. So long as there is escalation  we must face up to escalation, and so long as there is  confrontation we must face up to confrontation. The Libyan  people have been wronged and must confront and resist  wrongdoing. [applause]    What made the Libyan people angry too was something at the  pan- Arab level. Brothers, these days we are hearing a slogan  being raised and we are required to carry it out. It is very  grave. It is the slogan of land for peace. This is the gravest  slogan. This misleads the revolution from Syria to Mauritania,  not just in Libya. O Arabs, the slogan of land for peace is  grave. It means that it legitimizes and permits occupation for  the realization of other objectives: you occupy land and then  pose the condition you want. If you meet their condition they  give you the land back. This is very serious. [passage omitted]    This is the gravest of slogans. The slogan of land for peace  is the gravest of slogans and it must be torn up even at the  price of millions of Arabs and a sea of blood. This slogan  should be torn asunder. It is a very serious slogan as far as  the future of the Arab nation is concerned. Land for peace?  First, according to the UN Charter acquisition of land by  force is not permitted. Therefore, the Jews have no right to  occupy Sinai or the Golan or southern Lebanon. They should  withdraw from these territories unconditionally. This was  approved by the world from the first day--the world said that  there should be an unconditional withdrawal. The withdrawal from  Sinai, the Golan, and southern Lebanon has no connection at all  with the question of Palestine.    They should withdraw from Egyptian territories  unconditionally; the enemy should withdraw from the territories  of Syria, otherwise Syria should fight this enemy to make it  withdraw unconditionally--either Syria fights this enemy or this  enemy withdraws from Syrian territories. This has no relation  whatever with recognition at all. The same applies to southern  Lebanon. With regard to the West Bank, this is part of Jordan.  Gaza is part of Egypt. In 1967 some Egyptian territories were  occupied--Sinai including Gaza. Gaza belongs to Egypt.  Throughout the years it belonged to Egypt. It was not  Palestinian land before 1967. It is Egyptian territory. The  West Bank belongs to Jordan as far as the armistice line. It  was occupied when it was Jordanian territory in 1967.    The same thing applies to the Golan--it is Syrian territory  which was occupied. Therefore it is the right of Syria, Jordan,  and Egypt to unconditionally retrieve their territories because  they were occupied by force. They will be supported in this by  the entire world. It is serious when someone deliberately  intends to occupy your land in order to impose conditions on  you. This is very serious. The Palestinian question has not  been solved; no one has touched it, either in Gaza, or in  Jericho, or anywhere else. Jericho is a spot in the West Bank  and the latter belongs to Jordan and was occupied in 1967.  Jordan has the right to demand unconditionally all its  territories which were occupied in 1967. Syria should insist on  the return of the Golan unconditionally. This has no connection  whatsoever with the Palestinian question because the Palestinian  question existed and the struggle for it existed long before the  occupation of the Golan. Sinai was occupied while the  Palestinian question was in existence; the question had no  connection whatever with the occupation of Sinai. The  Palestinian question has existed since 1948 and before, while  Sinai and the Golan were occupied in 1967. Lebanon was occupied  recently--in 1982, or what? Yesterday they occupied southern  Lebanon. It has nothing to do with the question of Palestine.  Tomorrow they may say: who has not recognized us? Libya,  Algeria, Iraq, Sudan, and so on. They have not recognized us.  All right, go and occupy part of their territories. Land for  peace--we give you your land which we occupied and you establish  peace with us. This is very serious. I am astonished--and I  call on the Ba'th Party which is ruling Syria--this pan-Arab  party for the sake of which people were imprisoned and young  people lost their future in the 1960's, while people died for  it; it used to be the party raising the banner of Arab  nationalism. It was the one which fought in Palestine.  It is not possible that the end of the Syrian Ba'th Party would  be recognition of Israel in exchange for the Golan. The Golan  should be returned either through the United Nations or through  war. The Syrian people have the right to fight to recover the  Golan. [passage omitted]    The Libyan people are ready to embark upon a long battle. By  God, even if we all die we will not accept this injustice; we do  not accept land for peace or the recognition of Israel at all.  We recognize the democratic Palestinian State which encompasses  Jews and Arabs. Israel is an innovation which we do not know,  the Israeli world does not exist in geography. [passage  omitted].    Brother ambassadors, tell the rulers who now are racing to  embrace Israelis and please the West that they might regret it;  perhaps America will blow up like the Soviet Union and you might  get up one morning and not find it there. Anything is possible  to God, and he can do this. We only believe in God who has the  power. [applause]    You might get what happened to those who were worshipping  Moscow and were saying: The great Soviet Union, the red  universe, the red flag will cover the earth and there is nothing  but Marxism-Leninism. The god of the Soviet Union died; the poor  people became orphans looking for someone to protect them. They  asked for God's forgiveness saying that they were not  communists. [passage omitted] Have no fear as your enemy, in  the first place, is an exploiting capitalist who will collapse.  Do not say that this enemy is on the ascendant. The enemy is  descending. It is on its deathbed. The entire West is  experiencing death. It is covered with a thick cover but it is  collapsing from within. [passage omitted ] Your enemy is made  of glass and will break and destroy itself.    There is now a struggle for Serbia. They are divided over  Serbia. It may appear to be a dangerous struggle and break-up  in Europe over Serbia, beginning with Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Naturally the issue does not concern Bosnia-Herzegovina. All  the others are in agreement regarding the liquidation of the  Muslims. All of them--Russia, America, and so on --have decided  not to recognize a Muslim people in Europe; Europe is 100  percent Christian--this is what they have decided.    As for the Arabs, they should accept a Jewish state in  Muscat and a racist Israeli state at that, armed with nuclear  weapons. America is pursuing North Korea and says to it: We  should inspect your installations; you should not have nuclear  weapons. Why does not America pursue the Israelis who have more  than 200 nuclear warheads? These are the things which make the  Libyan people angry. He who does not become angry is without  conscience; he is a slave. Anyone seeing this arrogance would  get angry. Is it logical to see them pursuing Korea and  leaving the Israelis? They should pursue all those who have  nuclear weapons. Look at the racist policy. When they saw  South Africa becoming a black country, they began to [word  indistinct] its nuclear capability. When the whites had that  country they turned a blind eye to it although they knew that it  was about to manufacture nuclear weapons. [passage omitted]    Recently they came to Egypt and said that that country  should  sign a treaty banning the manufacturing of chemical weapons.  Egypt told them that the Israelis have not signed anything, not  even the treaty banning the proliferation of nuclear weapons,  and now you are asking us to sign the treaty banning the  manufacture of chemical weapons. I do not sign. If there is a  state most feared by the Israelis it is Egypt. Egypt was the  first Arab state to recognize the Israelis and so on, but the  real cultural defiance felt by Egypt is not felt by any other  Arab country. Egypt knows that along its border there is a  traditional enemy. [passage omitted]    Take American justice and this young man Clinton; he is a  good man and a man of peace--he does not hate anyone in the  world, but the poor man must believe the policies the Americans  are involving us in when they tell him to go after Libya, or  Korea, or wherever, because they have nuclear weapons. Who  believes him if he does not pursue the Israelis? No matter how  good he may be, the poor man is the victim of the imperialist  policy; they treat him as they did Kennedy. They may get rid of  this poor man as they did Kennedy. If he does not go along with  them they will get rid of him.    The CIA, the American Central Intelligence Agency--I hope  someone brave will come along one day and disband and destroy  it. It is this that sabotaged the world; this notorious agency  has brought the United States into disrepute and the whole world  into disrepute. It has undermined the world. It is like  woodworm and poison. It played havoc with governments and  regimes and the economy, the dollar, and currencies and  everything. It is behind the undermining of the entire world.  One hopes that a brave man will come along and do something and  deliver America and the American people and the world of this  nightmare called CIA. It has spread its nets everywhere. You  are aware of all this. Your sons might be among those caught in  these nets. Everyone in this whole world is worried about his  children lest they get caught in the CIA's nets. The CIA is  like a deadly disease. The CIA forges money, the dollar, and  the currencies of the whole world. It has long arms and it has  devilish plots. [passage omitted] How can Clinton escape from  it, the poor man? How can he free himself of it, no matter how  good a man he may be or how much he is a man of peace? How can  he get rid of this nightmare short of dissolving it? If he did  this, he would be able to breathe easy.    There are some imperialist quarters which are very, very  dangerous and against freedom and peace. They are to be found  in America and the West and are more powerful than Clinton, more  powerful than his administration, and more powerful than anyone  who loves peace. If Abraham Lincoln or George Washington came  back to life they would be powerless unless they destroyed and  dismantled these nightmares. [passage omitted]    The same applies to America. If the National Security  Council is not dismantled, and the White House which is like the  Kremlin and the CIA which is like the KGB, no one, not the  American people, will be liberated. What kind of freedom is  this when they have these organizations? It is all lies if they  say that have a free people, a free press. It is all lies.  These claims are continually made by the West. They are the  dictatorial regimes. Yet they accuse us of dictatorship.    Generally, they are beating the drums of confrontation with  us. And not only with the Libyan people but with all the East.  They are getting ready for a crusade. You must know that,  after the end of communism, they decided to terminate Islam, the  East, and the Arab nation. That is the gist of it.    They changed their tactics. They were confronting the Soviet  Union, confrontation in Berlin, and now it has shifted to Rome.  It has become North and South. It has become East and West.  The East means the Islamic East--that is, the Arabs, or rather  the Arabs first. The front line is the Arabs. The Arabs must  be attacked and destroyed. Afterward they will go deep into  Asia and all those countries. All their actions and their  "Satanic Verses" have a great significance. We must not meet  Abu Nidal or Ahmad Jibril. I very much regret that they have  not accepted the invitation for them to come over here. They  are supposed to accept the invitation and come so that I can  meet them publicly. They are meeting with the leaders of the  IRA and yet they forbid us to do so. They receive the author of  "The Satanic Verses" who insulted Islam. Today they are making  dancing dresses with Koranic verses printed on them in France or  the nightclubs of France. One wonders if the Arabs or those who  are defenders of Islam would protest to France or break off  relations with France. They would not dare. [passage omitted]    We are warning the Egyptian people against those who have  opened fire, the Algerian people against those who have opened  fire, the Sudanese people against those who have been opening  fire, the Lebanese people who are being trampled on, the  Palestinian people who are being treated like a flock of sheep,  and the Syrian people whose land is being occupied until it  recognizes them. Tomorrow they will occupy Damascus so that they  can impose more conditions on the Syrian people. We are warning  all these people.    They destroyed Iraq and it was they who got Iraq into the  Kuwaiti mess. It was they who destroyed Kuwait, and  particularly Kuwait's oil. It was not even Saddam who set fire  to Kuwait's oil. It was set on fire by America. All the  technology which was used in burning Kuwaiti oil was Western  technology. It was deliberate and intentional. They were the  ones who set it on fire. They collaborated with Iraq, provided  it with experts, gave it the capabilities, and told Saddam to  set Kuwaiti oil on fire for reasons which concerned only them.  Iraq would need a whole year to be able to set Kuwaiti oil on  fire. It was a Western and an American action. It was  intentional. It was America who plotted for Iraq's occupation  of Kuwait. It told Iraq: In order to reward you for your war  against Khomeyni we reward you with Kuwait. Take Kuwait. All  this in order to destroy Iraq. These things are quite clear.    We are determined to live with dignity over our land. We can  never accept living on this earth while we are lacking in  sovereignty. One of us is a slave and the other is a master.  We will fight this. We prefer death to acceptance of being  their slaves, or surrendering to them, or allowing them to  impose their injustice on us. Right is turned into wrong and  vice versa.    They want to solve the Lockerbie case; there are a hundred  solutions on the table. [passage omitted]    They can go wherever they wish to go. We have decided that  we do not need the oil. Oil has now become like any other  commodity. Today we are selling a barrel of oil at $10 while  production costs are $6 per barrel. It means that a barrel of  oil brings in $4. This is nothing. What can we do with $4?  Today we are more or less living without oil because a barrel  of oil is worth $4. [passage omitted] If we sell the water of  the great man-made river we get double the price of the oil.    France does not want a solution. So be it. They do not want  friendship. Let there be hatred. They do not want peace; let  peace go to hell. What are we? Are we more desirous of peace  or friendship than they are? What is our relationship with them  ? We do not need them. That is it. We have decided definitely  to do without oil. If it continued, well and good, and if it  did not--definitely we have made our decision to live without  oil and live in the manner that suits us.    Today, we have electricity and this and that and air  conditioning units; they must not think our independence and our  freedom are dependent on them. When it comes to the real thing  and the issue becomes an issue of dignity and an issue of  existence and an issue of the future and they want on encroach  on us, to hell with all these things. We shall go back to back  to burning logs and do away with electricity [words indistinct  drowned by applause] [passage omitted].    Now they are asking why Libya has been escalating the  situation. They are doing so because they are afraid that such  an escalation would spread to other Arab countries and other  peoples.    What they would like to see is that when they attack the  rest  should surrender. Once there is someone who says no, there  should be no surrender, others might follow suit. They might  say: Look, here is someone who has not surrendered; why then  should we surrender?. And thus a new awakening might begin.    Yes, we should be exporting our people's revolution to the  rest of the Arab nation because a sin is being committed there.  First, the slogan Land for Peace must be burned. All right,  peace requires a price so let us motivate the Arab nation to pay  the price. Here we are not warmongers, as they have been  claiming, nor are we calling for the destruction of Israel or  anything like that.    However, the word Israel is a strange name which we do not  comprehend. What we know is Palestine; Jews and Arabs should  live in Palestine in a democratic state. We said this before.  Peaceful solutions should mean, furthermore, that nuclear  weapons and weapons of mass destruction must be removed from the  Israelis. A democratic state, like that in South Africa, must  be created; we should organize free elections and allow the 7  million Palestinians to return because as long as the 7 million  have not returned there will be no solution to this problem.    The Golan is, however, another problem; it is Syria's right  to demand its return or to fight until its land has been  liberated. But no one should ask it to recognize Israel at all.  Syria has every right to liberate the Golan inch by inch and no  one has any right to ask it to recongnize Israel. This is its  land; it was occupied in 1967. What is dangerous here is  linking the two things together. [passage omitted]    I would like here to salute the Libyan people for their  pan-Arabism and for understanding the aims of the plot, as well  as for their readiness for confrontation. We have no other  choice than a confrontation; we have no choices left. But if  they are looking for a solution with us they are welcome. If  they choose peace we will reciprocate. Peace be upon you.  [crowd applauds, chants]</p>

			<p><P> July 17, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> HEAVY RAIN POUNDS MID-ATLANTIC STATES  </P> <P> Heavy rain drenched parts of the mid-Atlantic states, flooding streams and  low-lying areas, and a tornado was reported in Durham, N.C. Storms were  widespread from North Carolina to New York, dumping five inches of rain at  Madison, Va., 4.25 inches at Kinsale, Va., and 3.80 at Whalleysville, Md.  Officials evacuated 18 to 20 residents of one apartment complex in Chapel Hill,  N.C., when water overflowed the banks of a nearby creek. In Granville County,  N.C., secondary roads washed out after an estimated 3.5 inches of rain fell in  six hours. In Durham, strong wind gusts up to 50 m.p.h. downed power lines and  uprooted several trees, but there were no reports of injuries. A police officer  reported seeing a funnel cloud touch down and a section of a concrete storage  building was destroyed, officials said. But the National Weather Service said  it could not confirm that a tornado had hit the area.  </P></p>

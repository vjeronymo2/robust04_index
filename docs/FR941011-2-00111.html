			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Responsibility to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Issuance of this permit by NSF does not relieve the permittee of responsibility for complying with other applicable laws and regulations or future laws and regulations that become effective during the term of the permit. However, enforcement of other applicable laws will not be taken under this permit, but will be the responsibility of the appropriate regulating body designated within the applicable law or regulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Required modification to conform with implementing legislation. In the event legislation is enacted to implement the provisions of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, and regulations are adopted thereunder governing waste disposal and waste management in Antarctica, NSF and the permittees shall discuss proposed modifications to the permit, and this permit shall be modified, if necessary, to comply with the requirements of those regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Right of entry and inspection. Any NSF employee, contractor, or agent designated by the Director, Office of Polar Programs; an Antarctic Conservation Act enforcement officer; or an NSF Representative may inspect any permitted activity and records related thereto to verify compliance with permit conditions. The designated NSF employee, contractor, or agent may take photographs, review documents, collect samples of solids, liquids or air for analysis and environmental monitoring purposes and perform other actions related to verification of compliance with permit conditions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Incorporation of 45 CFR Part 671 into permit conditions. 45 CFR 671.9, Conditions of permit, and all other provisions of 45 CFR part 671 are incorporated into this permit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Field modification of Contingency Plans. The implementation of all Contingency Plans referred to in Volume I, Chapter 6.0, ``Contingency Plans to Control Accidental Releases,'' of the permit may be affected by safety considerations; material, equipment, facility, or pipeline failure; non-availability of equipment with sufficient capacity or capability to address the release; non-availability of adequate transportation to reach or sustain work at the site; and harsh weather conditions which restrict operations. Therefore, implementation of these plans may be modified to accommodate these conditions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Development of a consolidated compliance plan. A consolidated compliance plan identifying the procedures and arrangements for managing compliance with the permit must be developed within 180 days of the issuance of this permit and submitted to the NSF. The compliance plan must include pertinent information from existing USAP management documents and subsequent documents as may be prepared. Information on fuel tank, pipeline, and associated equipment inspection, testing, and monitoring, and the frequency of these events, as well as similar information concerning the management of designated pollutants and wastes must be included in the compliance plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Changes in the total quantity of wastes managed. Projected increases in the total annual quantity by weight of antarctic hazardous wastes managed under this permit by more than 20 percent or wastes (excluding antarctic hazardous wastes) managed under this permit by more than 20 percent relative to the ``Projected Annual Waste Generation For All USAP Facilities For the Period 1 October, 1994 through 30 September, 1999'', included in Volume I Table 3&hyph;7 of the permit, shall require application for a formal amendment to this permit in accordance with 45 CFR 671.8(c). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The State Duma has adopted a political statement on  the assassination of Deputy Andrey Ayzderdzis in the Moscow  suburban town of Khimki on Tuesday night. It demands that the  Russian president, as the guarantor of the citizens' rights and  freedoms, use his constitutional powers for restoring order and  investigating this crime.    Vladimir Medvedev, the leader of the New Regional Policy  faction to which Ayzderdzis belonged, told the State Duma that  the deputies who had visited the scene of murder had established  that it was a political assassination.    Leader of the Liberal-Democratic Party's faction Vladimir  Zhirinovsky demanded that the date for signing the Civic Accord  agreement be put off until May 10, and that the deputies be  given the right to keep weapons. He also demanded an immediate  resignation of Interior Minister Viktor Yerin and expressed  readiness to become Russia's interior minister.    Interfax has learned that at its Wednesday sitting, held due  to the murder of parliamentarian Andrey Ayzderdzis, the LDPR  faction of the State Duma gave its backing to the proposal of  its leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky who demanded new elections for  the post of State Duma speaker -- now held by Ivan Rybkin.    in his interview with journalists leader of the Yabloko  faction Grigoriy Yavlinsky declared that the murder of the State  Duma deputy demonstrates once more that "today we are not ready  to sign an agreement on civic accord and it is impossible to  build such an accord on blood." He pointed out that the Yabloko  faction would support the demand for the resignation of Interior  Minister Viktor Yerin, however it would categorically oppose  attempts of individual opposition forces to dismiss Ivan Rybkin.    Yegor Gaydar, leader of the Russia's Choice faction pointed  out in his interview with journalists that the faction does not  advocate new elections for State Duma speaker, as far as the  Interior Minister is concerned, this is the prerogative of the  president.</p>

			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ON THIS DAY, DUKE KAHANAMOKU PLAYED HERO'S ROLE TO PERFECTION  </P> <P> The day, June 14, 1925, was made for legends.  </P> <P> There on the beach near the Newport harbor mouth was Duke Kahanamoku, the  Olympic swimming champion-turned-actor, lounging with a group of Hollywood  cronies who came to Newport Beach for long weekends during the summer.  </P> <P> A handful of Duke's fellow surfers also were enjoying one of those days with a  Monet sky and large, translucent waves pounding the shoreline.  </P> <P> Suddenly the serenity was shattered by a woman's screams. Someone else ran down  the beach yelling for lifeguards. In the harbor, the pleasure yacht Thelma had  capsized with 29 on board.  </P> <P> In the midst of the chaos, Kahanamoku grabbed his 114-pound redwood surfboard  and paddled through the giant breakers toward the panic-stricken victims. He  reached one, pulled him on his surfboard and then paddled toward shore.  </P> <P> He repeated the effort several times, each time rescuing more survivors as a  crowd along the beach stood and watched.  </P> <P> After the ordeal, 17 had died. Of the 12 saved, Kahanamoku had rescued eight.  </P> <P> "His role on the beach that day was more dramatic than the scores he played in  four decades of intermittent bit-part acting in Hollywood films," The Times  wrote. "For one thing, he was the star." ELLIOTT ALMOND  </P></p>

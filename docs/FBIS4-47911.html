			<p>BFN     [Text] Government and UNITA [National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola] negotiators have met to try to narrow  their differences and deal once and for all with the modalities  for the second round of presidential elections. No plausible  and conclusive progress was made at this afternoon's meeting.  The two negotiating teams will return tomorrow to the  Mulungushi International Conference Center for direct talks to  try to resolve the differences. Consensus is expected to be  reached tomorrow. This evening the two delegations will try to  improve on their ideas. Should this happen, the talks will only  need to deal with national reconciliation issues.    An official source has told us that Blondin Beye leaves  Lusaka for South Africa tomorrow to attend president-elect  Nelson Mandela's inauguration.</p>

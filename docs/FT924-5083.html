			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Letter: Tourism argument contains flaws Sir, Nicholas Lander's argument about tourism ('British tourism and the faulty towers of policy, November 24) was both useful and yet at the same time deeply flawed. It was beneficial in that it did highlight an important sector of the economy. Yet, it was also misleading: It argued that job creation in manufacturing '. . .depends on winning back export markets'. This is only partially true - a big problem for many manufacturers is to keep or win back home markets, a springboard for then building up exports in many cases. It implies that the UK could survive as a nation as a huge theme park or industrial museum. But he says nothing about the type of jobs in tourism. This has several dimensions: they may be seasonal, part time and skewed in geographical, age and gender terms. Many workers losing their jobs may not possess the requisite skills, location or inclination for employment in tourism. An interesting piece was spoiled as Lander reciprocates the faults he points out in others. Chris Rowley, lecturer, Cardiff Business School, Aberconway Building, Colum Drive, Cardiff CF1 3EU</p>

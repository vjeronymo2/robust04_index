			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chinese buying 'to underpin copper prices' THE CHINESE have returned to the London Metal Exchange as substantial buyers of copper and this should help to underpin prices, suggests Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, part of the Banque Indosuez Group. 'With the western world market copper surplus in 1992 estimated at only about 120,000 tonnes, renewed Chinese buying could see this surplus narrow considerably, which should limit the downside for prices to about 90 cents a lb in the next few months and contribute to an improvement thereafter,' says analyst Mr Robin Bhar in Carr's latest Metal Markets Insight. He forecasts that copper's price will average Dollars 1 a lb in 1992. Mr Bhar points out that copper has been in short supply in China for many years. Whereas between 1989 and 1990 output of aluminium rose by 14 per cent, that of lead by 15 per cent and that of zinc by 16 per cent, copper production was up by only 3.5 per cent. 'A continued need to import copper is therefore highly likely,' he suggests. The shortfall in copper supply was projected by CNNIEC, the government's import-export agency, to reach 220,000 tonnes in 1990. Whereas annual aluminium production capacity is expected to reach 1.3m tonnes by 1993, from 850,000 tonnes in 1990 and an estimated 1m tonnes last year, copper smelter capacity is expected to be only 665,000 tonnes by 1993, up from 560,000 in 1990. Mr Bhar says the first signs that the Chinese had started importing copper again emerged in July last year when unexpected stock falls were attributed to merchants shipping copper to China. That country was expected to take between 50,000 and 100,000 tonnes in the following 12 months. Chile Copper Corporation (Codelco) provided confirmation a few weeks ago when it indicated it was receiving heavy orders from China. Codelco sold more than 15,000 tonnes in January this year and expects to sell a similar tonnage in February, says Mr Bhar. He says there have also been suggestions that China has been importing nickel and this might be reflecting problems caused by the flooding and cave-in at its main, 20,000 tonnes a year nickel mine at Jinchuan.

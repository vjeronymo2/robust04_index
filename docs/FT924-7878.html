			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia holds key to nickel market balance, says Inco FALLING NICKEL production and record stainless steel output could contribute to an improved balance between world nickel supply and demand next year, according to Inco of Canada, the biggest producer of the metal. Inco, acknowledges however, that its forecasts depend heavily on a reduction in 'back door' exports from Russia and other parts of eastern Europe, which have severely disrupted the market this year. This material, often smuggled or disguised as scrap, has fuelled a slump in nickel prices on the LME by nearly Dollars 3,000 from the Dollars 8,500 a tonne ruling two years ago. At the London Metal Exchange yesterday the nickel price for delivery in three months fell by Dollars 32.50 to Dollars 5,590 a tonne, Dollars 50 above the 4 3/4 -year low reached earlier in the week. Mr Ivor Kirman, marketing director of Inco Europe, told an investors meeting in Toronto that the tone of the nickel market would be improved if a higher proportion of Russian exports were shipped through traditional channels, rather than the growing 'grey' market. Responding to an analyst's warning that 'if you block one hole, it will come out another hole,' Mr Kirman said that greater use of official channels by eastern European exporters 'would at least avoid confusion, corruption and demoralisation' in the market. He estimated that some European consumers now depended on supplies from the east for up to 80 per cent of their nickel needs. Inco is confident that, depending on the level of Russian exports, demand for primary nickel from western producers will be higher next year than the 1.4bn lb estimated for 1992. Cuts by suppliers in response to lower prices means that nickel supplies 'are unlikely to be greater than 1992, and could be significantly lower,' Mr Kirman said. Inco estimates total supplies this year at 1.54bn lb, down from 1.56bn lb in 1991. Inco has responded to the present glut by cutting planned 1993 production to 380m lb of finished nickel, from an estimated 405m lb this year. Mr Michael Sopko, chief executive, said that 'if over-supply continues to grow, we will take further action'. But the company also emphasised its ability to step up long-term production when the market recovered. The sites of future expansion would include PT Inco in Indonesia, the moth-balled Exmibal mine in Guatemala, two properties in Brazil, and vast reserves in New Caledonia. Inco reiterated its determination to maintain a share of about 25 per cent of the world nickel market.</p>

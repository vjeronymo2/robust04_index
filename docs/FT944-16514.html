			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Unemployment down 400,000 from peak Unemployment fell in every UK region in September among both men and women, according to figures released by the Department of Employment yesterday. The number of people out of work and claiming benefit fell by 57,879 to 2.58m, or by 28,000 to 2.57m on a seasonally adjusted basis. Unemployment has now fallen by more than 400,000 since its peak in December 1992 and is at its lowest level since December 1991. The unemployed now represent 9.1 per cent of the workforce, down from 9.2 per cent in August. The Labour Force Survey, also published yesterday, indicated that the fall in the unemployment total is at last being accompanied by a rise in employment. The survey found that employment rose by 65,000 between the spring and the summer and was 226,000 higher than in summer 1993. There was a bigger rise in male than in female employment and in full-time than in part-time work. However, the LFS results, based on interviews conducted with households, show a different result from the workforce in employment survey, which is compiled from employers and showed a 35,000 fall in employment in the second quarter of 1994. The LFS has consistently shown greater rises in employment than the other survey. Claimant unemployment has now fallen for eight consecutive months, and by an average of 25,600 over the past six months, easing earlier fears that the rate of decline might be slowing. The Department of Employment said its estimate of the trend rate of decline was 20,000 per month. However, unemployment is not falling as fast on the International Labour Office figures as it is on the official definition. Rather than measure claimants, the ILO statistics record those who say they are available, or looking, for work. On the ILO measure, unemployment fell just 11,000 between spring and summer. The Department of Employment said the smaller fall in ILO unemployment might be because people who were previously classed as economically inactive had become sufficiently encouraged by the improved economic situation to start looking for work. The number of vacancies at Jobcentres rose by 2,400 to 165,900 in September, the highest level since August 1990. However, this figure is well below the peak level of 263,000 during the mid-1980s boom. Employment in manufacturing rose by 9,000 in August, the second consecutive monthly increase. However, manufacturing employment is still 34,000 lower than in August 1993. Overtime working in manufacturing increased slightly to 8.72m hours per week, while short-term working also rose to 0.29m hours per week.  -----------------------------------------------    JOBLESS LEVELS FALL IN EVERY REGION  ----------------------------------------------- September, seasonally adjusted  ----------------------------------------------- A.

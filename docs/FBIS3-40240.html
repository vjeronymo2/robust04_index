			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Fran Visnar: "Islam's Sword in the Heart of </F> Bosnia"]    [Text] It is not hard to discover the reason why Alija  Izetbegovic is so "unrelenting" toward all the Croatian peace  initiatives and the Muslim leadership is generally self-assured  in its attitude toward continuing the war in Bosnia and  Herzegovina. In Sarajevo, they really believe in the strength of  the army they have created under difficult conditions. That is,  the Muslim side has managed by great effort and in spite of  numerous difficulties, thanks also to their own resourcefulness,  to essentially strengthen over the last few months the main body  of armed units in both materiel and personnel. Even as recently  as a year ago the Muslims were fighting in shifts, because the  total number of light weapons and infantry equipment were  sufficient only for 10,000 soldiers, although the number of men  ready to fight was 30,000. Today, the 3d Corps of the Army of  Bosnia and Herzegovina (command headquarters in Zenica) alone  has 30,000 men, officers, and noncommissioned officers.    The leading troops in the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina  trying to penetrate the positions of the HVO [Croatian Defense  Council] are the 7th Muslim Brigade, the 17th Krajina (refugee)  Brigade, and the 325th Hill Brigade. In all these units, there  are volunteers from several Islamic countries who have reached  Bosnia and Herzegovina through various channels, mainly with  authentic, but also forged, passports of Morocco, Algeria,  Tunisia, Egypt, Sudan, Yemen, Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, Iran,  Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Malaysia. Most of the Arab-Islamic  volunteers have gone through military training in their own  countries or have war experience, regardless of whether they  fought in their mother countries on the side of the guerrillas,  in the ranks of the Islamic fundamentalists, or in the forces of  law and order and the regular army.  <H5>  Trained and Fanatical </H5>   What is particularly dangerous for the Croatian side in  Bosnia and Herzegovina is the fact that these are not  adventurers, but men trained as soldiers who are convinced to a  fanatical extent that they are the "sword of Islam," and their  main driving force is "holy rage." Whether they come from  fundamentalist Muslim groups dominant at universities in Egypt  (Cairo) and Algeria or have been recruited from the lower middle  class and rural environments in the Arab-Muslim countries where  there are few places for education--they are all Islamic  militarists for whom the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina is a  complete way of life.    These men between the ages of 20 and 45 were disappointed  not  only in Nasser's type of socialism (which suffered a defeat in  Egypt, Algeria, Yemen, and to some extent Syria), but also in  the Arab type of capitalism: the inflow of foreign capital to  open luxury hotels and tourist resorts of the closed Western  type, which imports "debauchery and feverish consumerism" (and  along the way it denudes women and turns them into prostitutes),  and creates a corrupted new domestic elite whose ideology is:  "When you earn your first million dollars, you have your first  rabbit, and then you cannot stop the rabbits from multiplying."    Given the demographic explosion which has seized Egypt, for  example, and Palestinian Gaza (at the rate of one inhabitant per  minute), for the poor and disenfranchised strata Islam has  become the last refuge, exit, and chance of success: Personal  frustrations are turned into virtues. Compensation and a defense  mechanism have been found within the framework of the religion.  For many extremist Islamic groups, Iran was the ideal until  recently, and Israel and the United States were the main  enemies. Today, their ideal is shifting to defense of Islam in  Bosnia (Sarajevo is becoming the mute witness of "Islamic  perseverance" abandoned by the West), and the list of enemies  (main devils) is being extended to include the Serbs and Croats.  <H5>  The Export of Fundamentalists </H5>   Numerous Arab countries, aware of a possible fundamentalist  eruption, so that Algeria and Egypt have been turned into bombs  with a very short fuse, are trying to walk the tightrope. So,  however opposed to Islamic fanaticism they may be officially,  they will not have anything against simply exporting elsewhere  all those who want to work out their frustrations and wage "holy  war," as far from their own borders as possible and in places  when order and law are to be found in a rifle barrel.    Bosnia and Herzegovina is an ideal place where an equal sign  can be written between fanaticism, religious ecstasy, and  bravery. And because in the parliaments and political circles of  a majority of the Arab-Islamic countries almost everyone  verbally supports the Muslim side and the course of Alija  Izetbegovic, "Islamic Bosnia and Herzegovina" is becoming not  only a strong instrument for social mobilization, but also a  point of contact between the frightened regimes and the  strengthened and extremely dynamic fundamentalists (who are  making skillful use of the domestic economic problems and the  intensified social division).  <H5>  A Threat That Is Altogether Serious </H5>   It can therefore be predicted that as war flares up in  Bosnia  and Herzegovina, the inflow of Islamic volunteers will only  increase. The Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina will direct this  international flood mainly toward Croatian areas of central  Bosnia, which for the present are still offering a tough  defense. The Islamic "jihad warriors" will bring with them new  weapons, still more up-to-date systems for infantry warfare,  better equipment coming from both east and west, and they will  also be the nuclei of the leading "shock" troops, who do not  need any special morale-building or interpretation of what they  are fighting for.    The volunteers from the Arab-Islamic world, then, should be  taken extremely seriously. Neither in Zagreb nor in Grude is  there any room for naive reflections about the purpose of the  imported "jihad fighters." After all, they are more than  ordinary soldiers, and they are not conventional mercenaries.  They did not come to Bosnia and Herzegovina because of the  astronomical pay. They are all the product of their own  frustrations, which might be described this way: "They envy, but  at the same time they also hate." The violence in which they are  taking part is for them only a favorable instrument for  spreading their own ideas, to which they will certainly win over  a large portion of members of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina.    Over the long term, they can be effectively opposed only by  organized and trained military knowledge. In translation, this  means that Croatian defenders should have a better survey of the  situation, make better use of intelligence, promptly get their  bearings in space and real time, move and reorganize their units  astutely according to the situation, throw fresh reserves into  combat in good time, issue orders which are comprehensible and  not contradictory, respect the chain of command, maintain iron  discipline in units in which commanders and officers enjoy  inviolable authority because of their deeds, not their words.  <H5>  [Box, p 10] </H5> <H5>  Principles Governing the Offensive in Central Bosnia </H5>   The tactical principles of the Muslim offensive against  Croatian areas in central Bosnia (to use the official military  vocabulary of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina) are as follows:    1. Attack requires strict command, careful and complete  preparation, and at the same time action by all arms within  combat units and simultaneous action of all arms within combat  units and with neighboring units; an understanding of the  objectives of the operation and moral preparedness of the troops  are a priority. At the same time, every attack offers the  possibility of free initiative and resolute action by everyone  down to the level of the individual soldier....    2. Direct cooperation between all arms and all commanders  from the front to the rear and from the rear to the front and  flanks is necessary.... Only that kind of cooperation ("combined  action") allows the superior command to take the necessary steps  in time....    3. The objective of the attack is to penetrate as deeply as  possible into the enemy position, aiming above all at the line  of firing positions of cannon and howitzers, which must be taken  the first day.... The first breakthrough is relatively easy to  achieve. The problem lies in bringing up reinforcements at the  right time and to the right place. The enemy, surprised, must  not regain balance. His countermeasures must be repelled with  rapid development of the offensive. Everything depends on the  speed of penetration achieved by the leading troops, confident  that they will get protection of their flanks and rear and fire  support from the rear.    4. There is a high risk of the offensive smothering itself.  The critical point must be overcome through the energy of  commanders who are out in front and thanks to the stream of  fresh reinforcements from the rear.    5. The decisive factor is not the number of troops, but the  firepower of artillery and infantry. Excessively numerous forces  can hinder one another and complicate the problem of supply.  Everything depends on the rapid and independent action of all  staffs as part of a whole, and also on the ability of artillery  and the logistic chain to keep up.    6. The higher the mobility of the attack, the further  forward  the place of the superior commands is moved, often on the  "backs" of the leading troops.</p>

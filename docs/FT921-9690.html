			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Why Mr Kohl must act MR HELMUT KOHL has persuasive reasons for radiating self-satisfaction. Unlike the heads of governments of the US, Britain, France and Italy, he is not in the midst of a debilitating election campaign. He enjoys unprecedented sway over his no-longer-fractious Christian Democrats. The opposition Social Democrats are in some disarray. The domestic economy is faltering, but is not in recession. Above all, with unification tucked away under his broad belt, Mr Kohl is in the happy position of having achieved a feat of historic grandeur. Mr Kohl may not be the world's greatest thinker or orator. But he has already etched out a lofty place in the annals of German politics. The widespread perception that he is a success represents, perversely, a problem. Whatever the strains of harnessing the eastern Lander to the west, Germany's economic and social fabric is in a far better state than that of most other European countries. But Germany still faces a series of post-unity challenges which should be accorded the chancellor's urgent priority. There is a danger that Mr Kohl, in the 10th year of his chancellorship, may feel inclined simply to rest on his laurels rather than to tackle these tasks head on. He should strongly resist the temptation. German leadership is particularly required in the Gatt talks. Mr Kohl must follow up his words in favour of free trade with action to encourage a breakthrough in the Uruguay round - even if it means offending German farmers and damaging Bonn's ties to Paris. As US politicians made clear in Munich at the weekend, there is plainly a link between maintaining free trade and upholding post-Cold war cohesion within Nato. Trim spending Another pressing problem is the need to trim public spending in western Germany to bring down the large fiscal deficits which are a principal cause of high European interest rates. Two years ago, Mr Kohl failed to put budget policies on to a sounder footing to finance unity. The current Bonn impasse over Mr Kohl's plans to increase value added tax next year - blocked by the Social Democrat majority in the upper house  - threatens the strategy of controlling the deficit. The chancellor's errors in delaying necessary tax increases until after the 1990 election are, however, partly responsible for the mess. Constitutional reform More fundamentally, Germany faces the need to reform its constitution. The 1948 Basic Law served the federal republic well during 40 years of division. It now looks too rigid to meet the obligations and requirements of an enlarged, united Germany. Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, last week sensibly suggested privatising Telekom, the state telecommunications company, during the 1990s. First, though, the constitution must be altered to allow agencies like Telekom or the railways to operate outside the federal government framework. Similar adjustments are needed to bring constitutional provisions on asylum law and Bundeswehr deployment outside Nato into line with practices of Germany's partners and allies. Mr Kohl has been talking for more than a year about reform to allow Bundeswehr participation in international peace-keeping. But, highly regrettably, the chancellor now sounds as though he wants to shelve the issue until after the 1994 elections. Constitutional amendments need a two-thirds parliamentary majority, so bruising political tussles with the Social Democrats are inevitable. But the Basic Law will anyway have to be changed as part of plans for European monetary union. Mr Kohl should not duck the opportunity for a wide-ranging debate on all the issues, His country has reattained nationhood, but not yet found a role. Confusion about the part Bonn wants to play on the world stage is just one reason for international irritation over its stance on Croatia and Slovenia. If Mr Kohl can successfully direct his country towards clearer policies in all these fields, he will deserve respect and gratitude from those within and outside Germany. Otherwise, the laurels of unity may start to wilt.</p>

Asked his initial response to the contact, Han said the  results were "insufficient. But we do need to examine them."    Tom Hubbard, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state, and  Ho  Chong, deputy chief of the North Korean mission to the United  Nations, met in New York for approximately two hours.    Kim Sam-hun, ambassador in charge of nuclear issues, refused  to say what was discussed in the New York meeting but described  it as both positive and unfulfilling.    "Seoul and Washington will need to examine what went on at  Friday's meeting. Any decision has to wait until after the full  review," Kim said.    The meeting was Pyongyang's first official response to a  contact Nov. 24, where Washington explained the results of a  summit a day earlier between Seoul and Washington.    Washington reiterated two demands before the next high-level  dialogue with Pyongyang -- that North Korea allow continued  safeguards by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and  talk with South Korea on denuclearizing the Korean peninsula.    Despite reports of nearing a deadline on the issue, Foreign  Ministry officials strongly indicated that the mood in Seoul and  Washington is that the choice is still for dialogue.    "We have said all along that we will try to solve the  problem  through dialogue. This effort will continue as long as they  have a chance," Kim said.    Seoul officials refused to say which of the two demands made  progress, but a White House spokesman said North Korea did not  give any clear indications on accepting international nuclear  inspections.    North Korea has been telling the IAEA that it will allow  only  a change of films and batteries in inspection cameras, but  inside sources said it has been more flexible on the inspection  scope in contacts with the United States.    Pyongyang and Washington may hold further contacts after the  South Korean and U.S. Governments examine the results of the New  York meeting, Kim said.</p>

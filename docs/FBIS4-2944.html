			<p>BFN     [Text] Shenzhen, April 14 (CNS) -- Director of the State  Bureau of Secrecy, Mr. Shen Hongying, yesterday attended a work  meeting in Shenzhen on state secrets. He said that the special  economic development zones needed to highly emphasize and  strengthen their secrecy work.    The meeting summarized Shenzhen's present secrecy work,  indicating that the frequent foreign economic exchange of the  city, which is in the front line of China's reform and opening  to the outside world, has led to arduous and complicated secrecy  needs. Such work showed there was increasing urgency and  importance in its implementation.    The meeting stressed that the various departments should  adopt measures to strengthen and improve their secrecy work and  its inspection, paying attention to such work in key regions and  departments and in the training of security personnel.</p>

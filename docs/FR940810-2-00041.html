The purpose of this Notice is to invite the participation of Federal, state, and local agencies, affected Indian tribes, and other interested persons in the process that DOE will follow to comply with NEPA, and to solicit public comments on the proposed scope and content of the Nevada Test Site EIS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to meet present and potential future mission responsibilities at the Nevada Test Site, the Department proposes to evaluate resource management alternatives for the Nevada Test Site which would support current and future defense related missions, research and development, waste management, environmental restoration, infrastructure maintenance, and facility upgrades and alternative uses over the next 5&hyph;10 years. This Site-wide EIS will address numerous issues, including, without limitation: (1) environmental restoration and other Departmental activities at the Nevada Test Site and at off-site locations in the State of Nevada where DOE conducted nuclear experiments, which include the Project Shoal Area, Central Nevada Test Area, Tonopah Test Range, and portions of the Nellis Air Force Range; and (2) transportation and disposal of wastes, which are generated on and off-site of the Nevada Test Site.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  DOE invites and encourages the general public, other government agencies, and all other interested parties to comment on the appropriate scope and content of the EIS for the Nevada Test Site and off-site locations within the State of Nevada to ensure that all relevant environmental issues and alternatives are addressed.

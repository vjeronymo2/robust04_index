As is well known, there already are analogies of  "special regimes," but the Makhachkala one in particular  stipulates that citizens should "continuously have a passport  with them, or some other document that identifies them, and  present it at the request of workers of Internal Affairs  organs," but that "citizens who are detained without identifying  documents are subject to a fine in the amount of 10,000 rubles  [R], and, if necessary, are put into a reception-transfer center  and are kept there up to 10 days until identity is established."  The decree of the city administration prescribes that "persons  from other towns, who are in the city of Makhachkala without a  purpose, will depart for their place of residence in 24 hours"  under the threat of eviction from the city and a fine of  R10,000. For driving motor vehicles in the city without a  license, drivers are fined R100,000.    During the first 10 days about 4,000 persons went through  the  "special regime" (the population of the city is approximately  360,000), and about half of them stayed in the duty room. Six  hundred persons were fined, 128 persons were evicted from the  city, and a substantial number of volunteers left for home by  themselves. The amount of fines levied on the citizens for 10  days amounted to about R20 million.    After the introduction of the special order, the number of  recorded violations in the city increased, but they started to  be exposed less frequently. When people who had arrived for  personal or business reasons were detained without  justification, the leadership of the GUVD [Main Administration  of Internal Affairs] had to give assurances on local television  that the "special order" was not a special regime, and that  guests could come to the city freely. However, a decree of the  administration gave heads of the organs of Internal Affairs of  Makhachkala the right "to subject violators to administrative  detention of up to 10 days," which contradicts the constitution,  which permits arrest without a court order for a period of no  more than 48 hours. The chief of the GUVD admitted that  absolutely innocent citizens had run into cases of bribery of  workers of law enforcement organs.    A similar "special order" has now been introduced in the  cities of Kaspiysk and Yuzhno-Sukhokumsk. In addition, another  investigative commission from Moscow is working in Makhachkala.  This time it came from the Procuracy of the Russian Federation  on Ramazan Abdulatipov's announcement concerning the increase in  crime in Dagestan.    In particular, before the New Year a young person who had  been convicted three times was arrested on suspicion in the  murder of candidate for deputy to the Federation Council  Bayramov in Kaspiysk. While being driven to the station, he blew  himself up with a grenade and died. A judicial investigation was  assigned. Commentaries on the affair concerning Bayramov's  murder reported that he had been offered the position of  minister if he removed his candidacy.    Last week Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of  Dagestan Amirov declared that the series of attempts in Dagestan  is associated not with clan fights but with the economic  interests of those who are for the new or old system of economic  management, while associating himself with those who support the  reforms of the president and the Government of the Russian  Federation. On 2 April 1993, 27 rounds from an assault rifle  were fired at Amirov's official vehicle, one of which struck his  spine, and the deputy chairman is still undergoing treatment.    Amirov is the only one of the republic leaders who have  declared the need for a Chamber of Nationalities in the new  parliament of the republic, where equal representation of the  peoples of the republic would be guaranteed. The existence of  such a chamber would make it possible to balance the interests  of the people of Dagestan and avoid an exacerbation of  interethnic relations. At present, official circles are talking  only about "taking into account" the fact of the many  nationalities in the republic, but without guaranteeing any kind  of legal personality of the people.    The attempt on Amirov's life occurred in the evening of the  day he declared in DAGESTANSKAYA PRAVDA the need for a  representative of the people of the republic in parliament. A  session of the Supreme Soviet of Dagestan is scheduled for the  end of January, where a draft constitution and a draft law on  elections will be examined in the new parliament of the republic.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Nairobi, 20 Apr (AFP) -- Somali gunmen kidnapped  Sudan's ambassador in Mogadishu and threatened to kill him  unless a 100,000-dollar ransom was paid by Thursday [21 April],  diplomats said here. 'Abd-al-Baqi Muhammad Hasan was abducted  Tuesday by four men, who said they were from the Hawadle clan,  as he walked across the road to his office from the hotel where  he has lived since he was posted to Mogadishu a year ago. They  sent a note to the embassy office on Tuesday vowing to kill the  ambassador if the ransom was not paid within 48 hours.    A Sudanese diplomat went to Mogadishu on Wednesday to  negotiate with the kidnappers, the diplomats said. Several  foreigners including a United Nations official, a Red Cross  worker and employees of a catering firm have been kidnapped in  the past two months amid a mounting wave of lawlessness as U.S.  and other Western troops pulled out. All were freed after  negotiations through clan elders. In some cases the abductors  dropped or drastically reduced their initial ransom demands, and  none of the kidnappings seemed politically motivated.</p>

			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JIMMY CARTER ON GULF AND ENERGY  </P> <P> Regarding former President Carter's column ("A Tundra Industrial Complex? No!"  Commentary, Dec. 1) about the possibility of drilling/developing oil in more  wilderness in northern Alaska, this column could not have been more timely,  with the prospect of war with Iraq.  </P> <P> If we were to develop this pristine wilderness, only approximately .2% of U.S.  demand could come from this field during its 30-year estimated life.  </P> <P> Developing oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is strictly short-term  greed that will do very little to relieve our dependence on imported oil, but  will do long-term damage to a spectacular wilderness.  </P> <P> Having been fortunate to visit the refuge, I am one of the few who knows  firsthand the incredible beauty and abundance of wildlife there. How dare the  Reagan Administration, and now the Bush Administration, attempt to undo the  greatest environmental legislation in this century, the 1980 Alaska Lands Act,  which gave protection to wilderness areas in Alaska.  </P> <P> The fact is the U.S. is going to be dependent on foreign oil for a long time  unless we develop more efficient mileage automobiles, and are more aggressive  in developing alternative energy sources. Then we will be less reliant on  foreign oil and would not have to face the possibility of war over oil!  </P> <P> JOE FUHRMAN, Mar Vista  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 29 KYODO -- The coalition government of  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa plans to work out next week a  new round of 15-16 trillion yen pump-priming measures that will  include income tax cuts, officials said Saturday [29 January].    The officials said the decision was made at a meeting of the  Council on Economic Problems formed by the government and  parties in the ruling coalition. "A decision (on the tax  problem) will be made either Monday evening or Tuesday morning  at the latest," Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and foreign  minister, told reporters.    Shortly after a compromise political reform program was  passed by both houses of the Diet earlier Saturday, Hosokawa  told a news conference that he has no plan at present to raise  the consumption tax rate from the present 3 percent.    The officials said the council also decided to complete  fiscal 1994 budget by February 15.    Manae Kubota, director general of the Economic Planning  Agency, said it would be difficult to set any definite timing  for a consumption tax hike in view of the current economic  situation.    Government sources said the ruling coalition plans to carry  out tax cuts totaling from 6 to 7 trillion yen, separate from a  consumption tax increase. The sources said the proposed  reduction, covering both income and local taxes, will be put  into effect, retroactive to January 1, and deficit-covering  national bonds would be issued to cover revenue shortfalls.    The sources said discussions at the economic council focused  on how to raise funds for the tax cuts.    The Finance Ministry insists that the tax cuts be carried  out  in tandem with a hike in the consumption tax from the current 3  percent to 7 percent around April 1995, the sources said. They  said the ministry wants to use the revenue increase from the  consumption tax hike to redeem national bonds to be issued for  the income tax cuts.    The ruling parties, however, contend that measures to ease  the tax burden on low income earners should be taken first, the  sources said. They said discussions on the consumption tax hike  will likely be carried over into fiscal 1996.</p>

			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: Focus on Yen trade Now that fears over the future of European union have temporarily subsided, foreign exchange dealers will focus attention on the Japanese yen, writes James Blitz. Ireland's overwhelming vote in favour of the Maastricht Treaty will reduce the volatilities seen in European exchange rates in the last fortnight. This will give traders a chance to analyse the other big economic event last week: the sharp fall in the Japanese stock market to a 68-month low. The yen is being pulled in opposite directions by two factors. One is the fall in activity in the Japanese economy. This has raised fears that the Bank of Japan could ease policy, cutting interest rates and prompting a sell-off of the currency. On the other hand, there is next month's meeting of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations in Munich. There are again strong hints that the G7 will launch a concerted policy to keep the yen strong and reduce Japan's overwhelming trade surplus with the US. The upcoming week will see the release of new data on Japan's economy. Today's money supply numbers are expected to register a record low in growth terms. Later in the week, there will be Consumer Price Index and labour market data, which, despite being lagging indicators, should confirm that inflation pressures remain subdued. The dollar's weak trend, confirmed last week by a surprisingly wide US trade deficit for April, will continue through the week. Durable goods orders for May are out on Wednesday and personal consumption figures (for the same month) on Friday. But neither figure is likely to budge the view that the US economic recovery is, at best, sluggish.</p>

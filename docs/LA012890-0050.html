			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR TRAVELERS IN THE GRAY '90S, IT'S ABOUT TIME;  </P> <P> TRENDS: A POLL RECENTLY DISCLOSED THAT HALF OF ALL ADULT AMERICANS EXPECT TO  VACATION OUTSIDE THE CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES DURING THE NEXT 10 YEARS.  </P> <P> In the 1990s, America's baby boomers will come of travel age -- if they haven't  done so already. With careers largely made and earnings at a peak, the kids are  up and running. As a result, this generation is ready to explore the world in a  way that's never been done. Some travel agents are calling their big rush the  "Gray '90s."  </P> <P> What they want, according to a recent national survey of travelers and industry  experts, is travel that departs from the familiar, seeks the exotic -- and  comes with a money-back guarantee.  </P> <P> Not only will the boomers swell the ranks of leisure travelers, but half of all  adult Americans expect to vacation outside the continental United States during  the next 10 years, according to a Washington Post survey.  </P> <P> Another survey of travelers and travel experts found that about four out of  five vacationers plan to make more trips in the '90s than they did in the past  five years, and fewer than one in 12 expect to cut back on travel.  </P> <P> That survey also expected:  </P> <P>  -- Americans to travel farther for shorter periods, favoring weekend trips,  cruises and independent tours.  </P> <P>  -- Trips to be more frequent, though not necessarily less expensive.  </P> <P>  -- Airports to be as bad as ever.  </P> <P> Time, not money, will shape many travel plans. More than half of the travel  agents questioned in the Tour and Travel News and Ask Mr. Foster poll predicted  that getaways of two to five days will be the most frequently taken trips in  the early to mid-'90s, continuing a trend that began in the late '80s.  </P> <P> "Many (baby boomers) had two incomes, which means two things," said Linda Ball,  editorial director of Tour and Travel News. "They have more money to spend, and  they face the challenge of trying to coordinate two schedules."  </P> <P> In the poll nearly half of the leisure travelers interviewed agreed that  "getting away will be even more of a necessity now" than five years ago. For  some, travel literally may be just what the doctor orders.  </P> <P> "It's the stress level of modern life," Ball said. "People have more of a need  for a reality break. You used to have mental-health days, today you have  getaways."  </P> <P> All this is good news for the travel industry. Experts predict that revenue  growth will be greatest in the pricey end of the travel business.  </P> <P> The baby boomers, whose children are mostly grown and gone -- becoming what the  industry calls "untethered marrieds" -- will suddenly be freed from the need to  stay in budget motels near family oriented attractions. Increasingly, they are  likely to choose the comfort of more luxurious accommodations, if only for the  weekend.  </P> <P> That's not to say that cost will be no object. According to the Tour and Travel  poll, 78% of those leisure travelers interviewed said finding moderately priced  accommodations was important when selecting a hotel. Still, travel agents  reported that only 17% of their clients chose budget hotels and 62% stayed at  moderately priced hotels.  </P> <P> Travelers in the '90s will be much more sophisticated, according to industry  analysts, and far more demanding.  </P> <P> "Many more people have experience traveling on business and apply it to their  leisure travel," Ball said. "There's a lot more information available. And the  more information available, the smarter they get and the more demanding they  get."  </P> <P> This familiarity will breed contempt for familiar destinations, both in the  United States and abroad, and will bring an interest in adventure trips and  travel to remote destinations.  </P> <P> "There will be a richer mosaic of possibilities," Ball said. "More active  trips, not as passive as they were in the '70s. People want to go to New  Zealand to walk on the Milford Track. They're not going to Australia to look at  the kangaroos, but to scuba dive on the Great Barrier Reef."  </P> <P> This adventuresome spirit will even be part of those long weekend getaways,  which industry observers say can pack sufficient thrills into three or four  days to satisfy all but the most jaded adventurer.  </P> <P> In fact, Tour and Travel experts designed this prototype vacation based on  responses from their survey of travel agents: "A short cruise featuring  first-class accommodations and an itinerary that includes either cultural or  adventure-oriented shore excursions." The success of one-day "cruises to  nowhere" out of Miami to gamble and shop in Freeport, the Bahamas, have shown  that even day-trips don't have to be dull.  </P> <P> In the '90s many first-time travelers will get their feet wet in Fiji, not  Florida. The Tour and Travel poll showed that interest in independent and  adventure travel is exceptionally strong among those who had never traveled  extensively.  </P> <P> "What we see now among this group are people trying their first trip to some  longstanding interest," Ball said. "Sport-fishing in Belize, crafts in South  America, travel linked to some interest in their lives. The world just seems  much more accessible to people in general."  </P> <P> Older Americans, too, will seek a more active, participatory kind of travel.  </P> <P> "Ten years ago senior citizen travel was thought of as just one thing: little  old ladies with blue hair on buses, or at least that was the image," Ball said.  "Now, as life styles have changed, people have come to realize that being older  doesn't mean being passive."  </P> <P> In fact, agents surveyed reported that they expect the biggest spurt in their  business to come from so-called "mature travelers" between 50 and 70, a group  that includes the first wave of baby boomers.  </P> <P> "That will be the fastest-growing segment of the population," Ball said, "and a  lot of the wealth of the country will be centered in that group."  </P> <P> In the next 10 years travel agencies will become more traveler-friendly,  according to industry experts.  </P> <P> Agents interviewed in the Tour and Travel poll predicted a proliferation of 800  numbers to help travelers through problems on the road. And there will be more  money-back guarantees if paradise turns out to be something less.  </P> <P> "Guarantees seem to be the coming thing," Ball said. "The guarantees often  include the price of accommodations. There will be more snow-vacation packages  that will guarantee snow, more sunny places that guarantee sunshine."  </P> <P> Some travel experts are predicting that the days of the full-service travel  agency may be coming to an end; two out of three agents surveyed by Tour and  Travel News said they plan to specialize more.  </P> <P> Finding a good travel agent may become somewhat like finding a good doctor.  </P> <P> "You'll seek more referrals from your friends," Ball said. "Within a travel  agency, you'll find more individual agents specializing. Now you see cruise  specialists.  </P></p>

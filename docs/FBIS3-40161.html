In 1993 we first had freezing cold and then hail  damage and tornadoes, and with summer came disastrous floods  which caused major losses in agricultural production, personal  property and state property. Direct economic losses attributable  to these disasters amounted to more than 10 billion yuan for the  whole province. When the disasters happened, the people of the  whole province, under the leadership of the party committees and  government at all levels fought the disasters courageously to  rebuild their homes; the insurance departments played a major  role in these activities. Up to the present date, the provincial  insurance system has paid out over 150 million yuan in insurance  claims to over 6,300 afflicted enterprises in the disaster  areas, to over 120,000 households which suffered damage and for  over 4.3 million mu of damaged cropland. A great many damaged  enterprises were able to resume normal production and operations  very quickly, and the suffering people were able to stabilize  their lives in short order. Various types of post-disaster  self-help activities were able to be carried out swiftly after  the calamity. The experience in fighting and recovering from  these disasters showed the leadership at all levels and each  comrade working in the rural villages that in the countryside,  if we want to effectively organize the farmers to fight and  recover from disasters, one of the major aspects that must be  attended to is the forceful expansion of the insurance sector.  Hunan is a major agricultural province, and is one in which  natural disasters frequently occur. That we must make major  efforts to organize the farmers to prevent and recover from  disasters is commonly recognized by every level of leadership.  However, that insurance is a major link to be forged in this  major undertaking is something that some of our comrades do not  easily comprehend. From this we can see that in order to effect  a great expansion of rural insurance, the first task is for all  levels of leadership to have a correct understanding of  insurance, and a common understanding which includes grasping at  least three points of truth and fable.    1. Expansion of insurance will not hamper production, but  can  only greatly promote production.    A necessary condition for guaranteeing the smooth operation  of production and the expansion of reproduction is the  establishment of a reserve insurance fund to be used to make up  the economic losses incurred from natural disasters and  unexpected accidents. This will not only not hinder production,  but on the contrary, can only strengthen and promote production.  This is especially true in agricultural production where natural  calamities abound and to a great extent, one "depends upon  nature for food." The situation in our province last year amid  the major calamities completely substantiated this point. In  July, in Hangongdu Village, Tingcheng District of Changde City,  more than 20,000 mu of cotton was inundated, more than 5,000 mu  was flattened and died. Because they had insurance, the People's  Insurance Company paid over 950,000 yuan in compensation. The  affected cotton farmers used the advance compensation to quickly  purchase materials for resuming production, and used the  opportunity to convert the cotton fields to rice paddies and  planted over 4000 mu of rice. However, in some places insurance  is not handled well, and after a disaster even resuming normal  living is extremely difficult, much less is there a quick  recovery in production.    2. Insurance is not an added burden for the farmers, but can  only lessen their load.    Insurance is an economic compensation system, concretely  embodied in the form of a reciprocal economic contract. The  farmers take on the responsibility of paying insurance fees, and  then have the right to receive insurance compensation from the  insurance company in times of disaster. This sort of reciprocal  right and responsibility relationship is of course not the same  as the unfettered apportioning of expenses or exacting fees. A  bit of honest social enquiry will show that at the present, the  farmers' heaviest and most feared burdens are disaster without  relief, aging without caretakers, and sickness without medical  aid. When the farmers join the insurance system and pay the  small insurance fee, then when a calamity happens or the  insurance comes to full term, they can receive the corresponding  economic compensation or insurance payoff, and achieve their  goals of having compensation for disaster, care in old age and  medical care when ill. Thus, the fear of trouble dogging their  steps is eliminated and their ability to withstand risks is  enhanced. How can this do anything other than relieve the  farmers' burdens?    3. Insurance is not a governmental burden, but lessens its  worries and solves its problems.    When the populace meets with disasters and production  encounters difficulties, all levels of government must as a  matter of course fulfill their duties and responsibilities to  relieve the troubles of the people. However, the losses caused  by disasters are not problems which can be solved by relying  solely upon the limited relief funds of the government, and the  relief aid of other social departments is also extremely  limited. The positively effective method is to rely upon  insurance to mitigate the dangers, to organize a thousand  households to come to the aid of one. During the recent  disasters, the county magistrates in the areas where insurance  matters were well handled happily said: "When we saw the  insurance agents appear we gained peace of mind." "In the  disasters this year, with insurance as our backup, it was a lot  easier to be a county (village) magistrate." From this we can  see that insurance does not make trouble for the government, but  lessens the worries and solves the problems of our leaders at  all levels. Insurance benefits the farmers in many ways.  Logically speaking, every level of leadership should give full  support to insurance. However, this is not the way it works out  in real life. Some comrades talk about the importance of  insurance, but if you expect them to really give support and  aid, they are unwilling and ineffectual; in an informal setting  they will talk about the importance of insurance, but in the  formal setting with the masses they are not so bold or assured  on insurance matters. There are several problems with the line  between truth and falsehood which must be clarified if we expect  all levels of leadership to put their back into supporting the  expansion of the insurance sector.    First, we must make a clear distinction between  organizational mobilization and administrative interference, and  boldly solve the difficulties involved in expanding the  insurance sector. At present, we have a great many comrades who  are not at all clear about what sort of role the various levels  of government and the various levels of leadership should play  in economic construction under the market economy. They  onesidedly think that in running a market economy, neither the  leaders nor the governmental departments can be of much help as  far as economic work is concerned. They can think of nothing to  say and can find no place to play a useful role. Thus, when the  insurance departments mention some concrete problems and  questions which require their help in solving, they are always  unavailable and evasive, fearing that giving support to  insurance work means using administrative measures to interfere  with economic work. This sort of mindset is extremely harmful.  Insurance is a social action. We want all levels of leadership  to support the development of rural insurance so as to draw  support from administrative influence and to initiate an  effective organization and mobilization throughout society. For  instance, focusing on the problem of the weak understanding of  rural insurance, the various levels of leadership and  governmental departments can and indeed should, through  effective channels and forms, initiate a widespread propaganda  and mobilization effort directed at the farmers to enhance their  understanding of the risks involved and so voluntarily join the  insurance program. Done in this way, there is nothing they can  be reproached for. There is a fundamental difference between  this sort of work and the type of administrative interference  which forces the farmers to do this or not do that without  regard to objective conditions. For this reason, we want to make  the organization and mobilization of the farmer to voluntarily  elect to take insurance and the resolution of various problems  in the expansion of the rural insurance sector a real part of  the work of all levels of leadership and governmental  departments, and have them do this work boldly and assuredly.    Secondly, we must clearly differentiate between voluntary  uniform election of insurance and forced participation in  insurance, and boldly expand the happy circumstance of the broad  masses of farmers gladly accepting the expansion of rural  insurance. Some time ago the insurance company did some useful  exploration of the ways to organize the farmers to get  insurance. For instance, to focus on the fact that farmers'  housing is widely dispersed in many locations over a wide area,  the implementation of uniform insurance registration on a  voluntary basis, one could say, has a positive effect on the  rural insurance industry, and is a useful way to adapt to  present conditions in rural villages and expand rural insurance.  However, some people latched on to the fault that some of the  work done in the process of organizing was rather haphazard,  found grievous fault with this method, calling it forced  insuring: This is not fair. Looking at the actual situation in  our province's rural villages at the present moment, it would  seem a reasonable request to ask the insurance company to send a  person to knock on every door and collect insurance fees.  However, looking at the actual situation in the province, it  would be extremely difficult to actually do this and in some  places one can say that it is impossible to do. Even if it could  be done, it would greatly increase to the operational costs of  rural insurance and would adversely affect the accumulation of  risk funds. For this reason, on the basis of an all-round  propaganda mobilization and the voluntary participation of the  farmers, the insurance company, through its agents, conducted  uniform insurance election procedures. It is a necessary and  feasible method which cannot be simply labeled "total insurance"  meaning that it was forced insurance. At present, following  changes in governmental functions, the forms of governmental  support of insurance have seen corresponding changes, going from  direct involvement to indirect propaganda and guidance. For this  reason, we must be based on reality, and boldly expand the  beneficial situation in which the broad masses of farmers  willingly join in, taking the new path of a combination of  direct acceptance of insurance and the use of agents, and  pushing rural insurance work to ever higher levels.    Thirdly, we must make clear the relations between the  Peoples' Insurance Company and other insurance organizations,  and actively support the Peoples' Insurance Company's role as  the main channel of insurance. With the continued flourishing of  the socialist market economy, it is necessary that many more  insurance entities be fostered. However the unique aspect of  rural insurance is that the agricultural products production  process is greatly affected by the natural elements and the  rural households operate over a widespread area, so that once a  calamity hits, not only are the losses tremendous, the survey of  the damage done and calculation of compensation also requires a  tremendous amount of men and materiel. This makes it necessary  for the organization providing rural insurance to have not only  great power, but to have a vast staff of personnel and a  tremendous insurance network. Considering the several insurance  organizations which are expanding the insurance business in our  province at present, the China Peoples' Insurance Company is the  one which can satisfy the requirements of the broad masses of  the farmers. All levels of the party and government should  actively support the China People's Insurance Company's in  carrying out its work in the rural villages and playing the role  of main insurance channel. As far as those insurance  organizations which as yet are unable to provide insurance  service to the villages, all levels of the government and the  financial control departments should follow governmental  policies and regulations, actively aid in creating appropriate  circumstances, while at the same time strengthening control and  discipline, so as to unfalteringly protect the personal  interests of the broad masses of farmers.</p>

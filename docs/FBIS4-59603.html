			<p>BFN     [Text] The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, has issued  a statement renewing its rejection of the Cairo agreement that  has thrown away Palestinian rights. The agreement carries the  seeds of its failure. What took place in Cairo, the statement  emphasized, only confirms and lends legitimacy to occupation.  The anniversary of the proclamation of the Zionist entity on  our Palestinian territory, which falls tomorrow, Sunday, 15 May,  comes less than two weeks after the signing of the ill-boding  Cairo accord, and at a time when our protracted conflict with  the Zionist enemy is at a crossroads.    The scale of the fraud involving demeaning concessions that  capitulationists have sought to sell to our people is now clear  to our Palestinian Arab people, and to our Arab and Muslim  nations. They cannot any longer whitewash the sins and the  aggression they have committed against our people, cause, land,  and sacred rights.    Hamas emphasized that far from being the end of the road for  the Palestinian cause, the ill-boding agreement is only the end  of a stage. Nor does it spell our people's abandonment of the  option of jihad against the enemy, or the foreclosure of their  ambitions for which countless martyrs have fallen. The Cairo  agreement marks the end of a phase in the Palestinian case and  the end of the patriotic and militant role of the Oslo, Madrid,  and Cairo faction.    Hamas' statement undertook to pursue jihad and the fight for  liberation and to consolidate national Palestinian unity. It  promised our people to rally their jihad forces together to cope  with this decisive phase in our people's history.</p>

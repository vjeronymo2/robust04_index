			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / International Company News: Disposals keep Vard out of red Vard, the struggling Norwegian cruise group, saw pre-tax losses, before extraordinary items, widen to NKr108.4m (Dollars 16.52m) for the nine months to September, from NKr79.3m last time. However, the figures were distorted by the disposal of the ferry business and the sale of one cruise ship. This resulted in one of Vard's three cruise businesses being sold and the remaining two being reorganised. The pre-tax result, after extraordinary items, was a profit of NKr542.1m, against a loss of NKr148.9m last year. There were extraordinary gains of NKr650.4m, against charges of NKr69.6m a year earlier. Group operating profit slipped to NKr440m from NKr479m as sales fell by NKr379m to NKr5.08bn. Net profit was NKr390.28m, against a loss of NKr107.21m.</p>

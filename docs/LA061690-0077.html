			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> DINKINS BACKS OFF CRITICISM OF PUERTO RICAN NATIONALISTS  </P> <P> Under fire from Latinos, Mayor David N. Dinkins apologized Friday for offending  anyone with his criticism of three Puerto Rican nationalists but insisted that  he could not condone their violent 1954 assault on Congress.  </P> <P> At the same time, the mayor said he would make no effort to prevent Nelson  Mandela from meeting with the three when the South African anti-apartheid  leader is in the city next week.  </P> <P> "If Mr. Mandela wants to meet with them or anyone else, that's his business,"  Dinkins said.  </P> <P> The mayor touched off a furor in the Puerto Rican community when he said  Thursday that the three, whom he labeled as "assassins," should not share the  stage with Mandela in Harlem because it would detract from the purpose of the  rally.  </P> <P> What seemed to offend Latinos most was Dinkins' characterization of the  nationalists, who are free after serving prison terms, as "assassins."  </P> <P> </P></p>

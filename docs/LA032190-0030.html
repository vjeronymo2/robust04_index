			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CRASH, DIESEL SPILL CLOSE FREEWAY 5 HOURS  </P> <P> All northbound lanes of the Golden State Freeway in Burbank were closed for  about five hours Tuesday after a semi-trailer truck struck a disabled tanker  truck, rupturing it and spilling a small amount of diesel fuel, the California  Highway Patrol reported.  </P> <P> There were only minor injuries. The truck crash occurred in the outside lane  and shoulder of the freeway near the Alameda Avenue exit at 1:30 a.m., but  about 60 gallons of diesel fuel spilled across all lanes, the CHP said.  </P> <P> The lengthy closure occurred while the spill was cleaned up and the remaining  9,000 gallons in the ruptured tank were pumped into another tanker truck, Sgt.  Ron Ainsworth said.  </P> <P> Ainsworth said the tanker truck was being driven by Cesar Ernesto Acuna of  Norwalk, who tried to pull off the freeway after a tire blew out. The tanker  truck could not completely fit on the shoulder and partially blocked the  outside lane of the freeway.  </P> <P> Ainsworth said Acuna went to the rear of the disabled truck in an effort to  warn other motorists to go around it. But a semi-trailer rig driven by George  F. Kilby of Nipomo was unable to stop in time and hit the rear corner of the  tanker. Acuna was not injured. Kilby was treated at the scene by paramedics for  minor injuries.  </P> <P> The tank was ruptured and knocked off its rear axle, making it unsafe to move  until the fuel was pumped out, Ainsworth said.  </P> <P> CHP officers rerouted northbound traffic off the freeway at Western Avenue in  Glendale and back on at Orange Grove Avenue in Burbank. All lanes of the  freeway were reopened at about 6:30 a.m., but the CHP still reported a traffic  backup of more than a mile before the opening.  </P> <P> No one was cited in the accident, which remains under investigation, the CHP  said.  </P></p>

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Technology: New meaning for home computing - Worth Watching For the cost of the latest electric tool, Do-It-Yourself enthusiasts can now buy a software package to help them plan their next home improvement. The Home Series, developed by computer-aided design specialist Autodesk in Seattle, uses two-dimensional Cad techniques to enable the amateur to plan room lay-outs or even an extension. Measurements are accurate enough for an architect or builder to work from. Four modules are available for use with Dos-based PCs: home; kitchen; bathroom; and landscape, for garden design. Each module, distributed in the UK by Force 2 International, costs Pounds 59. Autodesk: US, 206 487 2233. Force 2: UK, 0844 261872. For professional Cad users, Isicad, of Wokingham, has upgraded its Cadvance software to be used with Microsoft Windows. Several drawings can be held on the screen at the same time, and sections from one cut and pasted on another. Isicad: UK, 0734 781500.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest, April 23, IRNA -- Foreign Minister 'Ali  Akbar Velyati said here Saturday [23 April] that European  countries are expected to actively participate in the on-going  efforts towards the development of the Central Asian region.    Speaking at the third general session of the Crans-Montana  Forum, Velayati said such participation will as well serve  European interests, since it brings the most needed natural  resources such as natural gas to the doorsteps of the European  countries.    "ECO (Economic Cooperation Organization) and Central Asian  countries would welcome such a multilateral cooperation," he  added.    Elsewhere, he said completion of trans Asian communication  network and its connection through iran and Turkey to the Trans  European Motorway (TEM) will provide a trans Euro-Asian network.    "In the meantime, the project of Iran-Turkmenistan gas  pipeline is designed to transfer Turkmenistan's gas to Europe  through Iran," Velayati said.</p>

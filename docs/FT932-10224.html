			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Wood seeks to swap pay for RBS equity MR Peter Wood, the director of the Royal Bank of Scotland, who is likely to earn more than Pounds 10m this year from the growth of its Direct Line insurance operation, is considering offering to swap his pay bonus contract for equity in the bank. A swap of the contract, which links his annual performance bonus to the asset growth of Direct Line, could make him one of Royal Bank's largest individual shareholders, with a stake of up to 2 per cent of its ordinary shares. Last year Mr Wood's bonus accounted for Pounds 6,014,000 of his total emoluments of Pounds 6,121,290. Mr Wood said in an interview with the Financial Times that he hoped to enter talks with the bank before its September year-end on a buy-out of his contract, agreed in 1988 when he sold it his 25 per cent stake in Direct Line. If Mr Wood exchanged his bonus contract for Royal Bank equity, it would diminish speculation that he will press for a separate flotation of the Direct Line business, which he founded in 1985 with financial backing from the bank. Mr Wood already holds more shares of Royal Bank than any of its other board directors. He had a stake of 334,610 ordinary shares at the end of 1992, which is worth Pounds 893,400 at the bank's share price of 267p on Friday. Mr Wood said he could not predict the outcome of talks, but he believed his bonus contract was worth between 1 and 2 per cent of Royal Bank's Pounds 2.1bn market capitalisation, which would give him a stake of between Pounds 21m and Pounds 42m. He said he believed there would still be larger family shareholdings in Royal Bank. The biggest institutional holders in 1992 were Banco de Santander, with 9.89 per cent, and Scottish Equitable Life Assurance, with 5.24 per cent. Mr Wood said he was keen to change his contract because the fact that he was getting cash in return for giving up Direct Line meant his pay arrangement was 'distorted' and attracted public attention he would prefer to avoid. Although there has been speculation over whether Mr Wood fits comfortably into Royal Bank, he said he was happy to work with its chief executive Mr George Mathewson, and it was now logical to consider alternatives to flotation. Direct Line was last week disclosed to have trebled first-half profits to Pounds 15m.</p>

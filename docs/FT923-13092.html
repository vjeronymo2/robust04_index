			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Cable technology rules eased THE CABLE television industry is to be freed from regulations which detail a preferred technology for the construction of cable networks. The move, announced yesterday by the Department of Trade and Industry and Oftel, the telecommunications regulator, is intended to reduce costs and boost investment in the industry. It marks a retreat from the government's policy in the early 1980s of using cable TV to bring high-technology services into people's homes. The government wanted to encourage operators to build networks using a technology called 'switched star' architecture by offering 23-year licences instead of the normal 15 years. The aims were to back a British technology and to promote advanced services such as video-conferencing, tele-shopping and telebanking. But nearly two thirds of the industry opted for the cheaper 'tree and branch' technology. Moreover, the main customer demand has been for TV and basic telephone services rather than advanced services. Yesterday's decision is designed to allow operators to determine for themselves, on the basis of commercial considerations, the best technology to use. It brings the cable TV industry into line with the government's policy of taking a technology-neutral approach to telecommunications. Oftel is to remove the detailed technical requirements on operators with 23-year licences. The DTI has also decided to increase to 23 years the licences of operators with 15-year licences to put both types of operator on the same footing. Mr Bill Wigglesworth, acting director-general of Oftel, said the move would boost investment in the already growing telecommunications sector. Mr Nick Mearing-Smith, executive group director of Nynex UK, one of the main cable industry players, said it was 'an excellent decision'.</p>

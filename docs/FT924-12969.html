			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / The UK Economy: Industrialists call for more of the same THE latest interest rate reduction was given a warm welcome by the business community last night, although there were renewed calls for additional measures to help end the recession. While the Engineering Employers Federation warned that cheaper money might feed directly through into increased consumer spending, rather than into higher investment and increased exports, retailers said improved consumer confidence was essential. Mr Brian Pitman, chief executive of Lloyds Bank, welcomed the interest rate cut but warned that it would not on its own lead to economic recovery. 'It's no longer a problem of people lacking confidence. Businesses are paralysed by uncertainty'. He added: 'Ever since Black Wednesday there has been an increase in this uncertainty'. He feared the country was locked in a 'downward spiral' and warned of the risk of a 'slump'. Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries, joined industrialists in welcoming the reduction but said 'still bolder' measures were needed. Mr Ian McAllister, chairman and chief executive of Ford of Britain, said he understood the government's need to stage rates cuts in order not to 'throw away' gains made in its anti-inflationary policy. 'We'd like to see more cuts. But they've got to be balanced against the effect on sterling and inflation,' he added. Mr McAllister also called for an increase in road-building and other capital investment programmes to give the construction and other industries a kickstart. Mr Colin Hope, chairman of motor components group T &amp; N and president of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said the cut was 'probably as much as the government can sensibly do at this time'. More cuts were needed to improve all-round confidence. The Confederation of British Industry described the cut as the move 'business has been looking for', claiming the reduction was justified by the weakness of the economy and progress in reducing inflation. Mr Peter Morgan, director general of the Institute of Directors, said the chancellor had now 'completed the interest rate action required' when the UK left the exchange rate mechanism. But the Federation of Small Businesses said it wanted rates down to 5 per cent. Sir Malcolm Field, managing director of retailers WH Smith, welcomed the interest rate cut but said it was unlikely to make a significant difference. 'It all helps but until such time as the housing market improves and people have more confidence then I do not believe it will be material,' he said. Mr John Randall, finance director of MFI, the UK's biggest furniture retailer, said he believed the interest rate weapon may now be of only limited use in stimulating consumer demand in the absence of other measures to restore growth in the economy.</p>

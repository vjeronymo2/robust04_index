			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RACING AT DEL MAR;  </P> <P> LIVELY ONE GOES IT ALONE, WINS CABRILLO  </P> <P> Trainer Charlie Whittingham proved before the race how confident he was in  Lively One's chances to win Saturday's $212,800 Cabrillo Handicap.  </P> <P> He scratched You're No Bargain, who figured to battle Speedratic for the lead  and set up the finish for Lively One.  </P> <P> "Don't need him," Whittingham said before the race. "Besides, I don't want  anyone saying my other horse needed something to soften up the pace for him."  </P> <P> Gary Stevens took Speedratic out to an easy lead, but Lively One ran him down  with a final furlong in barely 11 seconds.  </P> <P> Favored at 2-5, Lively One finished 1 3/4 lengths in front of Speedratic.  </P> <P> "We just got outrun," said Stevens, who restrained Speedratic through an  opening half-mile in :47 1/5. Under normal circumstances, such a slow pace  would put most front-runners in the winner's circle.  </P> <P> But Lively One has shown new life this summer for Whittingham, adding the 1  1/8-mile Cabrillo to his victory in the Aug. 5 San Diego Handicap.  </P> <P> Before that, the son of Halo had gone for more than a year without winning a  stake.  </P> <P> On paper, Lively One outclassed his four Cabrillo rivals. But his jockey,  Robbie Davis, was far from encouraged as the field entered the stretch.  </P> <P> "My heart was pumping turning for home," said Davis. "That other horse  (Speedratic) was hanging in game. Around the turn, I thought he'd come back to  me, but instead he opened up."  </P> <P> Davis went to work on Lively One with a right-handed whip and got an immediate  response. The 4-year-old colt kicked into another gear and passed Speedratic  without a battle.  </P> <P> Putting, a French turf horse making only his second start on the dirt, closed  well along the inside to be third, 1 1/4 lengths behind Speedratic. Honor Medal  was fourth and Rogue's Realm completed the field.  </P> <P> Lively One was timed in 1:47 and paid $3.20, $2.20 and $2.10, causing a minus  show pool that cost the track $2,311.  </P> <P> Whittingham was not sure what Lively One would be doing next, but another shot  in the Breeders' Cup Classic later in the year is a definite possibility. The  colt ran eighth in that race last year.  </P> <P> "This might have been the best race he ever ran," Whittingham said. "And he's  getting better and better."  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> Gary Stevens fell twice Saturday, in the first race immediately after the start  and in the second race, approaching the far turn, when a horse in front of him  clipped heels and fell. "It had been awhile since I'd gone down," Stevens said.  "I was trying to make up for it all at once." Depsite suffering a deep bruise  on his right upper arm, Stevens bounced back to win the third race on Stormy  But Valid and later took the ninth on Spirit Bay.  </P> <P> Apprentice Tony Guymon, whose mount triggered the second race spill, suffered a  broken collarbone in the incident. Fernando Valenzuela also went down in the  second race, but was unhurt. . . . Darrel McHargue, the Eclipse Award-winning  jockey of 1978, has his first assignment as a steward at Turf Paradise in  Phoenix beginning Oct. 6. McHargue is a patrol judge at Del Mar. . . . San  Clemente Handicap winner Darby's Daughter heads a field of nine 3-year-old  fillies in today's Del Mar Oaks. The opposition includes Stylish Star, General  Charge, Kelly, Bel Darling, Double Diplomat, Tapping Tudor and Black Stockings  and the maiden Noble and Nice.  </P></p>

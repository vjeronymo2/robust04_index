Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic and his Bosnian Muslim  counterpart Irfan Ljubijankic informed the chief diplomats of  Italy, Austria, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Slovak  Republic, Slovenia and The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  (FYROM) that the Croat-Muslim agreement was "open to the Serbs,  too."    Representatives of the Bosnian Croats, Muslims and the  Republic of Croatia signed in Washington on Tuesday, under  strong pressure from the U.S. Administration, a preliminary  agreement on a federation of the two peoples in the former  Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and a subsequent  confederation with neighbouring Croatia.    The U.S. peace negotiator for the former Yugoslavia Thorvald  Stoltenberg, who attended the session of the Central European  Initiative, set out that there was no reason to believe that the  Serbs were not ready for a peaceful solution, and underscored  that no lasting solution was possible without the Serb side.</p>

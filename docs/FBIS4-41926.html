			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Tushinskiy, Belarusian first </F> deputy minister of defense, by Colonel Valeriy Kovalev, under  the rubrics "Topical Theme" and "Newspaper Within a Newspaper --  On the Problems of the Military-Industrial Complex (Issue No.  3)"; place and date not given: "It Is Easy to Destroy  Production. It Is 100 Times More Difficult to Reestablish It"  -- from the RUSSKOYE ORUZHIYE section]    [Text] From the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA file:    A.I. Tushinskiy was born in Minsk in 1945. He graduated from  the Minsk Radiotechnical Institute. He has worked as an  engineer and chief engineer at the Minsk computer unit plant,  and then as general director of the Belorussian [Belarusian]  "Computer Technology" Production Association.    In June 1992 he was appointed Belorusian first deputy  minister of defense. He supervises questions of materiel and  technical backup for the troops, technical policy, and  conversion, and coordinates interaction between the military  department and the Republic's defense industry. He is chairman  of the Belorusian Republic Defense Ministry Scientific-Technical  Council.    [Kovalev] Aleksandr Iosifovich, how would you assess the  Republic's defense industry's potential?    [Tushinskiy] It is hard to give a simple answer to this  question today. On the one hand Belorusia has a very large  defense industry, which it inherited from the former Union. In  the times of the unified union state, 112 industrial  enterprises, scientific-research institutes, experimental design  bureaus, and construction-assembly and other organizations  worked for military needs, and over 200,000 scientists,  designers, engineers, technicians, and workers were employed in  them. Many articles that were developed and manufactured here  have no counterparts -- we were the monopolists on certain  models of combat equipment and components. But when, following  Belorusia's acquisition of sovereign state status, an inventory  of the defense industry was carried out, it turned out that it  was in a position to provide for only 3 percent of the national  army's needs in terms of weapons systems. This means around 20  models of combat equipment and weapons.    In other words, the lion's share of output manufactured at  our enterprises consisted of components -- equipment,  subassemblies, hardware, instruments, and so-called basic  supplies. That is, to put it figuratively, we turned out to be  impoverished despite our wealth: Although we have a mighty  military-industrial complex at our disposal, we can only use its  potential to a limited extent to provide for our Armed Forces'  needs. What is needed to increase that potential is a major  structural overhaul of the defense industry.    [Kovalev] And is that work being conducted?    [Tushinskiy] Yes. On the government's instructions the  Defense Ministry has elaborated a draft state weapons program  for the period through the year 2000. It was recently examined  and ratified at a sitting of the Defense Ministry Collegium.  Now it is up to the government. In brief, this program boils  down to bringing the level of supply of home-produced weapons  and equipment to the Army from the present 3 percent up to 20  percent by 2000, and considerably expanding our own potential  for repairing weapons and combat equipment and manufacturing  tool and accessories kits and spare parts. At present, our  industry and Defense Ministry enterprises can only guarantee the  repair of 2 percent of the 4,000-plus models of armaments and  military hardware making up the arsenals.    [Kovalev] In light of what you have said, I cannot help  wondering: From where will the remaining 80 percent of the  armaments systems required to maintain the Belorusian Army's  high level of combat readiness come?    [Tushinskiy] The missing hardware and armaments will, of  course, have to be purchased. And these purchases have been  built into the program. They have been specified according to  quantity, product list, and deadlines. I will tell you right  away that we are geared mainly toward Russia.    [Kovalev] But modern-day weaponry is not cheap. The  Republic is known to be in a difficult financial position right  now, and it is unlikely to be able to alter this in the next few  years....    [Tushinskiy] You are right, of course. Nevertheless, we  hope to be able to obtain a minimum of requirements for troop  back-up anyway. And, paradoxical though it may be, our defense  sector will help with this once again. The fact is that a large  part of its production used to go, indeed, still does go to  Russia -- it is our main client. And it seems that in the  future too the Russians will be interested in supplies from us,  as Belorusia has a monopoly in the sphere of developing and  producing a whole range of items of military significance. The  relevant scientific research institutes and design bureaus have  been set up, and the production technology has been installed.  In our country, for instance, many highly important elements of  space technology are produced, plus equipment for space  stations. Minsk's wheeled vehicle plant produces truly unique  multiaxled chassis for mobile strategic missile complexes,  notably for the famous "Topol" -- the RS-12M. Right now the  development of a new eight-axle chassis, unparalleled in terms  of navigability, maneuverability, and technical sophistication,  is approaching its culmination here. Belorusia does not need  such a machine, but the fact is that the commander in chief of  Russia's Strategic Missile Forces is asking for the tests and  technical refinement to be completed here in full.... The  tractor plant is producing tracked vehicles for systems no less  famous than the "Tor" and the "Tunguska." As yet there is  nothing, as far as I know, to match our automated guidance and  control systems, certain types of optical appliance, photometric  technology, or reconnaissance devices. The list goes on.    Belorusia will supply items produced here to Russian orders  and update them, and in exchange we will acquire everything that  our Armed Forces need.    I am hardly rediscovering America here, by the way: There  are agreements in this respect on questions of  military-technical cooperation between the governments of our  countries. As yet, unfortunately, they are functioning in by no  means ideal fashion.    The situation is intensified many times over by the enormous  difference in prices for energy sources and raw materials -- in  Belorusia these are somewhat higher than in Russia. Production  from our defense enterprises, as a result, is becoming too  expensive for Russian producers. But even if an order is  received and fulfilled, this still does not guarantee prompt  payment. How are workers and engineers meant to survive in such  a situation? What can be used to acquire raw materials? Or  components from subcontractors? How can the production base be  updated or even maintained at the requisite level? Unless the  situation changes, I fear that the Republic's defense industry,  even without a conversion process, will not be long for this  world....    [Kovalev] The picture you paint is not very optimistic.  Where then is the way out of the existing situation?    [Tushinskiy] The treaty signed in Moscow on 12 April this  year on a monetary alliance between our countries does inspire  some optimism. If it is introduced in full, the situation will  be rectified a little. On its own, however, this agreement is  of little use, and our governments and military departments need  urgently to sit down at the negotiating table and define their  positions on an entire range of questions linked with future  cooperation in the defense industry sphere. As a result, our  scientists, designers, and producers should get a clear,  long-term program, a state order, and the necessary financial  resources for its implementation.    Right now, as we know, Russia is striving to win back  positions lost in the world weapons market. This is undoubtedly  a worthy decision. But many components for the most modern  hardware and weaponry are produced in Belorusia. So there is a  direct link here: If our defense industry suffocates, so to  speak, and it is forced to wind down military production  completely, then Russia will inevitably lose speed in breaking  into the world market in respect of some of the most vital  positions. Moreover, this concerns the production of arms and  military hardware for their own Armed Forces, too. But if we  can achieve close coordination in the work of our  military-industrial complexes, it will prove possible to avoid  losses in both speed and quality. The two sides can only gain  from this.    [Kovalev] But will it not be the case that, while the  upper echelons are negotiating about collaboration, the  Belorusian defense sector will be reduced to precious little  more than a few nuts and bolts?    [Tushinskiy] There are, of course, grounds for such fears.  But not everything is as gloomy as it may have appeared to you  from my account. We are by no means sitting back with folded  arms. Contacts between Belorusian and Russian defense sector  workers and between the military departments, despite all the  difficulties, have not broken down. Yes, the volumes of orders  have approached a critical level, but they are still coming in.  And yes, the problem of payment defaulting is very severe; but,  as soon as our Russian partners do receive money, the first  accounts they seek to pay are those of the Belorusian suppliers.  In its turn, our defense workers do not insist on payment up  front, and they are striving to complete Russian orders in good  faith, to a high standard, and on time. At times our scientific  research institutes and design bureaus continue with promising  developments and the technical finishing of new items on the  strength of pure enthusiasm alone, so to speak. For instance,  at our proving ground equipment plant, state-of-the-art  simulators for training T-72 tank operators have just been  tested and brought into series production. They will be  supplied to Russia. We have succeeded in agreeing with our  Russian colleagues on the uncompensated exchange of technical  documentation, which is very important for us, insofar as we  intend to expand the list of types of military hardware  repairable at republic enterprises. We are holding talks with  the Russians on setting up joint ventures.    In Orsha, for instance, on the basis of the aviation repair  plant a joint venture for the repair of MiG-29 fighter aircraft  will begin to operate very soon. The Russian side will offer us  the requisite documentation and spares. A program for the joint  production in Belorusia of a dual-purpose aircraft -- suitable  for scientific and training purposes and to serve business  people -- is at the compilation stage. The aviation design  bureau headed by Aleksandr Nikolayevich Tereshchenko and a  number of Russian federation enterprises are acting as founders  of the project. And there is another joint project that we will  be starting in the near future -- recycling old munitions that  are past their storage life. We have specific projections here.  Russia has shown an interest in them. So we will pool efforts  here to our mutual advantage. We are moving toward the  flotation of defense enterprises: In particular, the Gomel  "cluster" of our military-industrial complex and Russia's  "Vympel" Science-and-Production Association are setting up a  joint stock company right now, and they will work together on  conversion programs and on the production of defense output.    In short, despite everything, the links between the defense  sectors of Belorussia and Russia have not been broken once and  for all. And, I hope, they never will be. I am convinced that  our fraternal countries will together show concern for  reinforcing the Armed Forces. As we know only too well,  something can be destroyed in the space of an hour, but  reestablishing what has been ruined takes many years and  concerted efforts.</p>

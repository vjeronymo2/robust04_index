			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Laura Ashley Laura Ashley's new company doctors are clearly learning retailing on the job. The grievous self-inflicted wound in the US - where the board started surgery before properly diagnosing the problem - shows that clearly enough. The Pounds 6.9m loss is all the more painful because it could have been avoided if the working capital problems of the US shops had been properly understood. It is also a shock that the company's internal controls were so poor. The main board seems to have had no idea that the US distribution system had been a complete shambles for years. At least the problem is now under control. Mr Jim Maxmin, the new chief executive, is taking some sensible basic steps to improve the performance of the stores. In particular, the move away from discounting towards managing the brand is surely right. Despite the company's best efforts, the Laura Ashley image has proved resilient. Many of its remaining problems can be tackled by managers rather than retailing geniuses. If the retailing operations need only a firm hand and common sense, the future of the manufacturing operations is more murky. Indeed, investors might be more prepared to back the company's recovery story with hard cash if they had a clearer view of what was going on in that area. The hope is that Mr Maxmin is in a position to tell them.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: ``Skilled Workers Are Important to Economic </F> Construction'']  [Text] The first ever China Youth Talent Olympics, jointly  sponsored by nine units including the Ministry of Labor, the  All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and the central committee  of the Communist Youth League, came to a close after nearly  three months of competition, with the outstanding achievements  of skilled contestants in ten areas of industry providing a  successful close to the competition. In June of this year, Jiang  Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, and other leading comrades each made  speeches in dedication at the opening ceremonies. Yesterday, the  contest organizing committee distributed prizes to the winners  in a solemn ceremony at the Great Hall of the People. Premier  Li Peng and other leading comrades met with the winning  contestants at Zhongnanhai. Throughout the course of the  competition, leaders from every province, city, autonomous  region, and industry showed heartfelt concern and support for  the talented stars of labor. All of this amply demonstrates that  our party and nation attaches a great deal of importance to our  nation's working class, and in particular, to the vast number of  young workers. The labor of our workers, and especially that of  our skilled workers, is the key link in transforming science and  technology into productive force, and is an important foundation  of economic growth. Without the labor of workers who possess  high quality and skill, high quality products would be  impossible, as would a soaring economy. Science and technology  is social wealth, and operational skill is also social wealth.  In a certain sense, they are important sources of wealth at a  deep level. We can introduce superb technology, advanced  equipment, effective management techniques, and the applicable  experts from abroad, but, is it possible to introduce from  abroad the vast numbers of skilled workers required for economic  construction? The superb operational skills of talented workers  can create incalculable social wealth that money cannot buy. For  this reason, Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out that, ``skilled  workers are the sine qua non of economic construction.'' This is  something we must fully recognize.p Jp People can still remember  back to the 1950's and 1960's when our nation was producing  large numbers of skillful craftsmen and ``masters of  technology'' like Li Ruihuan, Ni Zhifu, Hao Jianxiu, and Wang  Chonglun. The ``top notch work'', ``knack for getting the job  done'', and ``work style'' that these individuals demonstrated  on the production line greatly enhanced product quality and  production efficiency. Their diligent technical study and the  superb skills they attained were of monumental value in  promoting construction enthusiasm in the working classes  throughout the nation. Countless ``masters of technology'' not  only created huge amounts of material wealth for our society,  but they created precious spiritual wealth for society as well.  The party, the nation, and society as a whole attached enormous  importance to these workers. Today there are 120 million  enterprise employees and nearly 100 million township enterprise  employees in China, with 170 million of these people being  workers who are the main force behind the creation of material  wealth in society. As science and technology and the economy all  grow at a rapid pace, the demand for higher cultural and  technical quality of workers grows stronger. Yet, if we look at  the current situation in the worker ranks in China, we see that  this demand is far from being met. Looking at the make up of our  worker ranks, we find only 200,000 technicians and 2,000-plus  highly skilled technicians. If we look at the proportions of  skill capacities required for production, we find that our  technician ranks should grow to one million workers. Heightening  the technical quality of our worker ranks is indeed an urgent  mission required for development of our national economy.  Vigorous national development demands that, while we attach  importance to and give full play to the role of the  intellectuals, we also must attach importance to and give full  play to the role of the skilled workers, and this applies with  particular force to highly skilled workers. We must stress  growth in the worker ranks, we must adopt various forms, we must  pursue various routes, and we must accelerate the cultivation of  the various specialized technical workers. We must create a  social atmosphere that attaches importance to technical  operational skills and that respects technical workers. Of  course, singers, movie stars, and dancers are needed in society.  But, if ``these three stars are the only ones that shine'',  while the multitude of skilled workers and technical stars who  create immense wealth for society are busy with their noses to  the grindstone, working in obscurity, and getting the cold  shoulder, or being condemned or denounced, how is society going  to grow? We should pay more attention to shining the media  spotlight of skilled workers, we should focus the camera lens  and direct the pen more toward capturing the accomplishments of  the skilled workers and technical stars, and we should let the  people know that, without the contributions of our technical  stars and skilled workers, our society would be floundering in  emptiness as it chases its ``stars.'' At the same time, we must  call on leaders at every level to ardently show concern, to  support, and to fully use and fully reward skilled workers and  technical stars. This is an important measure that will prevent  talent drain, safeguard the enthusiasm of skilled workers, and  encourage skill growth and wealth creation on the job. Of  course, further reform of an irrational labor wage system,  destruction of the communal rice pot, and promotion of the  social status of the skilled worker remain the fundamental ways  to protect our skilled workers and induce young workers to study  technical skills. p= pI hope that the ``technical stars'' and  the ranks of the skilled workers in China expand into an  enormous and powerful force. When large numbers of ``technical  stars'' and skilled workers emerge, then the Chinese economy  will enjoy sustained, rapid, and healthy growth. We look forward  to this wonderful future!</p>

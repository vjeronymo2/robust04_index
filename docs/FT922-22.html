			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Asprey at Pounds 19.4m as recession takes toll ASPREY, the Bond Street jeweller which last year bought its rival Mappin &amp; Webb, blamed a deepening of the world recession for a 21 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the year to March 31. Profit fell from Pounds 24.4m to Pounds 19.4m pre-tax on increased sales of Pounds 107m (Pounds 100m). Mr John Asprey, chairman, said all outlets has been affected by the economic downturn. The depressed market was responsible for the closure of its Fenchurch Street branch in London in line with its rationalisation of City outlets. Most of the staff have been redeployed at its Bond Street showrooms. Earnings per share fell to 15.14p (18.54p). A same-again final dividend of 3.75p makes an unchanged total of 4.85p.</p>

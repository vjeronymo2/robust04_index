			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Lib Dems win Christchurch with 35% swing THE GOVERNMENT crashed to a record-breaking defeat in the Christchurch by-election early this morning. In the latest blow to Mr John Major's battered administration, the 15th safest Conservative seat in Britain was won by the Liberal Democrats. The surge of discontent which has driven Mr Major's popularity ratings below those of any post-war leader saw a 23,015 Tory majority at the general election replaced by a comfortable 16,427-vote Liberal Democrat victory. A swing of 35 per cent from the Conservatives was the largest in post-war politics. It exposed a middle-class backlash larger than those which triggered the crushing Tory defeats at Torrington in 1958, Sutton and Cheam in 1972 and Newbury in May of this year. The 20,000 fall in the Conservative vote was also the steepest in recent history, forcing Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman to concede that it was 'a very bad result indeed'. It will intensify calls from Conservative MPs for the government to abandon the planned imposition of VAT on domestic fuel. But that option was ruled out immediately by Sir Norman. After a wretched year of electoral defeats and political U-turns the only consolation for Mr Major was a complete collapse in Christchurch of the Labour vote. But the humiliating defeat in his party's electoral heartlands still left Mr Major facing the threat of an autumn of discontent among Conservative party activists. His Commons majority has been reduced to 17 and the possibility of another turbulent party conference in October and of a tough November Budget will maintain the present question mark over his leadership. The outcome intensified government fears that Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats, victors in Newbury and in the county council elections in May, are poised to make permanent inroads into the government's southern strongholds. Christchurch had been held continuously by the Conservatives since 1910. Mrs Diana Maddock, the Liberal Democrat candidate, secured 33,164 votes (13,612 in 1992) against the 16,737 (36,627 in 1992) won by Mr Rob Hayward, the Conservative candidate. As expected, the Labour vote was squeezed by the two other parties with Mr Nigel Lickley getting only 1,453 votes (6,997 in 1992), losing his deposit. The turnout of 74.3 per cent was below the 80.7 per cent in the general election but still high for a by-election. Ministers hope the long summer parliamentary recess will provide a breathing space for Mr Major to capitalise on the end of his party's civil war over Maastricht and on the economic recovery. They were also taking comfort from the fact that the defeat had been heavily discounted. But the intense public anger in Christchurch over imposition of VAT on domestic fuel and over threatened cuts in welfare spending will complicate greatly the task of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, in framing his November Budget. As Mr Clarke prepared for a pre-Budget planning session at his Dorneywood country house later today, the expectation in Whitehall was that he would find it impossible to avoid some further increase in taxation to curb the government's massive borrowing requirement. The chancellor has indicated that he is not prepared to retreat from the extension of VAT to domestic fuel, but he will now face intense pressure to use much of the revenue in a generous compensation package for the less well-off. The humiliation in Christchurch will strengthen Mr Major's antipathy to further extensions of VAT and to reductions in welfare spending which fall heavily on the party's traditional supporters among the middle classes and the elderly. With the Liberal Democrats' standing in southern England now at its highest since the early 1980s, Mr Ashdown will seize on his victory to claim that his party offers the only credible alternative to the Conservatives in their traditional heartlands. Mrs Maddock warned Mr Major that the message of the result was that he must 'change your policies or change your job'. Sir Norman acknowledged that the result in Christchurch will provoke an intensive post-mortem in the highest ranks of the party. Although the swing of 35 per cent was the largest against an incumbent Tory government, it did fall short of the 44.2 per cent swing against Labour in 1983 when the Liberal Democrats captured Bermondsey.

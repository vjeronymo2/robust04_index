			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Andreotti denies Mafia charge: Former PM angered by Sicily's moves to put him on trial Mr Giulio Andreotti, seven times prime minister of Italy, has condemned as 'absurd and unfounded' charges that he had links with the Mafia, following Saturday's call by Sicilian magistrates that he should stand trial. Most of yesterday's Italian newspapers carried interviews with Mr Andreotti, 75, a life member of Italy's upper house of parliament, in which he talked of his 'bitterness' about the Palermo magistrates decision, which leaked out on Saturday. The magistrates will this week ask their judicial superiors to order the trial of Mr Andreotti, which would be one of the most sensational court cases ever to be held in Italy. But the former Christian Democrat prime minister also said he was relieved that he would be able to reply publicly to the charges, more than a year after he was told that he was being investigated. 'Obviously I would have preferred the prosecutors to shelve the case, and it would have been the logical conclusion from my point of view,' Mr Andreotti told La Stampa. 'However I understand, given the way in which they started off the procedure - accusing me of being the 'Roman centre' for all Mafia business - it wasn't easy to turn back.' The Palermo magistrates, working on the basis of confessions from Mafia pentiti, have alleged that Mr Andreotti consorted with gang bosses, and even kissed top Mafia boss Mr Salvatore 'Toto' Riina, as a mark of respect, at a meeting in 1987. The former prime minister again denied at the weekend that it would have been possible for him to shake off his police escort for such a meeting. Mr Andreotti has resolutely refused to give up the political limelight since the Palermo magistrates' investigation first came to light. Last week he was prominent in the senate, the Italian parliament's upper house, when he opposed the new right-wing government of Mr Silvio Berlusconi in a vote of confidence. Mr Antonio Martino, Italy's foreign minister, yesterday flew to Washington to reassure the US administration over the policies of its new conservative coalition, which includes neo-fascists for the first time in 50 years, Reuter reports from Rome. Mr Martino, a member of the Forza Italia party of the prime minister, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, will hold talks with the US secretary of state, Mr Warren Christopher, and the national security adviser, Mr Anthony Lake. The foreign minister is visiting Washington at a time of international concern over the presence of five ministers from the neo-fascist-led National Alliance (NA) in Mr Berlusconi's coalition, which also includes the federalist Northern League. Three of the five NA ministers are from the Italian Social Movement. Mr Martino's trip to Washington is seen as a continuation of a mission, begun last week, when he visited Brussels in an attempt to reassure European Union colleagues. In Brussels, Mr Martino won praise from the British foreign secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, who called for early talks between UK prime minister John Major and Mr Berlusconi.</p>

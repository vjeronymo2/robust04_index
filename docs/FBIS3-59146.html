			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Hamburg (DDP/ADN) -- Germany's Economic Affairs  Minister Guenter Rexrodt today called for a multilateral GATT  agreement on air traffic in Hamburg. Only regulated and fair  competition can "prevent a new subsidy race," Rexrodt said  during the handover to Lufthansa of a new Airbus model.  Regarding recent complications involving the German-U.S. air  traffic agreement, Rexrodt stated forcefully that "the United  States also has to accept that its indirect support of air  traffic is now open to question. Equality of opportunity in the  skies has to apply worldwide."    Rexrodt backed the further expansion of air traffic in  Germany. It is "extremely damaging" for Germany "that it is not  possible to build a runway today without encountering  resistance." Germany has to develop its airports if it wants to  avoid being cut off from international traffic routes in the  future. At the international level, Rexrodt called for fair  "market entry opportunities" and a stop to "protectionism  disguised as environmental protection." [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Ireland moves on divorce vote THE Irish government yesterday published its much-awaited White Paper on divorce, which proposes a referendum to reverse the country's constitutional ban, writes Tim Coone in Dublin. A pro-divorce motion in a referendum in 1986 was defeated by 63.5 per cent to 36.5 per cent. The Catholic Church remains adamantly opposed to divorce and is likely again to campaign against the proposed change. No date has been set for the referendum. However, it is unlikely to be held before the end of 1993.</p>

			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Surveyors prefer caution YOUR HOUSE purchase is proceeding smoothly until the surveyor's valuation report lands at the building society where you have applied for a mortgage loan. The surveyor says that the agreed price of the property is 5 per cent too high. At once, you start to worry that you will not get the mortgage loan The nagging suspicion creeps in that you are being ripped off. The answer may not necessarily be yes. Surveyors have always erred on the side of caution in preparing valuation reports since they are acting for building societies or banks, advising whether the provision of the loan to buy the property is a reasonable commercial risk. In other words, they have to judge whether, in the event of a repossession the house could be sold at a reasonable price. Although the surveyor's client is the lender rather than the purchaser, they are in the invidious position of potentially being held responsible by both parties should a serious structural problem be missed. After two years of falling house prices across much of the country and a rise in the number of repossessions, surveyors are understandably showing even greater caution and a growing reluctance to accept market valuations, particularly in the south where prices have fallen most. As Peter Hutchins of Lawson and Daughters, a London estate agency, says: 'During 1987 and 1988, surveyors were very relaxed about valuing the property at the price agreed. But we are finding that they are more cautious nowadays, and recommending more and more retentions. This means they will suggest, for instance, that the price is only fair if a damp proof course is put in, and that some of the loan should be held back until satisfactory structural work is carried out by a given date.' This is probably enough to put all but the keenest purchasers off and to send shivers down the vendors' backs. 'The first step I'd take is to go up the road to another firm of estate agents and ask how much a property like the one I was buying was worth,' said Tony Copping Joyce of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS). 'If the price seems reasonable, and there are no other problems, go ahead.' If it seems high, you have to weigh how much you want the house and how keen you are to sell your present one quickly. If you try to renegotiate you may jeopardise the transaction. If a great deal of structural work is needed, such as dry rot treatment or underpinning the purchaser is in a strong position to renegotiate. But if all that is required is the replacement of a metre of guttering you probably will not get far. If you are considering carrying out building repairs after you have moved in, it is essential to get a full structural survey from a chartered surveyor who is a member of the RICS  - a good idea in any case. Although most surveyors will be unwilling to give an exact estimate of the likely cost of building work, they should be able to provide a guide. Unless there is serious structural work to be undertaken, the deciding factor is often the attitude of the lender. This will depend on the condition of the house and the estimated creditworthiness of the person applying for the mortgage loan. If you are not borrowing more than 70 per cent of the original agreed price, the lender may not worry if the valuation is 5 per cent less than the agreed price. But if you want to borrow 100 per cent, you will only be able to borrow 100 per cent of the valuation price instead. Building societies are not allowed to lend more than the valuation says the property is worth. If the building society agrees to lend you the amount on condition you carry out specified structural work, it will probably hold back a sum equivalent to their estimate of the cost of the work. This may also mean that the insurance company covering the mortgage loan will not grant full insurance on the property until the work is completed. Bear in mind, says Hutchins, that the surveyor is likely to think cautiously. If vendors are caught unprepared, all they can do is play it by ear.</p>

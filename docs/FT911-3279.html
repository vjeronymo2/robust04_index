			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Kurdish rebels claim autonomy agreement with Iraq AN IRAQI rebel leader said yesterday that President Saddam Hussein had agreed to grant a measure of autonomy to the Kurds, raising the prospect of a negotiated end to the disaster that has forced more than 2m Kurds to flee their homes in northern Iraq, write our foreign staff. Mr Jalal Talabani, leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, announced the deal 'in principle' after talks with the Iraqi president. Shortly before the announcement, Mr Abdul Amir Al-Anbari, Iraq's UN ambassador, said it was his 'impression' an autonomous state might result from the talks. Asked how far Baghdad was prepared to go towards Kurdish autonomy, he said: 'They seem to be going all the way.' Mr Talabani immediately appealed to thousands of refugee Kurdish families who fled towards Iran and Turkey after a failed uprising to return to their homes in northern Iraq. Reaction from Washington and London was cautious. Officials said they had no confirmation a deal had been signed. One US official said he hoped any deal 'would help facilitate the sense of security for people to return to their homes', but the US was 'sceptical' because Saddam had previously broken verbal promises. Mr Talabani said the deal covered implementation of a March 11 1970 autonomy agreement between the Kurds, who form 20 per cent of Iraq's population, and the central government, he added. Negotiations with the authorities in Baghdad would be resumed on Sunday to flesh out the agreement. It remains to be seen if Mr Saddam will accept Kurdish demands for a genuinely autonomous region within a democratic Iraq, for control of oil revenue from Kurdish areas and for international guarantees to bolster any agreement that is signed. Both sides however need a deal. Mr Saddam's army has been weakened by the Gulf war and he would not be able to use chemical weapons against the Kurds without angering the international community. The Kurdish guerrillas are still a force to be reckoned with in the mountains, but they face an uphill task if nearly 2m refugees - half the Kurds of Iraq - do not return to their homes.

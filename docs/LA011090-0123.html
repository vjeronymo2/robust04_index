			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> ERROR FREES SUSPECT IN GANG CASE  </P> <P> A Santa Ana man arrested on suspicion of intimidating witnesses to one of  Orange County's bloodiest gang-related shootings was mistakenly released from  jail less than 24 hours after his arrest, officials confirmed Tuesday.  </P> <P> "It's a mistake that should not have happened," Deputy Dist. Atty. Tom Avdeef  said. "(There is) obviously no reason to release a gang member that's just been  arrested for threatening witnesses."  </P> <P> Orange County Jail officials, however, said they were not at fault in releasing  Richard (Sleepy) Ramirez Friday on his own recognizance, contending that they  followed routine procedures.  </P> <P> A spokesman at the jail said that Ramirez, 21, was released because jail  officials believed the charges filed against him were misdemeanors. "He  received the same treatment as others who are cited for misdemeanors," said the  spokesman, who asked not to be identified.  </P> <P> But Avdeef said the two counts of criminal conspiracy and intimidation of  witnesses were felonies.  </P> <P> Authorities became aware of Ramirez's release on Tuesday, and as of late  Tuesday night he had not been re-arrested.  </P> <P> "This should not have happened," said Isabel Rodriguez, one of the witnesses.  "He has been a big problem for us."  </P> <P> Santa Ana police arrested Ramirez on Thursday after a judge issued arrest  warrants for him and two other reputed members of the 5th Street gang.  </P> <P> The three allegedly harassed witnesses to the Sept. 16 drive-by shooting on  Bonita Avenue that left a 4-year-old boy and a 17-year-old youth dead and six  people wounded. Police believe that members of the 5th Street gang fired the  shots.  </P> <P> Police records allege that gang members issued nightly death threats against  witnesses, tossed Molotov cocktails into their houses and attempted to run down  a 12-year-old as he played football in the street.  </P> <P> Three other reputed members of the 5th Street gang have been charged with  murder in the drive-by slayings.  </P> <P> On Tuesday night, sheriff's deputies and police sought to determine exactly how  Ramirez came to be freed on his own recognizance. Avdeef said that jail  officials said they released Ramirez because the officer who cited the Santa  Ana man had written "misdemeanor" on the booking slips.  </P> <P> "I told (Santa Ana police) that they better check and see who put down  'misdemeanor,' " Avdeef said. "The police said they didn't do it because they  were interested in keeping the guy in jail." DAVAN MAHARAJ  </P></p>

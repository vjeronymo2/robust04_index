Senior members of the House of Representatives Budget  Committee, comprising both ruling coalition and opposition  parties, held sessions on and off to set a schedule to  deliberate the 73.08 trillion yen national budget for fiscal  1994, which starts April 1. Deliberations were earlier expected  to start as early as Monday.    However, negotiations broke down after the main opposition  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the Japanese Communist Party  (JCP) stuck to their demands for the government to submit  detailed documents concerning 100 million yen Hosokawa borrowed  from leading trucking firm Sagawa Kyubin Co., officials said.  The dispute could force the panel to delay budget discussions  until late next week, they said.    The government on Friday submitted to the panel some  documents relating to the loan but the two parties were  dissatisfied, saying the documents were not sufficient to clear  their doubts on the matter, they said. The two parties renewed  their demands that the government offer further detailed  documents, the officials said.    Last December, Hosokawa said in a memo submitted to the Diet  that he borrowed the money from Sagawa Kyubin in September 1982  to buy a condominium in central Tokyo and repair his home in  Kumamoto Prefecture. The premier said he repaid the money by  January 31, 1991.    Sagawa is a leading parcel delivery firm which was involved  in a money-and-mobster scandal which implicated former Prime  Minister Noboru Takeshita and fallen LDP power broker Shin  Kanemaru.</p>

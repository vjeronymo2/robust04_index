			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yuriy Rytov report: "Food Prices. They Are Not Regulated </F> at Federal Level, But Regional Regulation Exists and Is  Producing Good Results"]    [Text] As is well known, the state now no longer sets  prices for any goods -- be they industrial or consumer goods.  (With the exception of energy prices.) But the regions are  entitled to regulate food prices.    And, in my view, this rule has been very successful -- and  entirely justified -- in many areas. Provided, needless to say,  that the bare formula of reform is not followed, but is given  some real content.    This April there was price regulation of foodstuffs in 104  cities (out of the 132 surveyed by the Russian Federation State  Committee for Statistics).    Needless to say, the level of influence exerted by the local  administration on price regulation varied from region to region.  Thus, in the cities of the Volga-Vyatka and North Caucasus  regions prices of all the most important foodstuffs were  regulated. In the Northern and Northwest regions this process  was restricted to a few cities -- Cherepovets, Pskov, and the  cities of the Komi Republic.    I would like to quote a few figures from the Russian  Federation State Committee for Statistics which show just what  foodstuffs were of particular concern to local administrations.    Milk prices were regulated in 69 percent of the cities  surveyed by the Russian Federation State Committee for  Statistics. Beef prices were regulated in 45 percent of cities,  and cooked sausage prices in 42 percent.    The question naturally arises -- just how do local  administrations manage to hold down price growth?    The most widespread form of price regulation (around 50  percent of all price regulation) is to limit the size of trading  organizations' markups. The profitability of food industry  enterprises is controlled in approximately 5 percent of cities.    Consequently, there are some sharp difference in food prices  in different regions. For instance, in mid-May the average cost  of a basket of 19 of the most important foodstuffs was 51,100  rubles [R] (over the month). The price of the same basket in  Moscow was more than R55,000. The basket is still cheapest in  Ulyanovsk -- at R30,000. It is slightly more in Chistopol  (R35,000) and Lipetsk (R36,000).</p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Establish new Ulster assembly, Major told The Ulster Unionist leader Mr James Molyneaux urged Mr John Major yesterday to drop his search for a comprehensive constitutional settlement for Northern Ireland in favour of a drive to establish a new Ulster assembly. Mr Molyneaux, who holds an effective veto over the prime minister's efforts, said the groundwork for all-party talks on devolved government could be completed within two weeks. Resumed talks should focus on the creation of the 85-seat legislative assembly - the model for which was drawn up in abortive talks last year. In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Molyneaux said there was 'a fair chance' that Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister, would be able 'within a week or two' to identify common ground between the province's political parties. That 'will enable us to start the process of restoring accountable democracy for Northern Ireland'. His comments came as Mr Major appeared to improve strained relations with the Rev Ian Paisley by telling the leader of the hard-line Democratic Unionist party that proposals for a political settlement leaked in Dublin last week were totally unacceptable. In spite of the latest setbacks, Downing Street signalled Mr Major's determination to press on with efforts to find a settlement by announcing that he had set up a group of senior ministers to oversee policy. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, also sought to reassure unionist politicians that fears about Dublin's intentions were groundless. But Mr Molyneaux said the Major-Reynolds initiative was doomed. Dublin would give up its constitutional claim to Northern Ireland only in return for 'something which has the same effect as the territorial claim'. Asked if they should break off negotiations, he responded: 'Well, it's futile, isn't it, because unless they could get agreement to something which was as significant and acceptable to the IRA as joint authority leading on to Irish unity, then it is not going to make any difference to the so-called peace process.' It made sense for the two leaders to meet regularly: 'But what I think they ought to be realistic about is the fact that the two governments cannot really influence the decisions of Mr Adams and his cohorts in the IRA.' Mr Molyneaux said the Dublin proposals offer 'a structure that would bring about the unification of the national territory'. The draft paper had 'all the designs and a good many of the paragraphs' of the initiative launched by Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Roman Catholic SDLP, and Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein. He described the Hume-Adams plan as a 'fiendishly clever operation' to secure Irish unification. Mr Major's search for a comprehensive agreement between London, Dublin and the Northern Ireland parties had 'lost a great deal of its validity', he said. The IRA could be defeated only by tougher security measures, Mr Molyneaux added. He backed the reintroduction of selective detention, or internment. Mr Molyneaux sets his terms, Page 8</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by S. G. Kozhevatkin, M. V. Artamonova, and V. I. </F> Molev, PO ``Lytkarinskiy Zavod Opticheskogo Stekla'';  UDC666.11.01]    [Abstract] Development of a new generation of apochromatic  objective lenses requires optical materials having special  properties. Optical glasses having a large variety of optical  constants and other parameters which make it possible to develop  optically perfect systems, play a leading role among such  materials. A pressing problem is the development of glasses  having both a special course of dispersion and low  thermo-optical constant (TOP). These are called adiathermal  glasses. The joining of special course of dispersion with low  TOP makes it possible to develop systems which are  non-misaligning under apochromatic-anastigmatic temperature  gradient conditions with corrected secondary spectrum. With such  systems the number of lenses in complex objective lens systems  is determined by the special properties of the glasses and may  be minimized. The majority of industrial glasses produced here  and abroad do not simultaneously have adiathermal properties and  special courses of dispersion. In the present work a series of  adiathermal optical glasses with special courses of dispersion  were developed. Data was also obtained which may be used in the  synthesis of special purpose adiathermal glasses. Adiathermal  phosphate glasses with special course of dispersion and fitting  in various areas of the Abbe diagram were developed which have a  number of advantages over similar industrial glasses.  Calculations show that objective lenses consisting of the newly  developed glasses are not inferior to industrial glasses in  longitudinal chromatic aberration (secondary spectrum) and have  less thermo-optical and thermo-wave aberration.

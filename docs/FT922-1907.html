			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Perot factor unnerves the Mexican market: US commitment to Nafta dents expectations of an imminent economic miracle ROSS Perot as US president may still be unlikely, but the prospect of a close US presidential race this autumn is causing increasing anxiety among Mexican officials and, more significantly, investors in the country's volatile stockmarket. The Mexican stock market fell 12 per cent in the first three days of the week, partly recovering by yesterday. The plunge was in part because of Mr Perot's (admittedly inconsistent) declarations against the proposed North American free trade agreement. The fear is not just that he might win, but that his popularity might force Bill Clinton, the Democratic candidate, and wavering congressmen to be much more circumspect in their support for the agreement. Although Mexico's economy is in its best shape for at least 20 years, the country remains acutely dependent on events in the US. Some 70 per cent of Mexico's trade is with its northern neighbour, and if US growth were to remain sluggish, Mexico's exports would suffer. More important, Mexico is likely to run a current account deficit of more than Dollars 16bn this year, and depends on mainly US capital inflows to plug the gap. If the political uncertainty engendered by the Perot candidacy affects the US economy, Mexico thus suffers too. Add to that the fear that Nafta will not be passed, and the recent gloom in Mexico becomes understandable. Nafta matters, says one investment banker visiting Mexico, because it will encourage fund managers to treat Mexico as part of North, rather than Latin, America. Mexican risk will fall appreciably, and Mexican companies will thus be valued more like US than say Brazilian ones. For a country which culturally and politically is much closer to most Latin American nations than the US, that is quite a feat. Mr Jorge Mariscal, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, put the case for the agreement succinctly: 'For investors considering Mexico, it (Nafta) means an historical shift in Mexican attitudes towards its northern partners and therefore a drastic reduction in the perception of risk. Under Nafta, Mexico would find it very difficult to revert to the protectionist, interventionist economic models (of) the 70s and 80s'. If the agreement is in doubt, the reverse logic can be applied. The Mexican government is probably kicking itself for not starting the free trade talks (in earnest) until September last year. Like almost everyone else, they overestimated the popularity of US President George Bush, and believed that his commitment to a free trade agreement was enough. Now they will have to sit through the next six months, quietly cheering on George Bush, while making discreet overtures to Bill Clinton. The government has argued that the underlying economy is in good shape. Mexico's total debt to GDP ratio is 29 per cent, against 74 per cent when President Carlos Salinas came to power, suggesting that Mexico has put the debt crisis behind it. Inflation is falling and is likely to be around 12 per cent this year, while the budget is in surplus. With or without Nafta, the foundations for stable economic growth appear to have been built. The trouble is that Nafta has raised expectations of an imminent 'Mexican miracle'. This year alone Mexican companies have issued an estimated Dollars 4bn in equity, in an attempt to raise capital in anticipation of integration with the US. Banacci, the financial group comprising Mexico's largest bank, was planning to issue Dollars 1.5bn of new equity next week, although the recent falls in the stock market mean it may have to offer fewer shares, at a discount. Many banks and companies in line to issue stock after Banacci may now postpone.</p>

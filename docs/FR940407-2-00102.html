As in the original reclamation plan, the proposed plan calls for reclamation of the tailings impoundment in place, covering the tailings with a soil cover to reduce radon emanation, and flattening the embankment side slopes to 10 horizontal to 3 vertical (10H:3V) or less. In addition, the license amendment application proposes the following modifications of the previous plan: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. As means of promoting surface water drainage, the original domed top configuration would be changed to a system of channels. Three collection ditches would merge to form a larger drainage channel which would convey flood runoff from the reclaimed tailings surface into Moab Wash. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The soil cover thickness for radon attenuation purposes would be reduced based on an increase in the allowable radon emanation rate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The erosion protection cover design would be modified. The top of the tailings impoundment would be covered with a layer of compacted rock and soil, and the embankment side slopes would be covered with rock native to the region. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Moab Wash would be reconfigured and designed to contain the Probable Maximum Flood, and convey flood flows into the Colorado River east of the tailings pile. On the southwest side of the tailings embankment, another drainage channel would divert runoff from the natural sandstone bluffs southwest of the channel. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The licensee's proposal, currently under review, was first proposed to the NRC by a letter dated August 2, 1988, and has been modified by submittals dated January 17, 1989, June 4, 1992, April 14, 1993, and April 23, 1993. Additional information has been requested from the licensee by NRC letters dated October 8, 1993, November 29, 1993, and January 3, 1994. Responses to these letters may result in futher modifications to the reclamation plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For Further Information Contact: Allan T.

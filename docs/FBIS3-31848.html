In 1994, the restructuring of  lower echelons will be finalized: Army corps, brigades, and  independent battalions. Thus, it is believed that in this way  the mobility and effectiveness of troops will improve.    The government strategy program of the PDSR [Social  Democracy  Party of Romania] has set up the coordinating instrument for the  activity of the Ministry of National Defense. Given the efforts  to stabilize the economy and the difficulties characteristic of  Romania's transition to the market economy, the Army has made  indubitable progress. The Army's noninvolvement in politics and  its increased credibility form the starting point for training  our troops even under difficult financial conditions -- three  times fewer funds than in 1989.    One of the Army's successes was maintaining the national  defense industry intact (Defense Minister Niculae Spiroiu  recently said that "not even a single drill press was given  away") and ensuring 74 percent of the combat equipment from our  own supplies. Aside from this, all export orders have been  finalized and, given the fact that the military conversion  process has begun, we have started manufacturing products  designed for civilian purposes. The Army has not imported  anything that can be manufactured in our country, except for top  technologies to be used in the defense industry. As a result of  this technological adjustment, high performance systems on the  basis of licenses from the NATO member countries or Israel have  been manufactured in our country.    In the area of electronics, Israel benefits from valuable  U.S., French, or own technologies not to be matched by similar  Soviet technologies (speed, precision, pattern, consumption, and  so forth). Let us recall that during the Arab-Israeli war the  big tank battle in the Sinai (1973) was won by Israel with a lot  of leeway. General Ariel Sharon's victory in the second biggest  tank battle of all time was not a battle of more powerful and  bigger tanks, but a battle of more "intelligent" tanks with  better night "vision" and more precise computer-guided weapons.  The same thing was reconfirmed during the Gulf war.    Other highly technological products manufactured in Romania  in cooperation with Israeli experts are the components of the  aeronautical industry (navigation, targeting, and fire-contol  systems). It is known that the training of pilots in Israel (a  country with limited resources like we ourselves) and technology  have tripled their combat capacity and the number of sorties of  each plane and pilot. This is how they ensured their supremacy  in the air, although they had half as many planes as the Arabs.  The most interesting argument, however, is the fact that all  NATO members (including the U.S., France, Germany, and Great  Britain) are sending their elite pilots and engineers to attend  courses in Israel to perfect their knowledge.    The contracting of Romania's exercise planes IAR-99 and  IAR-108 by Israel and the United States will be all the more  successful. Anyhow, these planes are being tested in the two  countries.    On the other hand, instead of procuring expensive, modern  planes like the MiG-21, using Israeli electronic devices would  mean important savings.    In the area of reducing combat equipment under international  supervision, the Ministry of National Defense was able in 1993  to abide by what was established during negotiations and thus  able to scrap 25 percent of the planned equipment (especially  used and outdated ones). In 1994, scrapping will be increased  to 35 percent, and what is left for 1995 is 40 percent.    In the area of cutting back troops, their number will amount  to 268,000 (on 1 January 1994) and 230,000 (in 1995). They will  be, first and foremost, fighters, not people from auxiliary  branches, because the "Army can no longer be jack of all trades  and do everything" (as Lieutenant General N. Spiroiu put it).    Given the East European conflicts, the only area of balance  and security is the one under NATO's umbrella. Romania's  tendency to avoid dangerous imbalances and to get closer to NATO  is justified and necessary because NATO remains the only  political-military body able to offer guarantees for territorial  integrity and the continuation of our democratic process.    A gradual getting closer to and integration in the North  Atlantic structures are possible on the basis of compatible and  complementary military standards and doctrines based on the  following principles: 1. The inviolability of national and  European security; 2. The defensive nature of forces and  limiting them solely to the national territory; 3. The  preparation of the territory and of the economy for defense; 4.  The national exclusiveness of ordering Romanian military  components.    Certainly, NATO integration involves high costs.  Restructuring the Army and the national defense industry will  entail important financial efforts throughout several years. We  have to bear in mind, however, that beginning in 1968 Romania  detached itself from the sole Eastern supplier in this respect  and began the construction of its own defense industry on the  basis of Western standards: Aviation (on the basis of French and  British licenses), artillery (partly on the basis of NATO  standards), air-to-ground and antitank missiles (French  licenses), and so forth. The main Romanian accomplishments in  this respect are based on Western type of components and  technologies.    Even in the area of telecommunications, everything,  beginning  with small- and medium-size portable equipment (which is needed  by the troops), has been manufactured in our country with  transistors, integrated circuits, connections, and computers on  the basis of such licenses as Souriou, IBM, Control Data, and so  forth.    This is why Romania only has to preserve its specialized  labor force and to modernize its production capacities by  introducing new technologies. This is precisely what is  happening now. True, there are dysfunctions, but they are kept  under control. Thus, the Army is able to do its duty at all  times.</p>

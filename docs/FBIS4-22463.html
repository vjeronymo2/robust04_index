			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the </F> Federation Council of the Federal Assembly of the Russian  Federation, by unidentified ARGUMENTY I FAKTY correspondent(s);  place and date not given: "V. Shumeyko: When We Have Stability,  Wealth Will Follow"]    [Text] [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Vladimir Filippovich, we hear  that political chaos is reigning in the country; that we cannot  live like this anymore. Is it so difficult to find the way to an  accord?    [Shumeyko] Yes, political chaos does indeed exist. Russia is  currently going through a peak in politician activism while  voter activism has hit the bottom. Voter activism has dropped in  both the democratic camp and among the opposition. For instance,  in St. Petersburg there were 750 candidates for 50 seats in the  Duma. At that point Sobchak permitted a rally to be held against  these elections at the request of four parties of communist  orientation. They wanted to bring out 15,000 people at the  Palace Square. At the designated time, 22 persons showed up. It  became clear that people are tired of this all. Politicians have  completely lost touch with real life.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] You have lived through two putsches: one  inside the "White House" and one outside it. What do you think?  Will you survive the third?    [Shumeyko] I think there will not be a third one. There are  no preconditions for it today.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] On 4 April it is six months since the  tragic October events. Was it possible to avoid them?    [Shumeyko] At the negotiations the evening of Friday, 1  October, the White House defenders set a condition: to hold  early presidential elections on 12 December. When the president  was told about this condition, he said that for the sake of  national accord he would be willing to run for reelection any  time.    Those in the White House learned about it, and the  opposition's main trump card was rendered void. This is when the  events began to escalate instantly. A demonstration moved from  October Square to the White House and began storming the Comecon  building. A convoy took off for Ostankino at the same time.    We spent the whole night deciding what to do. We could not  let events spill out further from Moscow across Russia. A civil  war in an industrially developed state, where any power station,  chemical enterprise, or defense plant may be blown up is  suicide. As if we did not have enough with Chernobyl.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] But violence eventually had to be  stopped  by even greater violence--tanks.    [Shumeyko] Our plan was predicated on the assumption that  Rutskoy is a military man, not a politician. If, in the morning,  a professional military man sees tanks with guns trained on him,  he understands perfectly well that they will fire. It is time to  surrender. But Rutskoy hoped that there would be those who would  defend him. The people, however, were not jumping under these  tanks, and did not rise to defend Rutskoy and Khasbulatov. And  when the besieged were told "Come out with a white flag,"  machine-gun fire came from a White House window. The first shell  from a tank went to the window from which machine-gun fire was  coming. After that there was again a pause, designed for the  reaction of a military man who is given time to change his mind.  Because if it is war, the shelling will continue until victory.    To tell the truth, nobody expected the besieged to start  military action. The army did not want to start this war. I get  indignant when people say that Yerin showed himself as a weak  man and the troops did not shoot. Do you think it is easy to  make a soldier shoot at his own people?    Now I think: Rutskoy is a professional, you cannot take that  away from him, but he was not in control of the situation in  there. I am certain of it. Because if parliament defends the  constitution, but at the same time allows fascists to defend  itself (remember Barkashov people with swastikas on their  sleeves), what kind of law, what constitution, what parliament  are we talking about? The constitution says that even fascist  propaganda is impermissible.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] But, on the other hand, the constitution  does not say that you can fire at the elected parliament.    [Shumeyko] I agree with you unequivocally. But neither does  the constitution say that you can allow a civil war to happen.  What I will say may sound cynical: An aircraft went down; 75  people died. We have lived through this tragedy--what can we do  about it? There were 120 people who died around the White House.  Yes, I am sorry for them. But Russia was saved at this price,  since civil peace was restored. Everything we did, we did right.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] And you think that the memory of those  October days subconsciously prompts all political forces to  accord?    [Shumeyko] Accord is inherent in today's life. Nobody wants  any more of these battles. Ordinary people understand better  than politicians that Russia can be turned only once in a  century, Russia, like a huge ship, has just turned toward  reforms. And now what; turn back?    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Can an accord be reached at the time of  intensive fight for power?    [Shumeyko] It is easier to seize power when everything is  collapsing. To gain it in a democratic way--through  elections--naturally, is difficult. But more honorable. Then let  us first strengthen this authority. The institution of the  presidency is the youngest in the state. There has always been a  czar. After the czar, general secretary--the same czar. For the  first time democratic presidential authority was born in Russia.  When it gets stronger, then let us go for it in a democratic  way. But there are many who do not want to strengthen it!    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Since you have become a Russian deputy,  you also have been near the helm of power all the time. It was  probably not easy to be Khasbulatov's deputy, was it?    [Shumeyko] After I was made his deputy, our relations became  difficult right away. Before the Sixth Congress he told me that  we will need to speak up and defeat Gaydar's government. I told  him that I have a different opinion: Gaydar's government does  what is necessary and possible only in this today's situation.  Shock therapy is beyond the point. We do not have it; nobody has  launched any shock therapy. It would not occur to any of us with  our socialist-economic thinking to suddenly free prices. And  Gaydar was right in proposing to free prices for everything at  the same time. But, we did not agree... The main achievement of  our reforms is that the market got 76 percent saturated at  prices that are higher than world prices. Now we can develop our  own producer. At the time, though, the country was on the brink  of complete collapse and ruin... Now some people say that Gaydar  is at fault, that Yeltsin is at fault, that they have destroyed  the entire economy and the state. They saved it. It was the CPSU  that had been destroying it.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] And what about the money that is flowing  abroad--the money for natural resources, the people's wealth?    [Shumeyko] And why do foreign investors not invest money in  the Russian economy? They will not invest a kopek as long as  they see that our own people open accounts abroad! And they do  it because they have no idea how things will develop here. They  allow for the possibility that the day may come when their money  will be taken away and everything will return to the way it was.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Why can the government not earn credit  for such confidence that our people would keep their money here  and foreign investors would not mind investing in the Russian  economy?    [Shumeyko] You cannot change people overnight. The West  looks  at us the same way: Today one thing is happening, tomorrow--a  different one, and the day after tomorrow--different again. When  it stabilizes we will invest the money; no stability--even the  rich compatriots will leave, together with families, and will  live abroad. People are people; they simply do not believe.  Since there is no accord in the country, there is no peace, no  stabilization; so why should one keep his money here?    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Your charm gets you out of any  adversity.  But even in your life there have been situations when everything  was against you. You are so smart--how could you get into a jam?    [Shumeyko] I have certainly been through some. Especially  with the Procuracy. I asked then to relieve me temporarily of my  job so I could sort it out. I have never had a harder time in my  life. When they brought a document to me and asked: "Is this  your signature?" I said: "Mine."--"It is not a forgery?"--"No,  it is my signature. But I have never put my signature on this  text." The saddest part is that there is a number of documents  against, for instance, Rutskoy, or myself, which has been made  in the same place, at the order of the same people. This is the  most depressing part. Because Rutskoy by himself had never been  the person he became. We shape ourselves, and others,  too--depending on how easy they are to shape. And history shapes  us all.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] You are again in the presidium, and now  before you is not a congress, not the former parliament, but  essentially a small group of people--the Federation Council. Can  accord be reached with them?    [Shumeyko] Today it is the president who offers accord. And  if the chief politician believes that Russia is ready for this  accord, it is already indicative. He could not offer such a  thing earlier. In the Federation Council we have politicians of  high rank. Sixty-seven percent of them are people who have real  authority. This accord is addressed to them today. Even the  communist "branch" offered its text of accord for the sake of  Russia. The president understands that there cannot be two or  three accords. There can only be one. Either it is there or it  is not. When Chernomyrdin came for the first time to the  Federation Council, he said that the Japanese, when they were  pulling out of economic backwardness, worked without a single  day off, 12 hours a day. And the entire Federation Council  applauded. It was seen that a watershed has been reached:  Everybody understood that it was time, that we had to get to  work.    This is precisely that element of accord that showed in the  emotions. This mood gave away all politicians: We are tired of  it; let us find accord and begin working.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Former U.S. President Nixon says that  Zhirinovskiy, with his demagoguery and rudeness, will never  become president of Russia. Chubays says that Zhirinovskiy  intends to become president by this fall. In your opinion, does  he have a chance?    [Shumeyko] Zhirinovskiy's style is not clownery--it is the  theory of populism. Its meaning is that a person must proclaim  himself in as shocking a way as possible, such as in a play  staged by a talented director. People forget in a week what he  said, but remember who said it. Try to recall everything and  repeat it. You will not be able to. Both Gaydar and Chubays say  that Zhirinovskiy brought fascism. In reality, Zhirinovskiy is a  populist, not a fascist. The people who participated in  elections were mostly pensioners. They could not vote for  fascists. We do not have any families that have not suffered  during the war.    We are a great nation, and Russia, beginning with Ivan  Kalita, always developed by expansion. Along the way of  development, by absorbing peoples, confessions, cultures, it  became an empire. Communists came and made use of this imperial  theory. One-sixth of dry land--"the great, powerful Soviet  Union." We were proud of it. We were all called Russians in the  West, whether we were Tatars or Jews. And suddenly for the first  time in its entire 1000-year history Russia has lost part of its  territory. Russian people who found themselves outside of it  became "Russian-speaking," a "national minority," or whatever  else!    The nation has experienced a psychological shock. And  Zhirinovskiy very skillfully used it.    [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] You have spoken actively on the subject  of a Eurasian Union. Is this a realization of a past mistake? In  your opinion, is a union possible?    [Shumeyko] It is possible, but not today. We began speaking  of it in order to "test" this idea in the society. Life forces  us to do it. There are many Russian-speaking people left outside  of Russia. We propose to CIS countries to introduce dual  citizenship. But if we can count on it, why do we need to erect  borders between us and impose customs duties?    We need a more rigid organization of what you call the  Commonwealth. Why not step straight up to world level and create  out of the CIS a Eurasian Union, a civilized union of countries  aimed at meeting each others' interests?!</p>

			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COMFORT LEVEL TO STAY HIGH FOR WEEKEND  </P> <P> It sounds slightly suspicious, a little illegal, but definitely wonderful. San  Diego will be under the influence of an upper-level trough of low pressure  through the weekend, the National Weather Service said Thursday.  </P> <P> Loosely translated, this means San Diego is in for more comfortable summertime  weather, with temperatures slightly below seasonal, said forecaster Harvey  Hastrup. Throw in some sunny skies and ocean sea breezes to complete the  picture.  </P> <P> "The same weather pattern we've been experiencing for the past week is expected  to continue through this weekend," Hastrup said. "We may feel a very slow  warming trend beginning Sunday. However, the temperatures will still remain  below normal for this time of year."  </P> <P> At the beaches, there will be night and morning low clouds, becoming mostly  sunny in the afternoons, Hastrup said. Highs today and Saturday will be from 69  to 72 degrees, nudging up a couple of degrees on Sunday.  </P> <P> The surf is 2 to 3 feet. Sea breezes are 10 to 18 m.p.h. The ocean water is  near 60 degrees.  </P> <P> The coastal strip also will experience some night and morning low clouds, but  days will be sunny with highs in the mid-70s, Hastrup said. Overnight lows will  be from 63 to 68 degrees.  </P> <P> Highs inland will be from 78 to 84 today and Saturday, rising a couple of  degrees on Sunday, Hastrup said. Lows will range from 54 to 62.  </P> <P> Fair conditions will prevail in the mountains through the weekend, with the  exception of some low clouds and fog on lower coastal mountain slopes, Hastrup  said. Occasional winds will gust up to 25 m.p.h. in the afternoon and evening.  </P> <P> Mountain highs will range from 70 to 78, and overnight lows will be between 48  and 56.  </P> <P> Highs in the desert will reach the mid-90s to low 100s today and Saturday. Lows  will be from 67 to 75.  </P></p>

			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Thorntons confirms recovery with Pounds 12.1m Thorntons, the chocolate maker and retailer, yesterday reported record annual profits and sales for the year to June 25, confirming its return to the black at the interim stage. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 12.1m against a loss of Pounds 4.8m, when there was a one-off provision of Pounds 7.63m to restructure the group's operation in France, as well as a Pounds 5.41m charge for goodwill previously written off to reserves. Operating profits on continuing operations were 20 per cent ahead at Pounds 12.6m. Turnover grew to Pounds 96.6m, including Pounds 3.48m from discontinued operations in France, against Pounds 92.5m, including Pounds 5.93m from discontinued operations. Like-for-like sales in France eased from Pounds 4.65m to Pounds 4.4m against a weak economic background. Commercial sales, mainly to Marks and Spencer and Boots, were 13 per cent ahead at Pounds 15m, while sales from the group's retail and franchise outlets were up by just over 7 per cent. Mr John Thornton, chairman and chief executive, said the results reflected the benefits of changes made in the UK and France. The group would this year concentrate on starting to iron out seasonal variations in its sales patterns by attracting more daily trade. At the moment the group has only 1 per cent of the daily confectionery trade, but 6 per cent of the gift market. About 30 per cent of sales are made in the Christmas period, with another surge at Easter. The French operation, now concentrated on 20 shops in Paris, halved its losses from Pounds 630,000 to Pounds 301,000. Mr Thornton said it was breaking even in cash terms in spite of the disruption of reorganisation, but he would not commit himself to predicting a profit this year. The group ended the year with net cash of Pounds 1.12m compared with previous net borrowings of Pounds 8.08m. Net interest payable fell from Pounds 978,000 to Pounds 469,000. Earnings per share were 12.19p (11.94p losses). A final dividend of 3.45p (2.4p) is recommended taking the total to 4.9p (3.65p). COMMENT Strong cash generation and a 34 per cent rise in the dividend highlight the strength of Thorntons' recovery. The group is moving in the right direction by trying to expand day-to-day sales of confectionery, but overall it remains a seasonal business driven by the sale of gifts. Given no further problems in France, and good sales at Christmas, profits can be expected to top Pounds 13.5m this year. This, with the shares up 5p at 183p yesterday, puts the group on a prospective multiple of 13, which is beginning to look attractive.</p>

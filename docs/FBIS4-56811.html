			<p>BFN     [Text] The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN)  has been trying to fill National Civilian Police (PNC) positions  with undeclared members of the former guerrillas, according to  the retiring deputy police commissioner. "The FMLN would  thereby maintain its rear guard in the organization," said Major  Oscar Armando Pena Duran, who explained that his appointment to  the PNC was negotiated with the FMLN. "My incorporation was  negotiated with the FMLN in exchange for some tests for  mid-level commanders at the Public Security Academy... so that  their mid-level commanders could join the PNC. It was decided  during the peace agreements," Pena Duran said.    The officer, who is retiring from the Army, explained that  the FMLN plans failed with regard to incorporation in the Drug  Trafficking Executive Unit (Unidad Ejecutiva Antinarcotrafico)  and the Commission to Investigate Criminal Actions of the PNC.  Pena Duran denied that his resignation was a result of pressure  and said that he decided to resign because he is suffering from  an ulcer, for which the doctor recommended a period of absolute  rest.    The first to celebrate Pena's resignation, however, was FMLN  Coordinator Jorge Shafik Handal. PNC Director Jose Maria  Monterrey announced that Jaime Vigil will be appointed acting  deputy police commissioner. Pena Duran worked as deputy  director of operations in charge of the following divisions:  public security, criminal investigations, narcotics, weapons,  explosives, environment, finance, traffic, and borders.  <H5>  Monterrey's Resignation </H5>   Meanwhile, PNC Director Monterrey said he would tender his  resignation when the new government is sworn in so that  President-elect Armando Calderon Sol can decide who will be in  charge of the police organization. It was also reported that  Mr. Monterrey has expressed his intention to return to private  business and that the new government's advisory team is looking  for someone to replace him.</p>

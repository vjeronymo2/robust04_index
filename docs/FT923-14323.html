			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Israeli chorus for privatisation sets Labour's agenda: Hugh Carnegy reports on a stunted programme that could provide much-needed funds but divide the new government AT FIRST sight it looks like a case of the cat being asked to hand over the cream: Israel's Labour party, in the past a diligent builder of socialist structures, is facing a near unanimous chorus of advice to speed up privatisation when it takes over the government next week. Far from mewling in protest, these days Labour leaders wrinkle their noses at the notion of state control of industry. In fact, they queue up to voice the merits of selling-off the great chunks of Israel's productive capacity that have accumulated in government hands. 'In principle we have to review everything,' says Mr Avraham Shochat, a senior Labour member of parliament and candidate for the post of finance minister. Privatisation has become accepted in Israel as an essential element in generating sufficient growth and funds to cope with mass immigration from the former Soviet Union. A report on Israel, published this month by the Economic Intelligence Unit (EIU), says that the government could raise between Dollars 7bn (Pounds 3.6bn) and Dollars 10bn from asset sales over the next four years. That would represent a significant part of the Dollars 50bn the Bank of Israel estimates is required to attract and absorb a target of 1m Jews from former Soviet territories within five years. But though the outgoing administration was controlled by the avowedly free-market Likud party, privatisation steps have been painfully slow since First Boston of New York produced a plan in 1988 for privatising 24 companies within four years. Partial stakes in key companies, such as Israel Chemicals and Bezeq, the telecommunications monopoly, have been successfully floated on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. Some small companies, such as Maman, an airport cargo handling outfit, have been sold. But government control over almost all of the biggest state companies remains intact. Labour will also have to tackle the country's big four banks, which control the vast majority of the local banking system and are big industrial owners. Since a Dollars 7bn government bail-out in 1983, following a share price collapse, a majority of the shares in Bank Hapoalim, Bank Leumi, Israel Discount Bank (IDB) and Bank Mizrahi have been held by the state, although without management control. Bidding is under way for Bank Mizrahi and Bank Igud, a unit of Bank Leumi. Minority portions of Bank Hapoalim, Bank Leumi and IDB are projected for a stock exchange flotation. But legislation placing the banks under state control if they are not sold off by next year will need to be amended if nationalisation of the others is to be avoided. The government's tendency to use the banks as instruments of policy, and a long record of bad debts, has raised questions over whether foreign investors will be willing to come into the market. To date, no foreign banks operate in Israel, bar a partnership that Barclays of the UK holds in an offshoot of IDB. Without foreign investors, potential local buyers - such as the Histadrut trade union federation, which would like to repurchase its pre-1983 ownership of Bank Hapoalim - will find it hard to raise the necessary funds. Mr Pinhas Landau, author of the EIU report, believes that any structural or ideological impediments to the process of privatisation will soon be swept aside by a more pressing concern: the fiscal pressures on the new government imposed by immigration. 'The government,' he says, 'will have to have the money and that's what will drive them.' Labour certainly sees privatisation as a vital source of funds for much-needed infrastructural investment in the economy. But some advocates of market reforms in Israel continue to doubt Labour's commitment to getting the government out of decision-making in industry and business. Mr Shochat himself said there were three categories of company in which Labour envisaged the government continuing to retain a controlling 26 per cent shareholding. He described these as 'natural monopolies', companies of strategic importance to the country, and those which play a vital security role. These encompass Bezeq and the Electric Corporation in the first category, Israel Chemicals in the second and Israel Aircraft Industries in the third. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Labour leader, has added El Al to the list. As one of its last acts, the outgoing government at the weekend ruled that Zim, the merchant shipping company, should also remain under government control. 'I think Rabin honestly wants to see privatisation pursued,' says Mr Daniel Doron, head of the Israel Centre for Social and Economic Progress. 'But he will face formidable interest groups in his party who will interpret privatisation in a peculiar way. I don't think many of them realise what private ownership means, what a regime of competition is and why it is important to the economy.'</p>

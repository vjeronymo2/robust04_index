			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Georgians recapture rebel capital GEORGIAN troops yesterday moved into Sukhumi, capital of the breakaway Abkhazian region, and quickly seized control of government and communication centres as thousands of residents and holidaymakers fled the city. Five people were killed when Abkhazian irregular forces resisted the move, according to the independent Interfax news agency, although Georgian ministers reported their forces had met no resistance. Itar-Tass news agency reported that Mr Vladislav Ardzinba, Abkhazia's parliamentary leader, had resigned. Georgian leaders had demanded his resignation on Monday under threat of armed intervention. Abkhazia's parliament effectively declared its independence from Georgia last month but its claims were dismissed by the country's leaders. Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, Georgia's acting head of government, has stressed repeatedly that Abkhazia would remain an integral part of the Georgian state. Russian press commentators yesterday voiced concern that the instability in Georgia could spark a more widespread conflagration in the Caucasus, an area plagued by four years of conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The Chechen region of southern Russia, which has supported Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia, the deposed Georgian leader, yesterday put its forces on full alert to deter possible Georgian military moves. Krasnaya Zvezda, the military newspaper, expressed outrage at the deaths of at least three Russian holidaymakers in the Abkhazian conflict. The Russian Defence Ministry said its paratroopers were guarding the airport and military facilities in Sukhumi. Lithuania's prime minister, Mr Aleksandras Abisala, said yesterday that the former Soviet Baltic states might reach agreement with Russia within two months on a timetable for the withdrawal of troops from their territories, Reuter reports. 'I think negotiations. . . . will now start seriously. Before, it was only political show,' he said after a three-day meeting of Nordic and Baltic premiers on the Danish island of Bornholm.</p>

			<p>940411 FT  11 APR 94 / Algeria devalues in deal with IMF The Algerian government, struggling with a collapsing economy and hostility from Moslem fundamentalists, is to devalue its currency by 40 per cent and raise interest rates as part of a programme worked out with the International Monetary Fund, AP-DJ reports from Algiers. Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, said on Algerian television the programme - which includes a timetable of measures to open up the Algerian economy - would allow Algeria to draw Dollars 1bn immediately from the IMF under a one-year stand-by agreement. He described the programme as 'sound and courageous' and said the IMF stood ready to work out a longer-term, three-year adjustment plan. The Algerian dinar, which is not convertible outside the country, had already been devalued by 7 per cent against a basket of foreign currencies a week ago. The new official exchange rate of the dinar is 36 to the dollar and about six to the French franc. On the black market recently, the franc changed hands at up to 16 dinars. The IMF deal is expected to free loans from other lending agencies, including Dollars 175m from the World Bank and Dollars 180m from the European Union. Japan is also understood to be considering a Dollars 150m loan. The stand-by agreement will clear the way for Algeria to start negotiations with creditor governments and banks on rescheduling part of its Dollars 26bn external debt. Previous Algerian governments had refused to consider a rescheduling accord, arguing that it would turn off the flow of commercial bank lending that the country so badly needs to finance its hydrocarbons industry. The programme also calls for a steep rise in interest rates set by the Bank of Algeria.</p>

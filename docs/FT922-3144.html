			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Car chiefs seek more DTI help CAR industry leaders, increas-ingly concerned at the absence of any clear revival in the UK's long-depressed market for new cars, are to seek further government support next Tuesday at their first meeting with Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. They are also expected to air their irritation over confusion created by conflicting UK and EC reports on price differentials on new cars within Europe. They will also use the meeting to oppose proposals in the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on car prices that the government should promote competition by lifting the 'voluntary restraints' that have restricted Japanese-built cars to 11 per cent of the UK market since the mid 1970s. The industry group will comprise the chief executives of Ford, Vauxhall, Rover and Peugeot, and Mr Colin Hope, president of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. They will meet Mr Heseltine against the background of statistics showing that a 9.1 per cent sales upturn in April was not sustained. Last month's sales were up only 1.4 per cent on a year-on-year basis, leaving the year-to-date total 5.3 per cent lower than the equivalent, severely depressed 1991 period. The gloom was underlined by statistics released yesterday which show that output fell last month by 6 per cent - the second successive monthly fall - under the impact of a steep decline in output for export markets. Mr Ian McAllister, Ford of Britain chairman, said that the expected post-election sales upturn 'patently has not materialised'. He warned that unless there was a marked recovery in August - the month of the new registration prefix which normally accounts for more than 20 per cent of annual sales - this year's market could be as small as 1.5m, some 35 per cent below the 1989 record of 2.3m. The industry delegation is likely to press Mr Heseltine to complete the abolition of special car tax - it was cut to 5 per cent from 10 per cent in the Budget - and take a more sympathetic view of company cars in his taxation review. Statistics from the society and the Central Office of Information showed car output dropping last month to 105,332 from 111,996 in May last year. Production for the domestic market rose by 16 per cent to 65,432, but this was overshadowed by a 28.3 per cent fall in output for export. Car production in the first five months, at 557,552, was 2.1 per cent lower than a year before. Commercial-vehicle output is maintaining the pace of recovery established in the past six months, however, helped by new ranges of small vans from Ford and Vauxhall. Commercial-vehicle production last month increased year-on-year by 30.3 per cent to 22,101. It was boosted by higher output for the domestic and export markets. Output of commercial vehicles in the first five months, at 111,486, was 19.8 per cent higher than in the corresponding period a year before. In spite of this improvement output was still nearly 26 per cent below the level of the first five months of 1989.</p>

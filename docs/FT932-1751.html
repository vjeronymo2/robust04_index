			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE 100 Index closes above 2,900 THE UK equity market yesterday regained the Footsie 2,900 territory last seen more than three months ago, helped by strength in dollar earning stocks and a good lead from stock index futures. Base rate hopes remained high following interest rate cuts in Europe and optimism appeared undimmed by unfavourable money supply figures from Germany. The closing reading on the FT-SE 100 Index of 2,903.4, the best of the day and a net gain of 24 points, was the highest since March 16. The driving force came from the futures market, where the September contract on the Footsie, in its first effective day's trading as market leader, climbed to a premium of 30 points to the underlying cash market. This sparked successive bursts of basket trading as leading securities houses played between cash and futures - selling futures contracts and buying the blue chip equities. With a strong US dollar also encouraging buyers across much of the Footsie range, the index soon reversed an early loss and broke through the 2,900 barrier at mid-morning. Equities were also helped by strength in long-dated government bonds. The market's progress on the first day of the new trading account was by no means unbroken, however, and it took a fresh spur from stock index futures to push the Footsie to the best level. The stress on basket trading left the second line issues relatively neglected, although the FT-SE Mid 250 Index edged up by 2.7 points to a new peak of 3,218.5. Market strategists pointed to a further set of good economic data on the economy as the UK trade deficit with non-EC countries came out smaller than expected. Even the setbacks in Japanese and US equities failed to upset London; Nick Knight, the ebullient guru at Nomura in London, advised clients to 'switch Japan into the UK'. There was no immediate reaction to the latest Gallup survey of UK consumer confidence conducted on behalf of the European Commission, which suggested that optimism over the economy may have 'come to an abrupt end'. London market analysts were impressed by the French decision to cut intervention rates 'without waiting for a nod from the Bundesbank' and some believed that wide-ranging changes in the ERM were imminent. But while the non-EC trade figures, together with last week's statistics on UK unemployment and inflation, have strengthened hopes that economic recovery has truly taken hold, some analysts continued to show concern over the high ratings of the UK stock market. 'Equities are still trying to have their cake and eat it,' observed Mr Rob Buckland at NatWest Securities. Seaq volume of 570.4m shares compared with Friday's total of 712.5m, worth Pounds 1.43bn in retail activity. Non-Footsie business made up around 63 per cent of yesterday's total, with trading boosted by at least one trading programme in the second half of the session. Among the features of the day were the final dealings in the rights issue from Zeneca, in a pharmaceuticals sector gaining little benefit from the strength of the dollar. First dealings in Northern Ireland Electricity established the expected premium.</p>

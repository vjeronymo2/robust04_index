			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / UK Company News: The Telegraph directors repeat Southam deal recommendation THE TELEGRAPH, the newspaper group 68 per cent owned by Mr Conrad Black's Hollinger Group, has sent shareholders a second circular about the Pounds 72.3m deal to buy a stake in Southam, the Canadian newspaper company. The new circular, which was necessitated by the purchase of an 18.8 per cent stake in Southam by Power Corporation of Canada, again recommends minority shareholders to vote in favour of the deal. At a special meeting to be held on April 13 Hollinger will not vote, but holders of 8.3 per cent of the shares will support the resolution. The Telegraph has also joined the list of companies paying a second interim dividend to beat the Budget changes on advance corporation tax. It will pay the 6.5p dividend on April 5 so allowing shareholders the benefit of a 25 per cent rather than a 20 per cent tax credit. The circular says that the Power investment in CDollars 180m (Pounds 100m) new shares in Southam, 'will strengthen Southam's balance sheet' and that 'Power, with Hollinger and The Telegraph, will add to the pressure for an improvement in Southam's performance'. The Telegraph's independent directors said that the Telegraph's ability to influence Southam 'may be diminished by the presence of Power' but an agreement between Power and Hollinger would mean that the three would be 'a powerful force for change at Southam'. Together they would hold more than 37 per cent of the shares. They added that the changes to the deal would not alter the financial effects of the investment on The Telegraph. The independent directors acknowledged that Power's investment at CDollars 14 a share, compared to the offer of shares to The Telegraph at CDollars 18.10 a share, 'has received comment'. 'It is clear that the lower price paid by Power is to its advantage', however such an opportunity was not on offer to The Telegraph, they added. The first circular was posted on March 13. It was between March 13 and March 15, before shareholders received that document, the new circular reveals, that Hollinger began negotiating the deal with Power. The Telegraph learned of the discussions on March 16. Power's proposal to Southam was accepted on March 18 and The Telegraph's shareholders were told on March 19. The egm called for today, before the change in the deal, will be adjourned.</p>

			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> JUDGE OKS SEX-FOR-SECRETS BOOK  </P> <P> A federal judge today refused to stop distribution of a book about former  Marine Sgt. Clayton Lonetree, who was court-martialed in the sex-for-secrets  scandal at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.  </P> <P> Lonetree claimed that the book, "The Court-Martial of Clayton Lonetree," is  based on confidential information obtained by his defense team and jeopardizes  his appeal. His complaint filed earlier this month named publisher Henry Holt  and Co. Inc. of New York and sought $100,000 in punitive damages.  </P> <P> But U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton ruled that Lonetree had waited too long  to try to stop the book's publication. Holt published the book in June and says  it has sold about half of the 13,000 copies printed.  </P></p>

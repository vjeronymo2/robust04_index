			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 6 (XINHUA) -- China today published a  namelist of more than 60,000 correspondents from about 1,300  media organizations.    This is the first time for the country to provide reporters'  names to the public en masse.    The namelist was carried in a handbook entitled "Namelist of  China's News Organizations and Reporters", edited by the  PEOPLE'S DAILY, the Communist Party's official newspaper.    Editors said that the publication benefits "the  reinforcement  of the relationship between media and the people, the  improvement of social supervision on the news circle," and is  "an action that holds responsibility to readers."    An intensified information flow is pushing different walks  of  life to make frequent use of the media.    The selected media include the most authoritative and  influential newspapers, radio and television stations, and news  agencies in modern China.    China now has more than 2,000 newspapers and about 1,600  radio and television stations. "The publication helps us to  know the basic situation of the media and improve management and  morality in the media circle," said Liang Heng, vice-director of  the Press and Publication Administration.    The handbook lists the reporter's name, professional title,  working department and reporting field. Photos were added for  the leaders of certain news organizations.    These names were provided to the editors by the personnel  departments of news entities without informing the concerned  correspondents beforehand.</p>

			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / LDP poised for poll success JAPAN's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is likely to tighten its hold on power in tomorrow's upper house election. The main point of interest is whether there will be a record low turnout of voters. Barring an unlikely last minute swing away from the LDP, the opposition Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ) will be humiliated after an uninspiring campaign. The perception that the SDPJ, formerly the Socialist Party, does not provide a real alternative to the LDP has been highlighted by opinion polls showing 40 per cent 'don't know' responses. This reflects general discontent with the state of politics. Mr Shin Kanemaru, the LDP vice-president and 'godfather', suggested newspaper polls showing a large LDP lead were part of a 'conspiracy' to encourage voters to turn against the ruling party or to shun the election and spend the day at the beach. Half the nation's 252 upper house seats are at stake, and the LDP is likely to win 70 or more, leaving it in a strong position to regain a majority lost in 1989, when the Socialist Party appeared capable of challenging LDP leadership in the more powerful lower house. The contrast between the opposition party's enthusiastic 1989 campaign and the lacklustre effort this year could not be more striking. With a campaign targeted almost solely against legislation allowing Japanese servicemen to join UN peacekeeping operations, the SDPJ has been unable to capitalise on concerns about a flagging economy. Mr Makoto Tanabe, the SDPJ leader, has conceded that the campaign was poorly handled, much to the delight of the LDP, which is tainted by bribery scandals and its failure to deliver promised political reforms.</p>

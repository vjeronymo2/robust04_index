			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA has asked users of alcohol screening devices to provide both acceptance and field performance data to the agency's Office of Alcohol and State Programs (OASP) when such data are available. As we explained in the February notice, if information gathered indicates that a device on the CPL is not performing in accordance with the Model Specifications, that a manufacturer is not complying with FDA's Good Manufacturing Practices, or that a device's label does not comply with FDA's Labeling regulations, an investigation would be conducted and appropriate measures would be taken. For these reasons, the Model Specifications have not been amended to provide for the evaluation of disposable devices throughout their useful life. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA accepts the recommendation that certain devices should be tested under a variety of light conditions. The Model Specifications have been amended to provide that interpretive devices which require that results be checked through a visual inspection should be tested under incandescent, mercury vapor, sodium vapor and daylight as well as fluorescent conditions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To conform with the Model Specifications, the notice proposed that the device must perform with no positive results at each test performed at .000 BAC, not more than one positive result at each test performed at .008 BAC and not more than one non-positive result at each test performed at .032 BAC. If the device is capable of providing a reading of greater than 0.000 BAC and less than 0.020 BAC, the notice proposed that the device must perform with not more than one such result at .000 BAC. No comments were received regarding this aspect of the proposal. It has been adopted without change, except that the final Model Specifications clarify that there can be no more than one ``can't tell'' result for disposable interpretive devices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4. FDA Involvement <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When alcohol screening devices are used for medical purposes, the manufacturers of the devices are required to obtain marketing clearance from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in accordance with FDA regulations that address issues such as quality assurance in manufacturing, shelf-life and labeling. Currently, FDA does not assert jurisdiction (provide marketing clearance) for alcohol screening devices used for law enforcement purposes and workplace testing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, because of the nature of alcohol screening devices and the conditions under which they are to be used, NHTSA stated in its February 15 notice that it is important for manufacturers of these devices to conform with certain requirements, imposed by FDA on devices used for medical purposes, prior to the inclusion of the devices on NHTSA's CPL. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, NHTSA proposed to require that each device submitted for testing under the Model Specifications be accompanied by a self-certification from the manufacturer, certifying that it meets the requirements contained in FDA's Good Manufacturing Practices regulations for devices used for medical purposes (21 CFR Part 820), and that the device's label meets the requirements contained in FDA's Labeling regulations for devices used for medical purposes (21 CFR Part 809.10), even if the devices are not to be used for medical purposes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA received a number of comments regarding this aspect of its proposal. One commenter favored direct FDA regulation of all workplace alcohol testing products and, if necessary, FDA enforcement. This commenter encouraged DOT and NHTSA to continue their discussions with FDA. Another commenter agreed that the guidelines written in FDA's Good Manufacturing Practices regulation could be useful as a basis for labeling and manufacturing requirements, but this and other commenters recommended that FDA not get involved. According to one commenter, ``FDA is already overloaded, and long delays could result from their involvement in this project.'' Another commenter recommended that, ``if an instrument is not to be used in the medical field .&blank;.&blank;. FDA [should] not assert jurisdiction.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By requiring a self-certification, NHTSA was not proposing to require that manufacturers obtain FDA marketing clearance, but simply that the manufacturers self-certify that they meet the above-referenced requirements. NHTSA stands by this aspect of its proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For technical assistance or a copy of the Device Good Manufacturing Practices Manual for Medical Devices, manufacturers should contact FDA's Division of Small Manufacturers by calling toll free at 1&hyph;800&hyph;638&hyph;2041. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA's February notice included, as an Appendix, a proposed set of Labeling Instructions for Alcohol Screening Devices that had been prepared in consultation with FDA to assist manufacturers of alcohol screening devices in developing a label that conforms to 21 CFR Part 809.10. The labeling instructions addressed issues such as restrictions that may apply to operators of the device and conditions under which the device should or should not be operated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One respondent commented on certain aspects of the labeling instructions. The commenter supported the inclusion of details on calibration, calibration frequency, and the manufacturer's name, address, and telephone and fax numbers, but disagreed that an ``800'' number is necessary. In addition, the commenter stated that frequency is subject to use, and some users will prefer to return a unit to the manufacturer rather than engage in its calibration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the convenience of users, many of whom will be conducting alcohol screening tests in the field, the Labeling Instructions for Alcohol Screening Devices, which are included as an Appendix to today's notice, continue to provide that manufacturers list an 800 number the user may contact for further information or technical assistance. With regard to the calibration of devices, the Labeling Instructions continue to provide that disposable devices are pre-calibrated, and need no additional calibration. They also continue to provide that reusable devices require calibration, and instruct that the labels on such devices provide information regarding how calibrations are to be conducted, instructions for calibration and recalibration and the criteria for acceptability of calibration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / International Company News: Telecom NZ suffers downturn HEAVY restructuring costs have led to a sharp fall in profits at Telecom Corporation of New Zealand. The company, controlled by Bell Atlantic and Ameritech, has announced a profit of NZDollars 108m (USDollars 58.6m) for the financial year to March 31, in line with analysts' predictions, after absorbing a restructuring charge of NZDollars 350m after tax. The restructuring includes laying off 5,500 staff by 1995. Mr Peter Shirtcliffe, the chairman, said earnings excluding abnormal restructuring costs would have been NZDollars 458m, compared with NZDollars 444m in 1991-92. The chairman said the company was expecting another pleasing year, and intended continuing to increase its dividends to shareholders. The company increased its final dividend by one cent to 8.5 cents a share.</p>

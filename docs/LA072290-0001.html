			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRODERICK MURDERS  </P> <P> Under a bill (AB 2613) proposed by Assemblyman Jerry Eaves (D-Rialto), a woman  who commits premeditated murder, shooting her husband in his sleep, would be  entitled to go free if she could claim to have been a victim of battered  women's syndrome. Similarly, a woman who kills her child may now defend a  murder charge by pleading postpartum psychosis.  </P> <P> Women who abuse their husbands ought to be arrested and forced into a treatment  program for female batterers. Unfortunately, there are no such programs in  California. Our state has adopted radical, feminist policies that see men as  inherently violent and marriage as inherently demeaning to women. The feminist  party line says only men can be capable of initiating violence within the  family. As long as the California Legislature continues to enact  domestic-violence laws based on these flawed assumptions, real solutions to the  problem of female violence against men will remain elnusive.  </P> <P> MICHAEL B.

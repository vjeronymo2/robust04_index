			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / World Trade News: Malaysia power order for Siemens The Siemens power generation group has won a DM300m (Pounds 120m) contract in Malaysia to build a 400MW gas turbine power station, writes Kieran Cooke in Kuala Lumpur. The contract, awarded by Tenaga Nasional, Malaysia's partially privatised electricity utility, is one of several multi-million dollar deals either awarded or under consideration in Malaysia. The country's near double-digit growth over recent years has caused an unexpected surge in electricity demand. The government has given new emphasis to the power sector, following several recent black-outs. The Siemens power plant will be built at Serdang, near Kuala Lumpur, and is scheduled for completion by the end of next year.</p>

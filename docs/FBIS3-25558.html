Panou  Koffi, spokesman for the pro-Eyadema Togolese People's Rally  (RPT) explained the decision by saying "People were prevented  from voting" in Sunday's second, run-off round of general  elections.    The opposition coalition meanwhile claimed victory,  declaring  that had taken at least 42 of the 81 parliamentary seats, which  would compel General Eyadema to choose a prime minister from its  ranks. But the smaller opposition party, the Togolese Union  for Democracy (UTD) warned that it would quit the new parliament  if results were annulled in five constituencies where the RPT  has accused its rivals of violence and vote-rigging. [passage  omitted]    The national electoral commission has announced that the  opposition had taken a two-seat lead over Eyadema's supporters  with 39 to 37, with the outcome known in 77 constituencies.    Former transitional premier Joseph Koffigoh, who stood as an  independent, also won a seat in the West African country's first  multi-party polls, but it was not clear which way he would lean.  Imposed on Eyadema in 1991 by a national conference to pave the  way for multi-party democracy, Koffigoh was subsequently accused  by opposition parties of falling into the camp of Togo's ruler.    The election results contested by the government concern a  seat officially said to have been taken by the opposition and  the four constituencies where the outcome had yet to be  announced. On unofficial figures, the opposition was said to  have won all four.    "If there is an annulment, the UTD will pull out of the  game," Ajavon Ata Messan, secretary general of the party and its  candidate in a Lome constituency contested by the government,  told AFP. "It won't take part in anything, in any case not the  new national assembly," he added. On official results, the UTD  has so far won six seats. [passage omitted]    Electoral commission chief Garba Sipophon on Tuesday said  the  body would deliver its findings in the evening to the Supreme  Court, the sole authority empowered to rule on the validity or  the annulment of votes.    The Burkinabe head of an international team of election  monitors, Hermann Yameogo, said he would "not be astonished" if  the court decided to annul some results.    The interior ministry denounced "regrettable and  anti-democratic incidents," declaring that "a number of voters  were not able to make their choice freely." [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Stock exchange to relax rules on flotations THE stock exchange in London is relaxing its rules on flotations following the series of poorly-received public offers this summer. Corporate financiers are being told that the exchange's rules for obtaining listings will be interpreted flexibly in the light of current market circumstances. The exchange is understood to be concerned by the lack of demand from the public for flotations such as MFI Furniture Group, The Telegraph, Taunton Cider and Anglian Group. In each case most of the shares offered to the public were left with underwriters. New issues usually attract large numbers of private investors and shares are many times over-subscribed. This has led to sharp rises in the share price of the company when trading started. The exchange is also thought to be worried by the effect the low level of demand for flotations has on the after-market. An offer is usually only considered a success if the shares start trading at a premium to their offer price. The exchange's rules state that new applicants for a listing involving the sale of shares worth more than Pounds 30m must make a public offer. However, the exchange allows issuers to place up to half the shares with institutions on a firm basis. It has shown a willingness to go beyond that for large issues. In MFI's case, for example, three-quarters of the shares were placed in firm hands with only a quarter offered to the public. Now the exchange has said 'it has no objection to firm placing of up to 100 per cent of a marketing subject to there being sufficient clawback arrangements to satisfy public demand'. This would mean that a company's banks and brokers could place all of a share offer with institutions, as long as there were provisions for shares to be taken back from these buyers if members of the public applied for shares. However, institutions do not like such open-ended arrangements, fearing that if an issue is a success they will lose a lot of shares to the public and will be left with shares in less attractive issues.

			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRED AMERICAN SAYS JAPANESE DISCRIMINATE  </P> <P> One of the top-ranking American executives at Hakuhodo Advertising America Inc.  said Friday that he was fired "without merit" and may sue the company for what  he called a "history of discrimination against Americans" at the agency.  </P> <P> "I deeply regret having to do this," said Kent Charles Cooper, vice president  and director of public relations at the Los Angeles office of the Japanese  agency. "But I intend to show a long, consistent pattern of discrimination."  </P> <P> Hakuhodo executives strongly deny the allegations. "What he says is not true,"  said Tadashi Toma, executive vice president and general manager at the office.  "We have only three Japanese on a staff of 40. It is only an internal  adjustment."  </P> <P> About 90% of the agency's U.S employees are American, said Taka Arai, associate  general manager at the office. "He was laid off based on his performance," Arai  said. "He's taking it too personally."  </P> <P> But Cooper, 30, claimed that a total of nine Americans have been fired from  Hakuhodo in recent weeks, including Brian Ribbey, who, as vice president and  management director, was the senior ranking American in the Los Angeles office.  </P> <P> Ribbey, however, sees things differently from Cooper. "I don't think they  listen to what American management has to say about the company," said Ribbey,  "but I don't think that's discriminatory." He said the layoffs occurred because  the agency is trying to cut its budget.  </P> <P> The layoffs at Hakuhodo began shortly after the agency spent nearly $1 million  but still failed to land the much sought-after ad business for American Suzuki  Motor Corp. Although the firm's Japanese parent company ranks as one of the  largest agency's in the world with annual billings of $4 billion, its Los  Angeles office has struggled for business since it opened 13 years ago. Some  sources estimate that the office, whose largest clients are All Nippon Airways  and Hitachi, may be losing upward of $1 million annually.  </P> <P> The woman who is filling in as public relations director said she doesn't think  the agency discriminates against Americans. "I'm a white, American woman who is  now head of public relations at Hakuhodo," said Jo DeLyon, acting vice  president of public relations. "Is that discrimination?"  </P> <P> Cooper was unwilling to detail specifics of the alleged discrimination. He said  he is now in the process of hiring an attorney, and he wants to wait for legal  guidance.  </P></p>

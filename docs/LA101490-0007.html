			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OBSERVATIONS ON 'THE CIVIL WAR'  </P> <P> In most wars, a phony moral issue has to be dreamed up to get people to fight,  and historians tend to perpetuate the myths to justify their side's engagement  in a murderous conflict.  </P> <P> The Civil War was no different.  </P> <P> There was an economic deadlock between the industrial North and the agrarian  South. The war was fought not for any noble aim on either side but for selfish  control of the nation and for materialism -- the ascendancy of one section over  the other.  </P> <P> Even though it was England and the Northern bankers and shipping interests that  transported slaves to our land, the slaves were ill-equipped for the severity  of Northern winters and they fit in with the demand for more field hands in the  South (generated by the cotton industry).  </P> <P> BEN AUSTIN  </P> <P> San Marino  </P></p>

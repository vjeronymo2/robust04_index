			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / International Company News: Boeing forced to cut more staff and production Boeing, the world's largest commercial aircraft manufacturer, is to reduce production of its 737 and 747 jets further next year and cut its workforce by between 2,000 and 3,000 because of continued recession in the world aviation industry. The move comes on top of a programme, announced early this year, to sharply cut production of its 737, 747, 757 and 767 jets, which involves the loss of some 28,000 jobs. Mr Ron Woodard, executive vice-president of the company's Commercial Airplane business, said yesterday: 'While there are some signs of improvement in the air travel market, losses or inadequate profits continue at many airlines.' 'Until more customers are in a position to order new airplanes, we must reduce our production, as painful as that is for our employees, for our suppliers and for our communities.' Production of the 747 jumbo jet, which is now at five a month and is due to drop to three in February, will fall to two a month from January 1995. The smaller, twin-engined 737 aircraft, now produced at 10 a month, will drop to 8.5 a month next November. The cutbacks will have a significant knock-on effect on parts suppliers such as Northrop, the Los Angeles-based group which makes fuselage sections for the 747. They will also have an impact on the economy of Seattle, Washington State, where most of Boeing's 118,000 employees work. Yesterday's announcement dashed hopes that Boeing would be able to shore up its current production rates with its share of an impending order for up to 60 aircraft from Saudi, the Saudi Arabian state-run carrier. The order is also being pursued by rivals McDonnell Douglas and Airbus Industrie. That order is likely to be the last big one for many months in a market which has battered the main three manufacturers.</p>

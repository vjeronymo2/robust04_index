In his interview with INTERFAX, Zukhurov  indicated that Tajikistan's official delegation is not going to  Moscow to meet with the opposition in the near term.    In his words, the Tajik leadership has not received an  invitation from another mediator at the negotiations, a special  envoy of the UN General Secretary. In addition, members and  leadership of the delegation are to meet with the Tajik  leadership to concretely determine authorities and mandate of  the delegation, he said.    "We shall hardly be able to work out this issues before 28  March," said Zukhurov. He also reported that the delegation  headed by him is ready to sit at the negotiations table with the  opposition's delegation headed by any of its leaders." At the  same time he said that it is unclear who will head the  delegation and how many members will be in it.</p>

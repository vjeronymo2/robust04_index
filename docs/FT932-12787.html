			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tory backbenchers urge rethink on oil tax SENIOR TORY backbenchers last night called on the government to revise its proposed changes to the North Sea tax regime following an outcry in the oil industry. Many companies say the government's changes to petroleum revenue taxes would lead to a halving of exploration activity and the loss of up to 40,000 jobs. Mr John Butterfill, Conservative MP for Bournemouth East, tabled an amendment to the Finance Bill which would provide some transitional relief for oil companies affected by the tax changes. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, proposed in the Budget a reduction in the PRT rate from 75 per cent to 50 per cent and the abolition of tax relief for exploratory drilling. Mr John Watts, Tory chairman of the Treasury and Civil Service committee, also urged a change to the transitional relief proposals. In moving the oil taxation 'pendulum' from one extreme to another, the government may have gone too far, Mr Watts said. Speaking as the finance bill im-plementing the Budget measures received its second Commons reading, Mr Watts said transitional relief should be allowed in cases where companies had contractual obligations to incur expenditure that had been entered into in the expectation that relief would apply. Mr Butterfill, vice-chairman of the Tory Backbench finance committee, has suggested that tax relief for exploration work to which the industry is already commited is maintained. This could be paid for by raising the PRT rate to 55 per cent until the end of December 1996. The proposal addresses one of the industry's prime concerns about the new tax regime. Many explorers were angry that tax relief would not apply to wells they had committed to drill as part of their applications to the Department of Trade and Industry for oil exploration licences. The industry has committed to drill between 160 and 180 wells which would have qualified for tax relief under the previous regime. Although the Treasury says those wells are not legally binding, Mr Tim Eggar, industry minister, confirmed - in a parliamentary answer - that he expects the industry to stick to obligations made under previous licensing rounds. Winding up last night's finance bill debate, Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, adopted a conciliatory tone, saying the government recognised the need to avoid 'unnecessary dislocation' and would endeavour to do so. Labour and the Scottish National party both joined the calls for a rethink. For Labour, Ms Harriet Harman, a frontbench Treasury spokeswoman, said it was 'extraordinary' that the Finance Bill contained oil taxation measures which 'on the chancellor's own admission' would result in at least 10,000 job losses.</p>

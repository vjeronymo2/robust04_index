When asked about his first activities as a  member of the security cabinet, Parrinello Blanco outlined his  emergency plan and emphasized that we cannot expect a miracle,  meaning Guatemala cannot become the safest place in the world in  24 hours. He clearly said he will be strict, but he will abide  by the law. He added that under his leadership, he and the  security forces will respect human rights and work with honesty  and without arrogance, disrespect, or abuse.    Nevertheless, he said that although no miracles are  expected,  he is sure his emergency plan will make it possible to stabilize  the country's security sector in two months. He explained that  this entails orienting all crime prevention measures in three  specific areas. The areas to attack are kidnapping, drug  trafficking, and the crime that is now part of the citizens'  daily lives -- attacks on bus passengers and pedestrians, for  example.    Minister Parrinello Blanco said that although violence and  crime affect all Guatemalans, they mainly afflict the poorest  people. The majority of them take to the streets and only  protect themselves by making the sign of the cross and putting  themselves in God's hands. I am interested in establishing  conditions that protect everyone, particularly the people who  worry about traveling by public transportation or walking to the  bus stop or those who are being mugged at this moment.    He insisted that his main goal is to improve conditions for  everyone's safety but special emphasis will be given to the  masses who carry their bimonthly pay or the money to buy the  children's medicine or food in their pockets. Generally  speaking, Minister Parrinello Blanco said he intends to act  firmly so the state may guarantee the life and assets of all  citizens. He also said he will act "with honesty and integrity,  and without disrespect, abuse, or arrogance. We will be strict,  but we will abide by the law," he insisted.</p>

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Arts: Today's Television A survey commissioned by Business Matters (7.30 BBC2) compares the share price performance of companies in which families own more than 25 per cent of the stock with the FT All Share Index and shows that in the 21 years after 1970 the family companies out-performed the FT index substantially. It seems that the UK's top performing family company is a mail order business called N Brown which disregards slimming and fitness fads and sells the sort of outsize clothes so many Britons need and so many shops don't sell. Can it really be that easy? Not if your business happens to be property, perhaps. This Week (10.40 ITV) investigates the misery caused by the most recent property crash, talking to the inhabitants of Gigha, a Hebridean island now owned by a Zurich bank. It seems that the property company of entrepreneur Malcolm Potier, 'Laird' of Gigha, went the way of Mountleigh and Canary Wharf. If this week's Pandora's Box (9.30 BBC2) is again concerned with the impact of science upon society let's hope it does not repeat last week's mistake and confuse science with sociology and politics. Today's subject is the Rand Corporation.</p>

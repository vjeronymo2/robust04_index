			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 23 (KCNA) -- The Korean Committee for  Asian-African Solidarity sent a letter to the tri-continental  people's solidarity organization on May 18 calling upon it to  expose to the international community the truth behind the  criminal nuclear development of the South Korean authorities.    The letter calls attention to the fact that the South Korean  authorities have stepped up their own nuclear developmant behind  the facade of the anti-DPRK campaign of the U.S. over its  "nuclear issue.    According to it, the pressurized heavy water reactor (PHWR)  in Wolsong camouflaged as a "commercial" reactor and the  multi-purpose reactor in Taedok disguised as one for "research"  constitute the backbone in the production of fissionable  material in South Korea at present.    The Wolsong PHWR which started operation in 1983 has so far  yielded plutonium enough to make more than 370 nuclear warheads.    As South Korean experts of nuclear development have already  confessed, in introducing the PHWR from Canada the South Korean  authorities sought to obtain high-grade plutonium from natural  uranium by their own efforts. And they considered that with  this heavy water reactor they could evade an international  inspection because spent nuclear fuel could be abstracted from  it any moment without stopping its operating.    It is not fortuitous that a South Korean official dealing  with atomic energy said "like businesses keeping a double  account-book, one can register 10 kg of nuclear fuel after  dealing with 1,000 kg daily."    The multi-purpose research reactor in South Korea also is  one  for the development of nuclear weapons, not for the "peaceful  development of atomic energy". It is so designed as to be  remodelled without difficulty for the production of plutonium  and to produce spent nuclear fuel containing high-grade  plutonium in a shorter period than the PHWR.    Now, South Korea has not only the PHWR and the multi-purpose  research reactor but even post-irradiation test facilities  capable of abstracting plutonium by reprocessing spent nuclear  fuel therefrom.    This notwithstanding, the United States and the  International  Atomic Enery Agency [IAEA] have connived at the PHWR in Wolsong  and the multi-purpose research reactor in Taedok, South Korea,  used for military purposes, while taking issue with the North's  5-megawatt experimental nuclear power station, and magnified the  fictitious "nuclear suspicion" against the North and used it as  an excuse for implementing their policy of stifling the DPRK.    This is an outrage and act of aggression which must be  allowed on no account either in view of peace on the Korean  peninsula or in view of international justice and impartiality.    The ever more undisguised nuclear racket of the United  States  is a product of its strategic ambition to bind not only the DPRK  but other non-nuclear states and developing countries to the  nuclear chain for ever and dominate them by the nuclear stick.    We believe that your organization will widely organize unity  and joint action of the peoples on the three continents to  expose to the international community the truth behind the U.S.  imperialists' nuclear racket against the DPRK and behind the  criminal nuclear development of the South Korean authorities  stepped up behind the scene and contribute to the creation of an  international environment favorable to peace and reunification  of Korea.    At the same time, we call for a joint struggle to accuse the  IAEA of its partiality in defending nuclear powers and  encroaching upon the sovereignty of non-nuclear states and to  establish a new nuclear control order based on international  impartiality.</p>

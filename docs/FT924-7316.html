			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / International Company News: Record take-up for GM card A CREDIT card launched by General Motors in September has won more than 2m accounts and accumulated more than Dollars 500m in balances in less than 60 days, making it the most successful US credit card introduction ever. The card is a general-purpose MasterCard, with no annual fee, which allows holders to save up to Dollars 3,500 or more on the purchase of a new GM vehicle. The build-up in accounts has been even faster than that of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph's Universal card, which had one million accounts 78 days after its launch in 1990 and is now the fifth-largest credit card in the nation, ranked by accounts. GM said it reached the 1m milestone after just 28 days. Mr Kurt Peters, publisher of Credit Card News, a Chicago-based newsletter, said the GM achievement was 'quite remarkable'. The card would already rank as the 20th largest in the US, by number of accounts, if placed in the 1991 rankings compiled by the newsletter. Credit cards, offering fat profit margins because of the high interest they charge on rolled-over debt, have become an area of increasingly intense competition between traditional US bank issuers and new entrants such as GM and AT&amp;T, luring consumers with rebates on goods and services. Mr Peters said GM had not introduced a new element to the battle but had intensified the existing competition. 'This turns up the heat on the whole industry,' he added. GM's main purpose in launching the card has been to secure customer loyalty for its vehicles and sell more of them. The group has seen its car market share plunge from some 46 per cent at the start of the 1980s to around 35 per cent now. However, the credit card business is also meant to operate profitably once launch costs are out of the way. The card's success stems in part from GM's immense marketing muscle as America's leading vendor of vehicles. It opened the campaign with a network television advertising campaign and direct mailings to more than 30m homes. It has been encouraging consumers to abandon their existing credit cards by moving debt from those accounts to the GM card to earn more vehicle rebate money. The company said some 10 per cent of the 2m accounts had involved this balance consolidation feature, with an average transfer of some Dollars 2,000. Mr Peters noted that leading bank credit card issuers had been saying they were not losing a lot of customers to GM, which suggested that the company's account holders were simply carrying additional cards in their wallets. However, Mr Ronald Zebeck, managing director of GM's credit card operations, said consumers were using the GM card 12 times a month, compared with an industry average of 3.5 times monthly, and the average purchase was Dollars 112, compared to an industry average of Dollars 58.</p>

			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BERNSON'S WRONG TO BLAME SIMI VALLEY  </P> <P> This letter is in regards to your article of 7-25-90 entitled "Bernson  Criticizes Lands Suit."  </P> <P> Contrary to Bernson's opinion, Simi Valley did not act rashly in voting to sue  Los Angeles.  </P> <P> In fact, they are as sick of Los Angeles' political shenanigans as Los Angeles  residents are. The environmental impact report, prepared by the developer at  his expense, does not adequately address the issues or show solutions to the  problems that this massive Porter Ranch project will spread to all surrounding  areas.  </P> <P> To blame Simi Valley residents for all the traffic on the Simi freeway is  ludicrous. There are jobs and industry in Simi and Moorpark where Simi Valley  residents work. Bernson's proposal of "an employment tax against non-Los  Angeles residents" who commute is just another example of his shortsighted,  developer-oriented "Band-Aid" brand of politics.  </P> <P> It is especially interesting that Bernson thinks PRIDE members have  "hoodwinked, sweet-talked, duped or whatever by Simi Valley into initiating a  lawsuit."  </P> <P> If what Bernson says is the truth, PRIDE was able to accomplish quite a feat.  PRIDE didn't seem to have enough sophistication to get the Los Angeles City  Council members or the Mayor to respond to the legitimate concerns voiced by  PRIDE.  </P> <P> JANIE STUCKER  </P> <P> Northridge  </P></p>

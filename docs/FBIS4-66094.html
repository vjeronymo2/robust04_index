			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [EC Document No. DOC/IP/94/419: "Baltic Information </F> Infrastructure Pilot Project"]    [Text] Mr. Bangemann has announced today in Riga the  launching of a pilot project, to improve the information  infrastructure in the Baltic sates. The project constitutes a  first success of the round table where leading industrialists of  the European Union and the three Baltic states discussed the  possibilities for foreign direct investment and industrial  cooperation.    In the Baltic states, data networking has so far been less  of  a priority than voice communications in the telecom sector, and  is hindered much by bottlenecks in the technical delivery  systems.    The Baltic project will contribute to resolve some of these  bottlenecks. It is also designed to develop some information  services which will then be available on the network: company  databases, exchange rate information, privatisation data.    Potential end-users of such information services, such as  banks, have already shown interest to be actively involved in  the project, and the value of the services accessible via the  up-graded network will soon appear clearly. Since Western  companies would be an important end-user in the view of Baltic  business, the pilot action will include Western partners.    The action which starts today will receive 600,000 ECU of  European Commission funding, for a period of 12 months. In  April 1995, a workshop will examine the experiences made and  ideas for future development.</p>

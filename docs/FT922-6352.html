			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / People: It's a long way . It's a long way from deepest Sussex to the heart of Kalamazoo, even if it is Kalamazoo Business Systems, Birmingham, rather than Kalamazoo, Michigan. Too long, in the end, for John Burgess, Kalamazoo's former managing director who grew tired of the daily journey from home to office and the social and family difficulties it entailed. After three years with the company, he has now left to pursue, other, as yet unidentified interests although colleagues expect to see him reappear in a selling role before long. The gap at the top of Kalamazoo is being filled for the time being by Ian Davidson, the group finance director, while headhunters seek a replacement for Burgess.</p>

			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / International Company News: Pan Am resumes services PAN AM, the financial-ly-pressed US airline which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier this year, said yesterday it would resume transatlantic services to London later this month, writes Nikki Tait. Its announcement comes as profitability in the US industry recovers from the shock of the Gulf war. Pan Am sold its routes into London's Heathrow airport to United Airlines in April, after its cash needs had become acute. Its jets will now fly into Gatwick airport only. Pan Am said its daily non-stop Miami-London service would start on May 18, using Boeing 747 equipment. Although this authority has been operated by United recently, Pan Am said it would honour all reservations issued by the larger carrier for flights after May 17. On May 23 it will resume service on the Detroit-London route.</p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (32): New media for managers MOST PEOPLE dislike offering or receiving criticism. So the current fad for performance appraisal and performance management cannot be explained by any populism. The only explanation for their popularity is that they are perceived as techniques for improving performance at a time when improved performance is crucial for survival. How then to make it work? How can one offer criticism without hurting the feelings of the other party? Criticism and Performance Appraisal (Viewtech, Pounds 325 each plus p&amp;p) tackles these subjects. Though produced for and aimed at the American market, and though they occasionally do not recognise the basic insecurity which is the root of the problem, they do offer guidelines which can make both processes easier and more acceptable. * * * If you have heard of Tony Buzan, you will know that he is associated with a technique known as Mind Maps. This is difficult to describe briefly in mere words, since its whole nature and purpose is to get away from linear arrangement of words, so as to arrange information in non-linear manner by graphic as well as verbal means. Mind maps can be used for collecting, organising and visualising to-do lists and action plans, planning and recording meetings, problem-solving and brainstorming, arranging information in non-linear fashion for lecture notes, etc. Users of Mind Maps will be pleased to hear that it is now possible to buy a computer software programme called InfoMap (CoCo Systems, Pounds 119.99 plus p/p). For various reasons, some people may prefer to continue using Mind Maps with pencil and paper, but the main advantage of using InfoMap is that it makes it possible to save quite a bit of time in using the technique. InfoMap also makes it possible to integrate the use of Mind Maps with other computer applications such as word processing, and enables three or four pages of notes to be attached to each branch or link in a Mind Map. There are two disadvantages to InfoMap at present. Buzan and CoCo Systems have lost an opportunity of making more converts to Mind Maps by neglecting to include an on-screen introduction to the technique. Readers wanting a proper introduction to the technique can find any of Buzan's numerous books on the subject, or get hold of Tony Buzan's video presentation of the technique, sold under the title Mindpower (BBC Enterprises, Pounds 299). Second, my version of InfoMap is programmed in a way that makes it possible for me to see only part of a whole map, and I need to use my direction keys to access other parts of it; there is, moreover, no necessary indication that there is non-visible portion of a map sitting on the side. No doubt these are aspects they will remedy in future upgrades of the programme. * * * On computer-disk too is The Art of Negotiation (Experience in Software Inc., USA). This also uses the medium intelligently, in that it is designed to help managers not merely to acquire information about the subject in general terms, but also to prepare for any specific real-world negotiation. However, negotiation-related information is available too, and it is reviewed in detail. The programme is somewhat inflexible in that, on subsequent use of the programme, it insists that the user go through the preparation in the precise sequence laid out. This is not ideal for experienced negotiators, though even they may find it helpful. Negotiators who are not very experienced, however, will find it helpful to learn the discipline of going through the stages step by step. On the other hand, though one can skip through the information, it may be irritating to be slowed down by having to skip through the material each time one wants to prepare for a negotiation. Up to date prices and other details of all these products are available as usual from Prism International which has a new telephone number, 0252-725910, and a new fax number: 0252-737152.</p>

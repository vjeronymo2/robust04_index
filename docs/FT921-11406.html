			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Car tax backfired, retail group claims THE government last year raised taxation on motor vehicles so much that it actually lost Pounds 2.1bn of potential revenue through reduced sales, servicing and other activities, the Retail Motor Industry Federation said yesterday. Last year's Budget has also accelerated closures among franchised dealers, with 10 per cent having closed or been sold off last year, the federation claims in a submission to Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. Mr Neil Marshall, the federation's director of economic affairs, said that by the middle of this year a total of 25,000 jobs would have been lost over 12 months among car dealers and distributors. The car trade is the UK's largest retailing sector. In its submission, aimed at influencing March's Budget, the federation calls for the abolition of special car tax; the scrapping of existing plans to impose, from April, National Insurance contribution charges on employers for their employees' private use of company cars, and for companies to be able to claw back 50 per cent of VAT on car purchases. Currently, cars are the only area of businesses' operational expenditure where VAT is non-deductible. Although the government's total tax take from the motor sector did rise again last year, to Pounds 21bn from Pounds 19.9bn according to federation stimates, the extra revenue forgone as a consequence of collapsed confidence and reduced activity was equivalent to a penny in the pound off income tax, Mr Marshall argued.</p>

			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH: TO WIT: THIS COLLECTION OF HUMOR IS ONE FOR THE BOOK  </P> <P> In "Dear Wit: Letters from the World's Wits" (Prentice Hall), H. Jack Lang  gives us a treasury of written wit collected over 50 years.  </P> <P> Wit is not easily defined, but James Thurber came close when he observed that  "The wit makes fun of other persons; the satirist makes fun of the world; the  humorist makes fun of himself."  </P> <P> In his introduction, Lang notes that wit is often caustic -- it has a victim;  but it may also be wise and even gentle. He offers examples of all kinds.  </P> <P> I quote from the book without attention to categories, but mostly I have sought  out the briefest forms. As someone has said, brevity is the soul of wit.  </P> <P> Perhaps I favor the shafts that have victims. George Bernard Shaw once received  this invitation from Winston Churchill's mother: "Lady Randolph Churchill will  be home on Thursday afternoon, next, at four o'clock. RSVP." To which Shaw  replied: "So will George Bernard Shaw."  </P> <P> But the devilish Shaw was outwitted by actress Cornelia Otis Skinner in this  exchange after the New York opening of Shaw's "Candida," in which she played  the lead. Shaw cabled: "Excellent, greatest!" She replied: "Undeserving such  praise." Shaw answered: "Meant the play." She shot back: "So did I."  </P> <P> A professor at Western Reserve University asked Bertrand Russell to fill out a  long and personal questionnaire. Russell replied: "If this is a specimen of  Western reserve, God spare me from Western impudence."  </P> <P> A young woman who had submitted some of her short stories to Somerset Maugham  for criticism asked him, "Do you think I should put more fire in my stories?"  He answered. "No. Vice versa."  </P> <P> Winston Churchill was irrepressible. At a dinner he asked his American hostess,  "May I have a breast?" She explained that in America one asked either for white  meat or dark meat. The next day Churchill sent her an orchid with this note: "I  would be most obliged if you would pin this on your white meat."  </P> <P> The science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke received a cable from William  Randolph Hearst: "Is there life on Mars? Cable thousand words." Clarke cabled  back: "Nobody knows. Repeat 500 times."  </P> <P> When a female admirer asked the playwright Richard Sheridan to explain the  essential difference between men and women, he answered: "I cannot conceive."  </P> <P> One of my favorites is Cary Grant's answer to a cable from an anonymous  magazine editor asking "How old Cary Grant?" Grant replied: "Old Cary Grant  fine. How you?"  </P> <P> Another movie classic is Groucho Marx's reply to an invitation to join a  private club: "I do not wish to belong to the kind of club that accepts people  like me as members."  </P> <P> When a young woman asked Abigail Van Buren if birth control pills were  tax-deductible, Dear Abby replied: "Only if they don't work."  </P> <P> After an accident in which she lost a leg, the divine Sarah Bernhardt received  this cable: "We offer you 100,000 dollars to exhibit your leg at our Exposition  in Buffalo." To which she answered: "Which one?"  </P> <P> An admirer of Sinclair Lewis wrote the famous writer, asking for a job as his  secretary, and promising to "do everything for you -- and when I say everything  I mean everything." Lewis' wife, the redoubtable Dorothy Thompson, answered:  "My husband already has a stenographer who handles his work for him. And, as  for 'everything,' I take care of that myself -- and when I say everything I  mean everything."  </P> <P> Successful authors often receive manuscripts from unpublished writers, asking  for their criticism. Samuel Johnson once advised one young man: "Your work is  both good and original. But the part that is good is not original. And the part  that is original is not good."  </P> <P> The British statesman Benjamin Disraeli had a standard answer to all such  appeals: "Many thanks. I shall lose no time reading it."  </P> <P> The French playwright Georges Courteline received a crude note from an impudent  young writer demanding satisfaction for a minor insult. The note was filled  with misspelled words. Courteline replied: "As I am the offended party, the  choice of weapons is mine. We shall fight with orthography. You are already  dead."  </P> <P> Will Rogers starred in the Ziegfeld Follies during World War I. A young woman  wrote him: "Why aren't you in the Army?" Rogers replied: "For the same reason,  Madam, that you aren't in the Follies -- physical disabilities."  </P> <P> Actress Ilka Chase's marriage to actor Louis Calhern ended after six months. He  soon remarried, and Ilka sent the new bride a box of unused calling cards,  engraved "Mrs. Louis Calhern," with this note: "Hope these reach you in time."  </P> <P> Perhaps it is not wit, but the most charming line in the collection is in a  very brief essay written by Maria Taft, daughter of William Howard Taft III, in  response to her teacher's request for a brief family history.  </P> <P> Maria wrote: "My great-grandfather was President of the United States. My  grandfather was Senator from Ohio. My father is Ambassador to Ireland. I am a  Brownie."  </P></p>

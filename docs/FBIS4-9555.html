			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Banja Luka, April 26 (TANJUG) -- The Bosnian Serb  Army (VRS) on Tuesday [26 April] warned it would `do everything  to protect the lives' of its members and civilians if members of  the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) continued to open fire on  Serb positions and settlements in northern Bosnia, as it said  they had often done in the past ten days. A communique released  by the VRS First Krajina Corps said that UNPROFOR provocations  had been frequent on the Doboj front in the past 30 days, and  that the UNPROFOR command had failed to take any steps to  prevent them, that is, to prevent the direct siding of the  international forces with the Muslims, although its attention  had been drawn to the fact more than once. The communique said  it was regrettable that the silence on the part of higher  UNPROFOR commands meant their tacit approval of further  provocations by UNPROFOR units.    The failure of UNPROFOR commands to respond to the addressed  warnings seems to have encouraged UNPROFOR units to continue  staging military provocations, which have not been countered by  the Serb side, the communique said. The communique said one had  the impression that the direct goal of such UNPROFOR actions was  to provoke a response from Serb forces and then accuse them of  attacking U.N. peace-keepers, which could be used as a pretext  for air strikes against Serb positions, the communique set out.  The communique specified that an UNPROFOR helicopter flew over  Serb positions in the area of Banovici several times on Monday  and opened fire on them. The communique said U.N. peace-keepers  in the occupied Serb village of Poljice, near Maglaj, had  several times opened fire on Serb settlements and positions on  the western slopes of Mount Ozren, and that UNPROFOR units in  Zavidovici had opened fire from armoured vehicles on the Serb  settlement of Dolac.    Columns of armoured UNPROFOR vehicles coming from Lukavac  practically daily demonstrate force only a hundred meters or so  from VRS positions at Milino Selo, Sizje and Donja Brijesnica,  the communique said. The communique recalled Bosnian Croat  reports according to which U.N. peace-keepers are installing  radar systems for the detection of Serb artillery positions in  the area of Maglaj and regularly sending on the relevant  information to Muslim units.</p>

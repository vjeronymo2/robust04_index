			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Kolesnichenko] </F>   [Text] New York, 28 Feb -- The American corporation  "Gerardo International," which works on developing secret  weapons systems for the Pentagon, thinks that Aldrich Ames,  arrested last week on suspicion of spying for the former USSR  and then for Russia, could have supplied Moscow with secrets of  the production of a new invention of the company -- the  so-called "MRX" defense technology. The president of the  corporation, Neil Gerardo, expressed his anxiety at this  circumstance in a letter to Congressman (John Mike) (Republican,  Florida), which has been made available to the ITAR-TASS office  in New York.    The document notes in particular that the company's  management became concerned when one of its staff in Belgium  reported the details of a Reuter interview with LDRP [Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia]) leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy in  which the latter declared for the first time that Russia had an  ultra-secret offensive weapon called "Elipton." The description  of this mysterious weapon given by Zhirinovskiy turned out to be  similar to the "MRX" defense technology developed in the  "Gerardo International" laboratories.    "Our company, like many other institutions that are  developing high-technology weapons systems, knew of and welcomed  the actions of the U.S. Government's intelligence departments in  monitoring our lines of communication, because this met the aims  of national security," the letter pointed out. "Today our  anxiety has increased even more after the arrest of Aldrich Ames  on suspicion of supplying secret information to Moscow. We in  `Gerardo International' have done everything possible to keep  the `MRX' production methods a secret. However, after the  events that have taken place we fear that the technologies of  this system have been 'blown'. We call on Congress to carry out  a thorough investigation of this urgent matter. We should like  to know how many people, and precisely who, have access to  information on the 'MRX' production technologies."    The ITAR-TASS correspondent called a representative of  "Gerardo International," but he flatly refused to comment on the  letter, saying that as yet he had nothing to add to the above  version.</p>

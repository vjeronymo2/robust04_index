			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / City blast worsens scaffold shortage THE SCALE of repairs following the Bishopsgate bomb a fortnight ago is exacerbating a shortage of scaffolding, suppliers say, writes Andrew Taylor. Mr John Cripps, president of the National Association of Scaffolding Contractors, said demand for scaffolding had increased substantially following the bombing. 'I was at an auction of second-hand equipment in south London last week and prices were up to 30 per cent higher than three or four weeks earlier,' said Mr Cripps, director of Plant &amp; Tools, which supplies south London and south-east England. The association said shortages of scaffolding were emerging before the bombing, because of closures and cuts by companies during the recession. This was likely to lead to price rises as construction activity started to improve, particularly house-building. It said that during the recession prices for contract scaffolding had fallen by as much as 40 per cent in some regions. The association said shortages had been exacerbated by large sales of second-hand equipment for use in reconstruction following the Gulf War. The result was the lowest level of scaffolding stocks for many years. Delivery periods for many items were now exceeding four to five weeks. It added that the rise in steel prices announced by British Steel was likely to have an effect on scaffolding prices.</p>

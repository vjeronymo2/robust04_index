			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Patrick Lescot] </F>   [Excerpts] Bangkok, Jan 11 (AFP) -- The future of a unified  opposition in Burma and the opening of talks with its ruling  military junta are the key points of discussion at a meeting of  the Democratic Alliance of Burma (DAB), officials said here  Tuesday.    The meeting, which opened Monday in Mannerplaw, the DAB's  headquarters at the border between Burma and Thailand, comes as  joint pressure from China and Thailand has already resulted in  part of the opposition negotiating a separate ceasefire with the  junta in Rangoon.    "We are scared of a border closure by Thailand, which would  mean no more medical supplies for us," Em Marta told AFP.    Marta is in charge of the foreign affairs department of the  National Karen Union (KNU), the oldest and most powerful  insurgent group fighting the Rangoon junta and whose positions  lie right on the border with Thailand.    According to Marta, the probability of the border's closing  is something "we very much worry about and is the main reason"  that the KNU has asked the DAB for a mandate to negotiate with  the junta on behalf of all the opposition's various factions.  [passage omitted]    Marta said the "the SLORC doesn't matter so much, but with  Thailand, it is another story. We feel the pressure is coming  [words indistinct]. He was referring to recent measures by the  Thai Government to limit and control the Burmese opposition  operating in Thailand.    The Burmese armed forces in December attacked positions held  by Karens, killing five and injuring three, and suffering 20  dead and 30 injured in their own ranks, according to a Karen  spokesman. [passage omitted]    A founding principle of the movement was the refusal to  negotiate as separate factions with the junta.    "We need a mandate, or at least the support of the DAB, to  negotiate," Marta said, adding that the first priority would be  to obtain a ceasefire.    "We feel that Burma needs peace," Marta said. "At this  point,  there are no more preconditions."    The DAB had sought the release of Aung San Suu Kyi, winner  of  the Nobel Peace Prize and opposition leader, who has been under  house arrest since 1989, but this may no longer be a term, he  said.    He cautioned, however, "if there is no political concession  (by the SLORC), such a ceasefire would only be temporary."  [passage omitted]</p>

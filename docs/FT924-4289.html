			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Accountants approve strict ethical rules ACCOUNTANCY FIRMS will not be able to conduct specialist valuations for their audit clients under strict ethical guidelines approved yesterday. Firms will also be required to contact the existing auditor if they are approached by a company to provide a second opinion on an accounting standard, the council of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales said. The two guidance notes, which come into force on February 1, were introduced by the Chartered Accountants Joint Ethics Committee, representing the English Institute and its equivalents in Scotland and Ireland. Their ratification follows several months of consultation. Only one of the leading six accounting firms - believed to be Coopers &amp; Lybrand - opposed the specialist valuations guideline. The note aims to remove any apparent threat to objectivity of the audit by preventing auditors providing actuarial valuations, or valuations of other assets such as intellectual property, brands, other intangible assets, property and unquoted investments. The note on second opinions or 'opinion shopping' is designed to prevent companies hunting for support from the profession when their auditor refuses to approve a particular accounting treatment. It ensures that the second firm approached possesses the full information available to the company's auditor before it passes judgment. The council also yesterday voted to approve additional openness in its disciplinary hearings. It ratified suggestions for greater disclosure of judgments, but has stalled proposals that would lead to open hearings on matters of public interest.</p>

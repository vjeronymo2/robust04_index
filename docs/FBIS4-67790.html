			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kuldip Nayar: ``Deadly embrace''] </F>   [Text] Washington does not come to the point straightaway.  It goes over a process to evolve. Camp David confabulations  spanned the distance between Cairo and Tel Aviv. More recently,  the lawns of the White House witnessed the handshake between the  Israeli Prime Minister and the PLO chief.    The visit of Robin Raphel, head of State Department's South  Asia Bureau, to the subcontinent is the beginning of another  exercise. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott comes to  promote it. Finally, if all goes well, there may be a meeting  between Prime Minister Narasimha Rao and Prime Minister Benazir  Bhutto on the lawns of the White House in the presence of  beaming and clapping President Clinton to parade `the results'.    lt is not that America is fumbling for what it is seeking;  it  is only that it wants to show that `the results' came forth  gradually into being. Process is the key word, not pressure or  prize, although the United States makes a liberal use of it.    For reasons it does not hide, the Clinton administration has  decided to cap nuclear programmes both in India and Pakistan.  The visit by Raphel and Talbott are part of an exercise to bring  it about. The assumption is that both New Delhi and Islamabad  will give in to Washington's thinking.    Starting with Islamabad, America has offered the bait of 38  F-16s, which Pakistan is keen to acquire. (It made tne payment  of $680 million nearly two years ago). The Clinton  administration has said that it will make one-time exception to  the Pressler amendment which forbids any military assistance or  the sale of weapons to a country which possesses the nuclear  device. The price demanded is the capping of nuclear programme  by Pakistan.    Benazir realises that it cannot sell the proposition to a  nation which has been told and retold that it is better to eat  grass than to skimp on manufacturing the bomb. On the other  hand, Benazir very much wants the F-16s. She has reportedly  conveyed to Washington that she may be able to persuade her  people to accept the proposition if India too caps its nuclear  programme.    What leverage does Washington have with New Delhi to effect  it? And why should Rao put his head on the block? America is  getting together a package containing ``incentives'' which  Talbott will spell out during his visit to India. Rao has also  been invited to Washington from 6 May to meet Clinton and  Congressmen. To ensure that Rao does not reject outright the  invitation, the Hindujas in London have been brought into the  picture.    Anticipating India's demand that China, should also cap its  nuclear programme America proposes convening a larger meeting,  including Russia and China, for arriving at some consensus. Both  India and Pakistan will be invited. It is difficult to imagine  China agreeing to any curb when it has not accepted even a  moratorium on nuclear tests.    But the Clinton administration's eyes are set on India and  Pakistan, not China. It expects that the meetings in Washington,  preceded by the process which Raphel and Talbott have set into  motion, will yield some `results'. If, despite Raphel's  offensive observations, Rao could order red carpet treatment for  her in the face of foreign office's opposition and even ask the  Home Minister, S. B. Chavan, to meet her, the Prime Minister can  be probably propitiated by the fuss America intends making  during his visit.    All this is understandable from Washington's point of view.  But the interests of New Delhi are not served by America's  moves. Whatever agreement or concession in the nuclear field is  envisaged, it should be offered directly to Islamabad. The  principle of bilateralism, which has been established through  the Simla Agreement to settle mutual differences between India  and Pakistan, should not be diluted. By giving any function to a  third party, particularly America, New Delhi may set a precedent  which may one day be used in respect of Kashmir.    Why America has been singled out is because it is clearer  than before that Washington wants to have a role in the region.  Maybe, it is anticipating China's disintegration after Deng  Xiaoping's death. Maybe, it is opposed to India emerging as a  regional power. Maybe, it has developed a vested interest in  Kashmir. Unlike the Bush administration, the Clinton  administration has different strategical considerations.    Because of these considerations, Washington's tilt towards  Islamabad is visible. For it, Pakistan is a dependable country  where the army's hold makes things far easier than those in  democratic, uncertain India. Raphel has given a peep into one  aspect of America's policies by hinting at an independent status  for the state of Jammu and Kashmir. However, America's UN  representative in 1949, Henry Austin, during the discussion on  Kashmir at the UN, said that the state's ``sovereignty'' had  passed on to India.    Washington has come a long way since. Raphel is only  annoyingly enthusiastic about-putting things across. But before  she made them public she tested them at the Carnegie Institute  on a group of American scholars working on the subcontinent. She  said that America would treat India and Pakistan at par. When a  lady scholar said that the policy reminded her of the days of  Dulles, Raphel did not contradict her.    If Rao still wants to go to America, he is at liberty to do  so. But please save us the humbug that the visit is meant to  further consolidate the relationship between India and the  United States.</p>

			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Call to snub Argentine strike ARGENTINA'S government yesterday stepped up pressure on workers to ignore a general strike called for Monday by the CGT trade union confederation. It took out full-page newspaper advertisements saying: 'The country is advancing. The November 9 general strike is a step back.' Recognising the right to strike, the government demanded the unions also recognise the 'rights of the rest of the population'. The governing Peronist party, which has close links to the union movement, said the strike had 'ulterior political ends'. President Carlos Menem promised to ensure basic services such as health, transport, energy and banking services. Previous threats by the weak and divided unions to call a general strike have failed in the face of a determined and aggressive government that has systematically eroded their privileges. The most hated of the government's measures is a decree linking wage rises to productivity increases, rather than inflation. The inflation rate now stands at 20 per cent a year, while wage increases trail far behind. However, falling real wages and government attempts to reform rigid labour laws and wrest some Dollars 5bn in welfare funds from the union leadership have galvanised them into organising the first general strike against Mr Menem's government, after staging 13 stoppages against the previous Radical government of Raul Alfonsn. Nonetheless, Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, is determined to force labour legislation through Congress, to improve industry's international competitiveness. Economists say Congress must approve the reforms by early 1993.</p>

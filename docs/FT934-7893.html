			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / House sales slow ahead of Budget POTENTIAL house purchasers are delaying purchases ahead of this month's Budget, causing a slowdown in activity in the housing market, says a survey of more than 100 estate agents in England and Wales published today, Andrew Taylor writes. The survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors says there is a shortage of properties being put up for sale. But buyers are snapping up homes when they are keenly priced. Almost 90 per cent of agents questioned last month said prices had remained unchanged over the previous three months. Only 3.7 per cent reported price rises while 8.7 per cent said prices were still falling. The institution said the Budget was casting a shadow over the market with buyers and sellers concerned that Mr Kenneth Clarke's measures might undermine confidence. Estate agents and housebuilders are concerned that Mr Clarke should not announce further reductions in mortgage tax relief. The rate of relief is due to fall from 25 per cent to 20 per cent next April.</p>

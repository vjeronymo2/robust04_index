			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "M.G.": "Defense Ministry Admits That Military </F> Expenditure Will Not Rise Over Next Three Years"]    [Excerpt] Madrid -- Secretary of State for Defense Antoni  Flos admitted in Congress yesterday that his ministry's budget  will not rise in terms of GDP over the next three years. The  defense budget currently represents 1.3 percent of GDP and,  according to a Congress resolution of July 1991, should reach 2  percent at the end of the decade. According to the figures  provided by Flos yesterday, military expenditure will rise at  approximately the same rate as GDP, which is expected to  increase by just over 1 percent this year.    The Defense Ministry official explained that this forecast  does not reflect his wishes, but is the result of the framework  budget set by the Finance Ministry for the next few years and an  argument between the two ministries in which there was "blood,  sweat, and tears." Flos stated that with these forecasts it is  "virtually impossible to carry out the Army modernization  program," which envisages overall expenditure on the replacement  of equipment of 506.408 billion pesetas in the 1995-2002 period.    During the next fiscal year, Army expenditure will total 33  billion pesetas -- virtually the same sum as this year -- 21  billion pesetas of which have already been committed. Nor will  it be possible, he added, to have the 5 billion pesetas per year  for infrastructure required by the implementation of the Master  Plan [Plan Norte] for the Army's redeployment, unless the  Defense Ministry raises additional revenue through the sale of  barracks.

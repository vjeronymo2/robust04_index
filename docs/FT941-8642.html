			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester rises to Pounds 202m Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society, the UK's sixth largest, yesterday reported a 55 per cent rise to Pounds 202m in pre-tax profits for the year to end-December. The results benefited from a sharp fall in provisions for bad and doubtful debts to Pounds 75.9m. For 1992 profits and provisions were affected by the acquisition of the Portsmouth building society in 1991. At the pre-tax level they fell to Pounds 130.6m with bad debt provisions nearly tripling to Pounds 210.7m. For the year under review, total assets rose from Pounds 16.2m to Pounds 17.7m, with Pounds 870,000 of the increase coming from the takeover of the Heart of England building society. While mortgage advances fell slightly to Pounds 2.2bn (Pounds 2.3bn), C&amp;G still increased its share of the UK mortgage market from 3.88 per cent to 4.08 per cent. The society said that without the acquisition of Heart of England there would have been a 'modest increase' in market share. Net retail inflow was Pounds 125m (Pounds 474m) but as C&amp;G's wholesale funds did not rise during the year, its non-retail funds fell to 22.8 per cent (24 per cent) as a percentage of shares and deposits. The society said that in the absence of greater mortgage demand there was no need to attract more retail funds, but that it would respond to any increase in demand. Net interest receivable and other income and charges both fell back from 1992 at Pounds 330.6m (Pounds 377.2m) and Pounds 59.5m (Pounds 60.9m) respectively. Cost/income ratio rose to 26.4 per cent(22.1 per cent) ,but is still below the sector average. Administrative expenses rose to Pounds 103.1m (Pounds 96.8m) reflecting factors such as the refurbishment of about 21 HoE branches and the opening of three new branches. Mr Andrew Longhurst, chief executive, said the society was considering opening 12 branches in the coming year, and looking to expand in the north of England, though he would expect the overall size of the branch network to remain the same. A conversion to plc status remained a possibility, he said, if continuing under the regulatory regime for societies prevented C&amp;G from competing effectively in the mortgage and retail deposit markets. He emphasised the society's possibilities for growth, despite the static nature of the housing market at present and fierce competition from banks, by increasing its share of the building societies' share of the mortgage market.</p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / International Company News: Thomson-CSF lifts Credit Lyonnais holding to 21% THOMSON-CSF, the French state-controlled defence electronics group, is to exchange its remaining share in Altus Finance, the financial group which it owns jointly with Credit Lyonnais, for an increased share in the French state-owned bank. Under the terms of the agreement announced yesterday, Credit Lyonnais will receive Thomson-CSF's 32 per cent stake in Altus, while Thomson-CSF will raise its shareholding in Credit Lyonnais from 14 per cent to 21.6 per cent. Thomson-CSF said the deal would free it from a minority shareholding and was consistent with its strategy of concentrating on core industrial activities. It said it intended to sell its shareholding in Credit Lyonnais once the bank had been privatised, estimating that this would raise about FFr10bn (Dollars 1.7bn). Credit Lyonnais is on the French government's list of 21 companies which it plans to privatise. However, no date has yet been set for the sale. The defence electronics group said the agreement with Credit Lyonnais was purely financial and not strategic. It said it would not be represented on the board of Credit Lyonnais. The deal represents the end of Thomson-CSF's participation in external treasury operations. It established a financial subsidiary to manage its foreign exchange business following the award of a Dollars 9bn missiles systems contract with Saudi Arabia in 1987. In 1989, it ceded control of the subsidiary, which then became Altus Finance, to Credit Lyonnais. Since then, Thomson-CSF has gradually reduced its stake in Altus Finance. 'Our activities have diverged,' Thomson-CSF said. 'Altus has diversified its activities into areas like property and retailing while we are an industrial company.' Altus is currently engaged in a bid for control of Fnac, the retailing group. Last year, Thomson-CSF's stake in Credit Lyonnais was one of the principal reasons for a 35 per cent decline in net profits, to FFr1.52bn as the French bank reported its first loss for 18 years. However, it does not expect the losses at the bank to continue.</p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Luggage locker row goes to EC RAANND SYSTEMS, a company based in Livingston near Edinburgh, has complained to the European Commission about alleged predatory pricing by the French company Mors in the battle for orders for left-luggage lockers in railway stations. Raannd has complained to the commission that Mors won a contract in December to supply lockers at Waverley station in Edinburgh, and at Queens Street and Central stations in Glasgow, by setting prices in a predatory manner. Raannd had offered to supply 700 lockers for about Pounds 400,000, and says Mors undercut this by 40 per cent. It is also complaining that it was undercut by Mors last August on an order from British Rail for 700 lockers at Waterloo International station in London. The complaint came to light as ScotRail, BR's Scottish division, confirmed that automated luggage lockers installed by Mors at Edinburgh Waverley were being adapted after it was found they would only accept French and Belgian coins. The problem with the coins was triggering the lockers' alarm system. Mors has about 75 per cent of the European locker market and Raannd alleges that Mors has violated article 86 of the Treaty of Rome which covers abuse of market power. Raannd says the commission has begun an investigation of the matter. The company is also 'in dialogue' with Mors over alleged infringements of Raannd's patents on its lockers. Dr Gordon Rankine, Raannd's managing director, said that after complaining to Sir Bob Reid, chairman of BR, he was advised the procedures for the bid had been implemented correctly. Nobody at Mors was available for comment yesterday.</p>

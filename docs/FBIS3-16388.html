Despite  numerous difficult to explain statements made by Russian leaders  regarding the breaking off of talks and the postponing of the  agreed-upon date for final withdrawal, Estonia decided yesterday  to accept the April date offered by Russia for the 18th round of  talks.    At the last round, held March 1-2 outside Tallinn, Russia  backed away from August 31, 1994, the agreed upon date for final  withdrawal of the 2,600 ex-Soviet troops remaining in Estonia.  In addition, Russia demanded further conditions for withdrawal  and did not propose a date for the next round.    International reaction to Russia's moves was swift and  strong, unanimously supporting Estonia's contention that Russian  troops must leave, unconditionally, by August 31. Western  reaction played an important role in Russia's current decision  to continue the talks and to abide by the withdrawal date.    Estonian negotiating team leader, Ambassador Vaeino Reinart,  began consultations in Brussels today. He will call upon the  European Union to help mediate Estonian-Russian negotiations  within the framework of the European Stability Pact.</p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Property: Idea with big backers - The urban village is gathering support UK government policy on urban development has come forward in leaps and bounds over the past two years. The most vivid symbol of the new approach is planning policy guidance note 6, issued by the Department of the Environment in July 1993 and subsequently refined by ministerial speeches. PPG6 marked a new interventionist approach after the market-led years of the 1980s. Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, has since tried to stimulate debate about how the man-made environment can be improved. The latest idea vying for the minister's attention is the urban village: mixed-use, mixed-tenure developments where people could work as well as live. The urban village movement already has friends in high places. The idea was first promoted by the Prince of Wales at the end of the 1980s. A seminar to launch a report on the economics of urban villages was held this week at St James's Palace. The campaign also has allies close to the seat of power. The report was sponsored by English Partnerships, the government agency set up to co-ordinate urban regeneration policy. Many of the tenets behind urban villages seem to be in tune with government thinking. Planning policy is already moving away from broad, single-use areas towards a more diverse approach. Urban villages might also cut down on traffic by allowing residents to work locally. But turning the urban village blueprint into reality will require more than warm words. The report makes two main policy recommendations: the DoE should issue a planning policy guidance note encouraging local authorities to designate specific sites for urban villages. Once a site was designated, the hope is that land values would be low enough to allow a private sector developer to provide all the extras of an urban village - such as community facilities - and still make a return on investment. government funding should be made available where such intervention through the planning system was not enough. In cases where urban village sites had negative development value - because they needed to be cleared or cleaned - up to 10 per cent of the total cost might have to come from the public purse. This second proposal is hardly controversial. Government funding for urban development projects has traditionally been used to 'lever in' private sector cash. Under the City Challenge programme Pounds 1 of public money typically attracts about Pounds 4 of private sector funds. Given the interest of English Partnerships in the urban villages campaign, it would be the obvious source of funding. Such investment would be in line with the agency's stated desire to use its Pounds 250m a year budget to take equity stakes rather than simply disbursing grants. Last week, English Partnerships announced an Pounds 8m investment in an urban village-style project at Barking Reach, Essex, promoted by Bellway Homes. This investment is expected to lever in private-sector funds totalling some Pounds 24m, suggesting a funding ratio of about 1:3. If changes in the planning regime allowed this ratio to be raised to 1:9, as the report suggests, urban villages would become an efficient use of scarce resources. Mr Trevor Osborne, chairman of the Urban Villages Forum and former chairman of Speyhawk, the developer which went into receivership last May, takes the argument one stage further. 'Society has to decide whether it is getting social value for money out of its current patterns of urban development,' he said. 'Areas which display urban village characteristics show lower levels of crime and deprivation.' Mr Osborne envisages up to 20 urban villages under development by 2000, at an average cost each of Pounds 10m. If government support was required for each, that would imply Pounds 1.8bn of private sector investment and Pounds 200m of public sector support. But using the planning system to promote a particular style of development is more controversial. The free-market approach was argued this week by Mr Patrick Minford, professor of applied economics at Liverpool University, at a conference run by the National Federation of Housing Associations. Although he did not say so, Mr Minford might have noted that the grand estates of London's West End admired by the urban villages movement, such as Marylebone, were built without planning intervention. The message of PPG6, though, is that this laisser faire view is no longer mainstream in government. The wider danger is that the urban village movement becomes a Trojan horse, in which volume housebuilders smuggle development into green-belt areas. The report concedes that urban villages built on edge-of-town or green-field sites would require little or no public sector financial support. Neither is it clear how many 100-200 acre inner-city sites would be suitable for urban village development.</p>

State cut the lead  to 20-10 with 41 seconds left in the quarter on a five-yard run by Todd Varn.  Shane Montgomery keyed the 77-yard, 12-play drive, hitting seven of nine passes  for 69 yards.  </P> <P> N.C. State drove to the Clemson 38-yard line on its next possession, but ACC  interception leader Robert O'Neal picked off a pass from Montgomery to end the  threat. It was the freshman's fifth interception.  </P> <P> N.C. State turned the ball over again on its next possession. Linebacker Wayne  Simmons stripped split end Chris Corders of the ball and then recovered the  fumble at the N.C.

East Carolina is 4-1-1.  </P> <P> The Hokies (3-3-1) had two chances to score within a three-minute span.

But Hebron was stopped on  fourth and one at the East Carolina five with 12:53 left.  </P> <P> South Carolina 24, West Carolina 3 -- Harold Green ran for 150 yards and a  touchdown and Mike Dingle scored twice as the 24th-ranked Gamecocks won at  Columbia, S.C.  </P> <P> Dingle, who had 63 yards rushing, gave the Gamecocks (5-1-1) a 7-0 lead late in  the second quarter.

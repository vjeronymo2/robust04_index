			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Andersen link with Binder is agreed Arthur Andersen, the UK's third-biggest accountancy firm, is to join forces with Binder Hamlyn, formerly the eighth biggest, after an agreement signed yesterday. A formal announcement is to be made on Monday. Andersen entered talks with Binder earlier this year after developing plans in secret since last October. It is understood that the group will have annual fee income of about Pounds 500m. The agreement, which marks one of the biggest consolidations in the profession for several years, will prompt a string of new international partnerships across the UK sector. Binder Hamlyn, which is expected to retain its name in the new group, will join Arthur Andersen's international grouping and leave BDO International. Stoy Hayward will take its place, leaving a vacancy at Horwath International, which will be filled by Clark Whitehill. Not all the semi-autonomous offices of Binder Hamlyn will be involved in the new group. Stoy Hayward and Grant Thornton have already linked with regional offices of Binder Hamlyn which did not wish to join the new group. Binder Hamlyn's offices in the London region, Leeds, Manchester and Newcastle are expected to join the new group. Half the total fee income for Binder Hamlyn comes from the Leeds and London offices. The move will give Andersen access to about 100 quoted companies audited by Binder. It is understood that the new group will come into operation next month. Former Binder Hamlyn offices which have not joined the group will stop using the Binder name. Regional doubts about the link emerged soon after the initial approach. A managing partner at a regional office said difficulties would occur in terms of the size and culture of the organisations.</p>

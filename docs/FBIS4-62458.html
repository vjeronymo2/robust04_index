			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the Baltic Sea Fleet Press Center in </F> Kaliningrad; date not given]    [Text] On 29 March 1994, the Latvian newspaper DIENA --  referring to an interview in the Estonian daily HOMMIKULEHT with  Juri Pihl, director general of Estonia's security police --  published an article entitled "Russian Officers Are Accused of  Trading in Radioactive Substances."    The publication includes a number of statements which need  to  be clarified as follows.    First: In February 1993, the command of the Tallinn Naval  Base, with the permission of higher authorities, concluded an  agreement with the Estonian "Bankers" firm on the disposal of  scrap metal from two decommissioned hovercraft minesweepers.  The decommissioning was carried out over two months at a dock  in Kopli harbor. Provisions of the agreement, including those  concerning payment, were fulfilled by both sides. According to  a representative of the user of these ships, there were no  radioactive substances in the units or systems of the  minesweepers. That is to say, information contained in the  above-mentioned article concerning "components with radiation  levels of 200 Roentgen per hour" does not correspond to the  facts. The command of the Tallinn Naval Base has not received  any complaints from any side with regard to this.    Second: A statement by the paper concerning a collection  point for scrap metal, which was allegedly opened on the Naval  Base under the authorization of the Tallinn garrison chief, does  not correspond to the facts, as well.    Third: The publication points out that "the background  radiation in the Mine Harbor exceeds natural radiation levels by  40 times." Obviously, this statement has its origin in the  following real fact.    In March 1994, workers on two decommissioned minesweepers in  the Mine Harbor of the Tallinn port unscreened remote-controlled  pickup units with one radioactive "Cesium-137" unit in each.  This caused a brief period of excess natural background  radiation. On 22 March, the screens of the pickup units were  reestablished; on 30 March, they were dismantled and stored in a  special depository at the Paldiski garrison. The ensuing  measurements, which were taken in the Mine Harbor by naval  specialists along with representatives of the Estonian side, did  not detect any excess levels of natural background radiation.    The distortion of real facts and the dissemination of  corresponding "sensations," which take place in various Latvian  and Estonian media, do not assist in the normal, planned process  of withdrawing Russian troops and naval forces from the  territory of these republics.

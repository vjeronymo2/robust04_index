			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Damascus, 22 May (MENA)--Former south Yemeni  President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad received a telephone call from  'Ali Salim al-Bid, secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist  Party, who urged him to return to Aden and assume the post of  the first vice president of the Democratic Republic of Yemen,  which was announced in south Yemen yesterday.    'Ali Nasir Muhammad expressed his total rejection of the  idea  of secession and asked al-Bid to change his mind about  establishing a state in south Yemen and to search for a solution  within the framework of Yemeni unity.    In a statement to the MENA correspondent in Damascus, 'Ali  Nasir Muhammad said he was ready to play a new mediation role to  solve the crisis within this framework and to return to Yemen  within 48 hours. However, the decision to secede and the  subsequent developments have prevented him from conducting this  mediation.    'Ali Nasir Muhammad warned that the secession decision will  not solve Yemen's problem but will complicate it further, lead  to a series of new conflicts, and partition Yemen into small  entities and states.

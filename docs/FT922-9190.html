			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Limited Scottish gains for Tories - Council Elections THE Conservatives made gains in Scotland at the expense of Labour, but neither they nor the Scottish National party did as well as they had hoped in elections for all the country's 53 district councils. The Tories, who had high hopes after their relative success in the general election, failed to become the largest party in Edinburgh or take control of the city council, although Labour lost overall control. But they won Kyle and Carrick district council, which is centred on Ayr, and took Perth and Kinross. However, they reached a dead heat with Labour in Stirling  - as they did in 1988  - and lost control of Bearsden and Milngavie, outside Glasgow, making a net gain of one council. The SNP became the largest party in West Lothian and in Falkirk at the expense of Labour, but failed to win Cumbernauld and Kilsyth from Labour. It ended the night with no extra councils but more councillors. In a generally low turnout, Labour  - which won 27 councils in 1988  - lost control of five districts but kept control of Aberdeen. The Liberal Democrats lost wards in some districts but strengthened control of North East Fife and took control in Annandale and Eskdale in south-west Scotland from independents.</p>

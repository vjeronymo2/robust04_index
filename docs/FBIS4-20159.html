			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ingrid Steiner: "Brugger: `Neofascists Are </F> Starting an Avalanche"]    [Text] The South Tirolean People's Party (SVP) howled in  outrage about the latest statements by the Italian neofascists  (MSI) [Movimento Sociale Italiano] in and about South Tirol.  Therefore, at the special meeting with the protective power  Austria today, Thursday, SVP Chairman Siegfried Brugger wants to  get an "assessment of the new situation in Italy" from Vienna.  Said Brugger in an interview with KURIER:    -- about the neofascists:    "Italy is the first country in West Europe to make old and  new fascists socially acceptable. A party that has never  distanced itself from fascism will participate in the  government," Burger states, seeing "reason for concern." And  when Italian MSI Chairman Fini "is permitted to call Mussolini  the greatest statesman of the 20th century, something dangerous  is going on," Brugger told KURIER. "I am afraid that the slogans  of the MSI are indeed developing in the direction that they are  aiming for."    -- on safeguarding the autonomy:    The SVP chairman sees difficult times ahead for the minority  Germans and Ladins. Therefore, together with Vienna it must be  examined "to what extent the security mechanisms of our autonomy  are internationally anchored and effective to defend our  autonomy."    -- on help from the outside:    However, Brugger also expects diplomatic pressure on Italy  --  because international treaties are involved. "If one carelessly  undermines international treaties, one starts an avalanche. And  this might also have a dangerous effect on South Tirol."</p>

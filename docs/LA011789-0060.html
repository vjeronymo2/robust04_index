			<p><P> January 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> MEXICO UNIONISTS FACE TRIAL  </P> <P> A judge ordered 46 leaders of Mexico's oil workers union to stand trial on  charges of arms smuggling and corruption, and a union official said that arrest  warrants have been issued for as many as 35 others in a further crackdown on  the powerful labor organization. Police last week arrested the 46, including  union boss Joaquin Hernandez Galicia, in a move to abolish graft in the top  ranks of the union. Judge Jose Luis Garcia Vasco denied bail to 18 of the 46  and postponed bail hearings for Hernandez Galicia and three others until later  this week. Union attorney Carlos Castro Esparza said he expects additional  arrests soon as new warrants are served.  </P></p>

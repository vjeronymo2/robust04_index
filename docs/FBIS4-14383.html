			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Dialogue Amid a New Reality"] </F>   [Text] The satisfaction and welcome expressed by the  Palestinian people's sons, both inside and outside the occupied  territories, for the recent agreement between Hamas [Islamic  Resistance Movement] and Fatah and for the launching of an  expanded dialogue between various Palestinian national forces  aimed at safeguarding the Palestinian supreme national interests  affirm that this positive development constitutes, among other  things, a response to the Palestinian street's desire to see  that unity has been restored and democracy consolidated in the  Palestinian arena. This, despite the different positions and  views in the occupied territories on the interim stage agreement.    The timing of the agreement and dialogue confirm the depth  of  the realization by the various Palestinian national forces,  whether those supporting or opposing the Oslo accord, that a new  stage has begun in the life of our Palestinian people and that  we are standing on the threshold of a new reality, which makes  it incumbent on all to shoulder their national and historic  responsibility. This, at a time when the occupied territories'  sons are getting ready to set up the first Palestinian  self-governing authority and hoping that this development will  be a prelude to ending the occupation and building an  independent Palestinian state.    From this premise, the comprehensive national dialogue  derives immense significance. This dialogue, which relies on a  firm basis of crucial common denominators linking the sons of  one people, and which is based on democratic traditions  reinforced by long years of struggle, should lead to the  enhancement of Palestinian unity and spare it the dangers of  fragmentation and infighting in the coming new stage. This  stage requires every Palestinian effort to be directed toward  construction. It also requires moving the new reality toward  consolidating the Palestinian national authority and translating  Palestinian aspirations for freedom and independence into  tangible and responsible steps leading to the realization of  this goal.    At a time when the Palestinians in general, and the occupied  territories' sons in particular, expect the current dialogue to  produce positive results that remove from the Palestinian arena  the elements of weakness and enhance unity in confronting the  new reality, we hope that the various Palestinian national  forces will translate the slogans of unity and democracy into  steps that strengthen those that have already been taken.  Moreover, we hope that the pace of this translation will not  only be in harmony with our approach to the new reality, but  will approach this reality with a firm Palestinian body, able to  confront the various developments and capable of waging the  battle of construction with the same resolve that it showed in  its long march toward freedom and independence.</p>

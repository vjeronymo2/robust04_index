			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CLIPBOARD;  </P> <P> HOW TO;  </P> <P> GUIDELINES FOR REGISTERING HISTORY  </P> <P> If Cicero was right in his observation that history illumines reality, county  residents have a way to shed their own ideas of light, and the boundaries are  far from constricting.  </P> <P> Among the more unusual landmarks included in the Orange County Historical  Commission's registry of 38 historical locations, for example, are a grove of  macadamia trees, planted by a spiritual community in Yorba Linda in 1890, and a  rusted iron cage in San Juan Capistrano, used earlier in the century to confine  outlaws captured in South County.  </P> <P> More traditional are the Peralta Adobe in Anaheim and Huntington Beach High  School, included as representations of significant building and architectural  styles. Each site is marked with a bronze plaque.  </P> <P> If you know of something you think worthy of note, the commission is willing to  hear your case. It accepts recommendations from citizens or organizations  willing to sponsor a potential addition to its registry. If the site is  accepted, the sponsor must provide renovation funding and arrange a dedication  ceremony. Obtain an application by calling (714) 834-5560. Or write to the  commission at P.O. Box 4048, Santa Ana, 92702.  </P> <P> There are, however, a few basic selection guidelines:  </P> <P> * Subject may be a structure, natural formation or significant plant, such as a  landmark tree or grove.  </P> <P> * It should relate to significant events in the county's political, cultural,  economic or social development -- for example, the railroad era, bygone  business or military activities or early agricultural trends.  </P> <P> * It can be a site once lived in or utilized by a historical personality.  </P> <P> * Structures that represent indigenous or significant architectural styles are  acceptable.  </P> <P> * Buildings representative of notable architects or builders are also  considered.  </P> <P> Source: Orange County Historical Commission  </P></p>

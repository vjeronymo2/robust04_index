			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] It is apparently getting pretty rough in the United  Nations assembly camps in Mozambique. Hundreds of soldiers from  the government side and Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance]  have been kicking their heels for months, waiting to be  demobilized. Conditions are often poor, the troops have run out  of patience with the slow progress of the operation. There has  been a string of mutinies, but the worst yet has occurred in a  Renamo camp when troops turned on one of their most senior  officers. From Maputo, Barnaby Philips reports:    [Begin Philips recording] UN and diplomatic sources told me  this morning of the most dramatic mutiny so far in the  Mozambican peace process. It occurred yesterday in a Renamo  assembly area in the northern province of Zambezia. One of  Renamo's most senior generals, Brigadier Raul Dique, was set  upon by his own men. The UN source said that Brig. Dique was  stripped, tied to a tree, and beaten in the face and stomach.  He apparently lost some teeth and his ribcage is understood to  have been badly damaged. Diplomatic sources confirmed that  Brig. Dique had been roughed up and said he was recuperating in  a UN military hospital.    In Maputo, Renamo have refused to say anything about the  incident. It is only the latest in the now almost daily riots  which are afflicting both government and Renamo assembly areas  across Mozambique. The riots are getting increasingly violent  and UN military observers in the camps are themselves becoming  the target of that violence.    All this was due to be discussed at a meeting in Maputo this  afternoon between top UN, government, and Renamo figures. The  UN will be (?arguing) that the brutal treatement handed out to  Brig. Dique will provide the necessary motivations to both sides  to speed up the mobilization process. [end recording]</p>

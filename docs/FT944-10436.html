			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / International Company News: Improved sales lift Federated to Dollars 44.3m Increased sales and improved efficiency helped Federated Department Stores, the US owner of Bloomingdale's and other department store chains, to produce a surge in net income from Dollars 20.3m to Dollars 44.3m in its third quarter to Octo-ber. The increase in earnings was exaggerated by a tax adjustment in the comparable period, but Federated said net income would still have been 26 per cent ahead if the adjustment had not taken place. Earnings a share rose to 35 cents in the quarter from 16 cents. Some of the profits increase came from an 8 per cent rise in revenues to Dollars 1.93bn. Federated opened four new stores during the period, taking the total to 235, while sales at existing stores rose by 3.4 per cent. Gross margins fell to 38.5 per cent from 39.5 per cent because Federated marked down prices to shift goods. However, the effects were outweighed by its continuing efforts to increase efficiency: operating costs were down from 33.8 per cent of sales to 31.7 per cent. In July Federated won agreement from R. H. Macy, the rival department store group, to a merger but the deal is not expected to be completed until the end of the year and is not reflected in the figures. Nordstrom, a US clothing retailer with 55 large stores, reported a 50 per cent increase in net income from Dollars 25.5m to Dollars 38.1m in the quarter to October, continuing the strong profits growth seen earlier in the year. Earnings a share increased from 31 cents to 46 cents. The company said higher sales revenues, fewer markdowns and greater control over costs were behind the increase. Revenues rose by 12 per cent to Dollars 862m, with existing stores increasing sales by 6.7 per cent and the rest coming from new stores.</p>

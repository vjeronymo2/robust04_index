			<p>BFN     [Text] Neither the intervention of the PMDB [Brazilian  Democratic Movement Party] leadership, nor an appeal to  congressional corporatism could free Deputy Ibsen Pinheiro from  being dismissed by the Chamber of Deputies.    During a 12-hour session, former Chamber of Deputies  President Pinheiro was stripped of his congressional mandate by  a vote of 296 to 139; 24 lawmakers abstained.    The Federal Supreme Court [STF] turned down a request for a  court injunction filed by Pinheiro, who wanted to suspend his  trial at the Chamber of Deputies.    Justice Carlos Mario Veloso reported at his office that the  investigations requested by Pinheiro could be conducted only  during the trial.    Ibsen Pinheiro also wanted the STF to annul a decision by  the  Constitution and Justice Commission, which recommended his  dismissal.</p>

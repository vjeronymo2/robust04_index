			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (9): Weak figures leave New York investors little to look forward to - Equities REMEMBER THE double-dip? Euphoria in the wake of the Gulf war victory in 1991 briefly spurred economic activity across the US, only for stagnation to set in soon after. Now, there is talk of a triple-dip, with a few people on Wall Street warning that the US economy could be going into reverse for the third time in two and a half years. The triple-dippers are a trifle over-pessimistic, but the lacklustre nature of the recovery has been worrying. Gross domestic product grew by 2.7 per cent in the first quarter, but in the wake of recent poor economic numbers, GDP growth in the second quarter will probably be below 2 per cent. This slowdown in economic activity has put a dampener on stock market sentiment. During the second quarter, share prices made little ground. As of the penultimate day of June, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had advanced just 2.6 per cent to 3,319.86, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 had risen 1.3 per cent to 408.91. Investors, meanwhile, lost faith in growth stocks, which helps explain why the Nasdaq composite index, undermined by big falls in once-high flying biotech and healthcare companies, dropped 7.5 per cent during the three months to 558.80. The quarter did not start as gloomily as it ended. April was marked by some surprisingly good three-monthly corporate earnings - even Ford and General Motors managed to post a profit - and a modest easing of monetary policy by the Federal Resere. This, plus some encouraging numbers on retail sales and the housing market during May, contributed to a slow, if uneven, rise in share values. Cyclical stocks - those most likely to benefit from a recovery  -attracted the most demand. Yet there were hiccups along the way, including the riots in Los Angeles, which showed that the recovery was not reaching into the nation's cities, and the bankruptcy of Olympia &amp; York (O&amp;Y), the Canadian property developer and a big borrower from New York banks. By the start of June, the Dow had reached 3,400. That, however, proved to be the limit of the market's achievements. The warning signs of a correction had already been evident in the poor performance of the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq composite, which lagged behind the Dow throughout the quarter - proof that confidence in the market was not broadly spread. Over the next few weeks, the Dow dropped more than 100 points, as concern about the economy grew in the wake of bad news on retail sales and employment. Worst of all, the recovery in the housing market appeared to have stalled, the result of a rise in mortgage rates during the quarter. By the end of June, investors had little to look forward to, although weak economic figures had bolstered hopes that the Fed might lower interest rates. With election politics sowing uncertainty, economic growth slowing, and no immediate interest rate cut in sight, the outlook for share prices as the third quarter opened was none too bright. Canada mimicked the US. Its economic recovery was sluggish, and O&amp;Y did little to help sentiment, leaving Canadian investors hoping the US Fed would ease policy, paving the way for lower Canadian rates. During the quarter the Toronto Stock Exchange 300 composite index fell by 1 per cent. Mexico suffered a big reversal, not totally unexpected given the dramatic nature of the market's rally. The Bolsa index fell by 14.6 per cent in the April-to-June period. Investors were concerned about the still-unsigned North American Free Trade Agreement, the weak world economy, and the possibility that Mexican unions might sell their big stake in telecommunications giant Telmex.</p>

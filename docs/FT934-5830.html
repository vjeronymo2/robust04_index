			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Food and Drink: Bourbon? Take it out of Kentucky - Giles MacDonogh raises hell in bluegrass country Were I to play devil's advocate in Louisville, Kentucky - a risky thing to do - they would almost certainly have me run out of town because I would suggest two important changes in the way Bourbon whiskey is made. Firstly, I would abolish the rule that the spirit may only be matured in new white oak casks. Secondly, I would shift production several hundred miles to the north, to the Canadian border, a place cool enough to allow the whiskey to mature in peace. Bourbon is a prisoner of its own packaging: new white oak, charcoal filters, and Kentucky. In the last century, and the first few years of this, it was virtually indistinguishable from 'white dog' or moonshine. This coarse, backwoodsman's dram was derailed by Prohibition. There was no time between the repeal of the Volstead Amendment and the outbreak of the second world war to build up mature stocks of Bourbon which means that the earliest properly made whiskies were bottled during the second world war or just after. I was fortunate enough to sample one of these at United Distillers' big distillery complex in the suburbs of Louisville. When Bourbon emerged from its big sleep, it did so with all the gimickry of new oak and indications of great age. In reality, however, age is not a good sign when it comes to Bourbon. The sun burns brightly in the long Kentucky summers and the whiskey is fairly grilled in the gaunt, corrugated iron silos which are a distinctive feature of the landscape. The spirits lodged under the rooftops lose volume at an alarming rate. It has long been held true that the best Bourbon is the 'middle cut', barrels housed half-way up the multi-storey warehouse, where they are best protected from the heat. As the whiskey reduces in cask it absorbs more and more of the flavours and tannins in the white oak casks. At around six to eight years it achieves a sort of balance where it is not too oaky or peppery. When the cask and whiskey flavours have agreed to some sort of marriage it makes the Bourbon good to drink. Left for longer it gets forbiddingly peppery and woody. The 28-year-old Bourbon I sampled at the independent Heaven Hill distillery was like chewing on a mouthful of splinters. Another drawback, when it comes to Bourbon, is an obsession with filtering. If one were to believe the contents of the current advertising campaign for the Tennessee whiskey, Jack Daniels, the stuff would be so hygienically filtered that it would be indistinguishable from cask-aged vodka. Filtering takes the goodness out of all alcoholic drinks. Booker Noe is aware of this and this is why his very special whiskey - Booker's - is unfiltered. Booker Noe is the grandson of Jim Beam, one of the distillers who pioneered the rebirth of Bourbon after Prohibition. Booker was chief distiller at Jim Beam until recently. Now his son, Fred, is being groomed for the job. Fred has an agreeable frankness when it comes to Bourbon. As we went through the distillery I pointed to the heavy filtering process going on before bottling: 'That's why daddy's so fond of his Bourbon]' he said. The filtering was introduced in the 1980s. 'The old boys say the whiskey don't taste like it used to. We don't make it like we used to,' he adds candidly. Booker Noe is one of Kentucky's living legends; a colossus of a man who lives in patriarchal style surrounded by his family. His job is to select the very best whiskies from the Jim Beam distillery which are issued as single-cask Bourbons. Booker's is issued at cask strength in very limited quantities and sells in the US at around Dollars 45 (Pounds 30.20) a bottle. It is wonderfully complex for a Bourbon; an eight-year-old whiskey from the middle of the warehouse with tremendous depth of flavour Booker also selects the other cask-release Bourbons for Jim Beam: Basil Hayden, Baker's and Nob Creek. Jim Beam is not the only Bourbon distillery to issue single-cask Bourbons. Ancient Age has had a notable success with Blantons and their rare (I was unable to put my hands on a bottle) Rock Hill Farms label is consistently cited as one of the best on the market. None of these single-cask Bourbons is widely available in Britain. The best you'll find here is a high strength whiskey such as Wild Turkey 101 (50.5 per cent), or Makers Mark from Kentucky's most picturesque (almost 'boutique') distillery in Loretto. The higher strength works better for Bourbon as the flavours appear to marry up better. Makers Mark is a Bourbon which uses a small percentage of wheat together with the predominant corn and malt in its mash tub (another is Rebel Yell). This may well be responsible for the impressive, lemony length of its taste on the palate. What is more the flavour of the whiskey seems to win out over the cask for once; but then, I have probably said enough. Makers Mark is available from Harrods (071-730-1234) or Selfridges (071-629-1234) priced around Pounds 21. Harrods also sells the Wild Turkey 101 at Pounds 22.25.</p>

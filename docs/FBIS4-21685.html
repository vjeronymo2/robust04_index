			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 29 (YONHAP) -- Russia would support a  United Nations Security Council resolution calling on North  Korea to accept nuclear inspections, while seeking an  international meeting to discuss the issue attended by South and  North Korea, the United States, Japan, Russia, China, the United  Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], Radio  Moscow reported Monday.    According to NAEWOE PRESS, Seoul's official monitor of  communist countries' news media, the radio said, "Moscow would  support a UN Security Council resolution calling for North Korea  to observe its obligations to the IAEA under the framework of  the nuclear non- proliferation treaty."    Moreover, Russia thinks that neighboring countries' efforts  to solve the problem are not enough so it will try to hold an  international meeting of delegates from South and North Korea,  Japan, Russia, China, the United States, the UN  secretary-general and the IAEA director-general, the radio said.    Radio Moscow, citing the scheduled deployment of Patriot  missiles in South Korea and Pyongyang's objections to the move,  said, "the tension on the Korean peninsula is worsening and  under thses circumstances, Russia's idea on holding an  international meeting is useful and pressing."</p>

			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HER WORLD: A PICNIC ADDS TASTE TO VISUAL FEASTS  </P> <P> It wasn't always called the White Tower, that 100-foot-high bulwark at the  heart of the Tower of London. The name took hold only in 1241, when Henry III  whitewashed the original stones, which had come from Kent and Caen back in 1077  at the order of William the Conqueror.  </P> <P> Or so I am told.  </P> <P> What I know for sure is that the tower is a formidable backdrop for a picnic.  </P> <P> I sat there, on a bench by the River Thames, and unwrapped the foil from a  jacket potato that I'd bought from a cart beside Tower Bridge.  </P> <P> The vendor offered dozens of toppings, including chili and onions; I asked for  grated cheddar cheese and fresh chives. The potato was crisp on the outside,  flaky on the inside and so hot that the golden cheese melted.  </P> <P> A beefeater guard walked by on his break. The Crown Jewels were locked up  behind. Pink-cheeked youngsters toddled after pigeons. Nannies toddled after  youngsters. The moat was wide and green.  </P> <P> There was no mistaking where I was.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reinforcing Reality  </P> <P> A picnic, somehow, is like pinching yourself to prove you are there. It slows  you down just enough to reinforce reality. It adds the sense of taste to visual  wonders. It places you on the scene, instead of isolating you behind bus  windows or the perspiring glass of an air-conditioned restaurant.  </P> <P> Whether in city or country, a picnic allows the day to flow on, its mood and  rhythm unbroken by the search for an eatery or a long wait for service.  </P> <P> For me a picnic menu is incidental, though not unimportant. It is the setting  that glimmers long after the cheese and the bread have disappeared.  </P> <P> Spontaneous picnics are best. They are a sudden gift to yourself and your  friends.  </P> <P> I have skipped a midday meal -- even a prepaid one -- to stay outside on a  brisk, sunny Sunday in Stockholm's Old Town.  </P> <P> I have excused myself from a scheduled tour lunch in Budapest to catch a snack  at the city zoo.  </P> <P> I have pulled my rental car off lonely roads during rain squalls in Scotland  and picnicked behind locked doors -- while being splendidly frightened by BBC  mystery tales on the radio.  </P> <P> One summer I left Dubrovnik by van with six friends, driving up the ragged  Dalmatian coast of Yugoslavia. The day was fresh and clear; fist-shaped clouds  boxed their way across a blue horizon.  </P> <P> Split was our destination, but unanimous was our vote to skip a hotel dining  room scene at noon. Our time was too short; our diets had been too heavy. We  paused at a village market -- not far from Hvar -- and pointed to olives,  cheese, bread, wine and figs. With Swiss Army knives at the ready, we picnicked  amid white boulders on a cliff high above the Adriatic.  </P> <P> One of my favorite picnics happened because of a funeral in the Portuguese  village of Sintra. The procession filled the narrow street with mourners who  walked behind a canary-yellow Ford Cabriolet that had been made into a hearse  with tassels and filigree.  </P> <P> We could not move our car from the curb. So we watched for a while and then  began buying fresh bread, slabs of Serpa and Flamenco cheese and a bottle of  vinho verde in its tall green bottle.  </P> <P> By then the procession had passed, and we drove into the countryside to a field  crimson with poppies. We sprawled beneath groaning white windmills and drank a  toast to life.  </P> <P> The next day, near Obidos, we took the empty bottle into a country store for a  refill. The proprietor walked past barrels of white wine and rose, then tapped  the vinho verde. From a drawer of odd corks he cut one to fit and pushed it  into the bottle.  </P> <P> Another magical time was in a glade above the walled village of Riquewihr south  of Strasbourg. We had been traveling by barge on the canals of Alsace and  Lorraine; it felt good to commune with the earth.  </P> <P> The young French chef sent us off with hampers of melons, bean salad, quiche  Lorraine, chocolate tarts and Alsatian wines. But for a gathering of rain  clouds, we might have stayed until dark.  </P> <P> Some of the ingredients of a picnic in France are present in French Polynesia.  Rather than dine at a hotel on the island of Moorea we stopped at a roadside  market for fresh baguettes, goat cheese with herbs, taro chips and Tahitian  Hinano beer.  </P> <P> Then, traveling slowly by motor scooter, we began searching for a perfect  beach. It was not far away, a shallow cup of white sand that faced the lagoon  and was shaded by Australian pines. A tree stump would serve as a table. A  small stone bench would allow us to sit above the sand.  </P> <P> As we left, I looked for a sign so that I could identify this romantic place. A  small placard was tacked to a tree: "Propriete Prive. Tabu."  </P> <P> I respect private property as much as I love picnics, so I am glad I ate first  and read later.  </P></p>

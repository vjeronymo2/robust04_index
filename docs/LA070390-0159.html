			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ARF AND OINK;  </P> <P> DOG TO LIVE HIGH ON HOG; HOG TOO  </P> <P> A 150-pound gray-rumped hog and a German shepherd named Calamity Jane will be  taken care of for the rest of their lives after inheriting part of a  $600,000-plus estate left by Margo Lamp of Davenport, who died in February at  81.  </P> <P> "I don't think it's strange at all," said Susan Halberstadt of the American  Humane Assn. in Denver.  </P> <P> "It's a very special bond that exists between people and their animals."  </P> <P> Lamp willed the bulk of her estate to the Scott County Humane Society but set  aside money for her pet dog and her hog, Mr. Pig. She had no close relatives  and left $1,000 to a distant cousin and $1,000 to a friend, said her lawyer,  George Goebel, who doesn't think her will will be contested.  </P></p>

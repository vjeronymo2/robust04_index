			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article:"Disbanding of Militiamen"] </F>   [Text] The UN Operations in Mozambique began the process of  disbanding private militiamen yesterday, collecting arms from  these detachments in some industrial areas of the city of  Maputo. The action is within the framework of disbanding  irregular forces within the framework of the General Peace  Accord.    A letter sent to our news desk a few hours later questions  how one would now guarantee that warehouses suppling Maputo  residents are protected.    The reply is not simple. The police corps cannot be  everywhere and they do not have such specific missions as  guarding shops and warehouses.    The solution seems to be for residents, businessmen and  entities to use private security companies which are growing  like mushrooms in the city, with means that make the Republic of  Mozambique Police jealous. A militiaman was content to receive  100,000 meticals, the private security companies vary between  250 and 1,000 contos monthly per agent. Part of the amount will  end up being paid by the consumers.    Who will benefit from the business? Those who saw the  opportunity and put in action the appropriate mechanisms, namely  the new businessmen linked to Mozambique's defense and security  apparatus.</p>

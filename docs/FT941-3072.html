			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / International Company News: Top Danish insurer back in the black Codan, which last year became Denmark's largest general insurance company with the takeover of Hafnia, made a net profit of DKr815m (Dollars 125.4m) in 1993, compared with a DKr74m loss in 1992. Hafnia collapsed in 1992 after an unsuccessful attempt, with Norway's Uni Storebrand, to mount a bid for Skandia, the Swedish insurance group. Codan is controlled by the UK's Sun Alliance. The Hafnia acquisition is reflected by a rise in Codan's premium income, from DKr2.09bn to DKr6.95bn last year. The figure includes both general insurance and life assurance. The group's total assets rose to DKr55.34bn from DKr15.32bn. Codan said the overall result for 1993 was acceptable, but that the result for general insurance was 'unsatisfactory'.</p>

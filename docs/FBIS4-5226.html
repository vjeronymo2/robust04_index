			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- The No. 1 opposition  Liberal Democratic Party vowed Friday [8 April] to topple the  current ruling coalition of Prime Minister Horihiro Hosokawa and  establish a new coalition government led by itself.    "The Liberal Democratic Party is determined, as a  responsible  party, to act with unity and solidarity to establish a  government that can meet public expectations," LDP President  Yohei Kono said in a prepared statement.    "Japan now faces a mountain of problems that cannot be  solved  by the current ruling coalition consisting of political parties  with conflicting policies," Kono said.    He made the remarks following emergency meetings of the  LDP's  top five executives and then of former prime ministers at the  very moment when coalition partners were moving to pick a  successor to Hosokawa from among their ranks.    In a related development, Kono quickly persuaded former  Deputy Prime Minister Michio Watanabe not to take any action  that might trigger an intraparty schism, LDP officials said.    Instead, the two agreed to act in solidarity to deal with  developments in the political community following the imminent  demise of the Hosokawa administration, they said.    Watanabe, a former foreign minister, has been deemed one of  the most promising candidates to succeed Hosokawa if he would  break with the LDP and opt to form an alliance with the ruling  parties.    Minutes after Hosokawa expressed his intention to step down,  Watanabe, chief of the LDP's second-largest faction, suggested  he is ready to form an alliance with the ruling coalition.    "Japan is in a crisis," he said. "We should join forces with  people that have the same ideas to surmount the crisis."    However, former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone moved  quickly to block a possible second breakup of the LDP, which  suffered defections by dozens of legislators last June.    "Do not take action at this moment," Nakasone was quoted by  party officials as telling Watanabe. "Adopt a wait-and-see  attitude with steadfast confidence."    Meanwhile, the LDP's top five executives decided to create a  new administration free from payoff scandals if the LDP once  again sweeps to power, the officials said.    The LDP was stripped of its 38-year lock on power last  summer  amid public outrage over a string of bribery scandals, one of  which seemed to demonstrate the party executives' link with  gangsters.    The executives also decided not to allow the ruling  coalition  to pick a new premier from among their own ranks, while closely  monitoring moves to be taken by the ruling parties, they said.</p>

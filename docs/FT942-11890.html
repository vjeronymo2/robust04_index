			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Hyundai chief retires in attempt to ease tension Mr Chung Ju-yung, founder and honorary chairman of the Hyundai conglomerate, said yesterday he would retire from the management of South Korea's largest business group. His departure is meant to ease tensions between Hyundai and the government, which has discriminated against the group since Mr Chung unsuccessfully stood against President Kim Young-sam in the 1992 election. Since the election, Hyundai has not received low-interest industrial loans from the state-run Korea Development Bank and has been restricted in raising capital abroad. Share prices for Hyundai companies rose in expectation that the government would resume financing to the group. But some government officials expressed scepticism that Mr Chung would actually withdraw from Hyundai's management and retire to live on his remote farming estate. They noted he would remain as honorary chairman and continue to provide advice to his brother, Mr Chung Se-yung, the group's chairman. The retirement announcement coincides with a legal appeal to overturn Mr Chung Ju-yung's conviction for illegally financing his presidential campaign with corporate funds. Mr Chung received a suspended jail sentence last October and is awaiting a second trial to review the conviction. Mr Chung severed ties with his political group, the United People's party, last year and vowed to stay out of politics in an attempt to appease the government.</p>

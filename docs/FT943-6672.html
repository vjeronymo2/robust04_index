			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: US economic data fuel upsurge in UK equities - Market report The London stockmarket rounded off a week of big gains with a flourish, as international bonds surged higher in the wake of a much smaller-than-expected upward revision of US gross domestic product in the second quarter. The news was widely interpreted in international markets as diminishing the chances of another increase in US interest rates, and triggered big gains in US bonds which in turn unleashed a burst of buying on Wall Street. The Dow Jones Average was up more than 50 points up shortly after London closed for business. The FT-SE 100 Index, which burst through the 3,200 level mid-week after numerous abortive attempts recently, ended the day 30.9 higher at 3,265.1, its highest closing level since mid-March and a rise of 70.7, or 2.2 per cent on the week. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which has tended to lag behind the senior index recently, in spite of the inclusion of many of the regional electricity stocks, underperformed again, posting a gain of only 17.6 at 3,807.0. Over the week the latter index has gained 53.1, or 1.4 per cent. The burst of buying interest in London during the afternoon was in marked contrast to that of the morning session, when share prices were marked down and subsequently drifted easier in the wake of the latest monthly survey of distributive trades by the Confederation of British Industry. The survey suggested that UK interest rates would reach 6.25 per cent by the middle of 1995 and highlighted increasing upward pressures on prices of manufactured goods. Worries about the inflationary impact and the interest rate forecast from the survey saw the FT-SE 100 down 15.9 at the day's low point, but the index never looked like challenging the 3,200 level. A poor early showing by bonds markets also proved a drag on share prices. The picture began to change in mid-morning when dealers reported two substantial buy programmes in the equity market, one said to have been carried out by Hoare Govett and the other by James Capel. These uncovered a number of short positions among the marketmakers who lifted prices in an attempt to encourage sellers. Very little stock came into the market, however. By midday, the 100 index was in positive territory and starting to accelerate, when the US GDP news was made known. The 0.1 per cent upward revision in US GDP to 3.8 per cent, against market forecasts in excess of 4 per cent, transformed sentiment across the globe and was the second piece of good news from the US this week. On Wednesday, US durable goods orders in July were shown as falling 4.5 per cent, against expectations of a small rise, indicating a marked slowing in the US economy. With the FT-SE future being chased sharply higher and eventually closing with a 16-point premium to fair value, the cash market leapt ahead as marketmakers began to bid aggressively for stock. Dealers expect another surge of buying in London next week from institutions that have missed the recent sharp upward in share prices. 'We could be looking at 3,400 in very short order,' said one leading marketmaker. One disappointing element of the market's rise was the relatively low level of turnover. The day's volume came out at 584.9m shares, a far cry from Thursday's 843.5m, and Wednesday's 701.6m. The value of customer business on Thursday was at just under Pounds 2bn, the highest for many weeks. Insurances were again heavily bought, with analysts still pointing to the sector's underperformance. Telecoms were also in demand. The regional electricity stocks continued to post big gains and are expected to continue to respond to domestic and overseas buying interest - which many expect to lift prices to a sector average of 950p.</p>

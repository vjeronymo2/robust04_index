			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / UN pledge on sending troops to Bosnia THE plan to despatch 14,000 United Nations peacekeeping troops to Croatia will proceed despite growing ethnic turmoil in neighbouring Bosnia-Hercegovina, Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN special envoy said yesterday. Speaking in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia, Mr Vance appealed to the leaders of the three main national groups - Moslems, Serbs and Croats - for restraint to avert open conflict in the central republic. Moslem and Serb militants earlier this week put up roadblocks in and around Sarajevo, designated as the UN headquarters. This raised fears of an eruption of violence which might jeopardise the deployment of the peacekeepers. The commander and senior aides of the UN force arrive in Yugoslavia this weekend to prepare for the despatch of the troops, from 31 countries, over the next month. City officials believe that the 700 troops to be stationed in the Bosnian capital will encourage stability in the republic. The peacekeeping operation is due to last at least a year. The European Commission said yesterday it would provide 1,500 tonnes of wheat flour to displaced people in Bosnia, Reuter reports from Brussels. It said it would transport 200 tonnes of flour a day to the Yugoslav republic, with distribution managed by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the local Red Cross.</p>

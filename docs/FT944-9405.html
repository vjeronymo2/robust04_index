			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Brussels to ratify deal by Christmas The European Union expects to ratify the Uruguay Round trade accords 'before Christmas', a senior EU trade official said yesterday. The official, who was in Geneva for a meeting of the Quad group of leading traders, said the other Quad members - the US, Japan and Canada - planned to ratify the accords before the Uruguay Round implementation conference on December 8. He forecast that most EU member states would ratify by the time of the implementation conference, which is expected to set a January 1 1995 date for the Uruguay Round and the World Trade Organisation, that will police the accords, to become effective. But he said all 12 nations might not complete national procedures until EU foreign ministers met on December 19-20. The EU itself would then be in a position to ratify. The official said that the EU, Japan and Canada favoured a limited transition period during which the WTO and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) would operate in parallel. The US has already said it intends to pull out of Gatt as soon as possible after the WTO comes into force, but the EU official said he saw 'no major difficulty' with a short transition of perhaps one year. Of the 125 participants in the Round, only about 80 are likely to have ratified the trade accords by January 1. Japanese legislators said earlier this month that Tokyo was likely to ratify the pact during its current parliamentary session ending on December 3, but might postpone diplomatic steps to seal the pact due to delays in the US and Europe. Brussels also remains confident that its candidate for WTO director-general, Mr Renato Ruggiero of Italy, will be chosen by next month.</p>

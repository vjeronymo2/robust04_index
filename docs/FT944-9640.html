			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Raw materials push prices up A surge in the price of the raw materials used in the plastics sector forced plastics manufacturers to raise their prices last month, the Central Statistical Office said yesterday. Meanwhile, the chemicals sector and the pulp, paper and publishing sector also reported significant rises in the cost of their raw materials. However, the cost of coffee and metals fell back last month, following the surge in these commodity prices earlier this year. Overall, the CSO said output prices for all manufacturing sectors rose by 0.1 per cent in October, compared with September, and by 2.3 per cent in the year to October. This yearly rise was considerably lower than the growth in raw material costs, suggesting many manufacturers are still forced to absorb input price increases themselves. Input prices rose by 6.9 per cent in the year to October, and by 0.4 per cent between September and October. Nevertheless, the breakdown of the data painted a mixed picture of the underlying inflationary pressures, with some manufacturing sectors continuing to hold down their prices, while others are now passing recent rises in raw materials costs on to their customers. Output prices in the rubber and plastics sector, for example, rose by 1.7 per cent between September and October, and by 2.7 per cent in the three months to October. The CSO said several large plastics manufacturers reported that these price rises had been forced on them by rising raw materials costs, which grew by 7.7 per cent between July and October. The cost of raw materials in the chemicals sector also rose 1.2 per cent last month. Some of this rise was passed on to customers, with output prices growing by 0.7 per cent in the month. Meanwhile publishing, paper and pulp input prices rose by 1.2 per cent in the month, while output prices grew by 0.6 per cent. These rises were partly offset by the fall in some commodity prices. Coffee costs, for example,fell by 5 per cent between September and October. However, this followed a dramatic surge in coffee prices earlier this year, with coffee costs still three times higher than last October. The monthly drop in coffee prices caused imported food costs to fall by 2.3 per cent in the month, although prices still stand 24 per cent higher than last October. Metal input prices fell by 1 per cent on the month, due to lower gold and silver prices. However, this drop was not enough to offset the impact of sharp metal price rises earlier this year, with metal costs standing 15.9 per cent higher than a year ago.</p>

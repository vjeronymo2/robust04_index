			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Iraq sends oil prices tumbling Iraq's announcement last night that it might negotiate with the United Nations over a one time only sale of Dollars 1.6bn worth of oil sent prices tumbling in late London trading. The setback came at the end of a day in which prices had recovered some of the ground lost after last week's meeting of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The price of the benchmark Brent Blend fell back to Dollars 14.20 after having climbed at one stage above Dollars 14.60 a barrel. On Monday prices briefly fell below the psychological barrier of Dollars 14 as traders reacted to Opec's decision not to cut output to prop up prices. Iraq has consistently rejected UN offers to organise a one-off sale because it would have no control over the revenues. They would be used to buy humanitarian relief supplies for Iraqis as well as compensate some of the victims of the 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The earlier sharp move upwards in prices was stimulated by reports that Russia would reduce some exports because of heavy domestic demand caused by an early cold snap. Other developments, however, pointed to a continuing bearish trend. Statistics from the American Petroleum Institute were expected to show a rise in US stocks of crude oil and petroleum products. Dr Alirio Parra, the Venezuelan oil minister yesterday repeated his position that it would take several more days for the markets to appreciate Opec's decision. But Nigerian minister Mr Don Etiebet said Opec might 'have to review the situation as soon as possible'.  ----------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Monday's close)  -----------------------------------                            tonnes  ----------------------------------- Aluminium        +8,575 to 2,391,550 Aluminium alloy     +40 to    49,200 Copper           +4,525 to   590,500 Lead               -575 to   298,750 Nickel             +456 to   118,944 Zinc             +6,175 to   864,525 Tin                 -50 to    18,995  -----------------------------------</p>

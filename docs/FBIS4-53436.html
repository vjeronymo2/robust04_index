			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 19 KYODO -- Nippon Steel Corp. and  Kawasaki Steel Corp. may file an appeal with the U.S. Court of  International Trade, complaining that they have caused no damage  to the steel market in the United States, officials of the  companies said Thursday [19 May].    Such a move would be in response to a ruling by the U.S.  International Trade Commission (ITC) that the Japanese  steelmakers are selling certain steel products in the U.S. at  unfairly low prices.    A Nippon Steel official said, "Our company has shipped only  special steel which is not manufactured by U.S. makers. The  ITC's final decision is beyond our understanding."    Kawasaki Steel said ITC's decision will damage U.S.  companies  which have steadily imported steel products from Japan.    The company commented that if such unreasonable antidumping  actions are frequently taken, it will damage the mutual goal of  maintaining long-term global stability in steel trade.</p>

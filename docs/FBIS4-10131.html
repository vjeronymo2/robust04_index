			<p>BFN     [Text] Montevideo, 6 Apr (EFE)--Cuban Foreign Minister  Roberto Robaina, who is making an official visit to Uruguay  within the framework of a Latin American trip, said Cuba is  willing to continue its economic opening in order to integrate  with the current world, but it will not modify its "sacred"  political system.    Political freedom in Cuba is conditioned by external  pressure, Robaina told the media when he referred to the trade  blockade the United States imposed more than 30 years ago;  "therefore, today there is no need for political unity."    Regarding the economic opening, the foreign minister  indicated there are already 100 important international  enterprises with investments in Cuba, but he stated that he  could not reveal their names because their enterprises in other  countries might suffer U.S. pressure.    Regarding President Bill Clinton's government, he said: "It  has less aggressive language (regarding the Cuban regime) but  the blockade has increased."    Regarding President Fidel Castro's stay in power (for 35  years now), the foreign minister stressed that the president "is  not in power because he wants to hold it nor does he want to  perpetuate himself in power: The most important thing is not his  physical presence, but the continuity of the plan" that he  embodies.    Asked about succession, Robaina explained that Raul Castro,  the Armed Forces minister and Fidel's brother, has been  designated, but he added that "under new circumstances, new  names emerge," although he made it clear that he himself "is not  in line" for that task.    Robaina also commented on the accusations against his  government regarding human rights violations, which he considers  "to be a highly manipulated, discriminatory, selective, and  politicized topic," and he denied that such cases occur in his  country.    "My country disagrees with the entry (into Cuba) of those  who  wish to impose conditions" regarding human rights, Robaina said,  when he was asked why his government has never allowed an in  situ inspection by UN or Latin American Inter-Parliamentary  Union members.    Montevideo media reports today that Uruguayan Foreign  Minister Sergio Abreu suggested to Robaina "the desire (of the  Uruguayan Government) that human rights be respected in that  country and that a multiparty democracy be established."    During the meetings with President Luis Alberto Lacalle and  Abreu, the Uruguayan Government reiterated these petitions for a  political opening, according to sources.    Robaina arrived on 4 April in Montevideo and today he  concludes his official visit to Uruguay, where he will remain  for two more days on a private visit. He then will travel to  Peru, Argentina, and Paraguay to explain the Cuban economic  opening to the respective governments and request support  against the blockade.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Baghdad Republic of Iraq Radio Network  in Arabic at 2007 GMT on 23 April, as part of its scheduled 2000  GMT newscast, carries a 24-minute recording of the "text" of a  speech delivered by Iraqi President Saddam Husayn when he  received a delegation from the al-Ta'mim Governorate comprised  of tribal chieftains, notables, and clergymen of various  denominations, who pronounced the "oath of total allegiance" to  the Iraqi leader, reiterating their loyalty and allegiance to  "the people's loved one and the architect of modern Iraq," and  underscoring their willingness to sacrifices their lives, and  all that is dear in defense of Iraq and its unity and  sovereignty.    President Saddam Husayn begins his speech by saluting the  delegation members, saying: "I do not want to address the  recent past," but notes that "foreigners" want to make sure that  no other nations become powerful. He says they "do not want to  see a hill or a mountaintop on the earth they are treading," but  does not elaborate. He begins to speak about the past in general  terms, and recognizes the "dear sacrifices" the Iraqis offered  in this past. He likens the history of nations to that of men.  He argues that the history of a nation documents the hardships  they undergo.    Elaborating on this, Saddam addresses the al-Ta'mim  delegation, saying: "The standing of your people and state is  commensurate with the magnitude of the sacrifices they make in  defense of right and justice. We have repeatedly said that we  do not deem ourselves superior to anybody on the globe, given  our age-old and rich traditions, and our true Islamic religion,  which holds all human beings equal in their human worth.  However, if anybody deems himself superior to us, we become  dutybound to rectify such a transgression. This has been our  situation from the outset, and will remain so. We do not  transgress against anybody. But, whoever transgresses against  us must calculate the consequences. You have long pledged to  vindicate Karkuk. The attendees are all noble figures  representing various denominations, faiths, ethnic groups, and  tribes. You are all the sons of a single people. Karkuk is  your city, just as Baghdad is yours. Of course, Karkuk is also  special. Evildoers, and those benefiting from evil, be they  near or far, are well aware that evil cannot be entrenched, and  thus become threatening unless Karkuk turns evil. This is an  established fact of which we were well aware before 1968, when  the revolution took place. That is why we place Karkuk on an  equal footing with al-'Azamiyah and al-Karkh. The law enforced  in al-'Azamiyah and al- Karkh will also be enforced in Karkuk.  There can be no other law." [applause]    Saddam notes the experiences Karkuk has gone through at the  hands of "unrestrained outlaws," and underscores the need for  people to learn from past lessons. He urges the delegation  members to view themselves as a close-knit family, as "sons of a  single country." He adds: "You have to deem the wrongdoers  pardoned by the state as part of you. This should remain the  case unless they remind you of their old mischief. Then, you  must punish them for the old and new mischief that they carried  out. Your state cherishes a host of habits, of which you are  well aware. These habits reflect the values you cherish and the  principles you uphold."    Saddam preaches tolerance among residents of all Iraqi  governorates. If an Iraqi hailing from Baghdad wants to settle  in al-Ta'mim, he must cherish the traditions and values the  al-Ta'mim residents treasure. But if an Iraqi means mischief,  he must be confronted firmly, Saddam argues. He says that the  true Iraqi identity is manifested in "good citizenship and  patriotism."    Iraqis, Saddam argues, should respect the views of the  majority of the people. Saddam acknowledges the possible  emergence of differing views on national issues, particularly  with regard to economy. However, he states that there can be no  various interpretations when patriotic sentiments are at stake.  He adds that whoever chooses to abandon his patriotic sentiments  cannot be called an Iraqi. He goes on to say that the Iraqi  state, just like Iraqi tribes, cherishes certain values, and  detests others. Freedom, he argues, cannot allow a person to  engage in mischief against neighbors.    Saddam urges his audience to enlighten their children, sons,  and daughters about the past, and about the misery they  experienced in the past. He adds that work, dutifulness, and  conscientiousness have promoted the Iraqis' lot. He goes on to  say that the pursuit of such an approach establishes a firm  course on which one can build. He notes that the regime that  does not pursue a firm course cannot have firm loyalists  defending it.    Saddam notes the problems facing marriageable young women,  saying: "I have been informed that when some girls are proposed  to by cousins, relatives, neighbors, or acquaintances, they say  that they want bridegrooms who are equal to their fathers in  stature. Well, do you know how your fathers were in the past?  Your fathers are now almost 50, or 60 years old. You see that  his house is covered with marble. You must realize that this  prestige has been achieved after 60 years of efforts. When your  father was 20-years old, he did not have this property. This  means that fathers have not enlightened their daughters as to  their true state of affairs 20 years ago. This spoils  daughters, because they would have unrealistic aspirations and  ambitions. They need to get married to new graduates. How can  these graduates own a house, a car, etcetera? Can ownership be  realized by anything other than work?"    Saddam urges Iraqis to cherish sublime values, contending  that car ownership should not turn into a form of ostentatious  behavior. The same goes for camel or cattle ownership, he says.    Saddam argues that Iraqis and Arabs always "viewed money as  a  means to a higher end." He urges Iraqi parents to enlighten  their children about the kind of life they led 20 years ago. He  also notes that "some boys are also exceeding the proper  bounds." He expresses the conviction that had the boys been  enlightened by their parents, they would not have "exceeded the  proper bounds."    Saddam adds: "You are the men of al-Ta'mim. Judging by your  conduct, one can say that the entire population of al-Ta'mim is  good. We do not have any concern about al-Ta'mim, nor do we  have any concern about al-Sulaymaniyah, Irbil, or Dahuk. This  is because normalcy will eventually prevail." [applause]    Saddam adds that the situation brought about by external  factors will become a thing of the past, from which the Iraqis  can learn lessons. He adds: "We will exercise amnesty when God  allows us to." Then, the good-natured men and women will take  charge, he notes.    Saddam goes on to say: "We have no fears about Karkuk or  Baghdad. We are full of faith that this country is as firm as  God wants it to be, and as God wants the faithful community to  be."    Afterward, Saddam wishes the al-Ta'mim delegation a bright  future.</p>

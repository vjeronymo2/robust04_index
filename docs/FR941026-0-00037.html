Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, had submitted a pesticide tolerance petition (PP 8F3689), and a food/feed additive petition (FAP 8H5567) to EPA requesting that the Administrator, pursuant to sections 408(d) and 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a(d), establish a tolerance for the fungicide fosetyl-Al, aluminum tris(O-ethylphosphonate), in or on pome fruit at 10 ppm and pome fruit juice and pome fruit pomace (wet and dry) at 12 ppm, respectively. Subsequently, the Agency reviewed an apple-processing study and concluded that section 409 tolerances for pome fruit juice and pome fruit pomace were unnecessary, and the food/feed additive petition was withdrawn. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA issued a notice, published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of August 3, 1994 (59 FR 39568), which announced that EPA was reissuing the pesticide petition (PP 8F3689) for the fungicide, aluminum tris(O-ethylphosphonate), in or on pome fruit at 10 ppm.

In this study, Charles River CD rats were dosed with aluminum tris(O-ethylphosphonate) at levels of 0, 2,000, 8,000, and 40,000/30,000 ppm (0, 100, 400, and 2,000/1,500 mg/kg bwt/day). The 40,000 ppm dose was reduced to 30,000 ppm after 2 weeks following observations of staining of the abdominal fur and red coloration of the urine at 40,000 ppm (2,000 mg/kg bwt/day). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The highest dose level of the chemical tested in the male Charles River CD-1 rats (2,000/1,500 mg/kg bwt/day) in this study appears to approximate a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) based on the finding of urinary bladder hyperplasia at this dose. Similarly, an MTD level appeared to be satisfied in the female Charles River CD-1 rats at the high-dose level of 2,000 mg/kg bwt/day, during the first 2 weeks of the carcinogenicity/chronic feeding study, before the dose level was reduced to 1,500 mg/kg bwt/day. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The study demonstrated a significantly elevated incidence of urinary bladder tumors (adenomas and carcinomas combined) at the highest dose level tested (2,000/1,500 mg/kg) in male Charles River CD-1 rats. The tumors were mainly seen in surviving males at the time of terminal sacrifice. The original pathological diagnosis of these tumors was independently confirmed by another consulting pathologist, who also reported an elevated incidence of urinary bladder hyperplasia in high-dose male rats. No increase in the incidence of urinary bladder tumors was observed in female rats. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1986, the Health Effects Division Peer Review Committee for Carcinogenicity of the Office of Pesticide Programs concluded that the available data provided limited evidence of the carcinogenicity of fosetyl-Al in male rats and classified the pesticide as a Category C carcinogen (possible human carcinogen with limited evidence of carcinogenicity in animals) in accordance with proposed Agency guidelines, published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of November 23, 1984 (49 FR 46294). The Health Effects Division Peer Review Committee for Carcinogenicity determined that a quantitative risk assessment was not appropriate for the following reasons: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The carcinogenic response observed with this chemical was confined solely to the high-dose males at one site (urinary bladder) in rats. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The tumor response was primarily due to an increase in benign tumors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The tumors were seen only in surviving animals at the time of terminal sacrifice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The carcinogenic effects were observed only at unusually high doses which exceed the commonly used limit dose of 1,000 mg/kg/day recommended as an upper-limiting dose for bioassays. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The chemical was not carcinogenic when administered in the diet to Charles River CD-1 mice at dose levels ranging from 2,500 to 30,000 ppm (357 to 4,286 mg/kg bwt/day). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Fosetyl-Al was not mutagenic in eight well conducted genotoxic assays. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1993, the Health Effects Division Peer Review Committee (PRC) for Carcinogenicity revisited the carcinogenicity classification of fosetyl-Al due to a recent 90-day feeding study of fosetyl-Al in rats which showed a strong association between the presence of uroliths in the urinary bladder and the incidence of urinary bladder tumors in treated rats. The PRC concluded that fosetyl-Al is not amenable to classification using the current Agency cancer guidelines. Based on a mechanistic evaluation of the only tumors seen, those that occurred at exceptionally high doses in the bladder of male rats, it appears that humans are not likely to be exposed to doses of fosetyl-Al that produce the urinary tract toxicity that precedes and seems to lead to the tumor response in rats. In particular, anticipated human dietary and occupational exposures to fosetyl-Al are far below the NOEL in rats for the apparent urinary tract tumor precursors (stone formation and attendant epithelial irritation). These effects are produced in rats at extremely high doses, under conditions not anticipated to occur outside of the experimental laboratory. The PRC concludes that pesticidal use of fosetyl-Al is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans. Therefore, the standard risk assessment approach of using the Reference Dose (RfD) based on systemic toxicity was applied to fosetyl-Al. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Using a 100-fold safety factor and the NOEL of 250 mg/kg bwt/day determined by the most sensitive species from the 2-year dog feeding study, the RfD is 3.0 mg/kg bwt/day. The theoretical maximum residue contribution (TMRC) from the established and proposed tolerances is 0.058818 mg/kg bwt/day and utilizes 2 percent of the RfD for the overall U. S. population. For exposure of the most highly exposed subgroup in the population, nonnursing infants, the TMRC is 0.130051 mg/kg bwt/day and utilizes 4 percent of the RfD. Previous tolerances have been established for fosetyl-Al, aluminum tris(O-ethylphosphonate), in asparagus, avocadoes, brassica vegetable crop group, caneberries, citrus, cucurbit vegetables group, dried hops, dry bulb onions, fresh ginseng root, leafy vegetables crop group, pineapples, pineapple forage and fodder, and strawberries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The metabolism of aluminum tris(O-ethylphosphonate) in plants is adequately understood. There is no reasonable expectation of secondary residues occurring in milk, eggs, and meat of livestock or poultry as a result of this use on pome fruit. Based on an apple-processing study, a concentration of fosetyl-Al into process fractions did not occur and food/feed additive tolerances are not needed in conjunction with these uses on pome fruit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An adequate analytical method, gas-liquid chromatography, is available for enforcement purposes. Because of the long lead time from establishing these tolerances to publication of the enforcement methodology in the Pesticide Analytical Manual, Vol. II, the analytical methodology is being made available in the interim to anyone interested in pesticide enforcement when requested from: Calvin Furlow, Public Information Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 242, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA 22202, (703-305-4432). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The pesticide is considered useful for the purposes for which the tolerances are sought. Based on the information and data considered, the Agency concludes that the establishment of the tolerances will protect the public health. Therefore, the tolerances are established as set forth below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20). A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fees provided by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, and the requestor's contentions on each such issue, and a summary of the evidence relied upon by the objection (40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following: there is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve on or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

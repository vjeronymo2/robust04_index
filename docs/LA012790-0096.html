			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FREEWAY LEAGUE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> ARIAS ENDS SLUMP TO SPARK FULLERTON  </P> <P> Rene Arias was not a factor in two quarters of Fullerton High School's 76-71  victory over Buena Park. But the senior guard was the main reason Fullerton won  the Freeway League basketball game Friday night at Fullerton.  </P> <P> Fullerton (7-11 overall, 4-1 in league play) remains tied for first place with  Sunny Hills; Buena Park (8-10, 3-2) falls a game back.  </P> <P> It was in the game's final minutes that Arias made his presence most felt.  </P> <P> Mired in an 0-for-10 second- and third-quarter shooting slump, Arias, the  Indians' leading scorer (19.5 points a game), broke out of it with the game on  the line. Fullerton held a 67-65 lead but went on to outscore Buena Park, 7-2,  to put the game out of reach.  </P> <P> Arias hit a three-pointer with 1:29 remaining to put the Indians ahead, 70-65.  He followed with another basket with 1:07 remaining for a 72-67 lead.  </P> <P> He capped off the run with two free throws with 39 seconds remaining to put  Fullerton up, 74-67. Arias, who made three of 13 shots and scored 12 points,  said he was undaunted by his cold shooting performance.  </P> <P> "It didn't bother me," Arias said. "I took good shots, they just missed."  </P> <P> Said Buena Park Coach Ed Matillo: "He's (Arias) a winner. He didn't hurt us the  whole game, but when it counts he's going to put it in."  </P> <P> Buena Park's Ray Lanier and Donyell Collins helped keep the score close, but  Collins fouled out with 2:50 remaining and the Coyotes trailing, 67-63. Collins  and Lanier each scored 21 points.  </P> <P> "It was an interestingly tight game," Fullerton Coach Chris Burton said.  "Neither team could hit the free throws enough to pull away."  </P> <P> Fullerton took its biggest lead of the night, 61-52, after Jason Black hit two  free throws early in the fourth quarter.

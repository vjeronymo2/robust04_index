			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Jobs: Smoothing the way to promotion - Study pinpoints the ways that organisations encourage the subtle art of buttering up the boss Twenty-one today, the Jobs column is. So now it has reached the traditionally recognised age of adulthood, it might perhaps be forgiven for raising an adult question: to wit, what are the real rules for getting to the top in organisations? My reason for asking is that over the years the answers fed to me in youth - working hard, being technically skilled and the like - have increasingly seemed childish fancies. What's more, my growing suspicion that political operations are at least equally important has been strengthened by a trickle of reports on such manoeuvrings by management researchers, some of whom have even devised tests to identify the types of politicians involved. For example, which of the following two recommendations do you readers think is the more effectual as a rule for getting to the top? 1 - 'When you ask someone to do something for you, it's best to give the real reasons for wanting it rather than reasons which might carry more weight.' 2 - 'Never tell anyone the real reason why you did something unless it is useful to do so.' Those of you who chose the second may care to know that you are on the way to branding your-selves politicians of classic style. The two statements are items from a test of Machiavellianism, defined as a propensity to be deceptive and manipulative in dealing with other human beings. Another, more specific mode of manoeuvring which has been pinpointed is described by the researchers as 'a set of assertive tactics which have the purpose of gaining the approbation of an audience that controls significant rewards for the actor'. A simpler term is 'ingratiation' or, more bluntly, 'buttering up the boss'. The most revealing study* of it which the Jobs column has seen is the work of a team led by Samuel Aryee of the National University of Singapore, who confidentially questioned 214 fellow Singaporeans working as managers or as professional specialists such as engineers in eight organisations, spanning both the public and the private sectors. The researchers' aim was *Published in the International Journal of Human Resource Management, Vol 4, No 1. to discover the circumstances in which ingratiating tactics were most apt to thrive. A particularly topical focus of the study was on the prevalence of the manoeuvre in employing outfits of different size and complexity. The reason for the topicality is that - if counter-productive politicking is more rife in bigger organisations, as many theorists believe - it should have been reduced by two recent developments. The first, which has definitely been taking place wholesale, is the 'delayering' exercises in which large companies have scrapped whole tiers of middle management. The second, which seems to be more talked about than actually put into effect, is the 'empowering' in which authority formerly held by the discarded middle rankers is handed down to the shop-floor. Besides taking account of organisational size, however, the the researchers examined links between ingratiating tactics and various characteristics of the 214 employees. One was whether they were managers operating through other people, or specialists directly responsible for their own results. A third was the extent to which the quality of their work could be gauged by objective yardsticks, as distinct from being measurable only in subjective ways. A fourth was whether their immediate boss had personal power to reward them richly with promotions or the like, or whether such decisions were made farther up the hierarchy. So what were the findings? It turned out that ingratiating tactics on the employees' part were most strongly linked with the power of the immediate boss to bestow rich rewards, and with jobs in which performance could not be objectively measured. The prevalence of the tactics was also significantly greater among the managers than among the more individually operating specialists. But, alas for the hopes that politicking has been reduced by delayering, ingratiating behaviour was just as rife in the smaller organisations as in the larger. Worse, since the empowerment of lower-level jobs would make them less subject to measurement by objective yardsticks, the study's findings suggest that the handing down of authority would result in increased political manoeuvring on the shop-floor. O ddly enough, Singaporeans also figure prominently in the table below which sheds some light on a question often asked by people considering taking a job overseas: 'How much would it cost to keep up the same living standard for my family?'. As in previous years, the figures are provided by the Employment Conditions Abroad consultancy, which keeps check on international pay-rates and the like. Anyone wanting to know about its services, which cover more than 150 countries, should contact Barry Rodin at 15 Britten St, London SW3 3TY; tel (0)71-351 7151, fax (0)71-351 9396. The pattern for the exercise is a middle manager such as the head of marketing in a medium sized company, from each of the nine countries covered. Starting with their typical gross salaries in their homeland. the table shows their typical annual outlay on consumer goods, housing costs excluded, on their own territory together with the price of keeping up the same buying habits in the remaining eight countries. Other currencies have been converted to sterling at the exchange rates of mid-December. The nationalities are ranked by their costs of their purchasing patterns in the eight countries other than their own - which gives the Singaporeans pride of place for overseas expensiveness, and the thrift award (as always) to the Japanese.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    Cost of keeping up home-country pattern of spending                                             on consumer goods when in: Nationality     Gross salary               United             United of mid-rank     in homeland    Singapore   States   Germany   Kingdom manager*           Pounds       Pounds     Pounds   Pounds    Pounds  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Singaporean        55,368       16,176     19,102   23,342    18,768 American           61,743       18,428     14,326   20,510    16,710 German             71,798       17,582     14,507   16,443    13,898 British            38,540       16,149     13,754   16,896    11,531 Swiss              77,332       17,608     14,545   17,633    13,928 French             52,980       16,261     14,127   16,745    13,625 Australian         34,238       14,591     11,683   14,496    11,887 Dutch              50,126       12,894     10,754   12,814     9,942 Japanese           85,970        8,229      7,704   10,064     8,409  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Nationality        Swit-                             Nether- of mid-rank        zerland      France    Australia  lands    Japan manager*           Pounds       Pounds     Pounds    Pounds   Pounds  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Singaporean        29,592       23,222     16,776   21,066    46,841 American           25,765       20,646     14,617   18,868    39,933 German             22,132       17,344     13,166   15,277    37,077 British            21,568       16,770     12,543   14,678    34,825 Swiss              20,727       17,379     13,196   15,301    37,142 French             21,833       15,487     12,696   15,026    35,219 Australian         18,468       14,321      9,741   12,944    30,418 Dutch              16,387       12,671      9,632   10,222    27,711 Japanese           12,789        9,528      7,349    9,145    12,645  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- * Responsible for function such as marketing in medium-sized company.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Armenian and Azerbaijani formations operating in  the zone of the Karabakh conflict have violated the cease-fire  agreement on several occasions, although the general situation  is relatively calm.    According to a well-informed source in the Azerbaijani  Defense Ministry, Karabakh soldiers fired at the Azerbaijani  positions in the Fizuli, Geranboy and Agdam regions.    The same source reports that a number of villages in  Azerbaijan's Tauz and Kedabek border regions were shelled from  Armenia and that personnel and equipment were transferred from  Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh.    Meanwhile, the Karabakh Defense Ministry's press service  reports that Azerbaijani units shelled Karabakh positions in the  Agdam direction last night. No return fire was opened.</p>

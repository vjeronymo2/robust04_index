			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL PLAYOFFS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> BOSTON BRUINS STILL BUFFALOED BY SABRES AFTER LOSING FIRST GAME, 6-0  </P> <P> The Buffalo Sabres struggled to edge the Hartford Whalers for third place in  the Adams Division. The Sabres needed to finish third to play the one team they  dominated during the regular season.  </P> <P> It was only because they played the tough Boston Bruins eight times that the  Sabres finished above .500. They were 5-0-3 over the Bruins in the regular  season.  </P> <P> The mastery continued in the opening game of the playoffs Wednesday night at  Boston. The Sabres, with four power-play goals in the first two periods and  outstanding goaltending from Jacques Cloutier, romped to a 6-0 victory.  </P> <P> The Sabres dominated from the start and Cloutier had few really tough moments.  He stopped 29 shots and registered his first playoff shutout.  </P> <P> Cloutier, the backup goalie, replaced injured Clint Malarchuk, who suffered a  deep slash in his neck, and was 4-1 in the last five games.  </P> <P> Despite his club's poor showing against Buffalo during the regular season,  Bruin Coach Terry O'Reilly was confident there would be a change in the  playoffs.  </P> <P> "I don't mean to slight Buffalo's goaltending," O'Reilly said. "But I feel real  confident with our goalies.  </P> <P> He selected Reggie Lemelin, who gave up six goals on 19 shots, the Sabres  getting three goals in their first six shots.  </P> <P> The Bruins will get another chance to beat the Sabres for the first time this  season tonight, again at Boston.  </P> <P> Vancouver 4, Calgary 3 -- The Flames were expected to blow away the Canucks in  four. Instead, the Flames find themselves down, 1-0, after a former Flame,  defenseman Paul Reinhart, scored at 2:47 of overtime at Calgary.  </P> <P> Halfway through the third period, Petri Skriko brought the Canucks even with  the first playoff goal of his career.  </P> <P> Thwarted after moving in front, 3-1, in the second minute of the second period,  the Flames fired six shots at goalie Kirk McLean in 2 1/2 minutes of overtime.  </P> <P> The teams play again tonight at Calgary.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh 3, New York Rangers 1 -- Two-time scoring champion Mario Lemieux was  a little shaky in his first playoff appearance, but fortunately, in Paul  Coffey, the Penguins had a playoff-tested star.  </P> <P> The offensive-minded defenseman scored two power-play goals at Pittsburgh to  give the Penguins a 1-0 lead in the best-of-seven series.  </P> <P> Lemieux had an assist, but most of the night he seemed to be bothered by the  close-checking Rangers.  </P> <P> Goalie Tom Barrasso, also a veteran of Stanley Cup play, gave a solid  performance, stopping 26 shots.  </P> <P> Montreal 6, Hartford 2 -- As expected, the Canadiens breezed in their opening  game at Montreal. A short-handed goal by Ryan Walter early in the second period  gave the Canadiens a 3-1 lead.  </P> <P> They broke it open with three scores in the last period. It was a costly win.  Veteran forward Bob Gainey, just back after missing six games with a sprained  left knee, reinjured the knee in the first period.  </P> <P> Washington 3, Philadelphia 2 -- For the first half of the game at Landover,  Md., the Flyers played tough defense and held a 2-1 lead.  </P> <P> But within 95 seconds shortly after the middle of the second period, the Flyers  lost it.  </P> <P> First, Rick Tocchet lost control of the puck at center ice, Kevin Hatcher got  the puck and set up Michal Pivonka for the tying goal. The Capitals quickly  went in front when Dale Hunter knocked Gord Murphy of the Flyers off the puck  and Lou Franceschetti grabbed it, went behind the net and his wraparound shot  hit goaltender Ron Hextall's stick into the net for the decisive goal.  </P> <P> Goals by Brian Propp and Tim Kerr in the first 12 minutes gave the Flyers a 2-0  lead.  </P> <P> Detroit 3, Chicago 2 -- Dave Barr scored two goals, and the Red Wings' tight  defense led the way at Detroit.  </P> <P> Detroit goalie Greg Stefan faced only 23 shots, but the Blackhawks scored  twice. However, Alain Chevrier, who had a 3-0 record against Detroit this  season, couldn't handle Barr.  </P> <P> St. Louis 4, Minnesota 3 -- It was only fitting that Brett Hull, who led the  Blues in scoring during the regular season, would get the winning goal at St.  Louis.  </P> <P> Hull, who had 41 goals, scored at 11:55 of overtime. Bob Brooke, who had not  scored since March 7, scored the three North Star goals. His last, with 2:35  left in regulation, sent it into overtime. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

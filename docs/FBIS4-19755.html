			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Bente Egjar Engesland "Background" article: "The Party Is </F> in His Pocket --But Not the Policies"]    [Text] With dictatorial power Carl I. Hagen yesterday took  apart the opposition in his party. Hagen owns the Progress  Party [FrP], but the party is in the process of slipping away  from him. Even if he held all the power in the national  conference hall, his standing in Norwegian political life is  less strong. Hagen's party only had 4.3 percent of voter  support in the most recent AFTENPOSTEN/Opinion poll.    The purge of the liberalist-liberal wing is being described  by delegates as a Stalinist trial. The forces of reaction have  now devoured their own children. Now the rules are being  followed, Hagen responds. The disloyalty of the "gang of four"  in the Storting group will be taken as an active act of  resignation from the party.    But will the Bolkesjo meeting also be the beginning of the  end for Hagen himself? In his ruthless attack from the  speaker's rostrum, he said that there is "deep disagreement" and  "division" in the FrP. Indeed, so strong is the abhorrence he  has become the target of among the minority that 44 delegates  abstained in the chairmanship election -- even though Hagen was  the only candidate. Hagen did not appear to the delegates in  the Telemark mountains to be the solid rock, but more like a man  who is desperately trying to hang on close to the edge.  Bolkesjo was a political disaster area where more than just  Hagen could need crisis counseling. Ellen Wibe and Ellen  Christine Christensen emerged as pale as corpses after their  boss had had his say. They had been rendered speechless. Women  are out.    It is of course possible to ask whether the liberalists  should not also look carefully at what course they should adopt  and ask themselves whether voluntary "exit" from the party is  actually logical. The liberalists say themselves that they back  the party's program -- they do not represent a real and full  political alternative.    Carl I. Hagen has used all the means at his disposal to  fight  to keep his position. It has become more important for Hagen to  lead the party than to engage in politics. Hagen was also the  only person on whom the majority at the conference was able to  unite. Policies were as good as absent. Since the party  chairman's initiative on taxation in the election campaign, not  even the fight against taxation is a simple matter.    Nevertheless, the message from Bolkesjo is "to the right"  and  an appeal to the party's original voters. Only one issue  succeeded in filling the conference with enthusiasm -- Hagen's  passionate address directed against "Islamic fundamentalism."  As psephologist Bernt Aardal has pointed out, it is well  documented that FrP voters differ from other parties' voters on  one point: immigration. There is a potential among the  Norwegian people for anti-immigration views, but Aardal also  takes the view that this is a dangerous policy area for the FrP  to concentrate exclusively on. Hostility toward immigrants has  its limit. When it tips over into pure, unadulterated racism  decent Norwegians are repelled.    Aardal sees greater scope in Hagen's radicalization of the  principle of a social policy that only embraces those who are  genuinely in need. Hagen says that those who only have their  own choices to thank for the state of their health should be  treated differently from those who fall ill through no fault of  their own. The "nicotine slaves" who were massively represented  at Bolkesjo did not stub out their cigarettes just because of  this.    And the remaining FrP members will steer clear of the EU  [European Union] battle, the biggest political issue since 1972.    While Bolkesjo Hotel opened up a panorama of beautiful,  proud, and snow-covered mountains, the FrP withdrew into the  darkness and worshiped narrow-mindedness.    "A future with its roots in the past" was the title of the  famous Hagen resolution that was pushed through by 94 votes  against 54. The FrP is an up-and-down party and could pull  itself up out of the ruins again. But the party has said  good-bye to the near future.</p>

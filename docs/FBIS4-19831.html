			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Flemings Would Rather Get Rid of </F> Belgium"]    [Text] A poll conducted by political scientists and  sociologists from Louvain revealed that 10.8 percent of the  Flemings tend toward separatism, while 44 percent are "Belgian  nationalists" or "hesitantly Belgians."    The demand to split up social security is supported by some  40 percent of the Flemings. This was published by CAMPUSKRANT,  the magazine of the Catholic University of Louvain (KUL). The  poll results are based on interviews carried out in early 1992  among 2,691 Flemings. Based on this poll, the researchers Bart  Maddens, Roeland Beerten, and Jaak Billiet describe 30.8 percent  of the Flemings as "Belgian nationalists," 10.8 percent as  "Flemish nationalists," and 32.8 percent as "regionalists." The  latter identify with Flanders but are not anti-Belgium. Among  the respondents, 13.2 percent are "hesitantly Belgians." They  are very Belgium-minded, except when it comes to social  security. An opposite attitude is found among the "hesitant  regionalists" (12.5 percent). A remarkable phenomenon is that  one-third of the voters whose party preference goes to the  Vlaams Blok [Flemish Bloc], are "Belgian nationalists" and  "hesitant Belgians." The Volksunie [The People's Union] has the  highest percentage (71.3 percent) of "Flemish nationalists" and  "regionalists." Most of the "Belgian nationalists" are found in  the SP [Socialist Party] (38.9 percent), followed by Agalev  [Green Party] (34.9 percent), and the CVP [Christian People's  Party] (32.4 percent). Pro-Flemish people are found more among  highly educated and less among noneducated people.    The "Belgian nationalists" attach much less importance to  community problems than others and consequently form a silent  majority. "As is often the case, we are dealing with a fervent  minority, whose ideas get the most response from politicians and  in the media," Billiet concludes.</p>

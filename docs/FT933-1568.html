			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Days of whine and poses: Yeltsin and Rutskoi are staking out their positions in a gamble to wrest control of Russia If the next few days are calm', said Mr Yegor Gaidar, now back as first deputy prime minister with a presidential 'coup' in his in-tray as well as an economic crisis, 'and there are no confrontations, then the situation should stabilise'. Day one of direct presidential rule has gone to Mr Boris Yeltsin. After the grand theatre of the swearing-in of General Alexander Rutskoi as acting president in the Russian parliament early yesterday, an anticlimax was palpable. The military pledged continuing support to the president: General Pavel Grachev, the defence minister - not an enthusiast for Mr Yeltsin's decision - assured him of the 'full' support of the armed forces; General Valery Mironov, the deputy defence minister, speaking in the General Staff academy, said he had spent Tuesday night calling regional commanders, to find that 'most' serving officers viewed politics as something to avoid. But to be safe, he had banned all political meetings in army units, and believed his orders were being obeyed. There are demonstrations, but they are small. The parliament's supporters gathered outside the White House are elderly, or young-thuggish, or drunk, or a little daft: there are few respectable citizens and almost no enthusiastic youth, as there were, in large numbers, on the days and nights of the August coup in 1991. The cabinet of ministers has suffered only one defection - Mr Sergei Glaziev, the young minister for foreign economic affairs - who, colleagues said, had wanted to go primarily because he could not work with Mr Gaidar, and not because of his stated reason that he could not accede to the president's decree. In the regions, most administration leaders and even some heads of local soviets (councils) are voicing support for Mr Yeltsin. It is often lukewarm: Mr Boris Nemtsov, the reformist governor of the industrially important Nizhny Novgorod region, said local people had better things to do than worry about what was happening in Moscow. No matter (for Mr Yeltsin) - indifference is fine, only active opposition need worry him. Mr Yeltsin has a plan for 'step by step' reform, which is beginning to be set in train. Elections are to be called for the new parliament on December 11-12: the country will be governed by presidential decree and government decisions for the next eleven and a half weeks. During that time, the standing constitutional convention will be convened to discuss and pass Mr Yeltsin's variant of the constitution - which, once agreed, will be put to the newly elected parliament for approval as its first duty. Parliamentary commissions organised by the government (constitutionally, commissions have fallen under the jurisdiction of the parliament) are now being set up with the assistance of the regional administrations - who were told yesterday by Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, that their leaders would be held personally responsible for carrying out the decree Mr Yeltsin signed last night. Elections will take place only to the lower house of the new Federal Assembly - that house to be known as the State Duma. Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, also brought back in his former role of first deputy prime minister, said yesterday it had been decided that 270 of its 400 deputies would be elected from single member constituencies, with a further 130 elected by party lists. This last measure will give fledgling parties a role, and a lever for exerting party discipline. The upper house, or Council of the Federation, will not initially be elected. It has already been created as a standing advisory body, and is and will be composed of the leaders of the regional and republican administrations and soviets - thus being transformed into the senior legislative chamber. Pressed for his view, Mr Gaidar said yesterday that he expected this body would in the course of next year also be elected - and that there would be presidential elections, as Mr Yeltsin has indicated, in that period. 'It is step by step, step by step,' Mr Gaidar repeated. Three main dangers confront Mr Yeltsin and his government in the weeks ahead, before elections allow the people to speak. First, that Mr Yeltsin, as was his wont after the August 1991 coup and again after the April 1993 referendum, may fritter away his advantage in inactivity and unfocused activity. He has prepared relatively carefully for this juncture - making sure of the allegiance of the armed forces, progressively diminishing his vice-president, and last week bringing back Mr Gaidar. He must now push through action on every front - political and economic especially, but also on what might be called the public relations level, appearing as the relaxed and paternal president who offers no threat to anyone except the malevolent. (He did some of this yesterday, with a little walkabout through central Moscow with his interior minister, Mr Viktor Yerin, in tow.) His health and his attention must both hold steady - and most of all, his will. Second, he may act, but wrongly. He is no economist: though understanding the difficulties and prepared to address them, he is also a populist by instinct and prone to throw money at problems. Mr Gaidar observed yesterday that a pre-election period was not the most promising time to expect discipline in economic matters. Mr Yeltsin - and his political advisers - will find their sense of what is economically right severely tested in the weeks ahead as they seek to have elected a parliament which will find their policies acceptable. Third, and most seriously, Mr Yeltsin may act, and act wisely - but in doing so store up such a pressure of protest as to threaten his own position and that of the government. Parliament was more than inconvenient for him - it posed a direct challenge to his authority and to his decisions. It could hardly be otherwise in a political system where the division of powers was not defined and the natural belief of many, perhaps most, of the deputies was in the necessity for the state to intervene, to plan and to control, in order to address the problems about which their constituents complained and which they themselves could so clearly see about them. Parliament was a great, even threatening, pain and obstruction, but it was a vent to opposition and to grievance. Its abolition - or rather, its transformation into a parallel power - could give grievances that have remained rhetorical so far a militant, even armed, character. There were uniformed men toting Kalashnikovs in the White House yesterday, and Russian reporters said that plainclothed young men were carrying them last night. Gen Rutskoi has appointed three anti-Yeltsinites to the posts of ministers of defence, security and interior. His defence minister, General Vladislav Achalov, ordered military cadets with side-arms to report to the parliament to protect it and was thwarted by Gen Grachev - but will presumably try again, as will his colleagues, to give their paper authority real weight. A package of economic measures is being prepared by the government: if these are to address the central problem of inflation, they will mean cuts in the budget, and thus in social programmes, and in funding to enterprises. None will be without social costs. If they are to be pushed through before the election - Mr Yeltsin and his government may decide to hold off in this period - there will be real, legitimate grievances to deal with. But how? How tolerant can even a temporary autocrat be? How far can he discriminate between grievance and attempts to destabilise, even overthrow him? And how far can he count on moderation from leaders of nationalist and communist groups who have nothing to gain from acquiescence to his will? Day one of this new and febrile era may thus be a harbinger of a relatively peaceful transition period to real elections - or a pause before the opposition forces, which include Gen Rutskoi, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, Mr Vladimir Isakov and Mr Sergei Baburin, leaders of the communist-nationalist movements, and others who are energetic, resourceful and do not lack allies, make their plans and whip up organised revolt on the fertile soil which an impoverished and fearful population offers. Mr Yeltsin, against the judgment of many in his entourage, has made a break for a new order: the old one is far from dead.</p>

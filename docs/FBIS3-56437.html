This afternoon did you see the prime minister?    [Gaydar] No, I did not see the prime minister today.    [Dorenko] You did not have any telephone conversations with  either the president or the prime minister -- no contacts?    [Gaydar] No. Today I did not speak either with the prime  minister or the president, and there is nothing surprising in  this because after all the matter had been decided earlier.  Indeed, on Sunday the fact of my resignation, my statement on  my resignation was just made public but I had already had a talk  with the president on Thursday, and overall the main question  was decided then.    [Dorenko] Did the premier and president try to dissuade you  from resigning?    [Gaydar] No, the president regarded my position with  understanding.    [Dorenko] Naturally, and Kozyrev's visit?    [Gaydar] Andrey is an innate diplomat; he always tries his  utmost to find a point of contact. [passage omitted]    [Dorenko] Will the communists be able to force Chernomyrdin  to change his policy, do you think he might perhaps willingly do  that himself?    [Gaydar] I do not think the communists will manage to force  Chernomyrdin to change his policy, and I do not think Viktor  Stepanovich will himself want to radically change course. It is  another matter that politics consists of pretty difficult  decisions that are being taken every day.    [Dorenko] But he is already under pressure, pressure from  the  communists in the Duma. And if we were to talk of a coalition  government, then there would be the Party of Russian Unity and  Accord -- Shokhin -- and many from Russia's Choice and  Zaveryukha from the Communists and the Agrarians. If you are  going now, and Zyuganov is not satisfied with the policy of  Chernomyrdin and the remaining Russia's Choice people, he may  find himself under double pressure from Russia's Choice and the  Communists, may he not?    [Gaydar] In the first place, in realistic terms, following  the adoption of the new constitution, the government's  independence is substantially greater than it was in 1992-93.  Therefore, I would say that today it is not a matter of  political pressure from one or another group, but rather of  pressure of circumstances, pressure from branches of industry,  from major complexes and enterprises, which of course would not  want to part with their subsidies, would not want to restructure  production, would of course want their problems to be resolved  through new inflationary taxes, at the taxpayer's expense.    [Dorenko] How soon do you reckon your party comrades in  Russia's Choice will quit the government, or how soon will they  be forced out?    [Gaydar] Well, that is a hypothetical question, almost a  conjectural one. I reckon that in many aspects, where the  policy being conducted by the government merits support, our  colleagues can and must work. I would mention here  international affairs, and in general the privatization policy  which one would wish to sustain.    [Dorenko] Is that because they are approved by and directly  supervised by the presidential staff, or because ...-    [Gaydar, interrupting] I would even say that it is not the  presidential staff but simply the president. In Russia it was  traditional for international affairs to be outside the  competence of the Cabinet of Ministers, however this was  composed, and this has been the case recently, too. This is  primarily the president's sphere, and he determines things.    [Dorenko] So Russia's foreign policy will, to judge from all  indications, remain as before, and the minister of foreign  relations, the minister of foreign affairs, will stay. [passage  omitted]    Boris Fedorov, it is reported, was today offered the post  only of minister of finance and not vice premier, that is, he  may not replace you in your post. At the same time he evidently  put forward some requirements, and the Council of Ministers  session has been put off to tomorrow. What do you think, what  are the requirements in which your party comrade will stay?    [Gaydar] I think they will be quite simple and impersonal:  sufficient control of monetary and credit policy if everyone  believes anyway that he is responsible for it.    [Dorenko] Organizationally speaking, does that mean control  of Gosbank?    [Gaydar] As to organization, it primarily means effective  interaction with the Central Bank.    [Dorenko] To what extent is Chernomyrdin ready to support  Fedorov today?    [Gaydar] That is a question for Viktor Stepanovich.    [Dorenko] You know the atmosphere in the government. Who is  closer to Chernomyrdin, Gerashchenko or Fedorov with his demands  as regards economic policy?    [Gaydar] Viktor Stepanovich would, I think, like to keep  both.    [Dorenko] Both. And both directions of policy.    [Gaydar] And both directions of policy.    [Dorenko] Is that in order to set them against each other or  ...    [Gaydar, interrupting] Simply because to a certain extent  this is in keeping with his approach to the conduct of economic  policy.    [Dorenko] The leak of information which we have that Skokov  may be made vice premier; is it likely?    [Gaydar] I would not rule out such a possibility, although  it  seems to me unlikely.    [Dorenko] I see. To all appearances there is another option  for the development of events in which there remains just Oleg  Soskovets as vice premier. In that case the whole scheme of the  government changes, and would that, in your view, resolve the  crisis?    [Gaydar] You see, the economic crisis cannot be resolved by  a  redistribution of portfolios. It is being resolved by change or  continuation of policy. Concentration of attention on  redistribution of portfolios greatly personalizes what is  happening. In my view it is much more important how many and  what kind of expenditure decisions are made by the government in  the course of the next two weeks than the question of who is in  what office.    [Dorenko] I also wanted to ask a question about your party.  Now you are heading the faction in the Duma and your first  deputy Gennadiy Burbulis has already twice -- or at least once  -- declared this and twice tried to organize a presidential  party. Will you attempt to set up a party or structure your  faction in an attempt to create a presidential party?    [Gaydar] In the first place, the development of events,  including the development of events as manifested in the  elections on 12 December, fully and obviously indicate the need  for the establishment of an effective structure supporting  democracy and reforms in Russia.    That is obvious. How is this task to be embarked on? How is  it to be done? How is it to be made non-sectarian? That still  has to be tackled and ways have to be found of doing it.    [Dorenko] And you will head this government?    [Gaydar] You know, this is again much less a question of  personality than of content. This organization, largely from an  historical point of view, now has two tasks: To prevent  military ventures which we are now being nudged towards, and to  prevent a fresh division of property with its accompanying huge  social cataclysms. The movement, the party, the public force  which makes this its tasks merits, in my view, the most serious  support.    [Dorenko] Thank you, Yegor Timurovich.</p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Survey of Japan (5): Yes, we have no bananas - A look at the potential for more de-regulation When The Body Shop wanted to sell in Japan shampoo made from bananas, it took one-and-a-half years to get the necessary approvals. 'They never thought of bananas as an ingredient,' says Mrs Mitsu Kimata, head of the UK company's operation in Japan, about the attitude of Ministry of Health and Welfare officials. Water melons are also not on the approved list of cosmetic ingredients. So bringing in a sun-care product made from this fruit is also taking time. 'I hope we can get it next summer, but it was developed last year.' Not surprisingly, she adds: 'Japan is one of the most restrictive countries that Body Shop operates in.' The complaint is echoed by a host of foreign, and many local, companies in Japan. Despite government initiatives to promote deregulation - the latest was announced last month - there is scepticism about the pace of change, especially now the government has changed yet again. 'It'll take light years,' says Mr Peter Woods, president of Rover Japan, about the prospects for progress. A recent survey of foreign companies in Japan, of which there are more than 3,000, showed that 58 per cent thought it was more difficult to operate there than in other advanced countries. The extreme cost of land and rents was the main reason, followed by high prices of goods - generally twice as high as in other industrialised countries - and the number of government regulations. However, the survey by LBS, a firm which provides services to non-Japanese companies, did find that 39 per cent of respondents felt it had become easier to do business in Japan. But the progress of deregulation was well down the list of reasons for this. Companies felt instead that more goodwill was now being shown to outsiders, while they had developed a better understanding of Japanese business customs. Either way, said Mr Homare Takenaka, a senior managing director at IBM Japan (which helped set up LBS), in the survey's foreword, 'the Japanese market as seen from foreign eyes is still fraught with many obstacles in the form of regulations and puzzling business practices.' The latest government package promised action on 279 regulations. These cover housing and land, telecommunications and financial markets, as well as the acceptance of foreign inspection data and standards for more imports. There are more than 10,000 regulations inhibiting an estimated 40 per cent of the economy. Former prime minister Mr Morihiro Hosokawa last year launched a five-year campaign to sweep away this forest of rules after previous governments had failed to reduce them. Japan's bureaucratic system served the country well as the economy recovered and grew after World War Two. 'The Japanese system has been built on the philosophy that this is a country poor in resources but rich in people,' says Mr Takenaka. But growth has changed all that. 'Now, we are at an economic stage where Japan is not poor. It should be more open to foreign companies and people, more free. But the historical heritage remains as a barrier.' One area where Japan has been most heavily criticised is car imports, still only accounting for 5 per cent of the total market. For years, foreign makes were hindered by high tariffs and a raft of regulations. The tariffs have gone and it is much easier to sell foreign cars; the streets of Tokyo are full of them. Helped by the strong yen, car imports have soared this year. But there are still big hindrances, says Mr Woods. 'The Japanese are rather consistent, stubborn and rather networked.' The Ministry of Transport is slow to change its rules - especially on inspection - and has to be persuaded, even if the pressure is coming from high political level; some politicians, pursuing special interests, obstruct attempts to free up the system. Also, there are informal rules which are hard for outsiders to comprehend. 'Guidelines are operated which are almost not written. There is a tremendous level of power in the hands of the bureaucrats.' This they will not give up lightly. Mr Nobuhiko Kawamoto, president of the Honda car company, notes: 'Everybody talks of deregulation - but if it is implemented full-scale, there will be a lot of lay-offs among bureaucrats and civil servants.' The high level of regulation keeps prices high. Japanese workers at Honda making the same cars as its workers in the US earn more at the current yen rate. 'Yet the standards of living enjoyed by the Japanese workers are far below those enjoyed by the Americans.' The experience of The Body Shop shows how regulations keep up costs. Currently, it can sell less than 70 per cent of the full range of products in Japan. Mrs Kimata hopes to raise this to 85 per cent next year. If ingredients - such as exotic fruits or oils - are not on the ministry's approved list for cosmetics, there are delays due to testing (for which the company pays). She hopes deregulation will ease the way for Body Shop products and make them cheaper. But many Japanese companies would benefit, too. 'Deregulation will create new businesses,' believes Mr Masaya Miyoshi, director general of the Keidanren, the business federation. 'Companies, citizens and customers will be encouraged to think about their own responsibilities. Finally, we will get away from the umbrella government.'</p>

			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Survey of Technology in the Office (12): A more radical approach - Facilities Management Recession has widened the scope of facilities management. Today, more and more companies are concentrating on their core businesses and placing other services in the hands of outside contractors. No longer is it just a question of whether to contract out catering, security and office cleaning. Big companies are starting to hand over responsibility for everything from accounting to personal computers to the corporate network. There is nothing new about contracting out projects and services to external companies. But recently many companies have started to take a more radical approach, often with assets and or staff being transferred to the service company. This approach (often referred to as outsourcing) is being applied to information technology (IT) and other functions, notably finance. For example, BP Exploration (Europe) recently contracted out its accounting function. In the IT area, facilities management-outsourcing is growing at a compound annual rate of 18.5 per cent in Europe, according to Mr Morgan David of the International Data Corporation. IDC predicts that the European market will be worth Dollars 4.9bn by 1996. Two associated benefits of facilities management (FM) are that it can cut costs and increase business focus. J P Morgan, the US bank, and US razor company Gillette, have both opted for a new but fast-growing branch of facilities management - managed networks. They have handed over the management of their international data networks to BT in a move to cut the costs of their existing operations and streamline. J P Morgan's five-year agreement, worth about Dollars 20m, is expected to save the company Dollars 12.5m in operating expenses. Mr Rick Manser, Gillette's communications manager, says that opting for a managed network 'gives Gillette the ability to continue to focus on our consumer product lines rather than expending time, money and effort on international data networking.' FM is not only attractive to commercial companies. Public sector organisations such as local authorities and government departments are also turning to FM. For example, Berkshire County Council has contracted out its printing to Kodak Facilities Management and cut costs by about 15 per cent. Hertfordshire County Council, which saved money by contracting out its computers and telecoms services last year, has just decided to contract out the management and support of its PCs and local area networks. The Pounds 250,000-a-year PC FM deal includes the transfer of six PC support staff from Hertfordshire County Council to UK company ITnet. They join the 45 staff transferred under the earlier Pounds 2m-a-year FM deal. Cost-savings are not the only benefits of opting for FM. Some companies contract out services because they are not happy with the quality of in-house equivalents, or because they want greater flexibility. 'Many opt for FM while they are transferring from one technology to another,' says Mr Peter Falconer, associate director of computer services company Hoskyns. For example, UK retailer Mothercare contracted out its computers to Hoskyns, while it was transferring from IBM mainframes to smaller IBM systems (AS/400s). It needed to keep its old systems running while it was developing software to run on the new machines. But despite the benefits of FM, there are a number of risks: Loss of ad hoc services: Judith Wainwright, a director of London-based management consultants Pagoda, says: 'Most in-house functions provide a range of valuable services to the business informally. For example, working late to help solve business problems. Many of these may not be covered by an outsourcing contract and are effectively withdrawn causing dissatisfaction with service.' High costs for extras: Although competitive tendering is likely to keep down the costs of the contract, suppliers may use changing requirements as a way of improving on margins. Extras not specified in the contract (such as extra computer power) may work out very expensive. Loss of in-house expertise: Once services have been contracted out, it may be difficult to bring them back in-house. This is especially true of computer services. Many of the computer FM contracts in place have not run their full course, so there are few documented examples of companies trying to staff and run a computer centre again. Loss of confidentiality: One of the most recent public sector organisations to consider computer FM is the UK's Inland Revenue. It is talking to a number of suppliers about the possibility of contracting out the computer processing of tax returns. However, critics of the proposal argue that information about taxpayers is too sensitive to be handled by private-sector staff. And some commercial companies resist FM (or restrict it to certain areas) because they worry that confidential data will get into the wrong hands. FM suppliers counter that their procedures are often stricter than those of their clients. Loss of competitive advantage: Before contracting out an activity, companies should ask themselves how it affects their competitive strength in their main markets. US researchers Frost &amp; Sullivan say those activities which are unique to the company or based on company-specific skills provide competitive advantage and should be kept in-house. But if an activity is mature (such as printing or staff catering), outside suppliers can probably manage it just as well and at lower cost. Limited redress for poor service: Unless the level of service required by the user company is spelt out in the contract, it may be difficult to get redress for poor performance. Or the redress may be insufficient if a crucial business function is affected. One reason for outsourcing is a belief in market forces and healthy competition. But Wainwright warns: 'Some companies take it to extremes and encourage individual managers to replace internal work with external contracts at will. This can lead to fragmentation, with many external suppliers providing overlapping services, and failure to obtain the best deal for the whole company.'</p>

The party shall carefully define the equipment population to which the monitoring program applies. Defined populations may be a specific type of car or cars equipped with a specific type of brake system or air brake system component.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) No cars receiving single car tests due to inspections or repairs made prior to their required periodic freight brake or single car test due date shall be included in the population.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The request shall be based on a valid statistical analysis of the periodic freight brake or single car test failure rate of the population. The statistical analysis shall be based on the entire population or a random sample size of the population large enough to give a 95% confidence levels that the periodic freight brake, single car, or single unit train test failure rate of the sample accurately reflects the failure rate of the population as a whole.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> 3.0&blank;Outline of Overall Statistical Analysis Procedure <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Objective. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  To determine and readjust, as necessary, an inspection interval that ensures with 95% confidence that less than the following percentages of in-service units have a defect that would cause failure to pass the periodic freight brake or single car test at any point in time (population percent defective).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) 5% for conventional freight equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) 3% for intermediate speed freight equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) 3% for conventional passenger or commuter equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) 2% for intermediate speed passenger or commuter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) 1% for high speed passenger equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Procedure. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  The following procedure shall be used to perform a statistical analysis to justify a change in the time interval between required periodic freight brake tests or single car tests of an equipment population:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Define the population to which the analysis applies and notify the FRA in writing of the intent to request a change in the time interval between required tests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The phase in period required by &sect;232.609 shall be completed for the population selected for analysis before the sampling period starts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The records of the results of required scheduled single car tests or required scheduled periodic freight brake tests described in &sect;232.615(a) shall be kept.

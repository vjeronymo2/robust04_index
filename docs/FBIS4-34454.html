			<p>BFN     [Text] Brasilia, 17 Jun (AFP-NA) -- The Brazilian Foreign  Ministry on 17 June expressed its malaise over the stance taken  by Argentina during the Ibero-American Summit of heads of state  and government held in Cartagena de Indias (Colombia) last week  concerning its endorsement of Mexican President Carlos Salinas  de Gortari as a candidate for the GATT presidency.    Notwithstanding this, a Brazilian diplomatic spokesman told  AFP NEWS AGENCY that the suspension of Argentine Economy  Minister Domingo Cavallo's visit to Brasilia -- scheduled for  the end of June -- until July was a "coincidence" and had  nothing to do with the other issue, as had been hinted at by the  local press on 17 June.    The Itamaraty (seat of the Brazilian Foreign Ministry)  spokesman reported that having officially announced the  candidacy of Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero for GATT's  presidency on 7 June, the Brazilian Government informed its  Latin American counterparts.    On that occasion, Argentina and Mexico -- without making any  type of commitments -- allegedly had been in favor of Ricupero's  candidacy to replace Irishman Peter Sutherland.    This is why it was considered in "poor taste" that another  candidate was proposed and supported in the absence of the  Brazilian delegation (when President Itamar Franco left the  summit due to the unexpected death of his nephew and private  secretary, Ariosto Franco).    The same source said, nonetheless, that this will neither  affect Brazil's good relations with Argentina nor the Common  Market of the South [Mercosur] integration process, nor  negotiations on the establishment of a South American Free Trade  Zone sponsored by Brazil.    The suspension of Cavallo's trip to Brazil was made at the  request of the Brazilian Finance Ministry, which at the time  originally scheduled for his visit -- the end of June -- will be  putting the final touches on the implementation of the new  currency at par with the dollar -- the real -- scheduled for 1  July.    Cavallo's visit surely will take place at the end of July  after the Mercosur summit in Buenos Aires that will be attended  by Argentine President Carlos Menem, Brazilian President Itamar  Franco, Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy, and Uruguayan  President Luis Alberto Lacalle.</p>

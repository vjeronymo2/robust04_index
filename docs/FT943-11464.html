			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / International Company News: Banpais - Correction The FT last week in the international edition reported that Banpais, the Mexican bank, took out a loan to pay back debt arising from the acquisition of Asemex, an insurance company, after an equity offering had not raised the amount planned. That loan was in fact taken out before the equity offering, and was not directly related to the Asemex purchase.</p>

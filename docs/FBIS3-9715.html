Dr. Mate  Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and foreign minister,  said this when he submitted a report on the Washington  agreements to the Croatian Parliament's Chamber of Deputies.  Here is a report by Jasminka Dudic:    [Dudic] With the Washington agreements we are entering a new  era of relations with the world. It is our view that we have  real prospects and guarantees that we will in future resolve our  aspirations and difficulties with the help and support of the  international community. The doors to inclusion in both the  Council of Europe and the EU, entry into the Partnership for  Peace initiative, and financial support from the world are  opening for us, Dr. Granic said.    After recalling the road of the Croatian president and of  our  foreign policy which led to the Washington agreements, Dr.  Granic stressed that the path ahead of us will not be simple and  that now, in the negotiations on the resolution of the crisis in  Bosnia- Herzegovina, the Serb side should also be included.    Speaking about the resolution of the crisis in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and the reintegration of the UNPA [UN  Protected Area] zones, Dr. Granic also said:    [Begin Granic recording] We have firm guarantees that the  sanctions, the possible alleviation of them, or even their  substitution will be and will remain a crucial means for  achieving a just and satisfactory solution both in Croatia and  in Bosnia- Herzegovina. In other words, sanctions will continue  to remain in place as a punishment but also as a stimulus and as  a signal to the Serb side, in other words to Belgrade, that this  is now an exceptionally favorable moment for the achievement of  a global solution and for a new leaf to be turned. [end  recording]    [Dudic] The Croatian signature on the Washington documents  is  an expression of the continuity of Croatian state policy  vis-a-vis the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the legitimate  aspirations of the Croat people. However, on the consequences  of the unpreparedness of the international community to put a  stop to the Serb aggression and ethnic cleansing, Dr. Granic  said:    [Begin Granic recording] These have led to phenomena of the  exacerbation of the circle of distrust and a conflict of  interests even amongst the victims of the Greater Serb  aggression. The violation of international and war law, which  has occurred on both sides and which further deepened tensions,  should not be forgotten either. Serious clashes took place  between members of the Croat and Muslim Bosniak nations, and  these became ever more destructive both for the relations  between these two nations and also for the future of  Bosnia-Herzegovina as a state, for the unity of the Croatian  nation, and for the position of the Republic of Croatia in the  world.    In the struggle against the Serb aggressor, the Croat nation  in Bosnia-Herzegovina developed its own armed forces as well as  its own institutions of power in the form of the Croat republic  of Herceg-Bosna, and it expressed its awareness that future  resolutions of its position must be developed, starting from the  principles of full respect for its sovereign will in those areas  where for centuries it has been the majority population. The  Republic of Croatia was not able to remain indifferent to the  other sides in respect of the ever more explicit danger for the  whole of the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina. [end recording]    [Dudic] The foreign minister also dwelled in detail on the  strategic importance of the agreements and documents signed and  said, among other things, that the preliminary agreement starts  clearly from the separate identities of two states which do not  intend to rush into the immediate creation of a confederation,  but go for cooperation in the economic and defense fields. The  Croatian leadership will persevere in its policies to achieve  the reintegration of the UNPA zones, in other words the peaceful  option, but, Dr. Granic stressed, we cannot accept the  continuation and intensification of the current situation for  the forseeable future. He repeated Croatian demands connected  with changes to and the greater effectiveness of UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Forces]. He also stressed that in future we will link  the process of the normalization of relations with the FRY with  progress in the process of the reintegration of temporarily  occupied territory into the overall systems of the Republic of  Croatia.    At the end of his address, Dr. Granic once again recalled  that the basic aims of our overall policy -- including our  foreign policy -- remain unchanged and that in this process we  are remaining faithful to a firm orientation toward Europe. A  debate on the report on the Washington agreements is under way  in the Chamber of Deputies.</p>

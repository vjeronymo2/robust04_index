			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Crisis in Russia: Drama in streets is pure theatre THE posters, lashed to the railings round the White House like cardboard suffragettes, were violent enough. 'Yeltsin's threat to the Supreme Soviet is a threat to the Russian People] Enough of this alcoholic] We must strengthen Russia]'; 'The people trust and support their Supreme Soviet] No to elections] Yeltsinism out of Russia]'; 'Zionists and swindlers - out]'. But the crowd around the White House late yesterday morning, numbering perhaps 2,000 - 3,000, were more farcical than tragic. Many were elderly. A little glee-club of women pensioners, sitting behind a banner proclaiming the Young Communist League, sang Soviet anthems, charmingly. Another lady recited a poem - passionately patriotic, summoning the spirit of Russia from the depths. Several circles were simply being informed by the more learned of their number as to what was happening. A lady held out a bucket to gather small-denomination notes in support of the people manning the 'barricades' - mainly constructed out of rusting radiators, of which the defenders must have found a store. The sun shone, the air was mild. There were many red Soviet banners, but more black yellow and white Imperial standards, and St Andrews' crosses - the standard red white and blue Russian flag evidently regarded as that of the enemy. Several men were writing up lists of supporters or future combatants - one young man held a placard saying 'soldiers for Rutskoi', but there was no sign of any recruits. Mr Igor Kressitsky, a pensioner, held a copy of the newspaper Den (the influential far-right weekly) and regretted the loss of the Soviet Union. 'We were one people, do you understand, and as one people we were great and we had peace here and peace in the world. Can you deny that? Can you?' The largest group was laughing. On approach, it was revealed they were laughing at an improvised play being acted out by an elderly, patriarchal Russian called Sergei with a white beard and glinting eyes, and a youngish American called Steve. Sergei was teasing Steve. 'Now, Steve, Steve, listen to me, Russia is not as wretched as it looks. Even I am not as wretched as I look. Steve, don't be deceived by my appearance. I am one of a great people. Steve, we threw back the Germans ourselves. Now we are throwing back the Americans] No, Steve, don't worry, we are friends, I have the warmest feelings for you, come and drink something at my house, only unfortunately I have no whisky for you.' Steve, who spoke some Russian but not enough to parry Sergei in the midst of a laughing crowd, said something about wishing to be friendly with everyone. 'Steve, this is my idea. My idea. I want you to tell it to the American Ambassador, what is his name?' Steve did not know. 'Pickering', I said. 'Picketing, picket (the word is the same in Russian). He is a picket here with us, the ambassador. How wonderful, he supports us.' (The crowd in transports of delight). 'You see, Steve, we are all friends, you, me, the American ambassador . . .' Relieving Steve finally of his embarrassment, Sergei led him out of the circle of the crowd with every apparent attention of taking him home for a drink.</p>

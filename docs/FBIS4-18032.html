			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Crime Press correspondent Larisa Kislinskaya] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 28 Apr--The forces maintaining public order  over the Easter and 1 May holidays will be increased  considerably, Militia Lieutenant General Vyacheslav Ogorodnikov,  head of the chief directorate for the maintenance of public  order of Russia's Ministry of Internal Affairs, told a Crime  Press correspondent.    Reinforced detachments will be posted around cemeteries and  churches where services and religious processions are to be  held. Measures for maintaining public order will be in operation  outside churches until six a.m., the finishing time for the  religious processions.    Reinforced posts will be mounted on 1 May at sites of mass  public demonstrations, rallies, and marches. According to our  information, these include Triumphal Square, Tverskaya Street,  Manezhnaya and Kaluzhkaya Squares, and the University Metro  station area.    As Ogorodnikov emphasized, the maintenance of public order  will be implemented entirely by Moscow militia forces. Ministry  of Internal Affairs troops are only being kept in reserve should  unforeseen circumstances arise.</p>

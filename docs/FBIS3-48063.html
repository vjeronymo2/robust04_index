KNU president Gen Bo Mya told 500 guests, who attended his  67th birthday celebrations at his Manerplaw camp opposite Mae  Sariang district, that the Karen always wanted national  reconciliation but their three offers for peace talks had not  received any response from SLORC. Gen Bo Mya criticised other  minority groups for giving up their armed struggle against  Rangoon.    "The KNU will definitely conduct peace talks with SLORC if  the negotiations are on equal terms to sincerely obtain rights  and freedom in all economic, social and political fields for all  Burmese groups. The peace agreement reached separately with  various minority groups does not guarantee a true peace."    Gen Bo Mya, who leads the strongest anti-Rangoon minority  group, said the KNU would not join SLORC at the negotiating  table until Rangoon accepted all these conditions.    The truce talks, if agreed on, could be held in a third  country such as Thailand which cherished "the constructive  engagement" policy with SLORC, Gen Bo Mya said.</p>

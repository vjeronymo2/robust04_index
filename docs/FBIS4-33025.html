			<p>BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 26 May (EFE) -- Cuban exports to  Colombia increased by more than 1,600 percent in the first four  months of the year, from $1.2 million to $21 million, the  Colombian Foreign Trade Institute reported today. The institute  said Cuba was the country with the greatest increase in exports  to Colombia between January and April, as compared to the same  period last year. Cuba is followed by the Cayman Islands (800  percent), Poland (351 percent), and Sweden (210 percent).    Colombia and Cuba resumed their trade relations in 1990 and  their diplomatic ties last October following 12 years of broken  relations, which began in 1981 when President Julio Cesar Turbay  accused the Cuban Government of Fidel Castro of supporting  guerrilla groups. The Cuban Embassy in Colombia told EFE that  Colombia imports steel, salt for industrial use, generic  medicines, vaccines, and biotechnological products, from the  Caribbean island while Colombia sells Cuba textiles, electricity  cables, machinery, and coke, among other products. Colombia's  greatest increase in imports, by groups of countries or economic  blocs, came from the Andean Group countries (Bolivia, Peru,  Ecuador, and Venezuela) where Colombian purchases increased  20.82 percent followed by the European Union (EU) with 13.11  percent. Colombian imports during the first four months of the  year totalled $1.321 billion and its principal markets are the  United States and Venezuela, in that order.</p>

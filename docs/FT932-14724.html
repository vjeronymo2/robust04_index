			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Irish cut short-term interest rate again IRELAND'S Central Bank yesterday reduced its short term facility (STF) interest rate by half a percentage point to 9 per cent, the seventh reduction in the official rate in eight weeks, writes Tim Coone in Dublin. The STF is the rate which underpins wholesale money market rates and is now at its lowest level in four years. Wholesale money rates in Dublin soared to as high as 100 per cent during autumn's ERM currency crisis, as the Central Bank struggled to defend the punt against speculative attacks and exhausted its foreign currency reserves. The punt's devaluation in January however, and the easing of German interest rates, has since enabled the Central Bank substantially to rebuild reserves and therefore sharply to reduce interest rates in the Irish market.</p>

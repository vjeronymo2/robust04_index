			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets: New Zealand moves to a three-year high In a week in which most investors' eyes were firmly fixed on the dramatic events unfolding in Europe, there was still plenty of activity occurring elsewhere to excite interest. A sharp rise in the price of gold bullion lifted South Africa, and Mexico gained ground on good Telmex results, while firmness in Japan on optimism that the political impasse there might be settled contributed to a near 2 per cent local currency advance for the FT-Actuaries World index. New Zealand achieved the second biggest gain on the week, just behind Finland, with the local index recording a three-year peak in high volumes. Sentiment was encouraged by better than expected three-month figures from Telecom, with expectations of good full year figures. Analysts commented that most of the buying was domestic, but followed a trend elsewhere in the world, whereby investors are seeking out high yielding stocks and moving funds into equities. One of the few exceptions to an otherwise positive week in the global equity markets was Singapore. Since the beginning of the year the Straits Times Industrial index has advanced some 19 per cent; but from the all-time high set at the end of May, the index has receded some 5 per cent. Baring Securities, in a recent review of the market, says the current period of consolidation is to be expected given the high level of expectation that has been built into prices during the rally of the first half. With the interim reports season under way, Baring expects strong performances from the electronics and property sectors. With regard to the latter, the broker cautions that 'bullish prospects have largely been built into prices, which suggest that there is little scope for significant upward price movements, even though trading volume will remain strong because of abundant liquidity'.</p>

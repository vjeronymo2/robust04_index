			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THEATER;  </P> <P> FRESHNESS IN CENTER'S NEXT STAGE PACKAGE;  </P> <P> MOST OF THE MUSICALS IN NEXT SEASON'S BROADWAY SERIES ARE PROVEN HITS OF RECENT  VINTAGE.  </P> <P> Half full or half empty?  </P> <P> The question must be asked, now that the Orange County Performing Arts Center  has announced next season's Broadway Series of "A Chorus Line," "Grand Hotel,"  "Meet Me in St. Louis," "Les Miserables" and "Jerome Robbins' Broadway."  </P> <P> Is the programming better and fresher overall than past seasons, as Center  officials themselves are saying? Far and away, the answer is yes. There are no  warhorse revivals this time around, at least not the sort of golden oldies that  have lived longer and drained more blood than Dracula.  </P> <P> There is no "South Pacific" or "Can-Can," which were featured in the first  series; no "Camelot," which fortunately was canceled before it arrived for the  second, or "Anything Goes," which unfortunately wasn't canceled, and no "The  King and I," which may have set a record for tedium in the third.  </P> <P> Nor does the upcoming series bloat itself on such offerings as "The Music of  Andrew Lloyd Webber: A Concert" or "Elvis: A Musical Celebration," which for  all their popularity could no more be called Broadway musicals than the  big-band interludes during "Tonight Show" commercials.  </P> <P> Except for "Meet Me in St. Louis" (a period piece that cost a reported $6  million but closed in June after just seven months) and "A Chorus Line" (which  dates back to 1976), all the shows next season are proven Broadway hits of  recent vintage. That's three out of five. And "St. Louis" might have been a  hit, says its advocates, if not for the New York snobbery of key critics.  </P> <P> As to "A Chorus Line," there can be no quarrel with its historic significance  as a groundbreaking American musical nor with its merits as singular  entertainment. A production doesn't become the longest-running Broadway show  ever without giving real value. But the tour producer's notion that the show's  April closing in New York has created a wave of "Chorus Line" nostalgia in  Orange County -- as he claims has happened nationwide -- is open to debate.  </P> <P> All sorts of amateur troupes, always hungry for unreleased material, have  licensed the stage rights to the show ever since it closed. Generating audience  fervor may not be so easy, however. In Los Angeles, for instance, a critically  acclaimed professional production of "A Chorus Line" called it quits Sunday  because of mediocre ticket sales.  </P> <P> Maybe the purported nostalgia for a "farewell tour" of the authorized Broadway  version will materialize at the Center. Certainly, the Indianapolis-based  producer, Robert Young Associates, is counting on it. Young and others are  putting the show on the road for 50 weeks in a classic bus-and-truck operation  at a total cost of about $750,000.  </P> <P> "A Chorus Line" will shake the dust from its feet in Costa Mesa immediately  following a very hectic schedule: one week split between Pasadena and Santa  Barbara and another week split between Fresno and Albuquerque. With that kind  of mileage, can the performers be expected to duplicate the quality of the  Broadway original? Sure they can.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, "Grand Hotel" is slated for the Center after it plays for four weeks  at the Pantages Theatre in Los Angles, according to New York producer Marvin  Krauss. The arrival of "Jerome Robbins' Broadway" will follow a four-month run  in Los Angeles at the Shubert Theatre.  </P> <P> This is not to impugn the freshness of these shows, both of which are still on  Broadway and both of which are touring for the first time. It is merely a  reminder that you can catch them sooner than later, if freshness is a paramount  concern and you don't mind taking a drive.  </P> <P> In fact, that drive may be the only way to guarantee seeing two of the  Tony-winning performances from the original Robbins show, because both  performers are signed for the Los Angeles production but have not been signed  yet for the rest of the tour. Given the wear and tear of the road, they might  well choose to do other things by the time the show gets to the Center.  </P> <P> Which brings us to the matter of touting the number of Tonys earned by the  original productions. "Collectively, these five musicals have won 28 Tony  Awards," Center president Thomas R. Kendrick pointed out last week in an  interview. "And they've had about twice that many nominations."  </P> <P> Absolutely true. But all Tonys do not carry equally translatable weight for  touring productions. Winning performers who don't go on the road with a show  obviously can't be counted, while Tonys in technical categories such as set and  lighting, which can only be approximated on the road, ought not to count as  much as those for more substantive categories such as best score.  </P> <P> Of the five shows coming to the Center, just two -- "Les Miz" and "A Chorus  Line" -- won Tonys for their scores. Ironically, they're also the least fresh.  ("Les Miz" opened on Broadway in 1987 and played for 14 months in Los Angeles.)  By the same token, they're also the only two with Tonys for best book, another  substantive category with durable value.  </P> <P> On the other hand, Tommy Tune won two Tonys for "Grand Hotel" this year -- best  choreography and best direction -- and he will oversee the road production.  Similarly, Jerome Robbins, who won for best direction of "Jerome Robbins'  Broadway" last year, will also oversee his road show. Both men have reputations  as sticklers for quality and can be expected to put their artistic stamp on  these outings.  </P> <P> As for "Meet Me in St. Louis," it is harder to predict what the quality is  likely to be. The show, which cost a reported $6 million on Broadway, got four  Tony nominations this year, all in substantive categories: best musical, score,  book and choreography. But it didn't win in any of them. And the lavish  costumes and opulent scenery came in for more praise than the musical itself,  despite the nominations.  </P> <P> The "St. Louis" road production, which is currently being assembled and has yet  to be cast, will include the original costumes and props. But the size of the  set -- which featured fireworks, an ice-skating rink and a clanging trolley car  on Broadway -- will probably be cut down.  </P> <P> Finally, it should be noted that the Center won't have produced any of these  shows, no matter how mightily it may strive to make it appear otherwise. When  Kendrick calls last season's "Gypsy" revival "our production" -- as he did  recently in a sales letter to tens of thousands of potential subscribers -- it  is wishful thinking. And misleading.  </P> <P> The Center had no more to do with producing that show, which went on to become  a Broadway smash, than you or I did. The Center merely booked it, for which it  deserves all due credit, but no more.  </P></p>

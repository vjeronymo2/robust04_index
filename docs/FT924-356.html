			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / A fashionable headache: Dominic Lawson says medical theories of the day often prove to be a pain A HUNDRED years ago, a fashionable doctor of the day by the name of Vogel burst into print on what happens to little boys who play with themselves. They become, said the good doctor, 'visibly emaciated and anaemic, remain backward in their bodily and mental development; they develop an apathetic expression of the countenance and flaccid muscles. . . the gait becomes unsteady and lumbersome and the knees fall inward'. Dr Vogel wrote with an unmistakeable air of authority. He knew he was right. Nowadays we know - I hope - that he was wrong. But it is all a matter of fashion. In the 1890s, high Victorian puritanism was sufficiently ingrained that rational men in rational pursuits, such as the medical profession claims to be, were driven to prove its scientific validity. It is one of the features of a fashionable morality that its exponents demand to be thought not merely good, but also right. The liberal moralists who have dominated education and the social sciences for most of my lifetime were every bit as dogmatic as Dr Vogel, and no less absurd in their lack of respect for evidence. Their insistence that intelligence could not be partly inherited was but one example; another was their refusal to admit that the child of a one-parent family was starting life with something of a handicap, and not just a financial one. I use the past tense to talk of these attitudes because, after 30 years, they are on the wane. The reason is simply that they had been long enough in vogue to become visibly responsible for the dire consequences of their fashionability. None the less, it still comes as something of a shock to read in a medical scientific textbook of the 1950s, The Normal Child, that 'one-parent families are harmful to the child, and for this reason the adoption of her illegitimate child by a mother is not to be encouraged. There are commonly associated economic and social problems with housing difficulties'. No messing about there by Doctor Ronald Illingworth MD,FRCP,DPH,DCH, whose book is a joy and an education to read. I ought perhaps to confess that I would not normally be reading 40-year-old paediatric textbooks. But shortly I am due to become a father, and like most men in that interesting condition at one remove, I have been hoovering up the available literature, preferably in second-hand bookshops. For you will not find the splendid Doctor Illingworth weighing down the shelves of shiny new baby books in WH Smith. No. Instead, you will find Dr Miriam Stoppard, who is absolutely high fashion. Dr Stoppard's best-selling New Pregnancy and Birth Book advises its readers of the advantages of yogic childbirth. The yogic mother-to-be, says Dr Stoppard, 'may use meditation and chanting and the support of yoga groups' spiritual participation. . . yogic education helps in the belief that a woman has the ability to create or destroy her own pain and joy during birth'. There are limits to medical hippiedom: Dr Stoppard tells her readers sternly that they 'should refrain from smoking marijuana before they decide to conceive'. Dr Stoppard is a great believer in 'bonding'. This is a word which does not occur in Doctor Illingworth's great tome. Dr Stoppard admits that 'it is difficult to describe what bonding is', but, as I understand her, bonding is mother and child staring at each other intently for the first 45 minutes of the baby's life. Common sense would suggest that this is rewarding for the mother but a matter to be instantly forgotten by the stunned newborn. Dr Stoppard, however, claims that 'research showed that, at the age of five years, the children who had had extended contact with their parents immediately after delivery scored higher in intelligence tests'. Bonding is, of course, a very fashionable concept: no one really knows what they are talking about, but they know they are doing the right thing. Alas for them, a book is to be published next month in America called The Myth of Mother/Infant Bonding. According to those who have read the proofs, the book comprehensively debunks the supposed medical evidence that bonding has a quantifiably positive effect on the infant: it just makes the mother feel good, that is all. Thus ends another fashion in the wacky world of pseudo-medicine. Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator</p>

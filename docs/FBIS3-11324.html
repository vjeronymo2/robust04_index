The president made this announcement after signing the law  in  the Ayacucho room, Miraflores Palace. Ministers of the Executive  Cabinet; members of the board of directors of the national  Congress, represented by Eduardo Gomez Tamayo and Carmelo  Lauria, president and vice president, respectively; chiefs of  the Convergence Party, Movement Toward Socialism, Democratic  Action, and Christian Democratic Party parliamentary wings; Jose  Baouza Izquierdo, president of the National Banking Board; and  deputies and senators who are members of the finance commissions  of the legislative branch were present for the signing. Ruth de  Krivoy, president of the Central Bank of Venezuela; Deputy  Walter Marquez, vice president of the commission investigating  the Banco Latino case; and Gustavo Roosen, president of the  Banco Latino intervention board, were also present.    The head of state said the national government will  immediately submit a bill to the legislative chambers for  partial reforms to the law "because the government believes some  of the approved provisions show that, given the lack of time and  the praiseworthy urgency with which Congress passed the bill,  they were not properly studied regarding the possible  consequences some of the norms might have. Instead of helping to  stabilize the Venezuelan financial system, which is what  everyone is worried about, the bill could prevent achieving this  goal."    Caldera said he is sure the atmosphere of dialogue and  cooperation, which has prevailed among the state branches in  connection with the bill, will allow the government to receive  proposals relating to this matter. He said the promulgation of  the law is encouraging for those who have watched with anguish  their personal situation in connection with the Banco Latino  crisis. "I have not hesitated to call this crisis a veritable  cataclysm, the extent of which has surpassed what was initially  calculated when President Ramon J. Velasquez decreed the bank's  intervention." The president said the action is the first step  in the so-called Solidarity Pledge, in which all public and  private sector organizations are striving together to counter  this critical, difficult, and complex situation.    Gustavo Tarre Briceno, chairman of the Chamber of Deputies'  Finance Committee, referred to the law's partial reforms and  said it deals with the "most urgent things," including a Public  Credit Law for 400 billion bolivares to finance the Emergency  Law provisions. The bill, however, will be reviewed calmly with  the assurance that the account holders' and depositors'  emergency has been met and modifications can be made in a more  calm fashion.    Congress President Eduardo Gomez Tamayo said he will wait  until the government proposals are analyzed before he decides to  declare the partial reforms bill a constitutional emergency.  Gustavo Roosen, chairman of Banco Latino's Board of Trustees,  said several of the articles are questionable because they make  the board's work difficult.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> TTMA stated there is little possibility of corrosion occurring in the void space of any tank, except on carbon steel cargo tanks in corrosive service. TTMA recommended that the connecting structure on self-supporting cargo tanks be thickness tested every two years for signs of corrosion. Several other commenters supported TTMA's comments. One commenter also suggested that the wording be revised to eliminate reference to the inspection opening but continue to provide for a drain. The commenter stated that the minimum acceptable size of any drain opening should be 0.5 inches diameter, which is large enough to insert a borescope or equivalent device.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RSPA agrees with commenters that there has been no evidence of corrosion occurring in the void space of any tank, except a carbon steel cargo tank in corrosive service. Corrosion in connecting spaces has serious structural implications for self-supporting cargo tanks. The failure reported in the NTSB investigative report, containing recommendation H&hyph;83&hyph;30, involved a carbon steel MC 312 cargo tank semi-trailer carrying hydrochloric acid; the failure occurred due to severe corrosion in the tank shell under a circumferential reinforcing ring. Therefore, paragraph (i)(2) is revised to require that the connecting structure in a carbon steel, self-supporting multi-tank cargo tank motor vehicle must have a single drain of at least 1.0 inch diameter, or two or more drains of at least 0.5 inches diameter, 6 inches apart, one of which is located on the bottom centerline. In addition, &sect;180.407(i) is revised to require thickness testing of these areas as suggested by TTMA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RSPA believes that NTSB recommendation H&hyph;83&hyph;30, which calls for periodic external visual inspection of cargo tank surfaces obscured by appurtenances and structural attachments, is adequately addressed in current &sect;180.407(d). Paragraph (d) requires that a periodic external visual inspection must be conducted of all major appurtenances and structural attachments on a cargo tank to detect signs of corrosion or damage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 178.345&hyph;3 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commenters expressed concern over the lack of flexibility in calculating compressive stresses for non-ASME DOT 400-series cargo tanks. They recommended that RSPA provide alternatives to ASME Code Section VIII, Division 1 UG&hyph;23(b) for calculating the maximum allowable compressive buckling stress in tank walls for low pressure cargo tanks. The static design and construction of all DOT 400-series cargo tanks must be in accordance with Section VIII of the ASME Code. Any DOT 400-series cargo tank which is required to be certified to the ASME Code also must be designed in accordance with the Code's requirements for dynamic loading, including UG&hyph;23(b). This applies to DOT 407 cargo tanks with a MAWP greater than 35 psig and each tank designed to be loaded by vacuum, and to DOT 412 cargo tanks having a MAWP greater than 15 psig.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TTMA stated manufacturers believe the requirements in &sect;178.345&hyph;3(b) should be modified to allow several methods of analysis as appropriate for the cargo tank under consideration. Using the methods outlined in the ASME Code produces lower allowable compressive stress values, resulting in substantially thicker sheets for the DOT 400-series tanks as compared with the MC 300-series cargo tanks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

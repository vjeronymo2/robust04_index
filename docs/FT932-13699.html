			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Letter: Not just commercially skilled Sir, In his letter, 'Technology crucial to debate on UK's economic renaissance' (April 15), Professor Ian Mackintosh maintains that the 'Japanese (and other Asian) industrial economies have risen from scratch to giddy heights largely on the skilful commercialisation of electronic goodies for the home and the office'. Behind 'skilful commercialisation' lies product and process technology of a high order. Moreover, beyond the 'electronic goodies' Japan is a world leader in electronics and electronic engineering, including semiconductors, computers and telecommunications. It stands on the eve of producing the 256-megabit DRAM tran- sistor. Professor Mackintosh could make a stronger case.

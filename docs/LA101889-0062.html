			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SYMPHONY, MUSICIANS OK CONTRACT  </P> <P> San Diego Symphony officials announced Tuesday that orchestra management and  players have a new two-year contract to replace the contract that expired on  Sept. 30. The symphony's executive board approved the new contract Monday  night, after a positive vote by the players last Thursday. The contract  provides for modest increases in the players' weekly base salary and adds one  more week of performance in the contract's second year.  </P> <P> Joe Pallazola, president of the American Federation of Musicians, Local 325,  stated that the union was satisfied with the new contract, although a typical  agreement is a three-year contract.  </P> <P> "We settled for a two-year contract in the hope that in three years, management  will be in a better position to begin to compete with the major orchestras,"  Pallazola said.  </P> <P> The first year of the new contract provides a weekly base salary of $660, which  will increase to $700 per week the second year.KENNETH HERMAN  </P></p>

			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / International Company News: US 'warehouse clubs' in deal to merge operations A MERGER was announced yesterday between two of the largest operators of 'warehouse clubs' in the US. San Diego-based Price Company, which pioneered the highly-successful retail concept, and Costco, with headquarters at Kirkland, near Seattle, announced yesterday that they planned to combine their operations in a new company called Price/Costco. It will take in 195 membership warehouses - huge out-of-town retail barns, which sell merchandise at rock-bottom prices - in three countries. Annual sales will stand at around Dollars 16bn. Both have disclosed plans to open warehouse club outlets in the UK - with Price Club setting up a joint venture with Littlewoods. Under the deal, shares in the new company will be issued on the basis of 2.13 shares for each Price Company share, and one share for each Costco share. Price Company shareholders will own about 48 per cent of the new merged group, while Costco shareholders, who include France's Carrefour, will have 52 per cent. Price shares soared Dollars 5 3/4 to Dollars 38 on the news, while Costco gained Dollars 1 3/4 to close at Dollars 18 3/4 . Top positions at the merged company will be filled by executives from both companies, and the Price/Costco board will comprise an equal number of directors. There will be home offices in both San Diego and Kirkland, although the information and accounting systems will be centred in the former city, and buying and merchandising in the latter. The warehouse club movement has been one of the most dynamic elements in the US retail sector in the recent years, where sales reached around Dollars 33bn in 1992. However, sales have slowed sharply recently, and analysts have noted that certain geographical markets were over-crowded. Accordingly, there have been predictions of consolidations. Last month, Wal-Mart Stores, the largest US operator of warehouse clubs through its Sams Club chain, said it was buying 14 outlets from Kmart, the number two operator via the Pace Membership Warehouses. Costco and Price Company rank third and fourth respectively, in terms of outlets operated.</p>

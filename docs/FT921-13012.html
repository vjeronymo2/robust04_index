			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Oil price One of the stranger arguments doing the rounds in the oil market is that Saudi Arabia is happy with low crude prices because it wants to see President Bush re-elected - the theory being that cheap oil will help stimulate the US economy in time for November's election. Given that most oil shares have been struggling to overcome the effects of the depressed crude price, it is perhaps worth considering a different view of Saudi thinking. The fact that the Saudis and the United Arab Emirates joined several Opec colleagues and voluntarily cut their production two days ago sits oddly with the notion that they want to keep prices below Dollars 18 per barrel, let alone allow them to move even lower. The Saudi government will be acutely aware that every Dollars 1 off the oil price reduces its revenues by Dollars 2.5bn at a time when the country is running a budget deficit estimated at Dollars 8bn this year. There must be cheaper ways to help Mr Bush. There is the additional consideration of the Saudis' role in the Middle East after the Gulf war and the importance of establishing good relations with Iran. Finally, the Saudis are doubtless aware a lengthy period of weak oil prices could increase the danger of consumer countries slapping on additional taxes to satisfy their consciences over the environment. The forthcoming Opec meeting should resolve the argument, but the case for slightly higher oil prices looks the stronger.</p>

			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Leaders emerge in race for ID-card business THORN Secure Systems, part of Thorn-EMI, and Electronic Data Systems, the information technology subsidiary of General Motors, are the front-runners to introduce a system of identity cards for the country's 20m social security claimants. Government officials said yesterday that an identity card system was likely to be introduced after an investigation of how to reduce fraud in the social security budget. The investigation, being overseen by the government efficiency unit, is expected to be completed in the next few weeks. Both Thorn and EDS have been consulted during the investigation. It is estimated that a computerised anti-fraud system would cost more than Pounds 100m, but could lead to annual savings of at least Pounds 800m in the social security budget. Officials estimate the savings would come from the near-elimination of three kinds of fraud: use of stolen benefit books, use of forged books and claiming under a variety of names. A possible communications infrastructure for the system already exists. Racal Network Systems runs a network linking 40 government departments, but which has 'walls' between departments. It also links the 600 or so Department of Social Security offices throughout the country. The main expense would be additional hardware. An automatic telling machine in every DSS office at about Pounds 100,000 each would mean a total cost of Pounds 60m. However, officials say the preferred scheme will probably involve installing simple point-of-payments machines in post offices. These operate like point-of-sale machines in supermarkets and would have the advantage of ensuring that sub-post offices in villages do not become redundant because of the existence of an automated teller machines in the street. Whether the DSS will install a machine in all 12,000 sub-post offices or only in the 6,000 main ones has not been decided. Another important consideration in choosing the system is the concerns of civil rights lobby groups that individual privacy may be at risk. Officials say that technology exists to produce the kind of identity card that would overcome civil liberty fears. Claimants could have a 'hand scan' and then the shape of the hand would be stored electronically, together with relevant social security data, on a magnetic stripe on a swipe card of the kind used by banks. When claimants collected benefits or pensions, they would have their hands 'read' by a machine to verify identity. Mr Brian Maitland Reynell, government services director of EDS, said trials in the US had shown that hand scans could be devised that could not be used by the police for criminal identification purposes, alleviating some of the civil liberties concerns. His company would be able to set up the entire system for the government. He said cost would depend on how much hardware was needed. 'The cost would certainly be less than the potential savings,' he said. Nor would EDS actually make the cards. There are a number of companies in Britain capable of doing this, such as McCorquodale Card Technology, Datacard and De La Rue. McCorquodale claims to have the largest share of an annual UK market of about 250m cards. Swipe cards cost between Pounds 1 and Pounds 5 to manufacture. Thorn Secure System has the relevant technology to compete with EDS, either through watermarks on magnetic strips on swipe cards or through fingerprinting, a variant of the hand scan. Watermark magnetics is a technique developed by Thorn and is a sophisticated version of the watermarking used on bank notes. Estimates of the total size of the fraud range from Pounds 1bn to Pounds 5bn. In Australia, the only country where there has been a detailed study of social security fraud, it was estimated that the level of fraud ranged between 5 per cent and 15 per cent of total payments. British officials base their estimates on the 5 per cent level. That would mean fraud of Pounds 3bn to Pounds 4bn, of which a quarter, or more than Pounds 800m, is thought to stem from stolen benefit books, forged books and multiple identity fraud. The much harder to detect fraud of moonlighting - claiming benefits while working - could account for a substantial part of the rest. If there was a desire to attack this kind of fraud it would probably require the introduction of the more sophisticated smart cards that contain a microchip and could hold far larger amounts of updateable information about the private circumstances of beneficiaries, including their work and income. The government appears reluctant to go down this route because of the implications for civil liberties.</p>

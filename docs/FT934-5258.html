			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (29): What about the workers? THE SOCIAL DIMENSION: EMPLOYMENT POLICY IN THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY by Michael Gold (editor) Macmillan, Pounds 13.99 276 pages Underlying the debate about European-wide employment regulation lie a series of controversial assumptions about the relationship between labour market systems and economic performance. The fundamental assumption, shared by most of the Christian and Social Democrats who run the European Commission, is that the relative economic success of northern European countries such as Germany and Holland has been achieved because of, not in spite of, their systems of labour regulation and integration. This view is challenged by many of Europe's economists as well as most of the British Conservative party, who view such arrangements as hopelessly inflexible. Even an open-minded Conservative who did accept that the strong voice of German labour, tempered by strict legal restraints, has contributed to high productivity and wage discipline in Germany, would still reject such a model for Britain. Britain, the argument might run, has always had an open, volatile economy and therefore needs a flexible 'hire and fire' labour market, especially if it is to compensate for low labour mobility and low educational standards. To a surprising extent this 'horses for courses' argument is now accepted by the EC, as Michael Gold recognises in his introductory essay to The Social Dimension. The 'Germanic' model of industrial relations no longer directly inspires EU employment legislation as it did in the late 1970s when workers on company boards was first proposed. Despite British complaints that Brussels is trying to impose a 'continental' model of labour regulation on the UK, the Commission is now far more sensitive to the subsidiarity argument in national labour markets. Since the late 1980s the argument for Europe-wide legislation has shifted. At one level it has become more political - the single market has given capital new advantages, so there must be something for labour too, hence the 1989 Social Chapter. But as Europe's economies have become more integrated, the primary concern has been to prevent a downward spiral of competition over labour conditions  -so-called 'social dumping'. There is little hard evidence that such dumping is on the increase, but it is a possibility as barriers fall. These essays do not analyse such assumptions in depth. Essentially they provide a textbook describing the minutae of institutions and existing legislation, especially in the three key areas where the EU's minimum standards really do make a difference to working life: health and safety, equal pay and redundancies. The essays offer a useful historical perspective. Gold, for example, points out that the arguments between neo-liberals and regulators go back to Article 117 of the original Treaty of Rome. The Article argued that the condition of labour would improve spontaneously, encouraging the harmonisation of 'social systems' as a result of the common market. The same Article argued, however, that regulation and 'administrative action' was required to ensure those outcomes. Finally, although much of the book's technical detail will still be relevant in 10 years time, it was completed before the Maastricht Treaty was ratified, so it already feels out of date.</p>

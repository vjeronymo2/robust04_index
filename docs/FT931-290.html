			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Rips in the employment featherbed: Christopher Parkes on how German management has found that traditional ways of cutting payroll costs are simply not enough to counter the pressures of recession GERMAN trade unions, after tamely accepting wage increases barely big enough to cover inflation, have been watching, mute, as the toll of recession on the west German workforce has mounted. Hundreds of thousands of jobs have been marked for the axe: some 300,000 in the motor industry alone. Now, after careful examination of pay and conditions contracts, management has started ripping away at the very fabric of Germany's employment featherbed. Bosch, the electrical, electronics and components maker, for example, told its domestic workforce that a 3 per cent pay increase due on April 1 will be paid only on the basic rate. The calculation will exclude all the other in-house bonuses, allowances, shift premiums, canteen subsidies and payments for health care and spa cures hitherto included. Such 'social' cuts were unprecedented, the IG Metall engineering union said. Then the engineering employers' association in the state of Hesse imposed similar restrictions on its 340,000 workers, raising 'breach of contract' charges. These new tactics demonstrate in the first instance that traditional ways of reducing payroll costs - early retirement, natural wastage and state-subsidised short-time working - are no longer enough to counter the pressure of recession. Forced redundancies are legally fraught and costly, and virtually unknown in Germany. Bosch calculates its move will save it DM250m (Pounds 106m) in a full year. But by squeezing out further savings through the manipulation of pay and conditions agreements, the employers are pressing dangerously close to the limits of trade union tolerance. Despite demonstrations against the acceleration in the already-established run-down of the western steel industry, the unions' reaction so far to massive rationalisation in key sectors such as vehicle-building, plant engineering, machine tools and chemicals, has been distinctly restrained. It demonstrates widespread acceptance of managements' argument that recession, coupled with the need for western German industry to regain international competitiveness, make pay restraint and workforce reductions unavoidable. However, Germany's biggest union, IG Metall, in particular believes industry is taking advantage of the slump to further its long-term aim of undermining the unions' greatest guarantee of influence: the collective bargaining system. Thus IG Metall has called protest strikes throughout eastern Germany this week. Mr Franz Steinkuhler, the union's president, has made his stand on the basis of an existing 'untouchable' agreement under which all eastern German engineers should gain pay parity with their western colleagues by next spring. Instead of the 26 per cent rise due next month, Gesamtmetall, the federal employers' association, is sticking to its unilaterally revised 9 per cent offer - equivalent to the expected inflation rate in the former GDR, a real award of nil. Standing alone (other unions including IG Chemie, representing chemicals workers, and and non-organised employees have already accepted 9 per cent or less) Mr Steinkuhler says he is fighting for justice, jobs, and to keep essential skills in the east. As unemployment in the former GDR hovers around 15 per cent, 10,000 people are moving to the west each month. Without a supply of skills, he asks, where is the incentive to invest? Managers in the west put the question differently and apply it to the whole of Germany. Where is the investment incentive in an economy burdened with the highest labour costs and most inflexible working practices in the world? Their answer is implied in an acceleration in the shift of manufacturing capacity and jobs abroad, where wage costs are lower and unions less hide-bound. Over the years, Germany's main unions have engineered a rigid network of 'regional' pay agreements in which a deal in high-tech, highly prosperous Baden-Wurttemberg, for example, would be taken as the model for comparable workers all over Germany. Thus, regional basic pay differentials in metal-working of 15 per cent 20 years ago have been eroded to 2 per cent today, regardless of differences in living costs or labour market conditions. The strain of keeping pace has recently prompted associations representing medium-sized businesses to threaten to withdraw from the employers' associations and negotiate independently. In the strongest reaction so far, IBM Deutschland last year pulled out of the system and now conducts most of its own wage negotiations. According to the federal labour office, there are now more than 2,000 plant-level agreements operating in the west. Meanwhile, the DGB trade union congress is in disarray. Its negligible contribution to the recent solidarity pact - a package of measures to support economic recovery in the east - amply demonstrated its lack of authority. Its 17 member unions are at war among themselves, especially those in pursuit of elusive white-collar subscriptions. Meanwhile, membership continues to fall, and the union voice is becoming less and less representative of the workforce as a whole. Even before the current recession, three quarters of trade union members in the west were blue-collar workers, while more than 60 per cent of the working population was earning its living in services or from self-employment. It is abundantly clear that the post-war German economic miracle is not going to be repeated in the former GDR; the few remaining manufacturing jobs in the east are under threat, and many IG Metall members openly admit that it is impossible to justify a 26 per cent pay increase in current conditions. Yet Mr Steinkuhler is standing fast in a position which is at best isolated and at worst untenable. He is gambling on the employers' appreciating that it is in no-one's interests to humble him now. Senior executives agree that despite their drawbacks, the trade unions must remain as key and committed contributors to the consensus-building process which has underpinned Germany's post-war success and is now helping steer industry through a wholesale restructuring. As the protest strikes deadline approached, signs emerged of a way out of the impasse when several eastern companies offered in-house deals of up to 15 per cent. The offers bore all the hallmarks of compromise at least partly true to German tradition. But at least Mr Steinkuhler may enjoy the consolation of knowing that they would not have been made at all if he had not stuck his neck out, and that the workers benefiting will appreciate that they have IG Metall to thank, and stay in the union.</p>

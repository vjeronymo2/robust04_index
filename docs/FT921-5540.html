			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: BP strengthens Statoil link BRITISH PETROLEUM is taking its strategic alliance with Statoil a stage further by selling a 45 per cent stake in a North Sea gas field to the Norwegian state oil company. BP Exploration announced yesterday that it had agreed to sell the stake in the Hyde field in the southern sector of the North Sea for an undisclosed sum. BP already has an agreement with Statoil covering gas marketing in the UK, technical research and exploration and selected oil provinces. This includes a three-way joint venture agreement with Statoil and Norsk Hydro to market Norwegian gas into the UK industrial market, a move that was recently given special approval from the UK government. BP also said yesterday that it will shortly begin development of the Hyde field, with production scheduled to start in the fourth quarter of next year. The cost of developing the Hyde field is expected to be in the region of Pounds 65m. Both the sale of the stake to Statoil and the commencement of development will require an official go-ahead. The Hyde field lies 40 miles east of Humberside in 100 feet of water and it contains an estimated 135bn cubic feet of gas. It straddles four blocks. But more than 97 per cent of the reserves are thought to be in a block held 100 per cent by BP, the company said. According to BP, the field was long considered uneconomical but it had been transformed into a profitable prospect by means of innovative thinking and by new partnership arrangements that would greatly reduce costs. It is also believed that these techniques may subsequently be applied successfully to many other smaller fields in the North Sea. To develop Hyde, BP has entered into partnerships with two contractors, UIE Scotland, based on Clydeside, and Glasgow engineers Kvaerner H&amp;G Offshore, under which cost savings would be shared. BP said that this arrangement would encourage a more cost effective approach among teams engaged on the project. Hyde will be developed using a small unmanned steel platform. The gas will be produced from three pre-drilled horizontal wells and transported via a new seven mile pipeline to the existing West Sole system for piping ashore. BP said that a sales agreement for Hyde gas was currently being negotiated and that its details would be announced in due course.</p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Radical council shake-up proposed for East Anglia East Anglian local government should be radically reorganised with eight new unitary authorities replacing Norfolk and Suffolk county councils and the area's 14 district councils, the Local Government Commission said yesterday. Under the proposals, Norwich and Ipswich would become self-governing cities. Total costs could be as high as Pounds 37m, according to the commission, while the annual savings might be as little as Pounds 1m. King's Lynn and West Norfolk District Council would become a unitary authority within its existing boundaries. There would be five mergers: Great Yarmouth in Norfolk with Waveney in Suffolk; North Norfolk and Broadland councils; Breckland with South Norfolk; Forest Heath, St Edmudsbury and the western parts of Mid Suffolk and Babergh would become West Suffolk; and Suffolk Coastal with the eastern parts of Mid Suffolk and Babergh would form East Suffolk. The commission believes the only viable alternative to this ambitious system would be to leave the structure unchanged, with Norwich and Ipswich remaining as district councils within larger counties. The commission believes that the second option is supported by 'the majority of local town and parish councils'. The total number of mainland county councils which the commission has recommended for abolition so far is 22. However, in 13 cases it has also suggested the two-tier system as an alternative. All households in the counties concerned have been sent leaflets in a consultation exercise which will continue until September. If this reveals support for the two-tier system, the commission could rule out reorganisation. Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, who is a Suffolk MP, has said he supports unitary councils because they allow greater accountability, and has already asked the commission to review again three counties where it has recommended keeping the two-tier system.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Chamber of Deputies President Jorge Schaulsohn  stated that the Army should order an internal investigation to  determine who is responsible for the institution deliberating on  comments by Deputy Jaime Naranjo. Naranjo had stated that the  Army commander in chief [General Augusto Pinochet] should resign.    A few days ago Socialist Deputy Jaime Naranjo stated that  the  protests over the Army commander's trip to Europe prove that,  quote, his crimes have not been forgotten, unquote. Naranjo  added that Gen. Pinochet must resign.    Press reports stated that the Army was annoyed by Naranjo's  comments, which it regards as seditious. When asked about the  issue, Army spokesmen said the institution is annoyed by the  deputy's comments because it believes he used inappropriate  language against Gen. Pinochet. The Army added that all this  prompted Army Deputy Commander General Jorge Lucar to call a  meeting of Army generals to assess Naranjo's comments as well as  the media coverage of Gen. Pinochet's tour.    The Chamber of Deputies president, in turn, said it will not  tolerate any interference in the legislators' activities and  announced that he will submit a request to the defense minister  to clarify the case.    [Begin Schaulsohn recording] I believe it is completely  unacceptable that Armed Forces members deliberate and voice  their opinion on legislators' performance. If the  aforementioned meeting really took place and the comments really  were made, they are openly violating the Constitution that  establishes that our Armed Forces should not be involved in  politics and expressly prohibits them from deliberating. The  Army should order an investigation within the force to determine  who was responsible for this political deliberation. [end  recording]    The subject also was discussed by the Socialist and National  Renewal Parties' presidents and by Deputy Naranjo himself.    [Begin recording] [Naranjo] I do not think this problem only  involves Deputy Naranjo because the Chamber of Deputies on 8  June, with the support of the National Renewal Party [RN],  deemed it necessary to check Gen. Pinochet's trip.    [Socialist Party President Camilo Escalona recording] To be  quite frank, the Socialist Party is not responsible for Gen.  Pinochet acting like a teenager in Europe.    [RN President Andres Allamand recording] We are in favor of  complete honesty. Therefore, likewise we fully support  clarifying what happened in Codelco [Copper Corporation]; we  also are all for the Chamber of Deputies receiving all the  information regarding this trip abroad that, moreover, was  authorized by the government. We always have upheld honesty.  But disclosing information on this trip has nothing to do with  the hideous and usually rude language with which Deputy Naranjo  refers to the Army commander. [end recording]    Gen. Pinochet has been in Switzerland for the past three  days. His presence in Lucerne has prompted protest in political  circles. Swiss Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti stated that there  is deep unrest in his country due to the Chilean military  officer's visit.    It was leaked that Gen. Pinochet also might travel to  England  or Brazil, and that he is scheduled to return to Chile after 20  June.</p>

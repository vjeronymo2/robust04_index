			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow at record high on hopes for Nafta vote Wall Street AFTER A lacklustre start, blue chip stocks roared into record territory yesterday as expectations that Congress would approve Nafta in today's crucial vote helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average close above 3,700 for the first time, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Industrial Average was 33.25 stronger at 3,710.77 and the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 up 2.99 at 466.74. Secondary indices, however, fared less well, with the American SE composite index finishing down 3.09 at 474.73 and the Nasdaq composite 0.76 lower at 771.69. New York SE volume came to 304m shares. Trading was initially hampered by uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the House of Representatives' vote (due some time tonight) on the North American Free Trade Agreement. The markets view passage of Nafta as bullish for equities - free trade should promote exports and economic growth, say economists - but remain concerned that a majority of House members may vote against the treaty on the grounds that it will lead to a loss of US jobs to Mexico. Both sides claimed yesterday that they had enough votes for victory, but reports late in the day that President Clinton had locked up enough votes to ensure Nafta passes into law provided stocks with a strong lift in the final hour of trading. The gains were achieved in spite of further declines in bond prices, which pushed the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond up to 6.16 per cent and fuelled fears that long-term interest rates may be on the rise. Telefonos de Mexico, the market's biggest 'Nafta play', continued to be buffeted by the uncertainty surrounding the treaty's fortunes. After posting declines in the previous two trading days, Telmex yesterday rebounded Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 56 7/8 in volume of 8m shares. Among leading Dow stocks, General Electric climbed Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 96 3/8 , IBM added Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 52 3/4 and General Motors rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 52 3/4 . General Motors class 'E' shares, however, fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 29 as investors reacted to news that the company is considering using 185m of the shares to fund its pension liability if it receives the go-ahead of regulators. Much of the early weakness in the Dow was attributable to a sharp decline in Caterpillar shares, which lost Dollars 3 to Dollars 86 7/8 before rallying to end a net Dollars 1 1/8 down at Dollars 88 3/4 . The damage was inflicted by a downgrade and lowered earnings forecast by broking house Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. Canada THE Toronto market retreated to a sharply lower close as today's US vote on Nafta and tumbling natural resource shares weighed on confidence. The TSE 300 composite index dropped 24.6 to 4,257.2, while trading volume totalled 83.2m shares valued at CDollars 777m.</p>

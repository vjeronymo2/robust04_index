			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Stress 'not just bosses' disease' JOB STRESS is at least as high among blue-collar workers as it is among executives, the annual occupational psychology conference of the British Psychological Society was told yesterday. A study of stress and sickness absence among managers and shopfloor workers at Scottish and Newcastle Breweries in Edinburgh showed that job stress was not just a 'bosses' disease', Dr Rosalind Bramwell and Professor Cary Cooper from the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology told the conference. Prof Cooper said that companies were often mistakenly concentrating on white-collar groups when it came to measures to reduce stress. Failure to recognise stress among manual groups 'must be costing British industry a fortune in lost working days', he said. The study found that shopfloor workers were taking 2 1/2 times as many days off sick compared as their managerial colleagues. Much of the time off could be linked to stress arising from a sense of being poorly valued, said the researchers. Questionnaires were sent to more than 600 employees, from directors to clerical workers and draymen. Rates of sickness absence were taken from the brewery's records. A warning to companies to beware of 'cowboy' publishers of personality and aptitude tests was made at the conference by Dr Rob Feltham, director of test publishers ASE. Tests at the 'cheap and dirty end' of the market ran the risk of being biased against, for example, Asian and Afro-Caribbean job applicants, he said.</p>

			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / French franc makes comeback: Paris is relieved at the recovery but questions have been raised The French franc is back. For the first time since the summer's currency crisis it has returned to the narrow trading bands which formed the basis of the European exchange rate mechanism before the assault from the foreign exchange markets. The crisis forced a widening of the fluctuation bands around each currency's central rate from 2.25 per cent to 15 per cent and broke the close link between the franc and the D-Mark. But on Wednesday, after a period of gathering strength, the French currency breached its previous floor rate of FFr3.4305 to the D-Mark. It has since traded at around FFr3.4250. The rise of the franc has been greeted with quiet satisfaction in France's financial ministries. But it raises several questions; from the reasons for the rise, to the implications for monetary policy should the franc retain its vigour. For French government officials, the franc's fortunes require little explanation. They have always said the franc's rate within the ERM is justified by economic fundamentals. They point to France's low inflation rate, which stands at an annual rate of just over 2 per cent, and the competitiveness of French industry, which will contribute to a trade surplus forecast to reach FFr70bn (Pounds 8bn) this year. Private-sector economists agree that economic factors are underpinning the franc. But they add that the fundamentals have become influential only as a result of the collapse of the old exchange rate system. 'In the world of narrow bands what mattered was the need to keep interest rates high to stay pegged to the D-Mark,' says Mr Paul Chertkow, head of currency research at UBS in London. 'With 15 per cent bands it is fundamentals that count.' For Mr Chertkow and other economists, the fundamentals are pointing in favour of the franc. 'France clearly leads Germany in the economic cycle,' says Mr Bernard Godement, chief economist at the Nomura Research Institute in Paris. In this respect the rise of the franc is part of a broader reappraisal of the D-Mark, which has seen the German currency weaken against other European currencies. There are other reasons cited for the rise. The prospect of a deal in the Gatt trade talks has eased fears about protectionism. Technical factors are also important. Many currency traders took positions against the franc at FFr3.4180 to the D-Mark, the rate initially defended by the French monetary authorities in the battle against the foreign exchange markets. As the franc again approaches these levels, traders have moved to unwind their positions. Whether the franc maintains its strength is a hazardous prediction. But the prospect of a continued easing in German monetary policy as inflationary pressures weaken, and a revival, if faltering, in the French economy, should support the French currency. The question then, is how the French authorities respond. Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the Bank of France, and his political colleagues are unlikely to rush to reinstate the narrow ERM bands. They are content with the current arrangement, which presents currency speculators with a 'two-way risk' by removing the fixed targets set by the former limits. French officials also suggest that the goal of a single European currency requires only that currencies follow 'normal' bands for two years, under the terms laid down in the Maastricht treaty on European union. An acceleration of interest rate cuts in France, in the near term at least, is similarly regarded as unlikely. 'We should not expect a change in their cautious approach,' says Mr Christopher Potts, economist at Banque Indosuez in Paris, referring to the gradual steps towards lower borrowing costs since the currency crisis. The low-key response by French officials following the franc's return to its narrow bands supports this view. A sustained rally in the franc could, however, provide the scope and even the need for a more independent stance. Mr Godement argues that the French monetary authorities will be confronted by 'a clear trend towards an increase of the external value of the currency', presenting them with the choice between a rising franc or a faster monetary easing than in other countries. Given the desire for stability of the currency, and the fact that GDP growth remains below potential, the decision could be in favour of more rapid cuts in borrowing costs. For French monetary officials such a scenario represents an enticing prospect. But even without further appreciation, most economists believe the intervention rate, the floor for money market rates, can be brought down to about 4.5 per cent next year from 6.2 per cent now. For the moment, Mr Trichet and his colleagues will be more than satisfied to see the franc settle safely back in its former home.</p>

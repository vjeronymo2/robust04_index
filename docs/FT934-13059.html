			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Businessman jailed for 4 years A BUSINESSMAN, whose obsession with antique toys led him to pull off a Pounds 12m fraud, was jailed for four years yesterday at Southwark Crown Court. Mr Jeffrey Levitt pleaded guilty to eight charges of fraudulent trading and evading VAT and import duty between August 1988 and May 1991. His operation, which stretched from Japan to the US, was built on fraud and 'hoodwinking' the banks to give him credit, said Mr David Penry-Davey QC, prosecuting. Mr Stephen Solley QC, defending, told the court: 'Levitt's primary motive was not financial gain. It was to be at the very centre of the toy antique market.'</p>

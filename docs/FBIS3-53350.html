			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Chief Editor Samir Rajab] </F>   [Excerpts] [passage omitted] I asked the president: Let us  move on to political matters. When will the national dialogue  that you called for during the opening of the parliamentary  session of the People's Assembly and Consultative Council start?    The president answered: It is most likely that the dialogue  will start in mid-February. Studies continue now and meetings  are taking place with many figures since the dialogue includes  all national forces.    In his special statements, President Mubarak spoke about his  hopes for his citizens during 1994 and what he wants from them  so that Egypt would always remain cherished, honorable, strong,  and stable.    I asked the president: What would you like to tell the  people with the beginning of the new year?    He answered in an optimistic tone laced with warm  intonations  of love and cordiality: I wish them goodness, the best of  things. Egypt is our country. It is our duty to provide it with  everything that will elevate it and realize progress for it,  especially since its sons are the best, happy to be sheltered  under its wings. Undoubtedly, Egypt will never be ungenerous  with its own sons.    At the same time, I tell our young sons: Do not be misled by  calls of perversion. Do not get involved in any terrorist  operations the objective of which is Egypt's stability and  security, no matter what the material temptations or  psychological pressures are, because, in the end, you will pay  the price yourselves and you will be harmed by your own actions.    The president then added: Those who are trying to exploit  you want to destroy the country. But Egypt will never be  ruined, thanks to God's help and protection and the cohesion of  its sons. I hope all the parties will contribute toward  confronting terrorism which does not differentiate among people.  Everyone, without exception, will suffer from the negative  effects of terrorism.    The president said in his exclusive statements: I hope every  citizen will work to increase production and plan his family,  because a population increase has dangerous repercussions. Our  responsibility is to balance revenues and expenditures. We need  to understand that this cannot be realized so long as population  growth continues at the same rate.    Mr. President, what do you want to tell the Arab brothers  with the beginning of the new year?    President Mubarak answered: I call on the Arab brothers to  close past files. We should all start a new age based on  solidarity and unity, and away from hegemony and control. All  the people of the world cooperate with each other for joint  interests. Therefore, how nice it would be for us Arabs to heed  the experiences of others, especially since our potentials and  resources in various fields are huge and varied. [passage  omitted]    Concluding his exclusive statements, President Mubarak  affirmed that Egypt has exerted and continues to exert huge  efforts to push the peace process forward out of its conviction  that the people of the region should live in friendship and  build their lives on new bases.    We are trying as much as possible to overcome difficulties  with the objective of bringing viewpoints closer so that we can  realize our objectives.    Mr. President, are you optimistic that the Gaza-Jericho  agreement will soon be implemented?    The president answered with optimism and confidence: God  willing, the Gaza-Jericho agreement will soon be implemented.  These are the first steps of a permanent and peaceful solution  and all parties know that very well.</p>

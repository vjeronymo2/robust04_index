			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Chile wins Dollars 267m in farm loans CHILE has secured loans totalling Dollars 267m from the World Bank and Japan, Dollars 165m of which will be used to modernise agriculture and bring more land under irrigation, Leslie Crawford writes from Santiago. Mr Alejandro Foxley, the finance minister, said the credits would help Chile increase its irrigated farmland by 20 per cent in the next four years. The Japanese government's Fund for Economic Co-operation and Development is lending Dollars 172m for irrigation projects, sanitation and the modernisation of the state railway company, Ferrocariles del Estado, which has been earmarked for privatisation. The World Bank loan of Dollars 95m will be used to provide technical assistance and working capital for more than 100,000 small and medium-sized farms. Chilean agriculture is at present sharply divided between a modern, export-oriented fruit and vegetable sector, which earned over Dollars 1bn last year, and a backward and heavily indebted traditional sector which serves the local market. Mr Foxley said the loans would help the traditional sector to diversify crops and increase productivity.</p>

			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Tradepoint seeks exchange status Tradepoint Financial Networks, set up to develop an electronic share-dealing system, has applied to City regulators to become a recognised investment exchange. Being recognised would put it on the same regulatory basis as other exchanges such as the London Stock Exchange and the London Metal Exchange. Mr Peter Bennett, chief executive, said the move would make it more easily recognisable to participants and enable it to deal on a 'peer to peer' basis with other exchanges. The new system is aimed at institutional investors and will be 'order-driven'. It will match volumes and prices of share orders from buyers and sellers, in contrast to the quote-driven system that dominates the stock exchange.</p>

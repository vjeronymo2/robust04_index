			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries fall after Fed decides not to tighten policy US Treasury prices fell yesterday as traders and investors showed their disappointment at the Federal Reserve's decision not to tighten monetary policy. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  27/32 at 83 31/32 , yielding 7.619 per cent. Prices were also lower at the short end of the market, with the two-year note down  1/4 at 98 5/8 , yielding 6.234 per cent. Under normal circumstances, a tightening of Fed policy would trigger a sell-off in the bond market. However, the market plunged late last week after signs of a strengthening labour market had deepened concern that an overheating economy would eventually fuel a revival of inflation. Over the weekend, market participants were looking to the Fed to raise interest rates early this week as a measure to slow the pace of economic growth. Consequently, when the Fed funds rate inched up from 3 3/4 per cent to 4 per cent yesterday morning in anticipation of a policy tightening, the market expected the Fed to signal that it was happy with the new, higher rate. The Fed, however, did just the opposite. During its normal intervention period, the central bank added reserves to the banking system via overnight system repurchase agreements, a manoeuvre designed to push the Fed funds rate back down to 3 3/4 per cent. The Fed's actions were interpreted as a sign that it was not ready to raise interest rates. In spite of the losses, traders said activity on the market was relatively light, but warned that prices would be prone to further weakness so long as the Fed puts off a rate increase. European government bonds opened on a weak note in response to the decline in the US Treasury market on Friday afternoon, and spent most of the day 'Fed-watching' in the expectation of seeing a hike in short-term US interest rates. European bonds ended down from their previous close, and dealers said the focus this week was likely to remain the strong likelihood of a rise in short-term US interest rates and the prospect of further declines in the most keenly-watched German interest rates at the repo today and at the Bundesbank council meeting on Wednesday. In Germany, the Bundesbank issued DM3bn of the Treuhand's new 10-year bond which has a 6 3/4 per cent coupon. The bonds were placed at an issue price of 100.40, yielding 6.69 per cent. Dealers reported switching out of existing 10-year Treuhand and Federal paper in response to the cheap pricing of the new issue, but added that there were no signs of new cash coming into the market. The focus for the bund market today will be the announcement of the Bundesbank's weekly repo result. The market expects to see a further 5-10 basis points shaved off the repo rate - which is currently at 5.41 per cent  -with the prospect of a follow-up cut in the discount rate (now at 5.00 per cent) on Wednesday at the Bundesbank council meeting. The bund futures contract opened at 94.15 and touched a low of 93.96 early in the session, then climbed up to 94.34 and traded at around 94.28 by late afternoon. In France, the central bank left key rates unchanged at yesterday's repo, but dealers said that if the Bundesbank cuts at today's repo this could pave the way for a further cut in French interest rates. UK government bonds opened sharply down in response to Friday's US Treasury bond sell-off, but then clawed back some of their losses leaving long-dated gilts to close about  3/8 of a point lower on the day. Trading volume was relatively thin, however. The release of strong UK consumer credit data for March yesterday showed that the economic recovery remains healthy, dealers said. With a Pounds 516m rise in net consumer credit, they point out that the chances of another cut in the base rate in the immediate future have diminished still further. The main focus for the gilt market on the domestic front is the release today of the Bank of England's Quarterly bulletin and inflation report. This is expected to show that inflationary pressures remain subdued. Japanese government bond prices held up well and closed higher on the day, helped by domestic buying as investors returned from the Golden Week holiday yesterday. While cash bond and futures prices suffered losses initially on the back of Friday's US payroll figures, the market later made up for lost ground. The June futures contract opened at 112.26 and fell to a low of 112.13, then ended at 112.73.</p>

			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / International Company News: Shareholders force Kmart to float units Kmart, the troubled US discount store group, yesterday yielded to pressure from rebellious institutional investors and announced plans to float off three of its four specialty retailing subsidiaries on the stock market. The three companies to be divested are OfficeMax, a chain of office supplies superstores; The Sports Authority, a chain of sporting goods superstores; and Borders/Walden, comprising the Borders book superstores and Waldenbooks book shops. The group's fourth specialty retailing operation, Builders Square, is not considered a candidate for flotation because it does not make a profit. Kmart said the company would stay within the parent group until its future had been decided. Kmart has been forced into the divestment by its shareholders' rejection of an earlier plan to create classes of Kmart shares tied to the performance of the specialty retailers. Kmart had hoped to raise Dollars 600m-Dollars 900m by selling 20 per cent to 30 per cent of these shares without relinquishing control of the subsidiaries. Institutional investors threw out the proposal at the beginning of June because they believed Kmart should sell the specialty retailers outright and devote its energies to revitalising the ailing discount stores, which have been losing customers to Kmart's bigger and more successful rival, Wal-Mart Stores. Under the new plan, Kmart will sell at least 51 per cent of its shares in three of the specialty retailers through initial public offerings, so yielding control of the companies. An initial public offering of shares in OfficeMax will take place in the next few weeks. Kmart said it was confident the revised plan would win shareholders' approval because it had discussed it with institutional investors. The plan would leave the door open to an orderly disposal of Kmart's remaining stakes in the businesses in due course. The new plan marks the second about-turn by Kmart in less than three weeks. Late last month, it said it planned to sell its 21.5 per cent stake in Coles-Myer, the Australian retailer, for ADollars 1.26bn (USDollars 926m), having earlier rejected speculation that a sale was imminent. Meanwhile shareholders still await a promised announcement from Kmart about how it intends to restore profitable growth to its core discount store operations. On Monday it reported that losses on continuing operations had widened by 25 per cent to Dollars 94m in the second quarter to July. Wal-Mart results, Page 19</p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Major set for battle with rebels MR JOHN MAJOR last night set the stage for a bloody confrontation with his party's Euro-sceptics by pledging to push ahead with ratification of the Maastricht treaty. In a determined move to re-establish his political authority without splitting the Conservative party, Mr Major tempered his challenge to Tory rebels by re-emphasising that sterling's re-entry to the European exchange rate mechanism was on indefinite hold. Senior ministers said it would be more than a year - and possibly as long as two - before the pound was put back in the ERM. Mr Major is not ruling out the possibility of tax increases next year if a tighter fiscal policy is needed to underpin the government's anti-inflation strategy. His clear response to charges that the government's European policy was adrift came after a day in which a furious diplomatic row had been sparked by the FT's publication of the Bundesbank's defence of its record during the sterling crisis. The prime minister said he wanted now to 'draw a line' under disputes with Germany. He rejected calls from Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, for the resignation of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, in the wake of the Bundesbank's insistence it had met its obligations to defend sterling in the ERM. Earlier the Foreign Office had summoned the German ambassador to receive a formal protest against the embassy's decision to pass the statement to the FT. But after an 'expression of regret' by the Bundesbank over the incident, Mr Major indicated that his priority was to re-establish good relations with Bonn. That sentiment was echoed by Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, who last night called for calm in Germany's relations with Britain. In visibly combative mood after securing cabinet agreement to reassert the commitment to keep Britain at the 'heart of Europe', Mr Major said he wanted a full-scale Commons debate on Maastricht after the Birmingham summit scheduled for October 14. Despite claims by the Euro-sceptics that he risks civil war on the Tory backbenches, the prime minister indicated that the full force of the party machine would be used to secure a majority for the legislation. He added: 'It is certainly the intention to pass the Maastricht Bill during this session of parliament.' His high-risk decision to defy the Euro-sceptics - for which he demand-ed and received the support of the cabinet - is designed to fill the vacuum in foreign policy left by the ERM debacle. It aims to rebut charges from friends as well as enemies that Mr Major has failed to give a clear lead during the ensuing turmoil. Last night, he left no doubt of his determination to get through the treaty which he declared last December had represented 'game, set and match' for Britain. 'I don't think that, upon reflection, the Commons will think it appropriate for a British prime minister to negotiate a bill, agree a bill and then abandon it - and I don't propose to do so,' he said. That comment came after he had told colleagues that unless Britain ratified Maastricht it would never again be able to secure concessions in negotiations with its European partners. He told the cabinet that nothing less than 'the credibility of Britain' was at stake over the treaty. Mr Major is aware that the move will provoke a series of damaging rows at next week's Conservative party conference, where the Euro-sceptics are promising to mobilise grass-roots opposition to Maastricht. But yesterday Lady Thatcher indicated that she would not use a planned visit to the Brighton conference to launch an attack on her successor in Downing Street. The prime minister is optimistic of a deal with other EC leaders at Birmingham on a declaration committing them to closer definition of the division of authority between Brussels and national governments. After an intense round of diplomatic contacts with his European partners this week, Mr Major believes that a declaration embracing the so-called subsidiarity principle will be one of several clarifications which will make Maastricht more palatable both to Tory MPs and to Denmark, which voted against Maastricht in a referendum, by the time of a second summit in Edinburgh in December. If the Birmingham meeting goes according to plan, Mr Major will hold a debate on the principle of the Maastricht bill soon after the House of Commons returns on October 19. Pressure will be applied to every Tory MP to support it.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed KVB: "Van Mierlo: `Every Day Is a Little </F> More Purple'"]    [Text] The Hague, 10 May (ANP) -- D66 [Democrats 66]  chairman Hans Van Mierlo "is even more optimistic than  yesterday" about the advent of a "purple" [D66, Labor Party, and  People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] coalition. He said  this Tuesday [10 May] following his meeting with Tjeenk Willink,  who is consulting on behalf of the crown on which government  coalition is possible.    Van Mierlo, who let it be known through Tjeenk Willink that  nothing more could be said about the content of the talk, said  that "there was no reason for pessimism. We are moving forward  one step at a time and every day things are getting a little  more purple."    On Tuesday, Tjeenk Willink received the floor leaders of the  three parties which must be part of the "purple coalition." Now  that it looks like these talks will be successful, there is an  expectation that Tjeenk Willink will talk with these three at  the same time. Observers in The Hague do not rule out that  Tjeenk Willink will be able to present the queen with his  conclusions this week, meaning that his information-gathering  efforts lasted shorter than he was expecting on Monday.</p>

			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / International Company News: Wheelock net profits 13% ahead at halfway Wheelock and Company, the Hong Kong holding company for the late Sir YK Pao's listed corporate empire, lifted first-half net profits 13 per cent to HKDollars 1.06bn (USDollars 137m) from last year's corresponding HKDollars 940.3m, year, wites Louise Lucas in Hong Kong. Profits were lifted by an exceptional gain of HKDollars 79.2m on property sales. Earnings per share rose 14 per cent to 52.6 cents from 46.1 cents, and shareholders are to receive an interim dividend of 10.5 cents, up 10.5 per cent from last year's 9.5 cents a share. Mr Peter Woo, group chairman, said the profit rise was solid when viewed against the unfavourable property and retail environments, and the fact the company has been in a building mode. On the retail side, luxury department store group Lane Crawford saw profits slump 47 per cent to HKDollars 52.7m from HKDollars 99.2m over the six-month period. About 66 per cent of the interim profits came from group associate The Wharf (Holdings), Wheelock's 44 per cent-owned associate whose interests include property, infrastructure and hotels.</p>

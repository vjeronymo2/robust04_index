			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Balloon struggles to get airborne: Andrew Hill asks why Europe's single market has failed to take off, a year after its high-profile launch One year after barriers to trade and free movement in the European Union were supposed to come down, many pioneers of the single market are still waiting for Europe to open for business. Mr Don Cameron, who founded one of Britain's few manufacturers of hot-air balloons, has plenty of pioneering spirit, but he is running out of patience. For more than two years, he has been trying to break down the resistance of German technical regulators to the import and sale of his balloons - or rather, the propane gas cylinders used to inflate them. 'It's been a nightmare,' he says. 'I can fly them over Germany, but they can't be transported on the roads.' Mr Knud Buhl of the Danish bacon and meat council faces legal problems in a more down-to-earth area: he claims Germany and France are restricting imports of meat from uncastrated boars. 'We're in a deadlock. What we are doing is fully legal under internal market rules, but illegal according to German law,' says Mr Buhl. The European Commission is challenging the German rules in the European Court of Justice, but in the meantime all Danish slaughterhouses can do is scale down production and wait for a judgment. So what has happened to the single market and its high-sounding pledge to free the movement of people, goods, capital and services across Europe? On paper it is still in good shape. On January 1, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Austria and Iceland joined the market, creating the European Economic Area, the biggest multilateral trading zone in the world. All but the most rabid Euro-sceptics acknowledge that it is, as EU leaders declared after December's Brussels summit, 'a major asset of the European economy'. But since the celebratory fireworks of January 1 1993, the political impetus behind the market seems to have faded. One problem is that the market arrived at the same time as a deep economic recession in continental Europe. As a result, many companies are not strong enough to exploit the potential of the single market, which was first tabled during the more prosperous mid-1980s. Some companies also claim that the single market has imposed additional bureaucratic costs and burdens, exacerbating the economic downturn. According to a survey published this week by KPMG, the UK accountancy firm, 48 per cent of British exporters feel they have not gained from completion of the single market, claiming that increased bureaucracy has cancelled out its benefits. The main criticisms are levelled at the new regime for collecting and monitoring value-added tax on cross-border transactions. Another problem with assessing the market is that many of the important legislative initiatives adopted by the member states have not yet come into force. Vocational qualifications achieved in one member state will not be valid elsewhere in the EU until June. Insurance companies will have to wait until later this year to set up offices and sell policies across frontiers. Stockbrokers will not get their 'single passport' to operate everywhere in Europe until 1996. As for a surge in cross-border shopping, the sight of Britons struggling across the Channel to France to fill their cars with cheaper alcohol represents a failure of the single market - the reluctance of member states to harmonise excise duties - rather than a great success. More seriously, the likes of Mr Buhl and Mr Cameron claim that the new rules of the market are not being properly enforced by the Commission and by member states. This is now the main concern for the Commission, which has been gradually changing its role over the past year, from bulldozing through new legislation to enforcing and co-ordinating existing measures. The change of tone was both necessary and politically prudent. By the end of 1992, the target for completion of the original single market plan, nearly 300 directives and regulations had been proposed by the Commission in six years. At the same time, grassroots resentment against 'meddling Brussels bureaucrats' had reached a climax, with strong opposition to the European Community voiced through referendums on the Maastricht treaty in Denmark and France. Luckily for the Commission, agreement had been reached among member states on almost all of the original programme of legislation. Since January 1 1993, the Commission has fought shy of tabling new legislation; and high-profile European Court cases pursuing sluggish member states have been kept to a minimum. Just before Christmas, Mr Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi, who took over as internal market commissioner a year ago, declared that the Commission had managed to sort out 588 legal complaints against member states 'by friendly agreement following discussion with national administrations'. The question for would-be pioneers of the single market is whether the Commission is now being too soft on member states. Only 115 out of the 219 single market measures that needed to be translated into national legislation by member states have been implemented by everyone. Mr Robert Brooke, European marketing director of Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, says: 'I think in policy terms (the Commission) should set the overall goals and objectives and then let the governments themselves get on with it. But then I think what they have to do is to be much more ruthless with enforcement.' '(The EU) is very weak when it comes to enforcing its measures on member states,' adds Mr Buhl, as he endures the long wait for judgment in the Danish pig-meat case. If the Commission and member states fail to implement the legislative programme evenly across Europe, businesses fear that long-standing distortions to trade will never be ironed out. That could in turn provoke new calls for protectionist measures inside the single market, sapping the commercial strength of the trade zone. In their defence, Brussels officials point out that they are still pursuing nearly 1,000 legal complaints against member states, and Mr Vanni d'Archirafi has promised 'very severe action' to ensure that existing legislation is implemented. In December, the Commission also proposed to member states a detailed 'Strategic Programme', aimed at streamlining the operation of the single market, making it easier for users to take advantage of it, and complain if it goes wrong. But the Commission itself is under fire for its failure to enforce the most basic principle of the 1992 programme: the free movement of people around the Union. Euro Citizen Action Service, a Europe-wide citizens' pressure group, has brought one European Court case against Brussels for not punishing member states that failed to lift passport checks at internal borders, and the European Parliament has brought another. Independently, nine of the 12 EU members have promised to abolish passport controls from February 1. But critics of Brussels' diplomatic approach believe this deadline, like others before it, will be postponed, leaving the Commission short of ammunition with which to attack the others: Britain, Denmark and Ireland. The Commission's own verdict on its grandest project to date, delivered in the 'Strategic Programme', is predictably upbeat: 'The internal market is working.' But the document goes on to admit that 'it can and must be improved in order to fulfil its promise'. Consumer groups, trade associations and small businesses are more cautious. A year on, they say the market is working only for those with the determination and money to fight for their rights, and for those - citizens living near borders, multinational companies and international travellers - already used to dealing with European barriers. The benefits may take longer to trickle down to small companies, occasional tourists, balloon-makers and slaughterhouses.</p>

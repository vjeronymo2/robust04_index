			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / UK Company News: ADT shares rise on Laidlaw peace plan ADT, the Bermuda-based security and car auction group, saw its shares rise yesterday following a peace agreement late on Tuesday with its main shareholder, Laidlaw of Canada, that has led to a shake-up of the board. The shares rose 5p to 89p. Analysts said investors were encouraged that ADT was now more likely to be run as a service group focused on its core businesses. The agreement, which involves Laidlaw dropping allegations of fraud in a New York court, means Mr Michael Ashcroft, ADT chairman and chief executive, and four other ADT insiders will be outnumbered on the board by four independent and four Laidlaw-nominated directors. 'If you believe ADT is now going to be a straight operating company and that asset shuffling and stake building are to end, the market will give the company a higher p/e,' said Mr Mark Shepperd, analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. The market appeared to believe that ADT was less likely to fly off at a tangent with investments like those in Christies International, the auction group, and BAA, the former British Airports Authority. ADT is faced with a Pounds 40m paper loss on its 24 per cent stake in Christies and still holds a 4 per cent stake in BAA after it sold a similar stake last December. The new board might also recommend the sale of some of these non-core investments, though ADT also holds a 27 per cent stake in the Lep Group which has a significant US security business in addition to freight forwarding. Laidlaw insists it has only withdrawn, not dropped, its case against ADT and that investigations into the alleged fraud will continue through an audit committee set up by the new independent directors. The decision to remove the conflict from the public gaze would help protect Laidlaw's 28.4 per cent stake in ADT on which it is currently facing a Dollars 400m paper loss, analysts said.</p>

			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Tec boards suffer exodus TRAINING and enterprise councils suffered a further heavy loss of directors in their second year of operation, according to government figures. Some 201 of the 1,052 directors of Tecs - excluding chairmen - resigned in the 12 months to the end of June. Since the 82 employer-led Tecs were set up more than two years ago to revitalise training and enterprise initiatives in England and Wales about 400 directors have resigned. In the first year of operation 27 per cent of Tec directors resigned. The government yesterday appeared not to view this level of turnover with great concern. The Department of Employment said the reason for directors leaving was rarely controversial. 'As senior Tec personnel are not appointed for fixed periods, this turnover level of busy senior executives represents a perfectly reasonable rate of natural wastage,' it said. Birmingham Tec is typical. One director left because he was made redundant after his company was taken over, two were moved from the city by their employers and one left because he could no longer spare the time from his business. Merseyside Tec has lost three, partly because of their other commitments, the Tec said. None of the directors who have resigned has publicly blamed frustration with the way Tecs are progressing. But some say privately that they have become disillusioned as the government has cut Tecs' budgets. One executive who left a Tec early this year said he started to think about his commitment after his secretary told him that he looked angry every time he came back into the office from a Tec board meeting. He said he had not made his feelings about Tecs public because he had not wanted to 'rock the boat' before the general election.</p>

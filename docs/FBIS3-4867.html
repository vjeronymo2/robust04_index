Megawati, joining in the debate about who should succeed  President Suharto if he steps down in 1998, stressed that the  succession should proceed constitutionally. "I know President  Suharto is a wise man who knows very well that everything should  be in line with the 1945 Constitution," she said as she wound up  her tour of the province on Sunday.    The succession debate resurfaced last week with a statement  from Donald Wilson, an American author who has written about  President Suharto's leadership, that the incumbent leader "knows  when to step down" and that he would not be president for life.    Suharto, now 72 years old, was reelected for his sixth  five-year term in office last year. There is now growing  speculation that he will step down in 1998, if not before  because of his age. The president however has not publicly  disclosed his intentions.    Megawati, who was elected by popular vote in an  unprecedented  party congress in December declined to go into detail when  pressed if she would consider running for the presidency. "I'd  rather keep the answer to myself," she said, but stressed that  the political elite should heed what the people have to say  about the next leader.    She warned that the more the Indonesian people are educated,  the more they will understand their political rights and that  only leaders with broad horizons will be elected.    PDI, the smallest of the three organizations sanctioned by  the government to contest the general election, also urged the  abolishment of the controversial "floating mass" system, which  bars the rural masses from politics except during elections.    Under this policy, political organizations are barred from  setting up branch offices below regency or mayoralty levels.    PDI and the United Development Party (PPP) say the system  benefits their rival, the government-backed Golkar [Functional  Group] because all village heads who can mobilize the masses,  are effectively Golkar cadres.    Both PDI and PPP have been demanding that they be allowed  equal access to reach the grassroots supporters in villages so  that they can compete on equal footing. [passage omitted]</p>

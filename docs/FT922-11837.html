			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Developing-country reformscould bolster performance DEVELOPING countries could be facing a decade of sustainable growth after 10 years of stagnation and falling living standards, the International Monetary Fund believes. 'The developing world would appear to be at a critical juncture,' the IMF says in its latest World Economic Outlook. 'If reforms take hold, and the external environment is favourable, the rest of the decade could see sustainable growth in per-capita gross domestic product; on the other hand, if reforms are not sustained, and if stabilisation policies are relaxed prematurely, growth is likely to remain elusive.' The IMF expects the economies of developing countries, excluding eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, to grow by an average of 6.7 per cent this year. They shrugged off the economic slowdown in industrialised countries and achieved relatively strong average growth of 3.5 and 3.3 per cent in 1990 and 1991 respectively. This resilient performance reflected the adoption of structural reform policies in many countries and the reduction of macro-economic imbalances, such as high fiscal deficits and high inflation. While the prosperity of the industrialised world is still important for the welfare of developing nations, the IMF says it has become increasingly evident in recent years that developing nations' own structural and financial policies are the most decisive determinants of their performance. It says that the successful newly industrialising economies of Asia - Hong Kong, Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand - have pursued generally cautious fiscal and monetary policies and encouraged private-sector activity and export-oriented development. Similar policies are being adopted elsewhere and have resulted in improved economic performance in countries as diverse as Mexico, Chile, Ghana, Mauritius, Morocco and Tunisia. The IMF says the 1980s taught a painful lesson that sustained growth could not be achieved in an environment of high and variable inflation. High inflation hampered investment, in particular. Another IMF finding is that very high military spending in some developing countries has contributed to unsustainable budget deficits and debt servicing difficulties. The Fund says that military spending in the developing world remains excessive at an average of 4.5 per cent of GDP. With lower spending on arms, many countries would be able to increase capital formation and output and improve living standards.</p>

			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / The appeal of foreign climes: A weak domestic market is forcing Japanese banks to increase their overseas lending From the boardrooms of New York to the shopfloors of Kuala Lumpur, a forgotten sound is rippling around the world. It is the murmur of Japanese bankers striking deals with foreign clients. Four years ago, the Japanese global lending explosion disintegrated amid recession, bad debts and regulatory restraint. But Tokyo's banks are now returning to the world's markets - awakening the fears of European and American bankers, who remember the bruising experience of being undercut by the Japanese on lending rates. 'After several years of declining lending overseas, we are at last starting to see signs of a sustained increase in most markets,' said Sanwa Bank's Mr Masateru Nakamura, deputy general manager of the international division. In Asia, foreign lending by the main Japanese commercial banks has jumped by 12 per cent, or Y1,000bn, in the past year, with all the banks opening new offices in Thailand, China, Malaysia and even Vietnam. In the past six months, the banks have seen the first increase for four years in lending volumes in America. Only European markets remain subdued, but even there most banks expect an increase in the next year. However, the motivation for this lending recovery is different from a decade ago. In the 1980s, Japanese banks, bloated by the country's huge current account and savings surpluses, became the world's leading lenders. Now, feeling the pinch at home, these same banks have been forced to look offshore for business to maintain growth in their balance sheets. Domestic lending by Japan's 11 leading city banks has fallen by Y3,000bn, or more than 1 per cent, in the last year, the first drop in decades, as corporations continue to adjust to the over-accumulation of capital in the 1980s, and banks remain wary of repeating the mistakes that led to their bad debt problems. In the longer term, the domestic outlook is even worse, with companies turning away from bank lending to bond issuance as a source of finance. 'The domestic market is so weak, we made a decision earlier this year to step up foreign lending to fill the gap,' said Mr Tomoyuki Shoji, of Sakura's International Planning Division. 'This is not a temporary shift,' adds Mr Kazuaki Kitabatake at Fuji Bank's international division. 'We are seeing a long-term structural change in our operations towards more foreign lending.' This view is causing alarm among foreign bankers. The last surge in Japanese lending overseas brought claims of unfair competition. European and US bankers argued Japanese banks could offer cheap loans because of the low cost of funds in Japan, held down by a system of regulated deposit interest rates. Even more troubling was the apparently easy availability of capital which enabled banks to expand their lending. Under Japanese rules, unrealised gains on equity holdings could be counted as capital, a benefit that mushroomed in significance as the Japanese stock market took off in the late 1980s. In 1988 the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) attempted to rein in the Japanese by imposing stricter rules on the treatment of equities as capital. Recession at home and a mountain of bad debts around the world also forced Japan's banks to cut their lending overseas, which peaked in 1991. New lending has been stagnant until this year. Eager to defuse concerns over their return to the international market, the banks say there are important differences today. The new capital adequacy rules require them to have much higher capital ratios than before - so increases in lending will require larger increases in capital than previously. This month, the final remaining regulations capping interest rates were removed by the Ministry of Finance, limiting the availability of cheap funds. And the bad debt crisis of the past four years has radically altered the creditworthiness of Japanese banks - increasing the cost of raising funds. But the pressure on banks to expand their overseas business in the absence of lending growth at home will put pressure on them to keep margins thin. More important, the apparent disappearance of some of the favourable conditions for Japanese banks is largely illusory. Capital adequacy ratio requirements may be tougher, but the ease with which banks managed to replenish their capital in the early 1990s, despite falling stock markets, mean that ratios are now well above minimum BIS levels, even if they are below those of US and European banks. The average ratio of capital - including share capital, convertible debt and discounted equity holdings - to assets, for the six largest Japanese banks is more than 9.5 per cent - comfortably above the minimum 8 per cent BIS guidelines and leaving plenty of room for expansion. Those ratios have also been helped by the strong yen, which has cut the value of overseas loans, while leaving the value of capital (in yen) unchanged. Though interest rates have been deregulated, relatively relaxed monetary conditions mean they remain much lower than in other countries. The average deposit rate in Japan is about 3 per cent, against 5-6 per cent in Europe and the US. Japanese banks hold a higher share of their liabilities in the form of short-term demand deposits - which carry low interest rates - than their US and European counterparts. Furthermore, Japanese banks have traditionally accepted a smaller return on assets than US and European banks. Average net interest as a proportion of total income at the leading Japanese banks is just over 1 per cent, against 2.5 per cent in the UK and 2.9 per cent in the US. According to Mr David Marshall at the bank credit rating agency, IBCA, this is largely due to the way the banks were set up by government fiat after the second world war. They were meant to channel funding at the cheapest rate from savers to industry, to finance Japan's industrial reconstruction. Shareholders' interests were not paramount, and the spreads the banks were prepared to take were much lower. For these reasons, the scope for cheap lending remains. According to Ms Alicia Ogawa, analyst at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo: 'Japanese banks continue to have a significant competitive advantage over their foreign rivals. It's just that nobody has noticed it for the past few years because they've been cutting back.' Now they are returning, the Japanese banks are pressing their advantage by paring lending rates. US and European bankers argue that loans to 'investment grade' companies must have margins of at least 0.8 per cent over their cost of funds to cover costs and make a return on capital. But Sanwa officials say that they are prepared to see margins as low as 0.5-0.75 per cent. According to Sakura's Mr Shoji, the bank will go 'no lower' than 0.25 per cent. Most other Japanese banks are within this range. The Japanese respond to criticism that these margins are suicidally unprofitable by saying they are simply responding to competitive pressures in a market where demand for capital is still relatively weak. The Industrial Bank of Japan's senior international manager Mr Yasuharu Yoneda, says: 'Other banks are cutting their margins, so we have to be prepared to go lower.' If, as seems probable, the Japanese banks start to recover their market share in overseas lending, US and European banks may yet persuade the regulators to take a closer look at one aspect of their business - their treatment of bad debts. Under Japanese rules, banks have to declare as non-performing only those loans to bankrupt companies or those on which no interest has been paid for six months or more. Typically, US and European bank regulators have stricter criteria, usually requiring banks to declare loans on which interest has been cut sharply. Since non-performing loans are offset against capital, this enables the Japanese to increase their lending much more sharply than other banks. Mr Marshall estimates that under US rules, the capital adequacy ratios of many Japanese banks would be below BIS minima, prompting an even more serious retrenchment than four years ago. Seven years ago, there was pressure on the Japanese to adjust to the rules of that market-place. In the end, they were forced by other factors to pull in their horns. As they return to the fray, they can expect more hostility from their international competitors this time.</p>

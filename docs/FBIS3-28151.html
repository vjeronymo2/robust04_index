Among the main points  are: 1) To study a reduction of land value tax on land for  public use; 2) to postpone a plan to ease conditions for a  special tax break for selling one's residential property to buy  a more expensive one; and 3) to postpone implementation of an  increase in liquor and tobacco taxes. Moreover, the package  includes plans to maintain special corporate tax and to change  delayed payment of inheritance tax into payment in kind. The  ruling parties are scheduled to reach a conclusion on income tax  reduction and revenue sources for the reduction, at their  representative meeting. Subsequently, in combining the  currently-revealed package with the conclusion on income tax  cuts, they intend to compile the ruling parties' outline for  revision of the tax system for fiscal year 1994 on 8 February.    The centerpiece of the proposal package is the land tax  system. The ruling parties have advocated the need to study a  reduction of land value tax on land which "is used for public  purposes." Moreover, in view of demands among the ruling parties  for the abolition of land value tax, the package indicates: "The  role of land tax value should be replaced with that of property  taxes from a medium-to-long term point of view." At the same  time, regarding alteration or abolition of land value tax, it  stipulates the principle of "continuing the system itself for  the time being."    Regarding the issue of increasing taxes on profits from  transfer of corporations, the ruling parties have demanded that  the present limit for a holding period be abolished and the tax  rate be set at 10 percent in all cases. On this issue, the  Ministry of Finance has already worked out its proposal: "The  basic points of the tax such as the tax rate remain untouched  and the scope of tax reduction for the sellers be expanded."  However, the ruling parties' proposal package mentions "the  current situation in which even if companies try to tackle  restructuring in a bid to overcome the economic recession, they  have to give up the plan due to the lack of financial  resources." Thus, the package reflects demands made by  Shinseito, Komeito, and other parties on the issue.    Regarding a special tax break for selling one's residential  property to buy a more expensive one, the idea of easing  conditions concerning transfer prices has now cropped up within  the ruling coalition. However, the package points out: "The tax  break system was already revised in 1993," and demands the  current limit of "100 million yen" be maintained. Meanwhile,  regarding a tax break for selling business property, the package  proposes the introduction of special measures for selling  depreciation assets from the viewpoint of promoting the  restructuring of companies.    As for indirect taxes, the package clearly indicates a  critical view of the growing demand within the government for  increased liquor and tobacco taxes, saying: "It is difficult to  seek public understanding of such an increase which may be  regarded as an increase in the general public's tax burden."  Regarding the issue of how taxes ought to be put on  public-service corporations -- the issue is now being discussed  as an example of the preferential taxation treatment -- the  package stresses: "It is necessary to see that there are many  cases where the preferential system of taxation is used badly  and such cases should not be overlooked." Stating that "some  measures should be taken to remedy the situation," the package  proposes such measures as lowering limits of taxation on  profit-making business to improve the taxation system.</p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Nottingham Co-op seeks CWS merger The Greater Nottingham Co-operative Society, one of the largest co-operative societies still trading independently, has approached the Co-operative Wholesale Society about a possible merger, writes John Thornhill. Its incorporation into the CWS would confirm the trend of recent years which has shown a marked consolidation of the co-operative movement. The GNCS, which employs about 7,000 people, last year turned over Pounds 381.4m and made operating profits of Pounds 9.4m. It runs 113 grocery stores and 70 non-food stores and also offers funeral, garage and travel services.</p>

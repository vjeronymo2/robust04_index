			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Liberal Party presidential candidate Ernesto </F> Samper at his campaign headquarters at the Orquidea Real Hotel  in Santa Fe de Bogota on 29 May -- recorded]    [Text] This is a message of optimism. I am very grateful  to all the people who accompanied me today. Of course, we would  have liked this election to be decided today, but that was not  possible. I won the first round. [applause]    I hope I will be able to continue relying on you and on your  happiness, support, and enthusiasm because we are going to win  the runoff elections. Thanks to the people of Bogota, my dear  city, for their exemplary behavior [applause, cheers] and to all  the people throughout the country who supported me. Thank you  very much.    I have come here with vice presidential running mate Dr.  Humberto De la Calle, not only to celebrate the events of the  day, as we are doing tonight with you, but also to celebrate the  two to one victory we just had over the Milan soccer team.  [applause] Thanks for your company and now, let the party  continue.</p>

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Iveco Ford optimistic over recovery IVECO FORD TRUCK, the UK's second-biggest truck maker, has joined market leader Leyland DAF in forecasting a recovery in the depressed UK truck market later this year. Mr Alan Fox, managing director of the company, which is majority-owned by Fiat of Italy's Iveco commercial vehicles division, suggested that sales would rise by about 15 per cent to 37,000 units from last year's 32,184. Statistics from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show the present sales plunge to have been the sharpest since the Second World War. The Iveco Ford forecast is slightly more pessimistic than that of Leyland DAF, whose marketing and sales director, Mr David Gill, has suggested a level of 38,000 to 42,000, depending largely on the outcome and timing of the general election. Backing for the recovery view was provided by SMMT statistics for December, which showed a drop of only 12.37 per cent in sales of all commercial vehicles, to 11,288, compared with the previous year's level. Black Horse Financial Services, a Lloyds Abbey Life subsidiary that markets financial services to Lloyds Bank customers, yesterday ordered 2,000 Rover 218SLD Turbo cars for its regional staff. The order, worth Pounds 26.5m, is a boost for the diesel sector, one of the few fast-growing sectors of the UK market for new cars.</p>

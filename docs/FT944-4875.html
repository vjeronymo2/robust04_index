			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Survey of Swiss Banking (6): Draught through a cosy world - Insurance / A deregulated market faces competition from abroad Times are changing in the once-staid and tightly-controlled Swiss insurance market in the wake of increasing deregulation and intensified competition in Europe. Switzerland's biggest insurers have recently taken aggressive steps to solidify their presence at home and in world markets. Meanwhile, foreign companies have begun to muscle in on the SFr30bn-a-year domestic insurance scene - not easy in a market which, after years of cosy informal cartellisation between Swiss companies, is one of the most concentrated in Europe. In parallel with the elimination last July of barriers to insurance business within the European Union, tariffs in most life and non-life sectors in Switzerland have now been freed. Fixed tariffs for compulsory third party motor insurance will be scrapped from January 1996. Though the Swiss market remains profitable - the Swiss are the world's biggest spenders on insurance, laying out a staggering Dollars 3,000 a year each on premiums - it no longer provides the secure financial padding of old. Swiss insurers, like their European counterparts, are looking both to cut costs and to focus more selectively on profitable market opportunities rather than premium volume growth for its own sake. That, in turn, means producing new and better products and selling them effectively. Those best suited to prosper in the new environment, analysts believe, will be the big diversified insurance companies with efficient distribution networks and low costs, along with specialist niche players. For medium-sized companies with undifferentiated products, the prospects look dim. This was the reasoning behind the surprise announcement last September by Swiss Re, the world's second-ranking reinsurer, to sell off its direct insurance operations to Allianz, the German insurance giant, and Winterthur, the biggest insurer in the Swiss market. The deal, worth more than SFr5.3bn, will 'almost halve' the 48 per cent of Swiss Re's total premium income from primary insurance operations. The company is now free to concentrate on its more volatile but highly profitable core reinsurance business. Zurich Insurance and Winterthur, Switzerland's largest primary insurers, are seen as well-placed to take advantage of deregulation at home and abroad. Zurich already does three-quarters of its business overseas (a quarter in the US) and Winterthur over half, mostly in Europe. That has not stopped them slugging it out in Switzerland's newly-liberalised SFr4bn-a-year motor insurance market. That business is about to be transformed, after years in which standard policies - often for five- or 10-year terms - were sold to customers by a network of local agents. Last spring Winterthur, the market leader, unveiled a new 'modular' car insurance policy, the 'Strada', allowing customers to choose their cover a la carte. This was quickly trumped by Zurich Insurance which in July launched Zuritel, Switzerland's first cut-priced motor insurance telephone sales operation. Zurich sees Zuritel as a forerunner for direct selling operations elsewhere in Europe and in other branches of insurance. Some 20-50 per cent of insurance contracts in Europe may be sold in future by telephone or interactive television, the company believes. Zurich is already having considerable success with direct sales by its newly-acquired British subsidiary, Zurich Municipal, which specialises in local authority insurance. Winterthur was an even earlier pioneer in direct telephone sales through Churchill, now Britain's second largest motor insurer. Smaller Swiss companies have also shown themselves game for a fight. La Baloise, Switzerland's fourth largest insurer, announced a deal this summer with the Swiss Touring Club to offer cheap motor insurance to its 1.3m members - half of Switzerland's motorists. Elsewhere, a significant move was Zurich's acquisition in September of a bank, Zurich-based Rud, Blass, which specialises in securities trading, broker business and investment consulting. The company plans to use the bank to expand its asset management services, now that liberalisation of life insurance regulations allows insurers to offer investment trust-linked life insurance policies. Winterthur, meanwhile, has been buttressing its European operations. In January it succeeded at its third attempt to secure a significant slice of the huge and fast-growing German market. A complex deal with Commerzbank gave it control of DBV (Deutsche Beamten-Versicherungskasse), making Winterthur Germany's 10th biggest primary insurer. Then in September Winterthur strengthened its position in southern Europe, agreeing to buy for SFr355m Swiss Re's direct insurance operations in Italy and Spain plus its stake (via its Elvia subsidiary) in the Spanish group La Equitativa. Though Swiss insurance companies employ nearly twice as many people abroad as at home - 87,935 against 48,319 in Switzerland at the end of last year - the domestic market has been a Swiss preserve. Foreign companies had a meagre 2 per cent of premium business in 1992. Next year that proportion could be over 10 per cent. The biggest foreign invader has been Germany's Allianz, Europe's largest insurer. At the start of the year, Allianz owned two small Swiss insurance companies with a combined premium income in 1993 of just SFr270m. But in June Allianz bought a stake of over 30 per cent in the Berner insurance group, a medium-sized company with 1993 premium income of just over SFr1bn and a 5 per cent share of the Swiss non-life market. And in September it snapped up an even juicier morsel - Swiss Re's Elvia, Switzerland's fifth biggest direct insurer with 9 per cent of the domestic market and premium income of SFr2.6bn last year. Allianz is also buying from Swiss Re the Vereinte Group (ranked fifth in Germany with nearly SFr5.9bn in annual premium income) and an Italian company, Lloyd Adriatico. Elvia and Lloyd Adriatico will be acquired through Allianz's Italian subsidiary, Riunione Adriatica di Sicurta (RAS). Earlier, Assicurazioni Generali of Italy gained a controlling stake in Fortuna, a small Swiss company mainly active in life insurance, and Alte Leipziger of Germany took a 10 per cent stake in Helvetia as part of a co-operation deal. On the domestic front, too, Switzerland's medium-sized companies are increasingly turning to partnerships to help them compete effectively. Helvetia and Patria have strengthened their co-operation over the past year, as have Swiss Life and La Mobiliere, both mutual companies and respective Swiss market leaders in life and non-life insurance.</p>

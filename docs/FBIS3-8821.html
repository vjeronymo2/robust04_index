			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Sarajevo, March 16 (AFP) -- The Moslem-led  Bosnian Government and Bosnian Serbs were to initial an  agreement at Sarajevo airport on Wednesday [16 March] for the  opening of roads around the Bosnian capital. Three corridors  have been chosen which, once open, will have the effect of  partially lifting the Serb siege of Sarajevo. One will pass  through the Serb-held industrial suburb of Vogosca to reach  central Bosnia via the Moslem town of Visoko, 25 kilometres (15  miles) from here. The other two routes will link the Serb  suburbs of Ilizda and Lukavica and the Bosnian suburbs of Butmir  and Dobrinja, passing through the airport which is in the hands  of the UN Protection Force. Once initialled, the agreement is  due to take effect from Saturday, for civilian and commercial  traffic. UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] will have to be given  24-hour notice of transport of merchandise, which it will  communicate to the two sides, and the entry and exit points will  be under UN guard.    In other areas, Bosnian Serb troops continued to defy a  United Nations Security Council demand Monday to lift their  nine-month siege of the northern Moslem enclave of Maglaj to  allow access for humanitarian convoys. Aid has been unable to  reach Maglaj by road since October. The besieged communities  have since then been forced to rely on air drops. [passage  omitted]</p>

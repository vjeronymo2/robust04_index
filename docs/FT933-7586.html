			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Paris unveils five-year jobs plan: Taxes on employers to be cut - More flexible labour market sought FRANCE yesterday launched a five-year plan to create jobs by reducing taxes on employers and increasing the flexibility of the labour market, but leaving the social security system intact. Rising unemployment, which stands at 11.6 per cent of the workforce and is forecast to reach 12.5 per cent by the end of the year, is one of the biggest problems facing Mr Edouard Balladur's centre-right RPR-UDF coalition government. Reducing unemployment is seen as central to the hopes of the conservative parties in the 1995 presidential election. Mr Michel Giraud, the labour minister who unveiled the 55-point plan, said it was aimed at addressing the structural problems of the labour market. He said it would cut the costs of hiring workers, encourage part-time employment and ease rigidities in working practices. The principal measures include the transfer from employers to the government of social security charges for France's lowest paid workers. The transfer is expected to include employees earning up to 1.5 times the minimum wage of about FFr5,900 (Pounds 660) a month. The plan also proposes the replacement of the 39-hour working week with an equivalent annual total to improve the flexibility of production within industry and cut overtime payments. Under the proposals, part-time workers will be able to increase the number of hours they work while receiving state benefits. The system of apprenticeships and training will be devolved to local government organisation. But the measures stopped short of reforming the minimum wage, or salaire minimum de croissance (Smic), regarded by industrialists as one of the most important obstacles to employment. Mr Balladur said last week he would not use 'the pretext of economic crisis to reduce the protection of the least advantaged'. The measures were also limited by budgetary considerations. Labour market analysts estimated that transferring social security payments to the state would cost about FFr4.8bn this year and more than FFr100bn for the five-year period. The government has forecast a budget deficit for the current year of FFr317bn. But private sector economists, such as Mr Jean-Francois Mercier at Salomon Brothers, predict the deficit will be closer to FFr350bn. Economists in Paris said the plan was unlikely to have a rapid impact on unemployment. 'They are right to address structural issues,' said one economist, 'but the Smic is untouched and the economic situation is likely to push unemployment higher.' The stagnant state of the French economy was illustrated yesterday by industrial production figures which showed output in June had declined by 0.2 per cent from May and that second quarter production was 0.3 per cent below the first quarter. Union leaders, who will discuss the plan with Mr Balladur next month, expressed their opposition. Mr Marc Blondel, general secretary of Force Ouvriere, described it as 'dangerous'. But the government's large parliamentary majority suggests that significant changes are unlikely. French prepare financial reshuffle, Page 2 See Lex</p>

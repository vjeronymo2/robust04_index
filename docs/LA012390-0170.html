			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> MUSICIANS QUIT OVER CONTRACT  </P> <P> Sixteen of the 24 tenured musicians of the Minneapolis Chamber Symphony have  quit after abstaining from voting on a contract proposal.  </P> <P> The musicians issued a statement Monday saying the orchestra's board had  threatened to disband the orchestra if the musicians didn't ratify the  contract.  </P> <P> They said the board also threatened to sue the union if the musicians pursued  in further negotiations their wish for significant input in artistic decisions.  </P> <P> Brad Eggen, union president, said the 18-month contract was ratified by a  majority of the eight remaining tenured musicians who voted on it Sunday. "We  were committed to accepting the best possible offer from the management," he  said.  </P> <P> Orchestra Manager John Coughlin said he has no plans to cancel any concerts.  "We've got a Rolodex full of people who want to audition for this orchestra,"  he said. "We anticipate we'll have musicians of as good -- or better --  caliber."  </P></p>

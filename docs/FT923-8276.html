			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / UK Company News: A market dogged by overcapacity - Christopher Price on the perennial problems faced by the travel industry YESTERDAY'S falls in the share prices of Owners Abroad and Airtours has once again focused worries over the impact of price discounting on the holiday groups' revenues as the summer season enters its final leg. Dismissing the speculation, Mr Geoffrey Stone, finance director of Owners Abroad, said that 'discounting in the high season is never heavy' and that reports of overcapacity had been overdone. But in spite of such denials, rumours of large-scale discounting have refused to go away, undermining the performance of the shares in recent months and fuelling stories of a return to the price-war days of the mid-1980s. The problem for tour operators and industry analysts alike is that they must make their forecasts some 18 months prior to a particular season. Consequently, demand and supply figures for the 1992 summer season will have been calculated in April last year. Forecasting the right number of holidays to offer will result in less price discounting and higher revenues. While everyone agrees that this year's holiday market has grown, there seems little doubt that the tour operators' forecasts from last year were optimistic, not surprising given the accepted wisdom of a consumer-led recovery. But most analysts reckon that while many in the industry were forecasting up to 30 per cent passenger growth this year, the actual figure has been about 5 per cent. This in a market where Owners admits to increasing its holidays by 16 per cent, Airtours by 30 per cent and Thomson by an estimated 6 per cent. Between them, these three supply 75 per cent of the package tour market. The result has been a flurry of weighty discounting, particularly in May and June, although a marked improvement has been reported in the the past four weeks. One problem for analysts is the difficulty in obtaining hard information on the state of the market - some have been forced to visit travel agents to gauge levels of demand and discounting. Their fears were partly confirmed last week when Lunn Poly, the travel agency chain, said that oversupply would mean bargain holidays for late bookers. Thomson, the market leader, has been the most vociferous in declaring its intent to defend its market share, even at the risk of sparking another price war. It fired the opening salvo in January, slashing Pounds 15m from 300,000 holidays. Its rivals have been forced to retaliate in order to fill their excess capacity. While some degree of discounting is catered for in company budgets and market forecasts, it is this vicious circle of overcapacity and sliding prices that the City fears. Analysts have responded by revising forecasts and the shares have traded on low price-earnings ratios compared with the market. Owners Abroad, whose shares crumbled from 121p on March 2 to stand at just 66p yesterday, is currently at a discount to the market of about 50 per cent. Airtours' discount is about 36 per cent, reflecting its lower operational costs and higher profits growth. Even so, its shares have tumbled from 334p at the end of April, to 215p yesterday. 'The City is unlikely to ever give holiday companies a premium rating because of their ability to increase capacity so quickly and the low barriers to entry to the industry,' says Mr Hamish Dickson at broker Hoare Govett. 'It all makes for a very volatile profit line.' It also undermines the credibility of an industry trying to build confidence after the collapse last year of International Leisure Group, the UK's second biggest tour operator. But a succession of smaller highly-publicised insolvencies - such as Monday's appointment of receivers at Manchester Flight Centre - and a swirl of summer rumours that a medium-sized operator may follow suit, have not helped the industry's image, although it has to be said that those companies at risk are usually either niche players or operating outside of the mainstream of the industry. The large established companies, such as Airtours and Owners Abroad, are cash-strong and able to withstand most of what the volatile industry brings their way. Mr Peter Hilliar, at BZW, says: 'It has always been a very cyclical industry with profit dependent on its peak periods. When discounting is low and booking high the share prices are still kept at a 15-20 per cent discount. Now their ratings have slipped back on all the old fears. The market needs to be convinced that the profits are going to be delivered.'</p>

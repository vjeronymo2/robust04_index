			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BLIND WOMAN HIT WHILE TRYING TO CROSS INTERSECTION  </P> <P> A 33-year-old woman was critically injured Monday as she attempted to cross  Crown Valley Parkway not far from where a 3-year-old was struck and killed less  than two weeks ago, reigniting concern about traffic along the heavily traveled  route.  </P> <P> Darcel Briones of Laguna Niguel sustained head and pelvic injuries and two  broken legs in the early morning accident. Briones, who is legally blind, was  listed in critical condition after she underwent brain surgery at Mission  Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo, authorities said.  </P> <P> The accident occurred about 8:30 a.m. as Briones, carrying a white cane,  attempted to cross the intersection where Alicia Parkway dead-ends into Crown  Valley. Friends and witnesses said that Briones, who lives about a half-mile  away, was walking to the nearby shopping center when she was hit.  </P> <P> Police said Briones, whose vision is restricted to a few feet, walked across  the westbound lanes and stopped in the median. As she attempted to cross the  westbound lanes against a green light in a marked crosswalk, motorists pleaded  with her to stop, said Laguna Niguel Mayor Patricia C. Bates, who received a  police briefing on the accident.  </P> <P> Police said Briones was struck in the intersection by a car driven by John  MarcLagourgue, 21, of Laguna Beach. Lagourgue was not cited and an  investigation is under way.  </P> <P> State law gives the right of way to blind people carrying white canes,  Sheriff's Lt. Richard J. Olson said. Investigators will attempt to determine  whether the driver was in a position to see the cane, Olson said.  </P> <P> The accident was similar to a tragedy on Sept. 27 when a 3-year-old boy was  killed after he and his baby-sitter were struck by a passing car as they walked  against a green light at the intersection of Nueva Vista and Crown Valley about  a mile up the road.  </P> <P> The death of 3-year-old Thomas Burge reignited community concern about speeding  motorists on Crown Valley, one of south county's most heavily traveled  roadways. Some residents have dubbed the roadway "the Crown Valley Freeway" and  have called on city and county officials to reduce the 50 m.p.h. limit along  sections of the six-lane parkway.  </P> <P> "The young man (driver) probably was not speeding, but each and every accident  along Crown Valley should be a lesson for the powers that be . . . because  something has to be done (about the speed limit) sooner than later," said  Michael Roos, a Laguna Niguel resident who was shopping at a grocery store in  the Alpha Beta shopping center after Monday's accident.  </P> <P> Albert Vanderschams, Briones' next-door neighbor, speculated that traffic  lights contributed to Monday's accident.  </P> <P> "I've walked there many times, and you cannot cross the median without the  'Don't Walk' lights coming on," said Vanderschams, 64. "Think how much more  difficult it would be for someone who can't see well, or is legally blind for  that matter."  </P> <P> Bates, who launched her political career 10 years ago as a founder of a  community group dedicated to reducing the parkway's speed limits, on Monday  called the accident "an unfortunate tragedy."  </P> <P> Bates said the Sheriff's Department, which contracts to provide police services  for the city of Laguna Niguel, had increased patrols on the thoroughfare.  </P> <P> "We are satisfied that they have increased their numbers," Bates said.  "Speeders are more mindful of their presence."  </P> <P> Residents of Pointe Niguel Apartments, the complex where Briones lives,  expressed shock.  </P> <P> "She's a very independent person," said neighbor Jennifer Baker. "She takes a  lot of pride in doing things for herself . . . like going to the store and  entertaining her friends. It's so sad."  </P> <P> Vanderschams said Briones lived alone but received support from her parents who  live in San Juan Capistrano.  </P> <P> "She takes good care of herself," Vanderschams said. "Why did this have to  happen?"  </P></p>

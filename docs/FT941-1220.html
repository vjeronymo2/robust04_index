			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / International Company News: Partial float for Dutch group Ballast Nedam, the Dutch construction group which was formerly owned by British Aerospace, is to be partially floated on the Amsterdam stock exchange in an offering scheduled to take place before the end of April. A minimum of 2m cumulative preference shares are to be offered for sale by ING Group of the Netherlands, which bought Ballast Nedam for Fl 500m (Dollars 263m) in December as part of a consortium that also included Hochtief, the German construction group, and the Ballast Nedam pension fund. The price of the shares will be announced later. The consortium had said earlier that a flotation in the spring was expected, but had given no details. Ballast Nedam has a share capital of 10m shares, divided between 5.3m ordinary and 4.7m cumulative preference shares. The company plans to apply for a listing for all of its preference shares, of which at least 2m will be offered by sale out of ING Group's stake of 49.99 per cent. ING's banking subsidiary ING Bank will lead manage the issue. Hochtief's stake will be unchanged at 48 per cent, as will the pension fund's 2.1 per cent holding. Ballast Nedam was listed on the Amsterdam bourse before its takeover by BAe in 1987.</p>

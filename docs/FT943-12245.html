			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Marling in black as profits increase abroad Marling Industries reported yesterday a return to the black thanks to increased profits from its overseas operations and sharply reduced disposal costs. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 743,000 in the year to March 31 against losses of Pounds 9.6m a year earlier. Exceptional costs were Pounds 1.4m compared with Pounds 8.7m from losses on disposal of discontinued operations. Pressure on prices pushed turnover on continuing operations down from Pounds 54.7m to Pounds 48.6m. Total turnover was down 25 per cent from Pounds 79m to Pounds 59m, including Pounds 6.5m from acquisitions and Pounds 3.96m (Pounds 24.3m) from discontinued operations. Overseas operations contributed 75 per cent of sales. Marling's strongest performance came from its automotive seat belt webbing divisions in the Netherlands and Australia. Exports from Webco, its Australian offshoot, continued to grow, particularly to India, Japan, New Zealand and China. Mr David Smith, chief executive, said these markets offered longer term joint venture possibilities. Mr Smith said high organic growth was anticipated.</p>

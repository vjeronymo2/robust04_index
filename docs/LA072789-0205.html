			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MAYOR ACCUSED OF PUTTING ATLANTIC CITY 'UP FOR SALE'  </P> <P> Mayor James Usry, a former Harlem Globetrotter who ousted a corrupt incumbent  in a recall fight and rose to the presidency of the National Conference of  Black Mayors, was arrested today and charged with taking a $6,000 bribe and  putting local government "up for sale."  </P> <P> Usry, the only black Republican mayor of a major New Jersey municipality, was  one of 14 Atlantic City politicians, public officials, and businessmen charged  after a nine-month undercover investigation of corruption in the oceanside  casino resort.  </P> <P> The defendants, facing various charges of bribery, conspiracy, official  misconduct and election law violations, also included the City Council  president, two other council members, a former council member, a county  freeholder, a freeholder candidate and seven others.  </P> <P> The charges described five separate but overlapping bribery and  influence-peddling conspiracies that, as a whole, indicate that "the regulation  of economic activity in Atlantic City, as administered by those arrested, has  been up for sale," State Police Supt. Clinton Pagano said.  </P> <P> He was accused of taking a $6,000 payoff Friday from a local businessman  working undercover for the State Police. The bribe was allegedly paid in a  hospital room where Usry, 67, was recovering from a shoulder injury incurred in  a gardening accident. It allegedly was in return for Usry's backing a proposed  ordinance allowing operation of motorized versions of the resort's famous  Boardwalk "rolling chairs" during the summer months.  </P> <P> Usry was a center from 1946 to 1951 with the New York Renaissance, an all-black  team that became part of the world famous Harlem Globetrotters during his  tenure. He became Atlantic City's assistant superintendent of schools in 1977.  </P></p>

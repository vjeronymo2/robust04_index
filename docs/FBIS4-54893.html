			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The State Chamber today finally begun discussing  the budget documents for this year. As is known, the state  treasury involves 406 billion tolars, and the budget deficit may  reach somewhat less than 12 billion tolars. Before the deputies  commenced the debate on the proposed amendments to the Law on  Implementing the Budget and to the numerous individual items of  the budget -- there are more than 170 of those -- deputies heard  introductory speeches by Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek, Finance  Minister Mitja Gaspari, Dr. France Arhar, governor of the Bank  of Slovenia, and representatives of the Pension Institute and  Health Institute. Here is a report by Suzana Kos:    [Begin recording] [Kos] After six years of recession, last  year our state embarked upon economic growth for the first time.  In the first quarter, industrial production was as much as 3.4  percent higher than in the same period last year. This is what  Prime Minister Drnovsek pointed out in his introductory speech.  Improvement is seen in building, traffic, tourism, and  agriculture. The number of unemployed reduced by more than 6  percent until March, while the number of employed has increased.  Last year's inflation was the lowest since 1979 and, according  to Dr. Drnovsek, it is not going to increase in the future  either. After lengthy negotiations, the agreement on the policy  of wages in this year and the section on wages of the collective  agreements were signed last year, and all partners have agreed  to a fixed increase of nominal wages below the rate of  inflation. Prime Minister Drnovsek spoke about the outcome of  the negotiations, the signed document, and for the first time  announced the corresponding legal document.    [Drnovsek] With this agreement, the government also received  the approval of other negotiating partners, the trade unions,  and representatives of employers to establish by law the  realization of such an agreement keeping in mind the poor  experience with realizing collective agreements last year. In  our opinion, a significant (?breakthrough) will be reached in  managing this perhaps most necessary sphere of macroeconomic  policy. Realistic possibilities have been established for [word  indistinct] most unfavorable currents by the end of 1994 and for  the establishment of such macroeconomic conditions that would  enable further production growth and reduction of unemployment.    [Kos] Both the prime minister and Finance Minister Mitja  Gaspari pointed out that the budget deficit must not exceed 1  percent of gross domestic product and that the government would  insist on that. Gaspari devoted his speech above all to  presenting basic aims and important points in the budget  documents for this year which will be discussed by the State  Council now.    [Gaspari] The estimate of the sources of revenue is  established on the basis of the current prices, provided the  planned price increase that I mentioned regarding the previous  (?implementation) is respected, so it is necessary to rearrange  the existing funds and not revenue from taxation in the possible  budget adjustments, unless the parliament decides for an  increase of budget deficit. I hope that it will not endorse  such a decision or proposal.    [Kos] Dr. France Arhar, governor of the Bank of Slovenia,  pointed out that the policy and aims that the central bank will  try to reach to a great extent depend on the decisions the  deputies will make when deciding about the budget and on the  level of the deficit they will endorse. The governor also said  that as we have gotten rid of hyperinflation, we shall now work  on abolishing the big state treasury [as heard].    [Arhar] And already this month, it plans to appear on the  market without this well-known iron formula, but with a new  instrument, a new monetary instrument and with a view to  starting a new practice and a new philosophy in this sphere.  Therefore, it will come up with a cost of money and creating  this cost, and with such parameters that are realistically  suitable to our competitors, the states with which Slovenia has  the highest trade.

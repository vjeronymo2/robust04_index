			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / UK Company News: NSM returns to the black and launches Pounds 40m rights NSM, the debt-laden international coal mining group, is more than trebling its equity with a heavily discounted rights issue to raise Pounds 40m. The cash call was accompanied by figures showing a recovery to pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.1m for the year to March 31 compared with losses of Pounds 9.8m. Mr John Jermine, executive chairman, said an injection of equity was required to complete the restructuring started three years ago which reversed the diversifications of the late 1980s. 'The refinancing will provide NSM with sufficient facilities to continue to develop its businesses and to assess the opportunities presented by the privatisation of British Coal.' NSM, which produced 1.6m tonnes of coal from opencast mines in the UK last year, might be interested in individual British Coal assets but is unlikely to venture outside its opencast expertise. Mr Jermine stressed: 'Any acquisitions will be bolt-on and we would not do anything that was not earnings enhancing.' Alongside the rights issue, which would reduce pro forma gearing from 158 per cent to 52 per cent at March 31, NSM's banks, led by Bank of Scotland, have agreed to provide 'substantial' new facilities. The terms of the rights issue are 5-for-2 at 100p compared with a market price of 174p, down 43p yesterday. Institutions accounting for 57 per cent of the shares are committed to taking up their rights with the remainder underwritten by Noble Grossart and Cazenove. Mr Jermine said the deep discount reflected the size of the issue, the company's 'difficult' history and the uncertain future facing the coal industry. But changes in the UK industry would also produce a 'lot of opportunities which have not crystallised yet'. Although NSM's UK tonnage dropped from 2m last year, the proportion sold direct to generators rose to a quarter as less lucrative contracts with British Coal declined. Sales from continuing operations slipped to Pounds 111.9m (Pounds 114.1m) producing operating profits before interest of Pounds 9.54m (Pounds 7.04m). Earnings per share were 12.3p (59.1p losses). COMMENT The rights issue will merely restore NSM's balance sheet to reasonable health rather than give it the muscle to take on allcomers in the break up of British Coal. For now the main strategy is to concentrate on reducing costs per tonne on both sides of the Atlantic. In the UK it should be helped by relaxation of restrictions on private operators - notably in the size of opencast sites - and in the US by recent capital investment in new reserves and drift mines. Thanks to the interest saving from the rights issue profits should top Pounds 6m this year. At the notional ex-rights price the shares are on a prospective multiple of about 14, reflecting the balance of opportunities and uncertainties.</p>

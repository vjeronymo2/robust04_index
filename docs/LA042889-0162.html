			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SESSIONS TO SNUB TWO FBI OFFICIALS IN FILLING NO. 2 POST  </P> <P> In a major shake-up at FBI headquarters, FBI Director William S. Sessions plans  to pass over senior FBI executives to fill the agency's long-vacant No. 2 post  and to tighten management because of growing dissatisfaction by Atty. Gen. Dick  Thornburgh, government sources said Thursday.  </P> <P> Sessions intends to elevate to the powerful associate director's post Floyd I.  Clarke, an official who had been promoted only two months ago to the top  management level. In doing so, he will bypass two veteran FBI officials who had  been considered possible heirs to the director's job.  </P> <P> Sessions has been meeting frequently with Thornburgh in recent weeks about the  attorney general's concerns that the bureau has not been moving quickly enough  to resolve management shortcomings, sources said.  </P> <P> Over the last year, the bureau has been sharply criticized for its treatment of  minority agents and for an investigation that allegedly violated the rights of  activists opposed to the Administration's El Salvador policies.  </P> <P> Thornburgh has approved the elevation of Clarke and related moves, but word of  the shifts has been held so tightly that some of the principals said Thursday  that they had not heard of the changes. Announcement of the action in the next  few weeks is expected to be a bombshell at the FBI.  </P> <P> The management shifts are coming after reports that Thornburgh was searching  for a way to ease Sessions out and that he had considered recommending him for  a vacancy on the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. Thornburgh, however, denied  those reports.  </P> <P> Oliver B. Revell, one of the senior officials passed over, oversees all FBI  investigations. John Otto, the other official not promoted, had served as  acting director before Sessions took command of the agency in November, 1987.  </P> <P> Revell and Otto are 50 and thus eligible for full retirement under FBI rules.  Otto said that Sessions had not discussed Clarke's appointment with him and  that "I enjoy what I'm doing here." Revell could not be reached.  </P> <P> In other shifts approved by Thornburgh, Sessions has downgraded the office of  congressional and public affairs and is having each of those functions report  separately to him. Milton Ahlerich, who has headed the joint office as  assistant director, is expected to be named a special agent in charge of one of  the bureau's 58 field offices, which an official noted is "the next logical  step in his career."  </P> <P> Clarke, 47, was a deputy under Revell in 1982 when Revell headed the FBI's  criminal investigative division. When Revell was promoted to executive  assistant director in 1985, Clarke took over the criminal investigative  division -- the FBI's highest-profile unit. In February, Clarke was named to  one of the three executive assistant director posts.  </P> <P> On April 5, Sessions brought William Baker back from the CIA as assistant  director in charge of the criminal division. Baker, a veteran FBI official, had  moved to the CIA with former FBI Director William H. Webster when he became  head of the CIA.  </P> <P> Clarke, who has been with the FBI for 25 years, served as assistant special  agent in charge of the FBI's Philadelphia office and headed the bureau's Kansas  City office before moving to headquarters in 1982.  </P></p>

			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Granada defends Plowright decision MR ALEX Bernstein, chairman of Granada Group yesterday had to justify at its annual meeting the forced resignation of Mr David Plowright, chairman of Granada Television. As the meeting was drawing to an end, with the time for questions already over, Mrs Patricia Davies, a shareholder and former producer on the University Challenge television programme, said she wanted some explanation for the departure. Mr Plowright had always been associated with high quality, she said. Mr Bernstein replied that while he understood the concern it was a team not an individual that had won the new franchise for Granada. 'I am quite confident that Granada Television can continue to carry out the terms of the franchise satisfactorily,' he said adding that all ITV companies were having to look at their cost structures. Granada Television could be no exception. Mr Gerry Robinson, the new chief executive who sought Mr Plowright's resignation, said although the departure was very unfortunate it was 'absolutely vital' to have straight-talking from a new chief executive on what was required from every part of the group in terms of better profits for shareholders and employees. There had been a lack of consistent dialogue with Mr Plowright. 'I was sad about that but it could not be allowed to get in the way of nursing the company back to health,' Mr Robinson said. Mr Bernstein was attacked by Mr David Boulton, former head of arts and regional programmes at Granada, for 'giving in to pressure from others' in getting rid of Mr Plowright. 'Our dismay and concern is all the greater when the axemanship is done by a new chief executive whose quality record in the business he ran before is deplorable,' Mr Boulton said. He added that Compass, the industrial catering group run by Mr Robinson, had lost contract after contract. Mr Robinson said that Compass had won caterer of the year awards and said he was dedicated to quality. 'I believe totally in quality and I have no time at all for people who confuse spending with quality,' said Mr Robinson to a round of applause. Earlier there had been complaints about the size of payments to directors and in particular the Pounds 579,550 pay-off to Mr Derek Lewis, the former chief executive. Mr Bernstein said Mr Lewis had been paid his entitlement under his contract. See Observer</p>

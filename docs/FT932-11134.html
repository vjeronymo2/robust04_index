			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Serbs seek to impose conditions on Bosnian peace plan: You cannot oppose and fight the entire world, warns Greek premier THE BOSNIAN Serb assembly was last night moving towards the adoption of a document listing nine conditions for the acceptance of the international peace plan on Bosnia. A vote for such a document would almost certainly be viewed by the US and its western allies as a rejection of the plan, brokered by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the UN and European Community mediators. As the 82 deputies of the self-styled parliament continued their debate into the early hours of the morning, President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and President Dobrica Cosic of the rump Yugoslavia made a dramatic appeal to the deputies to adopt the plan without qualifications. 'We can't help you any more,' they said, warning that the assembly's intended action would provoke military intervention. Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, prime minister of Greece, a traditional ally of Orthodox Serbia, warned the delegates: 'You cannot oppose and fight the entire world.' Mr Dragan Kalinic, health minister of the self-proclaimed Serb Republic in Bosnia, said the parliament meeting in the mountain stronghold of Pale near Sarajevo, 'would vote 'yes' to the plan but with conditions'. These were contained in a draft document to be voted on by the assembly and included the abolition of international sanctions against Yugoslavia within three weeks as well as changes in the Vance-Owen map which would link Serb provinces of Bosnia. At the vital session of the Bosnian Serb parliament, bitter divisions emerged over whether to accept the plan or reject it and face possible punitive air strikes from the US and its allies. Diplomatic observers believed that most of the Bosnian Serb conditions, if confirmed, would be rejected by the international community. The US, Britain and France have all stressed that sanctions must remain in place until it was absolutely clear that the Bosnian Serbs were implementing the peace plan as agreed. Moreover, the international mediators, who have proposed dividing Bosnia into 10 semi-autonomous provinces, have always been careful to avoid drawing a map which would enable the Bosnian Serbs to consolidate their territory and declare a separate state. The Bosnian Serbs, on the other hand, have never concealed their long-term aim of subsuming such a state in a Greater Serbia. Other conditions contained in the document included a land swap with the Croats, the right of Serb minorities in Croat and Moslem provinces to vote on whether they should join neighbouring Serb provinces, and the provision that 50 per cent of UN troops deployed along confrontation lines come from Orthodox countries. Meanwhile, the US and Russia yesterday glossed over their differences on Bosnia to present a united front after talks in Moscow between Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, his Russian opposite number. The two sides issued a bullish joint statement, in which they said they were both prepared to commit 'appropriate' military forces to a peacekeeping operation. Background Page 2</p>

In a public declaration, the Mapuche Meli Wixan Mapu  Coordinating Board states that the campesino revolt in southern  Mexico is due to "centuries of political, economic, and cultural  oppression," and it indicates that "this uprising is the answer  to a slow process of ethnical-cultural death."    The declaration adds that Mexico's becoming a member of  NAFTA  "has condemned the Mayan peoples to death" because their  production techniques "do not allow them to be competitive" with  U.S. and Canadian markets, and this is causing "the extinction  of those peoples."    The Mapuche group then makes a call to the International Red  Cross, the Inter-American Human Rights Commission, and the UN's  human rights organization to visit the Chiapas combat zone "in  order to guarantee the integrity" of the indigenous peoples  involved.    Coordinating board leaders Dagoberto Cachana and Alihuen  Antileo announced that on 6 January the document will be handed  to the Mexican Embassy in Santiago.</p>

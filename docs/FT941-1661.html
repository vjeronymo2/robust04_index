			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Arts: Odd Soviet bedfellows - Music The Russians keep coming, from all musical directions. Since the Soviet Union was wound up, not only have ex-Soviet performers flooded the Western market, but ex-Soviet composers too. There is an eager Western conviction that their most original music must have been suppressed under Communism. Hence the sedulously democratic attention given nowadays alike to the visionary Sofia Gubaidulina, to knotty Edison Denisov, the maverick Alfred Schnittke and the pious minimalist Arvo Part - and to anything by Prokofiev or Shostakovich that went down badly with the old regime. On Tuesday at the Barbican, the ex-Soviet Alexander Lazarev took the BBC Symphony through an excellent programme of just such oddly-matched bedfellows. First we heard Wingless, a recent work by Giya Kancheli, a 59-year-old Georgian who like the Estonian Part remembers ancient chant, but subsumes it into an unhurried meditative flow, barely varied, more like recent Gorecki or John Tavener. In Wingless, chorale-fragments alternate steadily with fluttery motifs like shepherd's pipes or birdcalls. It went on for some 25 minutes; the mind wandered, drowsily and pleasantly. Then Dmitri Alexeev came on to deliver Nikolai Medtner's Piano Concerto no. 1 (1918) with all the tingling energy needed to keep its 19th-century virtuoso writing airborne, the intimate feeling for its introspective passages, and the brains to set its tough, conservative structure in clean relief. A welcome rediscovery; but all that was anti-Soviet about Medtner - a refined neo-Brahmsian - was his reverence for Western musical models, and his early departure from Russia to Paris and thence to Golders Green. Russian pianists have been cultivating his music for many years now. The 19-year-old Shostakovich's astonishing First Symphony (1925), which Lazarev expounded in swift, clean lines that left ample room for the first-desk BBC players to bring their solos to poignant life, was actually a 'Soviet' triumph long before the clampdown by Stalin and Khrennikov. Though we hear tragic tensions in it, they cannot have had much to do with the composer's later, well-founded political anxieties. As for Prokofiev's Eugene Onegin scene-music (1936, for a dramatisation of Pushkin's verse-novel which was officially thwarted), Edward Downes's devoted restoration and revival on Monday with the Docklands Sinfonietta and a team of actors revealed it as moderately interesting, but broken-backed. The composer would soon recycle the best parts to more developed effect, in Cinderella, War and Peace and his Seventh Symphony. Here we had costumed players reading bits of Onegin, Lensky and Tatyana over the orchestra, very well - but no Olga, nor any dancers at the two grand balls for which Prokofiev designed several of his 44 numbers. Though this 'semi-staged' version was less than a dramatisation, it occupied a long 2 hours and 40 minutes. The director Timothy West also took pawky relish in the lengthy narration, in Sir Charles Johnston's rhymed couplets. Rather soon the strenuous hunt for rhymes grew irritating, like the suppression of articles for scansion's sake - 'avert his chest from pistol's click': shades of 'Pyramus and Thisbe'] I think Prokofiev's robustly plain Onegin score wants full-dress staging with a brighter text, or else to be left alone.</p>

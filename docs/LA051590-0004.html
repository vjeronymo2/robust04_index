			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JURY VERDICT ON HOSTAGE ISSUE  </P> <P> A jury in Portland found Richard J. Brenneke not guilty on five counts of lying  when he told a judge that indeed Reagan-Bush officials asked Iran not to  release the hostages until after the election in 1980.  </P> <P> As the Church Lady on "Saturday Night Live" would say, "How convenient!" Have  Iran keep the hostages so all the blame can go to Jimmy Carter and he will most  assuredly lose the election.  </P> <P> All this is not news, except to the "liberal press" who apparently dropped the  ball on this one. Does the press really believe that Iran-Contra was just a  happenstance? No, guys, the groundwork was laid years before.  </P> <P> JOANNE C. MURRAY  </P> <P> Santa Barbara  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ICAHN PLANS TO SLASH NUMBER OF PLANES AND FLIGHTS AT TWA  </P> <P> Trans World Airlines Chairman Carl C. Icahn said he plans to eliminate service  to seven cities and sell or mothball 15 aircraft by October under an aggressive  downsizing plan aimed at returning the carrier to profitability.  </P> <P> Icahn said a 7% reduction in TWA's flight hours would be implemented because he  has been unsuccessful in obtaining pay and benefit concessions from the  airline's 3,500 pilots.  </P> <P> He has said since January that he might shrink the troubled airline unless  pilots agree to $80 million a year in wage and benefit cuts.  </P> <P> "You can't keep losing $250 million a year," he said in a telephone interview.  "I'm not going to let TWA bleed to death and end up like Pan Am or Eastern."  </P> <P> A TWA spokesman identified Madison, Wis., and Nassau and Freeport in the  Bahamas, which are considered domestic flights, as three of the cities to be  cut. Icahn declined to identify the rest.  </P> <P> TWA reported a first-quarter net loss of $143 million, compared to a net loss  of $83.1 million a year earlier.  </P></p>

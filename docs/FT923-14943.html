			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Program your life - Computing / Personal information managers ONE OF the problems of modern life is keeping all the information you require at your fingertips. The Filofax, or personal organiser, was a possible answer to this dilemma. It was portable and it allowed you to make notes, keep a diary and an address book all within one compact booklet. But it had a great failing: it was difficult to cross reference the information. I found that trying to retrieve the information I needed was a constant headache. And, when re-organising my notes to make it more accessible, invariably one side of the page had notes about one subject and the other had information about some totally unrelated topic. Often I spent hours rearranging the notes rather than using the time productively. An increasing proportion of the working population now has a computer at its desks, or a portable computer which they carry around. The Filofax is becoming rather passe. Computer companies make great play of the machines' ability to store massed, structured data. A high proportion of computer software is designed for one of four tasks: word-processing, database management, spreadsheets and accounts. These are fine for manipulating large amounts of data, be it in the form of word-processed documents, complex work sheets for repetitive calculations, or information that can fit into a list structure. Until recently, there has been little for storing, in a usable fashion, the snippets of information we gather day-to-day. Now, instead of a personal organiser resting on my desk my diary, address book and notepad are kept within the computer. The type of software I use has a generic team of personal information managers or, as acronym assemblers will have it, PIMs. The advantage is the PIMs' ability to search for character strings. PIMs can search across the whole range of features. If you wrote a note in your diary instead of the notetaker, the PIM will find it for you. Many also offer direct links between diary schedules and notebook text. You may arrange a meeting to discuss a particular proposal and enter it into the diary section. A linked note to that diary entry may contain the agenda for the meeting as well as more detailed information of the proposal. PIMs are personal tools. They are designed to keep track of an individual's personal store of information. A PIM can be anything from a simple notetaker to a small scale project management package. People use PIMs in very different ways. Therefore, the term covers software packages which differ widely in the features they offer. Some might switch to a PIM only occasionally and exploit it for little more than jotting down random thoughts and noting telephone calls - others might keep the PIM running all day as the main program they use on their computer. And, where one person may use it to keep a record of his or her activities, another may be using it for managing others. These diverse uses have led suppliers to two competing strategies. At one end of the spectrum are products which are complex but can be adapted to an individual's particular needs. At the other end are packages deliberately limited in their range of features. The approach of the latter is simplicity of use. The original PIM, Sidekick - released in 1984 - was a surprising success. It offered users the chance to clear their desks of the paraphernalia of day-to-day life and the ability to call up a diary, notepad, calculator and address list with just a couple of keystrokes while still running the main application. As soon as you had completed the Sidekick task you could drop back to where you left off in the spreadsheet, database or word-processor you were using. Sidekick has had many competitors since - many offering the same facilities - and others which took a rather different formula for the amenities they offered. In the past couple of years there has been much written in computer journals about the Windows Graphical User Interface (GUl). It has advantages beyond the ease-of-use that is often mooted. These are well demonstrated where the personal information manager is concerned. A PIM works best when it is constantly available. The Windows environment allows several programs to be available at the same time. On more high-powered computer systems several programs can run at a time - a facility called multi-tasking. Microsoft Windows also allows graphics which duplicate such things as index cards, calendars and even standard, six-hole, Filofax paper. By offering applications which look similar to their paper-based forebears many software producers hope to increase their market. Another PIMs platform is the hand-held, or palm-top computer. Though not as powerful as desktop or notebook computers they present a reasonable alternative for lightweight everyday tasks. Most offer some form of note input as well as the all-important searches. Many pocket portables offer easy connection to more powerful desktop machines. Any personal information manager only works as well as the data it holds. It takes some initial effort to remember to enter each phone call and appointment into the computer. But, once you have overcome this block, it can pay handsome dividends. Some PIMs work to their best only if they take over your life. Others are quite happy to take advantage of any information given to them. From this it follows that a PIM is not much use unless it does what you want and in the way you want. As with all software the onus is on the user to select the right package.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Wuhan, June 22 (XINHUA) -- Central China's Hubei  Province recently opened eight new tours to attract more  overseas holidaymakers.    The new tours will bring visitors to the home town of  Quyuan,  one of the greatest ancient Chinese poets; the battlefields  related in "The Story of Three Kingdoms", one of the greatest  Chinese historical novels; the chime bells, an ancient Chinese  musical instrument; the best-preserved ancient town of Jingzhou;  the marvelous martial arts (gongfu) of the monks of Wudang  Mountain; and other great local natural and historical places of  interest.    Later this year, the province will hold a Three-Gorges Art  Festival, an international acrobatic festival and an exhibition  of Taoism [Daoism] culture, which the tourism authority hopes  will bring more visitors from overseas.</p>

			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / UK Company News: AF Budge put into receivership by banks AF BUDGE, the privately owned construction group and the sixth largest road builder in Britain, has been put into receivership by its bankers, writes Paul Taylor. Mr Tony Budge, chairman of the group which has an annual turnover of Pounds 150m, said the banks' decision had come as a surprise. 'What we needed was some confidence and the sun to shine, instead of that we ran into a brick wall,' he said. Although the group had suffered as a result of the slump in the construction sector, and had to carry the burden of an unlet office block in London's Docklands costing Pounds 6m a year, Mr Budge said: 'We thought we could see clear water for the first time.' The group had used the proceeds from the management buy-out of its open-cast coal mining division earlier this year to repay Pounds 11m of subordinated debt and bank loans, including a Pounds 35m unsecured loan from Barclays. The latter was replaced by a Pounds 20m loan facility provided by a syndicate of three banks, including Barclays. The group had reached the limit of this borrowing facility, but Mr Budge said the two institutional shareholders, Charterhouse and Prudential, had made new proposals to the syndicate. However, it appears the banks could not agree on the proposal. As a result Coopers &amp; Lybrand partners were appointed as receivers by County NatWest, acting as agent for the syndicate, which also included the Royal Bank of Scotland. Budge was due to sponsor today's big National Hunt horse race at Cheltenham. But Mr Tony Budge, who is a member of the Jockey Club, decided to end his connections with the sport after the receivers were called on Thursday. Mr George Ward, of Grunwick, has stepped in to sponsor the race, which will be known as the Tripleprint Gold Cup.</p>

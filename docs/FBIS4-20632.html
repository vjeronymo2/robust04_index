			<p>CSO     [Text] The National Institute of Materials and Chemical  Research (NIMC) of the Agency of Industrial Science and  Technology (AIST) has developed a new separation/recovery  technology for high purity carbon nanotubes that now are  attracting attention as future large scale advanced materials.  Carbon nanotubes are expected to have a variety of properties.  They can be synthesized only with high levels of impurities,  therefore, it has been difficult to make precise property  evaluations. They are still in the basic research stage, but  nanotubes of "above 99 percent purity" are expected, according  to the NIMC. The latest development is likely to attract  considerable attention because it may represent substantial  progress in research on the properties of carbon nanotubes.    Development was carried out by Chief Researchers Morio  Yumura  and Kunio Uchida of the Reaction Engineering Lab at the  Department of Chemical Systems of the NIMC.    Carbon nanotubes are contained in the substances deposited  on  the cathode when the starter material graphite is heated at a  high temperature by arc discharge. However, this substance  contains a large amount of graphite-like material and amorphous  carbon impurities in addition to carbon nanotubes.    The currently known separation/refinery technology for  carbon  nanotubes involves dipping a coarsely ground substance in  ethanol. Carbon nanotubes are recovered from the supernatant  ethanol after supersonic waves are applied. However, this  conventional separation/refinery method leaves impurities, and  the presence of those impurities has hindered precise property  evaluations.    The new technology calls for further fine pulverization of  the carbon nanotubes and impurities in supernatant ethanol to  loosen them all up.    Next, the pulverized substances are taken out of the ethanol  and put into water containing dispersant and then placed in a  centrifugal separator. The supernatant liquid produced at this  time is put through a filter.    At this stage, most of the amorphous carbon is eliminated,  but a small amount of graphite-like substances remain. And so,  finally, they are sintered at a high temperature, about  750C, to eliminate the graphite-like substances.    Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation of the  remaining substances revealed the separation of carbon nanotubes  that contained almost no impurities.</p>

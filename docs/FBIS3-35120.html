Nursultan Nazarbayev  told correspondents in New York yesterday: Unfortunately the  U.S. Administration's attitude toward the Iranian Government is  negative. But Kazakhstan oes not believe in isolating Iran,  which enjoys special importance in northern and central Asian  affairs. The Kazakh president pointed out that Almaty's  relations with Tehran are extremely good and constructive and  that despite all the bad propaganda by enemies, the two  countries are expanding their relations.    Nazarbayev rejected allegations of a threat from Islamic  fundamentalism in the Central Asian republics and stressed: We  are all Muslims and respect Islamic beliefs. After having lived  through the antireligious years in the former Soviet Union, the  people in the Central Asian republics are extremely interested  in returning to their religious beliefs. Nevertheless, he  added, in Kazakhstan religion and politics are kept separate.    The Kazakh president described the Economic Cooperation  Organization, ECO, as a good example of successful regional  cooperation for the world.    Referring to the agreements between Washington and Almaty,  he  said that the two countries have concluded agreements in the  political, economic, scientific, technological, and defense  fields as well as in the joint use of Kazakhstan's space center,  and that the United States has promised $300 million in aid to  Kazakhstan.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] A general election has been  threatened in the event of the government majority not  controlling both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies. This  morning, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro commented on this.    [Unidentified correspondent] To threaten to partially or  completely dissolve parliament would be a serious error because  it would impinge on the head of state's legal competence. This  is how the president's office has replied to members of the  majority parties who stressed the problems the new government  would have if there were two different majorities in the two  chambers of parliament. In the face of this criticism, Forza  Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi has sought to clarify his  position:    [Begin Berlusconi recording] I said that it was clear that  in  order for a government to govern it must have the two chambers  of parliament on its side. If the situation were to arise in  one of the two chambers where a majority close to the government  could not be found, it would be impossible to govern. [end  recording]    According to the Northern League's Roberto Maroni, who has  made the same points as Berlusconi, the presidency has not  understood the gist of his argument. He has denied threatening  to dissolve parliament.    Christian Democratic Center party leader Pierferdinando  Casinis said his were only political observations.    For the Progressive Alliance, Achille Occhetto [Democratic  Party of the Left leader] commented:    [Begin Occhetto recording] I think it was his duty. The head  of state has simply said that only he and no one else can  dissolve parliament. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

His plane crashed in territory controlled by Bosnian Serbs  between Kljuc and Sanski Most, about 60 kilometers (35 miles)  west of Banja Luka, from where the Serb planes had flown out,  according to the paper. It gave no other details on the pilot's  whereabouts or condition.    The pilots of the three other craft are believed to have  been  killed when their planes were shot down early Monday during  missions to attack Moslem positions, one crashing near Bosanski  Petrovac and the other two near Mrkonjic Grad, both about 60  kilometers south and southwest of Banja Luka.    The paper said the plane that went down near Bosanski  Petrovac had carried out its bombing mission over Bihac, a  Moslem enclave in western Bosnia under siege by Bosnian Serbs,  since it had no bombs on board when it crashed.    POLITIKA, which gave no sources for its information, said  eight Bosnian Serb planes in all had taken off Monday morning  but only five continued on with their bombing mission. The  flights were in violation of a ban on military flights over  Bosnia decreed by the United Nations in April 1993.    Bosnian Serb forces have denied that the planes shot down by  the North Atlantic Treaty Organization were part of their air  force or that they had taken off from Banja Luka airport, where  UN observers are posted.    The Belgrade-based TANJUG news agency meanwhile said the  four  UN observers assigned to monitoring Banja Luka airport were  staying some 30 kilometers (20 miles) from the site and said  their vehicles had recently been stolen.</p>

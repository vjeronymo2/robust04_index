			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Letter: Windfall tax would not help unemployment Sir, The proposal by the Labour party that utilities should 'pay a public dividend (windfall tax) as a result of their excess profits' (Parliament and Politics, January 20) to help generate jobs shows a basic misunderstanding of the finances of the water industry. More than 70 per cent of Wessex Water's profits are used to help fund new capital investment programmes. Our total expenditure each year exceeds our income by a considerable margin. Every day Wessex Water spends around Pounds 300,000 on new capital schemes to meet legally required higher standards and to put right neglect of the past. This expenditure generates thousands of jobs. While wholeheartedly supporting the desire to reduce unemployment, as far as the water industry is concerned, the Labour party's proposals would have the opposite effect.

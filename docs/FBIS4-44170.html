			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nur-al-Din al-Furaydi: "Algerian Prime Minister </F> in Belgium; He Has Been Informed of Support for Dialogue and  Reforms"]    [Excerpts] Brussels -- Algerian Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi  has confirmed the U.S. Administration's and the European Union's  support for the political dialogue and economic reforms  endeavors Algerian authorities are making. In an exclusive  statement to AL-HAYAH following a meeting he held at noon on  Tuesday [21 June] with his Belgian opposite number, Jean-Luc  Dehaene, who is nominated to succeed [European] Commission  President Jacques Delors, he said that Foreign Minister Mohamed  Salah Dembri, who is currently in the United States, has  informed him of the support of President Bill Clinton's  administration for the Algerian Government's endeavors vis-a-vis  the political dialogue with all the parties renouncing violence  as a means to reach power. [passage omitted]    In his statement to AL-HAYAH Mokdad Sifi stressed his  government's determination to continue the political dialogue.  He indicated that he is not banking on achieving a political  "miracle" in the near future, "because dialogue is a long  process and requires time. And the Algerian Government is  awaiting the participation of the parties which have been late"  in joining the Transitional National Council.    On the continuation of the dialogue with the detained  Islamic  Salvation Front leaders, Mokdad Sifi said that the Transitional  Council "is the framework organizing the dialogue among the  parties and influential figures who respect the Constitution and  the country's laws and who openly declare their renunciation of  violence. The dialogue is aimed at committing all parties in  the country to working to improve the economic and social  situation so that Algerians can proceed with free and democratic  elections as soon as possible in order to choose the men who are  going to lead the country, God willing."    Mokdad Sifi met the day before yesterday with members of the  Algerian community in Brussels. He answered questions some of  which dealt with the situation in the country. He told an  elderly immigrant: "Power is for the people and God." And that  the current leadership is supervising a transitional phase to  normalize the political situation and reform the economy, then  hold free parliamentary elections.    On the contacts made between Islamic Front [leaders] in  exile  and some European capitals and Washington, Sifi said that the  official U.S. position announced by President Bill Clinton in  Paris "condemns violence and supports the dialogue the Algerian  Government is leading. Foreign Minister Mohamed Salah Dembri,  who is currently in Washington, has stressed in contacts with  him that the U.S. Administration fully supports the Algerian  Government's endeavors vis-a-vis the political dialogue and  economic reforms."    He pointed out that the European Union has "on numerous  occasions supported the Algerian Government's endeavors in the  economic and political spheres." He said that he had raised  with his Belgian opposite number prospects for relations between  the European Union and Algeria "in a manner that takes account  of current changes in Algeria. And there is political consensus  with the Belgian prime minister that the European Union's  borders do not end at the northern waters of the Mediterranean  and that there can be no southern bank without the Arab Maghreb,  in which Algeria represents a major party." He said that they  are agreed that "the situation in Algeria affects Europe at all  levels, economic, political, and geopolitical." [passage  omitted]    Sifi said that the agreements Algeria has signed with the  IMF  will save until next May the payment of $5 billion. He pointed  out that loans his country is going to obtain from international  monetary establishment, commercial banks, and the European Union  "will enable it to import raw material to revive the economy and  to import consumer goods." He expected economic growth to reach  3 percent this year and 6 percent next year. He pointed to the  importance of the projects of reactivating small and medium  establishments, agricultural investment, and building dams and  houses, and also major projects like constructing 3,000-km-long  railroads, as these projects will increase employment  opportunities.    Sifi said that the government has taken measures which have  received the IMF's approval to protect social groups with  limited income against the consequences that usually result from  the process of liberalizing the economy, especially in the areas  of housing, education, and health. And to control the prices of  some basic commodities. The European Commission will donate  grants to finance projects that will help the government to  implement the public housing program. The Algerian Government  is banking on increasing gas imports in the long term from the  current rate of 30 billion to 60 billion cubic meters by 1998 --  which would secure additional financial revenue to finance the  development program.</p>

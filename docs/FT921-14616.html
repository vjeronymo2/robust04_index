			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Philippines in investment fund talks THE Philippines is negotiating with multilateral lending agencies and foreign governments to create a Dollars 100m investment fund for private companies carrying out projects under the country's build-operate-transfer (Bot) scheme, Reuter reports from Manila. Under the Bot scheme, private investors undertake capital-intensive infrastructure projects, turning them over to the government later. The planned revolving credit facility would fund 20 per cent to 30 per cent of the total cost of a project, said Mr Rogelio Singson, director of the committee overseeing the Philippine Assistance Programme. 'It will send a clear message the government is behind the Bot programme,' he said. The fund, to be run by state-owned Development Bank of the Philippines, is meant to be in place by the second half of 1992, he said. Manila has approached the World Bank, International Finance Corp, the Asian Development Bank and the US and Japanese governments for funding, he said. Guidelines for the programme were expected by June. The Philippines is encouraging the Bot programme due to a lack of government resources. 'One of the ways of minimising the load is for the government to allow private investments in infrastructure projects,' Mr Jesus Estanislao, finance secretary, told a forum on Bot and privatisation.</p>

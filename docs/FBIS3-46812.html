This stand was manifested in the "declaration on the  situation" adopted at an enlarged meeting of the standing  committee of the Central Committee of Hanminjon, according to  Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation.    The "declaration on the situation" says:    "The Kim Yong-sam regime born of the womb of the `sixth  republic' under the `civilian' veil loudly advertised `changes'  and `reform' for 10 months after its appearance. But nothing  but the sediment of the military dictatorship remains and there  is nothing done for the people.    "There is no ruler of South Korea who did not serve the  United States as its stooge. But there was no such stooge as  Kim Yong-sam who got the promise of the U.S. to leave its forces  in South Korea in reward for his role of a `shockbrigade' in  executing its `plan of a new Pacific community' and offered  human and material resources wholly to it as strategic supplies.    "Today the traitor Kim Yong-sam relinquished the demand for  the liquidation of the Japanese imperialists' colonial past and  compensation to `comfort women for the army' and has flung the  door wide open for the reinvasion of the Japanese reactionaries  who are trying to become a military power and a nuclear power.    "Owing to these treacherous acts of the Kim Yong-sam group,  the dialogue and exchange which took place even under the  military dictatorship of the `sixth republic' has been  completely stopped, the North-South agreements remain mere  sheets of paper, the North-South relations have been totally  frozen and dark clouds of a nuclear war hanging over the heads  of the nation. It is the general view of our people that the  treacherous Kim Yong-sam regime must no longer be left alone."    The declaration calls for overthrowing the sham civilian  "government", establishing a genuine independent and democratic  government and putting the movement for independence, democracy  and reunification on its track.    The declaration also calls for achieving the unity of the  patriotic, democratic forces to fight till they have  fundamentally removed colonial domination, fascist dictatorship  and national division and won independence, democracy and  reunification.</p>

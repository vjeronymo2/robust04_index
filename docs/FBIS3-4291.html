			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gert Anhalt including statements by PRC Foreign </F> Ministry Spokesman Wu Jianmin in Chinese with superimposed  German translation; place and date not given -- recorded]    [Excerpt] Do they have the bomb or are they just bluffing?  Actually, this is not the most important thing just now. North  Korea, the eternal outsider of the international community, has  finally maneuvered itself into a corner and is standing with its  back to a wall. The question now is, can the Korea crisis be  settled peacefully or is a conflict unavoidable?    China could have the answer to that. China is the only  country that has good contacts with Pyongyang and with Seoul --  the ideal mediator, therefore.    Therefore, South Korea's President Kim Young Sam hopes for  diplomatic support during his visit to Beijing. However, PRC  President Jiang Zemin told him only what he had told to the  worried Japanese Prime Minister Hosokawa a week ago: China  relies on patient negotiations. China does not want any  pressure on North Korea.    Wu Jianmin, spokesman of the Chinese Foreign Ministry says:    [Begin Wu Jianmin recording] Political pressure or even  sanctions would just escalate the current tensions and make the  situation even more complicated. China is in contact with all  parties involved, but our influence is limited, and we do not  want to interfere in the negotiations. The dialogue must be  held between North Korea on the one side and the IAEA  [International Atomic Energy Agency], the United States, and  South Korea on the other. Of course, China wants stability in  Korea and we do not want nuclear weapons there -- be it in the  north or in the south. [end recording]    If North Korea is working on the bomb in its nuclear  facilities, this cannot be a matter of indifference to China.  It does not want a new nuclear power in its neighborhood, in  particular because South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan could arm  themselves with nuclear weapons within the shortest possible  period out of fear of North Korea. The strategic balance in  eastern Asia, which is still to China's advantage at the moment,  would be lastingly disturbed.    Therefore, some see the reason for Beijing's  imperturbability  in the fact that the Chinese intelligence service knows more  than the West, which has only some satellite pictures. Perhaps  China knows that North Korea will not be able to produce nuclear  weapons for a long time to come.    Perhaps, however, China is still loyal to the fraternal  communist country. In the Korean war, half a million Chinese  soldiers died on Kim Il-song's side, and in China's leadership  there are still the old revolutionaries, who have not forgotten  that.    However, whatever the reason, the official justification is:  China does not interfere, particularly not when sanctions are  threatened.    [Begin Wu Jianmin recording] I give you an example that  explains why China insists on finding a solution by means of  negotiations. This is just as with Chinese herbal medicine. It  needs a very long time to have an effect, just as negotiations.  If you treat an illness with herbs, the healing process might  take longer, but in the end, it might be much better than to  have precipitate surgery. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

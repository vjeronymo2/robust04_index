			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE HIGH SCHOOLS;  </P> <P> THOUGH ROYAL'S JONES HIT A BATTER, HIS PITCHES ALL PROVED UNHITTABLE  </P> <P> James Jones of Royal High came within one inside fastball of a perfect game in  Monday's no-hitter against St. Monica.  </P> <P> The Highlanders won, 5-0, behind 13 strikeouts by Jones, who made only 79  pitches -- 53 were strikes -- in the seven-inning game at Marine Field in Santa  Monica. The one that got away was a fastball that hit a St. Monica batter with  one out in the fifth inning.  </P> <P> Jones pitched so well that, of the 13 strikeouts, 10 were in situations in  which the batter was caught looking.  </P> <P> "His fastball was really moving on the inside of the plate," Royal Coach Mike  McCurdy said. "It was exciting. We needed that type of a game."  </P> <P> Jones also had three hits in as many at-bats as Royal improved to 3-3. "He had  a career in one night," McCurdy said with a laugh.  </P> <P> Interestingly, Jones pitched Monday only because he was unable to last weekend  when he was still feeling the effects of the flu.  </P> <P> His eyes are on Texas: Gregg Zaun wouldn't be specific, but it's going to take  quite an offer to lure the St. Francis catcher from the University of Texas. He  already has orally committed to the Longhorns.  </P> <P> "It's going to take a pretty good offer from a pro team to give that up," Zaun  said. "The money I want you just don't see in somebody my size, and the draft  is pretty much size-oriented."  </P> <P> Zaun stands 5-foot-10 and weighs 165 pounds, which he figures is the perfect  size for a Longhorn.  </P> <P> "I always wanted to go to Texas, anyway, and when I went there it was  everything I expected and more," he said.  </P> <P> While in Austin a couple of weeks ago, he saw Texas beat UCLA twice. Zaun also  was impressed with the atmosphere.  </P> <P> "The field was great and the fans were really into the game," Zaun said.  "Longhorn sports are really popular."  </P> <P> Taking offense: Chatsworth might have got out of the gate a little slowly, but  the offense cannot be blamed for the Chancellors' 3-2 record.  </P> <P> With a team batting average of .314 through five games, Chatsworth has  outscored the opposition, 55-24, and has posted lopsided wins of 19-2 over  Ventura, 13-5 over Rio Mesa and 12-2 over Hueneme.  </P> <P> Chatsworth, which finished third in the Blue Division of the Westside  tournament, has had an eight-run inning, a 10-run inning and an 11-run inning.  </P> <P> Against Rio Mesa, a grand slam by shortstop Jason Evans, coupled with a two-run  home run by catcher Eric Johnson, highlighted an eight-run eighth inning that  snapped a 5-5 tie.  </P> <P> Against Hueneme, 13 batters came to the plate in the third inning as Chatsworth  broke a scoreless tie with 10 runs. Senior Nick Schultz had a leadoff single  and a three-run double in the inning.  </P> <P> Senior center fielder Kevin Chong is batting a team-high .562 (nine for 16) and  Evans is batting .437 with two home runs and a team-high 11 runs batted in.  </P> <P> Evans, Johnson and pitcher-first baseman Derek Wallace each have hit two home  runs.  </P> <P> Strikeout leaders: A year ago as juniors, Roland De La Maza of St. Genevieve  and Roger Salkeld of Saugus shared the Valley-area lead with 126 strikeouts.  And the two right-handed starters are off to fast starts as seniors.  </P> <P> Salkeld has 43 strikeouts and has not allowed an earned run through 23 innings.  He has pitched three complete games -- a one-hitter with 13 strikeouts in a 6-0  win over Gahr; a three-hitter with 19 strikeouts in nine innings against  Crespi, a 1-1 tie called because of darkness; and a two-hitter and 11  strikeouts in a 2-0 win against Santa Clara.  </P> <P> After giving up three earned runs and losing in the season opener against  Quartz Hill, De La Maza struck out 18 in nine innings last week and allowed  eight hits (seven singles, one double). During one stretch, De La Maza struck  out 13 of 14 batters.  </P> <P> Kennedy left-hander Denny Sharp showed signs of rivaling those two for  strikeout honors. The 5-10 junior has 31 strikeouts in 15 innings, including 14  in a 22-2 win over Camarillo on Saturday.  </P> <P> Belt-high fastball: Taft catcher Adam Zutler launched what some observers  claimed was a 450-foot home run Saturday against Santa Monica. But that's  stretching the tape measure, according to Coach Rich McKeon. "Four-fifteen was  more like it," he said. "But it was up high and it went far."  </P> <P> Master thieves: St. Genevieve (2-1) has stolen 22 bases in 26 attempts, but  Coach Kevin Kane does not attribute such success to blazing speed.  </P> <P> "It's not like we're the St. Louis Cardinals," he said. "But because we're a  young team, I've taught the kids to be really aggressive."  </P> <P> Advancing to second base on a walk, going from second to third on a wild-pitch  strikeout and converting double steals are examples of the Valiants' attacking  style. Stealing home is about the only thing St. Genevieve hasn't accomplished  on the base paths, but Kane says he is working on that.  </P> <P> "The opportunity just hasn't presented itself yet," he said. "But when it does,  we'll probably try it."  </P> <P> No field, no pitch: Chaminade, which began the week 0-5, could be the most  disappointing team in the Valley. Coach Steve Costley says that there is no  mystery to the Eagles' woes.  </P> <P> "I can sum it up in two words," he said. "Errors and walks."  </P> <P> Chaminade has committed 23 errors and the Eagle pitching staff has walked 37  batters.  </P> <P> "We've been terrible," Costley said. "And I don't understand why. We're fine in  practice, but then we go to pieces in the games.  </P> <P> "I can't hit too many more ground balls in practice. I've got blisters all over  my hands as it is."  </P> <P> Add Chaminade: The Eagles' poor fielding has hurt left-handed pitcher Chris  DeCristo as much as anyone. DeCristo, a senior, has an 0-3 record despite a  2.92 earned-run-average. In 12 innings, he has allowed 20 runs, five of them  earned.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BASEBALL TOP 10  </P> <P> Selected by sportswriters of The Times  </P> <TABLE CWL="1.34IN:1.56IN:2.44IN:2.44IN:1.78IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="5"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Last  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Rk  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Wk  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Team  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> League  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Record  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> San Fernando  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> North Valley  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 4-0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Hart  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Foothill  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 5-1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Simi Valley  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Marmonte  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 5-1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Notre Dame  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> S.F.

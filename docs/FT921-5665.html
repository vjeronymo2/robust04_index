			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / International Bonds: Demand firm for NTT's Dollars 250m five-year offering NIPPON Telegraph and Telephone yesterday launched a Dollars 250m five-year bond issue in the international bond market, the first of a Dollars 1bn Eurodollar borrowing spree planned by Japanese utility companies this month. The deal, lead managed by JP Morgan Securities, was launched into a volatile market, with the Eurodollar market shadowing a  1/2 - point collapse in US Treasury bonds at the five-year maturity. The five-year US benchmark bond stood at a yield of 6.67 per cent by the London close, from 6.57 per cent in early afternoon. This volatility did not hamper placement of NTT bonds. Most underwriters said that their allocations of bonds were placed with investors by the time the US markets opened. The 6 7/8 per cent NTT bonds were priced to yield 32 basis points more than US Treasury bonds, considered good value by investors and most participants in the deal. Having been reoffered to investors at a fixed price of 99.50, the bonds traded up to 99.62 bid before the collapse in US Treasury bond prices dragged the issue lower. The lead manager reported firm demand from continental European and UK investors hoping for an appreciation in the US dollar on the foreign exchange markets. At the close the deal stood at 99.18 bid, for a yield spread of 28 basis points over Treasuries. The proceeds of the deal were swapped into yen, but syndicate officials commented that interest rate and currency swaps opportunities had evaporated at the end of last week. Combined with the volatility of dollar bond prices, this may delay the launch of other planned bond issues by Japanese utilities, including Chuba Electric, Kansai Electric and Tokyo Electric Power. Elsewhere, the African Development Bank, the triple-A rated supranational lending agency, is expected to launch a Dollars 300m issue this week, possibly today. The 10-year deal, lead managed by Swiss Bank Corporation, will be the agency's first fixed-rate Eurodollar bond offering. Syndicate officials were yesterday anticipating that the deal would be priced to yield around 35 to 40 basis points more than US Treasury bonds. At this level the bonds would offer a higher yield than paper issued by other better known supra-national agencies.</p>

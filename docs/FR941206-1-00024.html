			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> Effect on Small Entities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The Administrator has determined that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601). It is likely that producers with smaller lot sizes would have higher compliance costs per pound of product because some costs such as testing and recordkeeping occur on a lot basis. Any relabeling costs also would be lower per pound for products with large annual production. No data is available which gives the establishment size breakdown for establishments producing products containing MS(K).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> Paperwork Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> This proposed rule would require establishments to maintain records of bone solids content and bone particle size as a measure of process control, and to make such records available to any duly authorized representative of the Secretary. This proposed rule would also require labels of poultry products produced by mechanical separation (i.e., products currently termed mechanically deboned poultry or MDP) or products containing this ingredient to be revised to include in the ingredients statements the regulated term ``Mechanically Separated (Kind)'' and be submitted to FSIS for approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The paperwork requirements contained in this proposed rule have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons are invited to submit written comments concerning this notice.

			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / International Bonds: French issuer braves unsettled conditions with Ecu deal Only a handful of deals emerged yesterday, as bond market conditions remain unsettled. Dealers said supply of new issues would remain thin until markets showed strong signs of consolidation at these levels. Credit Local de France, the French local government agency, launched the first Ecu bond offering for over a month, via Credit Lyonnais. The Ecu150m seven-year deal is priced to yield 8 basis points more than a comparable issue by the European Community, according to the lead manager. Other dealers, however, said the issue looked rather expensive compared with seven-year paper launched earlier this year. There has been a slight pick-up of interest in Ecu bonds in the last week or so, causing real 10-year Ecu yields to tighten to 10 basis points below the theoretical Ecu yield, according to traders. Having started the year at 25 basis points below, Ecu bonds then suffered a bout of weakness which left them trading flat to the theoretical yield. Although the market is receiving some support from the large amount of Ecu bonds maturing, dealers said many investors, especially institutions, were not reinvesting in Ecu bonds. However, some retail investors are buying more Ecu bonds - with Ecu1bn maturing in April, this could spark further new issues. In the lira sector, Deutsche Bank Finance launched a L500bn 10-year issue of zero-coupon bonds, priced at 42.15 to yield 9.02. Lead manager Deutsche Bank London said the yield was substantially higher than for most outstanding zero-coupon deals, which are trading at about 8.40 per cent. The deal was quoted at 42.15 bid, the same level as the re-offer price. Standard &amp; Poor's has confirmed the AA - long-term credit rating of Bank of Nova Scotia, which had been placed on CreditWatch with negative implications in December. Japan Credit Rating Agency said it would assign a bbb rating to samurai bonds issued by the Republic of Turkey. The rating will affect a total Y485bn. The bonds were issued between June 24 1992, and March 1 1994. JCR is also placing the Government of Turkey under credit monitor. Turkey's economic performance has deteriorated rapidly since the devaluation of the Turkish lira.</p>

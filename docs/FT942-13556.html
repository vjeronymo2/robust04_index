			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Nato tries to play down Serbia row: Dispute with UN a 'communications mismatch' The military command of Nato was scrambling yesterday to play down a row with the United Nations over air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs which has threatened to damage the credibility of both international organisations. Nato officials attributed the dispute to a 'communications mismatch' and similarly reassuring statements were issued by the office of Mr Yasushi Akashi, the special representative in former Yugoslavia of the UN Secretary-General, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali. However, neither side could conceal the fact that a heated telephone conversation took place on Saturday between Mr Akashi and Mr Manfred Worner, the Nato Secretary-General, who was vainly seeking UN permission to begin air attacks. Nato's initial request for permission to launch a bombing mission was issued by Admiral Leighton Smith, the commander of alliance forces in southern Europe. Mr Worner intervened after the request was turned down. Nato command, whose role in Bosnia is technically at the 'invitation' of Mr Boutros Ghali, has made no secret of its determination to secure greater freedom of action in mounting air attacks. Yet the wording of the UN resolutions on Bosnia, and the sensitivity of nations like Britain, France and Canada who have ground troops in Bosnia, have prevented Nato from being given unfettered control. On Friday, Nato issued three separate warnings to the Bosnian Serbs. They were told to expect bombing raids if they failed to: cease fire immediately withdraw from a 3km exclusion zone, and allow UN peacekeepers into Gorazde, by Saturday night withdraw from a 20km zone by Tuesday night. Admiral Smith called for air strikes on Saturday morning because the Serbs had failed to comply with the first condition. Mr Akashi retorted that they were in the process of fulfilling the second condition and should be allowed to do so. Personal relations between Mr Worner and Mr Boutros Ghali were already understood to be poor, and the latest row will strain them further. It is believed that Mr Worner resented the idea of Nato being cast in the role of merely carrying the instructions from UN headquarters in New York. The row showed up the difficulties of using such a blunt instrument as air strikes in such a complex situation. These difficulties might well be more evident to UN commanders on the ground than to alliance commanders outside the country. The first condition was especially difficult to enforce, given that it amounted to a virtual invitation to Gorazde's Moslem defenders to keep the fighting going. The UN's prime concerns include the safety of its own personnel, both humanitarian and military. The Serbs responded to the limited air strikes of two weeks ago by taking over 100 UN staff hostage, and would retaliate even harder to the massive air attacks now threatened by Nato. Russia has argued that air strikes would simply play into the hands of the 'war party' led by General Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb commander and mastermind of the siege of Gorazde.</p>

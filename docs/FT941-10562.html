			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Tebbit attacks 'illegal' EU domestic subsidies Lord Tebbit last night coupled a blistering attack on law breaking and corruption by Britain's European Union partners with a coded appeal to Tory leaders to model the party's Euro-election manifesto on the principles in Lady Thatcher's Bruges speech of 1988. Speaking less than a week after another controversial attack on foreign corruption by Mr Michael Portillo, the rightwing chief Treasury secretary, the former Conservative party chairman hit out at 'illegal' state subsidies provided by various EU countries for domestic industries. Branding Rome 'the agricultural fraud capital of Europe', he described the scale of criminal fraud linked to the Common Agricultural Policy as 'gargantuan'. He urged the government to refuse to allow any decision to be taken at the 1996 inter-governmental conference unless the CAP was reformed. 'How can politicians have spent so much time and energy railing at the tax on domestic heating whilst simply ignoring the vastly greater, far more regressive food tax . . . of some Pounds 1,400 per family per year?' he asked. In a typically robust address to the anti-federalist Bruges Group, Lord Tebbit mocked a 'defeatist, compromising streak' in the Conservative party 'which would disagree with most of what Margaret Thatcher (then prime minister) said at Bruges'. But he saved some of his harshest words for the Liberal Democrats, who are widely expected to pose a severe threat to the Tories in a number of Euro-constituencies, particularly in southern England. The Liberal Democrats were 'to a person, not merely compromisers but full-hearted articulators of the doctrine that Britain is incapable of self-government', he said. This view was shared by the Labour leadership, 'but not by its grass-roots supporters'. The former party chairman's advice to his 'friends in government' for the European elections in June was accordingly to 'stand - and robustly at that  -on policies which would be supported across the country, across all classes and creeds, through all age groups and right across party lines'.</p>

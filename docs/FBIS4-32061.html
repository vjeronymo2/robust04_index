			<p>BFN     [Text] There has been no let-up in chetnik attacks on the  battlefields in the Third Corps' operational zone. They  launched fierce attacks yesterday, especially on the Mount Ozren  and Vozuca battlefields, using all types of heavy artillery.  Here is a report from the Third Corps press center:    [Unidentified correspondent] Dozens of shells hit  Hajdarevici, (Brasnevine), Livade, and Kamenica, and hundreds of  large caliber shells were fired on the defense lines along the  entire front line. The Third Corps responded to these attacks,  so the fighting around Vozuca raged all day yesterday. In  addition to frenzied artillery attacks, the chetniks launched  several unsuccessful infantry attacks in which they suffered the  largest losses so far. We estimate that several dozen of the  aggressor's dead soldiers remained in the no-man's-land between  the front lines. Many of their wounded were abandoned during the  disorderly retreat. The huge losses incurred by the chetniks  during their attempts to capture strategic locations around  Zavidovici, the aim of their offensive, are the reason for the  daily calls for reinforcements.    In addition to the attacks on the Vozuca front, chetniks  were  also active on the Celic battlefield, where they stepped up  provocations and occasionally opened fire from 82-mm mortars.  The situation was similar in the Tesanj area, the free  territories around Teslic, and Doboj, where the aggressor used  infantry weapons and a (?D-1) tank to shell Kalosevici.</p>

			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> B.B. SIGMUND; PRINCETON, N.J., MAYOR  </P> <P> Barbara Boggs Sigmund, the colorful and eloquent mayor who finished second to  Gov. Jim Florio in the 1989 Democratic gubernatorial primary, died early  Wednesday, borough officials said. She was 51.  </P> <P> Mrs. Sigmund, who died at home, had been suffering from a recurrence of cancer.  </P> <P> She was the daughter of retiring U.S. Rep. Lindy Boggs, a New Orleans Democrat,  and the late Hale Boggs, who was the House majority leader and was scheduled to  become Speaker of the House when he was killed in a plane crash in 1972. Mrs.  Boggs reportedly decided to retire from the House to spend more time with her  daughter.  </P> <P> Mrs. Sigmund was first stricken with cancer seven years ago. A malignant  melanoma was found behind her left eye and the eye was removed in 1982. She was  elected Princeton's first woman mayor in 1983.  </P> <P> After losing her eye, Mrs. Sigmund made her large collection of fashionable eye  patches her trademark, coordinating them with the color of her outfits.  </P> <P> As a campaign gimmick during the primary, she distributed eye patches to  businessmen, lobbyists and politicians boarding a Chamber of Commerce chartered  train to Washington.  </P> <P> She was a former Mercer County freeholder and was an unsuccessful candidate for  the U.S. Senate in 1982.  </P></p>

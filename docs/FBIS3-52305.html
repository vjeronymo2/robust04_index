			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yoel Zinger, Foreign Ministry legal adviser, </F> by Ruba al-Husari in Jerusalem--date not given]    [Excerpts] [Al-Husari] There have been conflicting Israeli  and Palestinian assessments of what has been agreed on in Cairo.  Why?    [Zinger] We approved a document in Cairo last Tuesday. It  was close to an agreement. Now, we are trying to obtain the  Palestinian and Israeli leaders' approval of that document.  Despite certain statements, we have received signals that the  Palestinian reply would not be "Yes" or "No," but "Yes, but."  The Egyptian side is exerting great efforts with President  Yasir 'Arafat. Egyptian President Husni Mubarak, his adviser  Usamah al-Baz, and Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa told us in the  presence of the Palestinian delegation that they would try to  make the agreement possible. The main idea was that if  'Arafat's reservations on the document were rather positive,  'Amr Musa would visit Israel to try to persuade us to accept the  Palestinians's reservations. We have presented our concept to  the Palestinians in 108 pages under the headline: "The Israeli  Proposal: Agreement on Gaza Strip and Jericho Area," dated 22  December 1993, and the Palestinians presented their concept in a  similar file. We are now trying to come out with a unified,  acceptable concept.    [Al-Husari] When will the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho  agreement be signed?    [Zinger] We are now discussing four subjects defined by  Yitzhaq Rabin and Yasir 'Arafat to be solved before other  subjects. They are:    1. Foreign security along borders with Egypt and Jordan.    2. Crossing arrangements on border points.    3. The size of the Jericho area.    4. Other issues pertaining to the size of settlements in  the Gaza Strip. [passage omitted]    [Al-Husari] Yitzhaq Rabin said that he was not sure about  Israeli withdrawal by 13 April. Is that surprising?    [Zinger] He is right. The Declaration of Principles  stipulates that the implementation will begin immediately after  signing the Gaza-Jericho agreement, and that we will still have  four months to go, starting from the date of the signing in  order to complete the withdrawal. If we do not end the  negotiations within four months, the withdrawal will be  postponed. If we do not sign, no withdrawal will take place.  However, I believe we can reach an agreement and sign it by  mid-April.    [Al-Husari] It is clear to everybody that Yasir 'Arafat  needs  a quick agreement. Is Israel in a hurry too to reach such an  agreement?    [Zinger] I do not know if we are in a hurry. We have made  commitments and we want to comply with them as soon as possible.  We must expect a delay of a few weeks or months, but this  situation must not drag out further since the agreement risks  meeting the same fate as that of Camp David. We wanted to  negotiate with the PLO because it was facing problems and was  about to disappear. We realized that it was in nobody's  interest for it to disappear and for Israel to remain alone  facing several organizations, none of which is able to speak in  the name of all the Palestinian people and to impose itself on  them. Therefore, a further delay in implementation of the  agreement could lead not only to the PLO's disappearance, but  also to its collapse. This is in nobody's interest. [passage  omitted]    [Al-Husari] You were quoted as saying at the meeting of the  Knesset Foreign Affairs and Security Committee that the military  rule will remain the source of power in the self-rule areas.  What does this mean?    [Zinger] In the Declaration of Principles we agreed to  dissolve the civil administration and end the military rule, but  without dissolving it. The powers that will not be transferred  to the Palestinians will remain in the hands of the military  rule. The headquarters of the military rule will be located  anywhere outside the self-rule area in Gaza. The work of the  military rule will focus on the affairs of the settlements and  the Israelis.    [Al-Husari] Will the military rule continue to issue  military  orders as the case has been since 1967?    [Zinger] I do not know. The military rule might issue orders  related to settlements, such as preventing the Israelis from  entering Gaza. And the only way to do this is through military  rule. The military rule might also issue orders related to  external security. The important thing is that, theoretically,  we are not talking about independence. Therefore, we will not  abolish the military rule and will not completely end Israeli  control.    [Al-Husari] Will you maintain military rule because you  think  there will be a need to return to the occupied territory one day?    [Zinger] If I can read the Israeli Government's mind well, I  think Israel does not want to return to Gaza at all. On the  contrary, it might fear that one day this will be its only  choice if the Palestinian police force fails to carry out its  duties. We might be forced to do something we hate to do. We  want to leave the Gaza Strip and never go back to it. Another  situation might emerge if a large-scale war breaks out in the  region.    [Al-Husari] Does this apply to the West Bank?    [Zinger] The situation in the West Bank is very complicated.  For this reason, we are only talking about Gaza first. There  are many differences between Gaza and the West Bank. In the  West Bank, we are facing on the eastern front countries, who are  still in a state of war with Israel. This situation does not  exist in Gaza, because in Gaza there is only Egypt. In Gaza,  there are 4,000 Israelis, while in the West Bank there are  100,000 Israelis. We find a solution to the four settlement  areas by linking them through one road to Israel. Therefore,  the Israelis will use four roads in Gaza only. This, however,  will be impossible to apply in the West Bank.    [Al-Husari] Will the final status of the West Bank be  different from that of the Gaza Strip?    [Zinger] The answer might be yes and no. In Gaza, there is  no water problem, while in the West Bank there is only one water  reserve. And in Gaza there are no holy places while in the West  Bank there are many holy places some of which are common [to  Muslims, Christians, and Jews]. The West Bank is different from  Gaza in everything. Therefore, we decided to concentrate on  Gaza now and not to think at all, in the current stage, of what  is taking place in the West Bank.    [Al-Husari] Have you noticed any difference in the talks  with  the Palestinians when the negotiators are changed, such as the  absence or presence of Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas]?    [Zinger] I believe that the Declaration of Principles could  not have been reached in Oslo without Abu-Mazin and Abu-'Ala'  [Ahmad Quray']. They were the catalysts within the PLO, and  they are the ones who understand the spirit of the Declaration  of Principles. When we began talks on the implementation of the  Declaration of Principles, neither attended these talks and we  found ourselves in front of new people. The problem here is  that those new negotiators have to begin from square one and  that they sometimes think they can use their skills to improve  the Oslo accord. However, since they were not in the operation  room when the accord was concluded they do not know its real  components because it was ready before them.</p>

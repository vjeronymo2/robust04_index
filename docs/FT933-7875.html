			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / World Trade News: E Germany sees former Comecon trade fall GERMANY'S trade with eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union has undergone an extraordinary upheaval in the past four years, with a complete switch from east to west Germany as the main source of exports and market for imports. A new report compiled by the Institute for the German Economy (IW) in Cologne shows how the external trade ties of east Germany collapsed after the Comecon trade bloc was effectively wound up in 1990/91, and how west German industry moved in to fill the gap. Between 1989 and 1992, east German exports to eastern and central Europe fell overall by more than 75 per cent, from almost DM29bn (Pounds 11.5bn) to just DM7bn. In the same period, west Germany pushed up its sales from DM24.4bn to DM30.1bn, an increase of some 23 per cent. East Germany's ailing enterprises were hit not only by the switch into hard currency pricing, but also by a clear preference in eastern Europe for west German products, according to the IW report. The east Germans also proved unable to switch from state-trading relations to competitive export marketing. More than 51 per cent of west Germany's exports to eastern Europe consists of investment goods and equipment, including machinery, vehicles and electrical products. However, western exports, and imports, have been boosted by the trend towards the processing of German products under contract in the cheaper wage economies of eastern Europe. Eastern Germany, on the other hand, retained much more traditional emphasis on raw materials and agricultural products in its exports. Overall, Germany's exports to eastern and central Europe still fell - by some 30 per cent - between 1989 and 1992, while its combined imports fell by nearly 23 per cent. Trade with the two parts of the former Czechoslovakia has grown dramatically with west Germany. German exports were up 172.5 per cent, and imports up nearly 166 per cent. East German exports to the former Czechoslovakia fell less than to other parts of eastern Europe, down a mere 79 per cent in the period.</p>

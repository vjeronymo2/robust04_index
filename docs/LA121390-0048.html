			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL APPROVES WATER PROGRAM  </P> <P> The San Diego City Council has approved a $13.7-million water conservation  program that it is estimated will save the city more than 300,000 gallons of  water a day for five years.  </P> <P> The program will distribute water-saving plumbing device kits, provide better  response to water-waste complaints, and establish information, education,  rebate and auditing programs, an official said.  </P> <P> It is estimated that the program will save enough water each year to supply  16,000 households.  </P> <P> "This one is a comprehensive, integrated, long-term voluntary water  conservation program," said Marsi Steirer, a water conservation analyst for the  city. Steirer said the program is unusual because, by collecting data from and  following up on families that install the water-saving devices, the city will  learn how San Diegans use water.  </P> <P> But the water savings estimated in the plan were based on 80% of the households  using the water-saving devices, Steirer said. "I really think that San Diegans  are willing and ready to adopt the water conservation program that the council  adopted."  </P> <P> The program was passed on a 6-2 vote Monday, with Mayor Maureen O'Connor and  Councilman Bruce Henderson dissenting.  </P></p>

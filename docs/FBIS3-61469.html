These microwaveguides are based on scalar  isotropic approximation. A numerical algorithm for calculating  the transfer characteristics of devices with a waveguide  transmission line is developed. In order to reduce the influence  of solid waves, a uniform directional coupler is proposed for  use. The amplitude- frequency characteristics of a filter  containing two aperture apodized interdigital transducers joined  by a directional coupler are measured and the results given. The  topology of the devices is also analyzed. It is shown that the  mathematical model which is used for the waveguide is adequate  for the results of the experimental research. Moreover, the  technical characteristics of the devices exceed traditional  analogs. Figures 5; references 7.</p>

			<p><P> February 27, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK: 'QUAYLE TRAIL' WAS BUMPY ROAD FOR PRESIDENTIAL ADVISERS  </P> <P> A year or so ago, when top presidential advisers Ken Khachigian and Stu Spencer  met at Tommy's Family Restaurant in San Clemente to jaw about politics, they  came to this conclusion: It might be a kick to campaign with a vice  presidential candidate.  </P> <P> "I said, 'You know, actually, Stu, it might be more fun if we traveled with the  vice presidential candidate. More independence. You get to be on the attack all  the time because that's the function you fulfill,' " Khachigian recalled while  speaking the other day to the Republican Associates of Orange County.  </P> <P> But neither Spencer nor Khachigian -- who ended up traveling with Dan Quayle --  figured that the campaign would be quite so bumpy.  </P> <P> "I used to be 6-foot-3 and have black hair," the several inches shorter and  much more gray Khachigian joked of what he called the "Quayle trail."  </P> <P> Khachigian, a former speech writer for President Reagan and a close adviser to  Gov. George Deukmejian, and Spencer, whose counsel has been sought by top  Republicans from Nixon to Reagan, were Quayle's "handlers" during the  tumultuous fall campaign.  </P> <P> Khachigian, 44, of San Clemente gave a wry account of the campaign that  succeeded in spite of itself. He said he first met Quayle about a week after  the Republican convention in New Orleans when Bush literally plucked the  youthful Indiana senator out of a crowd on the river front and, in a stunning  announcement, said he had selected Quayle for the other half of the GOP ticket.  </P> <P> "Basically all he did was show up," Khachigian said. "No one told him what to  say or suggested to him how to comport himself. . . . So while I think it was a  clever, creative idea that might have worked with somebody who had been  experienced in national politics at that level, it was sort of uncomfortable  situation."  </P> <P> Quayle's speech, instead of establishing him as a credible national candidate,  was better suited to a county central committee meeting.  </P> <P> But things quickly got worse in the next few days as questions were raised  about Quayle's military service record in the National Guard, his grade-point  average in college and the method used to get him admitted to law school.  </P> <P> "He started out behind the eight-ball," Khachigian said. On the campaign trail,  Quayle continued to fuel the controversy over his credentials by making  mistakes.  </P> <P> "At one press conference, very early in campaign, seems to me in Montana, he  was asked out of the blue what his feelings were about the Holocaust,"  Khachigian said. "It was the last question he expected. And he said, 'Well,  that was a tragic period in American history.' Of course, everybody knows --  they knew, we knew -- that he meant world history. Then there was a follow-up  question to that, and he said, 'As you know, I wasn't born in this century.'  "It's one of these things, how can you take back words that you say?"  Khachigian asked. "There are people for whom the words sort of come out faster  than they intend."  </P> <P> As a national candidate, Quayle's offhand remarks stuck with him.  </P> <P> "It's repeated over and over again, and Newsweek puts it in that little quote  compilation every week . . . and then the other side starts using it and pretty  soon they've got this list of quotes," Khachigian said. "Well, we do it to the  other side. And they did it to us."  </P> <P> There were other snafus, some of which Khachigian blamed on the campaign staff.  On one occasion, Quayle was due to make a major speech on foreign policy and  national security. A speech was written by Khachigian with input from Quayle.  But Quayle wanted to, as Khachigian said, "wing it."  </P> <P> The trouble was the text of the speech already had been distributed to the  national press corps. When Quayle started speaking off the cuff, reporters were  thrown. They started frantically taking notes and rushed to phones to cancel  earlier stories they had filed, awaiting what they supposed would be only minor  changes.  </P> <P> "So they were outraged," Khachigian said. "That was really a sad mistake. And  we really disserved the candidate that day."  </P> <P> As a result, Khachigian said, the speech, "which I thought was not a bad  speech" was generally described as pretty awful.  </P> <P> But the Bush-Quayle ticket won, after all. Khachigian said there were even many  good moments on the Quayle trail and a few laughs. "So we did have some fun,"  Khachigian said. But, he added, "We didn't make much national attention unless  there was a problem."  </P></p>

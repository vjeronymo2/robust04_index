			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Pavel Lomakin report from the "Situation in Ukraine" </F> column: "If Meshkov Did Not Exist, Kravchuk Would Have Invented  Him"]    [Text] Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov has made a move  that is rather surprising in the runup to the elections in  Ukraine, which are so critical for him too. A very long move,  at that: to Geneva, at the invitation and at the expense of the  international nongovernmental organization Forum, thus giving  rise to numerous rumors among his countrymen.    Supporters regard Meshkov's trip as a visit by a political  leader recognized in the West, while gossip-hungry cynics see it  as a trip to open a Swiss bank account. Be that as it may,  Meshkov left with an easy mind: According to surveys, even  though the Crimeans will go to the polls, in the majority of  cases they will not vote for Leonid Kravchuk but for Leonid  Kuchma. Generally, it is foolish to deny that Meshkov is an  extraordinary figure on the CIS political stage. Public calm on  the peninsula -- as well as relations between Simferopol and  Kiev -- largely depends on him. The Crimean president's trip to  Moscow and the inviting of metropolitan economists to Crimea are  seen as his most successful moves. Yevgeniy Saburov assumed  office virtually painlessly, which is more than can be said for  his Moscow team. The Crimean Supreme Soviet in particular has  started to drop broad hints that the president, by betting on  the Muscovites, has fallen hostage to cabinet politics not  formulated in Crimea, and it has begun to challenge Meshkov's  edict-issuing powers.    True, the slogan "face to face with Russia" has not lost its  attraction to the Crimeans. It is also significant that  Kravchuk, who planned to visit the mutinous peninsula in the  course of his election campaign, has not so far made up his  mind. The friction between Simferopol and Kiev has brought  dividends not only to Meshkov. Occasionally, he has acted too  sharply, which in the absence of open support from Moscow only  heightened passions in Kiev over Ukraine's territorial integrity  and brought considerable political dividends to Kravchuk,  custodian of the Constitution, both in the West and at home.    If preelection polls reflect the situation adequately and  the  majority of Crimeans and other Ukrainian voters vote for Kuchma,  even then Meshkov's problems will not diminish. Because so far,  political demarches come off better with him than economic  solutions. Kuchma for his part -- even though, judging by his  election statements, he advocates a union with Russia, on the  one hand, and Crimea's sovereignty within Ukraine's borders on  the other -- will hardly put up with sluggish reform.  Furthermore, in this event Meshkov will most likely also have  to revise some of the decisions made. For example, it is not  clear how a constitution revived by the Supreme Soviet,  restoring the independent Crimean Republic, will fit into the  concept of state structure a la Kuchma.    Possibly, it was the uncertainty of the situation that  forced  Meshkov to leave his country at such a crucial moment. A month  ago, during the Crimean president's trip to Cyprus, Kravchuk  sanctioned an unexpected landing in Simferopol of top military  brass and special task forces. This enabled Meshkov once more  to show himself off as an independent leader. It is unlikely  that anything like this will happen now (discounting Kravchuk's  possible visit) but it is not ruled out that Kiev is provoking  Meshkov to undertake another demarche.</p>

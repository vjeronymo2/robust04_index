			<p>BFN     [Text] The Abkhazian Supreme Soviet Chairman, Vladislav  Ardzinba, told Interfax today that the current non-official  consultations between representatives of Sukhumi and Tbilisi did  not mean the renewal of Georgian-Abkhazian negotiations.  Ardzinba said this would require cancellation of the Georgian  parliament's resolution on the dismissal of the Abkhazian  parliament which had in fact broken the negotiations.    Ardzinba also expressed his regret due to continuing  economic  sanctions against Abkhazia which had been imposed by Russia.  "The Abkhazian population has suffered from the burden of the  war and is now restoring the republic. However, it has been  deprived of the most necessary things. Primarily, this concerns  the mainly urban Russian-speaking population," Ardzinba stressed.    Ardzinba pointed out that Abkhazian society was indignant  about the Russian sanctions. "Instead of friendly assistance  they are trying to starve us," Ardzinba said. He suggested this  was the policy of a certain Russian department which often spoke  in defense of Russian-speaking populations living abroad.  However, this did not seem to be being put into practice.    Ardzinba stressed that rail transport through Abkhazian  territory could be renewed in spite of all difficulties. "We  guarantee the security for the movement of both people and  goods," he pointed out.    Commenting on the situation in the Kodor Canyon and on the  Abkhazian-Georgian border formed by the Inguri River, Ardzinba  said it was in general stable. The Georgian military formations  which had occupied the village of Lata since autumn 1993 had  been forced to retreat to the mountains.    "Abkhazian armed forces control the situation on the Inguri  River," Ardzinba emphasized.    The Abkhazian Press and Information Ministry told Interfax  that the situation in the Kodor Canyon villages was normalizing.    The UN mission of military observers in Abkhazia visited the  villages of Lower Lata and Upper Lata on March 31 from where  Georgian troops have been forced. The head of the UN mission  said in an interview with Interfax that he would inform the UN  Security Council on the last events in the Kodor Canyon.</p>

			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / BAe poised for deal with Saudis BRITISH AEROSPACE expects a contract within weeks to supply additional Tornado bombers to Saudi Arabia, following a Pounds 1.5bn cash injection into the Saudi programme for purchasing arms and defence services from the UK. Mr John Major, UK prime minister, said at the weekend Saudi Arabia's King Fahd had decided to make the extra funding available. 'This is the event that we've been waiting for,' said a spokesman for BAe, prime contractor for UK supplies under the Al-Yamamah arms agreement between the two countries. The money is expected to facilitate the signing of contracts worth several billion pounds under the second phase of the agreement. The framework for this second phase was agreed almost four years ago. But, except for three Vosper Thornycroft minehunting vessels, no significant new equipment orders have been placed since then. Other planned supplies include 48 Tornado jets, about 60 BAe Hawk light fighters, 88 Black Hawk armed helicopters from Westland under licence from Sikorsky of the US, three minehunters, and infrastructure projects including an air base on the edge of Saudi Arabia's Empty Quarter. Saudi Arabia earmarks 500,000 barrels of oil a day for its UK defence supplies. This is sold by oil companies and the revenue paid into a Saudi account in London, from which the British Ministry of Defence draws down money to pay BAe. Although this brings in about Pounds 2bn a year, the funds have been taken up by the completion of first-phase deliveries, training and support services and construction work on air bases. Mr Major said discussions were going on 'regarding all kinds of weapon systems' required by Saudi Arabia. Al-Yamamah supplies had topped Pounds 10bn so far. Saudi Arabia injected almost Pounds 2bn extra cash into the deal in late 1989, when it also raised by 25 per cent the amount of oil set aside for this purpose. The additional Tornados, made in collaboration with Germany and Italy, are believed to be at the top of the Saudi 'wish list'. A new contract would provide crucial interim work for BAe's Warton factory in Lancashire, where final assembly of Tornados for the RAF ends this summer. Production of the European Fighter Aircraft is unlikely before 1994.</p>

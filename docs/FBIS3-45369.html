			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yu Cheng (6735 2052): "Sino-U.S. Trade Must </F> Adhere to the Principle of Mutual Benefit"]    [Text] Hong Kong, 18 Jan (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--After  going through several rounds of arduous talks, China and the  United States finally reached a new agreement on textile goods.  This agreement has undoubtedly given both China and the United  States -- and even Hong Kong's industrial and commercial circles  -- a breathing spell and has also raised the hope that China's  MFN trading status will be renewed for another year. Yet, the  more important message conveyed by the agreement is that  economic and trade exchanges should be carried out on the basis  of the principle of mutual benefit; otherwise, both parties will  suffer losses.    Over the past year and more, the United States has added a  great number of non-economic factors to economic and trade  dealings with China, thus creating many obstacles for industrial  and commercial ties between the two countries. During its talks  with China on a new textile agreement, the United States filed  groundless charges against China's U.S.-bound textile exports  and unilaterally imposed sanctions against China. As a result,  the two sides were unable to reach a consensus before the  deadline of the old agreement and have had to speed up the pace  of their negotiations in order to enter a new one. It is beyond  any doubt that the new agreement has served to eliminate one of  the unclear factors currently exiting in Sino- U.S. trade, yet  people are still closely following the issue of the United  States' renewal of China's MFN trading status.    No matter whether it is under the newly reached Sino-U.S.  textile agreement or when engaged in other bilateral economic  and trade relations, China has always acted in accordance with  the principle of mutual benefit. Over the past several years,  in light of its own realistic conditions, China has done a great  deal of work in opening the domestic market, reducing tariffs,  protecting intellectual property rights, and even improving the  human rights record. Yet, due to differences in social,  historical, cultural, and economic backgrounds and conditions,  it is obvious that foreign countries should not force their own  standards on China or demand that China make impractical changes.    If the United States can renew or even change its improper  practice of making an annual appraisal on China's MFN trading  status, I believe that both countries will be able to enjoy  considerable social and economic benefits. The reasonable  prices and constantly improving quality of China's exported  products favor to American consumers at the middle and lower  social strata. On the other hand, American manufacturers and  businessmen can also benefit from the normalization of Sino-U.S.  economic and trade relations. A great number of American  businessmen and even transnational enterprises have already set  up factories and representative offices in China in an attempt  to open up this huge market which has great potential.    China's demand for imports has grown rapidly over that of  recent years. According to statistics released by the Chinese  customs authority, the value of China's imports of all kinds of  materials in 1993 totalled $103.9 billion, representing a  29-percent increase over that of 1992. During the same period,  however, export growth stood at only 9 percent; as a result,  China's trade deficits have gone as high as $12.18 billion.    China's persistence in upholding the policy of reform and  opening up and in speeding up the pace of economic development  needs to be backed by investment in various types of capital and  basic construction projects. Therefore, it can be predicted  that China needs to import $700 billion worth of relevant  materials in stages over the coming several years. This  undoubtedly holds great appeal for foreign investors. China  will nevertheless continue to carry out economic and trade  exchanges with foreign countries in accordance with the  time-tested principle and policies of mutual benefit and hopes  that all its economic and trade partners can also show respect  for this spirit. China apparently wishes to bring a continued  favorable turn to its economic and trade relations with the  United States, including to renewal of its MFN trading status.  However, such a relationship needs to be a long-lasting one, not  simply one that is extended annually.</p>

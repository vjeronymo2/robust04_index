			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Hopes of savings may be over-optimistic - The Battle For Midland THE HOPES of Lloyds and Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation of making big immediate cost savings if either of them buys Midland Bank may be over-optimistic. That is the implication of a detailed study of European bank mergers by Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank, and Mr Steven Davis, the banking consultant and founder of Davis International. Mr Davis argues, on the basis of an investigation of nine mergers involving big European banks, that shareholders in those banks have benefited only modestly from post-merger cost cuts. He says: 'While many European merger partners have largely achieved targeted savings in staff, branch numbers and overall expense levels, we believe that most if not all of those economies could have been obtained without the merger.' The combination of Algemene Bank Nederland and Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank, which was announced in 1990, was in one sense a model for Lloyds' proposed bid. It involved the merger of two of the Netherlands' biggest banks, of roughly equal size, to create by far the largest Dutch bank, now called ABN Amro. Mr Davis highlights two hitches in ABN Amro's attempts to make cost savings. It did not want to make forced redundancies, so was forced to pay more than projected in voluntary severance packages. Lloyds has also said that it hopes not to make forced redundancies in meeting its target of reducing staff numbers at the combined banks by 20,000. Potential redundancy costs are less of a concern to Hongkong Bank than Lloyds, since it has relatively small operations in the UK and therefore would be unlikely to shed staff in great numbers. ABN Amro also encountered problems in linking the computer systems. It is unlikely to unify the administration or back office systems till late 1994. This is relevant to both Hongkong Bank and Lloyds, since both hope to make savings by unifying their computer systems with Midland's. As a result of such redundancy costs and systems problems, Mr Davis is 'not optimistic about the possibility of realising significant net cost savings (at ABN Amro) in the near future'. Mr Davis also argues that mergers tend to work better, in terms of generating additional profits, if the managers of one bank become the dominant force in the combined banks. A failure to eliminate managers is costly in itself. But a multiplication of managers often also leads to delays in the process of making decisions on how to reorganise and reduce overheads. Lloyds Bank has to date not spelled out its proposals for top management. Hongkong Bank is planning to retain most of Midland's senior directors, who would run Midland as an autonomous subsidiary. However, Hongkong Bank's directors would fill the senior positions in the parent company and therefore play the dominant role.</p>

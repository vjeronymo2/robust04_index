			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAGUNA MUSEUM SHOWS 20 FLAGS, BUT WAIVES 21ST;  </P> <P> ART: ORANGE COUNTY'S LARGEST NEA GRANTEE EXCLUDES A CONTROVERSIAL PIECE FROM  MARK HERESY'S 'FLAGS' EXHIBIT.  </P> <P> The Laguna Art Museum, whose director has vowed to "abide by the rules" to  secure a hefty sum of National Endowment for the Arts grants, has excluded a  potentially controversial work from one of its current installations.  </P> <P> The exhibit, "Flags," includes 20 of 21 American flags that political artist  Mark Heresy has fashioned out of such materials as bullets and buckshot shells,  cut currency and human hair. But the 21st flag, "Freedom of the Press," a Stars  and Stripes replica constructed of photos from pornographic magazines, has been  left out.  </P> <P> The Laguna Art Museum is Orange County's largest NEA grantee this year, having  been awarded six grants totaling $222,500. Recipients of 1990 grants have been  required to certify that they will not produce or present work that the NEA  might consider obscene.  </P> <P> Museum director Charles Desmarais on Thursday angrily defended the museum's  omission of the flag and insisted that its exclusion was "absolutely not"  influenced by fear of losing NEA funding.  </P> <P> He said the museum's decision to display all but one of Heresy's flags was "a  matter of selection" and that the excluded work was not specifically singled  out. "I don't care if there were 50 flags," he said. "It's the job of the  museum to make choices. . . . We didn't omit things. We select what we believe  to be valuable and important to include for our public."  </P> <P> Asked whether he considers "Freedom of the Press" to be not valuable or  important, Desmarais replied: "You can draw your own conclusions."  </P> <P> Heresy said his flag works are an attempt to illustrate his view of America's  bent toward censorship, militarism and materialism by infusing artifacts  representative of those attitudes into the fabric of the nation's symbol of  freedom.  </P> <P> The exclusion of the porno-mag flag, he said, underscores the message he hopes  to portray in the piece -- that America pretends to stand for freedom of  expression yet institutionalizes censorship.  </P> <P> "It just reinforces what the piece says," said the 25-year-old L.A. artist.  "It's very much about hypocrisy. It's a very cynical piece."  </P> <P> Heresy said, however, that he doesn't fault the Laguna museum for leaving out  the flag. Instead, he said, he is "encouraged" that the rest of the exhibit was  accepted at all by a museum in a predominantly conservative county.  </P> <P> He credits Bolton T. Colburn, the museum's curator of collections. Colburn  "really stuck his neck out on this," Heresy said. "It gives me hope that we can  still do art and say something without (being censored) too heavily."  </P> <P> Nearly two dozen artists or arts groups, including the Bella Lewitzy Dance  Company in Los Angeles, have rejected NEA funding this year because of the  obscenity stipulation, which they contend is the equivalent of an  anti-obscenity loyalty oath. Museum officials recently sent to the NEA an  acceptance form for a $150,000 grant along with a letter that expressed  objection to the certification but said "we will abide by the rules," Desmarais  said last week.  </P> <P> The "Flags" exhibit is scheduled to remain on display at the museum through  Dec. 16.  </P></p>

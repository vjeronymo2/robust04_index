			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company News: Earnings at Caterpillar surge ahead to Dollars 96m CATERPILLAR, the US heavy equipment and machinery manufacturer, said third-quarter earnings, excluding a Dollars 495m tax windfall, jumped to Dollars 96m, or 95 cents a share, from last year's Dollars 5m, or 5 cents. The improvement follows an 18 per cent increase in sales in the US, and a 6 per cent rise in worldwide sales. Sales for the quarter were Dollars 2.8bn, against Dollars 2.7bn a year ago. The company said sales of agricultural, road construction, and home building equipment in the US strengthened, but sales in Europe declined. Caterpillar expects demand in Europe and Japan to improve during 1994. Higher US industry demand continued to reflect increased replacement buying because of low interest rates, growth in corporate cash flow, and generally improving levels of economic activity. The recovery has lifted Caterpillar's sales in the US to 50 per cent of company sales, from 45 per cent last year. For the nine months net income was Dollars 533m, or Dollars 5.27, on sales of Dollars 8.4bn, compared with a loss of Dollars 216m, or Dollars 2.14, excluding extraordinary charges, on sales of Dollars 7.4bn in the same period last year.</p>

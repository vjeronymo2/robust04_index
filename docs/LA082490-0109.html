			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: STAGE / NANCY CHURNIN: STARLIGHT MAY RESURRECT USO ERA FOR  NEW MUSICAL  </P> <P> Starlight Musical Theatre has been talking about doing a new show for years.  Now it looks as if the company has finally made its choice -- a still untitled  musical about the United Service Organization (USO) in Southern California at  the start of World War II.  </P> <P> Starlight commissioned the musical from Anthony Stimac, founder and artistic  director of Musical Theatre Works in New York, and tested out the show in a  staged reading last Saturday at San Diego City College in the fourth workshop  of its 1990 Prelude series.  </P> <P> The story follows the lives of three women performers who fall in love with  servicemen and follow them to the South Pacific. While new music was written  for it by Peter Ekstrom and lyricist Steve Hays, the story draws heavily from  classic songs, including "Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree," "Over There" and  "You're in the Army Now."  </P> <P> Whether Starlight can get the rights to perform these standards in the show is  one of the questions the company is currently pursuing.  </P> <P> If all goes well, the show may play Starlight Bowl as early as August, 1991,  said James Dark, president of the Board of Trustees. If it is not ready for the  1991 season, Dark said the musical may open the 1992 season.  </P> <P> This move toward commissioning a new play comes at a time when Starlight is  finding it harder to come up with musicals new to San Diego.  </P> <P> There aren't a lot of new musicals out there for Starlight to choose from, Dark  said. Shows like 'Phantom of the Opera,' 'Cats' and 'Starlight Express' may  never be released to regional theaters, and recent hits like "Grand Hotel,"  "City of Angels" and "Meet Me in St. Louis" have been reserved for touring  companies for at least the next few years.  </P> <P> That leaves Starlight looking at shows that have been around the block a few  times, like "Cinderella" and "Man of La Mancha." Also under consideration is  "Babes in Arms," which includes the songs "The Lady is a Tramp" and "My Funny  Valentine" from the film version of "Pal Joey."  </P> <P> Not coincidentally, Starlight's backward look also comes at a time when  Starlight is looking at the box office -- nervously. Starlight relies upon its  box office for 75% of its revenues, and a disappointing turnout for its first  attempt at Sondheim, the critically acclaimed season opener "Follies," made the  board of trustees anxious, according to several sources.  </P> <P> "Our subscription base is going down," said Dark. "Starlight has always been  and will always be a very successful operation. We operate in the black. But  even a slight dip in subscription base hurts you. We will keep our fingers  crossed and hope we break even this year."  </P> <P> But why the drop in subscription base? Are people getting tired of the old  standards or are people turning off at Starlight's recent attempts to try  something new? Are people turning away from the planes that plague the  Starlight Bowl or would the company lose its audience altogether if it dared to  move? -- probably a moot point, since Starlight' lease with the city for the  Bowl runs for another 17 years.  </P> <P> Or is Starlight's audience aging out of the picture? And are the tried-and-true  musicals failing to bring in younger fans and different audiences.  </P> <P> No one knows. In the meantime, Starlight is trying to please the old audience  as well as the audience that wants something new by commissioning new shows,  like the USO show, which will have an old-fashioned feel to them.  </P> <P> Starlight will also continue to look to Musical Theatre Works as an ongoing  source of new material.  </P> <P> "We will basically be their West Coast branch and we will continue the Prelude  series every year," said Dark. "Our Board is committed to it."  </P> <P> The next new musical coming into town will come via Lamb's Players Theatre,  which will present the West Coast premiere of a new Off-Broadway-bound musical  Oct. 5-Nov. 11.  </P> <P> Robert Smyth, the artistic director of the small National City theater troupe,  said he has had his eye on "Johnny Pye and the Foolkiller" for at least four  years, since it originated with an Indiana company called the New Harmony  Project.  </P> <P> Writer Mark St. Germain adapted the book from a story by Stephen Vincent Benet  about a man's 70-year quest to outwit death, also known as "the foolkiller."  The music and lyrics are by Randy Courts. Deborah Gilmour Smyth, Lamb's  associate director will direct.  </P> <P> Smyth learned about the musical from one-time Lamb's Players Theatre ensemble  member David McFadzean, who was instrumental in starting the New Harmony  Project.  </P> <P> Producer Carolyn Copeland produced the show at the George Street Theatre in New  Jersey and is now planning for an Off-Broadway run. Copeland, a longtime friend  of Smyth's, gave Lamb's the opportunity to do the West Coast premiere. Lamb's  will not be involved in the New York run.  </P> <P> PROGRAM NOTES: Rumors are heating up about stars reportedly going to check out  the staged reading of the San Diego Repertory Theatre's new musical, "The Life  and Life of Bumpy Johnson," Sept. 29 and 30 at Newark Symphony Hall in Newark,  New Jersey. Spike Lee and Bill Cosby are said to be interested in Amiri  Baraka's script about real-life black gangster Bumpy Johnson. Johnson became a  hero in his community by using his money to help bankroll the Harlem  Renaissance. George Ferencz is directing and jazz Hall of Famer Max Roach is  writing the music. The show will have its world premiere at the Rep in January.  . . . San Diego Playgoers will present "Les Miserables" and "City of Angels" --  along with "Grand Hotel" -- on its fall season schedule. The dates will be  decided this week, said Stan Seiden, president of the Nederlander organization  which presents the San Diego Playgoer series. . . . The San Diego Repertory  Theatre is hoping to remount its successful production of Lanford Wilson's  "Burn This" beginning Oct. 17 if it can sign the original cast. So far it has  lined up three out of the four actors. . . . Craig Noel, executive producer of  the Old Globe Theatre, celebrates his 75th birthday Saturday, but the big  "Birthday Fantasy" celebration will be mounted as an Old Globe Gala Oct. 13.  Noel, who won an award from the San Diego Critics Circle for his directing just  last year, has invested 53 of those 75 years at the Old Globe. . . . Lamb's  Players Theatre will rent the Lyceum Space Sept. 19-30 to present its artistic  director, Robert Smyth, in the one-man play, "Damien," about the priest who  devoted his life to caring for the lepers in a leper colony. Smyth is actively  looking for a permanent downtown space for his National City company, and will  explore a less conventional downtown venue when the company brings "Dickens,  Dining and Song," a production of "A Christmas Carol" along with a very real  Christmas dinner to St. Paul's Cathedral Dec. 12-23. . . . In the musical  chairs department: Steve Bevans, Starlight's acting general manager, has  resigned to become the new managing director for the Gaslamp Quarter Theatre  Company. Alfred J. Dillon is Starlight's new managing director and Starlight is  launching a nationwide search for an executive director/chairman of the board.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The current regulations contain safeguards designed to enhance the accuracy of conversion appraisals. Under 12 CFR 563b.7(f), the OTS requires that the appraisal be prepared by an appraiser who is independent of the converting association and who has expertise in the area of corporate appraisals. Although the conversion regulations have been amended numerous times since 1974, the requirement that the conversion stock be sold at its  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro forma  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> market value has remained constant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The integrity of the conversion process rests, in large part, on the accuracy of the appraised value of the converting association. It is for this reason that the OTS is concerned about recent conversions that have exhibited significant increases in the immediate post-conversion trading market for the stock. Although some of these increases can be explained by the high levels of speculation that have existed generally in the market for financial institution stocks, the OTS is concerned that many of these appraisal reports may have set  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro forma  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> market values that were significantly below the true value of the converting associations. In such cases, the converting association is harmed because the net proceeds from the conversion, and the association's capital levels, are lower as a result of its stock being undervalued upon issuance. Conversely, insiders and other sophisticated investors are able to accrue undeserved financial benefits. When this occurs, the independence and competence of the appraiser are called into question.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The OTS relies on the independent appraiser to submit an appraisal report that is impartial, objective and arrived at independently, without undue influence from the converting association or any of its other agents, including its attorneys, accountants, underwriters or selling agents. The OTS is taking this opportunity to remind those persons serving as conversion appraisers that the current regulations require that the conversion applicant submit information demonstrating, to the satisfaction of the OTS, the independence and expertise of the appraiser. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In those cases where there appears to be a consistent pattern of undervaluation on the part of an appraiser, it may be difficult for the applicant or the appraiser to establish that the appraiser has acted independently and in a competent manner. In more egregious cases, the OTS also may determine to censure, suspend or bar an appraiser from practicing before the OTS under the OTS rules of practice, 12 CFR part 513.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 12 CFR 563b.7(f)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the current rules, &sect;563b.7(f)(1)(ii) permits the appraisal report to contain a ``brief summary'' of data that is sufficient to support the appraiser's conclusions as to the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro forma  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> market value of the converting association. Section 563b.7(f)(3), however, permits the OTS to request additional information with respect to the pricing of the converting association's capital stock. In practice, the OTS, relying on &sect;563b.7(f)(3), has required that a full appraisal report be submitted as part of the conversion application. In that regard, the OTS and its predecessor, the FHLBB, have provided detailed policy guidance to the industry regarding appropriate appraisal standards to be used in valuing conversion stock. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> FHLBB, Guidelines for Appraisal Reports for the Valuation of Savings and Loan Associations and Savings Banks Converting From Mutual to Stock Form of Organization (October 1983); FHLBB, Guidelines for the Valuation of Savings and Loans Converting from Mutual to Stock Form (June 15, 1981).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to eliminate any potential confusion in this area, the OTS is amending &sect;563b.7(f)(1)(ii) by deleting suggestions that the appraisal report need only be a ``brief summary'' and specifying that a full appraisal report is required. The revised language codifies the current practice of OTS staff requiring a more complete and detailed description of the elements that make up an appraisal report and justification for the methodology employed. Because a full appraisal will now be required under paragraph (f)(1)(ii), the reference to ``full appraisal'' in &sect;563b.7(f)(3) is unnecessary and is deleted. The OTS expects that appraisals will continue to contain sufficient detail to support the conclusions contained therein and that appraisers will deliberate carefully in the formation of an opinion to arrive at a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro forma  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> market value that is consistent with post-conversion market values.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

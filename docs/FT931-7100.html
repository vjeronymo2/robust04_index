			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Grumbles grow at delay in filling jobs DISCONTENT is mounting in Washington over the slowness of the White House in approving appointments to senior sub-cabinet positions in the new administration. The concern, now being voiced by some cabinet members, has been heightened by the admission to hospital of Mr Les Aspin, defence secretary, for four days this week. Yesterday, Mr William Perry, selected to be his deputy, finally appeared before Senate committee confirmation hearings, but meanwhile, the Pentagon's civilian command rests with a middle-level appointee of President George Bush. The Justice Department, too, is still under hold-over Republican management pending confirmation of Ms Janet Reno as attorney-general. No other senior Justice nominations have been made, including that to the important position of solicitor-general. Open or veiled criticism of the process has come from Mr Federico Pena, transportation secretary, Mr Mike Espy, agriculture secretary, and Mr Henry Cisneros, at housing and urban development. According to yesterday's New York Times, the White House has so far submitted only 30 names to fill the nearly 300 positions subject to Senate confirmation - about half the pace of the Carter and Reagan administrations at the same stage. Two reasons are cited for the delay. First is the painfully slow process of background checks by the White House and FBI. These have been made more laborious by the need to ensure there are no skeletons in the household closet, such as afflicted Ms Zoe Baird and Judge Kimber Wood, both candidates for attorney-general. The second is the White House insistence on ethnic, gender and geographic diversity in appointments. A list submitted by Mr Cisneros was reportedly rejected because it had too many New Yorkers. More common complaints concern the search for women and members of racial minorities.</p>

			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Policy shift encourages market rally THE FIFTH anniversary of the great crash of 1987 saw London's equity market weather the expected political storm over pit closures and end a session of low volumes and high tension only marginally easier on balance as Mr Michael Heseltine modified his programme of mine shutdowns. But it was hard going throughout the day as worries about a possible government defeat over the mining industry in the House of Commons on Wednesday caused extreme concern in the foreign exchange and stock markets. The Footsie 100 Index, under substantial pressure early in the day, eventually ended only 1.7 lower at 2,562.2. The FT-SE Mid 250 index lost 5.6 at 2,380.3 and the FT-SE 350 1.2 to 1,230.1. Dealers were in sombre mood as they manned their trading desk terminals at the outset of trading. The government was given a frightful pasting in the weekend press and dealers braced themselves for an onslaught against sterling in the forex markets. Sterling duly came under heavy pressure at the outset, sliding some four pfennigs against the D-Mark and three cents against the dollar. The reaction of the stock market was for marketmakers to chop their opening prices sharply, with the Footsie retreating more than 21 points within an hour of the start of trading. Very little in the way of institutional selling pressure was forthcoming, however, and share prices embarked on a slow but steady rally as the market picked up hints that an emergency meeting of the UK Cabinet would result in a change of policy regarding the pit closures being announced in the afternoon. The rally saw the Footsie-100 pick up to show a fall of only 6.7 in mid-morning before dipping off again in the early afternoon. A determined recovery then set in and the Footsie, down more than 17 points over lunchtime, began to respond to a strong opening by Wall Street, which was followed up by the government's change of heart over the minefields. At its best the Footsie was within a point of last Friday's close, eventually closing only marginally easier on balance. Turnover in equities yesterday, amounting to 412.9m shares, was said by one leading marketmaker to have been 'particularly disappointing'. Customer business in recent sessions has been well below levels needed to provide overall profits for the London market. Retail business last Friday was Pounds 1.26bn, as the market responded to the 1 per cent cut in base rates. British Steel was the heaviest traded stock in the Footsie-100 as James Capel, the agency broker, sold a big block of stock into the market, while Barclays continued to suffer as other broking firms followed Credit Lyonnais Laing and began to factor in big losses from property and bad debts which may lead to Barclays cutting its dividend. Some observers view current market uncertainty as a good opportunity. The strategy team at Goldman Sachs, acknowledging 'the clear downside risk' said 2,400 is likely to represent the limit of any downside move and emphasised their medium-term optimism for UK equities: 'We expect the market to be substantially higher in about a year.'</p>

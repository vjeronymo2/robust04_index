			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed INTERFAX report in the "In Brief" column] </F>   [Text] Moscow -- The political and economic situation in  Russia noticeably inhibits Russians' orientation toward the  values of democracy and freedom of expression in society. Thus,  in the past five years (from December 1988 to December 1993) the  proportion of Russian citizens considering glasnost and freedom  of expression important for themselves has declined from 51 to  12 percent. This finding has been reported by the Institute for  the Sociology of Parliamentarianism directed by Nugzar Betaneli.  The poll conducted in March and April 1994 showed that even in  Moscow, where democratic trends prevail, the level of  socio-psychological intolerance has grown: The number of those  who think that not everything in Russia (people, parties,  movements, and mass media) should enjoy equal freedom of  expression has grown from 28 percent (May 1993) to 43 percent  (March 1994), while another 2 percent believe that everyone's  freedom of expression must be limited.</p>

			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LAB OWNER WHO SUPPLIED DRUG DEALERS GETS 40-YEAR PRISON TERM, $250,000 FINE  </P> <P> A laboratory owner who sold glassware and chemicals to drug dealers was  sentenced to 40 years in federal prison Monday and fined $250,000.  </P> <P> Saying Robert Miskinis is partly to blame for San Diego being described as the  "methamphetamine capital of the United States," U.S. District Judge Howard  Turrentine imposed the 40-year term sought by prosecutors.  </P> <P> Miskinis, 40, of El Cajon owned RJM Laboratories in Lakeside and Safe Labs in  Santee before the labs were seized and he was arrested in August, 1988.  </P> <P> He was convicted of operating a continuing criminal enterprise and on 10 counts  of aiding and abetting in the manufacture of methamphetamine and aiding  interstate travel in aid of racketeering.  </P> <P> "The defendant no doubt was the largest seller of the ingredients of  methamphetamine," Turrentine said. "Our little town acquired the title of the  methamphetamine capital of the United States."  </P> <P> The sentence is one of the longest given to someone convicted of drug offenses.  </P> <P> Many of Miskinis' customers are now in prison themselves. Among them are  brothers Manuel and Jack Battaglia, serving 20- and 29-year terms,  respectively, for distributing methamphetamine.  </P> <P> Under new federal sentencing guidelines, Assistant U.S. Atty. Pat Swan said,  Miskinis will have to serve 80% of the sentence, or 34 years, before being  eligible for parole.  </P> <P> "It was a well-deserved sentence," Swan said.  </P> <P> In court, Swan described Miskinis as having an "insatiable appetite for the  holy dollar."  </P> <P> "He made San Diego the methamphetamine capital of the U.S.," Swan said. "He  structured his entire business to suit (drug dealers') business. For his  assistance, he made a fortune."  </P> <P> In an Aug. 19, 1988, raid, federal agents seized Miskinis' house, business,  equipment, patents, bank accounts and retirement funds. In court, his former  attorney, John Mitchell, estimated the value of the seized assets at $4  million.  </P> <P> Miskinis' new attorney, Joseph Milchen, urged the judge to impose the minimum  sentence of 10 years in prison for the continuing criminal enterprise count.  </P> <P> Miskinis read a lengthy statement in court criticizing Mitchell's efforts in  the August trial. Turrentine responded that Mitchell provided "an excellent  defense" for Miskinis.  </P> <P> Miskinis was convicted Aug. 30.  </P></p>

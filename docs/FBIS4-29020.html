			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, June 15 (YONHAP) -- The United States had  accepted the principle of U.S. military withdrawal from South  Korea in a "secret agreement" signed with North Korea last  February, the French daily LIBERATION quoting a senior North  Korean official here reported Wednesday.    The report said that the official, Pak Tong-chun, head of  the  North Korean mission in Paris, claimed that Washington accepted  the principle of pulling 37,000 American troops out of South  Korea under the frame of a "secret" bilateral agreement which  was agreed in December 1993 in New York and concluded last  February.    "The United States asked us not to leak this, but they  breached all the promises later," Pak was quoted as saying.    The daily said Pak failed to produce any evidence and a  spokesman for the U.S. State Department declined a comment on  Pak's allegation.    Meanwhile, in an interview with the INTERNATIONAL HERALD  TRIBUNE, Pak denied North Korea's nuclear development but said  his country is prepared to wage a war if it is necessary to  safeguard "our essential national interests." He said that any  North Korean attack on the United States, China or Japan with  nuclear weapons would be a suicidal act. "We cannot even think  of attacking South Korea, our same people," Pak told the TRIBUNE.    Asserting that the United States had invented all problems  like the theory of North Korean attack simply to justify their  presence in South Korea, Pak said that North Korea has reached  the limit of patience and has no intent of making concessions  any further.</p>

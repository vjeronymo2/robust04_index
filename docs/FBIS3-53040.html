			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by army affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe] </F>   [Text] No date has been set yet for the evacuation of IDF  troops from the Gaza Strip or Jericho. Not a single Army unit  or base has been evacuated. The date will be set in accordance  with the agreement reached by Israel and the Palestinians.  Nonetheless, the IDF Logistics Branch has begun employing  outside contractors and IDF teams at dozens of locations in the  Gaza Strip and Jericho to prepare the sites for the evacuated  IDF units on the date to be determined. It is believed,  however, that the work will go on for several months after the  evacuation decision is made.    The cost of the evacuation of Gaza and Jericho is estimated  at some 500 million shekels. So far, an expenditure of  approximately 230 million shekels has been approved, of which  dozens of millions of shekels have already been spent, and this  sum does not include the cost of works on roads, travel axes,  and measures to protect the settlements.    The Army has began infrastructure work at the alternative  site set aside for the IDF units that will be evacuated from  Jericho. It has been learned that the site is being constructed  southeast of Jericho, near the settlement of Mul Nevo.    The IDF is scheduled to complete the construction of the  electronic fence that will surround the Gaza Strip by April  1995. The barrier will include intrusion-tracking dirt roads, a  paved road, an obstacle fence, and the electronic fence itself.  The barrier will be 50 meters in width, 65 km in length, and  will cost 100 million shekels. It has been decided that several  contractors will work simultaneously in order to finish building  the fence that will protect the settlements inside the Green  Line on time. The other fence that is designed to surround the  Qatif Bloc will be 17 km in length. It will also be an alarm  fence, although this is not yet final.    [Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew on 11 January carries a related  report by Sharon Sade on page A3, adding that recent estimates  drawn up by the Finance Ministry and the defense establishment  indicate that if the evacuated troops were "to take over  uninhabited buildings in the Gaza Strip settlements of Pe'at  Sade and Nisanit, the IDF could save approximately 25 million  shekels." The report adds that "the defense establishment is  finding it hard to obtain the consent of the representatives of  the religious settlements." According to defense establishment  estimates, the settlement of Netzarim's refusal to allow the IDF  to set up a post in the settlement "will result in an  expenditure of approximately 5 million shekels on the  construction of a separate outpost."]</p>

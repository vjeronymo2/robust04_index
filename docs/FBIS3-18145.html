			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "From Ciampi to Occhetto: Everyone </F> is in Favor"]    [Text] Rome -- Reactions to the agreement reached on Monday  night [21 February] between the trade unions, Fiat, and Labor  Minister Gino Giugni were characterized by a decidedly positive  tone. For CGIL [Italian General Confederation of Labor]  Secretary Bruno Trentin, "the Fiat agreement constitutes the  best which could be achieved, in a situation which is both so  serious and so full of unknowns, in particular after obtaining,  at the last moment, the government's formal involvement in an  extraordinary audit of the company's commitments." However,  Trentin's reaction is offset by that of the Essere trade union  in the CGIL which, in a memorandum, contests the agreement.    A comment on the solution of the Fiat dispute also came from  Democratic Party of the Left leader Achille Occhetto, for whom  "the FIOM [Federation of Employees and Workers in the  Metallurgical Industry] did a good thing in signing the  agreement." "The FIOM," he added "has arrived at a new and  significant position on the question of industrial policies,  which demonstrates how the real problem today is that of having  a government and a majority which can have this agreement  applied as it relates to employment prospects." Prime Minister  Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, who intervened directly on Monday to  support a positive outcome of the agreement, yesterday expressed  to Giugni "the government's appreciation for the intelligent  work of mediation and for achieving the very important agreement  in the Fiat dispute."    For CISL [Italian Confederation of Trade Unions] Deputy  Secretary General Raffaele Morese, "this is a victory for worker  participation." "The agreement reflects," he added, "a fair  amount of the CISL's philosophy." However, for former CISL  General Secretary Pierre Carniti, the agreement "is a good  thing, but the early retirements are the most senseless and  expensive of all the social shock absorbers."    Satisfaction was also expressed by Confindustria [General  Confederation of Italian Industry] Chairman Luigi Abete. Abete  described the accord as "a very important result, which  demonstrates that when the institutions on the one hand and the  competent social partners on the other hand are allowed to work  calmly, it is possible to find balanced solutions which address  labor's problems, but which also give major consideration to  problems of competitiveness."</p>

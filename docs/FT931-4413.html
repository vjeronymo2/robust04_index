			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Guiding light for mandarins: The recession has failed to hurt one of the Treasury's industrial advisers THE TREASURY must wish all its economic advisers had the characteristics of Mr Ivan Bradbury. For Mr Bradbury - owner and chairman of fast-expanding electronics company Interconnection Systems - the recession has never happened. The physicist-turned-entrepreneur is a member of the Treasury's industrial prospects committee, which meets quarterly. He reckons succeeding in business is a matter of following simple rules: investing in technology and people, close contact with customers and treating exports in the same way as domestic sales. Since Mr Bradbury set up his Pounds 37m-turnover company eight years ago staff has doubled to just over 600 and the business has become consistently profitable. Interconnection Systems' progress has been all the more noticeable given that it is based in South Shields, Tyneside - mainland Britain's biggest unemployment blackspot, where one worker in five is without a job. A business associate says of the 46-year-old Mr Bradbury: 'Much of the success is down to him. He can be a difficult character, but he's bloody intelligent and prepared to work exceptionally hard.' Mr Bradbury is probably the least known but best paid member of the Treasury committee, which was set up last year as part of a government drive to improve links with manufacturers. The committee reports to Mr Alan Budd, Treasury chief economic adviser. In the financial year to the end of last April Mr Bradbury's earnings came to Pounds 333,000. He thinks the Treasury initiative 'commendable', likening Treasury officials to pilots flying with the windows blacked out. Although on the whole he thinks the officials are 'very bright', he says that 'every now and again they need glimpses of what is happening in the world outside'. Mr Bradbury, whose previous jobs have included spells at the Ford car group and US electronics company Raychem, came into contact with Treasury officials after a meeting in the late 1970s with Sir Douglas Wass, Treasury permanent secretary between 1974 and 1983. Sir Douglas recalls: 'I was very impressed with Mr Bradbury. I learned a lot from him (about industry).' In spite of his close ties with the Treasury, Mr Bradbury criticises government economic policies for a 'lack of clear sets of values' in economic management. He says the government 'stopped the economy dead in its tracks' with the long period of high interest rates in the early 1990s. Since then it has failed to do enough to help manufacturing growth, but has relied on a 'simplistic' formula of trying to reduce inflation. Following recent cuts in interest rates and signs that the economy may be on the turn, Mr Bradbury is generally confident about recovery. Manufacturers which cannot step up exports after the 15 per cent devaluation in the pound since last September 'probably should not be trying'. He urges the government not to jeopardise an upturn by raising taxes in next week's Budget. 'At the moment people want to hear good news. The negative impact of a tax increase would be considerable,' he says. Interconnection Systems' main activity is making printed circuit boards  - building blocks for a range of electronic products including telephones, computers and automotive systems. Mr Bradbury owns 80 per cent of Interconnection Systems through a holding company called Legibus, with Schroder Ventures, an investment group, holding the rest of the shares. The factory operates 24 hours a day and makes about 9m boards a year, nearly half of them for export. Its customers include Mitsubishi, Daimler-Benz, BMW and Motorola. After buying the then lossing-making South Shields factory from the Plessey electrical group in 1985, Mr Bradbury changed the management and invested Pounds 25m in new automated machines. In the financial year ending last April his company turned in a pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.3m on sales of Pounds 31m. Profits are expected to be about Pounds 3m this year.</p>

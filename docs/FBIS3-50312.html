The MSZMP split from the former state party, the Hungarian  Socialist Workers' Party, when it changed its name to Workers  Party at the proposal of Chairman Gyula Thurmer. The  extreme-left MSZMP commemorated the anniversary of the Russian  revolution on November 7, 1993. At the celebration, which was  broadcast on television, five-pointed red stars were displayed  in contravention of the law banning the use of extremist  symbols, the letter says, adding that the party defines the 1956  Hungarian revolution a "counter-revolution."    Concerning investigations into the activity of the VNP,  Fuzessy does not exclude the possibility, according to  NEPSZABADSAG, that the party will undertake preparations to  seize power by force, and that its activity will be found to  amount to instigation against the community.    Fuzessy confirmed the information as basically correct in an  interview by the newspaper. Under the 1989 Association Law, the  Prosecutor's Office can initiate court proceedings against  law-breaking political parties. A party may be dissolved if it  commits or incites a crime, or violates the rights of others.    Independent experts estimate VNP membership as barely more  than 100.</p>

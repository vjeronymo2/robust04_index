			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Spain The peseta has been holding up well in the run-up to tomorrow's election. But that does not mean the markets can be particularly confident about the outcome. The two main parties are neck and neck: neither is likely to be able to form a government without some tough coalition negotiations with the Catalan and Basque national parties. They have been playing their cards close to their chests. Everyone would like lower interest rates. Less certain is how far a new administration will be prepared to sacrifice ERM membership to that end. The assumption is that Mr Felipe Gonzalez's Socialists would be more determined to defend the parity than the conservative opposition. If he remains prime minister, even he may come under considerable pressure. The official unemployment rate of 22 per cent may over-state the pain, but it is excruciating just the same. Some further exchange rate risk thus remains, especially given the Bank of Spain's limited reserves. Until the peseta's future becomes clearer, though, bonds are probably a better bet than equities. Not only do they yield some 4 percentage points more than German bunds; the lack of inflationary pressure implicit in Spain's weak money supply should push absolute yields lower even if the peseta left the ERM, as happened in the UK. Bond market returns could thus easily exceed any further depreciation. The equity market by contrast is much more dependent on lower short-term interest rates. That in turn requires a gesture from a reluctant Bundesbank or a radical rethink of exchange rate policy.</p>

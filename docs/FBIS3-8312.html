			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report on first day of trial of Socialist </F> Party Chairman Fatos Nano in Tirana on 5 March: "The Albanians  Again Say No to Violations of Human Rights and Freedoms,  Manipulation, and Political Persecution; The State Is Determined  To See Fatos Nano Sentenced and in Prison; Fatos Nano Accuses,  Prosecutors Qeleshi and Gjokutaj Fall Silent and Sweat"]    [Text] Because of the situation created in Tirana the day  before yesterday [4 March], with its associated tension, panic,  anxiety, and terror in the hearts of those in power, the Tirana  Court on Durres Street, before the start of the trial of Fatos  Nano, Socialist Party [PS] chairman and parliamentary deputy,  was surrounded by hundreds of uniformed policemen, dozens of  members of the special rapid deployment forces, and high-level  officers from the Public Order Ministry armed with shields, blue  helmets, bulletproof vests, rubber truncheons, Kalashnikov  rifles, and of course their whistles and handcuffs. This was  all to guarantee what President Berisha promised: openness,  judicial independence, and the enforcement of legal standards  and procedures in the trial of the opposition leader.    According to announcements, the trial was to take place in  open court but with admission by invitation issued by the Tirana  Court because of the size of the hall. Shaqir Vukaj, deputy  chairman of the Albanian parliament, was not allowed entry to  the courtroom to follow the proceedings. Meanwhile, dozens of  policemen who were not on escort duty were present in the court.    Judge Agim Bendo opened the session at 0900. The case's  prosecutors were Arben Qeleshi and that strange little fellow  Genc Gjokutaj. Facing them in the dock were opposition leader  Fatos Nano, Sokrat Plaka, Hasan Allkja, and Robert Gjini. After  presenting the bench of judges to the court, Mr. Bendo turned to  the defendants and asked whether they recognized the court.  Fatos Nano then read the statement we publish under the title,  "Even Though You Do Not Have the Civil Courage to Face Up to Us,  I Agree To Stand Before You, Because the Law Stands Between Us."  Defense counsel Perparim Sanxhaku then spoke, making a detailed  summary based on individual articles and laws of the Penal Code,  describing all the violations of procedure committed from PS  Chairman Fatos Nano's arrest to his imprisonment and the  rejection as inadmissible of the submissions of Fatos Nano and  his lawyers. The lawyers of the other defendants also protests  procedural violations. The lawyer Sanxhaku called for the court  to threat Nano's case separately from those of the other  defendants, to return the files to the prosecutor, and to  commute Nano's arrest. The other defendants' lawyers made the  same requests on behalf of their clients. Prosecutor Gjokutaj  then asked for one hour to reply to the lawyer's requests.  After one hour he replied in his own way; i.e., he gave no  reply. The bench then withdrew to decide on the lawyers'  requests. At 1500, Judge Bendo seemed to repeat Prosecutor  Gjukotaj's reply. He rejected the lawyers' requests, with the  exception of commuting Sokrat Plaka's arrest. After this  decision, Deputy Fatos Nano stated that he was breaking all  relations with the bench. Lawyer Tirana supported and explained  Mr. Nano's legal decision and asked for the court to remove Mr.  Nano and his two lawyers from the court. Mr. Bendo considered  this an unreasonable attitude on the part of the lawyers, and  gave them 10 minutes to reconsider. However, it seems that  these 10 minutes were less for the lawyers to reconsider than  for Mr. Bendo himself. Mr. Bendo opened the session, asking  Prosecutor Qeleshi to read the charge. For 25 minutes, Qeleshi  reread for the umpteenth time the State Control Commission's  report published by Blerim Cela. After this, Mr. Bendo asked  the accused whether they accepted the charges. Opposition  leader Fatos Nano repeated his stand in his statement, "I Have  Broken All Relations With the Court." Lawyer Sanxahku reminded  Mr. Bendo of the need for 10 minutes' break, but the latter  interrupted him, saying that the court's decision could not be  opposed at this moment. The defendants did not accept the  charges. Mr. Bendo closed the session, to reopen it at 1000  today with the questioning of opposition leader Fatos Nano.   <H5>    Courtroom Incidents </H5>   Prosecutor Genc Gjokutaj bellowed instead of giving a reply  to charges of violations of procedure by the Prosecutor's Office  during the investigation of the Nano affair.    From the manner in which he read, it was clear he was not  reading his own writing.    Meanwhile, in contrast to his junior colleague Gjokutaj,  Chief Prosecutor Arben Qeleshi, whom Fatos Nano called a puppet  prosecutor required by the state solely to sign arrest warrants,  showed himself able to read fluently a typed charged sheet that  bore the signature of his deputy Dervishi at the end.    The presiding judge Agim Bendo tried to maintain the  seriousness of the court, and succeeded when he was reminded of  the Arsidi trial and his trip to Paris with Ilir Hoti, who is  now in prison. At this moment, cameras flashed in the courtoom  to preserve on celluloid the expression of his face.    At the end of the first session, Mr. Bendo broke a taboo of  trials under the dictatorship by allowing the defendants to meet  those of their relations who were in the courtroom.    Kurt Kola, chairman of the Association of Former Political  Prisoners and Victims of Persecution, was the most attentive  person in the hall. Who knows what ideas swirled through the  mind of this martyr of democracy as he heard the denunciations  of the violations of the human rights to which he and his  association are so attached, exceeding in their dedication even  the Meksi Government and the former Communist President Sali  Berisha. Let us remember how Kola once let off his revolver in  Kavaje as a sign of understanding and conciliation among  Albanians and then wiped the barrel before thrusting it back in  his belt.  <H3>  Fatos Nano Addresses the Bench: "Even Though You Do Not  Have the Civil Courage To Face Up to Us, I Agree To Stand Before  You, Because the Law Stands Between Us" </H3>   Your honor, this is a political trial, because it has been  seriously prejudiced by the attitudes, statements, and public  and private activities of persons associated or not with the  judicial process, from the head of state, the chairman of the  People's Assembly, the chairman of the ruling Democratic Party,  the chairman of the Association of Former Political Prisoners  and Victims of Persecution,, the president of the Appeal Court,  etc., down to the most recent chairman of the Democratic Party  Youth Forum.    Of course, at the appropriate time, I will ask for their  well- documented public pressure on the judiciary to be taken as  evidence of the political character of the trial, and will call  on these persons, together with their "minion," as witnesses to  this and to other private acts.    Because of these circumstances, and because I do not  identify  justice with individual names, I am indifferent to the selection  and composition of your bench. This indifference extends to  yourself as presiding judge, despite the substantial and strong  evidence that compromises your position as an independent judge  such as the law demands. I will mention here only one piece of  evidence. The state is using against you "the Paris Charter,"  by which I mean not the well-known Paris Charter on democratic  principles recognized throughout the world, but the one  connected with the "Arsidi affair," and your involvement in this  scandal, in tandem with Hoti, on the side of citizen Berisha.  The latter, in his capacity as president and chairman of the  Supreme Coucil of Justice, quashed your last moral stand when  you submitted your resignation to this Council, of which you are  still a member. The tandem has now become a quartet, and, as on  other occasions, you are coming to this trial after meetings  last Monday [1 Mar] and between 0900 and 1300 yesterday with  President Berisha, at which P. Martini, A. Qeleshi, and F.  Dervishi were also present, in Villa Number Four near the Palace  of Brigades, where the Supreme Council of Justice now meets to  discuss the "Nano affair" and many others. Thus, you are  prisoners in a villa-prison, while we are free, as you also see  from the press.    In conclusion, even though you do not have the civil courage  to face up to us, I agree to stand before you, because the law  stands between us.    Thank you.    Fatos Nano, PS chairman, People's Assembly deputy.</p>

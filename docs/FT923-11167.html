			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Markets: No covering up the gloom - London NEVER mind the occasional actress. Ministers would surely like a privacy law which enabled them sometimes to draw a discreet veil over the state of the British economy - and the stock market, when it gets into bearish mood. Domestic unease about recovery, fuelled by falling overseas markets, produced a grim week in the City. Joining the ERM was meant to banish the term 'U-turn' from the lexicon of economic policy. So, there was something both impressive and disquieting about the speed with which the government backed down from its confrontation with the building societies. Cutting the interest rate offered by the new National Savings bond was sufficient to prevent a rise in home loan rates - at least for the time being - but the societies insisted that the government's growing appetite for retail savings was keeping them under severe pressure. The societies saw a net outflow of Pounds 314m from their savings deposits in June, the worst monthly figure for six years. A rise in mortgage rates would have dealt a blow to consumer confidence, on which so many hopes of domestic recovery are now pinned. That could not be contemplated, given that retail sales were on Wednesday revealed to have fallen 0.2 per cent last month. The government looks increasingly boxed-in. The longer recovery is delayed, the more demands are made on public spending, with lower tax income and higher unemployment costs. Concern about the ballooning public deficit also puts pressure on the pound. Such fears could be eased by increasing interest rates, but that itself would further postpone any recovery. The government sought on Wednesday to reassure the financial markets by announcing a new policy which will keep the increase in public spending below the expected level of economic growth. Domestic concerns were not the whole story, however. Turmoil on the world's currency markets started the ball rolling downwards on Monday, with the European bourses showing their biggest one-day fall since the Moscow coup in 1991. The chart shows that the FTSE-100 index has lost all its gains since the election of April 9, but it also illustrates that London is by no means the worst-performing market over that period. A pattern of sorts emerged in the week, with 28-point falls in the FTSE-100 on Monday and Wednesday being redressed partly by bounces of just under 12 points on Tuesday and Thursday. But sentiment on Friday remained gloomy, with the market closing down 22.3 points - a fall of 54.7 points on the week as a whole. Official intervention in global currency markets sought to check the rise of the D-Mark and slide of the dollar, a battle which kept sterling mainly on the sidelines. But Spain's increase of its interest rates on Thursday left the UK as one of the few European countries which has not tightened monetary policy in response to last week's rise in German interest rates. That takes us back to the London market and its fear that the next move in UK interest rates might be upwards, choking off any domestic recovery. Messages on the recessionary front remain mixed, with gloom from retailers and the Engineering Employers' Federation being offset by cautious optimism from the British Chambers of Commerce. Whenever recovery does come, it will be too late to save parts of Britain's troubled machine tools industry. Matrix Churchill, a Midlands-based group, went into receivership only days after Beaver Engineering Group, the Norwich-based machine tool-maker. Companies reporting this week were quizzed carefully over how they were dealing with tough trading conditions. Reuters, a stock market star of the 1980s, was marked down savagely after the international informational and news group accompanied a 10 per cent increase in profits with a cautious statement on its outlook for revenue growth. The shares closed yesterday at 1011pp, down 153p on the week. On the other hand, shares in Boots rose after the diversified retailing group told its AGM that it was 'bucking the trend' and had increased sales by 11 per cent since April. SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-US drugs and consumer products group, once again demonstrated the defensive strengths of pharmaceuticals by reporting a 10 per cent rise in pre-tax profits. That could bode well for Wellcome Trust, the charity which is selling about half of its 73.5 per cent stake in Wellcome, the drugs group. The strike price and allocation will be announced on Monday. The largest deal of the week came from British Airways which is paying Dollars 750m for a stake in USAir, the sixth-biggest US airline, in a move that will create the world's biggest airline alliance. BA, which was privatised in 1987, has long sought a foothold in the lucrative North American market. The biggest concern for the market - and the government - is that economic recovery, even when it comes, is likely to be very gradual. There is certainly unlikely to be any marked turning point in the looming dog days of August when low trading volumes and empty City offices can make for a skittish trading climate. On Monday, the prime minister repeated his commitment to staying in the ERM, describing advocates of sterling's devaluation as 'pessimist and defeatists.' This 'steady-as-she-goes' course might eventually steer the economy into the safe haven of resumed growth with low inflation. But this week's scrape with National Savings and unsettled international markets demonstrate that reefs abound.</p>

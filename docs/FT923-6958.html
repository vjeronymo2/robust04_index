			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Victaulic holds steady at Pounds 7m A FAVOURABLE cash position at Victaulic offset difficult trading conditions enabling the pipes and fittings maker to report unchanged pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.9m for the six months to June 30. Turnover fell from Pounds 57.4m to Pounds 51.2m, mainly reflecting reduced demand for pipelines from British Gas which has cut capital expenditure. This is because of uncertainties over the future structure and ownership of British Gas's network following the referral of these matters to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The uncertainty is likely to continue into next year. In the group's other main market - water - some companies reduced investment on the repair and maintainance of mains, affecting sales of Viking Johnson, which is involved in the refurbishment of mains. Trading profit fell from Pounds 6.79m to Pounds 6.46m. However, net cash of Pounds 10m resulted in interest received of Pounds 461,000 (Pounds 57,000). Cost reductions, a decline in the workforce and increased margins of 12.6 per cent (11.8 per cent) also helped. The interim dividend is 2.5p (2.35p) on earnings unchanged at 10.3p.</p>

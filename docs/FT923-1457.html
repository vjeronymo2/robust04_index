			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Collor crisis likely to slow debt accord THE Brazilian government has completed negotiations over a detailed debt restructuring agreement with leading creditor banks in the face of the corruption scandal surrounding President Fernando Collor. The agreement, now being examined by lawyers from both sides, will have to be translated into Portuguese and approved by the Brazilian Senate before it goes to all lending banks for final approval. An agreement in principle was reached on July 9. However, it may be next year before the accord, which allows banks six options in the restructuring of Dollars 44bn (Pounds 24.8bn) of medium-term debt, is finally completed. Brazilian officials were quoted by bankers yesterday as saying it would take a month or more to win Senate approval, and the final completion might not take place until next year. Bankers attending the International Monetary Fund-World Bank meetings in Washington also reported progress between banks and the Argentine government on a Dollars 23bn debt accord. This has been held up as an estimated 80 per cent of banks chose one of the two concessionary bonds on offer - the so-called par bonds which cost significantly more for the Argentine government to finance. The government has said that a 65 per cent take up of par bonds would be satisfactory, a figure which leading banks consider reasonable. Now banks have to be persuaded to increase their take up of the alternative discount bonds. Turmoil surrounding Mr Collor is transfixing domestic politicians and is expected to slow progress on the Brazil accord. Furthermore, the government is out of compliance with an International Monetary Fund standby programme, which will have to be renegotiated before banks agree finally to close the deal. Mr Collor's lawyers were due to present his defence to a congressional commission by last night, but were expected to make no attempt to prove the president's innocence. Instead, in an effort to win time, they were expected to demand that his accusers present proof against him. Their 20-30 page document is expected to attack the congressional investigation which has implicated the president, question the lifting of banking secrecy and ask for 20 witnesses to be called. The commission was expected to reject these arguments on the basis that Mr Collor has already had four months to present his defence and that they are merely presenting a recommendation, while the actual judging of Mr Collor will be done by the Senate.</p>

			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / International Company News: Daimler to raise payout for first time in six years DAIMLER-BENZ, the German motor, aerospace and electronics group, will raise its dividend for the first time in six years after an 8 per cent rise in net profits in 1991, to DM1.9bn (Dollars 1.15bn). Analysts said the decision to increase the payment by DM1 to DM13 a share at a time of threatened industrial unrest over pay claims reflected the group's desire to made a favourable impact on the stock market ahead of a DM2bn rights issue later this year. Daimler indicated last year that profits would justify a higher dividend. The rise in profits came despite costs of more than DM500m at its AEG electronics subsidiary for the closure of its loss-making Wilhelmshaven office equipment plant. However, sales of the new S-class executive car, priced higher than its predecessor, have been favourable, and the truck market has been buoyant after German unification. At the same time, concern over high German costs, especially for labour, has prompted the group's Mercedes-Benz vehicle subsidiary to announce job cuts of some 20,000 in the next few years, although it wants to avoid redundancies.</p>

			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / Letter: Prudence should continue to have merit Sir, Having spent nearly 10 years as chairman of the financial committee of a successful local authority, perhaps I could comment on the suggestion that the taxpayer should compensate the local authorities which lost money with the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. The higher the return on money lent, in theory and in practice, the higher the risk; and those placing the money should have been made aware of that. The particular circumstances of the largest loser - the Western Isles - gives cause for concern. I see no reason why those of us who are prudent should always be expected to bail out the foolish - if we did, prudence would have no merit. Jeremy C Kilner, Choppards Mill, Huddersfield</p>

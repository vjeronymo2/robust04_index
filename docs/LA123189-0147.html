			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOW TO TREAT -- AND NOT TREAT -- YOUR DOG  </P> <P> Re Dianne Klein's column "If You Really Love Your Dog, You'll Treat It Like  One" (Dec. 12):  </P> <P> I find the contents extremely disturbing. It would appear that the columnist  interviewed Sandra Ackerman (who admits to being a self-taught behaviorist),  who reportedly made some pronouncements pertaining to the treatment of  companion animals, specifically dogs, that unwittingly encourage  miscommunication and consequent mistreatment of many pets.  </P> <P> Dogs must have the social interaction and affection of their owners. Depriving  them of touch, petting, stroking and other emotional support is cruel,  inappropriate and counterproductive. It is also dangerous because,  unfortunately, too many owners will accept Ackerman's advice as carte blanche  to keep their companion animals in the back yard. The result of such emotional  and physical deprivation is too frequently a variety of behavior problems.  </P> <P> Of course, dogs should be treated as dogs! This does not mean that they should  not be loved -- and shown that love. One cannot spoil a living being with love,  only permissiveness.  </P> <P> When I battle, on a daily basis, the outmoded attitudes that "it's just a dumb  beast who needs only food and shelter" and similar other archaic and  misinformed ideas, and I resolve serious behavior and problems by showing love  and affection with educated methods, then such a column is out of place and  adds to the already-disastrous condition of companion animals.  </P> <P> C.

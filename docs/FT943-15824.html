			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Dixons Although its share price scarcely reflects it, Dixons has made great strides in recent years. The company has done its best to extricate itself from disastrous diversifications. More stringent management has been introduced and some progress has even been made towards providing half-way decent service in its shops. Dixons' accounts have been tidied up - despite it slipping Pounds 5m of gilts sales through the interest receivables line. Yet even these efforts may be insufficient to salvage its battered shares. Dixons may have turned itself into a reasonable business. Unfortunately, its main market seems to be turning against it. Electrical retailing has always been a tricky game thanks to severe price deflation. The added complication now is that too many others want to play. Capacity is likely to increase sharply, making sales increases harder to achieve. Dixons is itself accelerating its out-of-town opening programme. Its chief rival, Comet, is doing the same. For some perverse reason, cossetted regional electricity companies are also trying to become rough-and-tumble shopkeepers. That suggests the industry's margin structure will continue to be squeezed - especially now that warehouse clubs are testing new price floors. The only way to escape the capacity crunch would be to diversify. But given Dixons' history, that might not be well received. Dixons' yield, which has risen above the market average, offers some attractions. But it hardly compensates for the risks.</p>

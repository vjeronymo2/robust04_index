			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / House starts down 14% THE recent rise in house sales has yet to find its way through to increased output by house builders, according to figures published yesterday by the Environment Department. The number of new homes started by private builders in the three months to the end of March fell by 14 per cent compared with the corresponding period last year. Builders say the improvement in sales has occurred only recently and has come too late to offset sharply lower sales in January and February. They have been selling from stock rather than starting new construction in what remains a fragile market in spite of reductions in interest rates. The number of new homes started by builders in March fell to 12,600 from 15,400 last year.</p>

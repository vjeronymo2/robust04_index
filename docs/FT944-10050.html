			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Unilever up 6.4% at 9 months - Sales surge in ice cream and iced tea but detergents decline A surge in sales of ice cream and iced tea, plus a more favourable economic environment around the world, helped Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group, raise third quarter pre-tax profits by 11 per cent from Pounds 651m to Pounds 724m. The result slightly exceeded market forecasts and marked an acceleration in the rate of profit growth. Profits for the nine months to September 30 were up 6.4 per cent at Pounds 1.78bn (Pounds 1.68bn) compared with a 3 per cent rise at the half year. Ice cream benefited from a hot summer in Europe, where Unilever has about 40 per cent of the market, and from the inclusion of Breyers, the US maker acquired at the end of last year. Ice cream plus other strongly growing products such as speciality chemicals and personal products compensated for a decline in detergents where profits fell despite heavy cost cutting. Unilever declined to disclose exact figures but said 'negative publicity had had an undeniable impact'. Unilever had high hopes this spring when it launched Persil Power detergent in the UK and Omo Power on the Continent. But a flaw in the products was exploited by Procter &amp; Gamble, Unilever's rival, through a hard-hitting media campaign. Market shares of the Power detergents have fallen from launch levels in the UK and the Netherlands, where the campaign was strongest, but were up 30 per cent in France where consumers were unmoved by the campaign, Unilever said. The group said it had raised promotional spending in an effort to rebuild Power sales. Sales of its other detergents had risen. A rationalisation in its North American detergent business helped halt the decline in market share, Sir Michael Perry, chairman, said. Consumer products generally were ahead in North America, pushing third quarter operating profits in the region up 29 per cent to Pounds 155m (Pounds 120m) on sales ahead 4 per cent to Pounds 1.54bn (Pounds 1.48m). European operating profits were ahead 12 per cent to Pounds 452m (Pounds 403m) on sales up 7.5 per cent to Pounds 4.2bn (Pounds 3.9bn). The rest of the world rose 10 per cent to Pounds 169m (Pounds 153m) on sales 18 per cent higher at Pounds 2.01bn (Pounds 1.7bn). Interest rose from Pounds 45m to Pounds 60m in the quarter as net debt rose to Pounds 1.9bn at September 30 from Pounds 1.5bn a year earlier. The UK interim dividend is raised by 7 per cent to 6.51p (6.08p). The Dutch dividend was held at Fl 1.48. Third quarter earnings per share rose to 24.09p (21.94p) giving 60.22p (58.32p) for the nine months. See Lex</p>

His speech was well  received by all of the NPC deputies.    First of all, Lu pointed out: Since the breakdown of the  Sino-British talks, the work of the PWC has become heavier. The  PWC is divided into five groups, i.e. the political affairs  group, the economic group, the legal group, the security group,  and the culture and education group. For some time now, the  five groups have practically held meetings once a month and have  initially exchanged views on many issues, but no final  conclusions have been made.    The political affairs group has concentrated for some time  on  discussing the formation of the first government and legislative  council, as well as the relationship between the executive and  the legislature. On the formation of the first government, the  first question is the chief executive. Candidates for chief  executive will not and should not be discussed by the PWC, so  this question has not been discussed at all. What has been  discussed is mostly when the chief executive will be chosen.  There are two views on whether the chief executive should be  chosen sooner or later, and both have logic. Lu said: If a  consensus cannot be reached, views will be submitted to the  preparatory committee, which will choose.    On the formation of the first legislative council, most are  inclined to leave the existing 21 functional constituencies  unchanged. There are differing views about which the nine new  functional constituencies should be. A fairly unanimous view is  that China-funded enterprises should be regarded as a functional  constituency.    The economic group is now divided into four special  subgroups, i.e. the new airport issue, financial issues, issue  of capital construction in the two places (how capital  construction on the mainland and Hong Kong is coordinated), and  the retirement insurance issue. The four subgroups are now  working separately. The economic group will next study the  issue of Hong Kong real estate policy. Prices of land and  housing in Hong Kong have indeed reached a level that cannot be  sustained by ordinary residents. Ordinary people virtually  cannot afford to buy a flat. This is indeed a big problem.    The legal group is now examining Hong Kong laws clause by  clause. According to the provisions of the Basic Law, the  existing laws are basically applicable and will continue to be  valid beyond 1997. However, if some laws contravene the Basic  Law, the NPC will declare them null and void.    Some time ago, the law and order group focused on the right  of abode and SAR passport issues. On the question of SAR  passports, most people hope they can be issued before 1997 so  that people can hold SAR passports to travel or discuss business  abroad after 1 July 1997. As for those permanent Hong Kong  residents who go abroad to gain foreign citizenship and then  return to Hong Kong, Lu said his personal view is that this  should be handled in a relaxed manner as far as possible.  Specific measures to solve this problem are still being studied.    The culture and education group is studying the issue of  textbooks. This is because publishing circles want to have the  relevant principles laid down early so that they are able to  compile textbooks according to these principles and print them  for selection and use by 1997.</p>

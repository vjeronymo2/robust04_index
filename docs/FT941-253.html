			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / De Benedetti telecoms reward Mr Carlo De Benedetti, chairman of Olivetti, yesterday said the winning of the Italian mobile telecommunications licence by a consortium led by his computer group had rewarded 'three years of enthusiasm'. Late on Monday the government announced that Omnitel-Pronto Italia had been awarded the licence for Italy's Europe-wide GSM network over a rival offer from the Unitel consortium, which grouped Fiat, Fininvest, Vodafone and BellSouth. Olivetti's shares yesterday rose 2.5 per cent, by mid-session, on the Milan stock market, against a static market. The 15-year licence has been valued at up to L4,300bn (Dollars 2.54bn) and will pit Omnitel-Pronto Italia against the state-controlled Sip domestic network, which had held a monopoly in the mobile phones market.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 21 (YONHAP) -- Prime Minister Yi  Hoe-chang on Monday categorically denied as "totally groundless"  some recent foreign press reports that made the Korean situation  look as if tension is building up.    "It is true North Korea has massed troops and weapons in  areas along the truce line," said Yi. "But, this is far from  being anything new." He emphasized that there have been no  signs of any unusual military movement in North Korea in  connection with the nuclear question.    "In fact, I am displeased at those foreign press reports  that  tended to describe the Korean situation as a crisis," Yi said.  He said the basic position of the government is that the two  Koreas should regard each other as partners in pursuit of  coexistence and co-prosperity.    "However, we cannot accept North Korea as a partner only in  a  circumstance where they behaves as if they have nuclear arms in  their hands and persist in trying to communize the whole  peninsula," he said.    In his testimony, Deputy Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok said  North Korea may possess plutonium enough to produce about two  atomic bombs, but at the moment it is hard to say North Korea  has produced nuclear weapons.    Yi said whether North Korea has developed nuclear arms would  be determined once full international and inter-Korean nuclear  inspections are implemented thoroughly.    Yi who is also national unification minister said the  exchange of special envoys between South and North Korea should  be carried out before third-round U.S.-North Korea talks take  place. When special envoys are exchanged, the two Koreas would  discuss the nuclear question and the issue of implementing the  basic South-North agreement, he said.    Also speaking at the assembly session, Foreign Minister Han  Sung-chu said that the disused Russian submarines being sold to  foreign countries are of a kind which can be used as none but  scrap. Of the 12 disused Russian submarines, one has been  delivered to North Korea, said Han, adding that he understands  Russia is planning to send a verification team to North Korea to  witness the disintegration of the submarine sold to North Korea.    Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae told the assembly that at the  moment it is not proper for his ministry to take the initiative  in repealing the Team Spirit exercise system.    "The Team Spirit is one of the strong means of pressuring  North Korea into giving up nuclear development," Yi said.</p>

			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / View from peaks of progress: What a photograph of Everest tells us about our values A REVOLTING and revealing photograph was published in the May edition of High Mountain Sports, the official magazine of the British Mountaineering Council. It was taken by the French photographer, Pierre Royer, and shows the scene at 26,000 feet on the South Col of Everest. It is a scene of filth, devastation and pollution. The refuse of countless expeditions is scattered almost as far as the lens can see. We are told that the litter on the plateau just below the summit weighs about 20 tons, and that yet another expedition will have to be organised to remove the mess. Among the detritus are between five and nine corpses - no one seems to know how many. Some have been left open to the elements, others hidden under stones. The picture was published some weeks before the near national hysteria in Britain over the climb to the summit of Everest by Rebecca Stephens, the first Englishwoman to succeed in the attempt. It is of course, a great achievement: the corpses on the South Col are grim testament to the hazards. But I wonder what Stephens thought when she surveyed the mess, which looks like nothing so much as Piccadilly Circus during the dustbin men's strike of 1979. She probably did not have much time to think. There are so many people climbing Everest that any one who hesitates loses his, or her, place in the queue to the summit. I suppose it will be claimed as a wonderful thing that what was once a virtual impossibility is now almost routine. At about the same time as Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay made the first full ascent of Everest, Sir Roger Bannister became the first person to break the four minute mile. That has become even more of a commonplace than climbing the world's highest mountain. Athletic records fall almost daily, and each fresh edition of The Guinness Book of Records charts the unfailing progress of man towards some ultimate and as yet unquantifiable ideal of fitness and fastness. Does this mean that we are evolving into some race of supermen and women? I suppose that physically and medically, that might happen. And indeed much of the health journalism which has spread from the US seems predicated on the notion that we all not only could, but should, become physically perfect. The only drawback to this ideal, the inevitability of death and decay, is never mentioned. This form of secular body worship, the notion that we can become physically perfect, is probably harmless enough, and less morally hazardous than most emanations of the displaced religious impulse. The danger lies in the illusion that if we are continuously advancing physically, we must also be evolving mentally and creatively. This belief lies behind much that is meretricious in art and literature. Artists who come up with something new are lionised, awarded the Turner Prize and appear on late night television. The fact that the new idea might be a pile of bricks, or a crucifix in a tub of urine, just to take two recent examples of acclaimed new art, seems to cause no concern among believers in the progressive ideal. Somehow the thought that what is new might be regressive, a defeat for mankind, does not occur. The intellectual sphere of human attainment becomes as value-free as a one-mile race, or a climb up a mountain. Perhaps if the athletic records were to dry up, if the life expectancy of the western male were to cease its unremitting rise, there might be a greater willingness to acknowledge that artistic and literary standards could be declining, and that we have more to learn from the scarcely digested old than the indigestible new. The photograph of the human refuse and remains on Everest is as good an illustration as any of the descent of man, even as he/she climbs the peaks: it is hard to imagine the mountaineers of 40 years ago leaving bodies unmarked and unburied, for someone else to clear up, if not honour. Lord Hunt, the leader of the 1953 ascent of Everest has described the conduct of his successors as 'unthinkable . . . inexcusable'. But I doubt that Lord Hunt's words and Royer's photograph will influence the public as much as the smiles and exhilaration of Stephens. Mankind can stand only so much reality.

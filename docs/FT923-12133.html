The shares will be allocated by August 3. Meanwhile, the second tranche of 300,000 shares for small investors went on offer yesterday. BRE's employees have been sold a further 200,000 shares at half price. In all, 47.5 per cent of BRE's equity is being offered, with the rest held by several state-owned banks, the Foreign Trade Ministry, and around 440 state and private companies. The bank reported net profits of 56bn zloty (Dollars 4.2m) for 1991. Mr Krzysztof Szwarc, BRE's managing director, said net profits for the first half of this year would come out at about 79bn zloty. The sale is Poland's first bank privatisation. The BRE is being advised by N. M. Rothschild and audited by Moore Stephens.</p>

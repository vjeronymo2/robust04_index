			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / International Company News: Indian tea company ahead at midway Tata Tea, India's biggest plantation company, reported a record net profit of Rs360m (Dollars 11.5m) in the six months to September 30, against Rs350m a year earlier, even though tea prices have remained depressed because of oversupply, writes Kunal Bose in Calcutta. Sales fell marginally to Rs1.8bn. In the first half, the company's export earnings rose Rs20m to Rs314m. However, Mr Krishna Kumar, managing director, said export prospects for the remainder of the year 'do not look too buoyant' because of continuing difficulties in exporting black tea to some countries.</p>

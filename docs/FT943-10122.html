			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Food and Drink: Having me some fun with the crawfish - Nicholas Woodsworth joins Cajun fishermen and samples their catch 'Jambalaya, crawfish pie, file gumbo . . . Son of a gun, gonna have me some fun, On the bayou . . .' I had heard the song many times, as I expect most people have. It is a rambunctious, toe-tapping hymn to the food and exuberant way of life of the Cajuns of backwoods Louisiana. In fact, I had heard it so often while dining in New Orleans that I was getting downright tired of it. Ruminating over a julep, I decided it was time to stop listening and start imitating. From the tourist restaurants of the French Quarter, the levees of the Atchafalaya Basin - the largest freshwater swamp in north America - are just four hours away. I decided to have a little fun on the bayou myself, and go crawfishing. So it was, a few mornings later, that I found myself standing in a drizzle in a pitch-dark sugar-cane field on the edge of swamp country south-east of Lafayette. I was waiting for a couple of Cajuns, Horace Broussard and Moses Rebert, to arrive from nearby St Martinville. Horace and Moses were energetic, baseball-capped young men in foul-weather gear driving a shiny pick-up truck. Off we splashed through the cane fields, the tyres slipping and spinning on a dirt road made soggy by days of heavy rain. It was too early and too dark to see the flooded rice field where we stopped at last, and too cold and wet to enjoy sitting in the little flat-bottomed skiff that we pulled from the bullrushes at the edge of the water. Perched on an aluminium seat, my bottom was quickly numbed. Some fun on the bayou, I thought, shivering as Horace whipped the engine into life and we pulled away from the bank. I fell into a daydream of fragrant coffee and beignets being served at that very moment in the early-opening cafes at the New Orleans market. All I could smell was mud. Slowly, though, the day dawned, the drizzle let up and the world around us took on a misty shape. I gazed around. Horace calls this work 'running the pond'. It was an extraordinarily large pond, though - we were floating across acres of silvery-grey water, the surface broken only by the protruding tips of long rows of thin metal stakes. From a leafless bough on the near shore, a curious owl stared down. Snowy egrets, their heads and necks making perfect 'S' shapes, stood motionless in the brown, dead rushes. Like us, they were interested in catching crawfish. Lying skewered at the bottom of each metal stake, in about 2ft of water, sat a wire mesh trap that works on the same principle as a lobster pot. Lured into the trap through a narrow, one-way opening by a tasty morsel of bait, the unwary victim finds it cannot make its way out and, soon after, becomes a tasty morsel itself. As we ran the pond, chugging up and down the rows of stakes, Moses in the bow scooped the traps from the water, dumped a dozen or so wriggling little creatures from each into a suspended, nylon-mesh sack, and handed the trap to his partner at the rear. Before the stern of the skiff had passed the stake, Horace, one hand on the tiller, had re-baited the trap with a fish head and dropped it back down in place. I sat in the middle beside the fast-filling sacks and contemplated the twisting, tail-flipping, claw-snapping little beasts before me. In France, they are called ecrivisses and cost a bomb. In Australia, they are yabbies and are rare enough to be the subject of midnight raids on farmers' reservoirs and lakes. In Louisiana, they are crawfish, crawdaddies or mudbugs - anything but crayfish - and are found in vast quantities in freshwater bayous, swamps and flooded fields throughout the state. Cajuns, who have traditionally thrown into the cooking pot just about anything that can be hunted, fished or trapped, have been eating these miniature, lobster-like shellfish ever since they settled around the Atchafalaya Basin in the 1700s. But, in the 1950s, the humble crawfish - swamp food for the poor man - achieved a new, elevated status. It became the subject of a nascent industry - commercial farming in stocked ponds - at precisely the time Cajuns were re-discovering their rich and different French-based culture. The result was that the crawfish became a sort of mascot of Cajun regeneration. It moved rapidly from the homes and bars of the Basin to the restaurants of New Orleans and on to elegant tables around the world. Today, crawfishing is big business in Louisiana. Followed closely by China, the state is the world's biggest producer, harvesting more than 100m lbs every year. Crawfishermen aside, just about everyone else around the Basin - bait shops, marinas, trap-makers, boat-builders, pond owners, peelers and processors - depends on the crawfish for a living (to say nothing, of course, of the tourist industry: in the summer, it is almost impossible not to stumble across a fiddle-scraping, beer-guzzling crawfish festival). I left Horace and Moses to their endless rows of traps - with more than 1,000 in three Atlantic-size ponds, they had their work cut out. I drove through rice and soya bean fields, past shacks surrounded by junk and old cars and through thick, waterlogged forests of black willow and cypress trees. Finally, miles from anywhere, at the point where terra firma gives way to alligator country, I stopped in at Crawdad Unlimited, one man's little empire in the swamps. Buddy Duchamp is an amalgam of two generations, a mixture of old-style swamp Cajun and high-tech entrepreneur. I met him in his panelled office, his fingers skipping restlessly over a computer keyboard; he was trying to project catch totals for the coming season and scheming ways to break into the French market. Outside, the freezing units of his new plant were humming and the automatic peeling machines banged away. Buddy's cousin, Phillip, was going to show me a second kind of crawfishing: deep-water swamp fishing. While he fuelled his boat, I wandered past the petrol pumps to the more old-fashioned side of Crawdad Unlimited: a bar, a restaurant serving all the beasts that can be hunted, fished or trapped in the surrounding swamp, and a grocery store. There were deer heads and mounted bass hanging over blueberry cheese danishes. Stuffed foxes and bobcats glared glassily from above chocolate Twinkies. Wild turkeys, martins and squirrels overlooked cases of cold beer and Dr Pepper. No one could doubt Buddy's Cajun origins here. I had a chat with Katherine Blanchard, who was sitting behind the cash register. She used to go to school by boat. She agreed that, in spite of the intrusion of roads and modern life, many of the favourite traditions, feasts and get-togethers of the Basin had survived. Take a crawfish boil, she said. When her own family of 15 gathered for a boil, it needed at least five sacks of crawfish - 200lb - to satisfy its needs. The great thing, she added, was that one needed only to jump out the back door into a boat to fetch them. If I had jumped out of Buddy's back door on my own, I would have been lost in five minutes. The Basin, which collects run-off from the Mississippi river and takes about 25 per cent of its flow, is large: about 20 miles wide and 150 miles long. It teems with wildlife and, below water, with crawfish. With all signs of civilisation falling behind, Phillip and I shot at great speed up narrow, winding channels into a great, confusing labyrinth of backwaters. Here, on silent stretches, some dark and open, others covered with bright green water hyacinth, he showed me where long, joined strings of traps lay; only coloured ribbons attached to stumps and overhanging boughs indicated their presence. But eight, 10, 12ft below the surface, small claws were busy trying to pinch their way out of underwater prisons. In vain. That evening, in the Jungle Dinner Club at Ville Platte, I ordered a plate of crawfish. In the upmarket restaurants of New Orleans, crawfish tails are often served in a rich, roux-based bisque or etouffe, smothered in a butter-simmered stew of peppers, onions and garlic. Here, in Cajun country, true crawfish aficionados appreciate them simply boiled in vast numbers with salt and cayenne. Four pounds of crawfish - about 80 steaming crawdaddies - arrived on a tray and I began the long process of pulling off heads and peeling back shells. Tedious? Not a bit. There was no jambalaya, no file gumbo, and I was some distance from the closest bayou. But that did not matter. After just one bite of tail-meat, I knew I was going to have me some fun.</p>

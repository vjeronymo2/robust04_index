The aliens taken into custody were charged with having  counterfeit immigration documents.  </P> <P> "I find it encouraging that we found so few," said Hal Ezell, regional  commissioner of the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service. "In  recent years, we've found hundreds of illegals at California tracks. I think  this shows that our employer-sanction program is working."  </P></p>

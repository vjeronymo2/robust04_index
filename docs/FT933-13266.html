			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Heron sells properties to Postel for Pounds 62m HERON International, the property and trading group hoping to finalise a Pounds 1.4bn restructuring by the end of this month, has sold three properties to Postel Investment Management for Pounds 62m. The sale prices were above those assumed in Heron's business plan. Mr Gerald Ronson, who will give up the chairmanship of Heron when the restructuring goes through but will remain as chief executive, had told creditors last month that over Pounds 150m of sales had been completed or agreed in principle. These sales were included in that number. The three properties are a 12-unit retail warehouse park and two office blocks. Earlier this month Postel, the UK's largest pension fund, announced a Pounds 120m rescue package for Greycoat, the property group.</p>

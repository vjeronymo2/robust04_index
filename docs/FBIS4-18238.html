			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["uf."-signed report: "BMW Business Remains Energetic"] </F>   [Excerpts] Munich -- A balance sheet of success for Bernd  Pischetsrieder. During the term of office of the 45-year-old  head of BMW, who succeeded Eberhard von Kuenheim in May 1993,  the top position of the Munich corporation has been expanded  further.    "We are the only German automobile producers," BMW Financial  Director Volker Doppelfeld said, summarizing the past business  year, "that has avoided working short hours and still achieved  good operation results." This is a special economic development  in the crisis-torn automobile industry, which BMW head  Pischetsrieder wants to continue this year. "We expect slight  increases in production, sales, and yield," his cautious  prediction says. Even though the international deliveries of  BMW stagnated at 137,300 cars during the first quarter of 1994,  the turnover of the corporation rose by 2.7 percent to 7.5  billion German marks [DM] during the same period.    As a result of the acquisition of British automobile  producer  Rover, which was sealed a few weeks ago, the BMW corporation is  growing into new dimensions: The acquisition led to doubling of  the European market share to 6.4 percent. At the end of 1994,  the turnover of the BMW corporation, together with the  consolidated Rover group, will amount to at least DM40 billion.    The assessments of the British automobile producer (turnover  in 1993 was 4.3 billion pounds, sales were 442,000 vehicles),  which are linked with the consolidation, are in full swing at  the moment. "Rover is even better off than we originally  expected," Doppelfeld says about the results of his examination.  In addition, it is certain that the British BMW company, which  is operating independently, can contribute a positive result.  To expand its traditional position in the small-car sector  (Metro, Mini) and cross-country-vehicle sector (Range Rover),  BMW head Pischetsreder announced "increased investments" in the  improvement of the range of models.    With a total of 534,397 sold vehicles last year, the number  of deliveries to customers exceeded production (532,960 units),  which means that stocks were reduced. [passage omitted]    Despite the difficult economic situation or the strains  because of currency fluctuations, the BMW corporation shows a  yield of DM16 (726) million after taxes. [passage omitted]    In addition to material expenditures, it was also possible  to  reduce expenditures for personnel (the total number of employees  all over the world went down by 3.4 percent to 71,034).

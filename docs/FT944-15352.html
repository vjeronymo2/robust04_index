			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Major to insist IRA gives up its Semtex Mr John Major yesterday signalled that a readiness by the IRA to hand over its Semtex explosive and detonators will be one of the first tests applied by his government to the long-term intentions of the republican movement. As cabinet ministers prepared for a meeting which is expected to pave the way for a positive but limited response to the cessation of violence, Mr Major told MPs that the issue of the IRA's armaments would be 'crucial' to the process. But, answering questions in the Commons, he appeared to suggest that initially at least, the government was prepared to differentiate between guns and explosives. He said: 'The question of armaments, and especially Semtex and detonators perhaps more than guns, are crucial issues that will have to be dealt with.' Downing Street officials subsequently rejected any suggestion that he was signalling that the IRA might be able to keep its guns. But senior unionists have raised the possibility that the surrender of IRA weapons might be staggered, with explosives and heavy weapons handed in first as they could be used only in an offensive capacity. The republicans might say that they need initially to hold on to their guns in case of a resurgence of loyalist terrorism. Sir James Kilfedder, the Ulster Popular Unionist, told Mr Major yesterday that until the terrorists handed over their arms and Semtex explosives there was a danger of them being used by breakaway paramilitary groups. Mr Ken Maginnis, the Ulster Unionist MP said: 'It is the IRA's intention at active service unit level to recommence their violence in the month of January or as soon thereafter as they believe they can do so.' The unionists estimate the IRA still has about two tonnes of Semtex as well as more than 1,000 high-velocity rifles and a range of heavy machine guns and rocket launchers. Mr Major and senior cabinet ministers are expected to agree as early as tomorrow to respond formally to the IRA ceasefire by announcing that it is the government's 'working assumption' that the violence has ended for good. That could pave the way for informal contacts before Christmas with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, to discuss the terms under which it would be allowed to join talks on the province's future. But senior ministers privately acknowledge that the arms issue will be critical. Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, yesterday told the Dail, the Irish parliament, that peace negotiations could not be concluded until paramilitaries on both sides had handed over their arms. He said the government had made this point to Sinn Fein. Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, may hold a summit meeting this month to try to remove the obstacles that are still blocking the completion of a framework document to guide the talks process.</p>

			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Alcatel CIT chief freed The French Court of Appeal decided yesterday to free Mr Pierre Guichet, chairman of the telecommunications company Alcatel CIT, from jail after two weeks of imprisonment without charge. Mr Guichet, 62, was jailed on November 21 by investigating magistrate Judge Jean-Marie d'Huy, who is probing alleged overbilling of France Telecom for an amount estimated by French newspapers to be as much as FFr2bn (Pounds 238m). Mr Guichet and Alcatel have denied the allegations, saying the case arose from misunderstanding of the company's accounting practice.</p>

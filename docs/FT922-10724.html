			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / International Company News: PepsiCo gains on snack food performance A STRONG improvement in PepsiCo's snack food division in the first three months of 1992 offset weaker soft drinks earnings and allowed the company to report an 18 per cent increase in after-tax profits at Dollars 241.5m. Sales increased by 11 per cent to Dollars 4.58bn, and earnings per share were up by 15 per cent to 30 cents. PepsiCo saw a 10 per cent increase in soft drink sales, but operating profits in the division fell 3 per cent to Dollars 156.9m. The company said there had been a sharp fall in international profits, mainly because of a decline in bottling results. In the US, profits grew by 1 per cent, with the weaker growth rate explained by increased operating expenses and a 'difficult' comparison with 1991 because of a previous asset sale. Operating profits in the snack foods were 17 per cent higher at Dollars 205.1m, on a 6 per cent sales increase to Dollars 1.3bn.</p>

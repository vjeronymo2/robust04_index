			<p>BFN     [Text] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of Russia's Liberal  Democrats, cut short his visit to the French city of Strasbourg  today. Four days ago he arrived there as a member of a Russian  parliamentary delegation for a Council of Europe session. His  statement that Russia should retaliate for NATO air strikes on  Serb positions in Bosnia by attacking NATO bases in Italy  provoked a negative reaction from the French Foreign Ministry.  Apart from that, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy caused outrage by  getting involved in an incident with demonstrators protesting  against his visit to France.    As a result, the furious leader of Russia's Liberal  Democrats  vowed never to set foot on French soil again.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Question and answer session with Governor Christopher </F> Patten and members of the Legislative Council at the Legislative  Council Chamber in Hong Kong--live]    [Excerpts] [Andrew Wong, in Cantonese with simultaneous  translation into English] Mr. President, although yesterday I  voted against the motion moved by Mrs. Elsie Tu to delay our  consideration of the first part of the electoral arrangements  bill, it does not mean that I do not agree with the rationale  behind her move. I firmly believe that both China and Britain  should be sincere and open to reach an agreement through talks.  For this reasons, I hope that you, Mr. Governor, can respond to  several questions first, which perhaps have been answered in  your statement; that is: Are the Britain and Hong Kong side  still willing to talk with the Chinese side? [passage omitted]  If the Legislative Council and the future legislature can have  most seats returned through elections and abide by the principle  of being fair and open, then can you not consider adopting a  proportional representation [PR] voting system? Thank you.    [Governor Patten] The honorable member raised a number of  issues. Some of them are a little complicated. But let me try  to respond as clearly as possible. First, on willingness to  talk. In, I hope, as factual and unprovocative a way as  possible, let me remind the council that we proposed talks in  October 1992, that we went on saying that we wanted to talk for  the next six or seven months while we were not, frankly, getting  a very warm response from Chinese officials. We were pleased  when talks eventually got underway in April 1993, only sorry  that they had taken so long to get underway. We would have liked  to go on talking even after time had pressed us to put in the  second of the three bills which the Legislative Council is going  to have to consider. But, alas, Chinese officials insisted that  we withdraw the second bill, the partial legislation that was  passed yesterday, before they were prepared to come to the  table. Our door is never closed, and we want to talk on a whole  range of issues and talk constructively and creatively. We  would like to see more constructive and creative talks in the  Joint Liaison Group. We would like to see an early meeting of  the Airport Committee to resolve an issue, which I think the  whole community thinks has dragged on too long. So, as far as  we are concerned, cooperation remains something on which we are  particularly keen. But, I do have to point out that we had 17  rounds of talks, and I think when honorable members, including  the distinguished honorable member who has just spoken, see the  account of those 17 rounds of talks in the White Paper, they  will be surprised how much time was spent discussing so little  agreement. [passage omitted]    This council has voted pretty decisively now on at least a  couple of occasions on the question of the voting method for  geographical constituencies, and I think the arguments for  proportionality, if I may say so, are somewhat lessened when you  would seek to achieve proportionality, or you seek to achieve  balance by having three different sorts of electoral process.  If every member of this Legislative Council was to be elected  directly -- as some honorable members would like, as I am sure  some honorable members will press for during the debates that  lie ahead -- if every member was directly elected, then I think  the argument for a proportional voting system would be that much  stronger. But since we had tried to achieved balance through  the functional constituencies, through the election committee, I  think the arguments for PR are much less considerable. And so,  I notice, does the Legislative Council. If the honorable member  was able with his powers of eloquence to persuade his colleagues  differently, then it would require, of course, overturning  several votes which the Legislative Council has already taken.  I hope I have responded in some detail to the honorable  member's question.    [Ha Wing-ho, in Cantonese with simultaneous translation into  English] Mr. Governor, after the release of the White Paper, if  we read the White Paper and feel that the British side should  score a higher mark, it does not help us to solve the question;  that is, in 1995, there may be a new Legislative Council, but by  1997, all the Legislative Councillors returned in 1995 may have  to climb down the tree. Mr. Governor, can you solve this  problem for us?    [Patten] I cannot solve unilaterally the question of how we  secure a through train. I think that the council will see from  the White Paper that unfortunately we were not able to secure  Chinese agreement to a through train during 17 rounds of talks,  though we tried, I think imaginatively and sensibly to do so,  with the proposals we put about oaths and about other matters.  But let me just deal briefly with the question of what happens  in 1997. I choose my words carefully, they do not in any way  reflect on Chinese sovereignty, they do not in any way change  the historic fact of 30 June and 1 July 1997, but I do not  believe there is any reason -- I stress that word -- I do not  believe there is any reason why China should seek to overturn  arrangements in 1997 which are entirely in compliance with the  Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. The assertion that they  are not has been made on a number of occasions, but the  assertion has been made more frequently than any evidence has  ever been adduced. It goes on being said, but nobody ever  demonstrates how it happens to be the case. And I say one other  thing as well, using, since I noticed that metaphors were from  the beginning of the debate yesterday in much evidence in the  chamber, using a metaphor to make the point: If my next-door  neighbor says that in three and a half years he is going to come  round to my house and break all the windows, that does not seem  to me to be a very persuasive argument for me breaking all the  windows this afternoon.    [Mrs. Elsie Tu] Thank you, Mr. President. Mr President,  may I ask the governor, through you, something that has been  puzzling me for a long time. The proposed political package is  always referred to as being democratic. Can the governor  explain to me how it is democratic to give two votes to every  person who works in a workplace, but only one person, one vote  to those who work in other places, such as housewives, or  elderly persons retired, and adult students? I find it very  difficult to understand how it is democratic. It means that the  ones who are not working in a workplace are only half a person.    [Patten] Well, I am sure the honorable lady, whose vigorous  eloquence I salute as the Legislative Council has, I am sure  that the honorable lady would not want me to take that argument  to its conclusion, because the conclusion of the argument is  that the proposals that are being put forward in the bill that  will be published tomorrow are a great deal more democratic than  the present system. Under the present system -- and perhaps the  honorable lady wishes to argue the case against functional  constituencies, perhaps that is her argument -- under the  present system, only a few people have two votes because of  functional constituencies and geographical constituencies. Of  course, some have a lot more than two votes. Some, because of  corporate voting in constituencies have -- oh -- votes into  double figure, and that is a situation that we are anxious to  eliminate with the introduction of individual rather than  corporate voting. It is perfectly true that because not  everyone is at work the extension of votes as we have proposed  in the nine new functional constituencies does not mean that  everyone in the community has two votes, but that is because of  the nature of functional constituencies, and I would not want to  challenge the Basic Law in having the number of functional  constituencies of 30, which are proposed for 1995 through to  1999. [passage omitted]    [Elsie Tu] I think the present system is quite right, the  present system does give two votes to some people, and I  disagree with that. I think people should have a choice, but to  make it work does not seem any more democratic. Is it not less  democratic to give more people two votes?    [Patten] I think it is an argument which few would accept  that extending the ability to vote is less democratic than  limiting the ability to vote. I really cannot follow the  argument that by ensuring more people are able to vote in  functional constituencies, one is going down a less democratic  path. That seems to me to be a considerable contradiction in  terms, but if the honorable lady is arguing the case in  principle against functional constituencies, which she may well  be, all I can say is that we are committed to trying to  introduce arrangements which are in compliance with the Basic  Law, and the Basic Law proposes 30 functional constituencies.  The question is whether those functional constituencies, for  example, in line with the 1988 White Paper, represent economic  and professional sectors of substantial importance, and the  question, secondly, is whether, following I think it is Basic  Law 68, pursuing matters in an orderly way, whether we try to  deal with some of the real problems which have arisen in  functional constituencies in the last few years. Honorable  members are well aware of some of the problems that have arisen  in those functional constituencies. They may disagree with the  proposals that we have brought forward in trying to deal with  them, in which case they will be able to debate this in this  Legislative Council. It is very, very difficult to devise nine  new functional constituencies, and I think that some of the  inherent difficulties will be demonstrated to all those  honorable members who read the White Paper and the account of  our negotiations with our Chinese colleagues on this point.    [Reverend Fung Chi-woo, in Cantonese with simultaneous  translation into English] [Passage omitted] Will the governor  lobby the councillors to accept your proposals to make sure they  will go through smoothly. What will you do?    [Patten] We will do what we did in the run-up to yesterday's  debate. Argue our case with all that gentle eloquence for which  members of the Hong Kong government are renowned. We do not  have any of the instruments which are perhaps available  elsewhere in other communities. We recognize that this council  has to make decisions, and that this council has 60  independent-minded members who are not going to be pushed around  by a government, and I hope are not going to be pushed around by  anybody else in Hong Kong or outside Hong Kong. So we will  argue our case, but if by lobbying you mean making threats, if  by lobbying the honorable member means seeking, of course  metaphorically, to break arms and legs, that is not our way. We  put these proposals forward in good faith. We will argue the  case for them and hope that they provide an acceptable basis for  the electoral arrangements in Hong Kong. I have to say if I  look back to yesterday, we were told at the beginning of the  week that we would just scrape through with our bill yesterday.  Well it proved to be, I am pleased to say, rather better than  that. And I would like to add one point about it. I think it  was an extremely important day for Hong Kong. I think it was an  extremely important mature moment in Hong Kong's history.  Nobody can wipe it out. Nobody can pretend it did not happen.  Nobody can turn the clock back on what happened. Not just the  particular decisions about electoral arrangements that were  made, but the whole process: what was actually happening in this  chamber. And happening with considerable maturity, with of  course, a lot of polite vigor, but happening I am sure in the  case of every honorable member, happening in a way in which  honorable members hoped would secure the best interests of the  people of Hong Kong. And it is entirely right that this  Legislative Council should be involved in the process in the way  it was yesterday.    [Mr. Howard Young] Mr. Governor, the gazetting and tabling  of the 1992 version of the second-stage reforms is, as you  described, without an agreement with China. However, on the  other hand, British Government says that it is willing to  continue negotiations. Although slim as they are the chances of  such happening, has it gone beyond the stage yet where, during  the legislative process, should there be agreement reached in  one form or another with China -- not necessarily in  negotiations, agreements can even be reached by diplomatic  letters of exchange -- if during that process has it gone beyond  the stage where the government might even bring up amendments to  what is being gazetted tomorrow to conform with any such  agreement that could be reached before the legislative process  has ended?    [Patten] I repeat, in a way, what I said earlier, that our  door has never been closed, and will never be closed. And if,  in the course of the next few months, we thought there was the  chance of an agreed way forward with China, which was also  acceptable and which secured the objectives which I think the  community has, then we would of course have to present that to  the council, even if it meant amending what was already being  considered by the council. That is, I hope, an earnest of our  sincerity. But again, I say, time does close in. It is not  because we wish it were that way, it is part of the ineluctable  movement of the calendar, and the elections that we have got,  are, for reasons which the whole council knows are extremely  complicated, and do involve complicated arrangements. But I  repeat, it has never been our position that we declined to have  talks.    [Christine Loh] Thank you, Mr. President. I welcome the  release of the 17 rounds of talks by both the British and the  Chinese Government. It will at least give the people of Hong  Kong a change to protest against compromises made in their name.  What I would like to ask is: Traditionally, the British  Government's position has always been that these are diplomatic  issues and they should be kept confidential, but now that since  both governments are going to release the information, is that  not really now a signal of the end of Sino-British negotiations  over electoral reform. And also my second question is: If we  were to pass these legislations -- and I certainly hope that we  will pass them before July -- there is no opportunity really to  ever return to discuss these issues with China, is that correct?    [Patten] Well, it is perfectly correct that we would not  have taken this step, which as the honorable member says has  already been taken by, in a way, by Chinese officials, if we  thought there was a rosy prospect of keeping negotiations going.  But I am an experienced enough politician never to say never.  There may be a prospect down the road of reviving some sort of,  within time, some sort of dialogue on electoral matters. The  whole community, I am sure, hopes that's possible. At the same  time, my reading of the community is that they would like to get  this debate over and done with and out of the way, and get on  with other matters. [passage omitted]    [Jimmy McGregor] Governor, it is my impression that the two  proposals yet to come before us in the form of legislation are  the two critical proposals in your packages of seven or eight  proposals, which you started with. It is also my impression  that one of these proposals may undergo very considerable change  in discussion in this council. If that proves to be the case,  and remembering that the British Government has already  compromised both of these proposals to some extent by entering  into negotiations and modifying the proposals to become somewhat  less democratic as far as we can make out, will you be able to  accept, in good faith, the modification of at least one of these  two major proposals, and the possible modification of the other  to some extent, and accept that in good faith this council would  reach that conclusion and that you will be able to bring  legislation in to give effect to these changes which, this  council in its wisdom, requests?    [Patten] [Passage omitted] We are not simply going to come  down to the Legislative Council, put the bill on the table, and  then scarper. That is not our intention, and it would not be  honorable to behave in that way. But the Legislative Council  has an important function. The Legislative Council has to  consider legislation, and if necessary, the Legislative Council  has the power to amend legislation. That is true today, and it  will be true, according to the Basic Law, after 1997. So, if  the Legislative Council changed the proposals which are put to  them, then at the end of the day that is a reality which we have  to accept. I would just add this one point. That I would be  put in a difficult position, the government would be put in a  difficult position, the British Government would be put in a  difficult position, if the Legislative Council appeared to have  agreed with arrangements which were not fair and which were not  open and which did not seem to be acceptable to the community.  But I don't think that is a remotely likely possibility, since I  think the community's views are extremely well-represented in  this council. Though, in good faith, if the Legislative Council  changed the proposals, the government would accept them.    [Martin Barrow] Governor, you mentioned earlier other  issues on the agenda for discussion with China. Could you  comment on the government's strategy for discussing economic  issues, such as the airport?    [Patten] Yes. Our strategy is to press as courteously and  constructively for a dialogue on these matters as possible.  There are discussions going on this week, as I think the  council knows on the difficult but important issue of the future  of defense lands. That has an economic aspect as well as other  aspects as well. We would like to have the opportunity of  discussing with Chinese officials, sooner rather than later, the  proposals that we have put, the fourth set of proposals that we  have put, on financing the airport. There are a lot of other  proposals touching on Hong Kong's economic well being that we  would like to carry forward. I was encouraged by what the  Chinese prime minister said last December about Chinese  officials being determined not to let any political argument  affect the livelihood of Hong Kong and to continue to work for  the interests of Hong Kong. So I hope that we can see a  dialogue develop rather more constructively than perhaps as  happened not just for the last 18 months, but for the last three  years. In the meantime, we continue with the support from time  to time, when expenditure decisions are necessary, we continue  to do what we believe is in the long-term interests of Hong  Kong. That has been, so far I am pleased to say, a beneficial  process. And the latest round of those benefits will be made  public when the financial secretary announces his budget next  week.    [Emily Lau] I want to ask the Governor a question about  electoral arrangements which may be in breach of the Basic Law,  because earlier this afternoon he kept talking about putting in  place arrangements which are in line with the Basic Law. But of  course, when we saw the foreign secretary last year, he said the  importance is that they are in line with Britain's international  obligations. As the Governor rightly pointed out just then,  certain people, including myself, will be moving an amendment  for 60 seats in the council to be directly elected in 1995, and  that I guess the governor would say, is not in line with the  provisions of the Basic Law. Mr. President, I want to ask the  governor, what will he and the British Government do then? If  it is blatantly in breach of the Basic Law, will the British  administration move to block it or will you still say that it is  line with the Joint Declaration, also in line with Britain's  international obligations, so you would support it. Thank you.    [Patten] Well, I am of course an unqualified and unabashed  admirer of the honorable lady's political and rhetorical  talents. But I think I would like to see her majority before I  answer the question. I know that the honorable lady has an  unshakable and wholly honorable commitment to a totally  democratic system in Hong Kong well before 2007, and preferably  next week. I respect the honorable lady's courage in arguing  for that and consistency in arguing for that. But I do not  honestly think that the honorable lady is going to be....  [changes thought] she may prove me wrong, she has proved British  politicians wrong on occasions in the past and asked difficult  questions of British politicians. I do not think the honorable  lady is likely to secure the outcome in the next few months  which she understandably and honorably has said. If she does, I  will answer the question.    [Emily Lau] The governor has not answered my question. My  question is whether he will block it? If he blocks it, then it  cannot even be introduced. If it is given a chance, maybe it  will be defeated by my colleagues, maybe it will be carried. If  it is not even allowed to be introduced, how can I prove to you?    [Patten] Nobody, I will keep my decibel count down, nobody  is actually saying the honorable lady cannot introduce her  argument and her ideas. It would be an extremely brave woman,  an even braver man, who ever tried to stop the honorable lady  developing a political argument. The political argument she has  got is one which many people in this community and outside the  community would regard as wholly reasonable. But I do not think  that it is ever sensible to answer very hypothetical questions  in the way that the honorable lady is inviting me to. I answer  sometimes partially hypothetical questions, but the more  hypothetical they are, the less sensible I think it is to answer  them. And just to add one point, I think that it is a strength  of our proposals, the government's proposals, that they are not  only in line with the Joint Declaration but also wholly in line  with the Basic Law. And I think that it is a matter of strength  as well, that despite the rain forests that have been cut down  over the last year and a half to try to demonstrate that we have  violated the Basic Law and the Joint Declaration, no evidence  which convinces anybody has ever been adduced for that. I do  not think that we would be in a stronger position if we had put  forward proposals such as the honorable lady advances, which go  against the Basic Law. What we are trying to do is build as  broad a base of support in the community as possible. But  somebody with my background could not help but admire the  objectives which the honorable lady has set herself and for  which she has argued with, as I said, such consistency and  passion often to the embarrassment of politicians from Britain  and elsewhere.</p>

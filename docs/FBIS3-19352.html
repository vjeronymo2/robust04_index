			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vittoria Sivo: "Italy, A Vote for Employment"] </F>   [Text] Never have the various party programs focused on the  term "employment" as in this election campaign. Over the last  few months, we have witnessed an alarmism about the number of  jobs lost or "in jeopardy," whereas over the last few weeks lots  of figures have been provided on how many jobs could be created  through measures that need to be adopted in all sectors.    They range from flexibility in the job market to a policy of  rigorous containment of public expenditure, from salary  restraints to the use of taxes.    Most of the cures cannot be compared, above all because they  refer to different timeframes (two, three, five years) within  which the objective of creating new jobs should be attained.  <H5>  The Government Plan </H5>   According to the white paper drafted by Labor Minister Gino  Giugni, "it is possible to put forward as an hypothesis, for the  1994-99 five year plan, the objective of an average 3 percent  annual GDP growth rate. In this way 125,000 jobs would be  created per year," an increase of 625,000 jobs over five years.  However, the Labor Ministry sees this measure as totally  insufficient to guarantee the European employment level  convergence criteria. Thus, we need to adopt a medium-term  strategy which aims at a 3 percent GDP increase, a development  of human resources (raise compulsory school attendance to the  age of 16, double the number of workers with a high-school  diploma), an increase of "standardized flexibility" of working  relations, and promotion of part-time work. This is to be based  upon the commitments made by the government and the social  partners in the July 1993 agreement.  <H5>  Luigi Spaventa's Recipe </H5>   Budget Minister Spaventa, who is now election candidate on  the Progressives' list, has focused on resuming public  investments. In case 30 trillion lire is made available for  public investments over three years, he claims that 300,000 jobs  will be created. However, economic growth is only expected to  be 1 percent a year, not enough to reactivate the job market.  There is a need for greater flexibility, and forms of "gray  work" substituting for "black work." Spaventa also proposes a  substantive reduction in company contributions, which needs to  be balanced by an "ecological tax," among other things.  <H5>  Confindustria's Forecasts </H5>   In December 1993, the employers' federation had calculated  that if 200 projects were to be released immediately (blocked  thus far by bureaucracy) 60,000 people would get a job. As for  the economy in general, Confindustria [General Confederation of  Italian Industry] has put forward two opposing scenarios for the  1994-96 timeframe: the forecasts based upon the Ciampi  government's policy, and those based upon a stricter control of  inflation and public expenditures. In terms of employment, the  differences in absolute figures deriving from the second  scenario compared to the first are 55,000 more in 1994, 140,000  more in 1995, and 197,000 in 1996. These increases in the  number of jobs would result from a considerable shifting of  public expenditures from consumption to investments and from the  complete elimination of health care contributions for labor,  which would be financed through indirect taxes. In this case,  inflation would be lower because the effect of indirect tax  increases would be more than compensated for by a decrease in  labor costs and an increase of productivity.  <H5>  Berlusconi's Promises </H5>   The provision in Forza Italia's program to create 1 million  jobs is based upon a series of propositions: lower taxes on new  hires by reducing the fiscal and social security burden on labor  costs, and to experiment in areas with high unemployment with  "complete tax exemptions" for three years, with social security  reductions for all activities aimed at creating jobs.  Apprenticeships, professional training, and greater flexibility  in the standards of the job market are other measures to which  Berlusconi's job plan appeals.</p>

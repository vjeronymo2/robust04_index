			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Spotting losers THE CURSE of British industry, it would appear, is complacency. According to an IBM study published earlier this week, the great majority of British manufacturers believe themselves to be internationally competitive. In fact, only a tiny proportion of their plants operate to the highest world standards. The issue of competitiveness has preoccupied the Department of Trade and Industry and the Confederation of British Industry for the past year and more. Assuming the IBM picture is broadly correct - and there is anecdotal evidence to support it - why have these august bodies not made the fact known? The answer is sadly obvious. The DTI has prepared an analysis of Britain's competitive position. But the results are uncomfortable, and thus cannot be published. Similarly, the CBI's National Manufacturing Council has devoted itself, since its inception 18 months ago, to identifying areas of weakness and inculcating best practice. But the CBI's main job is to represent British industry to the outside world. It cannot be expected to publish a blunt picture of industry's failings. IBM's position is very different. Its survey is a first stab at entering the management consultancy market, and by publishing its results it hopes to drum up custom. That does not invalidate the findings. Though the study is not exhaustive, its methodology seems objective enough: to assess some 200 plants on an index of performance, based on an analysis of best manufacturing practice in the US and Japan. Subsequent examination suggests that plants at the top of the sample had profit margins some 10 percentage points higher than those at the bottom. The study's definition of 'world class' - a score of over 80 per cent on the index - is arbitrary. But there seems no reason to doubt the conclusion that Britain is lagging badly behind. Such findings are depressing only if they are not acted upon. The study suggests, for example, that one of the strongest influences on manufacturing performance is the quality of the customer. The food manufacturing industry scores high, because of the standards imposed by retailers such as Sainsbury and Tesco. So do suppliers to the computer industry. Suppliers to government departments score below average. This lends force to a familiar notion: that one of the most basic objectives of industrial policy should be for the government to be a professional buyer. Another conclusion for government is similarly basic. The complacency of British industry may often be a case of honest ignorance. As the CBI itself has been heard to remark, there are too many companies in Britain believing themselves to be Olympic class when their true standard is that of the village green. Pointing out the discrepancy, however brusquely, is a necessary preliminary to setting it right. If the DTI has the information, it should publish it as widely as possible.</p>

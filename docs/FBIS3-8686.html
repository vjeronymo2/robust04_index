			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] One of the participants in the conference--which has  been prepared under the auspices of the State Chamber by both  Slovene universities --was Dr. Willem van Eekelen, secretary  general of the West European Union [WEU]. In his speech  yesterday he warned that civilian supervision over military  decisions is one of the fundamental principles in providing  security in democratic states.    In a brief interview to our reporter Tomaz Gerden, Mr. van  Eekelen also assessed Slovenia's prospects in the European  integrations:    [Begin recording] [Gerden] We asked Dr. van Eekelen about  Slovenia's prospects for cooperation and integration into the  Partnership for Peace, the WEU, and NATO:    [Eekelen, in English with superimposed Slovene translation]  I think that it is important for Slovenia to make progress in  all different directions. First in the Council of Europe, whose  member you already are, and then in NATO's Partnership for  Peace, which will be important for the cooperation of your army  with the Western armies. In this way your armed forces will  adopt Western standards in military budget, arms, organization,  and civilian supervision over military policy. However, I do  not believe that you or others will shortly become NATO members.  There will be quite some time needed for this.    [Gerden] Dr. van Eekelen also added that cooperation with  the European Union [EU] is of extreme importance for Slovenia,  as it means stability for our state in various aspects. As soon  as Slovenia signs the association agreement with the EU it will  also be admitted into the WEU Consultative Council, and this  cooperation will widen further later.    Dr. van Eekelen also stressed that the WEU in no way views  Slovenia within the framework of the former Yugoslavia but  treats it as an independent European country. [end recording]</p>

			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Preparing the case for the prosecution: Robert Rice opens the files on Barbara Mills, the new DPP WHILE Mrs Barbara Mills' brief reign at the Serious Fraud Office's Elm Street headquarters was not the nightmare of the film title it was no bed of roses either. She leaves the fledgling SFO facing the prospect of finding its third head in its 3 1/2 -year history and at a time when observers are increasingly asking when it is going to live up to early promises of a fast and efficient system for tackling white-collar crime. Mrs Mills arrived at the SFO in September 1990 in time to bask in the glory of the successful first Guinness prosecution in which she appeared as second Crown prosecutor - the SFO's only significant success to date. She leaves in time to escape the worst of the criticism which is building up about the handling of the Blue Arrow case. She comes to the DPP's job at a time when the criminal justice system is under the spotlight following a series of celebrated miscarriages of justice. Much of the attention of the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice, set up after the release of the Birmingham Six, will focus on the role of the Crown Prosecution Service, and she will have a pivotal part to play in shaping its future direction. Having successfully juggled a career at the Bar with bringing up four children, the job of DPP is one that colleagues say she is more than capable of. Both the Law Society and the Bar welcomed her appointment yesterday. The Bar said she had 'the right balance of experience between prosecuting and defending to make a good successor to Sir Allan Green. Privately, however, colleagues are less complimentary. One QC said: 'It's generally felt she didn't distinguish herself in either the Guinness prosecution or her defence of Winston Silcott in the PC Blakelock murder trial, and apart from that her career at the Bar consisted mainly of run-of-the-mill trials at the Old Bailey.' She has a reputation for hard work and good judgment. Aged 51, she was called to the Bar in 1963, became a Crown Court Recorder in 1982 and QC in 1986. Mrs Mills' successor at the SFO will be left to pick up some of the biggest and most difficult fraud investigations ever undertaken. He will inherit the unenviable task of trying to carry the Polly Peck, BCCI and Maxwell cases forward to a successful conclusion under the increasingly hostile gaze of a public growing sceptical about the SFO's ability to deliver the goods. There is little doubt that the SFO's task has grown more difficult over the past 18 months. Its conviction rate last year was just 63 per cent, compared with the 90 per cent rate historically produced by the Metropolitan and City Fraud Squad. Its caseload is still the same as when Mrs Mills took over from Mr John Wood, the SFO's first director, but the amount involved in the frauds under investigation has soared from Pounds 1.3bn to Pounds 4.5bn. It stands accused of taking a cavalier attitude to civil liberties and in particular of riding roughshod over the suspect's long-established privilege against self-incrimination as justification for refusing to answer investigators' questions. The SFO's controversial power to compel people to answer questions under section 2 of the 1987 Criminal Justice Act is being challenged in the Appeal Court. There have been some high points during her tenure. The handling of the Barlow Clowes case is generally thought to have been a success. But there have also been some noticeable failures, among them the collapse of the trial of four men accused of a Pounds 60m fraud against Hill Samuel, the merchant bank, and the failure of the DPR Futures and Marconi cases. The arrest last October of an investigator who was working with the SFO on the BCCI inquiry was an embarrassment which she could have done without. Her appointment as DPP is likely to raise again questions about her husband's business career. He was sacked in 1987 as deputy chairman of the London Docklands Development Corporation after two companies he had connnections with collapsed with debts of more than Pounds 600,000 and one was convicted under trading standards law. Legitimately, she may argue that this was considered irrelevant to her appointment as SFO director and so should be irrelevant to her ability to carry out her new role.</p>

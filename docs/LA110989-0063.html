			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECIPES THAT TAKE YOU BACK TO SCHOOL DAYS  </P> <P> Just about every year at this time, nostalgia over foods eaten in school  cafeterias years ago rears a maudlin head.  </P> <P> How good or bad those school day foods actually were matters not. It's how well  remembered, adored and revered they are today that counts.  </P> <P> Judy Gilges of Long Beach writes: "In the cafeteria in the early '60s, they  used to make a tuna sandwich and a killer peanut butter cookie. . . ."  </P> <P> Ellen Vakovich remembers a crumb cake sold during nutrition break. "It's been a  very long time since I've eaten that great cake," she writes.  </P> <P> So we're back digging in our files for those long-lost recipes for cookies,  pizzas, cinnamon rolls.  </P> <P> Experience throughout the years has told us that sweets are remembered most  fondly and most frequently. Ranger Cookies (also known as Flying Saucers), the  most frequently requested school recipe, was formulated for home use by a  cereal manufacturer in 1952, according to school officials interviewed some  years ago. Back then the Los Angeles City Unified School District food service  director was Helen Crane, who adapted the recipe that has been a favorite  since.  </P> <P> Today, an oversized chocolate chip cookie and a plain, moist and dense crumb  cake, the standard breakfast item today, are considered the most popular sweets  on the a la carte menu, according to Anita King, now head of nutrition services  for the Los Angeles City Unified School District.  </P> <P> Today, too, attitudes toward sweets have dramatically altered school menus,  particularly the dessert menu.  </P> <P> School district nutritionists have markedly curbed dessert offerings in the  School Lunch Program in an effort to conform to the U.S. Dietary Guidelines to  reduce fats and sugars in the diet. Today, school lunch rooms are serving  occasional cookies such as apple-oatmeal, ice milk and fruit juice bars along  with fresh fruit.  </P> <P> "We've gotten away from serving desserts almost entirely in the last seven or  eight years. We try to encourage fresh fruit for school lunches," said King.  </P> <P> Sugary goodies, however, have been available on an a la carte basis all along.  </P> <P> Among them is Devil's Food Cake, which was introduced in 1939 to the Los  Angeles City Schools by Frances Johnson, when she was a manager at one of the  schools. Today, the recipe for the dark, moist cake derives its red coloring  from baking soda, not the red food dye used in the past. "The cake is  especially good when frosted with Seven Minute Frosting, and dribbled with  melted chocolate," suggested King. And there are readers who have reminded us  how wonderful that gooey cake was -- and is.  </P> <P> Sour Cream Coffeecake, a version of the breakfast coffee crumb cake requested  by Vakovich, has been part of the school cafeteria repertoire since 1959 and is  still served at special school functions.  </P> <P> A peanut crunch, still requested by readers, was served in the Glendale Unified  School District for years and was one of the all-time favorites of that school  district.  </P> <P> Among the favorite entrees most requested throughout the years has been pizza,  which made its debut in 1957 in the Long Beach Unified School District. Today,  according to King, pizza is numero uno, along with tacos and hamburgers.  </P> <P> There was a time, however, when the best-remembered entrees were such school  favorites as chopped beef and gravy over mashed potatoes and roast beef hash,  no longer served in schools. Readers, however, still request the recipes. And  we still print them.  </P> <P> Here they are, along with other old and new recipes from school cafeterias that  will no doubt be passed on through the years to come, like heirlooms:  </P> <P> SCHOOL HOUSE CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES  </P> <P> 1 cup butter, softened  </P> <P> 1 cup brown sugar, packed  </P> <P> 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar  </P> <P> 2 eggs, lightly beaten  </P> <P> 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla  </P> <P> 3 cups flour  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda  </P> <P> 1 (12-ounce) package semisweet chocolate pieces  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups coarsely chopped walnuts  </P> <P> Beat butter, brown sugar and granulated sugar until light and creamy.

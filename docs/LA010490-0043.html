			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: LEGAL FILE  </P> <P> Settlement in CBS Suit: A federal judge approved Wednesday a $6-million  settlement of a lawsuit filed by a CBS shareholder who claimed the network was  mismanaged from 1983 to 1986. The lawsuit was brought in 1986 by Roger Minkoff,  a real estate investor from the Virgin Islands who owns 12 CBS shares.  </P> <P> The Nov. 28 settlement, in which the management of CBS Inc. admits no  wrongdoing, will be paid by a network insurance policy. The settlement money,  totaling $4.5 million, will go to the CBS treasury for an indirect benefit to  shareholders. Minkoff's attorney will receive the remaining $1.5 million, with  $15,000 of that going directly to Minkoff. Among the allegations in the suit  were that CBS wasted corporate assets when it bought part of the Ziff-Davis  Publishing Co. in 1985 for $362.5 million and that it was hurt by efforts to  fend off a takeover attempt by Ted Turner in 1985.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ``Marine Chemist'' means an individual who possesses a current Marine Chemist Certificate issued by the National Fire Protection Association. This definition is substantially the same as the one in the proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the NPRM, OSHA requested comments related to the definition of ``Marine Chemist''. Although some comments were received on this subject, they all related to the issue of whether or not anyone else could perform the duties required of a Marine Chemist. These comments are discussed under the summary and explanation of &sect;&sect;1915.12(c)(3) and 1915.14(a)(1), later in this preamble.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Nationally Recognized Testing laboratory'' (NRTL) means a laboratory recognized by OSHA as meeting the provisions of Appendix A of &sect;1910.7. In the previous standard, OSHA referred to ``Underwriters Laboratories'' as one of the organizations that could approve lamps for use in Class I, Group D atmospheres. Since OSHA has promulgated the NRTL standard, laboratories meeting that standard are the appropriate organizations to approve such lamps.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Not Safe for Hot Work'' denotes a space where hot work may not be performed. This definition is substantially the same as the one in the proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Not Safe for Workers'' denotes a space that employees may not enter. The proposed definition of ``Not Safe for Workers'' contained criteria to be used to determine whether or not a space was safe for entry. OSHA has not carried these criteria forward into the definition of this term in the final rule. The same criteria also appeared under the proposed definition of ``Safe for Workers''. OSHA believes that removing the redundancy will help clarify revised Subpart B. (See the summary and explanation of the definition of ``Enter with Restrictions'', earlier in this preamble, for additional discussion of issues regarding the use of the term ``Not Safe for Workers''.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Oxygen-deficient atmosphere'' means an atmosphere having an oxygen concentration of less than 19.5 percent by volume. ``Oxygen-enriched atmosphere'' means an atmosphere that contains 22.0 percent or more oxygen by volume. These two definitions have been carried forward from the proposal without substantive change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Safe for Hot Work'' denotes a space that meets the following criteria:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The atmosphere is not oxygen-enriched;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The concentration of flammable vapors in the atmosphere is less than 10 percent of the LEL;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Residues or materials within the space, under existing atmospheric conditions in the presence of hot work and while maintained as directed by the Marine Chemist or competent person, are not capable of producing a higher concentration of oxygen or flammable vapors than permitted under the first two criteria; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) All adjacent spaces have been cleaned or inerted or otherwise treated sufficiently to prevent the spread of fire.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition in the final rule is substantively the same as the corresponding definition in the proposal; however, the language has been improved for clarity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Safe for Workers'' denotes a space that meets the following criteria:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The atmosphere is neither oxygen-deficient nor oxygen- enriched;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The concentration of flammable vapors is below 10 percent of the LEL;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Any toxic materials associated with cargo, fuel, tank coatings, inerting mediums, or fumigants are within permissible concentrations at the time of inspection; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Residues or materials associated with the work authorized by the Marine Chemist, Certified Industrial Hygienist, or competent person will not produce uncontrolled toxic materials under existing atmospheric conditions while maintained as directed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition in the final rule is substantively the same as the corresponding definition in the proposal, except that the language has been improved for clarity and the ``exception'' in the proposal regarding the concentration of flammable vapors has not been carried forward. OSHA believes that this exception, which is recognized in &sect;1915.13(b)(6) in the final rule, more properly falls under the new term ``Enter with Restrictions''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Space'' means an area on a vessel, vessel section or within a shipyard such as, but not limited to, a cargo tank or hold, pump or engine room, storage locker, tank containing flammable or combustible liquids, gases, or solids; a room within a building, crawl space, tunnel, and accessway. Although no definition of this word was proposed, its meaning is essential to the content of revised Subpart B. The final rule uses the word ``space'' broadly to encompass all the different types of areas in a shipyard where dangerous atmospheres might be found. The definition of this word in the final rule is intended to convey this meaning to employers and employees who must comply with the standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Upper explosive limit'' (UEL) means the maximum concentration of flammable vapor above which propagation of flame does not occur on contact with a source of ignition. This definition is unchanged from the proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Vessel section'' means a subassembly, module, or other component of a vessel being built, repaired, or broken. This definition is unchanged from the proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Visual inspection'' means the physical survey of the space, surroundings and contents by the competent person, Marine Chemist, or Certified Industrial Hygienist to identify hazards such as, but not limited to, restricted accessibility, residues, unguarded machinery, and piping or electrical systems that could create or enhance hazards. This term is defined in the final rule to clarify what is required of the person preforming the inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA has not carried forward into the final rule the proposed definition of ``weather deck''. The Agency believes that a definition of this term is not necessary to the meaning of the standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARYLAND'S DEFENSE WILL GET TESTED  </P> <P> Louisiana Tech has been back in Division I football for only two seasons, but  that is enough time for Maryland Coach Joe Krivak to know about the potent  offense his Terrapins will face in today's Independence Bowl.  </P> <P> "Tech has great balance on offense and people who can execute it," Krivak said.  </P> <P> "They are explosive and are two-deep at tailback."  </P> <P> The Bulldogs (8-3) are ranked 10th in the nation with 450 yards total offense  per game -- 212 rushing and 238 passing. Two of their running backs -- Michael  Richardson and Jason Davis -- have combined for 2,043 rushing yards.  </P> <P> Richardson has 1,114 yards rushing and 13 touchdowns, and Davis has 929 yards  and eight touchdowns.  </P> <P> But the Bulldogs also have been able to throw the ball. Quarterback Gene  Johnson has completed 165 of 297 passes for 2,129 yards and 13 touchdowns.  </P> <P> Maryland (6-5) gets 73% of its offense from a passing game directed by Scott  Zolak (225 of 418 for 2,589 yards and 10 touchdowns). Zolak has led the  Terrapins to their first winning record since 1985 against a schedule that  included six Top 25 opponents.  </P> <P> Louisiana Tech has a five-game winning streak.  </P></p>

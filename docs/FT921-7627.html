			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / International Company News: Fokus Bank's deficit doubled FOKUS BANK, Norway's third biggest commercial bank, yesterday revealed a 1991 net loss almost doubled to NKr2.1bn (Dollars 325.6m), from NKr1.15bn a year earlier, and said credit losses in 1992 would remain high. Fokus was formally taken over by the state in December after making huge interim losses. The state became the bank's owner after a NKr475m cash injection. The bank expects the government-owned bank insurance fund to contribute to a further capital strengthening exercise should one become necessary. At end-1991, the bank's equity was just 4.65 per cent of risk-weighted balance sheet items. By end-1992, under Norwegian law, the ratio will have to be 8 per cent. Losses on loans in guarantees rose to NKr1.80bn in 1991 from NKr1.15bn. 'There is reason to expect that the result before losses on lendings will improve in 1992,' Fokus said. Net income from interest and credit fell in 1991 to NKr1.26bn from NKr1.35bn, while other operating income rose to NKr570.1m from NKr524.6m. Fokus swung to an operating loss of NKr259.6m from a profit of NKr4m in 1990. 'The operating result in Fokus Bank in 1991 has been affected by the general difficulties in the Norwegian economy,' Fokus said. Norwegian banks will need more transfers of state cash this year in order to meet new, tough capital adequacy requirements, Norway's central bank governor, Mr Hermod Skaanland, said. 'In the course of 1992, we must expect that the (state) Bank Investment Fund will supply several of the banks with capital to enable them to meet the capital requirements implemented by the end of the year,' Skaanland said. Last year, the state pumped in some NKr16bn to help banks survive.</p>

			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> QUITE A RECEPTION FOR AZTECS;  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO STATE: RECEIVING RECORDS TUMBLE IN 58-31 VICTORY OVER TEXAS EL PASO.  AZTECS CLINCH SECOND CONSECUTIVE WINNING SEASON.  </P> <P> They have been bright spots throughout a mostly frustrating season. Patrick  Rowe and Dennis Arey, together, like a fisherman and his net, catching nearly  everything in sight.  </P> <P> Saturday, during San Diego State's 58-31 victory over Texas El Paso, the NCAA  record book caught them.  </P> <P> Arey caught eight passes for 105 yards, giving him 1,020 yards for the season.  Rowe has 1,290. Thus, the Aztecs become only the second team in NCAA history to  have two receivers catch 1,000 or more yards worth of passes. The first was  Houston, in 1988, when James Dixon and Jason Phillips accomplished it.  </P> <P> "It was like something that was a weight," Arey said. "Now, I don't have to  worry about it. It's something I never imagined."  </P> <P> And that's not all. Rowe caught seven passes for 161 yards, enabling him to tie  the NCAA record and break the SDSU record with eight consecutive games in which  he has had 100 or more yards receiving. Rowe joined Tulsa's Howard Twilley  (1965) and Fresno State's Henry Ellard (1982) in the NCAA record book.  </P> <P> Rowe's 1,290 yards also established a school single-season receiving record,  surpassing the mark of 1,272 set by Gary Garrison in 1964.  </P> <P> This came in front a season-low crowd of 13,927 in San Diego Jack Murphy  Stadium. Rowe kept what was left of the crowd in suspense -- he didn't cross  the 100-yard mark until 1:41 remained in the game, and he needed a 68-yard  touchdown pass from Cree Morris to do it. That gave SDSU a 58-23 lead.  </P> <P> At the end of his run, the entire Aztec bench raced into the end zone and  joined the celebration.  </P> <P> UTEP, though, was not impressed. There was a skirmish after the game as the  teams were heading for the locker rooms, and the Aztecs said UTEP thought SDSU  was trying to run the score up.  </P> <P> "I don't know how it's going to be looked at," Rowe said. "But I had no  intention of running up the score. I'd like to apologize to the UTEP Miners. We  were just trying to get the record."  </P> <P> It was quite a night. The Aztecs clinched consecutive winning seasons for the  first time since 1981-82 and, when everything was wrapped up, they wandered out  of their locker room and into the night hoping to have finished in a tie for  second in the Western Athletic Conference.  </P> <P> Colorado State played at Hawaii late Saturday, and a Ram loss would have  dropped them into a tie for second with the Aztecs (6-4, 5-2 in the WAC).  </P> <P> This was one SDSU Coach Al Luginbill wanted badly. With No. 2 Miami up next in  the season finale, their prospects for a winning season didn't look good unless  they defeated UTEP.  </P> <P> They were able to accomplish that thanks to a tight second-half defense, four  second-half touchdowns, and three Andy Trakas field goals -- 45, 24 and 35  yards.  </P> <P> They finished with 688 yards of total offense to UTEP's 307. Quarterback Dan  McGwire completed 26 of 38 passes for 344 yards. For the first time this  season, he didn't throw a touchdown pass. Back-up Cree Morris threw two in the  fourth quarter, though. One was Rowe's 68-yarder and the other was a 17-yarder  to Jimmy Raye.  </P> <P> UTEP was able to stay relatively close though the first half thanks to several  Aztec mistakes.  </P> <P> A pass interference call on Chris Johnson helped the Miners toward their first  touchdown. With nine minutes to play in the first quarter, on second-and-17  from the SDSU 26, Johnson shoved Ricki Lopez from behind as the ball approached  them. Lopez fell, and a flag followed shortly thereafter.  </P> <P> That gave UTEP the ball at the SDSU 11, and Howard Gasser dumped a short pass  to freshman Ray Ross, who was cutting across the middle. Ross caught the ball,  put several moves on free safety Damon Pieri and at least two other Aztecs, and  scurried into the end zone.  </P> <P> Pio Sagapolutele blocked Jason Gillespie's point after attempt, and the Aztecs  maintained the lead -- which they had taken on a two-yard Curtis Butts  touchdown run -- 7-6.  </P> <P> But two minutes later, Aztec special teams broke down. After a 45-yard Andy  Trakas field goal put SDSU ahead, 10-6, Ross returned the kick 99 yards for a  touchdown. Ross fielded the ball at the UTEP 1, broke straight up the middle,  made it through the seam and easily beat Trakas. It was the second-longest  kickoff return by an opponent in Aztec history.  </P> <P> It wasn't the last time UTEP took advantage of first quarter Aztec mistakes.  After another Trakas field goal -- this one a 24-yarder -- gave SDSU a 16-10  lead, UTEP moved into SDSU territory on a roughing-the-passer call. Gasser was  hit late on second-and-12 from the UTEP 40, and the penalty put the Miners at  the SDSU 45. After an incomplete pass, Gasser again connected with Ross, who  made a big-time, diving catch at the SDSU 18. Four plays later, Gillespie  kicked a 31-yard field goal to give UTEP a 16-13 lead.  </P> <P> The Aztec offense, though, had more weapons. T.C. Wright went right up the  middle for a 47-yard touchdown run on SDSU's next possession, and then, with  just 1:55 left in the second quarter, Wright scored from the 1 to cap a  13-play, 89-yard drive.  </P> <P> Wright finished the first half with 123 yards and two touchdowns on 13 carries.  </P> <P> But the Aztecs had four penalties for 50 yards, and the special teams  breakdown. That's why the Miners were able to hang close despite being  outgained in the half, 314-123, and why they they were able to match their  per-game scoring average of 16 (100th in the nation) in the first quarter.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Aztec Notes:  </P> <P> Just in case you're still not convinced that passing dominates the Western  Athletic Conference: SDSU's T.C. Wright entered Saturday's game third in the  conference in rushing -- with an average of just 60.50 yards a game.... Also  entering Saturday's game, kicker Andy Trakas led the WAC in scoring at 9.22  points a game.... Defensive end Jason Swaney played football at Coronado High  in El Paso.... And they wonder why there's no atmosphere in San Diego Jack  Murphy Stadium: As fans filtered in before the game Saturday, they were greeted  by music videos on the DiamondVision. Supposedly, one of the benefits of the  DiamondVision is that other games could be shown. And USC was playing Notre  Dame... and this was a college football evening. But no. Music videos. Then,  during a change of possession with 6:54 left in the first half, a "Don't Be a  Waterhog" jingle was played over the public address system. Problem was, it  wasn't a timeout. The SDSU offense lined up, the ball was snapped, and  quarterback Dan McGwire handed off to Wright ... and through it all, the "Don't  Be a Waterhog" song continued.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BOWL LINEUP

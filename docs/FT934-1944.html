			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Not such a bad picture Sir, In 'Electronics sector warned of 27,000 job losses' (December 7), you quote a report stating that Scotland's electronics industry is too reliant on manufacturing, which is likely to be lost to lower cost competitors. The picture is not that bleak. While UK-based R&amp;D and marketing must play a bigger role if we are to become serious global competitors, UK manufacturing does not need to rely solely on cost. In the personal computer industry, lead time and benefits of manufacturing within a day's journey of the customer outweigh the cost penalties. All the leading PC manufacturers serving the European market manufacture in Europe, many in Scotland. In our view, they will continue to do so. Andrew Webber, Arthur D Little, Berkeley Square House. Berkeley Square, London W1</p>

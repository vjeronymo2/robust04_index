			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / State plans to take over Serb economy THE Serbian government will introduce measures aimed at bringing most sectors of the economy directly under state control if the United Nations-imposed sanctions last longer than a month, factory managers said yesterday. The measures are part of a package designed to forestall any workers' unrest, particularly in the textile industry, the most successful export sector, which accounts for 12 per cent of Serbia's total GDP. They were drawn up by Mr Radoman Bosovic, Serbia's prime minister, in the light of the growing concern among the textile industry that the sanctions imposed on Serbia and Montenegro three weeks ago will have a catastrophic effect on this sector of the economy. 'The sector employs 200,000 people, or about a quarter of the total labour force,' explained Mr Gradimir Cvetkovic, secretary of Serbia's textile association. 'It is also the most successful arm of the Serbian economy. Between 60 and 80 per cent of the industry's total turnover is earmarked for the export market. The sector accounts for 20 per cent of Serbia's total trade.' About 60 per cent of the textile industry's turnover is exported to the European Community, the rest to the US, eastern Europe, and the former Soviet Union. Last year, textile exports totalled Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 595m), and imports Dollars 600m. The sector accounts for 1 per cent of the world textile market, and holds a 3.5 per cent share of the EC's market. 'We are totally dependent on the export market, and totally dependent on imports, ranging from dyes and chemicals, to material and tanning processes,' said Mr Dragoslav Kojic, manager of Kluz, one of Serbia's most successful textile enterprises which exports 100 per cent of its turnover. He said the sanctions were 'a disaster' for his business. 'I want to send the finished goods to my partners in Germany. But how can I get around the sanctions? Sooner or later we will lose these markets in Europe. They will be snapped up by Czechoslovakia, Hungary, or the Ukraine. It will be very difficult to regain them,' he explained. Mr Kojic employs 6,000 people, and has an annual turnover of DM100m (Pounds 34.2m) a year. Later this month, he will put his work force on paid leave for a few weeks. 'After that, I run out of money, energy, and raw materials, which we import from our partners,' he said. 'I do not know what to tell my workers. The government kept saying we would cope under the sanctions. This is nonsense. They haven't a clue.'</p>

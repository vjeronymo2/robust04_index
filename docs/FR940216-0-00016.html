			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters responded to the agency's request for comments on the merits of requiring a symbol (or graphic) warning about using rear-facing restraints with an air bag. New York's Department of Motor Vehicles supported the use of a symbol because ``a symbol would assist adults who are reading disabled or who speak a foreign language.'' The AAP believed it would be desirable to have a symbol of a child restraint on the vehicle dashboard, ``if a non-confusing symbol can be designed.'' Century commented that a symbol can increase the effectiveness of the warning label ``as long as it adequately identifies and warns of the hazard.'' Cosco expressed reservations about requiring a symbol. That commenter believed a symbol would draw an excessive amount of attention to the issue of the air bag's possible effect on a rear-facing restraint ``over others that may be as bad or worse,'' such as, Cosco believes, the incompatibility of vehicle belts with certain child seats. Cosco also stated that the effectiveness of a symbol depends on the ability of the consumer to recognize it. ``If NHTSA requires such a symbol, it should be prepared to publicize it.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency has decided not to require use of a symbol. Had it been required, the symbol would have been in addition to the words. NHTSA believes that the words will draw sufficient attention to the label, especially since the warning will be subject to the conspicuity requirements discussed in the next section. In response to New York's comment that a symbol would assist adults who are reading disabled or who speak a foreign language, the agency is concerned that there is no universally recognized symbol for effectively communicating the warning at this time. The lack of such familiarity with a symbol would reduce the symbol's effectiveness and could cause confusion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conspicuity of the Label <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The conspicuity of the label is ensured by requirements concerning its location, color and font style. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The aspect of promoting the conspicuity of the label that engendered the most comments was the location of the warning label, i.e., whether the message should be required to be visible to a person in the driver's seat if the restraint were installed rear-facing in the front outboard passenger seating position. Seven commenters responded to this issue. The IIHS concurred that the label should be visible to the driver. Century, Advocates, SafetyBeltSafe, Fisher-Price, and the AAP objected to the driver's side approach. These commenters believed locating the label so that it is visible to the driver reduces the effectiveness of the warning, since the warning would be readable only when the restraint is improperly installed. The commenters believed a driver noticing the label on an improperly installed restraint would be unlikely to take the time to exit the vehicle and move the restraint to the rear seat of the vehicle. Mr. Potter suggested the label should be placed on the shoulder harness/webbing of the restraint. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA agrees that the warning should be visible to the installer while the restraint is being installed. The agency thinks that there is merit in the commenters' belief that a driver who noticed the warning could be reluctant to stop the vehicle to move a rear-facing infant restraint to the vehicle's rear seat after the infant restraint is installed. Further, the driver would already have been provided a warning as a result of the September 1993 rule mandating air bags in passenger vehicles. The rule requires the driver's side sun visor on vehicles with passenger side air bags to be labeled with a warning against using rear-facing child restraints with the passenger side air bag. Accordingly, NHTSA is requiring that the warning on the child restraint be visible to a person who is standing adjacent to the front outboard passenger seat of a vehicle and installing the rear-facing infant restraint system in that seat. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

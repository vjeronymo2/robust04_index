			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / London bus staff to meet on tactics who will be holding their second 24-hour stoppage today - will meet later this week to discuss future options. The bus workers are protesting at management's attempt to buy out existing terms and conditions. Staff claim that new contracts, introduced ahead of privatisation, will mean cuts of Pounds 30 to Pounds 60 a week on the current average earnings of Pounds 280 and a working week up to five hours longer. Two thirds of London's buses were off the road last Wednesday because of the first stoppage.</p>

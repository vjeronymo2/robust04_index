			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Samo Kobenter: "Klestil: Austria Has </F> Overfulfilled the State Treaty"]    [Text] Kopar -- On 12 June Austria will not only vote on  its own integration into the European Union [EU], but on that of  its neighboring country: This was the assessment of Austrian  President Thomas Klestil at the conclusion of his visit, the  first official visit of an Austrian President to Slovenia. At  the concluding conference in the port of Kopar, Klestil said  that he had noted with satisfaction that Slovenia's economic  development has reached an impressive stability since the  military conflict in 1991.    Klestil said that the most important success of his talks  was  an agreement on the improvement of the traffic infrastructure  from Austria to the port of Kopar. In particular the railroad  links with the Styrian border are to be expanded. In addition,  the joint expansion of an early-warning system for the nuclear  power plant of Krsko was agreed. As a sign of the joint  dedication to helping Bosnia, Klestil handed his Slovene  counterpart Milan Kucan 21 million schillings in financial aid.  This money is to ensure schools, training, and food for one  year for 10,000 Bosnian children, who fled to Slovenia.    Regarding the question of Austria's Slovene minority,  Klestil  pointed out that the corresponding Article 7 of the State Treaty  has been fulfilled and that Austria's minority laws go beyond  these stipulations.    President Kucan stressed his country's "great interest in  and  desire for" a positive outcome in the Austrian referendum. This  desire is not based on altruistic interests, but on very  egotistical interests, Kucan said. Slovenia wants to join the  EU as quickly as possible and expects support from Austria.  <H5>  Problems With Italy </H5>   Concerning the latest developments in Italy, Kucan said that  the participation of the neofascists in the government is  arousing certain fears. However, the inviolability of the  borders has been set down in the Helsinki agreements and the  relations with his country have been defined in the Osimo  treaties.</p>

			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A former San Francisco Bay Area corporation will lose its company cars -- a  Maserati and a Jaguar -- at a public auction for failing to pay more than  $168,000 in back taxes, officials said. The two luxury cars belonged to  Certified Garment &amp; Linen Supply Inc. of Moss Beach, which failed to pay  corporate income taxes from 1982 to 1988, said Jim Reber, spokesman for the  state Franchise Tax Board. "I find it very difficult to picture these guys  distributing towels in the back of a Maserati," Reber said. The company's 1977  Maserati Khamsin, valued at $25,000 to $35,000, and its 1973 Jaguar XJ6 were  seized by the San Mateo County Sheriff's Department.  </P></p>

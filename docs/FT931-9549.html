			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / The Perks War: Who is cutting back at the top WITH growth rates falling and budget deficits soaring across the industrialised world, governments are facing pressure from electorates to tone down extravagance. Lavish life-styles of political leaders and their staff, though acceptable when economies are booming, can become a political liability at a time of recession. President Bill Clinton this week has launched a campaign to trim fringe benefits in his new administration, in a bid to show Americans that thrift can provide the key to economic regeneration. Unlike government leaders elsewhere, Mr Clinton is rather too new in office to have frozen his own pay packet. In other countries, politicians and civil servants have been feeling the squeeze for some time. One big question is whether the Group of Seven leading economies will mount a show of austerity when the extravaganza of the annual G7 summit takes place in Tokyo in July - or whether the expensive show will go on as normal. Britain's John Major Mr John Major, the British prime minister, is not - in contrast to his predecessor, Mrs Margaret Thatcher - endowed with a millionaire spouse. Up to now, he has not felt able to afford her grand gesture of waiving an annual pay rise, writes Ivo Dawnay. Nonetheless, the parlous state of the exchequer this year forced all members of parliament and ministers to agree a zero pay rise for 1992-93. Mr Major's remuneration thus remains fixed at Pounds 78,000. Sandwiches, teabags and instant coffee are the main fare at London's premier political residence, all paid for out of private purses. Outside, ministers draw up in strictly graded cars - Jaguars for the grandee secretaries of state, low powered Rovers for the less distinguished and humble Ford family saloons for the lowest orders. Most ministers tend to sit alongside their drivers in the front. As for ministerial expense accounts, British government ethics dictate that while journalists, lobbyists and businessmen can wine and dine their contacts, it would be immoral for the transaction to take place the other way round. After all, that would be squandering taxpayers' money. America's Bill Clinton The perks of office are not the flavour of the week in Washington, writes Jurek Martin. Bill Clinton's Cabinet has been laying waste to many of them, abolishing executive dining rooms, restricting access to chauffeured limousines, limiting magazine subscriptions, closing riding stables in Virginia and enforcing economy air travel. The Clinton family has not benefited financially from the move to Washington. Bill's salary has gone up to Dollars 200,000 (Pounds 132,000) from Dollars 35,000, but Hillary's estimated Dollars 150,000 a year as a lawyer has disappeared, even though her workload has not, and Chelsea, state-educated in Arkansas, is now in a Dollars 14,000 a year private school. Less prominent government employees are now facing up to harsher times. Under the new ethical standards, government employees can only accept free lunches from reporters if they cost less than Dollars 20 a year. This week's campaign was predictable for a populist president intent on setting a good budgetary example, especially after all the criticism of Congress's perks. The Clintons do not have expensive tastes, but they have the bowling alley, the tennis court and use of the ultimate perk, Air Force One. Germany's Helmut Kohl The German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, anxious to set an example of belt-tightening, will keep his annual salary of DM450,000 (Pounds 187,000) unchanged in 1993, writes Judy Dempsey in Berlin. In a climate of concern about the recession, politicians' pay increases have come under growing scrutiny. Members of parliament last month received a pay increase of less than 2.2 per cent, well below the 4 per cent rate of inflation. Ministers, who earn an annual gross income of DM390,000, and parliamentary state secretaries, will receive no pay increase for the second consecutive year. Bonn fringe benefits are already kept under relatively tight control. Three categories of government official have access to a car with driver: a department head, a state secretary, and of course, a minister. But these officials are taxed for the kilometres they are driven either from home to work, or to meetings. In the civil service, still regarded as offering life-time employment, officials who do not pay unemployment benefit contributions from their salaries are expected to be granted a pay increase of about 2.5 per cent this year while civil servants who pay contributions will receive a rise of 3 per cent. Canada's Brian Mulroney Mr Brian Mulroney, the Canadian prime minister, is on a salary of CDollars 138,000 (Pounds 77,530) - now frozen, like other ministers' pay, until 1995, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto. 'We discovered economy before the Americans did,' says an official at the Treasury Board in Ottawa, the agency which oversees Canadian government spending. As long ago as 1984, the prime minister took a 15 per cent pay cut, with other ministers' salaries being reduced by 10 per cent. For the next seven years, the rise in salaries was capped by a formula which, in essence, was the consumer price index minus one percentage point. But ministerial pay was cut again - by 5 per cent - in February 1992, and is due to remain pegged until 1995. For the past two years, use of government aircraft by cabinet ministers has been all but banned for trips to any place served by commercial airlines. Two of the government's eight Challenger executive jets have been converted for search and rescue missions on the east coast. On commercial flights, ministers must use business-class. Each minister is supplied with a car and driver, but any use outside official duties is a taxable benefit. France's Francois Mitterrand President Francois Mitterrand is making his own modest contribution to promoting rigueur in Paris, writes William Dawkins in Paris. His salary  - FFr433,436 (Pounds 54,500) last year - is being raised 1.8 per cent this year, in line with the low increase coming into effect this month for French civil service pay. France's army of 5m public administration employees already live in relative austerity by comparison with politicians, who commonly receive favours in cash and kind from friends and supporters. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, admitted recently receiving a FFr1m interest-free loan from a friend. The civil service, by contrast, is starting to feel the pinch. The state is to cut just over 4 per cent from the running costs of the public service this year, though this will not come from officials' salaries. On paper, it looks as if the public administration is generously paid. with advantages in kind. Some 12,000 cars are reserved for senior civil servants, while 2m state-funded homes are allocated to public employees. Most of these, however, are humble appartments allocated to school teachers and hospital staff. Worse still, all benefits of this kind are taxed. Japan's Kiichi Miyazawa There is little sign that the Japanese economic crisis has been denting ministerial well-being, writes Robert Thomson in Tokyo. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, whose annual pay (including bonus) is Y43.1m (Pounds 229,000), recorded a Y5m rise in assets to Y149.45m during his first year in office, in spite of the stock and property market collapse. Wining and dining of Japanese politicians and bureaucrats has taken a slight turn for the austere, because Japanese companies have been slashing their entertainment budgets. In general, though, the fringe benefits of government have been maintained in spite of the downturn. An important perk of office in Japan is to allow yourself to be entertained at somebody else's expense. The recession has forced most leading companies to cut their entertainment budgets by 20 to 30 per cent. Ministers' salaries are generally not an issue, even though the average worker is earning less overtime and has annual bonuses capped. Japanese political scandals are normally founded not on the greed of an individual politician, but the need of faction leaders to gather enough funds to keep their political machines moving. Italy's Giuliano Amato Prof Giuliano Amato, the Italian prime minister, who receives an annual salary believed to total L78m (Pounds 35,840), has presided over a move towards unfamiliar austerity in Rome, writes Robert Graham in Rome. The free spending habits of Italy's body politic have been checked, with salaries and allowances of members of parliament frozen, and perks cut back. The most important innovation has been to end the practice of deputies who are civil servants - doctors, teachers, university professors, lawyers etc - from claiming two salaries. Until now they received their civil servants pay as well as their parliamentary salaries, but this year they must opt for one or the other. A total of 310 out of 945 senators and members of the chamber of deputies are affected. In parliament, checks have been placed on foreign travel. In the prime minister's office, the number of official cars has been cut from 110 to 40. The number of newspapers received daily has been reduced from 200 to 100, and staff are also subject to limits on the number of newspapers for which they can claim.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 4 Jun (PL) -- The saturation of the market  with large amounts of Cuban-made liquor and cigarettes will  result in a reduction of 500 million pesos (same amount in  dollars) in circulating money this year alone.    This was disclosed today at a plenary meeting held in this  city by the Communist Party Provincial Committee and attended by  officials from the enterprises that manufacture these goods.    The government recently adopted an increase in the prices of  liquor and cigarettes as part of a plan to cleanse national  finances, which are being affected by a surplus of money in  circulation estimated at $11 million.    Some 428,000 cigarette boxes, which will be sold freely,  aside from the quotas assigned by ration cards, as well as over  24 million liters of rum and other alcoholic beverages, will be  available to the population this year.    This effort to reduce money in circulation will be added to  the revenues collected, with the same objective in mind, through  increases in the prices of other nonbasic products.</p>

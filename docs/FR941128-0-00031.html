The ITC recommendations must be given priority consideration by EPA in promulgating test rules. EPA is adding these two chemical substances to two model information-gathering rules: the TSCA Section 8(a) Preliminary Assessment Information Rule (PAIR) and the TSCA Section 8(d) Health and Safety Data Reporting Rule. These model rules will require: Manufacturers and importers of the substances identified herein to report certain production, use, and exposure-related information, and manufacturers, importers, and processors of the listed substances to report unpublished health and safety data to EPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  This rule will become effective on December 28, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Susan B.

E&hyph;543, Washington, DC 20460, Telephone: (202) 554&hyph;1404, TDD: (202) 554&hyph;0551.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  This rule adds ETBE and TAME to the PAIR and the section 8(d) Health and Safety Data Reporting Rule. Manufacturers, importers, and processors of these chemicals will be required to report unpublished health and safety data, and manufacturers and importers will be required to report end use, exposure, and production volume data to EPA. Because the ITC has expressed no need for ecological effects information for the substances being added to the section 8(d) rule via this action, EPA is not requiring the reporting of these data for the subject substances under the section 8(d) rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4(e) of TSCA established the ITC and authorized it to recommend to EPA chemical substances and mixtures (chemicals) to be given priority consideration in proposing test rules under section 4. For some of these chemicals, the ITC may designate that EPA must respond to its recommendations within 12 months. In this time, EPA must either initiate a rulemaking to test the chemical or publish in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  its reasons for not doing so. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On May 17, 1994, EPA announced the receipt of the 34th Report of the ITC, and it was then published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of July 13, 1994 (59 FR 35720). The 34th Report revises the Committee's priority list of chemicals by recommending ETBE and TAME to the section 4(e) priority list.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule adds ETBE and TAME to the PAIR and the section 8(d) Health and Safety Data Reporting Rule. These two rules are model information gathering rules which assist the ITC in making testing recommendations and aid EPA in responding to the ITC recommendations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA issued the PAIR under section 8(a) of TSCA (15 U.S.C. 2607(a)), and it is codified at 40 CFR part 712. This model section 8(a) rule establishes standard reporting requirements for manufacturers and importers of the chemicals listed in the rule at 40 CFR 712.30. These manufacturers and importers are required to submit a one-time report on general volume, end use, and exposure-related information using the Preliminary Assessment Information Manufacturer's Report (EPA Form 7710&hyph;35).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA uses this model section 8(a) rule to gather current information on chemicals of concern quickly. EPA issued the model Health and Safety Data Reporting Rule under section 8(d) of TSCA (15 U.S.C. 2607(d)), and it is codified at 40 CFR part 716. The section 8(d) model rule requires past, current, and prospective manufacturers, importers, and processors of listed chemicals to submit to EPA copies and lists of unpublished health and safety studies on the listed chemicals that they manufacture, import, or process. These studies provide EPA with useful information and have provided significant support for EPA's decisionmaking under TSCA sections 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These model rules provide for the automatic addition of ITC priority list chemicals. Whenever EPA announces the receipt of an ITC report, EPA may, at the same time without further notice and comment, amend the two model information-gathering rules by adding the recommended chemicals. The amendment adding these chemicals to the PAIR and the Health and Safety Data Reporting Rule becomes effective 30 days after publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The reporting of ecological effects data will not be required for ETBE and TAME under the section 8(d) rule. Because no member of the ITC has expressed a need for these data, EPA believes there is no need to collect this information at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Chemicals To Be Added  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its 34th Report to EPA, the ITC recommended ETBE and TAME for health effects testing. EPA is adding these two chemical substances to the PAIR and the section 8(d) Health and Safety Data Reporting Rule. The use of ETBE and TAME to augment or substitute for methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) (CAS No. 1634&hyph;04&hyph;4) as fuel oxygenates and the need for health effects data for ETBE and TAME are of concern to EPA and the ITC. For these reasons, EPA is adding ETBE and TAME to the section 8(d) rule to obtain data to support EPA's ongoing assessments of the potential hazards/risks posed by these two substances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers, importers, and processors of the two substances being listed on the 8(d) rule by this action will not be required to report ecological effects data under the 8(d) rule for those substances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Reporting Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Preliminary Assessment Information Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All persons who manufactured or imported the chemical substances named in this rule during their latest complete corporate fiscal year must submit a Preliminary Assessment Information Manufacturer's Report (EPA Form No. 7710&hyph;35) for each manufacturing or importing site at which they manufactured or imported a named substance. A separate form must be completed for each substance and submitted to the Agency no later than February 27, 1995. Persons who have previously and voluntarily submitted a Manufacturer's Report to the ITC or EPA may be able to submit a copy of the original Report to EPA or to notify EPA by letter of their desire to have this voluntary submission accepted in lieu of a current data submission. See &sect;712.30(a)(3). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Details of the reporting requirements, the basis for exemptions, and a facsimile of the reporting form, are provided in 40 CFR part 712.

A copy of each health and safety study that was previously listed as ongoing or subsequently initiated and is now complete_regardless of the completion date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The bulk of reporting is required at the time the substance is listed. Persons described in categories 1 and 2 do all or most of their health and safety data reporting at the start of the reporting period. The remaining reporting requirements, specifically categories 2(d), 2(e), and 3, continue prospectively. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Detailed guidance for reporting unpublished health and safety data is provided in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of September 15, 1986 (51 FR 32720).

Removal of Chemical Substances from the Rules <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any person who believes that section 8(a) or 8(d) reporting required by this rule is unwarranted, should promptly submit to EPA in detail the reasons for that belief. EPA, in its discretion, may remove the substance from this rule for good cause (40 CFR 712.30 and 716.105). When withdrawing a substance from the rule, EPA will issue a rule amendment for publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Release of Aggregate Data <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA will follow procedures for the release of aggregate statistics as prescribed in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice of June 13, 1983 (48 FR 27041). Included in the notice are procedures for requesting exemptions from the release of aggregate data. Exemption requests concerning the release of aggregate data on any chemical substance must be received by EPA no later than February 27, 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Economic Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Preliminary Assessment Information Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA estimates the PAIR reporting cost of this rule is $14,072. To calculate this figure, EPA used information from a variety of published sources as well as information from OPPTS's Risk Management 1 (RM1) reports on similar chemicals to generate a list of five firms that manufacture and/or import the two chemicals at a total of eight sites. The published sources used include: SRI International's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Directory of Chemical Producers, Chemical Economics Handbook <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Specialty Chemicals <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ; other multi-client studies; the U.S. International Trade Commission's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Synthetic Organic Chemicals <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ; and company product literature. An unknown number of the businesses affected by the addition of the chemicals to the Priority List may qualify as a small business as defined in 40 CFR 712.25(c). However, for this analysis it is assumed that all firms identified will report. Therefore, EPA expects five firms to generate a total of eight reports (some sites produce both of the chemicals).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> &blank;&blank;&blank;&blank;&blank;&blank;&blank;&blank; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Reporting Costs (dollars) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> (a) 8 reports estimated at $924 per report = $7,392  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) 8 sites at $835 per site = $6,680  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Total Cost = $14,072  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mean cost per site = $14,072/8 sites = $1,759  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mean cost per firm = $14,072/5 firms = $2,814  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mean cost per report = $14,072/8 reports = $1,759  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> &blank;&blank;&blank;&blank;&blank;&blank;&blank;&blank; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Reporting Burden (hours) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Rule familiarization: 18 hours/site x 8 sites = 144  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Reporting: 16 hours/report x 8 reports = 128  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Total burden hours = 272  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Average burden per site = 272 hours/8 sites = 34  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Average burden per firm = 272 hours/5 firms = 55 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Average burden per firm = 272 hours/8 reports = 34  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> &blank;&blank;&blank;&blank;&blank;&blank;&blank;&blank; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> EPA Costs (dollars) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Processing cost = 8 reports x $95/report = $760  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Health and Safety Data Reporting Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA estimates the total reporting costs for establishing section 8(d) reporting requirements for the two chemicals will be $10,353. This cost estimate is high because the Agency is uncertain about the likely number of respondents to the rule. Although EPA has used the best available data to make its economic projections, much of the information is based upon the 1986 TSCA Inventory Update and secondary information from industry sources. Therefore, EPA tends to overestimate rather than underestimate reporting burden.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The estimated reporting costs are broken down as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 2,L2(,0,),tp0,p3,8/9,i1,s50,8 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1&blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1&blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 007 0170 intable --> lInitial corporate review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->  <!-- PJG 007 0170 intable --> l$ 2,080  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 007 0170 intable --> lSite identification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->  <!-- PJG 007 0170 intable --> l1,248  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 007 0170 intable --> lFile searches at site  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->  <!-- PJG 007 0170 intable --> l2,829  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 007 0170 intable --> lPhotocopying existing studies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->  <!-- PJG 007 0170 intable --> l428  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 007 0170 intable --> lTitle listing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->  <!-- PJG 007 0170 intable --> l129  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 007 0170 intable --> lManagerial review for CBI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->  <!-- PJG 007 0170 intable --> l2,565  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 007 0170 intable --> lReporting on newly-initiated studies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->  <!-- PJG 007 0170 intable --> l54.52 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 007 0170 intable --> lSubmissions after initial reporting period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->  <!-- PJG 007 0170 intable --> l970.80 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 007 0170 intable --> lTotal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable -->  <!-- PJG 007 0170 intable --> l$ 10,353  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> &blank;&blank;&blank;&blank;&blank;&blank; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Reporting Burden (hours) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Initial review: 2 hours/firm x 15 firms = 30 hrs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Reporting: 10.26 hours/firm x 15 firms = 154 hrs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Total reporting burden hours = 184 hrs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI.

Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments of communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, it has been determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore not subject to OMB review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

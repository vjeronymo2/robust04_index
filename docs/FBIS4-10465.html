			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Oscar Camacho Guzman] </F>   [Text] The Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI] has  conceded during a Permanent Commission meeting that Mexico still  faces "very serious" economic problems. The PRI also believes  that despite the "efforts" taken in past years, the fact that 7  million Mexicans are unemployed is "alarming."    That statement was made during a brief debate held by the  PRI  faction with PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution]  legislators who have criticized the current administration's  economic policy, the "forceful" conditions under which Mexico  joined the Organization for Economic Cooperation and  Development, and the $6-billion line of credit the United States  opened for Mexico following Luis Donaldo Colosio's assassination.    PRD Deputy Alejandro Encinas opened the debate by saying the  announcement of Mexico joining the OECD "seeks to convey an air  of optimism despite the overwhelming evidence that shows our  nation's economic and social decline."    Encinas said this air of optimism also seeks to "stop the  drain of capital, both local and foreign, as a result of the  news" of Colosio's slaying.    Encinas criticized President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's  announcement that Mexico had been accepted into the OECD as a  full-fledged member when the country will not be admitted until  14 April, the date the OECD will issue its formal reply to the  Mexican Government's petition.    Encinas said Mexico will have to make adjustments and  changes  in at least 38 economic fields including capital assets,  services, the environment, foreign investment, agriculture,  trade, and consumer protection policies, among others. He said,  "Mexico is responsible, by joining the OECD, for consolidating a  more thriving economy, which will lead to higher standards of  living for Mexicans by incorporating the public into the job  market, and, overall, for improving the economy."    He also said in order to join the OECD, a country must have  a  solvent market economy and a democratic government that respects  human rights.    The PRD argues Mexico does not meet these conditions, and to  illustrate the weakness of the current economic model, Encinas  mentioned two incidents that followed Colosio's assassination.    First, he mentioned "to prevent the financial crack  triggered  by Colosio's slaying on 23 March, banks, exchange offices, and  the stock market had to be closed to gain time and ask for  foreign assistance."    Application of the "life-saving" mechanism, which consisted  of the United States' establishing for Mexico a $6-billion line  of credit, followed shortly after.    Thus, Encinas added, "the Clinton administration's financial  rescue of the Salinas government and the announcement of  Mexico's membership in the OECD correspond to Washington's basic  interests of national security rather than to the efficient  results of the economic policy, although, for the current  government, they constitute a fundamental step in regaining  foreign investors' trust."    "The risks of a financial crack or a devaluation of the  Mexican peso would spread their harmful effects through the  interdependence between the Mexican and U.S. economies, given  the commitments assumed by U.S. intermediaries in international  markets with the issuance of Mexican currency. It is worth  noting that U.S. pension and investment funds have invested  considerable resources in these financial instruments and would  incur losses in case of an additional upheaval in Mexico."    Finally, he said "the economic slowdown negatively affects  jobs, salaries, small- and medium-sized industries; the foreign  debt has increased, and speculative activities in financial  markets are becoming more volatile, threatening to reduce  international monetary reserves and maintain artificially high  interest rates, given the false value of the Mexican peso."    PRI member Javier Garduno Perez took the podium to respond  to Encinas' statements.    Garduno said Encinas' arguments resembled "a soap opera  script in which the most horrible scenarios are forecast for the  Mexican economy" rather than a first-rate debate.    Garduno claimed that because he did not believe Encinas'  arguments were serious enough, he was not going to refer to them.    Garduno said "I only want to say the PRI has never come to  this forum to tell rose-tinted stories and has never come here  with demagogy to manipulate distorted figures or use different  scenarios and dates for comparison."    "We have always explained the economic situation is still  unresolved, and that there are very serious problems, very  serious. We have made substantial efforts in the past five years  and have not established that an economic policy to achieve  monetary stability is the main goal of the economic policy."    "We have said it is a means to achieve sustainable growth  and  to generate jobs, which are what we need at this time.  Unemployment is the fundamental problem of this country and its  economy. Job creation is one of the main issues the economic  policy must carefully examine, because nearly 8 million Mexicans  are jobless. This is alarming and concerns the PRI very much."    This is why he said that according to his party, efforts  regarding economic policy must be heightened, especially in job  creation, so that public funds can tackle social problems more  efficiently and thus "deal a serious blow to the extreme poverty  affecting millions of Mexicans."  <H5>  To Reorganize Politics: Munoz Ledo </H5>   During yesterday's session, PRD national leader Porfirio  Munoz Ledo demanded the cycle "of impunity, violence, and  suppression that has unfortunately pervaded national politics in  the past years" be closed as soon as possible. Munoz also urged  that dialogue as a means to advance toward a truly democratic  state be strengthened.    In this sense, he called for the resumption of multiparty  dialogue in order to resolve unsettled aspects of electoral  reform, including the electoral register, the media, absentee  votes, the immediate implementation of reforms in the Federal  District, independent nominations, and a more flexible alliance  system. Munoz said all these reforms will help clear up any  doubts about the PRI's trying to impose its candidate in the  coming presidential elections.    PRI member Carlos Jimenez Macias has told Munoz his party  respects and approves the commitments to improve the democratic  system that were signed on 27 January.    In this regard, Jimenez Macias said Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de  Leon, the new PRI presidential candidate, upholds the political  will to increase and deepen the political dialogue so that all  Mexicans will be sure the 21 August elections will be a process  based on total respect of the will of every citizen."</p>

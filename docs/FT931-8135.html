			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Hotel deal expected SPECULATION that an agreement will be announced early next week on the hotel tie-up between Queens Moat Houses and Bass sent shares in both group smartly forward yesterday. However, sources close to the negotiations, which have been continuing since the autumn, suggested that only a limited deal would be announced, squashing rumours that Bass was considering taking a stake in Queens Moat in return for the latter taking a leading role in running Bass's European Holiday Inn operations. The indications are that only a handful of hotels will be involved in the deal, with Queens Moat taking the Holiday Inn franchise for these in return for a small percentage of each unit's turnover. But the hints of an agreement lifted sentiment in both stocks. Queens Moat, Britain's second biggest hotelier, put on 3 1/2 to 54p in turnover of 5.9m. Bass jumped 19 to 604p in 2.7m traded. Land Secs. active Further evidence emerged yesterday of the growing liquidity in the moribund commercial property market as Land Securities said it was in negotiations to sell one of its office developments in a deal thought to be worth around Pounds 70m. The news added impetus to the group's shares which have strengthened in recent weeks on the back of falling interest rates and growing investor interest in the sector. After rallying, they later slipped back to close 1 1/2 up at 474p. In the deal, Land Securities, the UK's biggest property group, would swap an office block in the City of London for the St David's shopping centre in Cardiff owned by Coal Board Investment Nominees. Details of any cash differential are being discussed. Earlier this week, Hammerson announced a Pounds 21m office disposal, while the receivers of Mountleigh, the property company that failed last May, sold the group's largest UK asset, for Pounds 128m to Chelsfield. Hammerson shares rose a penny to 294p. Alert at Lasmo Bid speculation, a more positive outlook on the dividend, and a single large buyer of the shares helped make Lasmo a strong feature. The shares closed 7 up at 179p, as volume rose to a healthy 6.4m, with some of the buying said to have come from the US. Suggestions that the company is a takeover target returned with British Gas and Enterprise Oil named as likely suitors. Several brokers have recently turned more positive on the dividend outlook ahead of the results due at the end of March and Smith New Court have recommended the stock. However, analysts at Strauss Turnbull remain cautious and said that'the financial problems at the company are well recognised and the problem is unlikely to be resolved this year unless we see a dramatic rebound in oil prices which we think is unlikely.' British Gas fell 4 to to 287 1/2 p, on turnover of 4.6m, while Enterprise eased 1 1/2 to 453p. A badly-handled sale order and nervous trading ahead of Tuesday's figures hurt Sedgwick, the insurance broker, and the shares gave up 9 to 169p. In the life sector, United Friendly put on 20 to 600p after overnight trades were executed at the 600p level. Among other oil related stocks, a squeeze in Ramco Oil sent the shares climbing 17 to 126p, while profit-taking was said to have been the reason for the fall in Pittencrieff which lost 14 to 360p, after a presentation to analysts on Thursday evening. Shell Transport eased a penny to 581p in nervous trading ahead of figures next Thursday. Suggestions that Allied Lyons was about to sell its Chateau Latour business to French luxury goods group LVMH were strongly denied by its crossholding partner Guinness, but not before shares in London had been affected by the rumour. Allied gained 10 to 608p, while Guinness slipped 2 1/2 to 468 1/2 p. Shares in Kwik Save rose strongly, up 19 at 819p, as its largest shareholder Dairy Farms took its stake to past 28 per cent in the discount food group. United Biscuits admitted it was considering selling Terry's chocolate business and the shares responded by adding 4 to 354p. Unilever lost 7 to 1146p on nerves ahead of figures next week. Shares in British Aerospace were once again in favour ahead of the figures next week. The shares added 12 to 262p. Many analysts are predicting a big loss for the year and are expected to use Wednesday's results meeting to confirm or adjust forecasts for the current year which range between Pounds 120 and Pounds 150m. The squeeze along with talk of an improvement in UK car sales figures boosted GKN and the shares added another 4 to 476p. Fears of cutbacks in orders from US customers continued to weaken Smiths Industries and the shares lost another 5 to 342p. A large buyer of GEC caused a squeeze and the shares advanced 7 to 297p. UBS Phillips and Drew was said to have upgraded the group. Racal Electronics jumped 10 to 199p. Credit Lyonnais Laing was said to be keen. Vodafone rose 3 to 395p following a big analysts' presentation on Thursday. Some activity in Mirror Group saw the shares fall 3 to 106p as the group denied reports of a boardroom coup. Analysts attributed the fall in Bowater's stocks to traders compensating for a previous overheating which had followed the company's earlier successful rights issue. Blue Circle finished down 1p, in spite of an earlier sharp rise prompted by a combination of continued bid speculation and a yield of 6.5 per cent against a market dividend yield of 4.39 per cent. BPB's strong performance - the company finished up 5 at 234p - was saidb by analysts to be the result of a successful series of marketing trips and a recent price increase in the company's main product, plaster board. Spring Ram finished down another 6p at 123p on market rumours that bear raiders have targetted the company. Hartstone, the hosiery and leather goods distributor, closed at 267p up 16p as volatile trade continued following the announcement that one of the company's executives was taking control of Cupid, the loss-making bridal and formal wear group.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cajnice, 12 Apr (TANJUG) -- NATO aircraft overflew  Serb positions around Gorazde several times late this afternoon  and this evening, dropping to only 1,000 meters, but did not  engage in combat actions, the command of the Herzegovina Corps  has announced.    The Muslims again tried to take advantage of the low-flying  U.S. aircraft, launching a fierce attack from the direction of  Gorazde on the positions of the Herzegovina corps in the region  of Jardiste and Majdan. Their infantry attack was supported by  artillery fire.    As the command of the Herzegovina corps announced, the  attack  has been repelled while the Muslim units, having suffered huge  losses, were returned to their starting positions. One Serb  fighter was killed and two others wounded in the attack.</p>

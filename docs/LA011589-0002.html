			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GROWING UP POLITICAL IN CHICAGO;  </P> <P> FIREBIRD BY JAMES CARROLL (E.P. DUTTON: $18.95; 439 PP.)  </P> <P> Any bookstore worth its bindings will have a big window display of James  Carroll's "Firebird" in place in time for the presidential inauguration. If  winter weather isn't enough to set you shivering, this political thriller will  cause a frisson to run up even the most patriotic spine. What's the last thing  you want to hear as the ex-director of the CIA takes the helm of a kinder,  gentler ship of state? That the boys who run the intelligence community are --  holy red telephone! -- mere mortals who are capable of trading away their  countrymen's very lives to carry out a personal vendetta.  </P> <P> Carroll, who has dealt with the dilemmas of integrity and patriotism before,  notably in "Prince of Peace" (1985) and "Supply of Heroes" (1986), cushions  this revelatory blow a bit by setting his story back in the post-World War II  FBI, but that's thin comfort, given what he has to say. His hero, Chris Malone,  is a boyish idealist cut from the same Midwestern mold as last season's  cinematic Eliot Ness: A dreamy Irish kid who grows up near the Chicago  stockyards and yearns for a job with the FBI, far from his drunken locksmith of  a father. He wants an upstanding, imposing dad like J. Edgar Hoover; if he  can't have one at home, going to work for one is the next best thing.  </P> <P> Malone is just another anonymous Kansas City agent when the call comes from  Washington: The Russians have managed to get hold of American atomic bomb  secrets, and the FBI has to find out how. Webb Minot, one of Hoover's top men,  wants Malone to break into the safe at the Russian embassy and copy the  contents of a code book that will enable the Bureau to translate crucial coded  messages and find the spy. Minot has concocted a phony identity for Malone as  one Peter Ward, a low-level Foreign Service officer who comes completely  equipped with an exotic, mysterious Russian wife named Anna. All Malone has to  do is pretend to be Peter Ward long enough to steal the goods, and he's a big  hero.  </P> <P> Or so he thinks. The real intrigue, of course, starts after he gets the code  book -- or rather, when he enters the code room at the embassy and discovers  that someone has made his job a bit too easy. From that moment on, Carroll's  novel is a juggernaut of cynicism and amorality, driven by men who exhibit the  kind of steely, inhuman resolve that can so easily be mistaken for  selflessness. It wouldn't be fair to give away the final unraveling of the  Firebird plan -- but it suggests that even men of supposed good will, men  entrusted with our national security, fall prey to a peculiarly dangerous  paradox. Although they are no different, no better, than anyone else, they have  a distressing tendency to think that they can play God.  </P> <P> To stick with "Firebird," you have to be one of those people who are fascinated  by the machinations of evil bureaucrats. Carroll comes up with an exhausting  supply of dead ends, false leads, double and triple crosses, and outright lies  for his hero to untangle. For, lest we dismiss his tale as paranoia without  purpose, the author reminds us that this is a coming-of-age story, as much as  it is a political thriller. Malone has to work his way through the maze -- as  he all too frequently reminds us -- to discover, not just the truth about the  FBI, but the truth about himself.  </P> <P> Carroll has a heavy hand when it comes to the psychological aspects of his  story; maybe he's worried that the reader, head reeling from the  Russian-American-British intrigues, will miss the sub-text. He sets up Malone's  early affection for Minot well enough, but then feels compelled to relate every  incremental slippage of that affection as Malone moves, inexorably, toward  enlightenment. The pace gets sludgy, and what is meant as an emotional signpost  begins to seem like a distraction.  </P> <P> And the enigmatic Anna is the definitive literary onion: Malone keeps peeling  and peeling, but there's always more to find out, always one more layer to her  complex tale. Luckily, Anna has one attribute that Beth, the wan little  sweetheart that Malone left behind, didn't seem to possess: Anna is a knockout.  Whenever Malone's energy starts to lag, he and Anna have a rousing sexual  encounter, and somehow he finds the strength to go on.  </P> <P> The pay-off is nicely complex, if dated. If this were a movie (and the  specificity of some of the locations does seem like a hopeful hint to any  producers who might pick up the book), the audience would likely cheer the  hero's epiphany. The only question is: Would they get as far as the parking lot  before they started to worry about who runs the show after the honorable  fellows have packed their bags? Good thing "Firebird" is fiction.  </P></p>

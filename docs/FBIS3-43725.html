As Craig Doonan  reports, Buthelezi has been addressing a kwaZulu Legislative  Assembly meeting today:    Buthelezi says Inkatha and kwaZulu face two options. One is  to continue negotiating with the ANC and government, and  restating its demands repeatedly, while the other is to call  their bluff and pull out of talks. He said it is time for  Inkatha to move from a reactive to a proactive position and to  display to the country a clear message of opposition. Although  he did not say exactly what type of opposition politics he  means, he did refer briefly to mobilizing against the 27 April  election.    Buthelezi said the IFP and kwaZulu are wasting time by  talking to the ANC and government. As he says, their demands  are not being heard or met. Buthelezi has also called for  another IFP Central Committee meeting on 22 January, 2 days  before Parliament reconvenes to adopt amendments to the interim  constitution. Turning to allegations of hit squads in the  kwaZulu police, Buthelezi has denied reports of a five-man squad  operating this force, as revealed by the Goldstone Commission.  He has also repeated his opposition to the TEC [Transitional  Exeutive Council], saying the kwaZulu government will not  recognize this body, nor will it cooperate with it in any way.</p>

			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Bloomfield avoids becoming bankrupt MR PAUL BLOOMFIELD, a prominent property trader with debts of nearly Pounds 60m, has avoided bankruptcy by agreeing a voluntary arrangement with creditors. The agreement, under UK insolvency law, gives him five years to repay 50p in every pound he owes. Mr Bloomfield was the dealmaker behind some of the largest property transactions of the 1980s, notably for Mountleigh, the property company that is now in receivership. The deals included Paternoster Square, the former Observer headquarters and plans to redevelop Battersea Power Station with Mr John Broome. Mr Bloomfield was a bankrupt for 20 years until the bankruptcy was annulled in 1988. Apart from personal assets of Pounds 500,000, his only source of funds to repay his creditors are potential profits from deals enacted by his companies. He can continue to be a director of more than 30 companies which include Fort-lodge, his main vehicle, and Keatway, a company formed from the restructuring of Benlox, the troubled building and engineering company. A spokesman for Mr Bloomfield said he was confident that he would repay his creditors in full. His proposed deals include Russian timber contracts and an Pounds 895,000 acquisition of the Roundhouse in Camden, north London. Mr Bloomfield's largest creditor is United Dutch Group, which claims that he owes it Pounds 33.8m, although Mr Bloomfield says the debt is Pounds 28m. In 1990, United Dutch Group bought ICA Holdings, Mr Bloomfield's vehicle for his attempted redevelopment of Battersea Power Station. Mr Bloomfield also owes Pounds 7.5m to Lonrho's Observer subsidiary, Pounds 2.5m to Greenaway Harrison, a subsidiary of the Observer, and Pounds 100,000 to Ashraf Marwan, an Egyptian financier. He has also given personal guarantees of Pounds 7.2m to Credit Suisse and Pounds 6.5m to Hongkong &amp; Shanghai bank. The nine creditors have appointed Mr Richard Long of Robson Rhodes, the accountancy firm, as supervisor to the five-year repayment programme. 'He is adamant that everyone will be paid back,' Mr Long said.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To better meet market demand regarding the size of potatoes, the committee recommended an additional requirement that at least 40 percent of the potatoes in each lot must weigh at least 5 ounces. It is anticipated that requiring handlers to ship such heavier potatoes will enable the industry to regain its lost share of the market and increase returns to producers and handlers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 8e of the Act requires that when certain domestically produced commodities, including Irish potatoes, are regulated under a Federal marketing order, imports of that commodity must meet the same or comparable grade, size, quality, or maturity requirements, subject to concurrence by the U.S. Trade Representative. Section 8e also provides that whenever two or more marketing orders regulating a commodity produced in different areas of the United States are concurrently in effect, the Secretary shall determine which of the areas produces the commodity in more direct competition with the imported commodity. Imports, then must meet the quality standards set for the particular area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the case of potatoes, the current import regulation [7 CFR 980.1] specifies that import requirements for long type potatoes be based on those in effect for potatoes grown in certain designated counties in Idaho, and Malheur County, Oregon, during each month of the marketing year. While no changes are required in the language of section 980.1, imports of long type potatoes would have to meet the increased minimum weight requirements proposed herein.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 945.341(i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Applicability to imports <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is being removed from the handling regulations. That paragraph states the same information that is contained in section 980.1 of the import regulations. Since the same information applicable to imported potatoes is contained in the import regulations, paragraph (i) in the domestic handling regulations is being deleted to eliminate duplication or confusion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on available information, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule concerning this action was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on August 9, 1994 [59 FR 40477]. Comments on the proposed rule were invited from interested persons until August 24, 1994. No comments were received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After consideration of all available information, it is found that the action, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with section 8e of the Act, the United States Trade Representative has concurred with the issuance of this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  because: (1) This action was unanimously recommended by the Committee; (2) the new shipping season for the 1994&hyph;95 crop of Russet Burbanks began September 1, 1994, and this rule should be effective promptly to cover as many potatoes of the 1994&hyph;95 crop as possible; and (3) the proposed rule provided a 15-day comment period and no comments were received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 945  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Marketing agreements, Potatoes, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR part 945 is amended as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=56 g=1 f=1 --> PART 945_IRISH POTATOES GROWN IN CERTAIN DESIGNATED COUNTIES IN IDAHO, AND MALHEUR COUNTY, OREGON  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Press review] </F>   [Text] The newspaper TISHRIN addresses the resumption of  the bilateral talks in Washington yesterday amidst unencouraging  Israeli developments. This shows, the paper says, that Israel  wants these talks to continue to revolve in a vicious circle and  to remain monotonous and futile.    TISHRIN also notes the encouraging U.S. position. It says  the United States has renewed its full commitment to just and  comprehensive peace, and underscored Syria's leading role in the  peace process.    TISHRIN adds: It is interesting that U.S. news reports have  spoken of a new tour of the region in early March by U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher. This means that the  United States will be awaiting the outcome of the second round  of talks held at the chief delegates' level in Washington. Once  this round is concluded, Secretary of State Christopher will  make moves within the context of a regional tour.    TISHRIN goes on to say: Israel has not thus far shown any  concern over possible regional developments if the second round  of the Washington chief delegates' talks fail and the peace  process reaches a dead end. Israel alone has continued to  oppose compliance with international legitimacy resolutions.  That is why it is making strenuous attempts to render the U.S.  role void of any meaningful content. As a matter of fact,  Israel is casting doubts on the usefulness of this role.    TISHRIN says: Israeli skepticism over the possible  achievement of progress in the Washington bilateral talks is  part of the Israeli procrastination and prevarication policy.  It aims to frustrate all peace efforts. This has been  corroborated by Israel's decision to ignore the outcome of the  Geneva summit between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton, and its  disregard for all peace efforts.    TISHRIN concludes by saying: The peace process could be  redeemed if the United States plays a constructive and positive  role as a full partner and an honest broker. This is necessary  to make Israel meet the requirements of just and comprehensive  peace.    The newspaper AL-BA'TH comments on the impossible conditions  Rabin has raised anew, saying: The articulation of these  conditions coincides with the resumption of the Washington  bilateral talks. These conditions are designed to circumvent the  true requirements of peace. Rabin resorts to these tunes  whenever he experiences an increasing isolation with regard to  peace efforts.    AL-BA'TH adds: Since the convocation of the Madrid  conference, Israel has continued to speak about the kind of  peace we are offering, not because it is unaware of that, but  because it deliberately seeks to circumvent the peace process  unleashed by the Madrid conference, and promoted by the Geneva  summit, which produced remarkable results. Israel alone does  not want to acknowledge many facts pertaining to peace efforts,  primarily those related to the need to achieve just and  comprehensive peace. One of these facts concerns the need for  the Zionist occupation troops to withdraw from all occupied Arab  territories, as provided for in the U.S. peace initiative and  the relevant international resolutions.    AL-BA'TH goes on to say: Rabin's renewed refusal to address  the question of withdrawal from the Golan or southern Lebanon  before he knows the kind of peace advocated by Syria is a  flagrant attempt at circumvention. There is no alternative to  rehabilitating the Madrid conference formula and the Geneva  summit outcome, which provided a definition of peace that is  acceptable not only to Syria, but also to the entire world  community, which is supposed to accord due respect to  international legitimacy resolutions.    AL-BA'TH concludes by saying: Rabin, who must have been  familiar with the U.S. peace initiative and the outcome of the  Geneva summit, is well aware that the achievement of just and  comprehensive peace in the region is contingent upon compliance  with the provisions enshrined in this initiative, and also with  the consensus of the entire world community. Consequently,  attempts to evade the requirements of peace will not last long.    In a commentary today, the newspaper AL-THAWRAH says: The  statements made by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin on the  eve of the resumption of the Washington bilateral talks on the  chief delegates' level, in which he reiterated Israel's refusal  to withdraw to the pre-1967 borders, are not designed for  domestic consumption. As a matter of fact, these statements  enjoy the support of Zionist parties of all colors and hues.  They reflect a desire to consecrate occupation and promote the  Israeli scheme and strategy, which are grounded in aggression  and expansion.    AL-THAWRAH adds: Rabin's statements do not only reflect  political oneupmanship. These statements, coupled with the  Israeli conduct in the ongoing peace talks, show that Israel  only seeks to consecrate the occupation, build biblical Israel,  and subjugate the Arab region. Since the convocation of the  Madrid conference, Israeli politicians and generals have been  lending half-hearted support for the peace process. They are  not sincere in their handling of the international and U.S.  efforts to achieve peace.    AL-THAWRAH goes on to say: The world has continued to feel a  deliberate Israeli determination to scuttle the peace process  and overlook the relevant international legitimacy resolutions.  Israel is making feverish attempts to circumvent these  resolutions, undermine them, and give them interpretations that  would enable the aggressors to retain the gains of aggression  and occupation.    Concluding its commentary, AL-THAWRAH wonders: Given all  these international resolutions, which are the terms of  reference of the peace process, this Israeli determination to  defy the international community's wishes, and these constant  Israeli human rights abuses, should the international community  not act to render Israel accountable to the this community,  particularly since less dangerous situations have resulted in  the punishment of entire peoples and nations?</p>

			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: C &amp; G Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester might fairly claim to be the victim of poor quality legislation. But the performance to which it has gone in restructuring the offer from Lloyds Bank raises some concerns about valuation and fairness. Although consummation of the deal has been pushed back by three months, the price has been left at Pounds 1.8bn. Lloyds will thus enjoy a better deal in two ways. The time value of money will make the price less onerous and C &amp; G's net assets will be boosted by a further three months of retained earnings. So Lloyds will squander less on goodwill. The amount involved may not be enormous but the fact that it has been wholly ignored in the revision suggests a degree of imprecision in the original valuation. The trouble is that C &amp; G members have little to go on when they vote. Moreover they must do so now in the clear knowledge that the distribution of rewards is random and arbitrary. Under a scheme designed to meet the requirements of the law, some members will be denied any share of the proceeds. Some non-member depositors will receive a bonus. In a rational world it ought to be possible for a bank to buy a building society. There is no reason why the latter should be ring-fenced by protective legislation. One solution which would have made valuation easier and ensured a fairer distribution of benefits would have been for C &amp; G to begin the process by de-mutualisation and public flotation. Once again, the law prevents this by insisting on a five-year period before newly-floated societies can be taken over. It really is an ass.</p>

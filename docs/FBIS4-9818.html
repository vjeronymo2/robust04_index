			<p>BFN     [Text] The Defense Ministry and the Armed Forces suggested  yesterday that Colombia join Protocol II of the Geneva  Convention of 1949, a multilateral agreement that contains the  international human rights principles that cannot be violated  during armed conflicts. The protocol bans terrorism as a form of  armed struggle, inhumane and collective punishments, torture,  the taking of hostages, and, especially, attacks on the civilian  population, church representatives, and medical missions, among  others.    The Cesar Gaviria government decided to submit to Congress a  bill to include Protocol II in Colombian legislation after  deeming that the agreement does not adversely affect the  country's sovereignty, nor undermine the operational  capabilities of the Public Force in the fight against armed  rebels.    Defense Minister Rafael Pardo Rueda and General Ramon Emilio  Gil, commander of the Armed Forces, sent a letter to President  Cesar Gaviria yesterday saying it was "advisable" for Colombia  to join the Protocol II. The defense minister said adherence to  Protocol II "would not imply the recognition of the guerrilla  groups as a belligerent force."    The government's adherence to what has been stipulated in  the  aforementioned protocol is, in practice, Colombia's  demonstration to the international community that in the country  the rights of the participants in the armed conflict are  respected, which means that international human rights norms are  respected.    Protocol II supplements Article 3 of the Geneva Convention,  which refers to the protection of persons who are victims or who  are adversely affected by the conflict. This agreement  regulates the treatment given to persons not involved in the  conflict or those who have intervened in the conflict but are no  longer capable of participating in it.    Protocol II, in addition to prohibiting the taking of  hostages, homicides, torture, practices such as slavery,  terrorism, pillage, and collective punishments, also calls for  the protection of persons who have been stripped of their  freedom.    In the case of a noninternational conflict that is taking  place on the territory of a high contracting party (the state,  in this case Colombia), Protocol II is applied as long as the  rebels are carrying out their actions under a responsible  command and are exercising control over part of the territory  that can allow them to conduct sustained military operations.  If these conditions (as in the case of Colombia) are not  fulfilled, the guerrillas may not apply the protocol rules.    In this regard, in the letter sent to President Gaviria,  Pardo and Gil pointed out that the country's adherence to  Protocol II "would not imply recognition of the guerrilla groups  as a belligerent force because adherence only implies a  commitment by the state or the high contracting party. Besides,  it is clear that the illegal armed groups are not subject to  international law."    The text of Pardo and Gil's letter sent to the president  follows:    Mr. President: At the direction of the Armed Forces General  Command, the Joint Staff has conducted a study of the main  recommendations that have been made regarding the advisability  of adhering to Protocol II of the Geneva Convention of 1949.    The arguments in favor and against have been reviewed, the  results of which are contained in an attached document. In  general, we have found that adherence to the aforementioned  protocol would not imply recognition of the guerrilla groups as  a belligerent force because adherence only implies a commitment  by the state or the high contracting party. Besides, it is  clear that the illegal armed groups are not subject to  international law.    We may conclude, therefore, that the aforementioned  organizations will not have the go ahead to freely conduct  gun-running activities or to have diplomatic representation  abroad; in no case will the members of the aforementioned  organizations, who may be captured, receive prisoner of war  status and they must surrender to the justice system as it is  now done.    Seen in light of international law and other such  protocols, particularly Article 3 of Protocol II, it is clear  that national sovereignty will be respected at all times: To  the letter, Article 3 of Protocol II states: "No provision of  this protocol may be cited to undermine the sovereignty of a  state or to defend the national unity and territorial safety of  a state by all legal means." [sentence as published] Therefore,  the state's ability to repress and control subversion will not  be reduced at all.    The Armed Forces are in compliance with those provisions of  International Humanitarian Law that are included in Protocol II  in question. The laws and regulations that govern the Armed  Forces meet the requirements set forth in said Protocol II.  Hence, its application will not imply any degree of limitation  or diminishment of the Public Force's operational capability.    Furthermore, as established by No. 2 of Article 214 of the  Constitution, the provisions of International Humanitarian Law  will be abided by during a state of emergency. This obviously  includes those cited in Protocol II. These provisions, then,  were in effect during the State of Internal Disturbance, from 8  November, 1992, to 4 August, 1993.    Upon the conclusion of said state, this Ministry felt that  the Armed Forces should continue to abide strictly by these same  rules and issued Defense Ministry Directive No. 017 of August  1993. In so doing, the Ministry issued permanent orders and  instructions to all members of the Armed Forces, regarding the  respect for and adherence to Human Rights and International  Humanitarian Law. The directive also provides for training  personnel in these areas, which are the same areas invoked by  Protocol II.    Last, the attached document includes several  recommendations,  based mainly on the following two aspects: 1) The need to adopt  the necessary legal measures to penalize serious violations --  yet to be defined -- of the regulations listed in Article 3,  which are common to the Geneva Convention and Protocol II; and  2) The need for prior study of any reservations presented by  other states regarding the provisions of Protocol II, as an  important elements in analyzing the new instrument.    As stated in this note and in the attached documents,  therefore, we believe it would be beneficial to present this  Protocol II of the 1949 Geneva Convention to the Honorable  Senate for discussion during the current congressional session.    Signed: Defense Minister Rafael Pardo Rueda and General  Ramon Emilio Gil Bermudez, the commanding general of the Armed  Forces.</p>

			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Bank of America says problem assets now total Dollars 5bn BANK OF America, the leading bank in the western US, yesterday disclosed an increased level of problem assets as it released its first fully integrated quarterly results since its takeover of the loss-making Security Pacific was completed last year. The San Francisco-based bank said the total problem assets pending sale totalled Dollars 5bn, up from a previous estimate of Dollars 4.4bn. Bank of America's share price closed down Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 41 5/8 . Net profits for the third quarter were Dollars 476m, or Dollars 1.22 per share. But Bank of America said the result was not comparable with its third-quarter 1991 net profits of Dollars 285m, or Dollars 1.20 per share. The net effect of non-recurring items, including merger-related restructuring expenses and a gain on the sale of a payroll processing business, was a Dollars 175m charge in the first nine months of 1992. For those nine months, the bank's net income was Dollars 1.02bn, which is not comparable with the Dollars 839m earned in the same period last year. Mr Dick Rosenberg, chairman, said the earnings were 'solid' and that the integration of Security Pacific's operations was proceeding on schedule. Net loan losses during the quarter were Dollars 371m, consisting Dollars 460m of write-offs and Dollars 89m of recoveries. Most write-offs were in the consumer, construction and property sectors. The return on assets for the nine-month period was 0.85 per cent, while return on equity was 12.39 per cent. Bankers Trust, the New York bank, achieved Dollars 211m of net profits in the third quarter, a 14 per cent rise year-on-year. Earnings per share were Dollars 2.45, up 13 per cent. First Interstate Bancorp, the 11th largest US bank holding company, staged a sharp third-quarter recovery, turning in profits of Dollars 75.1m, compared with a loss of Dollars 207.5m a year earlier. For the first nine months, net profit totalled Dollars 200.2m, compared with a loss of Dollars 220.2m for the 1991 period.</p>

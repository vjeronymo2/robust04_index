			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Exchange rules out Anglia action The Stock Exchange said yesterday that it would take no action against Anglia Television's directors after reviewing the Department of Trade and Industry's report on alleged insider dealing in the company's shares. The exchange had been examining whether Lady Archer, an Anglia director, had taken sufficient steps under its Yellow Book rules to prevent the leakage of price-sensitive information and to ensure that her husband, Lord Archer, did not deal in Anglia shares before MAI's Pounds 292m takeover of the television company. DTI inspectors had been told that on January 12, Lady Archer attended an Anglia board meeting, at which the price proposed by MAI for the Anglia takeover was first discussed. On the following day, Lord Archer placed an order to buy 25,000 Anglia shares on behalf of an acquaintance, Mr Broosk Saib. A further 25,000 shares were bought for Mr Saib on January 14. On January 18, when the takeover bid was publicly announced, Lord Archer ordered the sale of the shares, netting a profit for Mr Saib of just over Pounds 77,000. Anglia said last night that the exchange's finding confirmed its own investigations. The DTI said in July that it would be taking no further action against Lord Archer, the bestselling novelist and former deputy chairman of the Conservative party. It plans to issue a reply in the next few days to a question from Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade secretary, about whether there is any legal impediment to the publication of the report if Lord Archer gives his consent.</p>

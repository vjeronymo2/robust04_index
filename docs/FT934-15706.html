			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Arts: Painting is life or death, every time - Lyn MacRitchie talks to artist Dorothea Tanning IT IS sometimes the case that all the future themes of an artist's work are encapsulated in an early canvas. 'Birthday', created by Dorothea Tanning in 1942, is one such painting. A self-portrait, exquisitely drawn and delicately coloured, it shows the young artist standing bare foot and bare breasted in front of a perspective of open doors, a furry familiar, half beast, half bird at her feet. She wears a purple doublet, and a skirt trimmed with branches that on careful examination can be seen to turn into naked female forms just where they should be sprouting into twigs. 'Birthday' did more than set the theme for Tanning's subsequent work. It also brought her Max Ernst. The great surrealist painter, acting on behalf of his then wife, Peggy Guggenheim, was selecting work for a group show of women artists. Tanning had already been signed by the dealer Julien Levy, patron of the Surrealist exiles in New York, who recommended that Ernst see her. 'Birthday' was on her easel when he called. It is easy to see why he made sure he came back. They married, in a double ceremony with Man Ray and Juliet Browner, in 1946 and were together until his death 30 years later. Tanning, born in Galesburg, Illinois in 1910, went into training for her future life at an early age, escaping the confines of the small midwestern town and a strict Lutheran upbringing by allowing her 'raging imagination' to roam, assisted by a diet of Carroll, Wilde, Flaubert, Poe and Coleridge. In 1930 she left for Chicago, determined to become an artist. It was not until she reached New York in 1936, however, that she found the confirmation she was seeking. Visiting the exhibition 'Fantastic Art, Dada and Surrealism' that year at the Museum of Modern Art she felt she was experiencing 'an explosion'. 'I thought of myself as an artist who was doing and painting things from my imagination. When I saw that show, I saw that other people were doing it, it was not proof of a sick mind but an adventurous one . . .' she told me. Some of her works painted over the next 15 years have become classics of surrealist painting, delineating the landscape of repressed sexuality and desire with a unique authenticity as well as high graphic and painterly skill. Tanning's dark world, where young girls contemplate monstrous flowers or mysterious closed doors, or heap on each others' shoulders in delicious twists of buttocks and faces swirled with tearing drapery and flying hair seem not so much prurient fantasies as accurate depictions, faithful renderings of troubled and troubling feelings. She does not shrink from the explicit. 'Interior with Sudden Joy' 1951, incudes a rosy detail wrapped in a sinister twist of drapery that makes very clear the source of that joy the two knowing girls have discovered. This picture was painted in Arizona, in the little house she and Max Ernst built on top of a hill in Sedona, where they lived surrounded by vistas of desert and sky. Conscious of the interior nature of her own inspiration, Tanning worked indoors. 'Then as now the decibels of nature can crush an artists' brain. I have seen it happen,' she wrote. 'So I lock the door and paint interiors.' She denies that her painting are particularly erotic. 'Eroticism is in all of us - there is some of that in my painting, but it would be a shame to say that that is all there is . . . They are about the essential humanity in all of us.' The progress of her work, and the Camden show includes selected works from 1942 until 1992, is a progress of size rather than content. This progress begins in the 1950s, when the paint gets thinner and the figures larger, the nature of their relationships more clearly defined. In 'Death and the Maiden', 1953, a man hoists a young girl into the air, crushing her thighs against his chest. In 'Family Portrait', 1954, the huge figure of the father looms over the table. While the wife is reduced to a tiny provider of food, the budding daughter presents herself to the viewer, her sexuality both the source of the painting's tension and the means towards her liberation. In 'Tableau Vivant', also 1954, the begging family dog has assumed a rampant role, the young woman, how naked, swooning between his paws. For the next 30 years dogs and naked flesh fill ever bigger canvases, their swirling forms combined in a cosmic dance of sensuality and liberation not to everyone's taste. Some spectators at the private view even doubted if these works were by the same artist. Tanning was shocked by this, but philosophical. 'People always want to pigeon hole you . . . once they know something, that is all they want.' She herself has no doubts about her progress. 'When I look at the early works, I couldn't paint like that today, with those tiny little brushes. It happens with time, with the epoch - if someone did that today it would be an anomaly.' With typical prescience, she spent five years between 1969 and 1974 making objects from cloth, sewing black velvet fetishes and whole stuffed interiors with writhing figures breaking through the walls. The examples at Camden are some of the best works in the show, the skill of their construction and the power of their imagery striking and fresh even now when installations are a gallery commonplace. Though she is now too frail to continue to paint large canvases, Dorothea Tanning is still hard at work, with drawings, watercolours and collages engaging her ever fertile imagination. At 83 she says, 'The act of making a new painting is like jumping out without a parachute - it's life or death every time.' Dorothea Tanning: Works 1942-1992.

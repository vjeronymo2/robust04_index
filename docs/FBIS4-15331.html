			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by unidentified BELINFORM correspondent for TASS] </F>   [Text] Minsk 7 April, TASS -- Belarusian Parliament Speaker  Mechyslaw Hryb called for restoration of full-fledged economic  ties with Russia as a way of pulling the former Soviet Republic  out of the global crisis, of halting output decline and curbing  inflation.    Addressing on Thursday a meeting in Vitebsk with regional  law-enforcement officers, the parliament chairman came out in  favour of rebuilding a single industrial, energy, market and  trade space with Russia, as well as of a single monetary system  based on the Russian rouble. Hryb noted that Russia was the  main supplier of energy resources and of a great variety of  component parts for the Belarusian economy.    When asked whether there was any alternative to a treaty  with  Russia, the speaker said: "First, we could agree to lift all  customs barriers and duties, and then go ahead with further  moves, bearing in mind that both economic and political  sovereignty of the Belarusian state should be kept intact. This  means that the Belarusian budget should by no means merge with  that of Russia, nor the Republic's national bank can be  absorbed," Hryb stressed.</p>

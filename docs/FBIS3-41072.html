The council will  end 1993 with 22 million [cruzeiros] in cash that it has  collected from the auctioning off of property confiscated from  the drug traffic and from payments by agencies preparing  educational campaigns with money obtained through budget  amendments submitted by congressmen.    The shortage of funds has led the council's president, Isaac  Barreto, to reject practically all requests to finance video  clips, since the budget has been too tight to produce even one.  The advertising campaigns against drug use in the Federal  District and the states of Rio de Janeiro, Rondonia, and Parana  were produced with funds obtained by congressmen through budget  amendments.    Confen has distributed social subsidies totaling 39.7  million  cruzeiros (at April values) to 120 welfare agencies, most of  them therapy groups. To gain access to those subsidies this  year, the institutions will have to submit a new statement of  assets to the National Social Welfare Council, an agency of the  Ministry of Health. The reason is that the council does not want  to run the risk of handing out money to agencies that are  cheating the federal administration.    Despite the shortage of money, something unprecedented  happened this year at Confen. Four institutions linked to  congressmen, including one institute belonging to Federal Deputy  Raquel Candido (no party, Rondonia), returned about 11 million  cruzeiros that had not been used in the prevention campaigns.  <H5>  Secretariat Will Support Council </H5>   The National Narcotics Secretariat, which was recently  approved by President Itamar Franco, is going to help the  National Council on Narcotics (Confen) implement national policy  in that area. Auctions of property seized from drug traffickers  will be held by the secretariat, which will also administer the  money collected in that way.    At the beginning of December, Confen held a meeting to  prepare for the one that will be held in January. Its purpose  was to decide how to spend the small amount of funds available.  The council's president, Isaac Barreto, said that the work of  preventing drug use would continue to occupy a prominent place  through the encouragement of regional campaigns like those  organized in the Federal District, Parana, Rio de Janeiro, and  Rondonia. The National Narcotics Secretariat will be given the  funds from the Fund for Prevention, Rehabilitation, and Combat  Against Drugs (Funcab) that currently belong to Confen. Funcab's  funds consist of federal appropriations, gifts from domestic and  international agencies, auction proceeds, and the proceeds of  fines levied in connection with the control and supervision of  controlled drugs and medicines and of chemicals used to  manufacture and process drugs.    Funcab's entire budget for 1994 will be devoted to programs  to provide vocational training concerned with education,  prevention, treatment, repression, control, and supervision in  connection with drug use and drug trafficking. Carrying out  campaigns and modernizing repression activities will also be  priority activities for the new secretariat. Forty percent of  Funcab's funds will go to the Federal Police.    The National Narcotics Secretariat will have a slim  structure, with only two departments and nine commissioned  positions. Still to be named is its secretary, who will face  strong resistance on the part of the Federal Police. Sectors in  the Federal Police believe that the new agency is going to  dilute the duties currently assigned to that police force.</p>

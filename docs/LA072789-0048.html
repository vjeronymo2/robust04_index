			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: OCEANSIDE  </P> <P> An 47-year-old woman pleaded guilty Wednesday to involuntary manslaughter for  helping her daughter attempt an abortion that led to the death of a newborn  baby.  </P> <P> Ida Franks entered her plea before San Diego Superior Court Judge Andrew  Wagner, which included an agreement with the district attorney's office that  could led to a one-year jail sentence.  </P> <P> Wagner set sentencing for Aug. 23. Franks remains free on her own recognizance.  </P> <P> Franks' daughter, Vickie Judkins, 24, of Oceanside, testified April 28 in her  mother's preliminary hearing that, days before she gave birth to twins, her  mother used a Lysol-soaked straw to induce an abortion.  </P> <P> Judkins said that, many years ago, her mother had done the same thing to  herself when she was pregnant.  </P> <P> In Judkins' case, one twin was born dead on Dec. 30, 1987, but the other was  born alive, though it soon died. The deliveries occurred at Judkins' home,  though she went to the store to purchase some beer before the second baby was  delivered.  </P> <P> Judkins said her mother and her husband, Willie Judkins, a Marine stationed at  Camp Pendleton, took the bodies away and put them in a trash bin off Interstate  5.  </P> <P> The bodies have never been recovered.  </P> <P> Vickie Judkins pleaded guilty to child endangerment March 21 and was sentenced  June 1 to five years' probation and 160 hours of community service in an  Oceanside soup kitchen.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Shoichito Toyoda, chairman of the Federation </F> of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), by unidentified MAINICHI  SHIMBUN reporter; place, date not given]    [Text] [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] As the new Keidanren chairman,  and a representative of the auto industry, what plans do you  have to break the deadlock over Japan-U.S. relations?    [Toyoda] As a matter of fact, automobiles represent a very  large part of Japan's trade surplus. But, as Keidanren  chairman, I should not serve only the auto industry. It is  important in the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks to  adequately implement macro economic policies. As each  industrial sector is appropriately working on negotiation in its  field, I want Keidanren to deal with macro economic issues.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What is your attitude toward political  donations and relations between politicians and the business  sector?    [Toyoda] The previous leadership of Keidanren decided not to  engage in political donations, and I will follow that policy.  Japan's politics is currently undergoing great changes, and we  would like to watch developments. Offering donations is not the  only way Keidanren can deal with politicians. As Japanese  society changes, donations to defend liberalism are losing their  significance. I hope politicians make elections less expensive  hereafter. Keidanren intends to launch a special committee on  business-politics relations, and to study foreign companies'  attitudes toward politics.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What, then, is your attitude toward  bureaucrats?    [Toyoda] Administrative reform is one of the most urgent  issues for Japan. Bureaucrats are supposed to take the  initiative in the reform process as they are fully aware of the  need for reform. They are capable of carrying out reform, and  they are well aware of the need for it. Deregulation must be  promoted, and it is absolutely necessary to provide the watchdog  body proposed by the so-called Hiraiwa Council. No matter who  takes over the government, this policy should remain unchanged.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Japan has lost the knack of constant  economic growth. As Keidanren chairman, what is your management  strategy?    [Toyoda] All companies have to keep maturing, and so does a  nation. The bubble-economy boom should not be revived, but we  must seek ways to improve society. If we stop, we will fall  behind international competitors. Although Japan is going to  have an aged society, it should not lose its vitality.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Officials of Keidanren are often called  "private bureaucrats" for their high-handed attitudes. What are  you going to do to reform Keidanren itself?    [Toyoda] Society is changing, and Keidanren must try harder  to catch up with social trends. We have to think about  organizational reform, and our officials should be modestly  capable people.</p>

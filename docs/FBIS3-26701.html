			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Changsha, February 5 (XINHUA) -- Chinese scientists  have developed a power supply system for computer-controlled  switchboards.    The new development, under the name of "Yinhe (milk way)  power supply system for computer-monitoring, unmanned and  computer-controlled telephone switchboards", has passed a state  technical appraisal in this capital of central China's Hunan  Province.    The system, China's first of its kind, was developed by  researchers with the China National Defense Science and  Technology University based in Changsha, the Hunan Provincial  Posts and Telecommunications Research Institute and the Changsha  Rixin Electrical Appliance Plant.    Previously, China relied heavily on similar imported power  supply systems for its posts and telecommunications sector.  Such foreign products were not only expensive but also  inconvenient to repair. Some of the imported ones do not have a  computer-monitoring function.    Experts from the appraisal group say that some technical  functions of the newly-developed system have reached  international advanced standards, while the price is two-thirds  that of the imported ones.</p>

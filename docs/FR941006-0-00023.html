			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In regulating rapid growth, the rapid growth rule in part overlaps both the FDIC's brokered deposit regulation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12 CFR 337.6, and its prompt corrective action regulation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12 CFR 308.200  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and 325.101  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  With the rescission of the rapid growth rule, the brokered deposit and prompt corrective action regulations are now the principal means by which rapid growth will be regulated. In deciding whether to rescind the rapid growth rule, the FDIC examined the rationale and history behind all three regulations, to see if the FDIC's safety-and-soundness concerns will be satisfied without the rapid growth rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rapid growth rule, adopted in 1990, replaced a regulation that called for the reporting of fully insured brokered deposits and fully insured deposits placed directly by other depository institutions. In the preamble to the proposed rapid growth rule, the FDIC stated that its intention was to broaden the prior regulation's focus from brokered deposits to other funding of rapid growth, including brokered deposits: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Since a bank may obtain its funding from a variety of sources in addition to brokered deposits, the FDIC believes that any effort to monitor and control rapid growth in insured banks should not focus solely or even principally on brokered deposits. Instead, the focus should be on rapid growth  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> per se <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  as an indication of the need for close monitoring and supervisory oversight. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> 54 FR 13693, April 5, 1989. The proposed rapid growth rule stated that <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> An insured bank may not undertake any special funding plan or arrangement designed to increase its assets by more than nine percent during any consecutive three-month period without first notifying the appropriate FDIC regional director for supervision in writing at least 30 days in advance of the implementation of the special funding plan or arrangement. For purposes of this requirement, a special funding plan or arrangement is any effort to rapidly increase the assets of the bank by any means. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  at 13695. The final rule changed the 9 percent to 7.5 percent, making the rule more stringent in that respect, but it narrowed the scope of the rule by making the notice necessary only if there was 7.5 percent growth resulting from one or more of the following activities: (1) The solicitation and acceptance of fully insured deposits obtained from or through the mediation of brokers or affiliates (which would include insured brokered deposits); (2) the solicitation of fully insured deposits outside a bank's normal trade area (this category would also include some insured brokered deposits); or (3) secured borrowings, including repurchase agreements. Thus, while it is not the sole aim of the rapid growth rule to curb the rapid growth that may result from the acceptance of brokered deposits, controlling a bank's acceptance of brokered deposits is one of the primary aims of that rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although the rapid growth rule was not mandated by any statute, the history of the present brokered deposit regulation involves two statutes, the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA). In 1989, FIRREA amended the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act), prohibiting an undercapitalized institution from accepting funds obtained, directly or indirectly, by or through any deposit broker for deposit into one or more deposit accounts except upon specific application to, and waiver of the prohibition by, the FDIC. Section 224 of FIRREA, adding section 29 to the FDI Act, 12 U.S.C. 1831f. In addition to deposits obtained through the mediation of third-party brokers, the definition of ``brokered deposits'' included deposits on which an institution offers or has agreed to pay rates of interest that are ``significantly'' higher than the prevailing rates of interest offered by other depository institutions with the same type of charter in the first institution's normal market area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two years later, the FDI Act was amended again. This time, FDICIA rewrote section 29 of the Act to restrict  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the acceptance of brokered deposits by certain institutions on the basis of their capital levels. Section 301 of FDICIA, amending section 29 of the FDI Act and adding section 29A thereto, 12 U.S.C. 1831f, 1831f&hyph;1. According to FDICIA and the brokered deposit regulation implementing it, 12 CFR 337.6, undercapitalized institutions may not accept brokered deposits at all, and adequately capitalized institutions must obtain a waiver from the FDIC before they can accept brokered deposits. Further, FDICIA limits the interest rates which adequately capitalized institutions can pay on brokered deposits. Well-capitalized insured depository institutions, however, can accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits without first obtaining a waiver from the FDIC, and without being limited in the interest rates they can pay.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

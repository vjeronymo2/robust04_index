			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / International Bonds: Borrowers kept on sideline by interest rate hopes ONLY a handful of Eurobond issues surfaced yesterday, as the international bond market took a breather after several weeks of heavy new-issue activity. Expectations that the Bundesbank would cut leading interest rates at its fortnightly meeting on Thursday kept borrowers on the sidelines, syndicate managers said. However, new-issue activity is expected to pick up again quickly, with the market waiting for the Province of Ontario's first global Canadian dollar bond issue later this week. The province expects to raise a minimum of CDollars 1bn through the issue, which is likely to have a maturity of 10 years and a yield spread of around 90 basis points above comparable Canadian government bonds. However, a decline in swap spreads in the Canadian dollar market has caused other potential issuers of Canadian dollar Eurobonds to reconsider their options, syndicate managers said. Among yesterday's issues, ABN Amro Bank led a seven-year guilder Eurobond issue for itself, raising the amount to Fl 1bn from Fl 750m due to good demand. The bonds, which carry a coupon of 6 5/8 per cent, were priced to yield 17.5 basis points above the 9 per cent Dutch government bonds due 2000. When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread narrowed slightly. An official at ABN Amro said the issue had been placed by mid-afternoon, mainly with institutions and banks in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium, Luxembourg and Austria. He added that the bonds had been pitched at the seven-year area of the yield curve where supply was scarce. Recent guilder issues have been concentrated in the 10-year area. Elsewhere, the Council of Europe re-opened its 9 per cent Ecu1bn Eurobond issue due 2001 and raised a further Ecu100m. The original issue was launched in November 1991. The new tranche was priced at 106.30 to yield 7.96 per cent. When the bonds were freed to trade, the price rose to 106.40 to yield 7.94 per cent. An official at the lead manager, Goldman Sachs, said that the Council of Europe had been looking to re-open the issue for some time and that it had made sense to lock into current rates in view of the recent strength in the Ecu market. Goldman Sachs also arranged a four-year Y30bn Eurobond issue for Mitsui Fudosan Company, Japan's largest commercial real estate developer. The bonds, which carry a coupon of 4.3 per cent, were sold around par, within total fees of 1 5/8 per cent. They were mainly placed with investors in the Asia Pacific region. Late in the day, Electricite de France re-opened its FFr3bn zero-coupon Eurobond issue for the second time, and raised a further FFr1bn. The original issue of FFr2bn was launched in November 1991 and was increased by FFr1bn in November 1992. The new tranche was priced at 49.50 to yield five basis points above the 8 1/2 per cent OATs due 2002. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has raised more than half of its planned Ecu900m of borrowings for this year, Mr Rene Karsenti, treasurer, said yesterday. He added that the EBRD was looking closely at returning to the Ecu bond market, but that it could still achieve a lower all-in cost by borrowing in other currencies and swapping. The EBRD's average borrowing costs last year, after swaps, amounted to 40 basis points below Libor, with an average maturity of seven years.</p>

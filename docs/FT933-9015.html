			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Book Review: Where wimps meet superwomen Men's Changing Commitments to Family and Work By Kathleen Gerson Basic Books, Dollars 25, 366 pages WOMEN AND THE WORK/FAMILY DILEMMA By Deborah Swiss and Judith Walker Wiley, Dollars 24.95, 255 pages 'Hi, hon, I'm home,' announces Joe Blow, scooping his infant daughter to his chest as he enters the kitchen of his home in suburban Nowheresville, USA. 'Say,' he exclaims, 'you've scrubbed them dirty pans from last night. I said I'd do them, when I got a chance. But I've been so busy.' 'How long am I meant to wait, Joe?' interrupts Mary, his wife, as she dabs infant dribble from her stylish black business suit. 'They made the place look so dirty, so . . . untidy. 'And talking of busy,' she growls, 'I haven't exactly been sitting on my butt, Joe; I was up before you this morning, gave my presentation to the board this afternoon, rushed home to take the kids to the dentist and did the dishes.' 'Hey,' says Joe, grinning smugly as he pulls a six-pack of beer from the fridge, 'is it my fault you've got this crazy female obsession with tidiness? Now, hon, where's my dinner?' Mary pours a container of hot, E-Z-Cook, low-calorie, microwaved vegetable lasagne over his head. So ends another skirmish on the new frontier of western marital life - that dangerous, uncharted territory where couples grapple with the ramifications of one of the biggest social changes of the past three decades - the entry into the workforce of a large percentage of the married female population. In the US, about 67 per cent of mothers are now employed or looking for work  -a radical change from the 1950s, when bread-winning husbands and stay-at-home wives made up roughly two-thirds of American households. Yet, as both these books point out, western culture and social institutions have hardly begun to reflect these changes. 'The unspoken assumption persists that there is still a woman at home to raise the children and manage the household,' say Swiss and Walker. Husbands are not keen to swap the power and freedom their breadwinning fathers enjoyed for greater family involvement. Wives struggle to be 'superwoman', combining the domestic role their mothers trained them to assume, and the demands of a job. The business world, while just starting to pay attention to work/family issues, generally buttresses these positions: men who take time off for family matters tend to be viewed as wimps. Women who do so risk being branded 'mommy trackers' - second-class beings who lack the corporate commitment needed to get to the top. These books examine life on this frontier, though from very different perspectives. Swiss and Walker, professional consultants in the work/family field, interviewed female Harvard graduates, to see how some of the 'brightest and best' of America's new generation of professional women were coping with the demands of home and family. The answer: with difficulty. The book explodes the myth that a modern professional woman can 'have it all' - a career and family - without suffering considerable physical and psychological stress. They conclude that the 'glass ceiling' which prevents women reaching the top because of their sex is 'buttressed by a maternal wall - a transparent but very real barrier that significantly hinders a mother's ability to balance successfully work and family'. The husband's changing role is the subject explored by Kathleen Gerson, an associate professor of sociology at New York University, in a book which is long and ponderous, yet original in subject matter and mercifully free of jargon. She maintains that men are growing confused about their position. 'As women have become almost as likely as men to shoulder the responsibilities of supporting a family, it has become harder for men to defend and justify advantages based solely on being born male. The demise of a cultural consensus on the meaning of manhood has left men in a no-man's land, searching for new meanings and definitions of maturity.' Her book, based on interviews with American men from all social backgrounds, argues that men are responding in different ways, with many seeking to hold on to their traditional breadwinner privileges, but others taking on varying degrees of involvement with their families. However, even the most involved fathers still tend to evade what they consider the routine, dirty work of childcare. Both books argue that companies need to be more flexible in allowing employees to balance the demands of work and home. But the vast majority of US companies, while playing lip service to family issues, would rather not get involved - and for good reasons: they view this as a private, individual matter, fear discriminating against employees with no families, or worry that greater provisions will hurt their bottom line. They also note that, however flexible a corporation's policies, many women who can afford to quit work still do so after giving birth, feeling that their offspring need greater parental guidance than a child-minder can give. Of course, a man could provide such guidance. But western culture has yet to accept the idea of the house-husband, not least because of economics: men are still generally paid much more than women, so in a one-income family it makes sense for the man to work. As Gerson points out: 'Women cannot enjoy equal employment opportunites until men shoulder equal family obligations, and men are not likely to become equal partners until women enjoy equal economic opportunities.' In other words, true equality will be a very long time coming.</p>

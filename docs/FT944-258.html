			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Milton Keynes Tec and chamber merge The Milton Keynes Chamber of Commerce and the Milton Keynes and North Buckinghamshire Training and Enterprise Council have merged in a move aimed at streamlining business services and training on a local level. The move is the first of its kind, though it is understood that at least 10 other chambers and Tecs - the employer-led bodies which administer government-funded training in England and Wales - are considering similar partnerships. The merged body will pool the memberships and provide the central services that were administered by both individual bodies.</p>

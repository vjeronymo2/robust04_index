			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 14 Apr (NA)--President Carlos Menem  today reaffirmed that the results of the 10 April election was a  Peronist victory and urged his government team "to not waver in  pursuing the charge" against corruption.    In an impromptu message delivered before the start of a  cabinet meeting, Menem said that through the results obtained in  the 10 April election the government "achieved its political  objective regarding constitutional reform," which would enable  him to seek reelection.    Upon accrediting "the government" with raising the banners  of  the fight against corruption, Menem warned that these banners  "should not fall into the hands of those who would use them  exclusively for election-oriented purposes." He was thus  tacitly alluding to the successful campaign and victory of the  Grand Front in the federal capital.    Menem, who asked for "applause" for Communications Secretary  Raul Burzaco on his birthday, reaffirmed that "Justicialism has  obtained a comfortable victory in the election of delegates for  the Constituent Assembly."    According to government sources, Menem attributed the  Justicialist setback in the federal capital "to the historically  proven volatile nature of the federal capital voters," who cast  their vote "in accordance with historical circumstances."    Commenting to his ministers on the reason for the decline in  ballots cast in this election for the Justicialist Party  compared to those of 1993, Menem said that this was due to "the  special nature" of the 10 April elections. He noted that on 10  April "the ballots were not being cast to elect executive branch  or legislative officials" nor were they intended to decide the  economic course. Hence, he said, "small parties were able to  capture more votes."    Underlining the importance of the Justicialist victory, he  noted that the Justicialist Party won in "123 of the 127  districts" in Buenos Aires Province and "in all of the 31  districts" in Santa Fe Province.    Menem also emphasized the success of the Justicialist Party  by affirming that "75 percent of the Constituent Assembly  delegates elected nationwide belong to parties that voted in  Congress in favor of the constitutional reform."    Finally, and before going on to the cabinet agenda, Menem  urged his ministers to continue "to work as usual" and put aside  "any pessimistic approach toward the electoral outcome."</p>

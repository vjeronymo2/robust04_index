			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Kuchma shows his true colours: Ukraine's new leader is ready to embrace market reforms During the cold war, it was a truism of US politics that only Republican leaders, with their impeccable anti-communist credentials, had the clout to negotiate with the Soviets. In a Ukrainian version of this political axiom, Mr Leonid Kuchma, the president-elect who is to be inaugurated tomorrow, appears ready to implement policies which, under a different leader, would provoke the fiercest outcry from his own constituencies. He was swept into office last weekend through the pro-Russian and communist vote, and is setting himself up as a free marketeer, a defender of the new republic and a cautious friend to Russia. Mr Kuchma is a farm-boy from central Ukraine who made his career in the Russian-speaking defence industry but is increasingly reverting to the Ukrainian language of his childhood. The new president has a far greater ambivalence towards Russia than romantic proponents of Slavic brotherhood in Moscow, or his Russian-speaking supporters at home, might wish. He sees the Ukraine's economic future as closely tied to Russia's fortunes and he aims to create 'a Euro-Asia common market'. Mr Kuchma intends to tear down trade barriers between Ukraine and its largest market, viewing Russia as a potential economic partner rather than a still clawed, recently ousted, overlord. Even so, Mr Kuchma and his advisers retain what many Ukrainians would see as a healthy wariness of mother Russia. One of the new president's top economic aides (an ethnic Russian entrepreneur) bustled through the campaign headquarters serving as Mr Kuchma's temporary office with a tale of Russian 'spies' who had already visited him. Mr Kuchma is also committed to hold on to the contested Crimean peninsula. It 'is now a part of Ukraine and will stay that way'. He points out that it 'voted for the new Ukrainian president.' The new leader's confidants admit that the hard-headed industrialist has 'a romantic side; this is a man who strums the guitar in his free time'. Some observers have feared that this sentimental streak might extend to a belief that the old days of cheap Russian fuel might return, given a sufficiently accommodating government in Kiev. But his tenure as prime minister, while Russia was jacking up oil prices almost to world market levels, appears to have cured Mr Kuchma of this nostalgia. 'Of course, Russia won't sell us oil and gas at subsidised rates,' Mr Kuchma says, lecturing on the rules of the free market as though to a dim pupil. 'That's how the market works - no-one sells anything more cheaply than he has to.' The new president realises that closer economic ties with Russia are no panacea - a harsh reality which Mr Kuchma did not often share with his voters. The fledgling administration will struggle to find more viable economic solutions. Ukrainian bureaucrats, many of them hand-picked for their loyalty to the out-going president, Mr Leonid Kravchuk, are only reluctantly releasing information to the new administration. Each new revelation makes the Kuchma team more depressed. The new man has inherited a debt-laden government with no official budget and outstanding promised credits - which Mr Kuchma says he will try to block - which could trigger a new round of inflation. It also has a huge debt to Russia and Turkmenistan for oil and gas. He still cherishes warm memories of the old days when heavy industry, including the missile factory he managed, was the pride of Soviet industry, but Mr Kuchma appears to have decided that market reforms are the only solution. He hopes to meet Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, as soon as possible and has already met the US ambassador twice as part of his bid to secure the Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn) promised to Ukraine by the Group of Seven industrialised countries if it begins reforms. Mr Kuchma realises, though, that western aid can alleviate no more than slightly the pain of economic transition. 'Between 20 and 25 per cent of our factories must be closed down. They are barely operating and what they do produce they sell to themselves,' Mr Kuchma says. 'Our main task now is to figure out how to transfer state factories to private ownership.' That sounds promising but, as Mr Kuchma himself is the first to admit, as the leader of the country with one of the worst economic records in what was the Soviet Union, he has a credibility problem. 'We've had so many programmes already, I don't even want to talk about mine. Now is the time just to do it.' First, Mr Kuchma must assemble a government and take control of the state. He appears to be vetting the reformist credentials of current and future cabinet members: Mr Roman Shpek, economy minister and the most progressive figure in the old government, will stay. Mr Viktor Iushchenko, chairman of the national bank, will need to explain to the new president 'why he did not more forcefully fulfill his mission to defend the national currency' if he wants to keep his job. Mr Kuchma says he will let the new prime minister stay on initially - 'I met him and he seems to be a reformer' - but the president-elect wryly admits, 'I do not expect passionate embraces' from parliament, which is dominated by hard-line leftists. Mr Kravchuk ruled Ukraine through an agile series of political manoeuvres, at the expense of a clear political agenda. Mr Kuchma, accustomed to the disciplined obedience of the Soviet defence industry, is by nature inclined to a very different sort of leadership. The first stages of his administration will show whether his commitment to reform Ukraine's economy and create an effective, but not subservient, relationship with Russia survive in the often brutal and inchoate world of Ukrainian politics.</p>

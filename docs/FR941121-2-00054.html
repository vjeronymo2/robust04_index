Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Approximately $30 million has been awarded to over 100 State, Tribal, and regional organizations under EPA's multimedia pollution prevention grant program, since its inception in 1989. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In November 1990, the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 (the Act) (Pub. L. 101&hyph;508) was enacted, establishing as national policy that pollution should be prevented or reduced at the source whenever feasible. Section 6603 of the Act defines source reduction as any practice that: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Reduces the amount of any hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant entering any waste stream or otherwise released into the environment (including fugitive emissions) prior to recycling, treatment, or disposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Reduces the hazards to public health and the environment associated with the release of such substances, pollutants, or contaminants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA further defines pollution prevention as the use of other practices, that reduce or eliminate the creation of pollutants through: increased efficiency in the use of raw materials, energy, water or other resources, or protection of natural resources by conservation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 6605 of the Act authorizes EPA to make matching grants to States to promote the use of source reduction techniques by businesses. In evaluating grant applications, the Act directs EPA to consider whether the proposed State programs will:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Make technical assistance available to businesses seeking information about source reduction opportunities, including funding for experts to provide on-site technical advice and to assist in the development of source reduction plans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Target assistance to businesses for whom lack of information is an impediment to source reduction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Provide training in source reduction techniques. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to this grant making authority, the Act authorizes EPA to establish a national source reduction clearinghouse, expands EPA's authority to collect data to better track source reduction activities, and requires EPA to report periodically to Congress on EPA's progress in implementing the Act.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Availability of FY 95 Funds <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With this publication, EPA is announcing the availability of approximately $5 million in grant/cooperative agreement funds for FY 1995. The Agency has delegated grant making authority to the EPA Regional offices which formally transfers the decision-making and awarding process for the PPIS grants to the Regions. Regional offices have responsibility for the solicitation of interest, screening of proposals, and the actual selection of awards. This seventh round of awards reflects a more direct and active Regional role in determining FY '95 awardees. PPIS grant guidance will be developed separately by each Regional program and will be provided to all applicants along with any supplemental information the Regions may wish to provide. However, in addition to Regional guidelines, all applicants must address the national requirements listed under unit III.3. of this document. Interested applicants should contact their Regional Pollution Prevention Coordinator for more information.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Eligibility <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the Act, eligible applicants for purposes of funding under this grant program include the 50 States, the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any territory or possession of the United States, any agency or instrumentality of a State including State universities and all Federally-recognized Indian tribes. For convenience, the term ``State'' in this notice refers to all eligible applicants. Local governments, private universities, private non-profit entities, private businesses, and individuals are not eligible. These organizations excluded from applying directly are encouraged to work with eligible applicants in developing proposals that include them as participants in the projects. EPA strongly encourages this type of cooperative arrangement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Catalogue of Federal Domestic Assistance <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The number assigned to the PPIS program is 66.708 (formerly 66.900). Organizations receiving pollution prevention grant funds are required to match Federal funds by at least 50 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, the Federal government will provide half of the total allowable cost of the project, the State half of the total allowable cost of the project. A grant request for $100,000 would support a total allowable project cost of $200,000, with the State also providing $100,000. State contributions may include dollars, in-kind goods and services and/or third party contributions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Eligible activities <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . In general, the purpose of the PPIS grant program is to support the establishment and expansion of State, Regional, Tribal, or local multimedia pollution prevention programs. EPA specifically seeks to build State pollution prevention capabilities or to test, at the State level, innovative pollution prevention approaches and methodologies. Funds awarded under the PPIS grant program must be used to support pollution prevention programs that address the transfer of potentially harmful pollutants across all environmental media: Air, water, and land. Programs should reflect comprehensive and coordinated pollution prevention planning and implementation efforts State- or Region-wide and where appropriate seek to address State environmental justice issues. States might focus on, for example: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Developing multimedia pollution prevention activities, including but not limited to: Providing direct technical assistance to businesses; collecting and analyzing data to target outreach and technical assistance opportunities; conducting outreach activities; developing measures to determine progress in pollution prevention; and identifying regulatory and non-regulatory barriers and incentives to pollution prevention and developing plans to implement solutions, where possible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Institutionalizing multimedia pollution prevention as an environmental management priority, establishing prevention goals, developing strategies to meet those goals, and integrating the pollution prevention ethic within both governmental and non-governmental institutions of the State or region. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Initiating demonstration projects that test and support innovative pollution prevention approaches and methodologies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Coordination of pollution prevention activities <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The Federal government has extended and broadened its support of organizations that supply technical assistance, training and information to businesses. Examples of this include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Resources from the Department of Commerce's National Institute for Standards and Technology to support the Manufacturing Extension Partnerships. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Resources from the Small Business Administration and EPA to support the technology assistance programs of the Small Business Development Centers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Resources from the Department of Energy to the industrial sector to assist in commercializing technologies developed from the national labs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. Resources from EPA and State programs that support the Clean Air Act Small Business Assistance Programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There is a growing emergence of business assistance organizations established within States to address the vast array of environmental concerns. Consequently, as a means to provide substantive support of pollution prevention, EPA is eager to ensure that the PPIS grants will add to the success and sustainability of these State pollution prevention programs. Therefore, it is important to clarify the role of the State pollution prevention program in terms of its relationship to its intended customers and to the other organizations which provide similar environmental assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on this, EPA has developed three mandatory requirements which must be addressed by all eligible applicants. Proposals that do not address these national requirements, even though they adequately address the Regional criteria, will not be considered eligible for funding. In the narrative of the grant application, the following three requirements must be addressed:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Briefly define the capacity and potential of the State program as a provider of pollution prevention assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Identify other organizations at the regional, State and local level, that provide similar environmental assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Describe the coordination capabilities with the identified environmental assistance programs:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Briefly describe an approach to working with, leveraging and complementing the identified organizations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Address the barriers for coordination with these organizations and options to overcome the identified barriers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposals accepted for review under this program must qualify as pollution prevention as defined by EPA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Program management <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Underground laboratory urged for Sellafield A rock laboratory should be built as soon as possible, 650 metres underground, to establish whether the area around Sellafield in Cumbria is suitable for the deep disposal of radioactive wastes, the Royal Society said yesterday. The recommendation from the society, Britain's senior scientific body, comes in a report on the activities of Nirex, the nuclear industry's waste disposal company. Although Nirex commissioned the study, it was carried out independently by the society. It concludes: 'The society retains an open mind on whether Sellafield can meet the safety criteria for a UK deep repository.' If the site is suitable, the society adds, the nuclear industry should consider depositing its most radioactive 'high-level waste' there, as well as the low-level and intermediate-level waste Nirex is considering. Nirex yesterday distanced itself from that proposal, aware that it could inflame public opposition to the project. It said: 'Nirex has no remit for high-level waste and the repository is not being designed to accept it.' The Pounds 120m rock laboratory would help to establish whether the area's geology is suitable for keeping radioactive materials isolated for tens of thousands of years. Sir Alan Muir Wood, who chaired the Royal Society study group, conceded that Nirex appeared to have chosen Sellafield for political reasons - because it was already a nuclear site. He said: 'It is unlikely that Sellafield would have been first choice on geological features alone.' The report recommends that the repository should be built in two stages. The first would be for short-lived wastes whose radioactivity would die away within a few hundred years. The second would be an extension into deeper geological strata - below 1,000 metres - where there is less risk of radioactivity reaching the surface and where long-lived wastes could be stored. Nirex reacted warily to that proposal too. Deeper drilling and tunnelling would not only increase costs but also increase the safety risks to construction workers, it said. Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, the environmental groups, said that the recommendations could not be justified by the scientific evidence. Disposal of Radioactive Wastes.

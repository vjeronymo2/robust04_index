			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Strong demand takes Kuala Lumpur to peak OPTION-related selling depressed share prices in the morning session, but a later rise in the futures market prompted arbitrage buying, and the Nikkei average finally closed moderately higher ahead of the three-day weekend, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei rose 113.01 to 20,378.64, 0.5 per cent up on the week, after a low of 20,180.02 and a high of 20,405.04. Prices lost ground on selling related to the settlement of October options contracts. The index rose in the last 30 minutes of trading on arbitrage linked buying. Volume totalled 320m shares against 297m. Advances led declines by 532 to 438 with 198 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks closed up 9.61 at 1,656.40 and, in London, the ISE Nikkei 50 index rose 2.6 to close at 1287.21. Traders sold small-capital stocks included in the Nikkei 225 index ahead of an announcement of a new capitalisation weighted index by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun after the market closed. Speculation that the new Nikkei index would be similar to the capitalisation weighted Topix index prompted buying of Topix components. After the market closed, the new Nikkei index, composed of 300 stocks, was announced. The Osaka stock exchange is expected to launch a futures contract on the new index in the near future. Some car makers were strong on hopes that they would become components of the new index. Mitsubishi Motors, which was included in the new benchmark, rose Y7 to Y839. On the other hand, small capital components of the Nikkei 225 lost ground. Toho Rayon fell Y21 to Y526 and Nitto Boseki declined Y6 to Y384. Both stocks were not included in the Nikkei 300. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 27.70 to 22,374.06 in volume of 13.7m shares. Dealers liquidate positions ahead of the long weekend, although the index recouped some of the losses on late buying. Roundup Many Pacific Rim markets paused for breath at the end of a high-performance week. KUALA LUMPUR was an exception, finding strong retail and institutional demand which took the composite index 10.28 ahead to a record high of 884.62, a 2.9 per cent gain on the week. The market took its lead from a MDollars 2 rise to MDollars 29 by Genting on continued talk of a floating casino deal. BANGKOK continued to move ahead in calmer trade as foreign and local institutions overcame the impact of selling by local individual investors of blue chips and large-capitalisation stocks. The SET index gained 10.12 to 1,098.64, 10.7 per cent higher on the week, with turnover still high at Bt16.4bn but dull in comparison with the record Bt26.9bn on Thursday. HONG KONG closed easier but off the day's lows in subdued trade with Chinese investors taking profits ahead of the weekend. The Hang Seng index, which had closed at record highs over the previous five sessions, ended 61.23 lower at 8,005.56, but this was still a 4.3 per cent advance on the week. Turnover shrank to HKDollars 3.86bn from HKDollars 6.59bn on Thursday. Blue chips fell across the board while Sun Hung Kai Properties slipped 50 cents to HKDollars 42.50 ahead of annual results due after the market closed. NEW ZEALAND weathered a morning bout of profit-taking and the NZSE 40 capital index finished 2.22 lower at 2,016.74 in heavy trading, still 3.9 per cent higher over the week. TAIWAN extended early losses to end lower across the board after profit-taking eroded Thursday's 2.1 per cent surge. The weighted index ended 31.75 lower at 3,863.19 in turnover of TDollars 15.48bn against Thursday's TDollars 18.99bn, for a 1.5 per cent rise on the week. Banking stocks were the heaviest losers, with Taipei Business Bank down TDollars 1.50 to TDollars 62.50. China Steel sank 40 cents to TDollars 17.70. MANILA moved ahead on the strength of blue chips and the composite index added 21.68 to 1,982.72, 1.2 per cent higher on the week. SEOUL took time to consolidate in the absence of news to drive the market and the composite index edged 3.24 lower to 714.58 for a 0.7 per cent fall on the week. SINGAPORE drifted easier with Malaysian speculative issues continuing to fuel market activity amid rumours of corporate restructuring and takeovers. The Straits Times Industrial index eased 5.96 to 2,031.45, for a 0.6 per cent rise over the week.</p>

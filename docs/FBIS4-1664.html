			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by reporter Liu Xuanwu (0491 6693 2976): "A </F> Look at Our Province's Foreign Contacts by Looking At How It  Utilizes Foreign Investment"]    [Text] Last year, our province's aggregate volume of  contractual investment totaled $1.4 billion, the largest amount  since the introduction of reform and opening up. The newly  approved projects included 1,039 foreign-funded enterprises, and  the contractual volume of investment was $700.2 million,  exceeding the figures of the past nine years combined.  Investors came from 33 countries and regions. After Maanshan  Iron and Steel Company's H shares were listed in Hong Kong, they  attracted many overseas buyers because of the company's powerful  economic strength and good reputation. A total of $500 million  in stocks was sold. This was a new step by our province in  utilizing foreign capital. In addition, some foreign capital  was also used by the methods of borrowing from foreign banks and  foreign governments, conducting compensatory trade, and  processing products from materials imported from abroad.  Furthermore, last year our province also accepted $16 million in  foreign aid. As a whole, our province's utilization of foreign  capital is entering a new period as the channels, methods, and  scale for its utilization are expanding.    The arrival of this new period shows that the scope and  channels of our contacts are expanding, that more people in the  world are beginning to understand and like Anhui, and that Anhui  is advancing in big strides in the world arena.    In opening up to the outside world, it is necessary, to a  large extent, to expand contacts and ties with various  countries. The contacts and ties should include those in the  economic, scientific, technological, educational, cultural, and  personnel areas. However, these contacts should, finally, be  based on economic contacts and should be embodied by economic  interests and benefits. How should we expand our province's  contacts and ties with foreign countries? From a long-range  point of view, an important thing we should do is to use and  manage foreign capital well and strive to constantly increase  its value and make it yield benefits.    The purpose of foreign businessmen who invest in our  province  is to make money, and it is because there are profits to be made  that we introduce foreign capital. This is reasonable.  Cooperation and contacts with foreign businessmen will continue  to consolidate and develop only if both sides can profit. There  is a humorous saying by the people of Hefei which goes like  this: When foreign businessmen get rich, we also get rich; both  sides "will get fat if they cooperate." Therefore, we must not  fear that foreign businessmen will make money; instead, we  should create conditions for them to make money. This is an  "economic chain" which leads to expansion of contacts and  enhancement of friendship. Many practical situations have shown  that if foreign businessmen who have invested in our province  fail to make money in two to three years, they will lose  interest in our province. Besides, this will adversely affect  investment by other foreign businessmen in our province. If  their capital increases in value quickly and if the projects  built with their aid yield profits, they will show greater  interest in cooperating with us. Besides, this has also  increased our confidence and attracted more people who are  willing to invest in Anhui and to cooperate with and aid us.  For example, at first foreign businessmen invested only several  hundred thousand U.S. dollars in some foreign-funded enterprises  such as the Zhongyuan Shoes Manufacturing Company, Limited, in  Jieshou and the Hongqing Precision Machine Tool Plant in Anqing.  Before long, the value of the U.S. dollars increased like  nuclear fission in Anhui, turning the two enterprises into  pacesetters in cooperation with foreign businesses. Later,  under the influence of the pacesetters, many more foreign  businesses came to invest in Anhui.  Having achieved great successes, the Huabei [North China] plain  agricultural project, the first project of Anhui's agricultural  sector that introduced foreign investment, became a banner of  China's agricultural sector in introducing foreign investments.  It attracted one batch after another of larger foreign-invested  agricultural projects. The successes achieved by the Anhui  Provincial XINHUA Printing Factory in implementing a project  with German assistance also caught the attention of some  overseas personages. All these showed that successful  utilization and management of foreign investments as well as  projects with foreign assistance is an important step in  expanding contacts with the outside world, attracting more  foreign investment, and achieving greater successes.    There are many institutions in Anhui that have made good use  of foreign funds. However, there are also some localities that  often think the job is finished after foreign funds are  introduced. They do not spend the time and effort to use and  manage foreign funds. As a result, the value of foreign funds  fails to increase quickly, thereby adversely affecting the  expansion of cooperation and contacts with the outside world.  Actually, the introduction of foreign funds is only the  beginning of the job. More difficult work lies ahead. We must  establish highly efficient operating mechanisms step by step for  the three kinds of partially or wholly foreign- owned  enterprises and for other projects under cooperation with  foreign businessmen so as to really give full play to the role  of introduced foreign funds as a yeast. Some localities in our  province are handling the task now. For example, the Hefei City  Government last year established an "office responsible for  providing services to foreign-owned enterprises," called  "Foreign- Owned Enterprises Office" for short, in addition to  its "Foreign Funds Office." After the "Foreign Funds Office"  has introduced foreign funds, the "Foreign-Owned Enterprises  Office" will be specifically responsible for the establishment  of the three kinds of partially or wholly foreign-owned  enterprises, for providing services and coordination for them,  and for their administration and supervision. It created  conditions for highly efficient operation of the three kinds of  partially or wholly foreign-owned enterprises. Such a practice  is recommendable.    At present, the spring tide of reform and opening is surging  from coastal areas to the hinterland; our province is benefiting  from the development strategy for areas along the Chang Jiang;  more foreign businessmen will commit investments in Anhui. In  the face of such an opportunity, we must greet it in a more  sincere attitude and with more solid work and better services so  we may establish more extensive contacts with the world.</p>

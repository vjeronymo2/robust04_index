Never before has the  United Nations had such acontroversial a leader.    And on this dark December afternoon, with large snowflakes  falling over New York on the eve of the new year, UN Secretary  General Butrus Butrus-Ghali is alert, provocative, and  pugnacious. He is full of ideas and vision which he discussed  energetically during the hour-long interview he gave while  seated on the leather sofa on the 38th floor of UN Headquarters.    As usual, he was dressed in a pin-stripe suit, but today his  eyes were more tired than usual. Butrus-Ghali has just returned  from a mission to North Korea, where he has been trying to  persuade Pyongyang to allow the United Nations to inspect  installations where it is suspected that nuclear arms are being  developed. In this his first interview since his visit to North  Korea Butrus-Ghali said that "the political will actually exists  to avoid an escalation of the nuclear arms conflict."    "It was a very fruitful visit. There is a crisis of such  proportions that a solution here would have an effect on the  spread of nuclear arms in the world. It is something positive  that there is a political will in both North and South Korea to  resolve the crisis using peaceful means.    "Whether North Korea has nuclear arms? I do not know. But  we have to have a swift solution since there are many people  interested in buying nuclear arms," Butrus-Ghali said, clearly  referring to countries like Iraq, Libya, and Pakistan.    The new idea which the UN chief has developed but which is  upsetting many UN countries and is causing many employees to  leave the world organization relates to the UN's future role of  "peace-enforcing" instead of "peacemaking" or "peacekeeping."  In simple terms this means that the United Nations would shoot  to create peace in conflict-torn countries. Somalia is an  example, but an unhappy one. In Somalia the United Nations used  military force in an attempt to enforce peace. But the  operation went awry, and many UN soldiers were killed as were  Somali civilians. But Butrus-Ghali still thinks that the idea  of greater militarization for the United Nations is a good one.    "If the power of the state in a country is divided, we need  to go in to replace the police in a country, as in Somalia.  And, if the narcotics mafia takes over in a country, it could  happen that the United Nations would go in and restore order,"  he said.    Asked whether the United Nations is to be some sort of world  policeman he replied gruffly:    "Who else would do the job?    "The UN countries should have national troops in readiness  for peace-enforcing and peacekeeping operations. This means  that within 24 hours I would be able to have 80,000 UN soldiers  ready," said the UN head, who believes that "80 percent of all  conflicts today are regional and could be resolved using a few  thousand men."    But the United Nations must combine the three strategies in  the future. The three missions of "peace-enforcing,  peacekeeping, and peacemaking" should go hand in hand, in  Butrus-Ghali's view. Once a peace has been enforced societies  and countries must be rebuilt, confidence must be created  between those in conflict, rivals must be disarmed, and  "preventive diplomacy" must be used to prevent new conflicts  before they break out. And here the United Nations will play  the main role.    But in the view of critics the three UN roles are  irreconcilable. If the United Nations starts to hunt the person  pointed out as the villain in a conflict, the United Nations  would also become part of the conflict -- something that  conflicts with the whole UN idea of objectivity and  impartiality. A vengeful "UN enemy" could select humanitarian  aid operations as a target for shelling.    The "villains" in the conflict are also needed in the  reconstruction of the country, but they are hardly likely to  want to work with a United Nations which has killed their men.  The arguments against "peace-enforcing" are being stacked up by  irritated UN countries which are asking with concern where their  almost 50-year-old peace organization is heading.    "Of course there are risks. But you have to accept the risk  of dying to defend peace. Nor can we provide humanitarian aid  without peace, and this is why peace must first be made. And  also, if a war continues, the need for humanitarian aid becomes  so much the greater."    Sweden's Jan Eliasson, assistant secretary general for the  UN  humanitarian aid operations, recently made headlines when he  decided to leave his post as one of Butrus-Ghali's closest  aides. It has been reported that two reasons for his resignation  are the UN head's ideas about soldiers instead of humanitarian  aid, and the difficulties of working with Butrus-Ghali who has  the reputation of being intolerant, despotic, and arrogant.    "No, no, no. There are no problems between us. Eliasson's  family was not happy here in New York and went back to Sweden.  Eliasson wants to be with his family. That is how simple things  are. There are no problems about working together. Naturally,  everybody has problems sometimes; that is only normal,"  Butrus-Ghali said brusquely.    He went on to patiently defend himself against the criticism  of his "dictatorial behavior" and of the UN headquarters as  "pharaoh's court."    "I think that things are working very well. I never reach  decisions without first discussing things very carefully with  others. Arrogant? That is a misreading of self-confidence," he  said, adding, not without some pride:    "Did anyone care about the United Nations three years ago?  Now the United Nations has become important. Perhaps the  United Nations has too much credibility nowadays, more than we  deserve," Butrus-Ghali said, explaining why he is a good UN head.    "I am an activist. I have a great deal of faith in the UN  system and have been writing books on the subject for more than  50 years. I am also proud of being physically able to cope with  this work load! But even if I am Superman and Einstein, I am  nothing without the help of the UN countries."    He said that the United Nations has radically increased its  peacekeeping operations from two to 22 over a few years, while  the budget for peacekeeping operations has only increased from  $1 billion to $4 billion, and UN staff numbers are the same as  before.    "This is my greatest success as UN secretary general. My  biggest failure is the economic crisis at the United Nations  which I will unfortunately not be able to resolve. Many  countries are refusing to pay until the UN administration is  reformed. Pay now, then we will reform!" Butrus-Ghali roared,  adding irritatedly that "the members paid billions during the  Cold War, but now they are not paying a penny to make the UN  more powerful. They are not prepared to give the United Nations  a new role."    In Butrus-Ghali's view, countries do not perceive the  threats  in the world in the same way as during the Cold War. Previously  there was a "black-and-white" situation with a well-defined  enemy that you had to defend yourself against.    "For the Soviet Union the enemy was capitalism, while the  Soviet Union was `the evil empire' for the Western world. Today  the threats are more diffuse and more difficult to explain to  public opinion. How do you explain that environmental damage  can harm the world more than a war, that ethnic wars are a  sickness which could infect the whole world, that a new type of  poverty in rich cities is growing, that the narcotics trade is  worth as much as defense during the Cold War, that AIDS is as  dangerous as the plague in the Middle Ages? These problems are  not producing the same involvement as during the Cold War," he  said.    "The problem with the problems is that we have far too many  problems at one and the same time."    The UN head takes the view that the rules in "the new  world" are still unclear, as is the future role of the United  Nations. Much is expected from the United Nations, but the UN  nations lack determination.    "Some countries want to give the United Nations a new role,  but they do not want to risk lives in peacekeeping operations.  Many countries are prepared to see their own soldiers fall in  defense of their homelands, but they have not understood that  their sons could also die to defend other countries!"  Butrus-Ghali also believes that increased globalization leads  to increased religious fundamentalism, not only among Muslims,  but also among Jews, Christians, and Hindus.    "People feel less secure in this age of increased  globalization. To feel more secure they go back to their  tribes, traditions, to old values. We have not succeeded in  finding a new ideology since the collapse of Marxism. When  everything collapsed a vacuum was formed -- and this is now  being filled by fundamentalism in different forms."    But in two countries things seem to have "collapsed" more  than in others. These are the former Yugoslavia and Somalia.  However, the UN head takes the view that the humanitarian  efforts in Bosnia have been successful, but that "on the other  hand we have not succeeded in finding a political solution." He  said that what is needed is "more patience, political  imagination, and persuasion."    "In Somalia the failure is limited to southern Mogadishu. In  95 percent of the country we have succeeded and famine has  decreased. What is important now is to achieve peace between the  various parties within a couple of months," the UN Head said  with a sigh.    The burden of responsibility lies heavy on his shoulders,  perhaps also because he never has time off, can never go to the  theater or relax. There is no such thing as leisure time in  Butrus-Ghali's life -- "that is one of my frustrations." If,  contrary to expectations, he were to take a holiday, "I sleep  all the time." But in 1995 he will have more time.  Butrus-Ghali has determined to retire after a term of five  years, in order to write more books.    "I do not want to continue after 1995. I will then be 74.  You cannot go on after that age without becoming senile. Let  us be practical."    After that, 10 to 20 years into the future, his dream is a  United Nations which is the world's "think tank."    "The ideal is a House of Reflection to which the UN  countries  will come and discuss long-term developments. Social  developments are accelerating more and more rapidly and we are  finding ourselves with new global problems. That is why we  should think about solutions to problems 20 year into the  future, but implement them now. But for this, a whole new  mentality is needed."</p>

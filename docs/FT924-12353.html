			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / SFO ends probe of Bank link to BCCI THE Serious Fraud Office said yesterday that it had found no evidence to support allegations of corruption involving three Bank of England officials and the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International. Allegations that BCCI managers had been seen 'palm greasing' three Bank of England officials with suitcases of money were made to Lord Justice Bingham's inquiry into BCCI and repeated in a parliamentary early-day motion laid by Mr Brian Sedgemoor, Labour MP for Hackney South and Shoreditch.</p>

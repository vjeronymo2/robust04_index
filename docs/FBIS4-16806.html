			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lyudmila Feliksova: "Chisinau and Tiraspol Seek </F> Compromise"]    [Text] Chisinau -- The eighth round of talks between the  Moldovan and Russian delegations on the 14th Army has been held  in Chisinau. In official language, this means organizing the  legal status and the procedure and timetable for the withdrawal  of the Russian military formations temporarily present in the  Republic of Moldova.    Despite the smiles and the correct formulas from the  delegation heads (Russia is represented by special envoy V.  Kitayev, while Moldova is represented by A. Tsaran [name as  transliterated], ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary),  judging by everything, the talks have been difficult. The main  point of difference has been the timetable for the withdrawal.  The Moldovan side, which had been insisting on July 1994, is  prepared to wait another year or two, while the Russian side,  without setting any precise timeframe, considers a longer period  to be more realistic.    There is one other point on which the sides were unable to  reach full mutual understanding. An agreement signed by the two  presidents -- Boris Yeltsin and Mircea Snegur -- stipulates the  principle of synchronizing the timetable for the 14th Army's  withdrawal with the adoption of legal status for the Dniester  Region. And, as the Russian side stressed, it is a question of  a joint accord, rather than a unilateral Russian initiative or  its interference in another state's internal affairs. But  Moldovan Ambassador Tsaran believes that the synchronization  principle has not proved its worth and has turned into a brake  on the negotiating process.    V. Kitayev expressed the conviction that the Dniester  problem  would be solved, and Russia is actively supporting the political  settlement process. As for the synchronization principle, from  his standpoint, it would be far more productive to conduct the  talks themselves rather than to complain about unsuitable  principles.    The question of creating a military base to replace the 14th  Army was not discussed. As for General Lebed and his political  activeness, E. Vorobyev, a Russian Defense Ministry spokesman,  said that the 14th Army commander is highly valued as a  professional and honest general, but people do not approve of  his predilection for various political statements. The 14th  Army's property -- which, judging by the edict from Dniester  Region President I. Smirnov, that region claims -- belongs to  Russia, and the Russian Foreign Ministry has issued an official  statement on this score.    But, on the whole, observers made a positive assessment of  the last round of talks. From their standpoint there was some  progress in this area. In particular, draft agreements on  questions of jurisdiction, mutual legal aid, and issues relating  to social guarantees for servicemen and pensions provision were  initialed. A jointly elaborated methodology for defining the  technical timetable for the withdrawal of troops and military  cargo from Moldovan territory has been signed. The next meeting  is planned for May.    Thus, new realities have emerged in the protracted talks. In  this connection our correspondent asked Georgiy Marakutsa,  chairman of the Dniester Region Supreme Soviet, to comment on  the current situation.    "The Dniester Region Supreme Soviet expressed its  attitude," he said, "in a statement which says that the results  of the elections to the Moldovan parliament and an opinion poll  show that there is a new sociopolitical situation in the  Republic, and that this makes it possible to hope for an end to  political extremism at state level.    "In the current Moldovan parliament Agrarians and Socialists  make up a bloc with which dialogue is possible. But I am not  expecting any immediate results. It will take time to rid  ourselves of national-patriotic euphoria and illusions, as well  as of the idea that the Dniester Republic was allegedly the  artificial fruit of a group of politicians.    "If we cite the will of the people, their view of our region  was expressed at the recent elections. Out of 485,000 voters  only 6,800 took part in the formation of the new Moldovan  parliament. International observers did not record a single  instance of any obstacles being erected on our part. Those who  wanted to vote could do so.    ``Some 1.5 percent made their choice, and that is their  right, but the rest of the population, by their failure to  participate in the elections, also expressed their will, thereby  confirming that the Dniester Republic was created by the people  rather than by individual politicians, as people in Chisinau  have been claiming hitherto. If the Moldovan leadership  realizes its mistake there is hope that there will be a  dialogue, although there will be many obstacles to it.    ``Chisinau is paying lip-service to the idea of the  indivisibility and integrity of Moldova, but in fact our  relations have long since moved to the level of interstate  relations. If we are one state, then why is a national currency  being unilaterally introduced, why are the balance of trade and  mutual transactions with us conducted as they would be with  Ukraine or Belarus? Or take the loans from the West -- of which  we have not received a single kopek. Who will repay them? All  of us together? We will not stand for that. Just name a single  country where internal relations are conducted on this basis.    ``M. Snegur's trip to Brussels to sign NATO's `Partnership  For Peace' program is further evidence of our separateness.  Moldova is seeking security guarantees there. Who from? From  Russia? Ukraine? Of course not. Wouldn't it be better to  choose another way -- self-demilitarization, as we have long  suggested?    ``In short, there are many issues. And they require  solution. We recognize the integrity of the Republic of Moldova  and its external borders, and we are prepared for any  compromises, but only up to a certain point. That point has  been defined -- the statehood of the Dniester Region.    ``This is not a whim or a caprice, it is not a question of  clinging on to power, as Chisinau makes out, rather it is the  only way to deal with our destiny in such a way as to ensure  that nobody is ever able -- irrespective of the changing  political weather in Chisinau -- to dictate terms to this  region. We will not retreat from statehood. Filling it with  content is another matter. This can be decided around the  negotiating table, and we are ready to sit down at it.''</p>

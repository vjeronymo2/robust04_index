			<p>BFN     [Text] A meeting to publicize a comprehensive plan for drug  control for the period from now to the year 2000 was held in  Vientiane on the morning of 16 May. The meeting was chaired by  Souban Salitthilat, deputy minister of foreign affairs and  chairman of the Lao National Committee for Narcotics Control.  It was attended by (Ms. Amerera Haq-perera), representative of  the United Nations Development Program, along with many  representatives from 10 northern provinces and representatives  of various ministries and departments concerned.    Souban Salitthilat noted drug addiction as a problem which  seriously threatens the world society at present. He said:  Drug addiction and trafficking have been widely expanded, thus  bringing about an adverse effect to the world. It is considered  a problem for which everyone must be jointly held responsible.  The deputy minister of foreign affairs noted: The Government  of the Lao People's Democratic Republic [LPDR] has regarded as  an important task the reduction of supply of opium and other  addictive plants. To achieve the said goal, the LPDR Government  has utilized all sources of funds totaling some $28 million from  various countries as well as from international organizations to  implement four projects in five provinces in the northern  region, such as the Pha Lavek project in Vientiane Province, the  Lao-American project in Houa Phan Province, and the rural  development projects in Xieng Khouang, Bokeo, and Luang Namtha  Provinces. At the same time, the government implemented a  strategy of persuading people who have earned their living on  slash-and-burn cultivation to switch to plains land to do rice  farming and plant other types of crops, which can bring about  higher revenues. This strategy can also help preserve the  environment.    Souban Salitthilat stressed: The Lao Government presently  has been prepared to cooperate, through every possible means,  with all countries and international organizations in solving  this problem on the basis of the principles of respecting each  other's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity and  mutual benefit. In cooperating with the UN Commission on  Narcotic Drugs, the Lao Government has adopted a comprehensive  narcotics control plan for implementation for the period from  now to the year 2000. Stipulated in the said plan are the  urgent needs as noted in the government's strategic plan,  policy, and (projects) for actual practice, including the  gradual reduction of poppy plantation; the elimination of the  planting of marijuana for commercial purposes; the reduction and  control of narcotics demand; the suppression and control of  illicit trading, production, and other illegal acts involving  narcotics; and working in cooperation with the world in dealing  with this problem.</p>

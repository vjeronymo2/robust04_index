			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NEW HAMPSHIRE;  </P> <P> SEABROOK PLANT'S LICENSING PROBED  </P> <P> The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is investigating whether its decision to  grant a full-power license for the Seabrook nuclear power plant was "corruptly  induced," agency documents say.  </P> <P> An Aug. 7 memo said the NRC inspector general's office was interviewing staff  members about Nov. 9, 1989, rulings by the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board.  The board recommended that the plant in Seabrook, N.H., receive a full-power  license and it approved evacuation plans. The action came just two days after  an NRC appeals board said it found four problem areas with the previously  approved evacuation plans. The NRC licensing board then ruled the four areas  not to be a problem.  </P></p>

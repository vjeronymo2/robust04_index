			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Core inflation rate continues to slide BRITAIN'S core inflation rate fell further last month, reflecting sluggish demand but supporting government hopes that upward pressure on prices will continue to ease. Figures from the Central Statistical Office show that in December the year-on-year rate of increase in prices of goods at the factory gate - the key measure of core inflation - was the lowest for 2 1/2 years. In December, prices at the factory gate were only 5 per cent higher than in December 1990, compared with a rise of 5.1 per cent in the 12 months to November. Although the figures provide little evidence of any immediate respite from the economic gloom, the government believes lower inflation will provide the platform for higher industrial investment and a recovery later this year. The latest data suggest many manufacturers are continuing to cut prices to maintain sales in a climate of fragile demand, while at the same time benefiting from lower raw material and wage costs. Stripping out volatile food, drink and tobacco prices, the output price index rose by 3.8 per cent in the year to December - the lowest rate recorded since February 1987 when the annual rise was also 3.8 per cent. It compares with highs of 6.5 per cent in January and February last year. Last month the cost of raw materials and fuel used by manufacturing industry fell by a seasonally adjusted 0.7 per cent against the previous month, after a 0.5 per cent rise in November. This left the price index of these materials down by 1 per cent on the year compared with a 0.4 per cent annual decline in November. The fall in the cost of raw materials and fuel reflects the weak demand for many types of commodities such as oil and metals. The price index for petroleum products fell by 1.6 per cent on the year, while metals fell by 0.3 per cent. Mr Gwyn Hacche, an economist at James Capel, said the fall in input prices should encourage industry as pressures on profit margins eased. The Treasury was heartened by the figures. It said they showed a continued reduction in underlying inflationary pressures in the UK economy. 'The producer prices numbers should feed into lower underlying retail price inflation in the months ahead,' a Treasury official said. The Confederation of British Industry welcomed the figures as evidence that the UK was 'genuinely achieving lower inflation than other European Community countries'.

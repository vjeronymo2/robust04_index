			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Public buying of land urged in Japan A campaign is gathering momentum for government assistance to clear Japanese banks' bad loans, as Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Keidanren, the leading business federation, yesterday proposed public funds be used for purchases intended to stimulate the property market. The banks' losses are linked to the price collapse of their property collateral, and fears are growing that the commercial property market will be in free fall next year unless the government intervenes to support prices. However, Mr Hiraiwa's call for intervention was aimed not only at banks, but also at the many non-financial companies which invested in property projects during the late 1980s, the so-called bubble era, and are facing huge losses. 'Now seems to be the right time for the government to consider buying up land,' Mr Hiraiwa said. His suggestion echoes proposals by other business leaders for the government to buy land for public use, and even to purchase property that will not ultimately be used for public purposes, if only to stimulate the market. The government is likely to consider advance land purchases as part of a stimulatory package, for which preparation is expected to begin this week. The Construction Ministry has indicated that it would like an easing of land transaction taxes, but the Finance Ministry is likely to oppose any measure that would reduce tax income. Banks complain they have been unable to sell land held as collateral because the property market is 'dead', while the rate of commercial vacancies in Tokyo is estimated at 10 per cent and rising. In areas developed rapidly during the bubble years, the vacancy rate is close to 50 per cent and the determination of developers to complete projects is still adding to the surplus of commercial space. Demand for residential property has risen this year, but a study by the Real Estate Companies' Association estimates that 81 per cent of apartment buyers in the Tokyo area in 1988-92 are sitting on large potential losses. The association calculates the average loss for an apartment bought in 1989 at Y12m (Pounds 73,500). This rises to Y22m for an apartment bought in 1990 and Y18m for a 1991 apartment.</p>

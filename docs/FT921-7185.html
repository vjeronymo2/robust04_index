			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Ministers prepare hard line on EC transport policy MINISTERS are preparing to take a tough stance over transport policy when the government assumes the presidency of the European Community in the summer. If the Conservatives win the general election, they will resist any attempts to water down transport liberalisation measures. Ministers are also concerned about the European Commission's planned 'white paper' setting out transport policy beyond this year. It is expected to be published early in the presidency and there are fears it will not prove liberal enough. Britain's presidency will mark the deadline for completion of the single market, but the government is anxious not to allow draft proposals in areas such as aviation and shipping cabotage to be diluted or gradually phased in so they lose their impact. In the government's view, after completion of the single market, the aim should be to create a more rigorous competition policy by intensifying the application of competition rules and state aid. The white paper is, however, likely to be in terms of 'sustainable mobility' with strong emphasis on the social and environmental dimensions. Though the tasks for the government will depend to some extent on the progress made during the Portuguese presidency, officials think it unlikely that measures on aviation will be fully agreed by the end of June, and are also expecting to have to deal with road haulage. Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, said that a backlog of transport measures had built up as attention had focused on economic and political union in the approach to the Maastricht summit. The commission, he said, was concerned that matters which should be uncontroversial - such as an EC role in planning an integrated transport policy - would fail to make progress if a Tory administration held the presidency. Tension is also likely to arise over the issue of what should replace the arrangements for infrastructure planning and financing at EC level, which expire at the end of the year. The government is likely to seek to scale down proposals for EC funding for transport infrastructure, for example by emphasising the potential for using private rather than public financing. It may, however, express some sympathy for the EC having a role in supplying feasibility studies. Other priorities for the presidency include an initiative on improving vehicle safety standards. The government also intends to take action on transport for disabled people, with the aim of broadening the proposals beyond the mobility of disabled workers alone.</p>

			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Chauffeurs driven off the road HOME, James. And don't bother to come back tomorrow. More than 1,000 uniformed drivers are looking for work in London alone, according to Britain's leading domestic staff agencies. Demand for chauffeurs has collapsed to a five-year low as companies and private individuals cut spending, and there is no sign of an upturn this year. During the mid-1980s, demand for chauffeurs outstripped supply and top drivers could command salaries of Pounds 30,000. Since then hundreds of drivers have been made redundant and salaries have fallen by up to 60 per cent. 'Company chairmen say the chauffeur is always the first to go,' said Mrs May Prosser, director of the Beauchamp Bureau. The agency has 200 unemployed chauffeurs on its books, including the late Mr Robert Maxwell's two drivers. It found work for only four chauffeurs last year. Another agency, Hyde Park International, has 575 drivers looking for work and director Ms Jenny Harrison said: 'We're not placing any at all.' Masseys, Britain's oldest domestic staff agency, has told chauffeurs not to register. 'We've got no jobs for them and we haven't seen any increase in demand,' said Mr Richard Hewitt, managing director. The All England Club is offering a brief respite to the downturn by advertising for 216 drivers to ferry players to the Wimbledon tennis championships later this month. More than 1,000 have applied for two-week contracts, including two former drivers from Buckingham Palace. Some ministerial drivers may also be looking for work following the government's decision to explore contracting out of departmental services. The Welsh Office yesterday confirmed it was looking at cost savings on the two chauffeur-driven cars kept in Cardiff. But the Department of the Environment says the 145 drivers employed by Whitehall are unlikely to be privatised. Mr Eric James, a London-based chauffeur, is gloomy about job competition. He has been unemployed since the Gulf war when his Kuwaiti employers decided they could no longer afford a personal driver for their Jaguar XJS, BMW and Mercedes. 'Everyone is cutting back and I don't expect to get any work in the near future,' he said. 'Chauffeurs are being driven off the road.'</p>

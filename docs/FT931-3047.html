			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Red Bood Details): The effects of Budget measures on tax yields THIS section explains how the effects of Budget measures on tax yield are calculated. The general approach: the direct effect of a tax change is the difference between the tax yields obtained by applying the post-Budget tax regime and the pre-Budget tax regime to the levels of income, profit etc expected after the Budget. Since total income and total spending at factor cost are fixed at their post-Budget levels, the estimates of direct effects do not include any effect the tax changes themselves may have on levels of income and spending. Other effects on behaviour are taken into account where they are likely to have a significant effect on the yield. For example, changes to excise duties influence the pattern of consumer spending. The estimates take account of any consequential changes in receipts from related taxes. For example, the estimated yield from increasing the excise duty on tobacco includes the change in the yield of VAT on that duty, but also the change in VAT and other excise duties resulting from the new pattern of spending. The direct effect of some tax changes is affected by the implementation of others. Where this happens, measures are costed in the order in which they appear in the accompanying table. In the first column of the table opposite the pre-Budget regime is simply the regime of allowances, thresholds and rates of duty which applied in 1992-93. The remaining three columns strip out the effects of inflation on the tax system by assuming that allowances, thresholds and rates of duty are increased in line with prices in this and in future Budgets. Measures announced in this Budget are assumed to be indexed in the same way in future Budgets. The move to a November Budget: This year the estimates need to take account of the fact that the normal date of the Budget is being brought forward from March to November. In line with the Chancellor's decisions on indexation provisions and the timing of tax changes, the following assumptions are made in calculating the indexed base: March 1993 Budget: allowances, thresholds and rates of duty raised in line with the increase in the RPI over the year to December 1992 (2.6 per cent); November 1993 Budget: allowances and thresholds raised in April 1994 in line with an assumption for the increase in the RPI over the year to September 1993 (2 per cent). Rates of excise duty rise on Budget day (1 January 1994 for alcohol) in line with the assumed increase in the RPI over nine months to September 1993 (2 per cent). (This assumption for excise duties also applies to the first column of the table.) November 1994 Budget: excise duties rise on Budget day (1 January 1995 for alcohol) and allowances and thresholds in April 1995 in line with the assumed increase in the RPI over 12 months to September 1994 (3 3/4 per cent). November 1995 Budget: rates of excise duty rise on Budget day (1 January 1996 for alcohol) in line with the assumed rise in the RPI in the year to September 1995 (3 1/4 per cent). The RPI assumptions for the November 1993, 1994 and 1995 Budget are stylised figures compatible with the projections of the RPI excluding mortgage interest payments, on the assumption that interest rates remain unchanged at current levels. The following notes refer by number to individual line entries in the main table on the opposite page. Inland Revenue taxes: 1, 3 Under statutory indexation the allowances and limits would have risen by 2.6 per cent. 6 Assumes interest rates are unchanged from current levels. There will also be a reduction in public spending of Pounds 80 million in 1994-95 and Pounds 90 million in 1995-96 on mortgage interest relief for borrowers who are non-taxpayers or liable only at the lower rate of income tax. 9 Assumes average list prices of cars will increase by 3 per cent a year. The new charge would produce the same yield in 1993-94 as the 1993-94 scale charges. 10 Yield under the current system is estimated at about Pounds 5 million a year. Part of the 1994-95 yield is delayed receipt of tax for 1993-94. The 1995-96 yield assumes about 350,000 vans will be taxable in 1995-96. 12 The estimates of revenue effects assume levels of dividends are unaffected, and include the fall in ACT payments by companies, the fall in tax credits paid to non-taxpayers and exempt institutions, the extra income tax payments by higher rate taxpayers and discretionary trusts and the increase in companies' mainstream corporation tax payments. The yield of the changes after 1995-96 is expected to be about Pounds 1 billion per year. 14 The yield represents the estimated direct effect of the measure on the existing level of capital loss buying activity. Without this measure there could be a more significant loss of tax in the future. 18 These proposals will not affect receipts significantly before 1995-96 and are expected to be broadly revenue neutral over a period. 20, 21 The yields represent the estimated direct effect of the measures on the existing level of activity. Without these measures there could be a more significant loss of tax in the future. 23 The figures allow for effects on corporation tax receipts and estimates of the effects of the reform on North Sea activity. 24, 27 Under statutory indexation, the capital gains tax annual exempt amount and the inheritance tax threshold would have risen by 2.6 per cent. Customs and Excise taxes: 35-45 The effect of moving the Budget date from March to late November is to reduce yield from excise duties in 1993-94 by about Pounds 100 million. This is because there is usually a rise in clearances of excise goods before the Budget and a fall afterwards. 1993-94 will include two post-Budget dips, and this will depress receipts over the year as a whole. This is taken into account in the forecast, but not scored as a Budget measure. 39 These figures show the increased yield from road fuel duties which goes beyond what is required to recoup the cost of car tax abolition announced in the Autumn Statement. 46 Duty from the lottery will be broadly offset by reductions in receipts from betting and other taxes on spending. 47 The Finance Bill will include a number of minor measures which individually and collectively have no revenue effect: measures to end the refund of duty on beer returned to bond following the introduction of the new beer end product duty on 1 June 1993; a revised definition of beer; a provision to tax any wine in bottles with mushroom stoppers as sparkling wine irrespective of pressure; reducing the maximum permitted level of fortification of wine from 23 per cent alcohol by volume to 22 per cent. This brings it into line with the maximum level permitted for made wine which was increased from 18.3 per cent to 22 per cent on 1 January 1993; taxing all alcoholic drinks over 22 per cent alcohol by volume at the spirits duty rate; an anti-avoidance measure to ensure that the correct rate of duty is paid on blended drinks; allowing imported spirits denatured to the requirements of other EC member states to benefit from the duty exemption for methylated spirits denatured to UK requirements; to levy hydrocarbon oil duties on volumes calculated at a standard temperature of 15 degrees Celsius rather than the ambient temperature; to extend the existing provisions in EC directives for mutual assistance and mutual recovery of VAT and customs duties to excise duties; existing arrangements for refunding duty on beer exported to the Isle of Man are to be repealed when agreement is reached between the UK and the Isle of Man Government on making beer duty a shared revenue. Vehicle excise duties: 48 Includes changes to motorcycles and other minor rates. Business rates: 50 The cost in 1995-96 is not known since it will depend on the transitional arrangements, if any, introduced following the 1995 revaluation. National insurance contributions: 52 Takes account of the fact that half of Class 4 NIC charges can be offset against self-employment income charged to income tax.

			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Letter: Industry is true worth Sir, I have read with interest your paper's excellent coverage of the recent financial and economic events surround sterling's humiliating exit from the ERM. Initially, most commentators and economists, although fearing the inevitable, were in fact stunned by the act itself. One can even include in that description both the chancellor and the prime minister. However, after the original stunned silence a cacophony of sound has broken out. Everyone has a view, talking heads abound and rolling heads, still yapping, are expected. In the current mayhem I would like to make a point. In essence, the debacle has been caused by the erosion of the manufacturing and commercial base in the UK. Germany and France, countries which have nurtured their industrial companies, have shown us up because currencies represent the true worth of an economy. In a phrase, it is their paper. You can massage the paper by interest rates in the short term, but in the long term it is manufacturing performance that counts. The powers that run Britain must put manufacturing first. It is ironic that high German interest rates, which caused the recent problems were for the very purpose of financing east Germany and putting it to work. Let us try to emulate them.

			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Arts: Rise and Fall of Mahagonny - A production at the Grand Theatre in Geneva THE city of Calvin and the city of Mahagonny: Brecht and Weill would have enjoyed such an attraction of opposites. Whereas, even in Germany Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt Mahagonny had a struggle to be heard during its authors' lifetime, it is now de rigueur in Europe's opera houses. Weill's smoky, sinewy, schmaltzy tunes seem more catchy than ever, especially when delivered with such lustful panache by this up-market Geneva cast. As for Brecht's cheeky moralising about capitalist decadence, nothing could be less dated: the message hangs coldly over our recession-hit bankruptcy courts and red-light districts - 'you make your own bed and lie on it', as Jim Mahoney in Mahagonny is all too fond of repeating before his cruel downfall. But what still is at issue is whether Mahagonny ranks as an opera, as opposed to some sophisticated hybrid of the musical revue. Kurt Josef Schildknecht's production at the Grand Theatre has rekindled all the old doubts. The narrator turned out to be Jeffrey Tate, swivelling round on the conductor's chair, donning a black trilby in the glare of a spotlight and declaiming the continuity lines (superbly) to a taped accompaniment of typewriter clatter. The effect, unfortunately, was to interrupt the dramatic flow of the stage action - set in a vast grey box, with the cast walking on and off in silence like cabaret artists doing their sets. Schildknecht's piecemeal treatment of each scene was no help, with a range of images apparently designed to titillate or shock the audience rather than project a coherent vision of the work. Jenny wore a Madonna-type corset, but left the pouting and gyrating to her companions, who ended up as bunny girls. The men selected their whores by television and queued for condoms with their trousers down. The visual aesthetic (decor by Werner Hutterli, costumes by Renate Schmitzer) was one of cool, arrogant modernity, not unlike what you see today in some German cities. Only when the cast dropped all dramatic pretence and delivered their lines from the footlights, did some form of communication take place. Elsewhere, there were too many barriers between stage and audience - above all, the language barrier (despite French surtitles) and the lack of intimate surroundings. But the music itself has rarely sounded more captivating. Tate was in his element, ever sensitive to balance and dynamics, unfurling the tunes with the artless impulses of a born Weill interpreter, hammering home the doom-laden chords of the final march. The stage was dominated by Marie McLaughlin's Jenny, raunchy, magnetic and full of teasing vocal nuance, a knock-out performance which had the audience in the palm of her hand. Anne Howells' Begbick was a cool trouser-suited businesswoman, sumptuous rather than Brechtian in delivery. Ragnar Ulfung (Fatty) and Harry Peeters (Trinity Moses) were ruthless side-kicks from the criminal profession. Warren Ellsworth's Jim carried an air of gaunt, tragic heroism. Apart from the versatile Miss McLaughlin, who on this evidence deserves a cabaret show of her own, everyone would have benefited from a more conventionally operatic setting.</p>

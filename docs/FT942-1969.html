			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Slovaks forecast growth of 2% The Slovak finance minister, Mr Rudolf Filkus, said yesterday he expected gross domestic product to rise by 2 per cent next year, the first such rise in four years. Mr Filkus said the target was included in the government's draft 1995 budget, due to be approved by the end of July. Slovakia's GDP fell by 4 per cent in 1993 and the National Bank of Slovakia is forecasting zero growth this year. The budget sets targets of 14.2 per cent for unemployment and 13.8 per cent for inflation. The government's GDP target is broadly in line with preliminary forecasts of GDP growth of between 1.5-2 per cent. Mr Juraj Janosik, a national bank economist, said there are signs the Slovak economy is emerging from recession, with the building and chemical industries performing strongly so far this year.</p>

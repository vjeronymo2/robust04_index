The station has bought, but not scheduled for  screening, the documentary, which triggered protests from China  when the BBC showed it last month. Independent documentary  maker Jeremy Bennett said TVB "should have the courage of their  conviction to show the film".    TVB first saw the one-hour documentary at the MIDCOM  television festival in Cannes in October where, according to the  head of sales for the French company Teleimages which  co-produced and sold the documentary, "every station in Hong  Kong wanted to buy the programme". TVB was the highest bidder,  and according to Mr. Bennett, one of the first places in the  world to purchase the programme in November. But TVB now says  it has not decided when, or even if, it will screen the  programme.    The documentary, Mao, The Last Emperor, was bought for the  English-language Pearl channel before the controversy exploded  and the Chinese Government labelled it vicious slander.    Mr. Bennett said he had been told of direct pressure being  placed on Portugal, Britain and Singapore not to show the  programme. While Portugal had ignored warnings that it could  hurt relations between the two countries over Macao and the BBC  screened it on December 20, Singapore withdrew from purchasing  the programme after warnings from China.    "I sincerely hope the TV station in Hong Kong will screen  it.  I don't see why the people of Hong Kong shouldn't see it,  especially as this is such an important topic to them. I'm  surprised they haven't already shown it," Mr. Bennett said.  "Over 20 countries in the world, including all major European  countries, are seeing this film, so why should people in Hong  Kong be deprived of seeing this when it is more important."    TVB spokesman Lily Chan said the station had not ruled out  screening the contentious programme. She said the station had  not talked to any Chinese officials about the documentary and  that it would not expect any interference from China. "We don't  anticipate any pressure because there hasn't been any so far, so  this should not be part of the consideration about when, or if,  to screen it," she said. She said the controversy surrounding  the documentary was not the only criteria when considering its  screening.</p>

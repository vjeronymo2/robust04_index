			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures fell steeply in heavy volume, applying clear downward pressure to the cash market throughout the day, writes Jeffrey Brown. The FT-SE 100 December contract pushed down to 2,955 at one stage but managed to climb back to 2,974 at the official 4:10 close, a decline on the day of 45 points. At this level the premium to the cash market was 17.7 points, with the fair value premium standing at 15 points. December trading volume rose sharply to 16,598 lots, from 10,383 in the previous session. There was genuine selling pressure from the outset but the real downwards drive came once Wall Street had opened at 2:30pm London time. From then on the premium to cash equities narrowed dramatically, squeezing down at times to within two points. Traders said US selling had been substantial. Equally, there was obvious support at 2,955, in spite of the complete absence of institutional business. The tone on Wall Street is providing the main lead at the moment. Turnover in traded options also moved up sharply, rising to 46,199 lots, almost double the previous day's total. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE volume accounted for more than 31,000 contracts. National Westminster was the most actively traded stock option with 1,331 lots dealt.</p>

			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / International Company News: Kaufhof seeks Horten control Kaufhof Holding, the Cologne-based retailer, is seeking to acquire majority control of Horten, the Dusseldorf-based group which is Germany's fourth largest department store chain. According to the Reuter news agency, the Federal Cartel Office in Berlin, Germany's competition authority, has received an application for the move, which will mean further consolidation in the German department store sector. It follows the acquisition of Hertie, the third largest department store chain in Germany, by Karstadt, the biggest, a transaction announced in November last year. This merger gave rise to speculation that Kaufhof would counter the move from its arch rival by increasing its existing 12 per cent stake in Horten. It is thought likely that Kaufhof will at first buy the 26 per cent stake in Horten owned by Westdeutsche Landesbank, the Dusseldorf-based public sector bank, before buying stakes held by other large shareholders. The acquisition will mean further expansion for the Metro Group, the privately-owned Swiss retailing group which controls Kaufhof as well as Asko Deutsche Kaufhaus, another of Germany's largest retailers. Although the move is understandable in the context of the Hertie/Karstadt fusion, it is out of line with Kaufhof's declared strategy of concentrating expansion in the specialty retailing segment of the market. The department store sector has suffered from the decline in German consumer spending as well as a move to the specialty segment.</p>

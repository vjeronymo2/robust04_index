			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by SEL: "Encapsulated Ge-Detector"] </F>   [Text] Aachen/Juelich--An encapsulated Ge-detector has been  developed by the Juelich research center (KFA [Nuclear Research  Facility]) in collaboration with the University of Cologne's  Institute for Nuclear Physics and the Intertechnique company in  Strasbourg. The ultrahigh-vacuumtight, encapsulated germanium  detector was brought to production readiness in the main  Department of Technology within the framework of the Euroball  project. The so-called Euroball is a gamma spectrometer that is  being developed through European cooperation and will be used  for experiments in the field of high-precision gamma  spectroscopy. With it exotic nuclei of borderline stability can  be studied.    In addition to greater reliability, the advantages of the  Ge-detector are protection of the extremely sensitive surface of  the detector as well as ease of operation and  interchangeability. Furthermore, it is possible to join  Ge-detectors together into complex detector arrangements of any  kind whatsoever. These detectors can be regenerated without any  problems when there is radiation damage by heating them up in  standard ovens.    The range of applications of Ge-detectors includes gamma  spectroscopy for the identification of exotic atomic nuclei,  applied research, protection against radiation and of the  environment, and applications in the field of medicine.  Furthermore, the Ge-detectors presented by the KFA nuclear  physics institute in Juelich in the journal "Inside KFA" (No. 3)  can be used in industrial production control and space.    In connection with technology transfer, the Juelich research  center has concluded a licensing agreement for the production of  encapsulated Ge-detectors with Intertechnique. A patent for the  production process has been applied for at the German Patent  Office. This year a total of 16 detectors were produced and  delivered.</p>

			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN RIGHT;  </P> <P> PEOPLE ARE MOVING UP, THE AMERICAN WAY;  </P> <P> NOT JUST THE RICH ARE GETTING RICHER. IN FACT, MOST PEOPLE HAVE BEEN GETTING  RICHER.  </P> <P> Everybody these days is beating up on "the rich." Most of those who do so  carefully define "rich" at a level just above their own. Some of the people I  know who speak bitterly about "the rich" are themselves, compared with most  Americans, up in the stratosphere at $100,000 or more per year. For the public,  "rich" begins at about $50,000 per year -- the top 20%.  </P> <P> Just who are these "rich" Americans? The most striking characteristic of the  top 20% is this: More than any other quintile, it consists almost entirely of  families (90%) and married couples (82%). It has four times more married  couples than the bottom quintile. In fact, each of the four higher quintiles  contains more married couples than the one just below it. Marriage correlates  with income.  </P> <P> Why? Some argue that marriage is good for morale and motivation. It certainly  gives a point to hard work. Without question, the top quintile has far more  workers per household than any other. The Census Bureau reports that a  spectacular 93% of the householders in the top quintile work full time  (considerably more than in lower quintiles) and that 83% of its households have  two to four earners. The average number of full-time workers per family in the  top quintile is seven times larger than in the bottom, and almost 50% larger  than in the other three. These rich may earn a lot, but most also work a lot.  </P> <P> In addition, people in the top quintile have more years of education, buy and  read more books and subscribe to more magazines. Two-thirds of them have had at  least some college, and almost half have had four years or more. You don't have  to be a college graduate to be in the top quintile: 32% completed only high  school or less. But years of education do pay off.  </P> <P> During the Reagan years, of course, it became harder and harder to "make the  cut" into the top 20%, top 5%, top 1%. Not because times were bad, but because  they were so prosperous that the dividing line between brackets kept sweeping  upward, sometimes galloping upward. Between 1980 and 1988, in constant 1988  dollars, the number of households earning $50,000 or more jumped by 6.3  million. The proportion of all households earning above $50,000 increased from  15.8% to 20.8%. In 1980, it took only $29,070 in annual income to make it into  the top 20%, but by 1988 it took $50,593 (in constant 1988 dollars).  </P> <P> A case of the rich getting richer? Not at all. Most people got richer. The  Census Bureau divides all households into nine income brackets. Between 1980  and 1988, significant percentages in every bracket moved up. At the same time,  the proportion of households in the brackets below $50,000 decreased, while the  proportion of those who made more than $50,000 increased. For example, those  earning under $15,000 decreased from 28.8% to 27.3% and those earning from  $15,000 to $49,000 decreased from 55% to 51.9%.  </P> <P> Where did all these folks go? They moved up. The $50,000-$74,999 bracket  increased from 11.3% to 13.4%; the $75,000-$99,999 bracket went from 2.9% to  4.2%, and the topmost bracket (above $100,000) doubled, from 1.6% to 3.2%.  </P> <P> This upward shift in all household income brackets during Ronald Reagan's  presidency accounts for his popularity. Although in constant 1988 dollars only  20% of households had incomes above $29,070 in 1980, by 1988, 38% of all  households earned more than $35,000. This is phenomenal economic progress.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, this epic upward mobility helps to explain why the tax burden also  shifted upward during Reagan's years. Although figures for 1988 are not yet  available, in 1979, the top 10% (in adjusted gross income, more than $32,710 in  constant 1987 dollars) paid 49.5% of all U.S. personal income taxes. But by  1987, those in the top 10% ($54,700 or above) were paying 55.4% of all income  taxes, and the top 1% paid nearly one-fourth.  </P> <P> Left-wing critics sometimes retort: "Of course the rich were paying more taxes  -- they were earning more!" But this retort plays right into the hands of the  supply-siders. Their prediction was: "Greater incentives yield higher  revenues." If you want higher tax revenues from the rich, you should lower tax  rates. And if you want lower revenues, raise rates. It breaks the hearts of the  left but, alas, only as the rich earn do their income taxes pour in.  </P> <P> So let's cut the hypocrisy. Most of those who regularly bash the rich --  including politicians and TV journalists -- are in at least the top 20% (or  much higher) themselves. And if they want to give even more of their money to  the government, they can volunteer. "Put up or shut up" is sound advice they  should heed.  </P></p>

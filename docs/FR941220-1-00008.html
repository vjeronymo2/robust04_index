The CAA advises that probable ingestion of accreted ice, shed from the inner surfaces of the engine air intake ducts, has resulted in engine power rollbacks (loss of engine power) during flight in icing conditions. Five reports have been received: three reports of power rollback on two engines simultaneously, and two reports of power rollback on one engine. Ingestion of accreted ice, if not prevented, could result in multiple engine power rollback during flight in freezing precipitation conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Jetstream has issued Service Bulletin ATP&hyph;30&hyph;39&hyph;30146A (Modification 30146A), dated July 29, 1994, which describes procedures for installing modified de-ice timers for the left and right engines. The modified de-ice timers will provide additional electric power directly to the engine air intake flange heater. This additional electric load requires revision of electric load shedding procedures in the event of electrical system failure. These procedures are included in the Jetstream Aircraft ATP Airplane Flight Manual (AFM), Temporary Revision T/41, Issue 1, dated November 15, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Jetstream has also issued Service Bulletin ATP&hyph;30&hyph;37&hyph;30143A (Modification 30143A), dated August 1, 1994, and Revision 1, dated September 5, 1994, which describe procedures for installation of modified electrical wiring for flexible ducts and lips of the engine air intake. This modification automates turning on the de-ice heaters in the flexible duct of the engine air intake when the lip heat is on. The modification continues to allow pilots to select the de-ice systems of the engine air intake manually, via the ``All On'' switch of the anti-ice system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CAA classified these service bulletins as mandatory, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in the United Kingdom.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Jetstream has also issued Service Bulletin ATP&hyph;30&hyph;30&hyph;35285A, dated July 15,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1994, which describes procedures for installation of a system that automates a 20-second delay between the time that the left engine intake de-ice systems are turned on and the time that the right engine intake de-ice systems are turned on. This modification also reduces pilot workload by automatically turning on the engine de-ice system at an interval 20 seconds apart for the left and right engines when the engine intake de-ice is selected to ``on.'' The automated 20-second time delay ensures that the de-ice system for the left and right engine intakes will be turned on in such a way as to prevent simultaneous rollbacks of the engines in icing conditions. The CAA has not classified this service bulletin as mandatory. However, the FAA has determined that the pilot could easily neglect to heed the necessary 20-second delay if manually turning on the second flexible duct de-ice system; this could cause accumulated ice in the air intake ducts of both engines to dislodge simultaneously and be ingested into the engines, which then could result in rollback of both engines at the same time. In light of this, the FAA considers that the modification described in this service bulletin is necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

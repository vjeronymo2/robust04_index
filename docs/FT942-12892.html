			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Surprise vote clears way for NY exchange merger Members of New York's Commodity Exchange (Comex) and the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex) have approved a historic merger, setting in motion a deal that will create the largest commodity exchange in the world. The affirmative vote, announced on Monday night, surprised even the strongest backers of the merger plan, who engaged in furious last-minute lobbying to win the required two-thirds majority at the Comex. In the end the plan passed by a wide margin of votes at both exchanges. Its strongest supporters are the futures dealing firms who stand to save millions in operating costs when the two markets combine administrative, surveillance, and clearing functions. The merger, scheduled for completion before October, could set the stage for other market combinations in New York. Few in the futures industry believed that members of the Nymex and the Comex would put aside a long history of antagonism and vote to merge, despite the competitive advantages the plan. As the futures business becomes more competitive globally, US exchanges in New York and Chicago have been struggling to cut costs. Neither exchange was forced into the merger - both have seen business rise dramatically in the past year, and membership prices at the Comex have doubled in the past 12 months as interest in gold and silver derivatives has surged. The agreement will result in the Comex, primarily a precious metals futures exchange, being absorbed by the Nymex, the world's largest oil and energy futures market. Comex's 768 members will lose voting rights at the new exchange, but will be paid close to Dollars 70m over a period of five years for the equity in their seats. Nymex will also distribute Dollars 21m to its 816 members as a sort of dividend for approving the merger. Comex members will retain their rights to trade existing products, and gain access to some of Nymex's contracts. Nymex members will gain some Comex trading rights in return. Strategically, the merger will generate immediate competitive benefits. Mr Daniel Rappaport, Nymex chairman, has promised to consider establishing trading in zinc, nickel and aluminium contracts for Comex members, and to improve the spread margins between platinum and gold. Comex products will also be listed on Access, the Nymex after-hours electronic trading system. Additionally, the merger will clear the way for a new futures trading facility in the New York area. The Nymex and Comex share a stuffy and overcrowded trading floor in the World Trade Centre. They had been seeking new sites independently, but will now combine efforts. Mr Rappaport said site selection could be completed in the 30 to 60 days.</p>

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / International Company News: New World lures Tartikoff to top television production post Mr Brandon Tartikoff, who has a reputation as one of the most talented US entertainment industry executives, was named yesterday to the top production post at New World Communications - the media group which shocked the television business last month when its stations switched affiliation to the upstart Fox network owned by Mr Rupert Murdoch. The move is a considerable coup for New World, a media group which forms part of the empire of Mr Ronald Perelman, the New York investor and head of the Revlon cosmetics group. New World owns television stations but is also keen to build up its film production business, called New World Entertainment, which has produced several hit television series. Mr Tartikoff rose to prominence at the NBC television network, where he was chairman of the entertainment group and helped the network to six consecutive seasons as number one in prime time. He left there to head Paramount Pictures, the Hollywood film studio, but resigned abruptly in 1992 to spend more time with his daughter, who had been injured in a car accident. Since April last year he has been president of Moving Target Productions, his independent production company, which is to be acquired by New World. As part of last month's deal, Fox agreed to invest Dollars 500m in New World and work with it to develop syndicated programming, as well as prime time series and movies for Fox. Mr Perelman and Mr Bill Bevins, chief executive of New World, approached Mr Tartikoff about the job after forming their alliance with Fox. Mr Tartikoff said he had been impressed by the vision they shared of the changing television world, their financial resources, and their access to 40 per cent of US homes through the Fox deal.</p>

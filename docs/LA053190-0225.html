			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEIGHBORHOOD PROFILE: MID CITY: FOCUS;  </P> <P> MID CITY: THRIVING AMID CHANGE  </P> <P> Buses run up and down the streets of Santa Ana's Mid City neighborhood with the  frequency of new lovers -- another one will be along any minute. And it's a  good thing, too. The buses give residents mobility and a feeling of  self-sufficiency.  </P> <P> The predominantly Latino section has few of the conveniences associated with  living in the suburbs. There aren't strip shopping centers, banks, dry cleaners  or even gas stations on every block; there are no big chain supermarkets or  major retail stores within easy walking distance. But the neighborhood still  manages to take care of itself.  </P> <P> It is a place where small businesses thrive and Latino store owners and the  community rely on one another. Most of the shop signs are in Spanish, making  those businesses a comfort zone in a neighborhood with a healthy mix of  first-generation American-born Latinos, longtime immigrants and Mexican  nationals.  </P> <P> The Clinica Medica Latina is here, as well as other businesses dealing with  everything from aseguranza (insurance) to immigration. The Top Value Super  Mercado is the all-purpose general store. Signs in the windows announce  "boletos de Lotteria aqui" (lottery tickets here), the availability of giros  (money orders) for 15 cents and that the store accepts estampillas de comida  (food stamps).  </P> <P> Inside, name-brand groceries line the shelves, but the store also makes room  for specialty items and Mexican delicacies. Near the entrance, a woman rolls  fresh hot churros in a sugar-and-cinnamon mixture, while 10 feet away a  matronly woman sells tortillas hechos a manos (handmade tortillas) for $1.35  per dozen.  </P> <P> In the meat case, tripe, catfish, pig feet, tongue and beef lips kiss glass  display windows. And in another section of the mercado, there are  Spanish-language videos for rent, T-shirts for sale at three for $9 and a  variety of other products imported from Mexico.  </P> <P> But Mid City is also a neighborhood in transition. As much as the area takes  care of its own in commerce, in other aspects, things are beginning to change.  </P> <P> "I enjoy Santa Ana; there are a lot of nice people here. It's just been in the  last few months. . . ," lamented Guadalupe Saenz, a ten-year resident of Mid  City who also works as a clerk at the neighborhood's elementary school. "People  used to keep up their yards and lawns -- we didn't have any problems, but now.  . . ," her voice trails off.  </P> <P> But now there are signs of trouble with a capital "T" and that rhymes with "G"  and that stands for graffiti, which is generally followed by the other "G"  word: gangs.  </P> <P> "I don't understand this," Saenz said. "I've met gang members who are really  nice kids. But it's like they have a split personality. At home, they're really  good kids, but outside on the street when they're with their gangs. . . ."  </P> <P> Fortunately, the majority of youths in the neighborhood are not in gangs, but  the small percentage who are cause major headaches for the rest. "Not every kid  you see is in a gang," said Cpl. Rick Reese of the Santa Ana Police  Department's gang detail.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of good kids out there who never receive any credit. Gang  members are in the minority, but they're at the forefront because of all the  violence," he explained. "It's getting out of hand. They may have gotten into  gangs to protect the barrio, but they only end up ruining it. Where there are  no gangs, there are no problems."  </P> <P> As disturbing as the appearance of graffiti is -- along with its implications  -- Mid City has a way to go before it has the gang problems of other  neighborhoods. The fact that it doesn't yet is a tribute to the tenacity and  determination of parents who are working with the area school to give their  children alternatives to the downward, unproductive lifestyle of gangs. A big  part of that success is spelled P-T-A.  </P> <P> The PTA at Martin Elementary School has managed to turn outrage into outreach.  "Our parents are an active part of our school," said Helen M. Matthews, the  school's principal. "We have meetings on the third Wednesday of every month,  and at every meeting we have between 200 and 250 parents. They are always  willing to help."  </P> <P> To help prevent students from becoming targets for drugs and gangs, school  programs such as the city-sponsored, after-school PRIDE (Parks and Recreation  Inspire Dignity and Esteem) Club and the police-sponsored DARE (Drug Abuse  Resistance Education) program are heartily endorsed by parents and heavily  attended by children.  </P> <P> And it doesn't stop there. The parents aren't satisfied with shifting all the  responsibility to the schools. They use tips garnered from PTA meetings on how  to help their children with homework; and when the school needed to stock the  new computer lab, the PTA mobilized, raised $3,000 and supplied the lab with  one-third of the requisite equipment.  </P> <P> The parents get involved in other ways, too. Within the 250-strong PTA is a  small core group of volunteers who regularly help at the school by painting  over graffiti, which appears sporadically, working as teachers' aides in the  classroom and duplicating flyers, bulletins or whatever else the school needs.  </P> <P> The backbone of that core group is Cristina Garcia, president of the School  Site Council. "Mrs. Garcia is one of our main contributors. She is always there  when we need her," Matthews said.  </P> <P> Other supporters include Raquel Martinez, a grandmother who volunteers a lot of  her time at the school; Socorro Gonzales, the PTA president; Maria Pino, a  parent-volunteer who helps with fund-raising activities; and Rosa Perez, who  was praised by President Bush at Santa Ana Stadium in March for her involvement  in fighting gangs and drugs.  </P> <P> As Guadalupe Saenz points out, there are a lot of good people in the  neighborhood. And while some change may be inevitable in Mid City, it will be  tempered by a history of cooperation and fine-tuned by a generation of children  who are growing up experiencing the positive aspects of having a whole  neighborhood watching out for them.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Population  </P> <P> Total: (1989 est.) 4,753  </P> <P> 1980-89 change: +22.1%  </P> <P> Median Age: 25.8  </P> <P> Latino: 77%  </P> <P> White (non-Latino): 17%  </P> <P> Black: 1%  </P> <P> Other: 5%  </P> <P> </P> <P> Income  </P> <P> Per capita: $8,469  </P> <P> Median household: $31,641  </P> <P> Average household: $32,370  </P> <P> Income Distribution:  </P> <P> Less than $25,000: 40%  </P> <P> $25,000-49,999: 45%  </P> <P> $50,000-74,999: 10%  </P> <P> $75,000-$99,999: 3%  </P> <P> $100,000 and more: 2%  </P> <P> By sex and age:  </P> <P> MALES  </P> <P> Median age: 25.2 years  </P> <P> FEMALES  </P> <P> Median age: 26.4 yearsDALLAS M.

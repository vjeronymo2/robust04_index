			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> PUIG'S 'BOUQUET': TRIUMPH OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT  </P> <P> Anne Bancroft is the one with the "nervous disorder," but it's Jane Alexander  who has the case of nerves in Manuel Puig's "Mystery of the Rose Bouquet," in  its American premiere at the Mark Taper Forum.  </P> <P> The two meet in Bancroft's white-on-white suite in a luxurious Agentine  psychiatric hospital. Bancroft is a rich, fractious old lady suffering from a  depression brought on by the death of her favorite grandson in an auto  accident. Alexander is an inexperienced nurse who needs this case, but isn't  sure she's going to be able to handle this patient.  </P> <P> But not so fast. It's also possible that Alexander is a vastly experienced  psychiatric nurse who knows exactly what persona to assume in order to arouse  the curiosity of a stubborn old woman and to get her to start eating.  </P> <P> Interesting premise, no? And it leads to a graceful and life-affirming play. As  he did in "Kiss of the Spider Woman," Puig shuts up two dissimilar people in a  room and, in effect, throws away the key. And again, defying the rule that puts  conflict at the heart of drama, the interest is to see how quickly they arrive  at a relationship, in fact, a friendship.  </P> <P> For the Desmond Morrises of this world, humanity's dominant instinct is a  selfish one: the territorial imperative. In Puig's opinion, what we really want  is somebody to talk to.  </P> <P> And to pretend with. As in "Spider Woman" there's a heavy use of the  subjunctive mood: memories, nightmares, fantasies -- here's where the rose  bouquet comes in -- and daydreams. Some of these may bother the logical viewer.  What is Alexander doing in Bancroft's dream about her dead sister?  </P> <P> A psychological explanation can be devised, but the real reason is theatrical.  This is a two-character play. No intruders wanted. We want to see how well the  players will manage the imaginary roles, as well as the real ones.  </P> <P> Alexander's "real" identity is, of course, one of the play's big questions. Who  is she when she goes off duty? Whom does she go home to? Does she let Bancroft  assist her in her romantic fantasies as a sort of therapy project for the old  lady -- or does she, in fact, need a facilitator for her dreams?  </P> <P> Who is helping whom here? And what's up with Bancroft? By now she realizes that  her nurse isn't all she seems; or rather that she is quite a lot more than she  seems. Why doesn't Bancroft speak up?  </P> <P> Because it would ruin the game. Fantasy and game-playing in "Who's Afraid of  Virginia Woolf?" are seen as neurosis. For Puig, games make the world go 'round  and fantasies are the vehicle of truth. All that counts is that the game be  played with kindness. For all that we don't understand about these two women,  we do understand that they wish each other well.  </P> <P> Actresses Bancroft and Alexander take the Taper stage in just that spirit.  Under Robert Allen Ackerman's direction, they don't play against each other,  but for each other, keeping us within the circle of the play's belief.  </P> <P> Do we believe Bancroft's old lady as much as we do Alexander's nurse? Probably  not. From the very beginning of the play, she's too sharp, too involved with  life, to read as a depressed personality. Her appetite is there, even when she  can't eat a thing.  </P> <P> There's a slight problem too with that Bronx accent, which Bancroft hasn't  taken any trouble to modify. This keeps yanking us back from Argentina, in a  way that Alexander's neutral accent doesn't. The old lady's shrewdness is  wonderfully observed, though. It's a sharp and entertaining performance, with  the detail work still to come.  </P> <P> The nurse's role is one that an actress could play for weeks without  exhausting. Right now, Alexander makes us thoroughly accept the unconfident  nurse that we see, with only the occasional hint -- the efficient way she  manages the blinds, for example -- that we are dealing with a consummate drama  therapist here.  </P> <P> In later performances, perhaps the nurse's "mystery" will be more evident. But  Alexander and director Ackerman seem to feel that the ultimate subtlety is to  play her as simply as possible, and they may be right.  </P> <P> Certainly, we feel the character's goodness. She's like one of those wise  figures in Pirandello who tell us to stop putting names on things -- "truth,"  "untruth" -- and to trust life's healing process. As with "Spider Woman," we  take the point that human instinct is a more reliable guide than words,  especially words at the service of some system. The play is as small and  consoling as a nightlight -- and Arden Fingerhut's lighting is as finespun as  silk.  </P> <P>  Performances Tuesdays-Saturdays at 8 p.m., Sundays at 7:30 p.m., with  Saturday-Sunday matinees at 2:30. Closes Dec. 17. Tickets $22-$28; (213)  410-1062 or (714) 634-1300.  </P> <P> 'MYSTERY OF THE ROSE BOUQUET'  </P> <P> Manuel Puig's play, at the Mark Taper Forum. Directed by Robert Allen Ackerman.

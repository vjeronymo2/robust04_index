			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / International Company News: Berendsen turns in first-half rise to DKr269m SOPHUS Berendsen, majority shareholder in Rentokil, the UK environmental and property services group, reports an increase in first-half net profits to DKr269m (Dollars 39m) from DKr250m a year earlier, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. The results were adversely affected by the strength of the krone. Group sales, of which about 60 per cent are accounted for by Rentokil, advanced 8.5 per cent to DKr4.20bn. Berendsen said that full-year results will be significantly influenced by two important investments earlier this year, Rentokil's acquisition of the Securigard Group and the Berendsen industrial division's acquisition of the UK's Lucas Fluid Power Group.</p>

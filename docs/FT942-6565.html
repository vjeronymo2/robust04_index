			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Doubt cast on efficacy of local pay bargaining Doubt is being cast on the effectiveness of decentralised pay bargaining in holding down pay rises, as an employers' organisation warned the government that workers still expect their pay rises to exceed inflation. Decentralisation of pay decisions in the 1980s helped employers control costs during the recession but may increase the danger of pay inflation as the economy improves, says an article today in the magazine Personnel Management. Mr John Stevens, the Institute of Personnel Management's director of professional policy, and Mr Peter Ingram, a lecturer in economics at Surrey University, say that increasing numbers of employers regard wage costs as a small proportion of their total costs, and as a result there is the chance that all employers will be happy to increase wages by more than the previous average. 'If that happens the average will rise a lot faster than anyone thought.' While they say there are good reasons to suppose that increased competitive pressures on UK companies will keep pay inflation low, they say: 'Decentralisation of pay determination, which has done so much to improve cost control in the downturn could, in the upturn, provide fertile ground for pay escalation.' A second report, based on a survey of 79 employers' associations, suggests that relatively centralised, industry-wide pay bargaining helps to limit pay increases by avoiding 'leap-frogging'. Seventy-four per cent of employer bodies are of this opinion, according to the survey by independent analysts Industrial Relations Services, also published today. In another analysis of recent trends in pay bargaining Mr Robbie Gilbert, director of employment affairs at the Confederation of British Industry, took issue with the claim of some government ministers that the 'inflation-plus' pay mentality was dead. In a speech at Warwick University he said: 'We are not convinced that the RPI-plus mentality has been defeated, though it has undoubtedly been knocked a bit by the decentralisation of pay determination and recession.'

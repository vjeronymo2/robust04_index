			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Slavyanka" program of the Russian Defense </F> Ministry]    [Text] Chuvashiya President Nikolay Fedorov has issued an  edict terminating the duties of the deputies of the soviets of  all levels in the territory of this republic. Their mandates  have now run out. This is connected with the elections to the  new bodies of power. In those places where new bodies of  authority have been only partially elected, consultative  meetings of the new deputies will operate. In other places,  heads of administrations will temporarily carry out the duties  of the new authorities. Run-off elections in Chuvashiya have  been planned for the end of May.</p>

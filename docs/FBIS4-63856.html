			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov by an </F> unidentified correspondent; place and date not given: "Not in  Control of the Situation"]    [Text] [FOCUS] You are calling for stronger links between  the Crimea and Russia. Is that not a provocation vis-a-vis Kiev?    [Meshkov] We are currently witnessing how the Ukrainian  Government is trying to fan the conflict. The present  leadership in Kiev is trying to hold on to power somehow.  However, it lacks social support and is no longer in control of  the situation. That is because its policies have failed in  almost every respect. This particularly applies to the  economy, and the situation is all the worse because a people  that inhabits a state with enormous potential has been condemned  to vegetate in poverty.    [FOCUS] Your movement is accused of Russian nationalism,  separatism, and even political adventurism....    [Meshkov] On the contrary, the aim of our policies is to  protect the Crimea from nationalist excesses.    [FOCUS] But the Crimean Tartars are afraid of your flirting  with Moscow. How do you want to solve the Tartar question?    [Meshkov] Crimean citizens of Tartar nationality were  treated unjustly, and that has to be put right. Unfortunately,  the Crimean Republic is not in a position to bear the financial  cost of a just solution. However, I would like to stress that  the present difficulties do not bear nationalist hallmarks.    [FOCUS] President Kravchuk has not allowed you to change the  security minister and the minister of internal affairs. Your  power has thus been somewhat curtailed.    [Meshkov] That illustrates the kind of conditions we are  working under here. The Crimean security service should work to  protect the Crimean Republic even if it is considered part of  Ukraine. However, I have not even received a fraction of the  information that it sends to Kiev. That is why I had to appoint  a new minister. Kiev's machinations aimed at preventing that  move must be considered very disturbing.    [FOCUS] The defense ministers of Ukraine and Russia do not  want you to take part in negotiations on the Black Sea Fleet.  Did you feel snubbed?    [Meshkov] Even if a president is ignored, the people that  elected him will not allow itself to be ignored.</p>

			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NFL EXHIBITION ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> ANDRE WARE GETS RUDE WELCOME TO PRO FOOTBALL  </P> <P> It was Heisman Trophy winner Andre Ware's professional debut, but Bob Gagliano  stole the spotlight, throwing for two fourth-quarter touchdowns as the Detroit  Lions (4-0) beat the Cincinnati Bengals, 26-24, at Cincinnati.  </P> <P> The Bengals (1-3) led, 24-10, late in the third quarter after Boomer Esiason  threw his second touchdown pass, this set up by Ware's first pro interception.  </P> <P> After Ware -- who signed Monday and made his debut in the second half -- was  ineffective in his two series, completing two of seven for 15 yards, Gagliano  relieved and completed eight of 10 passes for 129 yards to give the Lions their  first unbeaten preseason since 1954.  </P> <P> Gagliano threw a one-yard touchdown pass to Jeff Campbell, a three-yarder to  Willie Green, then hit Campbell with a 26-yarder to set up Wilson Hoyle's  winning 19-yard field goal with 3:39 left.  </P> <P> The Lions opened the game with incumbent starting quarterback Rodney Peete, the  man on the spot with Ware's signing. He had an erratic first half, completing  13 of 24 with one interception and one touchdown.  </P> <P> Seattle 30, San Francisco 10 -- Derrick Fenner ran for two touchdowns and the  Seahawks took advantage of San Francisco turnovers for their fourth consecutive  exhibition victory.  </P> <P> Seattle (4-1) converted a Steve Young interception and a Roger Craig fumble  into Fenner's two touchdowns in the second quarter.  </P> <P> The 49ers (1-3) struggled, playing without quarterback Joe Montana, who sat out  the team's final exhibition game because of a deep bruise on his right forearm,  an injury he suffered in a game against San Diego last Saturday.  </P> <P> Atlanta 45, New England 14 -- At Foxboro, Mass., Chris Miller and Hugh Millen  each passed for two touchdowns, the defense ran back two second-half fumbles  and the Falcons (4-0) completed their first unbeaten exhibition season over New  England (0-4).  </P> <P> Kansas City 27, Green Bay 14 -- Derrick Thomas, Chris Martin and Leonard  Griffin scored second-quarter touchdowns off Anthony Dilweg's turnovers at  Kansas City, as the Chiefs (1-3) beat the Packers (1-3) and their shellshocked  quarterback.  </P> <P> Minnesota 20, Miami 17 -- Wade Wilson threw two early touchdown passes, and the  Vikings (3-1) won at Miami by repeatedly turning back Dolphin scoring threats  in the final preseason game for both teams. Miami finished 1-3.  </P> <P> New Orleans 17, Indianapolis 14 -- At New Orleans, the Saints scored all 17  points off turnovers. Dalton Hilliard and Gill Fennerty both ran for touchdowns  as Indianapolis ended the exhibition season 0-4. The Saints were 4-1.  </P> <P> Denver 25, Phoenix 14 -- Bobby Humphrey ran for two first-quarter touchdowns,  leading the Broncos (3-2) at home in an exhibition finale interrupted for 26  minutes by lightning. Phoenix fininished 0-4.  </P></p>

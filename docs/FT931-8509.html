			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Kingfisher Pounds 560m purchase of Darty boosts shares 30p KINGFISHER, the UK retail group, yesterday agreed its Pounds 560m takeover of Darty, France's biggest electricals retailer, to create one of the largest non-food retailing groups in Europe. The deal was welcomed in the City of London, Kingfisher's shares closing up 30p at 557p. Kingfisher announced it would partly fund the deal with a Pounds 313m, one-for-seven rights issue. 'What Kingfisher has done is to buy a great business, very profitable, very cash generative, with no earnings dilution, which potentially gives it access to new European markets,' said Mr Paul Deacon, retailing analyst at Goldman Sachs. 'It's difficult to fault.' For Kingfisher, which includes the Comet, B&amp;Q, Woolworth and Superdrug chains, the deal is the group's most significant move since its creation in 1982. It also realises its ambition of developing a significant presence in continental Europe. Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy, Kingfisher's chairman, said it would create a business 'with the muscle to compete on a European basis as well as enhancing growth opportunities in our domestic markets'. Mr Philippe Frances, Darty's chairman, said the deal marked the start of a 'strategic European alliance' between the two groups which would enable his company to fulfil its potential. Darty has been a force in French retailing since 1957 when the three Darty brothers, Bernard, Claude and Nathan, opened their first store. It now dominates the white and brown goods sector with 130 stores which command 12 per cent of the French market. The group is still one of France's most profitable retailers but has come under pressure in recent years because of the burden of the FFr4bn (Pounds 502m) net debt left by its 1988 management buy-out from the Darty family and the increasingly competitive state of the French retail sector. Sales slipped from FFr8.75bn to FFr8.56bn in its last financial year to August 31. The deal values Darty at FFr4.45bn. Kingfisher will pay for it with Pounds 207m cash, plus 68m Kingfisher shares, giving Darty shareholders a significant stake of between 10 and 12 per cent in Kingfisher. It will also take on debts of about Pounds 477m. News of the deal was accompanied by a better than expected profits forecast for Kingfisher of Pounds 233m, before exceptional items, for the year to January, up from Pounds 221.8m the year before. The increase reflected strong performances by the Comet and Woolworth chains. However, a write-down of Pounds 26m to cover the cost of Kingfisher's withdrawal from property development will reduce the pre-tax profit after exceptional items to Pounds 210m, from Pounds 227.7m last year.

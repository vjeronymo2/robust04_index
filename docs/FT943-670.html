			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / Lobbyists to publish register of clients Britain's top image-makers yesterday moved to polish their tarnished image by announcing plans to strengthen the regulation of political lobbyists. In a move that follows mounting controversy over the ways some MPs use outside interests to supplement their parliamentary salaries, the public relations industry is to introduce a detailed register of lobbyists and their clients. Practitioners have made repeated calls for parliament to regulate lobbying activities. The industry is following the lead of the Association of Professional Political Consultants. The association recently published its own code of conduct for professional lobbyists. The two organisations behind the latest move - the Public Relations Consultants' Association and the Institute of Public Relations - yesterday portrayed it as an attempt to make more information available about the activities of lobbyists. Both bodies - which represent practitioners and consultancies, some of whom work as lobbyists - have added specific guidelines for political consultants to their general codes of practice. The initiative comes as a powerful House of Commons committee investigates MPs' outside interests after newspaper revelations that two MPs were each ready to put parliamentary questions to ministers in return for a payment of Pounds 1,000. The inquiry is expected to dissuade MPs from supplementing their salaries by being directors or consultants to professional lobbying companies. The political consultants' body already requires members not to 'place themselves in a position of potential conflict of interest'. The new register, which should be operating in eight weeks, will be updated regularly and be available for not more than Pounds 50.</p>

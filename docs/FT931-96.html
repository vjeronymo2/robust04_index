			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / International Company News: Carrefour sale raises FFr1.8bn CARREFOUR, the French hypermarkets group, yesterday raised FFr1.8bn (Dollars 326m) by selling its 28.8 per cent stake in Castorama, one of France's largest do-it-yourself retailers. The placing, which was arranged by Kleinwort Benson Securities in London and Banque Paribas in Paris, involved selling 3.45m shares in Castorama at FFr550 each to institutional investors. Carrefour's shares yesterday fell in Paris by FFr47 to FFr2,686 on the news, while Castorama's shares, which are quoted in Lyon, rose by FFr7 to FFr575. The sale of the Castorama stake is part of Carrefour's new consolidation strategy, which has been pursued since Mr Jacques Fournier took over as chairman last September, following the resignation of Mr Michel Bon, architect of the group's expansion in the 1980s. The proceeds of the Castorama placing will be used to reduce debt. Kleinwort Benson said Carrefour's gearing should fall by 20 percentage points, to between 40 per cent and 50 per cent. Earlier this month, the company announced an 11 per cent rise in net profits to FFr1.33bn for 1992. Castorama, which recently disclosed a 21 per cent rise in net profits to FFr292m on sales of FFr12.2bn for 1992, is controlled by the Dubois family. Its statutes include special provisions to protect it from hostile takeover bids.</p>

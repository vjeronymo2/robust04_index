			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: National lottery It is rather disconcerting to learn how deep the gambling instinct runs among the great and the good of British business. Yesterday, another two FT-SE 100 companies threw their names into the hat to be selected to run the national lottery, bringing the total number of interested consortia to eight. That level of interest alone suggests the bidding for the licence will be fierce and the returns correspondingly meagre. The lottery's high visibility will also ensure operators' profits are sliced to the bone. Nevertheless, even margins of 1 to 2 per cent will appear attractive if the lottery can generate revenues projected at anything between Pounds 2bn and Pounds 6bn. The lottery will undoubtedly take a fair chunk of cash out of the public's pockets. Combined with this April's tax increases, that could lead to some marked shifts in consumer spending patterns. Spending on discretionary items, such as chocolates, newspapers and slot machines may suffer. That helps explain the interest of companies such as Cadbury Schweppes and Rank, which have a clear defensive intent. Those most at threat from the lottery are the pools companies. Littlewoods, which is by far the biggest operator, is determined to fight the lottery tooth and nail. But Ladbroke, which has less muscle, is trying to hedge its bets. Whether the government will accept that Ladbroke can disinterestedly run betting shops, football pools and the lottery simultaneously, however, is a moot point.</p>

			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Defence of Enterprise offer cost Lasmo Pounds 24m Three leading financial institutions received about Pounds 16m in fees to defend the loss-making oil explorer, Lasmo, from a hostile Pounds 1.6bn bid by rival independent Enterprise Oil. Schroders, Goldman Sachs and NatWest Securities were paid about two-thirds of the total Pounds 24m in bid costs, said Mr Joe Darby, chief executive. The rest went in charges such as legal fees. The failed bid has cost shareholders in the two companies almost Pounds 50m. Enterprise disclosed last week that its costs, including an Pounds 18.3m writedown on the value of its 10 per cent stake in Lasmo, would come to Pounds 24m. Lasmo's comments came as it announced first-half net losses of Pounds 22m, against a Pounds 22m profit last time. While the bid costs appeared to push the company into the red, these were more than offset by a Pounds 36m gain on asset disposals. Turnover fell from Pounds 309m to Pounds 306m, partly due to the lower oil price. The results were largely in line with analysts' expectations. Yet the market was impressed with the cost-cutting achieved in the period. Operating costs per barrel fell by 15 per cent to Pounds 3.70. Mr Darby said he expected average costs for the year to fall to between Pounds 3.50 and Pounds 3.55 per barrel. By 1997, unit operating costs would be 25 per cent below 1993 levels. Lasmo now had the financial strength to pursue exploration opportunities and to develop its existing reserves, he said. The company aimed to produce about 210,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day by 1996, against the current 167,000. Gearing fell from 69 per cent to 37 per cent in the first half, largely due to a Pounds 219m rights issue in the spring. Mr Darby estimated that annual spending on exploration would average some Pounds 50m over the next three years. Of the 14 wells drilled in the first half, eight were successful and included two substantial finds in Algeria. Development expenditure was static at about Pounds 117m (Pounds 119m). There was no interim dividend (1.3p). The loss per share was 2.6p (2.8p profit). COMMENT Lasmo yesterday painted a picture of a company which was confident in its strategy and future. The City was inclined to agree. However, even after all the surgery, the company's finding costs will still only be on a par with its rivals. This highlights a fundamental problem for exploration companies, such as Lasmo and Enterprise, which have much higher finding costs than the majors. After losses this year, Lasmo should be just back in profit in 1995, assuming oil prices of Dollars 18. In 1996, a rising production and earnings profile should lead to substantially improved profits. The most tempting aspect for some investors, however, might be the very real prospect of a foreign income dividend this year.</p>

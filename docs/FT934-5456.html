			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Nadir trial judge 'hurt' by probe Mr Justice Tucker, the judge in the case of fugitive tycoon Mr Asil Nadir, yesterday told how he was 'shocked and angry' when he learnt of an investigation into an alleged plot to bribe him. In comments after he had received an apology from the Serious Fraud Office for the offence caused to him last November, when questions were raised as to whether he should remain in charge of the Nadir trial, he said: 'I was very offended and hurt when I heard these allegations made in open court. I have known from the start it was arrant and outrageous nonsense.' The apology came during an application made in court by Mr Andrew Nicol on behalf of The Independent newspaper to lift a reporting ban on court proceedings on November 6 last year, in which details of the allegations and the high-level police inquiry into them first emerged. Mr David Calvert-Smith, representing the SFO, said it now realised the allegations were 'spurious and groundless'. After receiving a report of the police investigation the Crown Prosecution Service said this month that allegations of a Pounds 3.5m bribery attempt had not been sustained. The allegations were said to have been made by a known informant and a female business acquaintance of Mr Nadir who are now believed to be in northern Cyprus. Mr Nadir, who is accused of fraud involving Pounds 30m and was head of Polly Peck, has made his home in northern Cyprus since fleeing Britain. Mr Calvert-Smith told the judge yesterday: 'We apologise deeply for the offence your Lordship felt, but we were attempting to act in the very best interests of the trial.' Mr Justice Tucker agreed to lift the contempt order, saying the only reason he made it in the first place was to try to ensure Mr Nadir would receive a fair trial, not to protect his own position. At the November 6 hearing the judge was told by Mr Robert Owen QC, then prosecuting for the SFO, that there was 'a probability' that officers involved in investigating what he only described as 'matters' would wish to interview him.</p>

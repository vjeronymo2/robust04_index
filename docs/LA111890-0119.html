			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAPERBACKS  </P> <P> LIVING ARCTIC: Hunters of the Canadian North by Hugh Brody (University of  Washington Press: $14.95, illustrated). Brody's thoughtful essays on the  history, culture and languages of the Arctic and sub-Arctic peoples of Canada  contrast the let's-rub-noses stereotypes with the true nature of these caring,  anti-authoritarian cultures.  </P> <P> The respectful relationship that the Inuit maintained with their seemingly  hostile environment ensured the survival of the people and the animals that  supplied their food. (Recent studies have shown that their exclusive diet of  meat and fat supplied all the nutrients necessary for human health: Diabetes  and other metabolic diseases were unknown among the Inuit until "Southerners"  introduced them to flour, sugar and alcohol.) The concluding discussion of  politics documents the growing movement among the Native Peoples to preserve  their traditional values, despite the increasing commercial exploitation of the  Arctic and its mineral resources.

			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Rolls-Royce set to secure Saudia order Rolls-Royce could win a significant piece of the Dollars 6.2bn (Pounds 4.1bn) fleet renewal and expansion programme by Saudia, the Saudi Arabian national carrier, by supplying it with engines for its US-built Boeing widebody airliners. If confirmed, the engine order would represent a consolation prize for Europe, which in February was dealt a heavy blow by the Saudi government when it opted for Boeing and McDonnell Douglas aircraft to modernise Saudia's fleet. The European Airbus consortium had hoped to win a large slice of the Saudia order but in what was seen as a highly political decision after an unprecedented degree of US government export promotion, the Saudi government said it intended to buy only US-built airliners. Saudia has been holding complex talks with the two US aircraft manufacturers during the past six weeks to select the number and types of airliners for its fleet modernisation programme. The airline is now drawing up a report to be submitted to its government recommending the purchase of a total of 61 airliners, including Boeing 737 twin engine narrowbody aircraft, Boeing 747 four engine and 777 twin engine widebody airliners and McDonnell Douglas MD11 three engine widebody aircraft, according to the Saudi al-Hayat newspaper. The Saudi government is expected to take a final decision on the huge order this summer. The US Export-Import Bank has already said it would guarantee Dollars 6.2bn financing for the deal. Quoting informed sources, the newspaper said Saudia had also recommended the selection of engines to power its new aircraft. It said General Electric of the US was expected to take 46 per cent of the engine package, with Pratt &amp; Whitney of the US taking 26 per cent and Rolls-Royce of the UK taking 28 per cent. Since the UK group does not build engines for the Boeing 737 or the MD11, its potential order would involve supplying powerplants for the Boeing 747 and 777 widebody airliners. Rolls-Royce yesterday declined to comment on the newspaper report. Although the deal would represent an important breakthrough for Rolls-Royce and its new Trent 800 large engine designed for the new Boeing 777, it risks sparking some resentment in European aerospace industry circles. French aerospace officials have often criticised in private what they regard is the UK government's ambivalent stance in promoting European commercial aerospace exports. They suggest the UK has tended to favour Rolls-Royce, whose engines at present equip more Boeing than Airbus aircraft, rather than Airbus in which British Aerospace has a 20 per cent stake. This reflects the relatively higher UK value of a Boeing aircraft equiped by Rolls-Royce engines compared with an Airbus aircraft equipped with a US power plant. Engines account for about 20-25 per cent of the value of an airliner but they also produce considerable additional long term revenues from sales of spare parts, aerospace analysts note. However, the UK value of an Airbus aircraft with Rolls-Royce engines such as the A330, the new twin engine Airbus widebody offered but not selected by Saudia, rises to around 50 per cent.</p>

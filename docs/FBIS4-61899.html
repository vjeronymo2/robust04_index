			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, May 10, BNS -- The parliament faction of  the senior political party in the Estonian governing coalition,  the Pro Patria, issued a protest against Monday's [9 May]  lighting of a memorial fire at the feet of a statue of Russian  soldiers killed in World War II.    The temporary re-lighting of the fire in the memorial at  Tonismagi, Tallinn, was authorized by Tallinn City authorities.    The Pro Patria faction in its statement today reminds that  the victory of the Soviet Union over Nazi Germany in World War  II meant for Estonia just replacement of one occupation with  another.    "Also at the meeting at Tonismagi yesterday calls directed  against the Estonian statehood were voiced and the symbols of a  country that occupied us -- of the Soviet Union -- used," the  Pro Patria says.    Quoting the fact that the Tallinn council and City  Government  are headed by opposition Coalition Party leaders Tiit Vahi and  Jaak Tamm, the statement also points out that at a time when the  Coalition party-led municipal administration gave a green light  to the anti-Estonian rally, also attacks by the opposition  against the Estonian Government delegation for talks with Russia  have escalated.    "The Estonian delegation has remained true to Estonia's  interests in everything and everywhere. At the same time we are  concerned about the using of the Russian card as a tool to  achieve domestic political aims by some political forces. We  cannot go to concessions over issues vital to the Estonian state  and people," the statement reads.    The permission issued by the municipal administration to  Russian organizations to re-light the eternal fire was also  protested by another ruling coalition member -- the National  Independence Party.    "Lighting of the eternal fire was a moral support to the  occupation forces still in Estonia," the party's Tallinn branch  said in a statement.    The protests came after Russian organizations had held a  ceremony at the Tonismagi memorial before noon on Monday to mark  the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II.    Wreaths were laid at the monument Monday by representatives  of the Tallinn veterans league, the Russian Assembly, Russian  deputies in the City Council, and the Russian Embassy in Tallinn.    The ceremony was followed by an Orthodox Holy Liturgy in the  Alexander Nevsky Cathedral at nearby Toompea.</p>

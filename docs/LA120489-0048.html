			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEMBLOR ENCORE;  </P> <P> CHRONICLER OF 1906 S.F. QUAKE TURNS ATTENTION TO '89 DISASTER WITHOUT MISSING A  BEAT  </P> <P> As this city's official archivist, Gladys Hansen feels right at home in a musty  room on the third floor of the Main Library. It is here where she has spent  more than two decades of her working life on the study of a few moments in  time: the 1906 earthquake and fire that devastated San Francisco.  </P> <P> Her findings appear in the book "Denial of Disaster," which arrives in  bookstores Thursday. The book contains about 300 never-before-seen historical  photos and hundreds of stories left by survivors documenting the true extent of  that earthquake.  </P> <P> But her work does not end there. Now, as a result of the 7.1-magnitude temblor  that struck Northern California on Oct. 17, the 64-year old researcher has  begun to gather the material for a possible sequel. Only this time, she's using  firsthand accounts.  </P> <P> "After the quake, I realized this would be a great opportunity to gather  materials from people to write their own story while it's still fresh in their  memory, not 50 years later," she said.  </P> <P> On Oct. 17, She was engaged in her usual routine of meticulously researching  books and records -- her full-time job with the city -- when "the building  started making this awful sound, like rocks grinding," she said. "Then I looked  up among the bookshelves and noticed this rising cloud of dust. I knew  immediately what was going on."  </P> <P> Two days after the jolt, Hansen and her staff of five assistants passed out  flyers on the streets to citizens, asking them to record their personal stories  and to mail them to the library. The main library building in Civic Center was  closed to the public after the quake but remains open to Hansen and the rest of  the staff.  </P> <P> So far, Hansen's group has solicited earthquake stories from nearly 400 men and  women, and just as many from children from Bay Area schools, who sent in  letters, poems, photographs and drawings.  </P> <P> "I've been really taken aback on how well-written and exciting these stories  are," Hansen said. "We've been overwhelmed by the public's reception to share  their stories."  </P> <P> The letters, particularly from children in kindergarten through high school,  keep pouring in.  </P> <P> Among them is 6-year-old Albert Hinkle's recollections. He was staying at the  Noriega Children's Center in the city's Sunset District when the quake hit. "I  was under the table," he wrote. "I didn't panic. The closet was moving. And  blocks fell down. The lights went off. The clock was dead."  </P> <P> One file contains crayon drawings by students at Grattan Elementary School. One  of the pictures, titled "Electricity goes out" by first-grader Andy Nguyen,  portrays two characters holding candles. First-grader Christopher Alberto drew  "The phones are dead," a page marked by crisscrossing black lines.  </P> <P> "The kids really have an imagination," said Frank Quinn, Hansen's 74-year-old  research assistant and a retired registrar of voters. "Their accounts are so  vivid and innocent. We're really smitten by these because the children are the  future generation."  </P> <P> The hundreds of letters are neatly filed alphabetically by the writer's last  name in cardboard boxes and each file is labeled. The labels range from  "Candlestick Park -- World Series" to "Paraplegic's account of earthquake day."  The storytellers represent an assortment of ages, professions, backgrounds and  locations.  </P> <P> "You had two waves going on during the earthquake," Hansen said. "One was the  wave of tourists fleeing the city, and the other were Bay Area residents either  on out-of-town business trips or on vacation elsewhere, who came back to the  city just as fast as the tourists left it.  </P> <P> "We're trying to reach people who were among the tourists who fled as soon as  possible after the quake hit. Obviously, their reaction to the quake is totally  different from native San Franciscans." Hansen has already heard from some  visitors.  </P> <P> Loretta Anderson of Minneapolis was attending a business convention with her  husband at the downtown Hilton on Oct. 17 when the building rocked back and  forth. She wrote, "I'll take good old Minnesota blizzards and yes, tornadoes,  anytime. At least you have a warning. No one can predict an earthquake."  </P> <P> Steve Cotton and his wife, Carol, cut a vacation in London short after they  were telephoned at 6 a.m. (London time) on Wednesday, Oct. 18, by a friend who  told them that "there's been a terrible earthquake, the Bay Bridge collapsed  and the Marina's on fire." The Cottons left London on Sunday morning and headed  home.  </P> <P> "The first surprise was the eeriness of the city," Steve Cotton wrote of their  arrival back. "Our cab was the only car on the road."  </P> <P> For Koula Meletis of San Francisco, returning home from her job in the downtown  financial district required hiking because public transportation had stopped  running. She walked exactly 7.1 miles to get home, she noted, which is the same  number as the magnitude of the quake.  </P> <P> "It looked like a war zone the whole way home," Meletis wrote. "There was  debris and broken glass everywhere. I walked through the darkness and relied on  the headlights of cars to guide me home. Not bad for a 58-year-old woman."  </P> <P> In 1965, Hansen established the San Francisco Earthquake Research Project as a  private, volunteer effort to piece together the full story of the 1906  earthquake. Among the volunteers was her son, Richard, a search-and-rescue  instructor and photographer.  </P> <P> "Denial of Disaster" is the result of 24 years of work by Hansen. It was  scheduled to have rolled off the publisher's presses on Oct. 19. The press run  was delayed for days by Cameron Publishing of San Francisco to allow time to  insert one page devoted to the 1989 earthquake.  </P> <P> The book has since raised controversy with its claims that the 1906 earthquake  deaths were purposely minimized by city officials who wanted the world to know  that the quake was not so bad, that the resulting fires caused most of the  havoc. Businesses similarly downplayed earthquake devastation and blamed their  losses on fires so they could collect on their fire insurance, Hansen's book  contends. The book also says that photographs of the destruction were  retouched.  </P> <P> "There's no way this one could be denied," Hansen said of the impact of the  recent quake. "It's all right here," she said in an interview, holding up her  files. "Hopefully, this last one gave us the opportunity to see what went wrong  and allowed us the chance to rehearse our response to the next great  earthquake."  </P> <P> Comparing the letters she has received, Hansen said people's mood changed as  time went by.  </P> <P> "In the beginning, we received letters from folks who said, 'That's it, I'm  leaving,' " Hansen said. "But now, no one is saying that. More and more say  this is where their heart is and they're staying."  </P> <P> Hansen said it is too soon to tell if the materials she is gathering will lead  to another book. Her priority is to keep collecting resources and eventually  she wants to preserve the letters on microfiche. She looks forward to next  month when the archive room and the rest of the library is scheduled to reopen  to the public.  </P> <P> "People will always want to know what happened," she said. "They want details.  The stories they've recorded here are what make the event human for future  generations."  </P> <P> Junior high school student Eugenia Crowley put her thoughts down in a poem she  submitted for her creative writing class, then mailed to Hansen:  </P> <P>  "Children will listen when the old folks say,  </P> <P>  'I was there when it happened, I remember it well.  </P> <P>  When the earth shook on that fateful day  </P> <P>  And the bridge was damaged that spans the Bay."'  </P> <P>  This will help, says Gladys Hansen, to keep the record straight.  </P></p>

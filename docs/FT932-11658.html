			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Markets: The cash that has nowhere better to go - Wall Street ONCE AGAIN, the US stock markets are being propped up by huge inflows of investors' cash. Figures released by the Investment Company Institute this week showed that mutual fund sales reached a record Dollars 11.3bn in March, and the early indications are that April could come close to matching that figure. The first quarter sales total of Dollars 60.1bn exceeded the old record by almost a third. The vast flows of money into stock funds, and eventually into stocks, are helping to mask signs of weakness in some key equity market fundamentals. Stocks remain expensive by historical standards, economic growth is slackening, domestic interest rates have probably bottomed, and corporate profitability, while it has improved in recent quarters, remains a hostage to economic conditions - which means earnings could suffer if the recovery slows down further. Yet the fact that investors are hurrying to put their money into stock funds is not necessarily a vote of confidence in equities. First, an increasing amount of the new money is going into foreign stock funds as more investors turn away from unexciting domestic markets and look for better returns overseas. The weak dollar has only encouraged this greater interest in foreign securities. Second, March and April have been strong months for stock fund sales partly because many investors rushed to put funds into their individual retirement accounts (IRAs) before the April 15 tax-filing deadline. President Clinton's first budget includes considerable tax increases and individual investors, many of whom fall in the range of income-earners facing higher government levies, were eager to make tax-deductable contributions to their IRAs before the tax year ended. Third, money has been flowing into mutual funds in record amounts, but fund managers have not necessarily been putting all of it into stocks. Since January, stock fund managers have been building up their cash holdings. At the start of the year 8.9 per cent of fund assets were held in the form of cash. By the end of March that figure had risen to 9.9 per cent, or Dollars 52.2bn. While there is little doubt that some of that money will eventually find its way into the markets, the recent rise in cash holdings reflects a wariness among fund managers about the outlook for shares. Moreover, this fondness for cash is remarkable given the miserable returns available on cash investments. Investors are considered lucky if they can get much more than 3 per cent on short-term assets like money-market funds and Treasury bills. After inflation, they struggle to break even. Yet fund managers are not alone in believing it prudent to hold more cash. A recent survey by The Wall Street Journal found that the average cash level recommended by strategists at a dozen big brokerage houses is now 14.25 per cent of assets - the highest level seen in three years. At Dean Witter, for example, chief investment strategist William Dodge has kept his asset allocation at 60 per cent equities, 25 per cent bonds and 15 per cent cash. In normal times, Dean Witter would have only 5 per cent of assets in cash. What this all means for the markets is that stocks are being supported as much by the realisation that equities are the only game in town as they are by any deep-rooted confidence in the outlook for share prices. (It is true that bonds had a superb first quarter, but the Treasury market rally looks as if it has peaked.) If inflation, and interest rates, pick up sharply over the summer, the flow of investors' funds could be quickly diverted away from stocks. We have had a little taste of that already, in the form of the recent rebound in gold prices, which have benefited from a sudden revival of interest in gold as an alternative investment to bonds and stocks. This week's first quarter gross domestic product report did not help the stock markets' cause. While investors had been bracing themselves for economic growth to show a decline from the unsustainably high 4.7 per cent rate achieved in the last quarter of 1992, the news that GDP rose by 1.8 per cent in the first three months of this year still came as an unpleasant surprise. Some analysts tried to pin the disappointing growth on the severe winter weather during the three months, but that did not wash. The most worrying aspect of the data was that without a big jump in inventories, the economy would actually have gone into reverse in the quarter. Monday    3398.37 - 15.40 Tuesday   3415.93 + 17.56 Wednesday 3413.50 -  2.43 Thursday  3425.12 + 11.62 Friday    3427.55 +  2.43</p>

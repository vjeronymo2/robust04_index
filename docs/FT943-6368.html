			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Hume looks beyond IRA ceasefire Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour Party, yesterday called for talks with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, to start as soon as possible after a genuine end to IRA violence. As speculation continued to mount that the IRA might be about to call a general ceasefire, the air of optimism was reinforced by Cardinal Cahal Daly, leader of the Irish Catholic church, who said Northern Ireland could be on the brink of the best opportunity for peace in 25 years. But the mood was dampened by unionist leaders who voiced fears that Britain might be preparing to make concessions in return for a ceasefire. Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader, is likely to raise such concerns with Mr John Major at a meeting expected to be held in a few days. Downing Street said last night, however, that there was no guarantee this meeting would take place this week. Mr Kevin McNamara, shadow Ulster secretary, yesterday warned unionists against trying to block political progress, saying that they should be reassured by guarantees in the Downing Street declaration that there would be no reunification without the consent of the majority in Ulster. Mr Hume, said from his holiday home in Donegal a day after issuing a joint statement with Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president: 'If violence has genuinely stopped, the next step has to be dialogue and I would like to see that begin as soon as possible.' He also responded to scathing unionist criticism of his weekend statement with Mr Adams. He said: 'They don't seem to be listening to what I am saying. We have said that a new agreement is only viable if it enjoys the allegiance of the different traditions on this island. Agreement cannot be achieved without the unionists . . . my objective from day one has been to achieve a total cessation of violence followed by dialogue.' Earlier Mr Molyneaux had accused Mr Hume of 'selling his soul to the devil and joining in a sordid attempt to blackmail the British, American and Irish governments into giving the Armalite supremacy over the ballot box'. The British and Irish governments have repeatedly stressed that a total cessation of violence would be required before Sinn Fein could be admitted to the all-party talks process. The Irish government has offered early participation to Sinn Fein in a 'Forum of Peace and Reconciliation', while the British government has said that a three-month 'quarantine' period would be required before it would enter into negotiations with Sinn Fein. London has refused to make clear whether secret contacts with republican leaders have been resumed, however - although it has pledged that any secret communications would be consistent with publicly stated policies. Mr Hume and Mr Adams said in their joint statement that they believed the 'essential ingredients' of a peaceful approach to a political settlement 'may now be available'. But they said a 'heavy onus' lay on the British government to respond positively. This was echoed by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, who said the British government had a 'heavy responsibility' to bring about a settlement which included 'an all-round demilitarisation of the situation and the full participation of all parties, on equal terms, in talks leading to a comprehensive political settlement'. Cardinal Daly said it had long been the goal of many to take the gun out of Irish politics. 'The attainment of that goal may now be very near.'</p>

He promised that efforts would continue to obtain  the closure of these two centers. Bara said that the  implementation of the anti-terrorism law had led to abuse in  some cases, especially with regard to the way in which searches  were conducted and the failure of the authorities to respect the  duration of preventive detention, which does not exceed 12 days  according to the anti-terrorism law.    The chairman of the National Human Rights Monitoring Group  did not conceal the fact that there were abuses and a number of  suspicious deaths. According to him, the monitoring group had  asked for judicial inquiries to be opened in this regard.    On the question of torture, which the monitoring group  condemns, Bara stressed that no incriminating complaints had  been made to the judicial authorities, which would have made it  possible to open a judicial inquiry against those accused of  practicing torture. He said that the only thing in this respect  was that about 12 complaints of ill treatment had been recorded.  Judicial inquiries had been opened on these issues and those  against whom the accusations had been proven had been punished.    Bara said that the detainees he had mentioned were those  remaining from an original total of 9,000 detainees who had been  sent to seven different security centers last March.</p>

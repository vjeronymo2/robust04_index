			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Olav Trygge Storvik: "Defense Cuts May Lead to </F> New Base Policy"]    [Text] Norwegian base policies and other self-imposed  restrictions will have to be reevaluated.    This is the opinion of Hans J. Rosjorde (Progress Party),  chairman of the Storting Defense Committee. He is strongly  supported by Ingvald Godal and Are Naess, the defense policy  spokesmen for the Conservative Party and the Christian People's  Party, respectively.    "We are reaching a point where we have to be willing to  reevaluate our whole defense strategy. At such a time it will  also be necessary to reevaluate both the base policy and the  self-imposed restrictions," Rosjorde said.    A considerable gap between defense appropriations and the  recommendations of the Defense Committee is making a  reevaluation necessary, according to Rosjorde. The shortage in  appropriations has made it even less likely that the goals of  the Defense Committee can be realized. As a result the Armed  Forces' combat structure must be reexamined.  <H5>  2 Billion Short </H5>   According to the government, the gap is a good 1 billion  kroner, but Conservative Ingvald Godal thinks it is more than 2  billion. The difference is explainable in terms of which year  is taken as the base for the calculation, and in terms of  whether it is the government's proposed or passed budget that is  considered.    "We cannot continue this way. If the appropriations are not  increased, we will have to reevaluate our whole defense  strategy," Rosjorde said. He pointed out that the missing  appropriations are making it very difficult for the Defense  Forces to maintain a defense against invasion in North Norway.  "If, for instance, the Army is not able to maintain division  structure in the north, there will be doubts in the future as to  the professional qualifications of Norwegian officers to lead  large Army units," Rosjorde said.    Until now Norway has required that all allied reinforcement  forces be put under Norwegian command while in Norway, but it is  not certain that the requirement can be maintained in the  future. Rosjorde thinks that allies who send reinforcements to  Norway will not be willing to put their troops under Norwegian  command because of the Norwegians' lack of professional  competence.    "If we do not want to make the appropriations needed to  maintain the kind of defense that the Defense Committee decided  on, we will have to take the consequences and assess all the  restrictions we have imposed upon ourselves in our security  policy. This will apply both to bases for foreign troops in  peacetime as well as restrictions on exercises and the  curtailment of flights east of a certain longitude," Rosjorde  said. The only thing he would exclude from such a reevaluation  is the ban on deployment of nuclear weapons in Norway.  <H5>  Next Budget Decisive </H5>   "I have been thinking the same as Rosjorde," Are Naess  (Christian People's Party) said. He does not want to take  responsibility for whatever political signals there are in  Rosjorde's statements, but agrees on what the consequences would  be if the defense budgets are not made to meet the stated goals.  "The next budget will be decisive," Naess said. "If they  continue the trend of accumulated deficits they will either have  to demonstrate a rationalization effect that has not been  demonstrated earlier, or else we will have to look at out entire  defense concept."    Ingvald Godal (Conservative) said that the Conservative  Party  will have a major defense policy conference in early April to  discuss all aspects of the problems related to the shrinking  defense budgets. "I think it likely that the opinions expressed  by Rosjorde will be echoed. The Conservative Party wants to  carry out the Defense Committee's recommendation. We take a  serious view of the situation we now find ourselves in because  of the Defense Forces not being in step with the world we live  in," Godal said.</p>

			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANTS RAISE $11,435 DONATION FOR RED CROSS  </P> <P> Orange County restaurants donated $11,435 to the Red Cross Disaster Fund this  week, responding to restaurateur Rex Chandler's challenge to donate 10% of  their take from Saturday's receipts.  </P> <P> Chandler, owner of Rex Restaurant in Newport Beach and the Newport Oyster Bar  &amp; Grill, also is a board member of the county's American Red Cross chapter.  Last week he asked fellow restaurateurs to designate Saturday as "Nov. 4 for  the Red Cross."  </P> <P> In addition to Chandler's own restaurants, those participating included the  Bouzy Rouge Cafe, the Cannery, Marrakesh, Malarkey's Irish Pub and Cano's, all  in Newport Beach.  </P> <P> Others were Ruby's Diners in Fullerton, Balboa, Costa Mesa, Mission Viejo and  Seal Beach; Back Bay Rowing &amp; Running Club, Costa Mesa; Bangkok 4, Costa  Mesa; Studio Cafe, Corona del Mar, and Salud! in Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> Chandler said there has been "a tremendous outpouring of concern" from Orange  County for victims of the Oct. 17 Bay Area earthquake. He said 200 people from  Orange County have worked for the Red Cross in the Bay Area.  </P> <P> In addition, Bill Medley's Oct. 29 earthquake relief benefit show at the  Righteous Brothers' Hop in Fountain Valley raised about $5,500, according to  Cherlynn Hurdle, office manager at the Hop. The money, earmarked for San  Francisco disaster aid, was donated through the Orange County chapter of the  American Red Cross. Medley's show featured a guest appearance by Jennifer  Warnes for "(I've Had) The Time of My Life," the duo's hit theme from "Dirty  Dancing."  </P></p>

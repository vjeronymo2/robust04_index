			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Bank strike planned in Italy Banking activity throughout Italy is expected to be paralysed by a day-long strike today of 330,000 employees protesting at the failure to renew a wage and work conditions contract that expired in December 1992. Several other groups of workers are also in the process of renewing their contracts after suffering effective loss of earnings over the past two years of recession. Yesterday 140,000 workers employed in local transport staged a 24-hour stoppage over the failure to renew a contract that lapsed at the end of 1991. In both instances the strikes are centred less on wage increases and more on improving conditions of employment and ensuring new investments. The bank employees are resisting employers' demands for more flexible working hours and a shake-up in promotion procedures, which employers have linked to higher pay.</p>

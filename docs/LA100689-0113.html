			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: ROBINSON, JOHNSON WILL MANAGE IN 1990  </P> <P> Manager Frank Robinson of the Baltimore Orioles said he will return to the  team, as expected, but in something of a surprise, Dave Johnson kept his job,  after all, when the New York Mets announced that he will be back for a seventh  season as manager.  </P> <P> Johnson, 46, signed a three-year contract after last season. He has led the  Mets to two division titles and four second-place finishes in six years, with a  575-395 record.  </P> <P> Robinson, 54, a candidate for American League manager of the year, has a  three-year contract that renews itself after every season and guarantees him a  position in the Orioles' front office when he is through managing.  </P> <P> Robinson led the Orioles to an 87-75 season one year after the team finished  54-107.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LOYAL IOWANS REUNITE AS BOONE COMPANIONS  </P> <P> One man remembered taking baths in a big metal tub. Another man had skinned a  skunk on his way to school and was sent home because he smelled so bad. A third  stole watermelons for fun.  </P> <P> These folks -- and about 150 other men and women -- gathered at Knott's Berry  Farm on Saturday to remember the good times they had in the small Midwestern  town of Boone, Iowa. They're part of a society formed in memory of the town,  which boasts ownership of what they describe as the last steam engine train.  </P> <P> Boone is a town of 12,000 people, a few miles east of the Des Moines River.  Named after the youngest son of frontiersman Daniel Boone, the town began in  the 1860s as a major train depot and a mecca for corn and soybean farming.  </P> <P> The folks gathered together Saturday love the little town. In fact, the annual  meetings have become so popular that "Booneites" flock from all over the  country to attend. This year, one woman traveled from Maine just for the  meeting.  </P> <P> "It's crazy that this many people get together," said Jackie Bennett, who  married an expatriate Boone resident. "I can't think of a town smaller than  Boone."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Jackie Bennett joined in with gusto as her husband, DuWayne, and  other Booneites ate chicken and mashed potatoes at the Chicken Dinner  Restaurant. As part of the ceremonies, they also sang the "Iowa Song,"  demonstrating how natives talk: "We're from I-oh-way!"  </P> <P> It's believed that the Boone, Iowa, Society of Southern California started with  a handful of families who, beset by unemployment, moved to California and kept  in touch with one another through yearly get-togethers, said society president  Arney Tuttle.  </P> <P> The tradition grew, evolving into the 76th annual event Saturday.  </P> <P> "It's just a small town with friendly people," DuWayne Bennett explained.  </P> <P> Back when he grew up, playing hooky and sneaking off to the swimming hole or  going fishing were leisure activities. For work, he detasseled corn and weeded  bean fields.  </P> <P> "We used to steal watermelon. That was entertainment back then," he joked.  "There was never much to do in Boone."  </P> <P> At age 17, he enlisted in the military and eventually moved to Southern  California.  </P> <P> A large part of the exodus landed in Southern California -- so many, in fact,  that Bill Dickson, 74, at first believed Long Beach was actually called Little  Iowa when he moved there during the Depression.  </P> <P> Dickson attended the luncheon to see lifelong friends.  </P> <P> So did Ruth Wooten Hawes. The 73-year-old woman came all the way from Maine to  see her long-lost friend from school, Louise Dorrance Sallows, also 73.  </P> <P> "We lost track of one another and haven't seen each other for 57 years. We were  best friends all through school," Wooten said. "Louise translated Latin for me.  I wasn't smart like she was."  </P> <P> "You did other things," Louise Dorrance giggled.  </P></p>

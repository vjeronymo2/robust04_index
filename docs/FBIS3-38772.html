			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Russia and France have decided to step up defense  cooperation by extending it, for the first time ever, to  industrial arms production, according to the terms of two  accords signed by the Russian and French Defense Ministers Pavel  Grachev and Francois Leotard in Moscow on Friday [4 February].  The two countries concluded a specific industrial cooperation  accord, the first ever of this type signed by Russia and a  western European country. Two cooperative projects out of a  total of 20 projects under consideration are already the subject  of close negotiations. The first project involves the  modernization (radar, avionics, engine) of old-generation MiG  fighters which are not considered competitors of French aircraft  intended for exportation. The project will be conducted by  SAGEM [Company for General Electricity and Mechanics  Applications] and Dassault Electronique and will focus on MiG  21, 23, and 27 aircraft.    The second project involves the construction of a future  training aircraft for the Russians, who are currently using  Czech aircraft for this purpose. The future aircraft will be  named MiG AT (Advanced Trainer). Its frame will be built by the  Russian Mikoyan [name as published] company, while the version  destined for the Russian Air Force will be equipped with a  Larzac engine manufactured by SNECMA [National Company for  Aircraft Engine Studies and Construction] which is currently  used on the French Alphajet. In addition, the export version of  the training aircraft -- which is expected to open new markets  for French companies -- will be equipped with an avionics  system made by Sextant Avionique.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A Yemeni delegation, led by Salim Salih Muhammad,  assistant secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP],  arrived in Damascus today. The delegation was received at  Damascus International Airport by Rashid Akhtarini, deputy prime  minister for services affairs.    In a statement to a SANA correspondent, Salim Salih Muhammad  said: Our mission is to brief our brothers in sisterly Syria on  the latest developments in Yemen, particularly the fierce  fighting between the northern and southern parties. We would  like to acquaint President Hafiz al-Asad with what is really  taking place, particularly the need for abiding by cease-fire,  stopping the bloodshed, and implementing the Security Council  resolution. Hence, he added, we ask our Syrian brothers -- in  light of Syria's Arab and international influence -- to help the  Yemeni people stop the fighting, implement the Security Council  resolution, abide by the internal, Arab, and international will,  and embark on dialogue.</p>

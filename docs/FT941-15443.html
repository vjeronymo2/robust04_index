			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Metallgesellschaft halt casts shadow over Frankfurt The main markets showed weakness yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT again suffered from the combined pressures of Metallgesellschaft and Siemens as the DAX index slid back another 2 per cent, closing the official section off 44.52 to 2,164.66. Mr Patrick Shields at NatWest Secutrities in London noted that the equity market had seen a shaky start to the new year, exacerbated by the fact that most investors had been confident of a promising beginning given the 46 per cent gain in the DAX during 1993. So far this year the index has shed 4.5 per cent. In the post bourse the Ibis closed at 2,142.36. Turnover was DM13.8bn. Trading in Metallgesellschaft was suspended pending a announcement from creditor banks on progress in reaching agreement on the rescue package. Two of the major shareholders, Deutsche and Dresdner banks, closed off a respective DM16.50 and DM11.00 at DM835.00 and DM442.50. Siemens slid DM36.50 at DM726.00 as it expected earnings to fall by some 10-15 per cent this year. PARIS went a further 1.3 per cent lower, the CAC-40 index down 29.71 or 1.3 per cent at 2,252.19. A day's low of 2,249.17 was recorded as turnover rose of FFr6.2bn. Alcatel Alsthom lost FFr14 to FFr778 in heavy trading. In spite of Wednesday's substantial fall after the company forecast sharply lower 1994 profits and sales James Capel has maintained its buy recommendation. While admitting that the statement came as a shock the broker's stated that Alcatel has 'restructured heavily in the face of liberalisation of the European telecommunications market and is in good shape to respond to the challenges of increased competiton'. MILAN was little changed after a day of suspense on the political front. The Comit index dipped 1.20 to 609.19, as investors awaited news of the date of the general election, which would remove a major uncertainty from the market and is widely expected to prove positive for equities. Montedison picked up L22.90 to L954.30 in volume of 80.7m shares. The recent hugh volume of trading in the share has prompted specualtion about changes in the shareholder structure. ZURICH continued the consolidation that has sent the market down by a cumulative 3.1 per cent over the last four sessions. The SMI index shed 49.1 or 1.6 per cent to 2,949.9 as weakness in other European markets and Wall Streets easier opening also weighed on the mood. Bearer shares in SMH, the watchmaker, picked up SFr20 to SFr935 after recent losses. ISTANBUL hit its sixth consecutive record in spite of a bout of profit-taking. The composite index ended up 1,616.6 at a provisional 28,883.61, for a cumulative 27.7 per cent rise over the six sessions. The buying spree has been fuelled by expectations that new tax-exempt share-based funds will be launched. WARSAW surged to an all-time high, the WIG index rising 560 or 4.1 per cent to 14,115.5. Record turnover of 2,700bn zlotys was viewed as an indication that further demand is likely to keep prices surging throughout next week.

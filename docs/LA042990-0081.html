			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ART NOTEBOOK: 'PARADISE OASIS REAL ESTATE OFFICE' SEES ARTIFICE OF GREED  </P> <P> With real estate so central to the California experience these days, it seems  only natural that art should grapple with the phenomenon.  </P> <P> In an installation titled "Paradise Oasis Real Estate Office" at SPARC, German  artist Christel Dillbohner; her husband, Gero Leson, an environmental  consultant, and three American friends take a semidocumentary look at the  ill-fated master-planned community California City.  </P> <P> Aggressively marketed as a dream location for real estate investment in the  1960s, the 90,000-lot private development languishes north of Los Angeles on  100,000 still-arid acres of Mojave Desert. Its current population is about  7,200, the artists said.  </P> <P> Using collage, photography, video, documentary displays and a full-scale  composite of a vaguely seedy real estate office -- complete down to the  business cards -- that takes up one end of the SPARC gallery, Dillbohner and  friends set out to explore some of the fundamental dreams, contradictions and  ironies of American society as manifest in the profit-driven booms and busts of  real estate.  </P> <P> Leson first came upon California City three years ago, when he got lost in a  maze of dirt roads that led nowhere while on a drive to Red Rock Canyon. He and  Dillbohner became fascinated with the sparsely inhabited settlement and its  historic analogies to the headlong development of Los Angeles and the San  Fernando Valley. Dillbohner said they were also intrigued by "the American  dream to own real estate and make fast and easy money -- and how that's taken  advantage of."  </P> <P> ? As foreigners, Leson said, he and Dillbohner were surprised to see the birth  of such a large-scale community left entirely to private developers. "It's a  form of development you don't find much in Europe, where there are more  stringent government controls and less availability of space," he said.  </P> <P> Dillbohner said, "And people still fall for the dream -- nothing has really  changed." Indeed, with prices for homes there in the $70,000 range, and lot  prices one-third that and less, according to the exhibition, California City  could look positively alluring to Angelenos.  </P> <P>  "Paradise Oasis Real Estate Office, a Parable for the American Dream," through  May 27 at the SPARC Gallery, 685 Venice Blvd., Venice. (213) 822-9560. Open 10  a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday and 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday. Artists'  lecture on the exhibition at 11 a.m. May 19.  </P> <P> BURKHARDT REDUX: Jack Rutberg Fine Arts is extending through May its extensive  show of recent pastels, paintings and mixed-media constructions by Hans  Burkhardt.  </P> <P> Burkhardt, 85, has never received the notice some feel he has deserved, partly  because he moved away from New York to Los Angeles in 1937 -- before the  Abstract Expressionist movement, with which he is generally associated, reached  full flower. Once a protege of Arshile Gorky, Burkhardt taught at Cal State  Northridge and other Los Angeles art schools.  </P> <P> Recently, interest in the artist has intensified. Last year, Burkhardt's work  was brought to the attention of the influential New York art critic Donald  Kuspit, who offered to write the catalogue essay for a recent solo show of  Burkhardt's work at Muhlenberg College in Pennsylvania.  </P> <P> Lamenting the "decades of neglect" that have befallen this artist -- some of  whose techniques predate by 20 years the well-known work of Anselm Kiefer --  Kuspit points to "his major achievement, the creation of an authentic tragic  modernist style, that is, an abstract style that could articulate a tragic  sensibility."  </P> <P> Kuspit also calls Burkhardt, who has tackled the issue of war during various  historic conflagrations, "a master -- indeed the inventor -- of the abstract  memento mori."  </P> <P>  "Hans Burkhardt, Paintings and Pastels 1988-1989" through May at Jack Rutberg  Fine Arts, 357 N. La Brea. (213) 938-5222. Open 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesday  through Friday and 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday.  </P> <P>  PACIFIC RIM PAST: Emma-Louise Hayley's shop on Melrose Avenue -- which sells  late 18th- and early 19th-Century hand-colored engravings -- isn't technically  a gallery. But its clearly arranged wares hung on well-lighted white walls make  it more suitable for looking at art than many print venues.  </P> <P> On display now, amid more predictable botanical offerings, is a small  collection of 18th-Century curiosities documenting Capt. James Cook's voyages  of discovery.  </P> <P> Hand-colored engravings, transcribed from drawings by an artist aboard the Cook  vessel, realistically portray the Pacific Island natives of the 1770s in  portraits that miss no detail of hairstyle, facial marking or headgear. Also on  view are water scenes showing the natives' sometimes surrealistically elaborate  boats.  </P> <P> "At that time, this was the way people found out about faraway places," said  Hayley. "The artist could have made the natives look pretty and much more  European, but instead they look bizarre. And I'm sure they did look bizarre  when you came upon them out of the jungle."  </P> <P>  Emma-Louise Hayley, 8642 Melrose Ave. (213) 657-9580. Open 9:30 a.m. to 5:30  p.m. Monday through Friday and 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday.  </P> <P> </P></p>

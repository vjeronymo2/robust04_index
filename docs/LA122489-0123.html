			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> LAWNDALE REJECTS PLAN FOR FILLING COUNCIL VACANCIES  </P> <P> The Lawndale City Council has unanimously rejected a proposal on filling  council vacancies that result when a council member is elected mayor, or to  another city post.  </P> <P> The proposed policy, which would have been non-binding, would have directed the  council to fill such vacancies by appointing the runner-up in the concurrent  council election. There are council elections every two years in April.  </P> <P> City Clerk Neil Roth, who offered the idea to the council Thursday night, said  the proposal was intended to save money by eliminating the need for a special  election. Roth said a special election costs the city about $25,000.  </P> <P> Under state law, when a council seat is left vacant because a council member is  elected to another post, the council must either appoint a new member or  announce a special election within 30 days.  </P> <P> In Lawndale, the mayor's term is two years while the council and clerk's terms  are for four years.  </P> <P> Councilman Larry Rudolph said the proposal was unneeded because the council  already has the option of appointing any candidate who loses a bid for a  council seat.  </P></p>

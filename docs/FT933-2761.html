			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Clinton's fight for NAFTA approval reaches Chicago PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's fight to gain Congressional approval for the North American Free Trade Agreement yesterday reached Chicago, where Mr Lloyd Bentsen, treasury secretary, addressed corporate executives, writes Laurie Morse in Chicago. The hundred or so mainly white and male chief executives who listened while lunching in Continental Bank's private banking atrium were invited because they were Nafta supporters. Labour leaders, black politicians, and grassroots environmental organisers who lead local opposition to the trade pact were absent, as were the ten members of the Illinois Congressional delegation, all Democrats, who have indicated opposition to Nafta. Earlier in the day, the Congressional Black Caucus, which includes Chicago Democrats, had released a position paper opposing Nafta, saying the minority business community had never been fully consulted or considered on it. The Illinois delegation embodies obstacles the Clinton administration must overcome for Nafta to succeed. Of the state's 20 representatives, only nine favour the agreement and only two are Democrats - yet Illinois exports to Mexico have tripled, to Dollars 1.3bn, since 1987. Mr Bentsen stressed Nafta's economic benefits to US manufactures and told the luncheon that failure to confirm Nafta would entail political risks for Mexico.</p>

			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / World Trade News: India to publish guidelines for telecoms licences The Indian government will publish guidelines this month for the licensing of private telecommunications operators, including overseas companies, but licences are not expected to be issued until next year. Mr Nagarajan Vittal, the senior official responsible for Indian telecoms policy, said the new guidelines would specify the terms on which the state's existing telecoms monopoly will be abolished and private operators allowed to provide services. 'I would expect to see the first new operators licensed within three to six months after that,' he said at the Asia-Pacific Telecommunity conference in Bangkok. However, Mr Vittal indicated that an intense debate was continuing between the Telecom Commission, which he chairs, and the government, which is under strong pressure from India's state telecoms operators and trade unions to limit the degree and speed of liberalisation. 'They are afraid that the new competitors will be very quick in establishing themselves, and they are arguing this strongly at the centres of power,' he said. India has barely eight telephone lines per 1,000 people, and is looking to private companies, including foreign groups, to invest up to Dollars 5bn over the next three years to help meet the country's target of increasing its number of lines from 8m to at least 16m. Warning those opposed to reform, Mr Vittal said there was a danger of 'too much navel-gazing' while demand remained unmet. 'Several other countries in the region are making much faster progress than us,' he said, noting that India was competing with 'at least 60 other countries' to attract foreign investment in telecoms. More than 50 proposals have been put forward by private operators for providing basic telephony services, either in competition or co-operation with existing state operators. Overseas operators expressing interest include US West, Motorola and AT&amp;T of the US, Siemens of Germany, and Fujitsu of Japan. The guidelines will cover the terms on which private operators will be licensed and the proportion of foreign equity allowed in new undertakings. They will also include details of a new regulatory authority to be established to underpin the new competitive regime. Mr Vittal said legislation would probably be required to establish the regulatory authority, but the government would be free to license new operators without recourse to special legislation.</p>

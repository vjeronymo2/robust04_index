			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Commission censured over car agreement The European Court yesterday censured the European Commission for failing to investigate a long-standing Anglo-Japanese market-sharing agreement covering Japanese car imports into the UK. The Luxembourg-based Court of First Instance said the Commission had made a 'manifest error' of judgment in March 1992 when it declined to investigate the 17-year-old pact. The deal, between the Japanese Automobile Manufacturers' Association and the UK's Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, was known as a 'gentlemen's agreement'. It formally required only that the Japanese market its cars 'prudently' in the UK. Effectively, however, it limited the market share for Japanese cars to 11 per cent. The Court's intervention - which followed a complaint by BEUC, the European consumer bureau, and the UK-based National Consumer Council - last night appeared to throw the SMMT into confusion because the 'gentlemen's agreement' was formally ended in 1992. This followed completion of an agreement between the EU Commission and Japan's Ministry of Trade and Industry. This devised a formula for controlling Japanese car imports on a Europe-wide basis during a transition to a completely open EU market for cars by 1999 where informal import ceilings for each country are reviewed twice a year. Under the EU-Miti accord, all previous national restrictions on Japanese car imports became illegal. Both France and Italy had much tighter restrictions than the UK. The SMMT said it was taking legal advice about the ruling but 'we don't understand what the court is talking about. The agreement finished in 1992 and the Commission was duly informed of that'. The Commission said yesterday it was digesting the implications of the ruling. BEUC brought the case on the grounds that the arrangement between the British and Japanese manufacturers associations made prices higher and infringed EU competition law. The Commission argued that the pact affected only a small proportion of trade between EU member states.</p>

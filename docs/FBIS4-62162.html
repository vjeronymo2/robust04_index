			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Konstantin Pribytkov] </F>   [Text] Geneva May 13 TASS -- Russian envoy to former  Yugoslavia Vitaliy Churkin believes the Vienna agreements on the  borders of the Muslim-Croatian federation in Bosnia need to be  thoroughly analysed in order to determine how they affect the  Bosnian Serbs.    "It is necessary to find out how do they correspond to the  general settlement process which also includes Bosnian Serbs",  he told TASS late on Thursday adding that "in particular, the  size of the territory on which the parties plan to create the  Croatian-Muslim federation needs an attentive consideration".    The Russian envoy also said that the work of the "contact  group" which spent two weeks in Bosnia-Herzegovina will become  "an element of the general mosaic" to be discussed on Friday by  foreign ministers of Russia, the United States and five EU  countries.</p>

He addressed on Tuesday an international conference on  Russia's federal structure and the implementation of the  principles of pluralistic democracy, rule-of-law state and human  rights. Federalisation does not mean the weakening of the  state. It means an opportunity to combine rich potentials of  all regions and democratic unification of society, Shakhray  said. A new form of state structure has emerged and is  developing. The notion of federalism includes economic and  territorial aspects.    The new constitution ensures equal rights of all subjects of  the federation, Shakhray said. He pointed to the importance of  working out various forms in integration within Russia. The  initial experience in this respect is the activity of  interregional economic associations in whose framework subjects  with different status interact.    The constitution laid down the principles of self-regulation  of the federation, the minister said. Preserving Russia's  character it registered the possibility of regulating processes  of the separation of powers by federal and other treaties. It  deals with matters that are in the competence of subjects and  joint competence of central authorities and regions. A treaty  with Tatarstan that may be concluded today is based on these  articles of the constitution.    Prevention and settlement of ethnic conflicts is the  priority  task, the minister said. He believes these conflicts are  caused by redivision of power, of property, by organised crime.    Shakhray said the ethnic form of conflicts is a most  convenient camouflage for real aims of certain political forces.  The Russian Federation is the common house where there is room  for all forms of self-organisation -- republics, regions,  autonomies, Shakhray said.</p>

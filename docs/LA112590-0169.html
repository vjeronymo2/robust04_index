			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHICAGOAN WHO LOVES PLANES STARTS HIS ROUND-THE-WORLD-IN-3-DAYS TREK  </P> <P> Trey Urbahn had his head in the clouds Saturday as the lifelong airplane lover  soared through the sky in an attempt to fly around the world in three days.  </P> <P> He took off Friday on an American Airlines flight from O'Hare International  Airport for San Juan, Puerto Rico -- the first leg of a 27,808-mile trek.  </P> <P> He hopes to land a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records. If Urbahn, 32,  arrives home as scheduled at 10:16 a.m. Monday on United Flight 44 from  Honolulu, he will have covered six continents and every time zone.  </P> <P> Urbahn, a United Airlines employee who lives in the Chicago area, said he has  been considering the global trip by commercial airline for three or four years.  </P> <P> "I noticed two or three months ago that all the schedules fit like a jigsaw  puzzle. So I wrote to the airlines and most agreed to sponsor me to some  extent."  </P> <P> After the stop in San Juan, Urbahn was heading to Caracas, Venezuela; London;  Cairo; Singapore; Sidney, Australia; Honolulu, and then back to Chicago. In  all, six different airlines are involved.  </P> <P> Urbahn will have to hope for the best as far as delays are concerned. His  tightest connection will be in London, where he has 65 minutes to change  terminals for a flight to Egypt.  </P></p>

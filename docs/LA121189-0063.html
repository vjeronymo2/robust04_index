			<p><P> December 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Author, Author: Fifth-grader Eleanor Ray of Fountain Valley launched her  writing career with an exclusive interview from former President Ronald Reagan,  held at his Century City offices last week. The 10-year-old, representing a  national children's magazine, quizzed Reagan on tough issues: Could he play a  musical instrument? Reagan pulled out a harmonica and hit some notes. What was  the worst part of being President? "Sending soldiers into battle," Reagan  replied. What was the best part?', "Being able to change things," he said.  </P> <P> Ray's parents accompanied her and videotaped the event.  </P> <P> Senior Version: Fresno entrepreneur Max Wegerbauer, 53, has come up with a  Sensuous Seniors calendar featuring "golden oldie" women, ages 50 to 73. The  calendar "girls," all from the San Joaquin valley, include a former Ice Capades  skater, an artist who lifts weights and plays the flute and a school employee  who bounces on a trampoline.  </P> <P> "First I thought of using people like Jane Fonda, Tina Turner and Lena Horne. I  couldn't afford them. And people would say they were the exception to the  rule," said Wegerbauer, whose goal is to show that older women can be, well,  womanly.  </P> <P> Cold Warrior: Author Tom Clancy, master of Iron Curtain thrillers, says he's  not worried that warming relations between the super-powers will put his career  on ice. Pretending to point a gun at a questioner, Clancy said, "I stand like  this for 30 years, and then the 31st year I say, 'Hey, you're not such a bad  guy after all,' but I don't move. Would you still be worried?"  </P> <P> Clancy said he'll find plenty of grist for his best-selling novels of  U.S.-Soviet conflict as long as the Soviet Union remains a communist military  power.  </P> <P> Red Baiter: A gigantic lobster named Lobzilla was spared a date with a pot of  boiling water after a wave of public sympathy. He was flown from North Carolina  to Maine by an animal rights group, and there returned to the ocean. The  21-pound lobster almost got cooked and served in Shucker's Oyster Bar in  Charlotte, but the animal rights group raised a cry and restaurant manager Kurt  Larkins gave Lobzilla to the group, gratis. The lobster measured more than 3  feet.  </P> <P> "He's beautiful, truly majestic," said Cam MacQueen of People for the Ethical  Treatment of Animals. She accompanied Lobzilla, who traveled in an icebox  labeled: "Eat beans, not beings." She estimated the creature is 150 years old.  </P></p>

			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Nurses to vote on hospital strike NURSES at University College Hospital in London are to vote on strike action. The move follows a proposal by Camden and Islington Health Authority to withdraw all contracts from UCH and Middlesex Hospital. Unison, the public service union, said the proposal would result in the closure of both hospitals. The union added that a similar ballot was being considered for nurses at Middlesex Hospital.</p>

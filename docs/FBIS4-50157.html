Principal responsible comrades of the six prefectures and Lhasa  city and various departments and bureaus of the regional  government attended the meeting.

To further promote the development of the progressive cause  of the unity of various nationalities in our country, the State  Council decided to solemnly hold in Beijing this September the  second national meeting on commending advanced units and  individuals for promoting the unity of various nationalities.  At the national meeting, the State Council will commend  advanced collectives and individuals who have made outstanding  contributions to promoting the unity of various nationalities in  recent years. The second national meeting on commending  advanced units and individuals for promoting the unity of  various nationalities has allocated a quota of 19 advanced  collectives and 19 advanced units in this region to be selected  to attend the national meeting.    The regional party committee and the regional government  have  attached great importance to the activities of evaluating and  selecting advanced units and individuals. A joint meeting of  the party and government was held in the region on 24 April to  hear reports and to study how to evaluate advanced units and  individuals in this region. A regional leading group for  evaluating and selecting advanced units and individuals to  attend the national commendation meeting was established to  strengthen leadership over the work of evaluating and selecting  advanced units and individuals and to make overall arrangements  for the work.    At the 12 May meeting, Danzim, deputy secretary of the  regional party committee, made a speech. He said: The  political situation and social order generally are stable, and  the economic situation is also good. However, because of the  instigation for dissension by splittist forces and the  ineffectiveness of our media and educational work, some problems  and tendencies which must not be overlooked have emerged. Under  such circumstances, properly evaluating and selecting advanced  units and individuals in this region to attend the second  national meeting on commending advanced units and individuals  for promoting the unity of various nationalities; vigorously  commending a number of advanced typical examples in promoting  national unity, and using eloquent facts to demonstrate national  unity and harmony in this region and the new situation of  promoting prosperity by people of various nationalities will be  of particular importance to further promoting the cause of  making progress through national unity.    Comrade Danzim called on leading cadres at various levels to  pay attention to and to strengthen their leadership over the  work of evaluating and selecting advanced units and individuals.  The top party and government leaders of various prefectures and  Lhasa city and of various regional departments and bureaus as  well as leading comrades assigned to the work must personally  check the work, make arrangements, and ensure the success of the  work. Various prefectures and Lhasa city should all set up  leading groups to take charge of evaluating, selecting, and  examining advanced units and individuals in promoting national  unity, and they must publicize the work. Those leading groups  should properly guide various units to carry out related  activities on promoting progress through national unity.    Deputy Secretary Danzim emphatically pointed out: If  political problems occur because leading cadres do not assume  full responsibility and if there are bad social consequences  because of the selection of unqualified units and people, the  related organizations and their leading cadres must be  investigated for their responsibility.    Deputy Secretary Danzim called on party and government  organizations at various levels to extensively publicize the  significance of this work and qualifications in evaluating and  selecting advanced units and individuals, to hold various types  of mobilization meetings, and to encourage the masses to give  full play to democracy and to recommend [for commendation]  advanced units and individuals for promoting national unity.  Various organizations should consider the current activities of  evaluating and selecting advanced units and individuals as an  opportunity to create a situation in which everyone will  advocate national unity, do good and actual things to promote  national unity, and vie with one another to become advanced  models in promoting national unity. The whole society should  protect and enhance the good atmosphere of national unity so as  to promote economic development and all-round social progress in  this region.</p>

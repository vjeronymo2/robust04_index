			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Letter: Success of warehouse clubs in US Sir, The fundamental success of the warehouse clubs in the US is based on a number of key factors ('Superstores under threat', March 24). They have hypermarket-type advantages of scale and cost efficiencies. They have the unique advantage of mixing trade (wholesale) and consumer retail sales. With very high labour productivity and cheap rents, the clubs can afford to live on 10 to 12 per cent gross margins. The clubs are a type of larger second-generation out-of-town Kwik Save or Aldi, with a wider range of foods and non-foods. Their ultimate strength is more as a retail discounter than a wholesaler. Their competitive positioning in the UK, assuming retail planning consents, is more a threat to retail superstores/discounters than to cash-and-carry wholesaling. The UK cash-and-carry sector, carrying a very full (rather than limited) food range, can operate on 5 to 7 per cent gross margins and is already on best or near-best supplier buying terms. Clubs needing more margin will not always stock brand leaders, and will not initially have a UK critical mass of buying power. On a straight retail discount basis, the estimate of 30 units in 10 years can be multiplied by at least a factor of two. Jim Lowe, JL Consultants, 18 Regent Road, Altrincham, Cheshire</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Khartoum, 26 May (SUNA) -- Sudan has expressed its  condemnation of all attempts at division and fragmentation and  the lies of the advocates of the right to self-determination for  illusory racial entities.    The Foreign Ministry said in a statement issued yesterday to  mark the 31st anniversary of the OAU's establishment, that the  anniversary comes at a time when the continent is becoming  marginalized as part of the so-called new world order. It  called for more solidarity, vigilance, and unity in the face of  the conspiracies being hatched against the African continent.</p>

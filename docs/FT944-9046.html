			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Shortage of skills hits west Midlands More companies in the west Midlands are finding it difficult to recruit the labour they need than at any time since winter 1990, according to an area business survey. The West Midlands Business Survey, covering 931 companies in the region and published yesterday, shows that 29 per cent of companies consider labour recruitment has become more difficult. This compares with 15 per cent six months ago and about 10 per cent for 1991-93, when the recession was felt most acutely. Historically, skill shortages have tended to emerge quickly in the west Midlands as economic recovery leads to employment growth. The survey says there is 'clear evidence of a tightening of the labour market in spite of a comparatively high level of unemployment reported in official statistics'. In both spring and autumn 1994 44 per cent of companies reported taking on more personnel. Between spring and autumn the proportion of companies shedding labour dropped to 18 per cent from 25 per cent. This has been accompanied by signs of rising wage levels. The proportion of companies reporting wage and salary rises of more than 5 per cent has risen to 21 per cent from 16 per cent in the spring. By contrast with previous surveys, the latest survey illustrates the problems of recovery. Evidence of skill shortages is accompanied by complaints about rising raw material costs. More than half of companies reported raw material and other input price rises of more than 5 per cent, compared with slightly more than one-third six months ago.

He said that the session had fulfilled its task,  despite the fact that the deputies did not cover all the issues  on the agenda. In his opinion, "the approval of the  socioeconomic development plan and the budget of the Republic of  Crimea for this year, and the confirmation of the appointment of  the new government's deputy prime minister set the necessary  work environment for the new executive power."    The Supreme Council chairman believes, however, that this  was  the last session of Crimea's present Supreme Council. It will  be impossible to convene a new session, he said, since the  majority of parliamentarians are involved in the election  campaign to keep their seats. Asked what political forces he  thinks would win in the upcoming election, he said that  candidates of the Rossiya bloc and the Communists stood the best  chance of winning the biggest vote. "The Party of Economic  Revival and the Union in Support of the Republic of Crimea are  also likely to gain seats, but the new parliament will be a  complex one."    Crimea's Supreme Council chairman reiterated his opinion on  the priority of economic problems on the peninsula. He does not  believe it sensible to hold the Crimea-wide poll on 27 March  according to Yuriy Meshkov's decree, as it would have no legal  force. As for the issue of lifting the moratorium on the  referendum about Crimea's independence which is set to be  examined at the next session, the Crimean Supreme Council  chairman described it as yet another political gamble by those  reluctant to leave their Supreme Council seats. "If the Crimean  card continues to be played, if there is no peace and stability  on the peninsula, then the investments so necessary to overcome  the economic crisis will remain Yevhen Saburov's and his  government's dream," Mykola Bahrov stressed.    Mykola Bahrov also declared his negative attitude to the  resolution by Ukraine's Supreme Council obliging Crimea to bring  its legislation in line with the Ukrainian laws within a month:  In his opinion, this is not a realistic deadline.    Asked what he thought of Yuriy Meshkov's statement  circulated  in the media about the need to withdraw military formations from  the territory of the autonomous republic, Mykola Bahrov said:  "Be realistic. Crimea is Ukraine's border zone, therefore, its  troops have to be deployed here."</p>

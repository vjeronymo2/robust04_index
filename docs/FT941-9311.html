			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Survey of Housing Associations (3): Honesty and ability - Management standards are on trial Fraud and corruption, and the paler although sometimes more expensive evils of mismanagement and incompetence, are not unknown in the private sector. When they occur in statutory or voluntary organisations, however, they raise particular concern because of the likelihood that public money will be involved. A recent spate of public sector problems - many of them brought together in a report from the Commons public accounts committee last month - has unleashed serious questions about the quality of management and accountability arrangements in the increasing variety of agencies, quangos and charities that handle a large volume of public funds. Many such organisations are already examining their management and governance structures, and the housing association movement is about to join them. The National Federation of Housing Associations has set up a wide-ranging, independent inquiry into governance issues that will begin work by March. Interest in management and decision-making in the public and voluntary sectors has not only been stimulated by recent specific examples of things going wrong. The Cadbury committee's report on the financial aspects of corporate governance in private companies started a debate on the extent to which its principles might be applied in other sectors of the economy. And the 1992 Charities Act, by reiterating the responsibilities of charity trustees, has forced the voluntary sector to question the adequacy of trustee selection, training and accountability arrangements. Such issues are of particular importance to housing associations, given the exceptionally large sums of both public and private funds for which they are responsible. Some housing associations are charitable trusts; some function under provident society law, some under Housing Corporation registration. The national federation's inquiry will consider the pros and cons of various forms of status and whether there is a case for rationalisation. This will raise complex issues on which there is unlikely to be unanimity within the movement. Some associations, for example, believe there are advantages in housing associations being perceived as charities and would be loath to lose charitable status; on the other hand, charity law places restrictions on associations' activities. The inquiry team is likely to consist of a housing association chief executive, a lay committee member, a lawyer, an academic and a private sector representative with experience of the Cadbury recommendations. Among the issues addressed by the inquiry will be the respective roles of committee members and housing association management. This central corporate governance issue - defining the relationship between executive and non-executive directors - is currently the subject of debate throughout the voluntary sector, and elsewhere in areas such as the National Health Service. The debate has, however, been heightened in the housing association movement by recent suggestions that lay board members - or at least chairmen and women - should receive salaries. This is a controversial suggestion in an area which has strong voluntary sector origins and traditions. But Mr Anthony Mayer, chief executive of the Housing Corporation, believes the governance of housing associations is ready for an overhaul and is prepared for radical change. 'The present structure was devised in 1975 and housing associations have outgrown it,' he says. 'In many towns, a local housing association is the largest private sector spender, yet the regime under which they are operating is way behind the role. 'Association committees need to make sure that they have the members and the expertise to cope with business challenges such as modernising internal controls, treasury management, borrowing strategies and so on. 'Paying committee members might interfere with the voluntary ethos. But if you paid committee members, you would establish a contract between them and the organisation. Without pay, you are relying entirely on the good will of people to give up their time. 'Having the chief executive sitting on the committee and sharing its accountability could also cement more closely the relationship between the executive and the committee. My own view is that the answers on these questions are not clearcut, but it is vital that they are addressed head-on and some proper answers established.' Full-time managers and non-executive lay members sharing responsibility on a single board - the model adopted in the NHS since the 1991 reforms - would, say its advocates, enhance decision-making and clarify accountability. But this approach, allied to paying committee members, is considered too commercial by some association managers and committee members. They believe that a lay committee considering broad policy issues at arms-length from executive management remains essential. Any organisation's lay committee is of true value only if the members are properly selected, trained and aware of their responsibilities. A recent study showed that many charity trustees did not even appreciate that they were trustees, and lacked understanding of their legal duties. The National Council for Voluntary Organisations has, with government financial support, set up a unit to help prepare trustees and management committee members for their responsibilities. It has published a resource guide for governing bodies and established a telephone helpline (071-833 1818) which provides committee members with advice on legal, financial and managerial responsibilities. Housing associations often seek to strengthen the skills of full-time management teams by recruiting people with business skills to their committees. But the affairs of Circle 33 housing trust - where a Pounds 1m maintenance fraud is under investigation - demonstrate that even the most impressive committees cannot guarantee protection against criminal activity or deliberate, concealed mismanagement. Its board included Mr Mark Boleat, director general of the Association of British Insurers, and Ms Colette Bowe, a senior Securities and Investment Board official who has been selected as chief executive of the proposed Personal Investment Authority.</p>

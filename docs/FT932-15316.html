			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / The Lex Column: ICI The 20 per cent target return on capital set by Mr Ronnie Hampel, heir to ICI's chemicals side, is less stringent than it sounds. A five year pay-back on new investment is close to being an industry standard. On a mixed bag of new and fully depreciated plant, return on capital is difficult to measure. Since ICI is shy about the distribution of capital across the group, the market will hardly be in a position to judge whether the target has been met. Mr Hampel could pin his colours firmly to the mast by setting a target rate of return on sales. If the target is applied honestly, though, ICI will be in for radical reshaping. The chemicals side returned 3.7 per cent on net assets last year, based on operating profits of Pounds 146m before exceptionals and shareholders' funds of Pounds 4bn. That is some way from Mr Hampel's minimum rate of return of 10 per cent in the trough, even allowing for restructuring benefits to come. One answer may be for ICI to steer away from capital-intensive industries. But that decision is by no means clear cut. Tioxide has delivered an average return on net assets of 27 per cent over 20 years - a performance flattered by years of low investment, which depressed the asset base and reduced depreciation. Shorn of cash-generative pharmaceuticals, cash flow may be a bigger constraint. Paying an uncovered, uncut dividend will cost ICI Pounds 200m this year. The latest round of restructuring carries a cash cost of Pounds 250m over three years, on top of residual costs from earlier slimming. Industries such as petrochemicals which feature big capital projects may seem too risky whatever the rate of return.</p>

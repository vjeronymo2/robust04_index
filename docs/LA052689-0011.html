			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEAR CLAUDE PEPPER. . .  </P> <P> Rep. Claude Pepper (D-Fla.), the oldest member of Congress, is 88 and ailing.  He deserves our affectionate attention and praise because of the difference he  has made in the lives of senior citizens, poor workers, sick children and other  Americans in need.  </P> <P> Long a friend of the elderly, Pepper has been a guardian of Medicare and Social  Security. His reluctant support of compromises to keep the system solvent  proved persuasive six years ago. Older men and women can work longer because  his efforts to raise the minimum mandatory retirement age from 65 to 70 became  law a decade ago.  </P> <P> Idealistic and an "ideological soul mate" of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's  New Deal, Pepper, a Harvard-educated lawyer, began his congressional career  with his election to the Senate from Florida in 1936. A year later, he  sponsored the bill that created the National Cancer Institute and paved the way  for the other national institutes of health. Two years later, he pushed for  passage of the minimum wage, although the proposal was politically unpopular in  the South.  </P> <P> Putting principles before politics led to the end of Pepper's Senate career.  Derisively nicknamed "Red" Pepper, he was smeared as a friend of Communists and  black Americans during a dirty and disgraceful campaign. A former protege,  George A. Smathers, beat him in 1950.  </P> <P> Claude Pepper returned to Congress when he was elected to the House from Miami  in 1962. He is a champion to his district and to his national constituency --  Americans who need help.  </P></p>

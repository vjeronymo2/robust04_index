			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TRABUCO CHURCH  </P> <P> Re your lengthy treatise on the fate of Trabuco Canyon (Aug. 6): It's tragic  enough to contemplate the addition of 4,833 homes and a major thoroughfare in  one of the last bastions of sanity in Orange Canyon. But the prospect of  Saddleback Community Church wanting to erect something even more intrusive than  the Crystal Cathedral boggles my mind. I can't believe God would prefer that  man should build a massive edifice in His name, such as is proposed, to the  pacific, natural beauty that He created.  </P> <P> JANET BRENNAN  </P> <P> Trabuco Canyon  </P></p>

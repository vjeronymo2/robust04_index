			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;327.6(a) would clarify the assessment obligation for these transfers. Section 7 of the FDI Act says the FDIC must base an institution's assessment on the probability that the appropriate deposit insurance fund will incur a loss with respect to the institution. Section 7 further specifies that the FDIC must take into account the likely amount of any such loss. 12 U.S.C. 1817(b)(1). Accordingly, proposed &sect;327.6(a) would call for the buyers_the institutions that would present a continuing insurance risk to the FDIC for the deposits_to pay assessments that reflect that risk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;327.6(a) would achieve this goal by adjusting the buyers' assessment bases upward. The proposed rule would call for each buyer's assessment base to be increased by that buyer's ``pro rata share'' of the seller's first-quarter assessment base: that is, by the ratio of the deposits that the buyer assumes from the seller to the seller's total quarter-end deposits. The proposed regulation would correspondingly reduce the seller's assessment base. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> This latter provision may seem superfluous. In virtually all such cases the seller would cease to exist before the end of the transfer period. Sometimes, however, a related series of transfers could extend beyond the end of a semiannual period. In that case, the seller would still be in existence at the start of the following period. The seller would make a second-quarter payment based on its first-quarter assessment base. Absent this latter provision, the FDIC would in effect be assessing the same deposits twice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This formula is designed to be relatively simple, and to be satisfactory for most cases. A seller generally transfers all its deposits at the same time, even when several buyers assume the deposits. In a few cases, a seller may transfer its deposits to several buyers over an interval: but even then, the interval tends to be short, and the seller tends to decline in size (if it changes in size at all). The formula would function properly under these conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> But the formula would not, on its own, accommodate cases in which a seller's volume of deposits increases between the end of the quarter and the date of the transfer. In that event, the buyers would assume more deposits than the seller reported in its report of condition. The formula would cause the buyers' collective assessment bases to increase by an amount greater than the seller's quarter-end assessment base.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;327.6(a) addresses this difficulty by putting a cap on the aggregate amount by which the buyers' assessment bases could be increased. The FDIC considers that it would be justified in collecting an aggregate assessment based on the seller's quarter-end assessment base, because the seller itself would pay such an assessment if the seller remained in existence. But, by the same token, the FDIC would not be justified in collecting an aggregate assessment based on a higher amount.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nor would the formula, on its own, accommodate more elaborate deposit-transfer arrangements. For example, a buyer may be acting merely as an intermediary, or a transfer may be only incidental to other mergers or deposit-assumptions. In such cases, the formula might not accurately reflect the likely amount of the loss that the buyer_or the other institutions_ultimately pose to their insurance funds in the upcoming period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FDIC does not believe it is possible to foresee all the special situations that might arise in complex cases. Proposed &sect;327.6(a) accordingly would give the FDIC a limited flexibility to adjust a buyer's or seller's assessment base. The proposed rule would specify that the FDIC may use this authority only to bring an institution's assessment base into line with the true magnitude of the likely amount of the loss that the institution poses for the upcoming quarter_that is, with the institution's true deposit-base at the beginning of that quarter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It must be emphasized that proposed &sect;327.6(a) would only apply to institutions that participate directly in a transfer (or related series of such transactions), or that participate in transactions directly related to such a transaction (for example, an institution that assumes deposits from a buyer). Furthermore, the authority would not mean that the FDIC could consider other risk factors_ones unrelated to the volume of deposits transferred_in determining the likely amount of the loss.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

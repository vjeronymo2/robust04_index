			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> ROSAS PITCHES SANTA ANA TO VICTORY  </P> <P> Jesse Rosas was the winning pitcher in Santa Ana High School's 4-2 Century  League baseball victory over Foothill Tuesday at Foothill.  </P> <P> But it wasn't easy.  </P> <P> Rosas (3-2) threw more than 100 pitches and walked six but finished with a  three-hitter. He needed only 68 pitches Friday at Canyon, but lost, 2-1.  </P> <P> "Jesse was all over the place today," Santa Ana Coach Bill Ross said. "But I  guess he threw it in the right places at the right times."  </P> <P> Foothill also hit the ball at the right people at the right times for Santa  Ana. That often meant within diving range of Octavio Medina, Santa Ana's  slick-fielding shortstop.  </P> <P> With two outs in the first, Medina sprawled to his right to knock down a  chopper by Shawn Sousa, and threw in time to retire Sousa.  </P> <P> In the second, Medina turned an acrobatic double play to help Rosas out of  trouble again.  </P> <P> Santa Ana got just enough timely hitting. Trailing, 2-1, in the third, Santa  Ana tied the score when Rosas drove in Bill Johnson with a single to center.  </P> <P> In the fourth, Medina and Jeff Fuentes walked with two outs, and both scored on  John Morales' line single up the middle. That gave Santa Ana the lead for good.  </P> <P> Both teams are 4-4 overall, 1-1 in league. STUART MATTHEWS  </P></p>

			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Books: A lost world down the mine COMING BACK BROCKENS by Mark Hudson Cape Pounds 16.99, 310 pages Mark Hudson is the author of an excellent and fascinating book telling of his stay in a village in the Gambia: Our Grandmothers' Drums. Here, in Coming Back Brockens he applies a rather similar first-person, not-quite-anthropological approach to a village closer to home and to his heart - Horden in the Durham coalfield. 'My father's family were miners,' he begins, 'working the narrow seams five miles out under the North Sea, lying in spaces only 18 inches deep, often in water, hacking into the coal with picks or a primitive coal-cutting machine called a nig-nog.' Hudson goes back to live for nine months in the village so often described to him by his father, who had escaped, through education, this underground fate. He tracks down family, looks up old men, talks with retired managers and union officials, finds 'the last communist in Horden' and the women who fought in 1985. He is exploring a doomed society, a lost world: Horden, once the biggest colliery in Britain, 'moderate' in that it did not support Arthur Scargill, closed down after the 1984-1985 strike. There used to be 188 pits nationally, and now, in the old Durham area, there are none. Today, in Hudson's appalled account, there is a society in decay, a society which has cut back on its ambitions, where children have less faith in education than they ever did, where the village is less able to cope with its anti-social members, where economic, social and cultural deprivation are winning out over the traditional qualities of 'stoic cheerfulness, the unassuming generosity and gallantry'. He has an unashamedly sentimental view of the old society: the knocking-up slate by the front door so the 'carler' could wake the men for the first shift; the great-grandfather who did not allow his back to be washed because that was the source of his strength; the role of the Primitive Methodists in the early 19th century; the 'wands' of the under-managers; the constant danger, and the utterly limited expectations of the men who risked their lives every day. It is an ill-organised, sometimes exasperating tale of a nine-month journey back into family history, but Hudson writes well and he knows the nature of his task, which is to raise a memorial to his forebears. That is worth a book. 'Of course, it had been awful. One knew it had been awful. But the awfulness had all been part of the richness, and, dare one even think it, the romance of that world . . .' And by the end he has discovered that the coal seams were not 18 inches but nearer three feet high.</p>

			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Managua LA PRENSA in Spanish of 25 March  1994 on page 20 reports that the movement of 40 mestizo families  into Miskito communities in the Wina and Amak territories is the  source of potential conflict between the two groups. According  to Nelson Lopez, coordinator of the Bosawas project, the lack of  clearly defined agrarian policies and the pressure by landless  peasants for land are complicating the issue. Levalth Matute,  supreme leader of the Miskitos, stated: "We are the historic  owners of these territories which are now being deforested by  the mestizos to such an extent that the land is being turned  into cattle ranches. We are extremely concerned about this."  Miskito leaders pointed out that the Bosawas preserve should be  maintained and that penetration by peasant families be halted.  The article reports that to prevent conflicts the Bosawas  project, which is sponsored by the Ministry of Environment and  Natural Resources, is urging that deeds be issued to the owners  of indigenous lands.</p>

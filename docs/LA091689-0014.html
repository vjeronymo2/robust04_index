			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COVERAGE OF ZSA ZSA'S DAY IN COURT  </P> <P> Is Zsa Zsa Gabor trying to prove how far a "has-been" or a "never-was" will go  to gain publicity? She must live a very boring life if she needs excitement  this much. Mostly I resent that her nonsense is taking up valuable court time  and the time of 12 jury members and alternates.  </P> <P> Obviously, she was in the wrong if she had no driver's license with her so why  the big court deal? But maybe 60 days in jail with the "common folk" would wake  her up. Let's hope she doesn't make a mockery of our court system.  </P> <P> JANET GARRETT  </P> <P> Alhambra  </P></p>

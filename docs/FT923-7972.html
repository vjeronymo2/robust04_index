			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Royal Insurance Accounting smoke and mirrors may persuade Royal's management that life is not so bad, but the markets will take more convincing. At first sight, the transfer of Royal Life to the group's holding company increases Royal Insurance's solvency ratio from an uncomfortable 26 per cent to a near average 40 per cent. But the improvement is as cosmetic as it is startling; other composite insurers would also increase their ratios in varying degrees if they accounted in the same way. An unkind observer might conclude that Royal had sought a buyer for its life operations, but could find only itself. The timing of the reorganisation is interesting. The move has not been prompted by the regulators, or by the possibility of brokers switching business to companies with stronger balance sheets. But the management clearly feels a need to present its composite business in a better light. At the operating level things remain difficult. The company has raised its estimate of losses on mortgage indemnities from around Pounds 175m to Pounds 250m in only three months. A decision to focus on higher quality business and reduced market share may be sensible, and some sectors show the benefit of premium increases. But with the balance sheet already weakened, props for the share price are being knocked away. Total dividends this year might come to 5p per share, leaving little yield support. If losses from mortgage indemnity or elsewhere rise, stated net asset value may not be a reliable guide to the share price. Investors looking to a bid for support may wait in vain. Few insurers can afford to buy and, through its exposure to mortgage indemnity, Royal may already have swallowed its own poison pill.</p>

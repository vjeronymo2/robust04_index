			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / P&amp;O to withdraw Chinese workers P&amp;O European Ferries bowed to pressure from French seafaring unions yesterday and agreed to withdraw 58 Chinese cleaners on its two most recently chartered ferries. The French unions had disrupted dockings at Cherbourg last week and spread the action yesterday to Calais, although P&amp;O had already said it would dispense with the Chinese workers. The government yesterday asked the French government to intervene in the dispute after French workers blocked the departure of a P&amp;O ferry from Calais, disrupting sailings for several hours. The dispute arose when the French seafarers complained that employment of the Chinese could drive down pay for other nationals. However, P&amp;O suggested yesterday that the action had been a smokescreen for wider fears about French ferry jobs. The company said it was reluctantly ending the employment of the Chinese on the two ships, which were previously run by Germany's Olau line. It added: 'Chinese have served on these two ships for the past four years while they were operating between the UK and the Netherlands under a German flag.' The company said it was examining the legal implications of the action.</p>

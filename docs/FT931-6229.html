			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / International Company News: US group denies interest in Greencore ARCHER-Daniels-Midlands, the US agribusiness group, yesterday quashed speculation that it planned to take a stake in Greencore, the Irish sugar and foods group which is 30 per cent owned by the government. Mr Dwayne Andreas, chairman of Illinois-based ADM, said yesterday that the group had been approached a month ago with a view to buying the Irish government's stake. However, the terms and conditions offered had been unacceptable. 'There did not seem to be any way to reach agreement,' he said. There had been no further contact. Speculation surrounding the fate of the government's stake - the legacy of the group's privatisation in 1991 - resulted in the suspension of Greencore shares at 245p yesterday. The company said the shares would be suspended for 48 hours pending clarification of the government's position on the future of its holding. The cabinet is expected to make a statement this morning. In the budget speech last month, the government said it intended to raise IPounds 150m in 12 months through the disposal of state assets - believed to be the Greencore holding and a 45 per cent stake in Irish Life. The company is believed to have held discussions with the potential investor, and it is thought unlikely a full bid would result. The govern-ment holds a golden share, and is likely to expect under-takings on certain issues such as employment and the maintaining of Ireland's sugar quota. Possible investors include Conagra and Cargill, both of the US. Reports cited an offer price of Pounds 65m for the stake, or 260p per share. The government is unlikely to accept such a price, however, having disposed of 15 per cent of Greencore last year at 265p. Analysts speculated that an offer pitched at between 270p and 275p would succeed. ADM, known to be keen to expand in Europe, was widely favoured as the most likely purchaser of the stake. ADM already owns 7.4 per cent of Tate &amp; Lyle. It was also noted that Mr Gerry Murphy, Greencore's chief executive, is known to ADM. He was formerly a senior executive of Grand Metropolitan's Pillsbury operations in the US, which has a joint venture with ADM in flour milling. Analysts in Dublin said they would welcome the sale of the government's stake. 'It would preclude Greencore fund raising in Dublin and bring at least Pounds 65m into the exchequer,' said Mr Joe Gill, an analyst with Dublin brokers, Riada. Mr Gill said speculation that Greencore would have to come to the market for funds had helped to depress the share price in recent weeks.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by S.A. Imam: "Plans To Divide Sindh?"] </F>   [Text] Mr. Altaf Hussain, leader of the MQM [Mohajir Quami  Movement] , while addressing the convention of the Mohajir  Rabita Council (Mehdood Group) directly from London by  telephone, asked mohajir [immigrants from India at the time of  partition] senior citizens why they established Pakistan. Did  they establish it so that their mothers, sister, and daughters  could be humiliated in public? Did they establish it so that the  government officials would pull the beards of our elders  [disrespect them] in public? He accused the Pakistani military  and police personnel of committing atrocities on the mohajirs  similar to those the Serbs were committing on Bosinian Muslims.  He said in his speech that while the British controlled the  sub-continent, they did not commit such atrocities on the  Muslims as are being committed on mohajirs now. In his opinion,  even Hindus during the Hindu-Muslim riots were not involved in  such activities as the Pakistani military and police personnel  are presently carrying out. The abominations and atrocious acts  that Mr. Altaf Hussain recounted one after another in his speech  are the forerunner of a major catastrophe that might occur.  Perhaps he wants to make the mohajir youth rise against the  armed forces. While spewing poison against the armed forces, he  showed his skills in public speaking and uttered dirty  obscenities against our military.    The real chairman of the MQM, Afaq Ahmed, has also expressed  his opinion at times and is trying to bring the attention of  older refugees and others to the state government's actions  against recent refugees to make them "Red Indians" of Pakistan.  Various actions such as in Maler district, Liari Development  Authority, Manghu Pir, and Qasimabad district were based purely  on ethnic consideration in order to distribute the Mohajir vote  bank in Sindh in such a way that they cannot win any seats.    Professor Ghafur Ahmed, vice chairman of Jamaat-i Islami,  said in a statement that a plan to divide Sindh on ethnic basis  is being implemented, and the problem of law and order is being  neglected. Even mohajir elders have started to openly express  their opinion at various occasions that the mohajirs were being  pushed against the wall. In this context, mohajir groups are  planning strategies to protect their interests.    The Sindh government is accused of having a prejudiced  mentality behind all of its actions. The establishment of Maler  district was declared a mischievous act of a prejudiced  bureaucrat by Iqbal Yusuf, general secretary of the PPP  [People's Party of Pakistan]. He said that he made this simple  administrative act a disputed decision by establishing specific  boundaries for this district. Abdullah Shah, chief minister of  Sindh, had no part in deciding the boundaries of this district.  Many actions such as the establishment of development agencies  for Liari and Manghu Pir districts, moving the Karachi Medical  and Dental College under the Sindh government's administration,  distribution of medical college admission seats by districts,  and transfer of some female doctors from Karachi to inner Sindh  have provided some ethnic groups the opportunities to criticize  the government. They are convinced that all these administrative  actions were against the Mohajirs. The state chief minister,  Parvez Ali Shah, and other government leaders have expressed the  opinion that all these problems can be resolved by talks. Parvez  Ali Shah had himself gone to Landhi Center to respond to the  appeal for strike issued by MQM. He had talks with the leaders  and had agreed on principle to establish a committee to continue  these talks. However, we do not know which mysterious hand has  stopped the progress of these talks and has put another block in  the resolution of the city's problems by widening the chasm  between these two groups. Parvez Ali Shah said that the MQM has  shown a lack of patience and has closed the door to more  negotiations by appealing for another strike. The leaders of the  MQM, however, complain that the government has a policy of  procrastination. Anyhow, this deadlock must be broken. Although  the government has demonstrated goodwill by taking back the  transfers of female doctors to inner Sindh and allocating  medical college seats according to district residency, the  responsibilities of the government are much more than this. It  must take the initiative to end the ethnic prejudice. This  government knows about it and Chief Minister Abdullah Shah has  expressed this opinion while meeting with the Nawaz League,  Jamaat-i Islami, and Jumiat-i Ulema Pakistan's [JUP Niazi group]  National Assembly members in Karachi. The talks and actions of  the PPP state leadership indicate that they also want to take  some serious action to resolve these problems. However, it  appears that mischief perpetuated by prejudiced individuals  prevails. The agents of some forces within the bureaucracy are  continuously trying to foil the efforts of the democratic  government. If we look at the situation from the national and  international perspective we would find that Pakistan is going  through a very critical phase. The international forces want to  play some new games using the new world order. The goals of  these forces are not achieved in a democratic government, and  martial law could be imposed on this country again. This was  hinted at by Pir Pagara's mysterious prophesy. Therefore, it is  important that all patriotic politicians agree on the issue of  national security and suggest ways to resolve the problem in  Sindh including Karachi. If they unite, the biased forces that  hatch conspiracies will be unsuccessful. Despite all their  political differences, all of them should keep in mind that  confrontations will not help anyone. Even after two world wars,  the opposing groups had to resolve their issue at the  negotiation tables. Therefore, it would be appropriate and  beneficial to take care of the Sindh issue by holding talks and  not by fighting. Otherwise, people like Iltaf Hussain will  present every government action in a negative light and will be  successful in their goals, which perhaps is what the  international imperialist powers want.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Turning Up the Heat on India"] </F>   [Text] The statement by US Secretary of State, Warren  Christopher, that India will not receive any concessions for its  nuclear programme, will have been received in Islamabad with  considerable relief. Christopher told a House subcommittee on  appropriations that the US is pursuing an even-handed policy in  South Asia, after Congressman James Moran asked some questions  about Indian violation of human rights in occupied Kashmir and  East Punjab. In recent months, the American in South Asia, and  keeping a careful eye on relations between Pakistan and India.  American policy-makers clearly see the region as a potential  flash point, and have appointed a senior State Department man,  Strobe Talbott, to watch the situation. Though generally  considered an expert in US- Soviet relations, Talbott has  probably been asked to observe the Pakistan-India situation  because of his expertise in nuclear strategy and confidence  building techniques between two hostile parties. Talbott is  expected to visit Pakistan and India next month.    Talbott's new assignment is a clear indication of how  seriously Washington is viewing the tension in South Asia. The  worst nightmare for the American administration is a  conventional confrontation between South Asia's two largest  powers, which could escalate into a nuclear conflict.  Christopher told the House sub-committee that the US wanted  India to cap its nuclear programme, which India insists is for  peaceful purposes despite concrete evidence that it is forging  ahead not only with the development of nuclear weapons  technology, but is also perfecting an indigenous delivery  system. But the key difference between Pakistan and India,  vis-a-vis the Pressler Amendment, which applies only to Pakistan  and not to India, was a subject that Mr Christopher did not  comment on when asked to do so by Congressman Moran. If the  United States is truly committed to an equal, even-handed  approach to the two countries, then the application of the  Pressler Amendment to Pakistan will have to be examined.    New Delhi will have received the new about Christopher's  statement with frigidity and some trepidation. There were also  some questions about human rights violations in occupied Kashmir  and Punjab to which Mr Christopher acknowledged that there were  more "problems" in Indo-US relations are likely to deteriorate  in this regard. There have been discernible shifts in US  foreign policy regarding India over the past few months and it  is becoming increasingly clear that American administration is  no longer as gullible as it used to be. Pakistan had felt  singled out by the US on several counts, with the general  impression being that Washington was inclined favourably towards  India on various issues. While Pakistan is still not off the  hook, India is no longer being treated with myopic favouritism.  A balanced American initiative in South Asia could go a long  way in defusing the tension in the region. The key issue will,  of course, be how even-handed American policy really will be.  Anything less will be unacceptable and equally unsuccessful.</p>

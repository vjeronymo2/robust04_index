			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / UN aid convoy lifts siege of Mostar A UN aid convoy broke through to the Moslem quarter of the embattled Bosnian city of Mostar yesterday, where 55,000 people have been trapped in a Croat-imposed siege since early June. The 27-truck convoy pulled into the Croat-held central sector of Mostar in the early evening, a UN official said. Food and medical supplies were unloaded from some of the vehicles; 19 trucks then drove to the city's Moslem east side. Croat protesters had earlier blocked the convoy for hours. The Croat forces, who have recently suffered a series of military defeats by the Moslem-led Bosnian army in central Bosnia, had demanded that aid convoys be stepped up to besieged Croat populations in the region. The convoy had been plagued by delays since crossing into Bosnia this week after the rebel Bosnian Croat command (HVO) authorised passage to Mostar's Moslems in the face of a rising international outcry over starvation fears there. Late on Tuesday night US aircraft dropped food rations to ease conditions in the Moslem quarter, sprinkling more than 13,000 food packets over the area. A further drop was made last night. Meanwhile, amid signs that the continued tension on the ground could undermine the latest peace proposals, the Dutch and German foreign ministers voiced doubts about the plan for the ethnic partition of Bosnia. The warnings came after Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international mediators, held separate meetings with Mr Pieter Kooijmans, the Dutch foreign minister, and Mr Klaus Kinkel, his German counterpart. After 90 minutes of talks, the Dutch foreign minister indicated that the Netherlands remained concerned about the feasibility of implementing the peace plan, and the practicality of putting Mostar under EC control. It is worried that the Moslems may be coming under too much pressure to accept the plan, threatening its ultimate effectiveness in practice. Mr Kinkel echoed the concern, indicating that he was not completely satisfied with the latest proposals to divide Bosnia-Hercegovina into three ethnic-based regions. The European Community is expected to delay any formal decision on whether to accept the peace plan's proposal that it take over administration of Mostar until all three parties to the Bosnian conflict make up their minds on the plan. Beyond the task of choosing an administrator, EC diplomats emphasise questions such as the number of support personnel required, how Mostar would be policed, and where funding would come from to replenish the EC's exhausted aid budget. The Community appears concerned to avoid establishing a link between accepting administration of Mostar and committing extra troops to Bosnia.</p>

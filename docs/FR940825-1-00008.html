Scope and Application <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1. General. Airport Traffic Control Towers (ATCTs) are unique structures used for the control of aircraft, usually over or near an airport facility. The distinctive mission of ATCTs requires ATCT designs that permit 360 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; visibility at the cab level and, in many cases, sufficient space for radar equipment and administrative activities related to ATCT operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. This standard applies to all ATCTs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Specific. This standard sets forth minimum fundamental requirements essential to providing a safe means of egress from fire and similar emergencies. Nothing in this standard shall be construed to prohibit a better type of building construction, more exits, or otherwise safer conditions than the minimum requirements specified herein. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Equivalent Protection. The use of alternative arrangements or construction, developed or approved by a licensed fire protection engineer, may be permitted by the authority having jurisdiction when it is shown that these features provide a level of safety to life equivalent to that required in this standard or, where this standard is silent on an issue, by other standards or codes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> b.

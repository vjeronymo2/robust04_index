			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Thatcher rebuffed in massive referendum vote BARONESS Thatcher, the former prime minister, saw her demand for a referendum on the Maastricht Treaty rejected by a massive 269 majority (445-176) last night when peers struggled through the division lobbies in what government business managers hailed as the biggest vote ever recorded in the House of Lords. Peers travelled from all quarters of the globe to attend the debate and some who are rarely seen at Westminster joined in the laughter and cheers when Lord Thomson of Monifieth (Liberal Democrat) welcomed 'so many strange and fresh faces'. Lady Thatcher was the central figure in a strongly argued debate, the outcome of which was never in doubt, in spite of her call to override government objections by voting for a referendum because it was 'the people's turn to speak'. Both Conservative and Labour peers were subject to a three-line whip against the referendum, while the Liberal Democrats were accorded a free vote. In a powerful speech, Lady Thatcher brushed aside warnings from some of her former cabinet colleagues that by backing a referendum, peers would endanger the government and risk a constitutional clash with the Commons. She maintained that it was 'not a matter of confidence in the government' because all the political parties were divided over the treaty. Government supporters nodded with approval when Lord Rawlinson of Ewell (C), a former attorney-general, suggested that Lady Thatcher was as embittered as Sir Edward Heath over being toppled from the leadership of the Tory party. He urged peers 'not to be used by those engaging in a political vendetta to destroy the government and the prime minister'. Lady Thatcher again insisted that the treaty would lead to the diminution of the authority of the British parliament and courts. The people should be allowed to speak, she declared, because the powers belonged to them while parliament's role was that of custodian. Before her speech Lady Thatcher sat for three hours impassively making notes as she was subjected to concentrated criticism from Tory peers who had worked closely with her in government. Lord Howe, the former foreign secretary and chancellor whose resignation speech in the Commons triggered her departure from 10 Downing Street in 1990, recalled that occasion by again resorting to a cricketing metaphor. Ridiculing suggestions that by voting for a referendum the Lords would act as a 'long stop', he said it would be like gathering up the ball when it was almost out of the ground. Viscount Whitelaw, one of Lady Thatcher's most influential confidants when he served as deputy prime minister, told peers that by supporting a referendum they would be seen to be seeking to usurp the 'leading role' of the Commons. In a notable maiden speech, Lord Lawson, the former chancellor, opposed a referendum on the treaty, but accepted that it would be an appropriate device to use if a future government sought to commit Britain to a single European currency and a single central bank. He said: 'Unless and until that time arrives - and for a number of reasons I rather doubt it ever will - I do not believe that the case for a referendum is made'. Lord Blake (C), who moved the referendum amendment to the Maastricht Bill, said there was a strong moral case for letting the people have their say. He insisted: 'The British people have a right to be consulted so they can endorse, or otherwise, a measure which irrevocably and irreversibly affects their governance.'</p>

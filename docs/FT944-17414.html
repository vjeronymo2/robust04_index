			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Warburg credit rating unchanged SG Warburg has maintained its investment rating in spite of issuing a profit warning earlier this week. Standard &amp; Poors, the US rating agency, has assigned its A+ rating to SGW Finance's Dollars 250m guaranteed floating-rate notes due in 1998. The UK investment bank won the renewed grading even after this week's profits announcement. S&amp;P's judgment allows Warburg to maintain its claim to be the only UK house with a rating to match those of the most strongly capitalised US investment banks.</p>

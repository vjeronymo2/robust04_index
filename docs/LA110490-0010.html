			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> OLDEST HONG KONG EMIGRANT TO LEAVE FOR CANADA;  </P> <P> ASIA: AT 100, AFTER REARING EIGHT CHILDREN AND SURVIVING THE JAPANESE  OCCUPATION, SHE CAN'T FACE A TAKEOVER BY THE CHINESE.  </P> <P> Maria Venus Rozario has faced hunger and Japanese invaders during 100 years in  Hong Kong. After her husband died when she was 33, she hacked a living for  their eight children from this jungle of free enterprise.  </P> <P> Now, Rozario is leaving, lonely for the children already gone and fearful of  China's Communist government, which takes over the British colony in 1997.  </P> <P> When she steps onto the plane for Vancouver, Canada, the frail but spry  great-grandmother will become the oldest emigrant in a mass exodus from Hong  Kong.  </P> <P> The government says 62,000 of Hong Kong's 5.7 million people will leave this  year, but other estimates put the number closer to 80,000. Most emigrants are  professionals in their 30s and 40s, but growing numbers of old people are  joining them.  </P> <P> Hong Kong's elderly, left behind by their emigrating children, often have the  bitter choice of dying alone or leaving home.  </P> <P> "It's not too much to ask to be with one's family, is it?" Rozario said,  fingering a tattered family photograph. "But I will also miss Hong Kong. My  whole life is here with all my memories."  </P> <P> Rozario, who plans to leave this month, has a daughter in British Columbia and  a son in San Francisco.  </P> <P> Her home in Hong Kong is a small apartment in a run-down tenement in the  teeming Kowloon section.  </P> <P> Downstairs are the Steamy Steam Baths and the Chinese Happy Tattoo House.  Upstairs, in Rozario's apartment, are fresh flowers and a small collection of  butterflies.  </P> <P> Maria Venus Gomes da Silva was born into a family of sailors from the  Portuguese colony of Macao, 45 miles south of Hong Kong on the southern Chinese  coast.  </P> <P> Her father moved to Hong Kong, where he married and started a family. Maria  went to work at 14, teaching English grammar to the daughters of British  soldiers stationed in the territory.  </P> <P> She left the school in 1913 to marry a Portuguese businessman, and her first  child was born in 1915.  </P> <P> His death of a heart attack in 1923 left Rozario alone with eight children. She  never remarried and supported the children by working two jobs at once,  sometimes three, as secretary, clerk and accountant.  </P> <P> "You don't know how hard hunger is to take, especially when it's your children  who are hungry," she said.  </P> <P> Then came Japan's brutal occupation during World War II.  </P> <P> One day, Japanese troops lined up a group of young men on a boulevard by Hong  Kong's harbor. A Japanese policeman moved along the rank, chopping off their  heads with a sword.  </P> <P> One of Rozario's sons, Marcos, was last in line. He had been arrested for  resisting the occupation.  </P> <P> "I ran through the crowd and pleaded with the man to save my boy," she said.  "He gave in."  </P> <P> At the end of the war, Rozario collected Marcos from jail. He was tortured and  broken by the Japanese and still lives with his mother, unable to work.  </P> <P> Rozario said she hopes to take Marcos to Canada, "but if we cannot get the  visa, then he will stay here. This is what has become of my family."  </P> <P> After the war, her other children left Hong Kong one by one, attracted by  better job prospects or propelled by fear of the Communists in China.  </P> <P> "The family all wanted to stay," she said, "but it was the insecurity about  Hong Kong that made them leave. How can we live in peace here with the Chinese  ready to grab us back?"  </P> <P> Soon after China's bloody crackdown on the pro-democracy movement in Beijing  last year, Rozario also decided to go.  </P> <P> "Just like in the Bible, it's really an exodus," she said. "I'm just a little  drop of water in all this."  </P></p>

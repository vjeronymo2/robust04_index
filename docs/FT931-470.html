			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / People: British Steel: Frame steps down Brian Moffat's way to the top of British Steel has been cleared more swiftly than he could have hoped - twice over. Appointed chief executive in July 1991 after the unexpected resignation of Martin Llowarch, he now assumes the chairmanship as well because Sir Alistair Frame is resigning at the end of April. Sir Alistair, who has held the position for just nine months and turns 64 in April, is listening to medical advice to reduce his business commitments. At Wellcome, where he has been chairman since 1990, chief executive John Robb says the company was 'actively considering the succession to the chairmanship' adding that it had been planned 'for some time past' that Sir Alistair would retire within the next year or so. His departure is a blow to British Steel, which has long been criticised for its inbred management structure. By contrast, the arrival of Sir Alistair, former RTZ chairman, to replace Sir Bob Scholey, then executive chairman, had initially been greeted as a suitable injection of new blood. Last November, the company declared a pre-tax loss of Pounds 51m for the half year to October 3, and omitted its interim dividend. But Sir Alistair had yet to make any impact, probably because of his brief sojourn. The company's answer to the so-called Cadbury code, which favours splitting the roles of chairman and chief executive, is to elevate non-executive director Sir Nicholas Goodison to deputy chairman, alongside Sir Ronald Halstead. Sir Nicholas, member of the British Steel board since 1989 and a prominent spokesman in the corporate governance debate, will be 'formally responsible' for implementing the code's requirements. Having missed the opportunity to find another outsider to be non-executive chairman, it now seems likely that the next search will in due course be for a chief executive. John McDowall and Tony Pedder, only on the board since last May, are thought likely to be candidates eventually. A chartered accountant by training, 54-year-old Moffat (left) has been at British Steel for 25 years, serving as finance director between 1986 and 1991.</p>

Chiao made the remarks while meeting with Wang Zhaoguo,  director of Beijing State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office, at  the Great Hall of the People.    "We have to sew the cloth together slowly and patiently so  as  to make it flawless," Chiao said.    He said that mutual trust between the two sides could not be  established overnight.    He said that people in Taiwan are paying great attention to  his talks with Tang Shubei, his counterpart from the Association  for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) because they see  the meeting as a "touchstone" in the development of the  cross-strait relations.    Wang said that Chiao's trip to Beijing is conducive to the  further acceleration of Taiwan-Mainland ties.    He expressed the hope that a second round of talks between  SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu and ARATS President Wang Daohan would  take place soon. The first, historic meeting was in Singapore  in April.    Chiao's negotiations with Tang continue tomorrow after  ending  in a stalemate again Thursday.</p>

			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / International Company News: Thrifts in plan for Dollars 1.1bn merger The two largest thrifts in the New York/New Jersey metropolitan region - Dime Bancorp and Anchor Bancorp - yesterday announced plans for a Dollars 1.1bn stock-swap merger, the biggest move yet in the consolidation of the New York area thrift business. The merger will form the fourth-largest publicly traded thrift in the US, with total assets of about Dollars 20bn and deposits of nearly Dollars 13bn. Investors in Anchor will receive 1.77 shares of Dime stock for each of their shares, valuing Anchor at around Dollars 1bn on the basis of yesterday's Dime share price, which dipped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 9 1/4 . Anchor fell  7/16 to Dollars 15 1/2 . The US thrift industry - which has traditionally obtained most of its deposits from consumer savings and supplied loans to the residential mortgage market - is facing growing competition for loan business. Dime, with headquarters in New York City, had Dollars 5.9bn in deposits and Dollars 9.4bn in assets at the end of the first quarter and operates 34 full service branches in the metropolis. Anchor, which has its headquarters in Nassau County, on Long Island, had Dollars 6.9bn in deposits and Dollars 10.3bn in assets at the end of March. It operates 51 full service branches in New York, New Jersey and Florida. Both thrifts have recovered from losses in the property downturn of the late 1980s and early 1990s and the merged entity is expected to be classified as 'well capitalised' under regulatory guidelines. Mr Richard Parsons, chairman and chief executive of Dime Bancorp, will have the same roles at the new holding company, while Mr James Large, chairman and chief executive of Anchor, will head Dime Savings Bank.</p>

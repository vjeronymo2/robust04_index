			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / International Company News: Perstorp tumbles 60% to SKr67m PERSTORP, the Swedish speciality chemicals and plastics group, made a profit after financial items of only SKr67m (Dollars 11.4m) in the last quarter of 1991, a drop of 60 per cent from the SKr166m for the same months in 1990, writes Robert Taylor. Group sales were up 5 per cent, to SKr2.38bn from SKr2.26bn in the September-December period of 1990. This, however, was mainly due to acquisitions.</p>

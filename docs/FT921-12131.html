			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / UK Company News: BICC sells networking business BICC Group, the international cables and construction group, is selling its data networking business to 3Com, the US-based global data networking company, for Dollars 25m (Pounds 13.8m) and 500,000 shares of 3Com common stock. The sale reflects moves by BICC to move out of peripheral businesses and focus more closely on its core cable and construction operations. For 3Com the attraction of the acquisition is that it gives the US company a leading market position in four of the key products in data networking. The acquisition also immediately provides it with a strong presence in the European market. BICC's networking business will also benefit. Although it had sales last year of Dollars 75m and was profitable, it did not have the critical mass needed to gain international competitiveness, said Ms Janice Roberts, currently president of BICC's networking business in the US.</p>

Introduction <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In a notice published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of August 11, 1992 (57 FR 35833), FDA announced that a color additive petition (CAP 6C0204) had been filed by CTFA, 1101 17th St. NW., suite 300, Washington, DC 20036. The petition proposed that the color additive regulations for D&amp;C Green No. 5 be amended to provide for the safe use of D&amp;C Green No. 5 for coloring drugs and cosmetics intended for use in the area of the eye. The petition was filed under section 706 (currently section 721) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 376) (currently 21 U.S.C. 379e). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Regulatory History <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulatory history of D&amp;C Green No. 5 is summarized in a final rule that was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of June 4, 1982 (47 FR 24278). In that final rule, FDA permanently listed D&amp;C Green No. 5 for use in drugs and cosmetics excluding use in the area of the eye. These actions were taken in response to a color additive petition (CAP 8C0084). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Definitions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 70.3(s) (21 CFR 70.3(s)) defines the term ``area of the eye'' as ``the area enclosed within the circumference of the supra-orbital ridge and the infra-orbital ridge, including the eyebrow, the skin below the eyebrow, the eyelids and the eyelashes, and conjunctival sac of the eye, the eyeball, and the soft areolar tissue that lies within the perimeter of the infra-orbital ridge.'' 21 CFR 70.5(a) states that ``No listing or certification of a color additive shall be considered to authorize the use of any such color additive in any article intended for use in the area of the eye unless such listing or certification of such color additive specifically provides for such use.'' The petitioner has requested that the uses for D&amp;C Green No. 5 be expanded to include drug and cosmetic uses in the area of the eye. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. The Color Additive <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> D&amp;C Green No. 5 is principally the disodium salt of 2,2'-[(9,10-dihydro-9,10-dioxo-1,4-anthracenediyl)diimino]bis-[5-methylbenzenesulfonic acid] (CAS Reg. No. 4403&hyph;90&hyph;1). The manufacture of D&amp;C Green No. 5 is accomplished by the sulfonation of D&amp;C Green No. 6 with fuming sulfuric acid. Because D&amp;C Green No. 6 is the starting material in this manufacturing process, the possibility exists that the chemicals used in the synthesis of D&amp;C Green No. 6 may be present in minor amounts in D&amp;C Green No. 5. D&amp;C Green No. 6 is formed by chemically reacting one molecule of quinizarin with two molecules of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> p <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -toluidine. The significance of these components is that Weisburger et al. have demonstrated that  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> p <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -toluidine is a carcinogen in mice (Ref. 1). Residual amounts of reactants, such as  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> p <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -toluidine and related manufacturing aids, are commonly found among the constituents of many color additives. The presence of such constituents, however, is not unique to color additives. Numerous contaminants are unavoidably present in all chemical products, even in highly purified reagent grade chemicals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although D&amp;C Green No. 5 has itself not been shown to cause cancer, it does contain minor amounts of a carcinogenic impurity,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> p <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -toluidine. The carcinogenicity of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> p <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -toluidine was discussed in the final rule, published in the of <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->  Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  June 4, 1982 (47 FR 24278), permanently listing D&amp;C Green No. 5 for use in drugs and cosmetics, excluding use in the area of the eye.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Determination of Safety <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 721(b)(4) of the act (21 U.S.C. 379e(b)(4)), the so-called ``general safety clause'' for color additives, a color additive cannot be listed for a particular use unless a fair evaluation of the data available to FDA establishes that the color additive is safe for that use. FDA's color additive regulations (&sect;70.3(i)) define safe as ``convincing evidence that establishes with a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from the intended use of the color additive.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The anticancer or Delaney clause of the Color Additive Amendments (section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 721(b)(5)(B) of the act) provides that a noningested color additive shall be deemed unsafe and shall not be listed if, after tests that are appropriate for evaluating the safety of the additive for such use, it is found to induce cancer in man or animal. Importantly, however, the Delaney clause applies to the additive itself and not to constituents of the additive. That is, where an additive itself has not been shown to cause cancer, but contains a carcinogenic impurity, the additive is properly evaluated under the general safety clause using risk assessment procedures to determine whether there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from the proposed use of the additive ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Scott <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FDA <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 728 F.2d 322 (6th Cir. 1984)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Safety of the Petitioned Use of the Additive <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA estimates from the data submitted and other relevant information that the exposure to D&amp;C Green No. 5 from its use in drugs and cosmetics intended for use in the area of the eye, is 0.56 milligrams per person per day (mg/p/d), based upon a maximum frequency of application and maximum quantity applied. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA does not ordinarily consider chronic toxicological testing to be necessary to determine the safety of an additive whose use will result in such low exposure levels (Ref. 2), and the agency has not required such testing here. Although the agency does not normally require such testing, chronic studies supporting current listings for the use of D&amp;C Green No. 5 are available in the agency's files, and FDA's safety evaluation for the proposed use of the color additive in drugs and cosmetics intended for use in the area of the eye included a consideration of these studies. Two-year carcinogenicity studies of D&amp;C Green No. 5 showed no indication of carcinogenicity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA has evaluated the safety of this additive under the general safety clause, considering all available data. The agency has used risk assessment procedures to estimate the upper-bound limit of risk presented by  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> p <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -toluidine, the carcinogenic chemical that may be present as an impurity in the additive. The risk evaluation of this chemical has two aspects: (1) Assessment of the exposure to the impurity from the proposed use of the additive, and (2) extrapolation of the risk observed in the animal bioassays to the conditions of probable exposure to humans. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA estimates that the maximum total lifetime exposure to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> p <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -toluidine that will result from the use of D&amp;C Green No. 5 in drugs and cosmetics intended for use in the area of the eye that complies with the applicable specifications is 8.4 nanograms (ng)/p/d. This exposure estimate was based on the use of this color additive in eyebrow pencil, eyeliner, eye shadow, eye lotion, eye makeup remover, mascara, eye cream, eye shadow base, and eye stick. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency used data reported by the National Cancer Institute which demonstrated that  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> p <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -toluidine was carcinogenic for male and female Charles River CD&hyph;1 (HaM/ICR derived) mice, causing an increased incidence of hepatomas (liver tumors) (Ref. 1) to estimate the upper-bound limit of lifetime human risk from exposure to this chemical stemming from the proposed use of D&amp;C Green No. 5 as a color additive in drugs and cosmetics intended for use in the area of the eye (Ref. 3). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on a potential exposure of 8.4 ng/p/d, FDA estimates that the upper-bound limits of individual lifetime risk from the potential exposure to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> p <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -toluidine from the proposed use of D&amp;C Green No. 5 as a color additive in eye area drugs and cosmetics is 2 x 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> -9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or 2 in 1 billion (Ref. 4). Moreover, FDA points out that in an earlier determination of the risk from exposure to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> p <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -toluidine from all other uses of D&amp;C Green No. 5, the agency calculated the upper-bound limits of individual lifetime risk to be in the 1 in 30 million to 1 in 300 million range (47 FR 24278). Thus, the use of D&amp;C Green No. 5 in eye area drugs and cosmetics does not increase this risk in any way. The agency also points out that because of the numerous conservative assumptions used in calculating the exposure estimate, actual lifetime-averaged individual exposure to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> p <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -toluidine is expected to be substantially less than the worst-case exposure. Therefore, the actual upper-bound limits of risk would be less than that cited above. Thus, the agency concludes that there is a reasonable certainty of no harm from exposure to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> p <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -toluidine that might result from the proposed use of D&amp;C Green No. 5 for coloring drugs and cosmetics intended for use in the area of the eye.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In its evaluation of the safety of the proposed use of the subject additive, FDA has also considered other safety data submitted previously to support current listings for the use of D&amp;C Green No. 5. These toxicity studies of D&amp;C Green No. 5, involving dogs, rats, and mice, included acute oral toxicity studies, subchronic studies, and chronic toxicity studies in which animals were exposed to the color additive through diet and skin applications, and reproductive toxicity studies. These studies did not produce any evidence that D&amp;C Green No. 5 would be unsafe for the petitioned uses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, FDA evaluated the ocular toxicity studies that the petitioner provided to support the proposed use of D&amp;C Green No. 5 in drugs and cosmetics intended for use in the area of the eye. Almost all of the animals were free of signs of ocular irritation. The effects noted in most animals that exhibited irritation were slight conjunctival redness or discharge. These irritations were seen sporadically in both control and test animals. Based on its review of these studies, FDA finds that there were no significant adverse clinical findings in the ocular irritation studies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VII. Conclusions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Safety <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based upon the available toxicity data and other relevant considerations discussed above, FDA concludes that there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from the use of D&amp;C Green No. 5 as a color additive in drugs and cosmetics intended for use in the area of the eye. The agency also concludes on the basis of available data that the color additive will perform its intended technical effect and thus is suitable for the petitioned uses. The agency, therefore, is amending &sect;&sect;74.1205(c)(2) and 74.2205(b) of the color additive regulations to provide for the use of D&amp;C Green No. 5 in drugs and cosmetics intended for use in the area of the eye.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Specifications <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> D&amp;C Green No. 5 is currently produced as a certifiable color additive for use in drugs and cosmetics excluding use in the area of the eye in amounts consistent with current good manufacturing practices in accordance with 21 CFR part 80. Based upon the low level of exposure to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> p <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -toluidine that results under the current specifications for D&amp;C Green No. 5 in &sect;&sect;74.1205 and 74.2205 (21 CFR 74.1205 and 74.2205), the agency concludes that the specifications listed in &sect;74.1205 are adequate to ensure the safe use of this color additive and to control the amount of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> p <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -toluidine that may exist as an impurity in the color additive when used in drugs and cosmetics intended for use in the area of the eye. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VIII.

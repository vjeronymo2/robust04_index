			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Polish MPs in upset vote on economic plans THE FUTURE of Poland's centre-right government led by Mr Jan Olszewski was put in question yesterday when it lost a key economic policy vote in the country's politically fragmented parliament. The two-month-old government saw its policy document setting out the guidelines for the budget rejected by 171-138 when a coalition of free market liberals, former communists and the populist KPN party combined to vote against it. The guidelines sought to combine a commitment to financial stringency with the promise of combating Poland's recession and thus drew fire from both the monetarist wing in parliament and its opponents. The vote came as the International Monetary Fund is anxiously looking to the government to stick to its promise enshrined in the document to keep this year's budget deficit to within 5 per cent of gross domestic product. Mr Andrzej Olechowski, the finance minister, is due in Washington on March 16 for talks on the government's economic plans. President Lech Walesa, meanwhile, demonstrated yesterday that he is able to command a majority in parliament, where nine main parties jockey for influence. He won a comfortable majority for Ms Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz, his candidate to head the National Bank of Poland, the central bank. The post has been vacant since last summer when a banking scandal forced the previous incumbent to resign. The vote reversed a decision last December when parliament rejected Ms Gronkiewicz Waltz on the grounds that the 39-year-old academic specialising in banking law had insufficient experience for the job. Yesterday's vote showed, however, that parliament had lost the stomach for a long drawn-out confrontation with the president, who insisted that Ms Gronkiewicz be accepted. At the same time parliament's challenge to Mr Olszewski, the prime minister, does not oblige the government to resign. But it may require a cabinet reshuffle to broaden support for the budget vote to pass. However, it does leave the finance minister without a clear basis on which to construct the budget, which is to be ready by March 23. The vote also shows that the government will be hard pressed to secure a majority in the budget debate a month later, unless he reshuffles his cabinet and broadens his support in parliament. Should Mr Olszewski's cabinet fall over the budget the political initiative would pass to President Walesa who could propose a non-party cabinet and seek to impose it on a divided parliament.</p>

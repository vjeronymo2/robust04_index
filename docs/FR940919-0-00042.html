			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On May 10, 1993, POP petitioned the Agency for an amendment to its 1992 final exclusion for an increase of its annual maximum waste generation from 300 cubic yards to 1,000 cubic yards. After its evaluation of POP's request and supporting information, EPA proposed, on April 11, 1994, to amend POP's December 7, 1992 exclusion to reflect a waste volume increase (see 59 FR 17080).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's rulemaking finalizes the proposed amendment to amend POP's existing exclusion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Disposition of Petition for Amendment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> POP Fasteners, Shelton, Connecticut.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Proposed Amendment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As a result of its business growth, POP petitioned the Agency on May 10, 1993 for an amendment to its 1992 final exclusion for an increase of its annual maximum waste generation from 300 cubic yards to 1,000 cubic yards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> POP stated in an April 19, 1993 letter that: (1) the increase in the filter cake generation was attributable to an increase in rivet production since the petition was filed; (2) there have been no changes in the manufacturing process, feed materials, or waste water treatment process; and (3) the hours of POP's operation have increased.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To confirm that the waste characteristics have not changed, POP submitted results from the analyses of one filter cake composite for all Toxicity Characteristic (TC) constituents listed in 40 CFR 261.24 and nickel using the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP, SW&hyph;846 Method 1311). POP also submitted a signed certification dated May 10, 1993 stating that all submitted information is true, accurate, and complete.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency reviewed its previous decision to grant POP's original delisting petition (57 FR 37921, 57 FR 57673 and the administrative record in the RCRA public docket) and the analytical results provided by POP in support of its request for an amendment to its existing exclusion. The analytical results submitted to support this amendment show that the constituents detected in the waste sample, as well as their respective leachate concentration levels, are consistent with the waste data in POP's original petition. Furthermore, POP has certified that there have been no changes in process or feed materials. Therefore, the Agency believes that the waste characteristics have not changed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency evaluated the potential impact of POP's petitioned waste on human health and the environment, at the increased annual maximum waste volume, following the same approach it used in evaluating POP's original petition. Specifically, the Agency evaluated the waste using the requested annual maximum waste volume estimate of 1,000 cubic yards and the maximum reported leachate concentration of POP's waste using the same ground-water model described in the Agency's original decision (see 57 FR 37921, August 21, 1992 and the RCRA public docket ``F&hyph;92&hyph;PEEP&hyph;FFFFF'' to that rule). The Agency notes that the modeling results are the same for 300 and 1,000 cubic yards, and the increased waste volume has no significant impact. Thus, the Agency believes that the constituents in POP's waste would not leach and migrate at concentrations above the Agency's health-based levels used in delisting decision-making.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA also considered the impact of the increased waste volume on potential risks posed by other exposure routes (i.e., air emission, surface water). Since the total concentration levels of hazardous constituents of concern in the petitioned waste and the active landfill area remain unchanged, the Agency believes that no significant exposure to contaminants potentially released via air emission and surface runoff from POP's petitioned waste is likely. See 57 FR 37921 (August 21, 1992), 57 FR 57673 (December 7, 1992), and the RCRA public dockets for these notices for a detailed description of the evaluation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Response to Public Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency did not receive any comments on the proposed amendment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Final Agency Decision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons stated in the proposed amendment and in today's notice, the Agency believes that POP's waste is non-hazardous at the maximum generation rate of 1,000 cubic yards per year, and should be excluded from hazardous waste control. The Agency, therefore, is granting the amendment to POP Fastener's exclusion to reflect a waste volume increase for waste generated at its Shelton, Connecticut facility. This amendment only applies to the process covered by POP's original petition, and allows a maximum annual waste volume of 1,000 cubic yards. All other conditions listed in POP's exclusion remain unchanged. Waste generated in excess of 1,000 cubic yards per year or from changed processes must be handled as hazardous until a new exclusion is granted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

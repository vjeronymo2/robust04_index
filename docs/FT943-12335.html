			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Business and the Law: Restrictions on imports lawful - European Court National measures which restrict the sale of foodstuffs, including im-ported foodstuffs, to those products which state on their labels the types of preservatives used were held to be lawful by the European Court of Justice. But national restrictions on the amount of salt that could be used in bread were unlawful in that they were in breach of the EC treaty provisions on the free movement of goods. This preliminary ruling was given in the context of criminal proceedings against a Belgian baker who had sold imported bread from the Netherlands and thereby infringed Belgian law twice: first, because the bread contained a higher percentage of salt than was permitted under the national rules; and, secondly, because the labels on the bread indicated neither the exact specification nor the EC number of the preservatives used, but simply stated that the products contained food preservatives. The Court was first asked to rule on whether the Belgian rules on the level of salt that could be used in bread sold in Belgium were contrary to EC treaty provisions on the free movement of goods. The Court first found that there were no relevant EC rules on the amount of salt that could be used in bread and, therefore, national provisions applied. The Belgian law set the limit at 2 per cent, whereas under Dutch law salt levels of up to 2.5 per cent were permitted. The Court found that, although there were no EC harmonising measures, the Belgian rules did restrict imports of Dutch bread (which was lawfully sold in Holland) and, as such, these rules were contrary to the EC treaty provisions on the free movement of goods. The Court then had to determine whether such restrictions could be justified on public health grounds, as claimed by Belgian authorities. On this question, the Court referred to its decision in the German beer case, in which the Court had held that any alleged risk to human health could be determined only on the basis of relevant scientific research. The Belgian authorities, however, did not supply such evidence. They merely said they considered the higher level of salt allowed in the Netherlands 'too high'. Moreover, Belgium could have chosen other means of protecting consumers than the recourse to an outright ban: appropriate labelling would have been less of an impediment to free movement and could have ensured sufficient protection of public health. Consequently, the Court held the Belgian rules could not be justified under the EC treaty. With regard to the description of preservatives on labels, the Court found that EC rules provided that member states could require labels to contain a full description of the preservatives used, but that this was not compulsory. In the present case, the Belgian legislation required a full description of preservatives used, whereas the Dutch legislation did not. The Court was asked whether in such circumstances, the Belgian authorities could lawfully stop bread, which was correctly labelled according to Dutch law, from being imported into Belgium. The Court held first that the Belgian labelling requirements were contrary to the EC treaty provisions on the free movement of goods as they made it more difficult to import the same goods from other member states which did not have the same labelling requirements. The ECJ then went on to say that, since the relevant EC labelling rules did not provide for complete harmonisation, member states were still allowed to invoke the EC treaty provisions or the case law of the Court to seek to try to justify the measures in question. The Court found that for consumers to be properly protected, they had to be in a position to know from a label what a given product contained. Therefore, such labelling requirements as provided for in the Belgian rules served the purpose of consumer protection, which had already been accepted by the Court to be a mandatory requirement justifying restrictions on the free movement of goods. The Court also found the Belgian rules were proportionate in that they interfered much less with the free movement of goods than other measures.

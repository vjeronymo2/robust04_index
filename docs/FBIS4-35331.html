			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unscheduled announcement] </F>   [Text] A warning: He who has warned is not to be blamed.  He who has warned is not to be blamed. He who has warned is  not to be blamed. [repeated three times as heard] After today,  after these moments, after we have drawn the attention of  others, after we have warned, after we have advised, after  today, after this moment, we say it in regret: He who has  warned is not to be blamed. He who has warned is not to be  blamed. [repeated twice as heard] After today, after these  moments, after all our appeals, demands, and warnings, he who  has warned is not to be blamed. We say this to the sergeant and  to those who have been standing by his side until this day, and  until this moment: Everything, as declared by our president,  the president of the Democratic Republic of Yemen, the militant  and patient patriot, 'Ali Salim al-Bid, everything until today  is [word indistinct] since we have drawn the attention of  others, since we have demanded, and since we have warned -- we  are compelled, regrettably, to declare the beginning of the real  war. As far as we are concerned it is the same to us, the war  has begun, the real war will begin. After today we shall  exterminate anyone who is arrogant. We shall destroy anyone who  still dreams about the south. God be our witness. He who has  warned is not to be blamed.</p>

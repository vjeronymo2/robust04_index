			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sakigake Secretary General Hiroyuki Sonoda </F> by TOKYO SHIMBUN correspndents Koichi Obata and Uichiro Oshima;  place and date not given]    [Text] [TOKYO SHIMBUN] How do you view the rapid approach  to each other by Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Japan New  Party [JNP], which are aiming to form a major parliamentary  group and a new political party?    [Sonoda] Their rapid approach is related to a realignment of  political parties. It is a move to defeat the opposition  Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] in the next election. The LDP  remains a powerful political force. Our party understands and  agrees with their intentions to defeat the LDP in the next  election. If the two parties are to form a major parliamentary  group only for the purpose of cooperating with each other in the  next election and in running the Diet, our party cannot go along  with them.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Then, are you against forming a new  political  party?    [Sonoda] If attempts are made to realign political parties  to  create a new party to counter the LDP with differing political  beliefs, policies, and political tactics being left  uncoordinated, this would merely be done to attain a majority.  The plan for a major parliamentary group smacks of a new  political party.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Your party has maintained an engagement-type  relationship with the Japan New Party. How will your party  proceed with its dialogue with that party?    [Sonoda] If the two parties are to form a major  parliamentary  group to cooperate with each other in the next election and in  running the Diet after merging themselves into one party, our  party is willing to discuss various matters with the JNP.  However, the formation of a major parliamentary group is  different from the creation of a party.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Will the engagement between your party and  the JNP be broken off?    [Sonoda] Prime Minister Hosokawa and the JNP have said that  the engagement will not be broken off. It is true that the  prime minister is wary of the JNP. Both Sakigake [Harbinger]  and the JNP have agreed to merge into one party to contest the  next election and to practice politics to enact reforms. My  understanding is that the time has come for the two parties to  merge into one party.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] The prime minister, however, shows no  intention of calling for a shift from an "engagement" to a  "marriage."    [Sonoda] I do not know about that.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] The relationship between the prime minister  and Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura has worsened. Would you  comment on this?    [Sonoda] Although you may not believe me, their relationship  is nearly back to normal. While the prime minister is a  single-minded man, Mr. Takemura is an obedient man who does his  best if asked to by the prime minister. It once was the case  that they rarely met at the Prime Minister's Official Residence  for discussions, but I assume that such a situation no longer is  the case.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Shinseito appears to want to forge an  alliance with Sakigake or the LDP. What do you think?    [Sonoda] If Shinseito is suspected of making contacts as a  party with the LDP, this is incorrect and a misunderstanding.  There have been only personal contacts.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] A prerequisite for a realignment of the  political parties is that not only the ruling coalition parties  but also the LDP and the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]  must change themselves.    [Sonoda] If there is no such prerequisite, it would be  impossible to realign the political parties. It is also  impossible to form a genuinely new political group only months  after the LDP-SDPJ system, which existed for a long time, has  been torn down.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Would you explain Sakigake's strategy for a  realignment of the political parties?    [Sonoda] Power games within the ruling coalition parties are  inevitable. There are some people in the LDP and the SDPJ who  can move toward realigning the political parties. Under present  circumstances, however, they cannot make such moves. Although  it is desirable to realign the political parties, the ruling  coalition parties have to implement policies every day and to  attach more importance to holding their coalition together than  to realigning the political parties.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN] Will a realignment of the political parties  definitely take place?    [Sonoda] Now that a single-seat constituency system has been  adopted for the House of Representatives, in the end, the  current political parties will be merged into two political  forces. Therefore, our party is conscious of the realignment,  but it believes that now is not the time for a realignment.</p>

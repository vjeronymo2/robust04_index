			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Generators near total sell-off: A look at government plans to raise Pounds 4bn from its stakes The government is planning to take the first public steps next month towards selling shares in National Power and PowerGen, the privatised generators in which it still holds 40 per cent stakes, ahead of a disposal in February or March. It is preparing to provide details of the process to up to 150 banks, brokers, building societies and financial advisers. An announcement on the sale, expected to raise more than Pounds 4bn, is expected towards the end of September. The government is planning to sell all its remaining shares. It sold off 60 per cent of each company in their privatisations three years ago. The government expects to start marketing the sale in mid-January with a prospectus following about a month to six weeks later. Shares would be issued either at the end of February or early March. The sale will be the last of the multi-billion pound disposals of state holdings. The government's sale of British Coal, British Rail and 51 per cent of the Post Office would raise considerably less. At yesterday's closing prices, the government's 40 per cent stakes in National Power and PowerGen were worth Pounds 4.4bn. That compares with the government's target of raising Pounds 5.5bn through privatisation this financial year. The Treasury has indicated it expects to receive Pounds 3.7bn from other sources, including the sale of government debt and BT shares, by the end of October. This means the government will need less than Pounds 2bn this financial year from the generator sales. It is likely that payment for the shares in the two companies will be in instalments, with some proceeds flowing in next year or later. Ministers have yet to decide whether payments should be made in two or three instalments. As in the March 1991 flotation, when 60 per cent of the shares were sold, buyers will be required to buy shares in both companies. Existing shareholders are expected to be offered preferential treatment, as were BT shareholders in the sale of the second and third tranches of its shares. For this reason the marketing is expected within the electricity industry to be aimed at a more sophisticated audience than the original flotation. 'It will be more for the Sidney than the Sid,' said one power company executive yesterday. The advertising for the disposal is being handled by WCRS. The government is being advised by Barclays de Zoete Wedd and Kleinwort Benson on the financial aspects of the sale, and by Dewe Rogerson, the public relations and marketing company. Next month's announcement on timing and details is aimed at giving the broking and banking 'share shops' maximum opportunity to prepare for the flotation. The February/March sale is likely to be followed within a few months by the flotation of the National Grid, expected to be valued at more than Pounds 4bn. However, this will not necessarily involve its owners, the regional electricity companies, selling shares and so may not amount to another cash-call on investors. One option is that shareholders in the regional companies will be given shares in the Grid.</p>

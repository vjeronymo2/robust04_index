			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Bratislava NARODNA OBRODA in Slovak on  25 January on page 11 carries a 1,200-word interview with  Vladimir Stefko, director of Slovak Radio, by Valeria Koszoruova  entitled "Disobedient Radio?" In the interview, the place and  date of which are not given, Stefko blames the government's  interference in Slovak Radio's commercial activities for the  institution's difficult economic situation.    In his initial reply, Stefko discusses Slovak Radio's past  efforts to reduce its dependence on the state budget by  developing its own commercial activities. In this context, he  says: "In 1992, for example, Slovak Radio's economic result was  41.5 million korunas better than projected. Last year, the  situation changed dramatically for the worse, owing mainly to  state interference. The state reduced the majority of Slovak  Radio's commercial activities. At the same time, it halted the  state subsidy, in contravention of National Council of the  Slovak Republic Law Number 14. This was done by the same bodies  that in December 1991 called on Slovak Radio to step up its  commercial activities in order to ease the burden on the state  budget and that promised us the retention of the improved  economic result (that is, 41.5 million korunas) to cover parts  of the budget that the state was unable to fund. Slovak Radio  was deprived of about 80 million korunas in this way, and, in  1993, for the first time in its history, it ended the year with  debts. The bulk of them are owed to Slovak Telecommunications,  of which Slovak Radio is one of the main customers."    Whereas, in the past, Slovak Radio had three different  sources of revenue, Stefko says--subscription fees, state  subsidies, and income from commercial activities--now it must  make do with subscription fees, which are constantly declining.  In this context, he notes that, even though there are 1.9  million households with at least one radio set in Slovakia,  according to official statistics, Slovak Radio receives fees  from only 1,000,016 subscribers. Stefko attributes the decline  to the deteriorating social situation of households and to  loopholes in the legislation, which do not make it possible to  track down and fine nonpayers.    Citing a specific example of "interference" in Slovak  Radio's  commercial activities, Stefko mentions the decision of the  Ministry of Transportation and Communications to ban broadcasts  by the Austrian-owned Radio CD International from Slovak  territory. According to Stefko, the cooperation agreement with  the Austrian partner guaranteed Slovak Radio an annual income of  52 million Slovak korunas. He points out that "depriving Slovak  Radio of money" was the sole aim of this ban, which, he says,  "also met with a very negative response on the Austrian  political scene."    Further on, Stefko explains the "austerity measures" being  applied by Slovak Radio as of 17 January, in connection with the  introduction of a new programming structure, which include a  reduction in the number of radio stations to three. In spite of  these austerity measures, Stefko says, Slovak Radio's costs will  exceed its revenues by 84 million korunas this year. He warns  that the "intervention against the radio undermines the  foundations of Slovak culture" because cultural and educational  programs are affected most severely of all. He mentions, for  example, that Slovak Radio may be forced to give up its  orchestra, which costs 18 million korunas a year and earns only  about 5 million korunas.    Stefko also points to Slovak Radio's ambivalent legal  status,  which makes it possible for the government to treat it the way  it does. He says: "Law number 255 states that Slovak Radio is  managed as a subsidized organization. At the same time,  according to the same law, it can be entered in the company  register and has the right to engage in entrepreneurial  activity. Hence, we are controlled like a subsidized  organization, but, on the other hand, we are not being provided  with financial resources like a subsidized organization.  Everybody uses this [ambivalence] the way it suits him."</p>

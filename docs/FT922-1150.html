			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / European Finance and Investment, Spain (9): Companies get to grips with risk - Rating agencies IF INTERNATIONAL rating agencies had not recently opened up for business in Spain, conglomerates such as the Instituto Nacional de Industria (INI) would have had to invent them. At the begining of this month, INI, the owner of most of Spain's public sector companies, was awarded an AA long-term rating and an A1+ for commercial paper by IBCA, the London-based institution. The awards anticipated the forthcoming dissection of INI into two units: one for the group's loss-making companies in sectors such as coal mining and intergrated steel, and a second for those that make money. IBCA's judgment on INI also coincided with the conglomerate's need to go to the markets, because the government has issued stern warnings about the unavailability of capital injections from the state budget. The ratings, which indicated a very reduced investor risk, were thus a shot in the arm for INI's financial strategists as they began to plan presentations for institutional investors. Mr Salvador Garcia-Atance, the chairman of Madrid brokers Asesores Bursatiles and a senior figure in Spain's financial sector, had long identified the need for ratings agencies. 'It was quite clear that we had to have them,' he says. Specialist institutions to evaluate risk were the logical consequence of the deregulation of the domestic stock exchanges. Rating agencies are, in particular, fundamental to the growth of the underdeveloped domestic secondary market. The volume of commercial paper and bonds in Spain amounted to Pta2,000bn in 1991, but only 26 companies availed themselves of these instruments, with just 11 of them accounting for 74 per cent of the total sum. In the event, Mr Garcia-Atance negotiated the entry into Spain of the US agency Standard and Poor's. The Spanish subsidiary of the US firm was formally constituted in March, as a joint venture with Spanish partners that included the Madrid, Bilbao and Valencia stock exchanges, and it will be fully operational in September. IBCA, which is in the process of expanding in Europe, opened its Spanish subsiduary in January with the Barcelona stock exchange as a junior partner. Mr Charles Prescott, chairman of IBCA Espana, sees a profitable future for the venture: 'The people we are speaking to say that, in a few years, everybody is going to need a rating.' Initial business (IBCA has awarded a rating to Repsol, the state-controled energy, gas and chemical holding in addition to INI) is nevertheless slow, and Mr Prescott says he would be delighted if a total of 10 corporate ratings were awarded in the course of the year. Persistent persuasion is going to be required to help medium and smaller Spanish companies overcome the reluctance with which they receive risk evaluators. 'Everyone wants to have a Triple-A, and we have to convince them there is nothing wrong with being an A. Our first job is to help companies understand what a rating is,' says Mr Prescott. In its bid to develop this new market, IBCA Espana has created a promotional board that brings together institutions such as Inverco, an association grouping domestic funds, which represent the end-users of a rating. It is these funds - and they are growing strongly - which will in time determine the consolidation of the ratings business in Spain. What is likely to occur is that the Spanish funds will introduce internal rules requiring a rating for investment in long-term paper. This practice, which already operates outside Spain, effectively regulates the risk. Mr Garcia-Atance believes that the National Stock Exchange Commission will eventually impose some form of risk regulation on the funds if they do not themselves voluntarily introduce them.</p>

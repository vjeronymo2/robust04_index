			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Muddling towards democracy: Truth of the Matter - Patti Waldmeir on the problems that face South Africa and Russia OF ALL the nations struggling toward democracy, few seem to have less natural aptitude for the task than Russia and South Africa. Neither is politically tolerant by nature: throughout history, both have proved themselves excellent autocrats, corrupt and terrible tyrants. But now Moscow and Pretoria, bitterest enemies for decades, have become strange comrades in battle: falteringly, they fight the tide of culture and history to pursue a liberal democratic goal which seems to recede as often as it draws nearer. Neither is likely to follow a straight path to democracy - if indeed, they ever get there. But both are committed to ruling by consent and not coercion; and a return to either totalitarianism or apartheid is out of the question. Both must therefore search for a more or less democratic form of government which can hold anarchy at bay while protecting the minimum of civil liberties. So far the move to democracy has fostered chaos, crime and violence in both countries. Many already yearn for a strong man to restore order. In South Africa, a prominent mixed race politician complains (only half in jest) 'I miss apartheid'; and most Russians would probably understand this nostalgia for authoritarian certainty. But in the longer term, a betting man would probably conclude that Russia will stay the course to full democracy - however circuitous - and that South Africa will not. Both face formidable obstacles to democratisation, chief among them problems of ethnicity and economic hardship. But South Africa has a further overwhelming disadvantage: the rigid correlation between wealth and race decreed by apartheid. For democracy is scarcely the obvious solution for a country where the majority is poor, black and impatient and the minority white, rich and powerful: democracy invites the individual to use his vote to obtain a fairer share of wealth; but any government which indulges the urge to redistribute wealth will alienate white skills and capital, and jeopardise economic growth. Either way, the incumbent government would suffer at the ballot box - and would probably soon decide to dispense with democratic elections. As Alexis de Tocqueville pointed out more than 150 years ago: 'When the people rule, they must be rendered happy or they will overturn the state.' But in South Africa, the 'state' would not give up without a fight; a new government may well be tempted to impose its will - in the national interest, of course - rather than hand over to the opposition. Not surprisingly, most South Africans reject this scenario: indeed, they find cheer in the midst of political upheaval by counting their considerable blessings in comparison with Russia. South African democrats will inherit intact the one most necessary condition for democracy: a market economy. That economy may have been damaged by 40 years of 'Afrikaner socialism', which used state capital to set up nationalised industries dominated by the 'white tribe of Africa'. But repairing its flaws is a small task compared with that facing Russia's economic reformers. From nothing, they must create financial markets, draw up a detailed body of company law and construct all the institutional supports necessary to capitalism. South Africa inherits these things from the apartheid state; and before the African National Congress decides to tamper with this inheritance, it should reflect on the ways in which capitalism underpins the democratic system which the ANC professes as its goal. In developed democracies, the private sector functions as an important check on the power of governmental authority; and the market economy holds out the best hope of a prosperity which is essential to bolster democracy from below. Paradoxically, South Africans will also inherit from apartheid - a most undemocratic ideology - the infrastructure of a thriving political democracy which Russia struggles so painfully to build. South Africa has political parties, independent courts, lobby groups and all the paraphernalia of parliamentary democracy, which can surely be adapted for a multi-racial future. But in Russia the Communist Party, which invaded every aspect of personal and public life, has deeply discredited the very notion of 'party'; indeed, there are few coherent party alternatives to President Boris Yeltsin, himself something of a one-man band. Progress towards the establishment of an independent judiciary in Russia is perhaps more advanced: the new Constitutional Court represents a milestone on the path to democracy. But Russia has no tradition of challenging state power through the courts - certainly not under communism, when challenging party decisions was effectively forbidden - and it lacks the institutional depth (the courts, the judges, the independent lawyers) present in South Africa. Even in the worst days of apartheid abuse, South Africa's courts managed to preserve much of their independence. But democracy requires more than political parties, elections and courts: a vigorous civil society (everything from trades unions to churches, women's groups to chambers of commerce) is necessary to frustrate the would-be tyrant. Such civil infrastructure is well developed in both black and white South Africa - and almost non-existent in Russia. Organised business and labour in South Africa could counter-balance government power; civic associations in black townships could prove a further check on central government; and with three-quarters of the population actively religious, the churches will remain a major political force. What is more, South Africa will inherit a state machine which actually works; in Russia, where party and state were practically indivisible, the collapse of the one has destroyed the other. No new South African government is likely to face the crisis of executive power which currently assails Moscow. So that is the triple challenge facing Russia: to create a modern state, a modern market economy and democratic political institutions, and to do so simultaneously under conditions of great economic hardship. But however daunting the immediate crisis, Russia will probably muddle through in the end to democracy and prosperity. And South Africa, whatever its early advantages, may not. Western democracies will continue to provide moral support to Russian democrats (however unreliable their financial backing), while South Africa will rapidly be left to itself on the remote tip of a forgotten continent. And over time, the gross inequalities of South African society could prove too much for a fledgling democracy. Both face problems of ethnicity and economic deprivation which threaten democracy; but in South Africa, crucially, they are linked. While Russians struggle (more or less) equally to survive, race determines the degree of hardship experienced by each South African. As long as that is so palpably true, it is hard to see how democracy can take root. But even if South Africa - perhaps Russia too - reverts temporarily to authoritarian rule, there can be no returning to the specific abominations of the past. Totalitarian communism and apartheid are ruled out forever. The future can scarcely be worse.

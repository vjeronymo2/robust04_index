			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial Office report: "Editorial Saga"] </F>   [Text] PRAVDA has already reported on what has been  happening in and around our newspaper's editorial office of  late. But the high emotions in the newspapers and on television  and radio, fueled by Viktor Linnik and his team, are showing no  signs of abating (in particular, yesterday's issue of NOVAYA  YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA carried a manifestly biased article  entitled "Viktor Linnik Has Yet To Occupy the Editor's Chair").  But the crux of the matter is in general terms simple: In  early February the PRAVDA collective passed a vote of no  confidence in the then Editor Viktor Linnik. It did so because  the newspaper's leader was unable to ensure its regular  publication and because an atmosphere of uncertainty about the  future had been created in the editorial office. But the main  reason was that the editor and his comrades-in-arms were ready  to close the newspaper down for an indefinite period, which  would have caused -- and already was causing -- irreparable  damage to PRAVDA's prestige and would have jeopardized its  continuing existence. However, on 6 April, Linnik was reinstated  in his post by a court ruling -- clearly errors in the  organization of the collective's assembly played their part  here. All right, PRAVDA's workers, as law-abiding people,  agreed to implement the court judgment. But the very first  steps toward reinstating the "chief" caused unrest in the  collective. It turned out that Linnik was still prepared to  close the newspaper down for a long while and he announced that  the paper had split from its publisher, heedless of the damage  that such a step could cause his editorial associates. Orders,  including orders on staffing issues, were signed one after  another, without any consultation at all with the editorial  office, which under the editorial charter has the final say.  The board of the journalists' organization then decided to call  -- strictly in accordance with the editorial charter -- a  combined meeting of the journalists' organization and the  journalists' collective. It considered the question of the  chief editor. Having agreed to implement the court ruling, the  collective deemed it essential to hear Linnik. But the latter  refused to attend the meeting or talks with his comrades.  Linnik was released from the duties of chief editor by an  overwhelming majority of votes (there were only four votes  against). At that same meeting Aleksandr Ilin, a PRAVDA worker  for 20 years, who had run the collective for the previous two  months, was elected chief editor of PRAVDA. During that time 40  issues of the newspaper had ben published and it had developed a  good working rhythm. That is why a decision in favor of Ilin  was made, not because of any fiat from abroad, as certain  "patriots" claim. It only remains to say that PRAVDA's  editorial office is producing a newspaper, and our readers,  judging by their responses, hold it in high esteem. But some  former ambitious colleagues are doing all they can to damage  PRAVDA by distorting the truth of the matter, operating on the  principle that it does not matter if PRAVDA is in a bad way as  long as they are okay. You will agree that a chief editor who  fights for his job against the will of a collective which has  voted him out looks strange. Perhaps it is time for our  colleagues on other publications to realize that by their  articles they are supporting not PRAVDA the newspaper (this  hardly worries them) but a contender for the editorial chair?</p>

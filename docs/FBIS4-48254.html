			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] As the campaign for the formation of a standing  national transitional army for Liberia continues, the leadership  of the NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia], the largest  faction in the conflict, says it is prepared to provide 2,500  men for the standing army. The leader of the NPFL, President  Charles Gankay Taylor, said both ULIMO [United Liberation  Movement for Democracy in Liberia] and the AFL [Armed Forces of  Liberia] could provide 1,500 men each to beef up the  transitional army. He said the three factions in Liberia  already have trained men and only need to get together for  better acquaintance. We can begin providing uniforms and  equipment for our own army, President Taylor continued.    The former NPRAG [National Patriotic Reconstruction Assembly  Government] president said: There is a dire need to form a  transitional army in order to constitutionally safeguard the  territorial integrity and sovereignty of Liberia. He said the  alien military force, ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African  States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group], dominated by Nigerian armed  aggressors, have demonstrated their inability to stop the  Liberian crisis by directly facilitating war.    President Taylor said: It is constitutionally improper for a  government to be in place without a protecting army of its own.  The NPFL leader cited revelations of direct Nigerian-ECOMOG  support for LPC [Liberia Peace Council] bandits in southeastern  Liberia and expressed regret that while there was a cease-fire  in place, the so-called peacekeepers were still waging war on  the people of Liberia. He noted that the mission of the NPFL to  restore democracy, justice, and peace has still not been  accomplished.    The CIC [commander in chief] then commended senior officers  and commanders of the NPFL for their bravery and sacrifices and  repeated the commitment of the NPFL to continue to abide by the  Cotonou Accord, despite its imperfections, as a way of moving  the peace process forward.

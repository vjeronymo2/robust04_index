			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / International Company News: Bertelsmann in New York deal BERTELSMANN, the German-based media and entertainment group, is spending Dollars 119m to purchase a 44-storey office block in the heart of New York's Times Square district. The deal, one of the biggest Manhattan property transactions in recent years, was agreed with a group of lenders including Citibank, the US bank that led the consortium of 17 financial institutions which loaned Dollars 250m to complete the building in 1990. The approval of the banks was needed because the actual owner of the 868,000 sq ft building is Broadway State Partners, a consortium of US and Japanese investors that has filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy law. Mayor David Dinkins yesterday welcomed the purchase and Bertelsmann's decision to make the building the new headquarters of its US operations, including the Bantam Doubleday Dell publishing group and the Bertelsmann Music Group (BMG). The purchase - for less than 50 per cent of the investment made just two years ago - underscores the dire state of the New York commercial real estate market. It is understood that Citibank, which provided nearly 30 per cent of the Dollars 250m initial investment, last year wrote down a significant portion of its loan. Bertelsmann expects to occupy two-thirds of the skyscraper, with 1,700 employees moving to the new headquarters. Remaining space will be available for sub-lease and internal expansion. Mr Peter Olson, president of Bertelsmann Inc, said a benefit package provided by the City of New York was essential in making the transaction. Financial terms of the benefit package were not disclosed. As part of its agreement with the city government, Bertelsmann will market over 100,000 sq ft of space to international companies not yet present in New York. In leasing the excess space, Bertelsmann has agreed to launch a marketing campaign in the US and Europe that will give priority to the international companies. Bertelsmann's New York property investment comes when the German media giant is seeking to expand further its business areas. The company, whose BMG division controls RCA Records as well as Arista Records, recently made an offer to acquire Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Music Group.</p>

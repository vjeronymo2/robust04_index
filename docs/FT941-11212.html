			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Pet owners in the dog-house: The growing calls to banish canines from China's cities Dog-lover Lai Mincheng is not a happy man these days in spite of the approach of the Year of the Dog according to the oriental lunar calendar. With scant regard for sentiment, People's Daily, the Communist party newspaper, has railed against dog-ownership, adding its stern voice to growing calls to rid Chinese cities of man's best friend. Pet dogs should be banished, the paper said, because they 'spread rabies and threaten people's lives . . . urinate and defecate everywhere . . . bark and yelp, scaring people and biting people'. Mr Lai, senior veterinarian at Beijing General Pets Hospital, fears that such prejudices will rebound against efforts by dog-owners to persuade people that theirs is a harmless hobby. 'I hardly have the heart to go to work these days,' he said. Not since the 1950s and 1960s has the party newspaper been quite so unkind about the humble canine. Dogs were banned from most Chinese cities after the Communists took over, determined to build a new and healthy society. During the Cultural Revolution, Mr Lai hid his pet birds under his bed because owning pets was considered bourgeois and decadent. Some of those dark memories have been revived recently with reports of dogs being taken forcibly away from tearful owners. Mr Lai recalls individual acts of resistance with satisfaction. In one case a woman threatened to jump out the window of her high-rise apartment rather than give up her dog. Before the Year of the Rooster gives way to the Year of the Dog next Thursday, uncertainty surrounds the fate of Beijing's pampered pooches. Government curbs, to be known by the bleak title of 'Regulations on Pets: Sanitation Control', are expected to place a limit on the size of dogs - ownership would be restricted to small breeds such as terriers - and would also make parks and public areas off-limits to dogs. The new rules will hit China's emerging, moneyed middle class, which is largely responsible for dog-ownership becoming first a fad and then a craze in cities like Beijing and Shanghai. Canines of dubious parentage have been changing hands for hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of dollars. Russian traders have been a chief source of supply, smuggling puppies past border guards and selling them in Chinese markets, or bartering them for garments or cloth. The main problem with smuggled Russian dogs, as far as the Chinese authorities are concerned, is that apart from the avoidance of quarantine controls, these animals tend to grow from cute little bundles of fur into large and noisy mastiffs. The multiplying number of dogs on the streets has prompted a vigorous, if one-sided, debate in official newspapers. Typical was a long letter published in the English-language China Daily in which a reader, Mr Zhang Huimin, described dog-ownership as 'deplorably out of harmony with a China that is still poor and trying to ensure a better standard of living for all'. Mr Zhang reported with 'disgust' a recent episode in which he had observed 'a not-too-clean-looking, curly-haired dog stop at the trunk of a young tree and unblushingly lift its short and fat hind leg high to send out a yellow jet of water'. Such graphic descriptions clearly struck a chord with Mr Cheng Musheng, a local Beijing legislator, who said he would be urging the authorities to pass an ordinance forthwith to ban 'noisy and dirty' dogs. Mr Zhang was also outraged by the spectacle of dog-owners lavishing special care and attention on their pets, including visits to dog beauty parlours. At Beijing's K P K World Pet Zoo Co Ltd - the capital's premier pet emporium  -which advertises a range of pet-care services including 'cosmetic beautifying' - the mood is gloomy as business has dipped sharply since dogs found themselves, well, in the dog-house with the authorities. People were visiting the store to look but not to buy, said Mr Liu Xuelu, the manager. 'These days only those who are opposed to dogs get the right to speak in the media. Others don't,' he said. Attitudes were less antagonistic under the rule of China's emperors and empresses, many of them noted dog-lovers. The Manchu Empress Dowager Ci Xi, whose devotion to Pekinese dogs was legendary, was said to have laid down the breed standard for the palace dogs as rigidly as she laid down the law for her humblest subjects on the remote frontiers of Tibet. 'Let the lion dog be small, with the selling cape of dignity round its neck and billowing standard of pomp above its back,' she declared. China's modern leaders have shown no such conspicuous affection for the four-legged creatures. Unlike in the west, dog-ownership is not yet considered a useful political prop in China - but times change. Mr Lai might be rather gloomy about the present chill towards man's best friend, but he believes dog-lovers will prevail. 'It's become an historical tide,' he says.</p>

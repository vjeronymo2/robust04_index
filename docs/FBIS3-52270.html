The source said it is not known yet who will accompany  Qaddumi but the delegation is expected to include several PLO  Executive Committee members, including Sulayman al-Najjab, Yasir  'Amr, and others.    The source said the talks Qaddumi will have with senior  Jordanian officials are extremely important, pointing out that  His Majesty King Husayn and President 'Arafat agreed last month  to hold such high-level meetings in Amman.    The Palestinian source stressed the PLO's concern about  having clear and frank relations with the Jordanian Government  to serve the higher interests of Jordan and Palestine. [passage  omitted]</p>

Garten [title as published] launched  torpedoes at the Brazilian law that regulates the purchase of  telecommunications products by calling it protectionist and  bureaucratic. Thus, he echoed the words of U.S. Commerce  Secretary Ronald Brown, who at the beginning of the month sent a  letter to Brazilian Science and Technology Minister Israel  Vargas condemning the protectionist attitude in government  purchases of technological products.    The Brazilian telecommunications market has tremendous  growth  potential. Brazilian Telecommunications, Inc. cannot meet the  demand for expansion and it would be great if telecommunications  prices dropped. The U.S. accusations are somewhat irresponsible.    The recently edited Brazilian law is strictly inspired by  American law. Here, exactly like in the United States, it has  been established that a public bid can be won by a national  company with up to 6 percent overpricing or even 12 percent  overpricing if it comes from a high unemployment area.    The point of view of Garten and Brown is more backward if we  analyze a public bid published a little more than a month ago by  the National Renewable Energy Laboratories, a U.S. public  institution that looks after renewable energy sources. The bid  will choose a solar energy system for Brazilian Electric Power  Company, Inc. in a joint research program. The bid establishes  that offers from foreign manufacturers will have a 50 percent  overpricing. And if the offer is the same as that of an American  company, the American company wins the bid. It is the typical  case of do as I say and not as I do.</p>

			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOMAN RESCUED JUST AS PLANE IGNITES;  </P> <P> CRASH: BYSTANDERS IN PACOIMA YANK WING OFF AND PULL UNCONSCIOUS PASSENGER TO  SAFETY. ALL THREE ABOARD SURVIVE.  </P> <P> Bystanders who saw a light plane crash on a Pacoima street tore a wing off the  craft and pulled an unconscious woman from the wreckage only moments before it  burst into flames Saturday.  </P> <P> "They're real heroes," said Sgt. Bruce Cowan of the Los Angeles Police  Department's Foothill Division. "If these people hadn't taken that lady out of  the back of the plane, she would have been killed."  </P> <P> The plane had just taken off from Whiteman Air Park, less than a mile away,  when the pilot radioed the tower that the engine had died, said Steve  Christmas, tower manager. "There was nothing we could do except watch it  crash."  </P> <P> The red-and-white Cessna clipped an air conditioner on the roof of a plastics  container company, lost a wheel, spun 180 degrees and then pancaked onto the  pavement in the 13500 block of Paxton Street, witnesses said.  </P> <P> Mary Ann Hanley, 37, of La Crescenta, was discovered unconscious in the back  seat of the plane after rescuers helped a male passenger get out, witnesses  said. The pilot walked away from the wreckage, they said.  </P> <P> Among those who raced to the scene was Leonard Archibeque, a 29-year-old  electrical helper for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, who was  driving on Paxton Street.  </P> <P> "After it hit the building and spun around, it just teetered on the edge before  it slid off and crashed," Archibeque said. "I parked right away and helped them  get the woman out. If we had gotten there a minute later, she would have been  dead. That fire was boiling real good."  </P> <P> Tyler Harwood, 29, of Northridge was asking directions at a nearby gas station  when the plane crashed.  </P> <P> "We couldn't get her out, so 15 to 20 of us let out a war cry and ripped the  wing off by yanking it upward," said Harwood. "It left a big hole and we  dragged her out. Two seconds later, we heard this loud pop and the whole plane  was in flames."  </P> <P> Ibrahim Shariff, 42, of Panorama City, who had been riding his bicycle to meet  a friend, said the bystanders had little time to plan their rescue.  </P> <P> "It wasn't something we discussed -- we just saw the cabin filling with thick,  black smoke and the flames getting closer and we acted," he said.  </P> <P> None of the three occupants of the plane were seriously injured, said Holly  Lyons, a nursing supervisor at Holy Cross Medical Center. Hanley suffered a  concussion. Passenger John R. Wilson of Burbank suffered a broken ankle while  the pilot, Harold Leroy Wessel, 53, of Sun Valley, was treated and released for  minor cuts, she said.  </P> <P> Wessel told police that he was flying to Mammoth for the weekend, Lt. Maurice  Rubio said.  </P> <P> The cause of the 9:22 a.m. crash is under investigation by the Federal Aviation  Adminstration and the National Transportation Safety Board, FAA spokesman Tony  Ina said.  </P> <P> Seven fire engine companies put out the blaze in eight minutes, Los Angeles  Fire Department Battalion Chief Bob Teachenor said.  </P> <P> A one-block stretch of Paxton Street, where the burned-out plane lay in the  eastbound lane, was closed all day between San Fernando Road and Sutter Avenue,  police said.  </P></p>

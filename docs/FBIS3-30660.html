Vladimir Suman, deputy of the government coalition Civic  Democratic Alliance (ODA) and chairman of the Defence and  Security Committee, told CTK after the meeting that "no problems  in this respect are being expected." The NATO mission was led  by NATO Assistant Secretary General Gebhardt von Moltke.    Suman said that Moltke explained to the deputies the  fundamental principles of Partnership and acquainted them with  expected positions of individual participating countries  (non-members of NATO) towards the project.    The Czech deputies informed the NATO officials on the course  of action the parliament would take on Partnership. "We  primarily stressed that we are prepared to exercise control over  the army and to take in parliament all the measures necessary  for the implementation of the project. We said we would strive  to influence people's stand towards the army and NATO and  contribute to the transformation of the Czech Army so that it  would be capable of meeting the conditions set for the admission  to NATO," Suman said.</p>

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / India to liberalise insurance market India is likely to announce sweeping changes to its tightly-controlled insurance industry, including moves to end the state's long-standing monopoly of insurance and open the industry to foreign companies. Mr Manmohan Singh, finance minister, is expected to outline his plans for the industry's biggest upheaval since life insurance was nationalised in the 1950s, in his 1994-95 Budget speech, due next month. Insurance industry reform is seen as an important element in the general overhaul of India's financial markets, which in turn forms a central part of the government's economic liberalisation programme. The basis of the officials' actions will be a report presented last week to Mr Singh by a government-appointed committee headed by Mr RN Malhotra, a former governor of the Reserve Bank of India. Mr Malhotra and his colleagues recommend privatising the two state-owned giants of the industry, the Life Insurance Corporation and the General Insurance Corporation, which handles non-life insurance. With their subsidiaries, the two corporations have virtual monopolies in their markets. Reflecting India's cautious approach to privatisation, the report recommends the state should retain 50 per cent stakes in each corporation. To promote competition, the General Insurance Corporation's four operating subsidiaries should be made managerially independent. The report proposes foreign insurers wanting to enter the Indian market should be encouraged to invest through joint ventures with domestic partners, rather than on their own. The committee suggests new entrants should face tough conditions, including a minimum capital requirement of Rs1bn (Pounds 21m) and a pledge to carry out a fixed minimum amount of business in rural districts. Indian industrialists have complained the proposed minimum capital level is too high and will discourage potential entrants, though it is unlikely to prove a hurdle to big foreign insurance groups eyeing the Indian market, notably Sun Life of the UK which has a joint venture with the Life Insurance Corporation selling insurance to Indians in Britain. The extent to which the finance ministry will implement the report will depend on the reaction of the industry's trade unions, concerned liberalisation could bring job cuts.</p>

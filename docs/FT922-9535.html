			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Switzerland (3): A paragon is humiliated - The country's economic problems ONCE HELD up as a model for the industrialised world, the Swiss economy has lost its allure. Switzerland has suffered a deeper recession than any European Community country, its inflation rate is above the OECD average, unemployment is at its highest level in more than half a century, and the former rock-solid Swiss franc is looking feeble. An economy as open as Switzerland's could not hope to insulate itself from the world economic slowdown, which has been longer and more pronounced than predicted just a few months ago. Imports and exports account for some 40 per cent of Swiss GDP. However, the drop in national output last year of 0.5 per cent was tempered by buoyant exports to the booming German market, which takes nearly a quarter of all Swiss merchandise exports. By the same token, this year's recovery will be weakened by the slackening German economy, not only through the effect on exports but also through the higher Swiss interest rates necessitated by the German Bundesbank's tough monetary stance. Most economic forecasters are predicting export-led growth of 0.5-0.9 per cent in 1992, concentrated in the second half, as the world economy picks up steam. But even in 1993 GDP is not now expected to exceed 2 per cent, which will make little dent in the unemployment total. For the Swiss, accustomed to tight labour markets and negligible unemployment, the rapidity of the climb in joblessness has come as a shock. Just a year ago, 35,000 people - 1.1 per cent of the workforce - were registered as unemployed. Even this was high by comparison with the 0.5-0.8 per cent rate common for much of the 1980s. But in March 1992 nearly 76,000  -2.5 per cent  - were out of work. The total is still rising. The surge in the numbers out of work contrasts with the recession in the early 1980s. Companies have been readier to lay off surplus staff this time around and redundant workers have been readier to register as unemployed. Unemployment benefits are more generous than 10 years ago, the social stigma attached to unemployment has lessened, and women and foreign workers have not withdrawn from the labour force as they did in the past. Most of the country's 1.2m foreigners - who make up a quarter of the workforce - now have long-term residence rights. Despite the mounting jobless total, the Swiss government has firmly rejected calls by the trade unions for reflation and large-scale job-creation. This refusal partly reflects a long-standing federal government policy of eschewing intervention in the economic cycle, as well as the need to curb government spending. But it also reflects fears that reflation would hinder necessary structural adjustments to reverse the country's declining long-term competitiveness. The high costs of doing business in Switzerland, a shortage of skilled workers and a legal system that permits projects to be held up for years by appeals, have led multinational companies to move production, and even research facilities, abroad. The decision last December by Ciba-Geigy, the country's biggest chemicals group, to locate a genetic engineering research centre just over the border in Alsace, was a recent example. But even at the end of 1990, the 15 biggest Swiss enterprises employed 684,700 people - 82 per cent of their total workforce - outside Switzerland. Government and industry are in accord that the Swiss economy suffers from excessive regulation and too much cosiness in business. Heading industry's wish list, aside from participation in the EEA and eventual EC membership, are a relaxation of strict restrictions on skilled foreign workers, a change in Swiss competition law to ban cartels, which are widespread, the introduction of VAT (rejected by Swiss voters last year) to replace the present unsatisfactory sales tax, and less regulation, especially in the labour market. These objectives are shared by the much-vilified Swiss National Bank (SNB), the central bank, which has been struggling to control an unruly bout of inflation sparked off by an inadvertent over-relaxation of monetary policy in 1987-88. The subsequent monetary tightening, accompanied by high interest rates, precipitated the recession by hitting investment, especially construction, and has prevented any decisive recovery. Inflation has subsided from its peak of 6.6 per cent last summer to just under 5 per cent in March, but is expected to fall only slowly to 3-3.5 per cent next year. Mr Markus Lusser, SNB president, says there is no room for any significant loosening of monetary policy. The Bank says its policies have been less effective than they should have been because of important structural rigidities in the Swiss economy. These include widespread indexation, notably of rents (tied to mortgage rates) and of wages (linked to prices), steep rises in public sector charges and the high degree of cartelisation in industry as well as one of the most protected farm sectors in Europe. The fight against inflation has also been hampered by the weak Swiss franc, which has lost about 10 per cent of its value against a trade-weighted currency basket since January 1991. The SNB decided not to follow the rise in German rates last December, so as not to squash the first signs of economic recovery. But it was subsequently forced to intervene heavily in the money and foreign exchange markets earlier this year when the currency tumbled, threatening to push up inflation once again. Some commentators, such as KOF, a leading economic forecasting institute, have suggested that counter-inflation policy would be more credible if the Bank abandoned the pretence of an independent monetary policy and declared a floor or band for the Swiss franc against the Deutschemark. The Swiss parliament has asked the government to examine Swiss membership of the European Monetary System. EC economic and monetary union may soon be the order of the day. But, as Mr Jean-Pascal Delamuraz, the economy minister, has said, Switzerland would not currently qualify for EMU because its inflation rate is too high. For a former economic paragon, this is humiliation indeed.</p>

			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> The National Stuttering Project has won a slight victory in its beef with the  movie "A Fish Called Wanda," which features a character who stutters. Dimension  Cable TV in Orange County, which is carrying the film this month, is airing a  public disclaimer on its community-access channel. The 10-second, typewritten  disclaimer, taken from a letter written by "Fish" producer Michael Shamberg,  states, "The film makers of 'A Fish Called Wanda' do not want viewers to draw  any negative inferences about people who stutter or be misinformed about the  nature of the disorder." The disclaimer is airing in the mornings with other  community-service announcements. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

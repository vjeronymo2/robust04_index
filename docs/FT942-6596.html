			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / French business leaders rally behind imprisoned Schneider chairman French business leaders yesterday rallied behind Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, chairman of Groupe Schneider, the French electrical engineering group, imprisoned in Brussels since Friday on charges of fraud. The arrest of the Schneider chairman also prompted high-level exchanges between the French and Belgian governments, although both sides declined to confirm Belgian television reports that Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, had telephoned Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, his Belgian counterpart, concerning the issue. In an advertisement placed in the Journal du Dimanche, the French Sunday paper, 35 prominent French businessmen pledged their support for Mr Pineau-Valencienne, testifying to his 'moral rigour, ethics and competence'. In Brussels, however, there seemed little sign of an early release for the Schneider chairman. The Belgian Justice Ministry said it would respect the decision of the investigating judge, Mr Jean-Claude Van Espen, who detained Mr Pineau-Valencienne on charges of fraud, embezzlement, falsification of annual accounts and abuse of confidence. Under Belgian law, Mr Pineau-Valencienne must remain in prison until the judge decides whether the charges should be confirmed. His court appearance has been set for Wednesday. The charges against Mr Pineau-Valencienne relate to a complaint by minority shareholders in two Belgian Schneider subsidiaries - Cofimines and Cofibel. They claimed that Schneider's 1992 bid to buy them out had undervalued their shares. An agreement between the minority shareholders and Schneider was reached earlier this year after the French group raised its offer price, but an investigation by the Belgian authorities into the management of the two subsidiaries, which was launched last September, has continued.</p>

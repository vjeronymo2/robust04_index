			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd by Edward </F> Sturton in London from the "Midday" newscast -- recorded]    [Text] [Sturton] What are your views on Major's remarks  last night on a multispeed Europe?    [Hurd] We are at the heart of every discussion and there are  core rules, the kind of rules for example which prevent the  Germans from excluding British beef, the kind of rules which  make the French admit British airlines to Orly, which make us do  sometimes things that are in the agreed rules, and that's  important, and there are other things which we do because we  agree and it suits us to do them, things we call the two other  pillars of Maastricht, foreign policy, home affairs policy, the  efforts against the international criminal, we cooperate there  as governments because we want to tackle the problem together,  that's how Europe is developing.    [Sturton] But the last time you tried to take a stand, which  as you put it, suits Britain and not the rest of Europe over the  blocking mechanism in an enlarged community, you were forced  into a humiliating climbdown.    [Hurd] We compromised there, and you will see when the time  comes next year that the compromise works well from our point of  view, but that was nothing to do with the national veto.    [Sturton] And I did not suggest it was.    [Hurd] No, no the national veto is the crucial part.    [Sturton] But can you give me one example when the sort of  flexibility that you are talking about has actually been used  successfully?    [Hurd] Of course, a whole number of things which when we  started talking about them we were a lone voice, subsidiarity,  minimum interference, enlargement of the community, the single  market, all these were ideas which we started talking about  then, were not well received and now the orthodoxy is actually  happening, that is progress being made, but defense, frontiers,  the ERM, these are all examples were we already have a  multispeed Europe.    [Sturton] Can I ask you finally, foreign secretary, were the  sort of contortions you all have to go through, for domestic  reasons during an election making your life difficult in the  Council of Europe?    [Hurd] I really cannot accept that, the ideas which the  prime  minister put forward from Maastricht on the idea I put forward  for the example at our Scottish party conference a few weeks ago  -- the ideas we are putting forward in this election campaign,  this is a very clear and coherent idea of the way we think  Europe should go in the interests of Britain and other peoples  in Europe, it is different from the old fashioned idea with  which you and others occasionally are besotted, that the only  good European is one who believes in moving power inexorably to  Brussels, that is not our Conservative view, we have a positive  view about Europe, and that's the view we are consistently  putting across.</p>

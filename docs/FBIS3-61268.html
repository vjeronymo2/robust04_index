			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Minkin: "President Acts Like a Czar: </F> Boris Yeltsin Repeats Boris Godunov. With the Same Success"]    [Text] It is impossible not to indulge in rereading "A  Comedy About a True Calamity Upon the Kingdom of Muscovy, Czar  Boris, and Grishka Otrepyev."    BORIS:    For me there is no happiness, I thought to calm my  people With prosperity and glory, To win their love  with generous gifts.    I remember how the price of gasoline was doubled before the  referendum. People went wild; you could cut the cursing with a  knife at the gas stations. Suddenly, the price hike was  repealed. Shumeyko innocently announced that the hike had been a  political mistake. Everybody immediately understood  that the hike was not repealed--just postponed.    Shortly before the elections, the generosity was far more  extensive. A week before the fateful date, the minimum wage was  doubled. (Having doubled, it rose dramatically to one-fifth of  the poverty level. The only happy people are GAI [state  motor-vehicle inspection] personnel, who calculate their  extortion in multiples of the minimum wage).    And on the eve of the elections, the favors poured as if  spilling out of a worn-through sack:    Yeltsin signed an edict giving the MVD [Ministry of Internal  Affairs] the right to set base salaries and the size of  additional categories of cash allowances.    Yeltsin signed an edict raising pensions.    Yeltsin signed an edict raising pensions for persons born  before 31 December 1931.    Yeltsin signed an edict on improving the system of state  allowances and payments to families with children and increasing  their size. Beginning 1 January, there will be a monthly  allowance for each child....    Cheap moves. Expensive inflation.    Doctors, teachers, and other "budget-financed" folks all got  handouts. Everybody, absolutely everybody, got some presents.  And what good did it do?    Commission an independent survey. Ask: Has at  least one person who got a raise changed his mind in favor of  Russia's Choice (the president's party)? Have they managed to  buy even one vote? Has not this shower of generosity produced  the reverse effect: You want to buy me cheap? here, I will show  you!    I opened the granaries for them, I scattered Gold  in their midst.... But raging, they cursed me!    They will say: This was a planned generosity, benefits  conceived a long time ago. I will not believe it. Why then was  this bundle of favors was announced so rudely the day before the  election?    Are we not people? Do we not feel humiliated by such sudden  benevolence?    And how can a humiliated person get even with authority?    By not showing up at the polling station or by checking  off--out of spite--a different square on the ballot.    A sad paradox. Of the entire of Boris Godunov, we  best remember "The people are silent"--a phrase Pushkin never  wrote! We remember what Zhukovskiy added to the play in order to  fool the censors.    Pushkin had a different attitude toward the people. But look  first how Grishka Otrepyev, an insolent thief, an pretender  speaking different languages, talks to people:    PRETENDER:    Everything conspires in my favor: both people and fate  --Who are you?    POLE:    Sobanskiy, a free Polish gentleman.    PRETENDER:    Praise and regard to you, the child of freedom!  Give him one-third of his allowance in advance.  --But who are these?    KHRUSHCHEV (Russian):    We are your Diligent and persecuted serfs;  Disgraced, we have escaped from Moscow.    PRETENDER:    Take heart, innocent sufferers, Just let me get  to Moscow. Czar Boris will pay for all this. Who are  you?    KARELA:    A Cossack. I was sent to you from the Don By free  hosts, by brave atamans, By Cossacks from the upper and  lower reaches of the Don.    PRETENDER:    I used to know Don people. I had no doubt That I  would see in my ranks the Cossack standards. We thank the  Don host of ours. We know that the Cossacks now Are  oppressed unjustly and persecuted. But if God helps us to  ascend To our fathers' throne, we will honor the old  tradition To favor our loyal free Don.    Sounds familiar? Typical Zhirinovskiy intonations. His  teacher was not stupid when she pounded into their heads: The  classics always remain contemporary.    Half of the voters did not show up at the polls. (Even less  had been expected. By the edict on elections, one-quarter would  have been enough). Some did not go out of captious snobbishness:  This is beneath me, they said. Others out of a certainty that  everything had been decided in advance anyway: An echo of  previous decades--whether you show up or not, it is still 99.9  percent.    Brothers and sisters! Our brains--all of us--still operate  in  the Soviet mode. The state is an enemy. It rapes us with  residence permits, sticks us into labor camps, sends us to the  BAM [Baykal-Amur Mainline], robs us with taxes, strangles us  with forms to fill out, makes us deal with boorish bureaucrats;  the militia is an enemy, the judges are enemies; they grab our  young men and send some of them to the tundra and others to  Afghanistan; slogans are lies, promises are lies;  we-will-live-under-communism; mind-honor-and-conscience;  let-us-respond-with-shock-labor-to; the food program; apartments  for everyone by the year 2000; everything for the good of the  individual....    For decades, the state worked hard to make people hate it.  Hatred toward the government has become a part of our flesh and  blood. Live by law and die. You want to live--know how to  circumvent it. For decades (generations!) people lived in a  country where the rulers, newspapers, radio, and television  constantly lied, lied, lied.    We all grew up and lived in a society where it was  considered  valorous to cheat on the state. And stupid to observe the rules.    Our national hero is a crook. Ostap Bender. There are as  many  films about him as about Lenin. And an honest man is a fool, a  laughingstock for everyone.    An American action movie: The hero is a policeman. Our  movie:  The hero is a thief. Govorukhin himself played gangsters, not  procurators.    Hatred toward the authorities. This is how Yeltsin won  against Gorbachev. The whole world loved Gorby, but the Soviet  people were for Yeltsin! He took a dip, he looked extremely  slumberous during his appearances in America; the KGB set traps  for him every step of the way--and it all worked in his favor.  Gorbachev had the Army, the KGB, the omnipotent apparatus, but  the people chose Yeltsin! For his wise program? For his promise  to get rid of privileges? No. Yeltsin was against our  dear party-and-government. That was all. And quite enough.    Now Zhirinovskiy has played this card and won. Do people  really believe his babbling about free vodka? Do they thirst for  Khazanov to be executed by firing squad? Do they want to fight  on 33 fronts simultaneously? No. But Zhirinovskiy is against the  authorities. That is all. And quite enough.    BASMANOV (commander in chief of the Muscovite Army):    We have sufficient forces, thank God! I shall  inspire them with victory; And you--whom will you send  against me? Not Karela the Cossack? Or Mniszek? And  are there many of you? Why, a mere eight thousand.    PUSHKIN (an adherent of the Pretender):    You are mistaken; you will not find even that number of  them--I myself say it, our army is rubbish, The  Cossacks merely plunder villages, The Poles merely boast  and drink, While the Russians.... there's no denying  it.... With you I'll not dissemble; But do you know  what we are strong in, Basmanov? Not in our army, no, not  in Polish aid, But in opinion--yes! In popular  opinion.    The people are not silent. Do you understand?    There is a tremendous difference between Yeltsin and  Zhirinovskiy. Yeltsin promised reforms, which is very difficult  to do. It is hard and long, and nobody knows how to do it, and  there is much theft, and many lies....    Zhirinovskiy promises war. This is very easy. Just give it a  push! And then it will keep moving on its own. Once you start a  war--try to stop it.    Remember how the Georgians saw the suppression of Abkhazia  as  an easy stroll. A day or two; maximum a week. And now  Shevardnadze crawls on his knees: Take us into the CIS! Give us  bread! We are dying! War has devoured the well-fed, blessed,  rich, resort-like Georgia. And it continues to devour, picking  the bones.    One thing is good--Zhirinovskiy's victory woke Yeltsin up.  He  finally learned the true worth of his advisers, the cunning  courtiers.    Stankevich, Bragin, and others have been fired.    That Bragin was professionally and otherwise unfit to serve  as the radio and television chief was clear to everyone from the  very beginning. It was clear BEFORE he was appointed. The flight  of the best people from Ostankino, the idiotic agitation and  propaganda--he got away with everything. Finally, on 3 October,  Bragin, out of cowardice and stupidity, shut down Channel 1,  plunging the country into a shudder of horror. And  afterwards--rewards, kisses, medals. God deliver me from fools.    What good has the FITs [Federal Information Center]  accomplished over the time of its existence? What has it  accomplished at all? A gigantic, very rich agency had been  bestowed upon a favorite, but other than getting into scandals  with the procuracy, Poltoranin has not accomplished anything  whatsoever. Actually, this is not correct. The night after the  election, he celebrated at the Feast of Democracy, drank  champagne to the New Political Year, and hugged Zhirinovskiy.    Since Poltoranin has not given any reason to suspect him of  being gay, we have to consider his heavy petting with Zh. [an  allusion; both the name Zhirinovskiy and the Russian obscene  word for derriere--"zhopa"--start with the letter Zh.] as having  a political, rather than sexual, overtone.    A farsighted political P. [prostitute]. (This is not me  about  Poltoranin--Lenin said this about Trotskiy).    What other heroic deeds should the hapless Kozyrev commit to  be dismissed from his job for innumerable flops in Russian  foreign policy? Having watched Kozyrev for three years saying  "Yes, yes, yes" to America and Western Europe, one begins to  feel nostalgic for Gromyko, with his "No, no, no."    And what did we get as a result of endless concessions? What  kind of presents? Seven pills of aspirin per capita of bad  population?    The weak are disliked; the stupid get no respect; and liars  are hated.    As a result, we have icy relations with the nuclear Ukraine.  And jubilation in Pentagon: Hurrah! The end of thaw! Kravchuk is  clinging to his nuclear bombs; the mad hawk Zhirinovskiy has won  the elections--this is enough for the Pentagon to hammer $20  million-$30 million out of Congress. Oh, the Cold War--that was  a golden time! A generals' time! Why did Bragin kiss  Zhirinovskiy? Why not kiss Grachev?    What else does Grachev have to do to get dismissed? The  Western Group of Troops has rotted on the stalk. Traders-general  transport booty by military aircraft....    The Army must love and respect its commander. You cannot  make  people face death by giving them salaries and apartments. These  are not very smart hopes. Salaries and apartment exist to keep  the Army from mutiny, no more than that. They do not instill a  fighting spirit. Only love, respect, and fear push people into  battle. Salaries and apartments are a market. A market operates  on different criteria, different incentives, different values.  When you are facing a wall of firepower, an apartment is not  part of your conscious mind.    Does the Army love Zhirinovskiy? You bet! He promises it war  and conquest. Which means medals, fame, and riches. The Army is  sick and tired of being despised, of riding in tanks across the  motherland and the capital.    Zhirinovskiy, of course, promises money and apartments, but  he does not have them. Realistically, all he can give is war.    Guys! Soldiers and sailors, sergeants and corporals,  officers, generals, and admirals, do understand: Zhirinovskiy is  no Napoleon and no Suvorov; it is not the eighteenth century,  and the time of brave conquests and crusades is over.    Friend Saddam did try to stick his hand into Kuwait,  plundered a bit, did some shooting, but very soon got hit on the  head, and now sits in his bunker and knows that at any moment....    What the Russian Army needs is not Grachev and not  Zhirinovskiy. The Russian Army needs Lebed. Very tough (perhaps  even cruel), but one can see right away: He does not steal, and  he is not a traitor.    The Russian Army should get a person it trusts and who will  not sell it off.    As to Grachev.... He is a minister, of course, except for  one  small problem--the Army does not follow him. Give it to Lebed  before Zhirinovskiy takes it. Whether Lebed will agree to take  it is another question.    And if again--after such lessons!--the apparat games  continue.... Well, then we will continue rereading Pushkin and  will keep coming across this terrible remark of the cunning  courtier:    SHUYSKIY:    Well then? If Boris does not give up his sly ways  Let us begin to skillfully incite the people.</p>

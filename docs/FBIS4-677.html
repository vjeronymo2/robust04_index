			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 14 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party  [IFP] officials were meeting at a Johannesburg hotel Thursday  [14 April] morning amid continuing uncertainty about the  international mediation process.    The process was meant to start on Wednesday morning but was  delayed because of a dispute over the terms of reference for  mediation. The dispute arose from the IFP's objection to a  reference to the election date in the new terms of reference  drawn up after the government joined the process as a full  participant.    The IFP has argued that agreement on constitutional issues  would lead inevitably to negotiations on a new election date, a  position rejected by both the government and the African  National Congress.    A spokesman for the international mediators said they had  held discussions with the parties and were preparing to release  a statement during the course of the morning.    A draft agreement between the government, the African  National Congress and the IFP was reached after talks in  Pretoria involving representatives of the three parties. The  agreement suggested a two- phase approach to mediation whose  effect would be to separate the question of the election date  from the terms of reference.    The draft agreement was discussed with the mediators at a  meeting late on Wednesday night. However, the draft was awaiting  the final approaval of the IFP before the mediation began.</p>

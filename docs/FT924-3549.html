			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Doubts on going concern message - Auditors' reports of 'little value' says a recent study AUDITORS' reports in annual accounts are of little value in showing whether a company's survival is threatened, an academic study has found. There is little correlation between the incidence of the 'going concern' doubts and Auditors' reports of 'little value' says a recentstudy corporate collapse, according to a paper by Mr David Citron and Professor Richard Taffler of the City University Business School in London. Under existing guidelines, auditors are supposed to qualify the accounts of any companies over which they believe there are materials factors which could threaten its survival. But Mr Citron said yester day: 'The going concern qualification is not giving a very substantial message. The study, based on an analysis of the accounts of the 107 UK quoted industrial and distribution companies which failed during 1977-86, showed that only 26 per cent had a going concern qualification. These were the companies which were very clearly financially weak and about to fail. Auditors often claim they are restrained from giving a qualification for fear that the company might collapse as a result. But the study shows that 71 per cent of companies given the going concernqualification survived, and the failure rate was no higher among these companies than those in which theaccounts were not qualified. The report does suggest that auditors may not qualify the accounts for fear of losing their contract with the client. Companies which were given a going concern qualification and survived were more likely to switch their audit firm. Overall, small audit firms behaved no differently than the largest nine firms. The findings are particularly relevant because the Auditing Practices Board earlier this year launched a discussion document calling for substantial changes in the 'going concern' qualification. Under the proposals, auditors would be required to assess more actively the directors' view of the company as a going concern over the coming 12 months. They should use their judgment to identify 'material matters' such as inadequate borrowing facilities, litigation or significant debts falling due which might jeopardise its position. The value of the audit report in the presence of going concern uncertainties: an empirical analysis. City University Business School, Frobisher Crescent, Barbican Centre, London EC2Y 8HB.</p>

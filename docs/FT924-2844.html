			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Charity Fund Investment (4): Charitable belts tighten - Voluntary groups face reductions in local authority support LOCAL VOLUNTARY groups, many already badly hit by cuts in support from local authorities in recent years, fear that 1993-94 will be even more difficult. Local authority budgets are going to be under severe strain as a result of government efforts to contain public expenditure; the National Council for Voluntary Organisations expects this to lead to further reductions in the support councils give to the voluntary sector. It believes there will be particular problems for organisations providing personal social services, those relying on inner city grants and voluntary sector training providers. NCVO officials have protested to Mr Michael Howard, the UK environment secretary, at proposed reductions in planned Urban Programme funding from Pounds 231m to Pounds 176m in 1993-94. 'Voluntary organisations are major recipients of Urban Programme funding,' says Mr Simon Hebditch, NCVO assistant director. 'It is another cruel blow to voluntary organisations working in areas of high unemployment and social deprivation.' Job creation, training, welfare, housing, advice, recreation, environmental and education projects are all likely to suffer, says Mr Hebditch. Even before the autumn statement, many local authorities had begun imposing cuts in voluntary sector funding, freezing budgets at last year's levels or refusing to accept any new applications for finance. The overwhelming extent to which local organisations depend on public sector financial support is shown in the first-ever analysis of sources of voluntary sector funding in the capital carried out for the London Boroughs Grants Unit, which awards local authority grants. Although many corporate donors could not specify what proportion of their national programmes went to London, the research concluded that private sector support amounted to only around Pounds 3m in 1991-92 - compared with Pounds 264m from local and central government, health authorities and grant-making trusts. London has some 30,000 voluntary groups providing a striking array of services. But just over half the total funding was devoted to health and welfare services and a further 20 per cent to education and training. Almost all the rest went to organisations involved in housing, the arts, recreation and the environment. A Pounds 5m office, conference and resource centre for voluntary groups in London is planned in the former Jones Brothers department store in Holloway Road, Islington. The venture is a partnership between the London Voluntary Service Council and the City Parochial Foundation, one of the largest grant-making trusts in the capital. It is intended that the centre, which could open next year, will provide a library, information service, exhibition space, conference hall and catering and creche facilities as well as more than 16,000 square feet of office space. Some low cost accommodation will be reserved for new voluntary groups seeking to establish themselves. Workers in London's voluntary sector are enthusiastic about the scheme, particularly as it comes at a time of repeated cuts in resources. Mr Tim Cook, clerk to the City Parochial Foundation, says it would put 'something in place that will help hundreds of groups for years to come.'</p>

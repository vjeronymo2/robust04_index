			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Private medical insurance The chancellor proposes to limit the rate of tax relief on private medical insurance for the over-60s to 25 per cent; change the way of giving relief so it no longer affects other parts of the tax system; remove the requirement that the Inland Revenue must certify private medical insurance contracts before they can attract tax relief; and make two minor changes to the rules governing the availability of relief. Changes to the rate of relief and the way of giving relief will come into effect for premiums paid on or after April 6 1994. The requirement for certification will be abolished from July 1 1994. The chancellor's intention is to simplify the relief and to restrict its cost in future years.</p>

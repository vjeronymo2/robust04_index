			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: UK government stand on biodiesel hits farmers Sir, You published two interesting articles, 'Trees branch out', about coppicing on set-aside land for energy uses, and 'The cleaner choice', about concerns on particulate emissions from diesel engines (both Business and the Environment, February 9). We would like to point out that the use of biodiesel (made from rape seed oil) has been shown to reduce particular emissions from diesel engines by up to 50 per cent. In 1994, about 250,000ha of set-aside land will be used to grow oil crops for biodiesel production and the potential is much larger. In France, Italy and Germany, tax exemption is given (under certain control systems) to promote the use of biodiesel and hence the development of the set-aside policy. Unfortunately, the UK government has to date refused to apply the same scheme, to the detriment of UK farmers, diesel users and the environment.

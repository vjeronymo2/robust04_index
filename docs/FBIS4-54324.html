			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 27 (KCNA) -- Korean scientists and  technicians came up with more than 140,000 inventions and  technical innovation proposals contributing to the  implementation of the Workers' Party of Korea's revolutionary  economic strategy in the last one year.    New breeds and farm machines invented by the Academy of  Agricultural Science are now very effective in practice.    The Kum Song General Tractor Works, the Chongpyong Farm  Machine Accessories Factory and cooperative farms in Pyongwon  and Chungsan Counties manufactured new-type weeding machines,  granulated fertilizer and manuring machines and other machines  and solved technical problems in raising the effectiveness of  fertilizers and preventing damages from noxious insects and are  widely using them in agricultural production.    Tens of thousands of inventions and technical innovation  proposals have been introduced in production in the light  industrial sector. They include a new pattern loom of high  economic effectiveness and a technology of papermaking by use of  fibre in waste water.    Besides, many scientific and technological problems, such as  a high pressure pipe heater and a new coal-cutting method, have  been successfully solved in various fields of the national  economy including the coal, power, metal, electronics and  automation industries.</p>

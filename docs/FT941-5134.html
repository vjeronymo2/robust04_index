			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Pict Petroleum drops to Pounds 1.9m Pict Petroleum, the small exploration company, yesterday announced a 35 per cent drop in interim net profits from Pounds 2.92m to Pounds 1.87m because of the absence of currency gains following the devaluation of sterling last year. Currency gains fell sharply from Pounds 1.38m to Pounds 85,000. Mr Peter Everett, chairman, said the currency effect and net profits decline masked a strong underlying performance, with the operating return for the six months to December 31 77 per cent higher at Pounds 1.65m. The return was achieved in spite of a marked weakening of oil prices from an average of Dollars 18.76 per barrel to Dollars 15.13. Turnover rose by 57 per cent to Pounds 7.52m. The increase was largely due to an early contribution from the Scott field in the North Sea, which came on stream in September. The company reached record production levels of 737,400 barrels of oil equivalent, of which some 220,847 had been produced by the Scott field. Pict was determined to continue its exploration programme, and had budgeted about Pounds 8m for projects this year. The company also said it intended to pursue further acquisitions abroad. Pict ended the first half with cash of Pounds 15.5m against Pounds 14.8m last year. Net debt was Pounds 13.5m, equal to 29 per cent of shareholders' funds. As in previous years, there is no dividend. Earnings per share fell from 5.66p to 3.62p.</p>

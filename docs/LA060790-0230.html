			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> WEATHER DAMPENED RETAIL SALES  </P> <P> Unseasonal weather in parts of the country made May a sluggish month for  retailing, major chain stores reported today.  </P> <P> Big general merchandisers and discounters as well as specialty and department  stores posted modest to middling sales gains for the month.  </P> <P> "We believe the May sales results were disappointing but principally reflected  adverse weather conditions in the second half of the month, particularly in the  East and Midwest," said Merrill Lynch retail analyst Jeffrey Feiner.  </P> <P> Colder-than-normal temperatures and unusually heavy rainfall in some areas were  blamed for keeping customers away from stores. The abnormal conditions banished  thoughts of buying new summer apparel or seasonal merchandise, such as air  conditioners and outdoor furniture.  </P> <P> Sears merchandise group said its sales for the four weeks ended June 3 edged up  0.9% to $2.5 billion. No. 2 ranked K mart Corp. posted a 10.4% May sales  increase to $2.44 billion. May Department Stores Co. reported a 9% sales  increase to $725.2 million, while The Limited Inc. said its sales rose 16% to  $359.7 million.  </P></p>

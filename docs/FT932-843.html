			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Ghosts in the machines: Disputed transactions between UK banks and their customers Of late, Steven Raw has become something of a seer around the streets of Nelson. When 23-year-old Mr Raw sees people brandishing plastic cash cards in the Lancashire town, he cautions of the fate that could befall them. 'Everyone I see around town now, I warn. I say 'Watch what you are doing with those cards.' You cannot be too careful.' Mr Raw, a worker at a medical fabrics company, speaks from bitter experience. He is in dispute with Barclays Bank over Pounds 600 withdrawn from his account through automated teller machines, the 'holes in the wall' on which banks increasingly rely to dispense cash. The dispute arrived in the London high court this week after two years of acrimony and suspicion. Mr Raw is not alone in arguing with his bank over whether someone else took his money. This week's judgment that nine people with similar claims against banks and building societies can proceed with a mass legal action threatens to provoke a flood of disputes. Banks face being haunted by 'phantom withdrawals'. His dispute is typical. It started two years ago when he received a three page Barclays statement listing a series of withdrawals from cash machines that he did not recall making. He still had his card, and he says he had not told anyone else the four-digit personal identification number (Pin) with which he identified himself when using his Connect cash card. He went to his local branch to complain, and met with an upsetting response: the bank did not believe him. It had records of transactions, and its technical experts believed it impossible for anyone who did not know Mr Raw's Pin to break its codes and take his money. Mr Raw found suspicion falling on himself and his girlfriend. 'I went mad with them. I went down there thinking it was a computer error, and they would just credit it back but they said it must have been me,' he recalls. The dispute got harsher, until Mr Raw had a piece of luck. His parents saw a television news item about a firm of Merseyside solicitors pursuing phantom withdrawal cases. Things took a better turn after he contacted the firm, J Keith Park, which took up his case. Barclays wrote to Mr Raw offering to refund Pounds 425 of the disputed amount, citing the code of practice introduced last year, and which limits customers' liability in most cases to Pounds 50 of the disputed sum. There are two reasons why the banks have taken such a stern attitude on disputed transactions. First, they are becoming increasingly reliant on cash machines as they close branches and switch staff away from being cashiers towards selling other products such as insurance. TSB is among banks experimenting with sophisticated ATM machines on which customers can carry out transactions such as switching money between accounts. Although cash machines accounted for only 4 per cent of money transmission  -or 1bn transactions  - in 1991, the banks calculate this could quadruple by the year 2000. This means that they are wary to acknowledge that such machines could be fallible. 'The biggest worry about this affair is that there could be a breakdown of trust,' says one banker. The second reason is that the banks find a true case of 'phantom' withdrawal inconceivable. This would be a case where a thief managed to extract money from someone's bank account without knowing the Pin number of their cash card. The reason is that banks' security effort has above all been directed at ensuring that it is impossible to crack Pins. 'It puzzles me totally,' says Mr Paul Dorey, head of information security at Barclays. 'Machines can make mistakes, but it is beyond the world of possibility that our systems could make up transactions in the way this implies.' In Barclays' case, Pin numbers are generated by a computer at the centres where cards are manufactured, and are transferred to the central computer against which transactions are checked. They are not seen by staff, or coded on the magnetic strip on the back of cards. The only person who sees both the card and the Pin number is the account holder to whom they are sent separately. When the customer presses the Pin into the ATM keypad, an electronic 'black box' encrypts the number so that it cannot be intercepted, and sends it to the mainframe ' via another computer if the ATM is owned by another bank. The computer decrypts it and sends an authorisation message. The cash machine records each transaction on paper roll. Mr Dorey argues that it would take four sets of software to go wrong simultaneously in the same way to record a falsely authorised transaction. Fraud would require someone either to know the Pin, or to break the code encryption. The latter has never been known, according to Mr Richard Tyson Davies, of the banks' Association for Payment Clearing Services. For these reasons, the first reaction of banks has often been to accuse customers either of fraud, or of carelessness. Banks say that most cases of 'phantom' withdrawal into which they inquire turn out to be relatives or friends of the customer who have discovered the Pin. Yet despite the banks' denial of the possibility of pure 'phantom' withdrawal, they are having to admit that incidents that look very like it have occurred. One example is staff fraud. In a notorious case, a Clydesdale Bank computer engineer stole Pounds 17,000 by recording Pins on a portable computer as the bank's customers used ATM machines. More broadly, there have been cases where cash withdrawals have been applied to the wrong account. Among the cases being pursued by J Keith Park is one of a man whose card took cash from someone else's account, apparently because the wrong magnetic strip had been placed on the back. The washing of such dirty linen in public is one effect of the mass action, which banks believe could take up to three years to settle. It has yet to be decided in what form, or in what courts, individual cases will be argued. While banks fear a loss of confidence in cash machines, an even greater worry might be a wave of similar claims. On this point at least, the banks and their opponents are united in scepticism. One reason is the banks' decision to change their code of practice, limiting customer liability to Pounds 50, except where a customer has been 'grossly negligent' by disclosing a Pin number. A second reason is that banks are working on reducing errors and fraud. Barclays has announced that it is to install cameras at six of its cash machines, and banks are working together on innovations such as 'watermarking' the magnetic strip on cards to prevent fraud. But even if there is no rush of claims, the treatment of customers such as Mr Raw has ensured that they face a damaging dispute. Mr Dorey of Barclays says Pin numbers need to be 'treated with respect'. Yet banks are paying the price for not having treated customers that way. 'They told me their machines were foolproof, but I know otherwise now,' says Mr Raw.</p>

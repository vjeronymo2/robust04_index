			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Galbraith's Visit to RSK `Extremely </F> Dangerous'"]    [Text] Knin -- Borivoj Rasuo, information minister in the  government of the republic of Serbian Krajina [RSK], yesterday  sent a letter to RSK president Milan Martic in which he put  forward his personal views regarding President Martic's demand  that his ministry organizes a meeting with the U.S. Ambassador  to Croatia Peter Galbraith. In his letter, Minister Rasuo says:    ``The meeting with the U.S. ambassador to Croatia on the RSK  territory, in the circumstances in which the RSK finds itself --  of which the most important one is that the RSK has not been  internationally recognized yet -- is extremely dangerous because  the visit of Mr. Peter Galbraith to the RSK could be interpreted  as extending Croatia's sovereignty over the territory of our  state, which is in any case unacceptable. Furthermore, because  Mr. Peter Galbraith is continuously putting forward a view that  the RSK is an integral part of Croatia.    ``For this reason, Mr. Martic, I will not be able to  participate in any aspect or any form in the organization of a  meeting with the U.S. ambassador to Croatia, a country with whom  the state in whose government I am a minister is on hostile  terms through no will and blame of its own.    ``Second, for the duration of the unscrupulous media war  that  the Croatian journalists have been waging against the Serbian  people as a whole and thus also against the Serbian people in  Krajina -- a media war that threatens to grow into a real armed  aggression by Croatia against the Serbian Krajina, as the  Croatian leaders are announcing -- I believe that Croatian  reporters must not be granted permission to enter our state  territory. The Information Ministry will not issue them with  press passes. Bearing in mind such a stance, it is thus  understandable that there is no need for the organization of a  reception for the Croatian reporters in the RSK.    "Beside this, I inform you, Mr. Martic, that I am not  willing  to share the responsibility for the decisions that I do not make  and in the passing of which I make no contribution. On any  other occasion, when my consent and consent of the government  whose member I am will exist regarding decisions to be passed  and whenever we agree something in advance without the need for  persuasion, you can count on my assistance and cooperation."</p>

			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A LATE burst of activity in the stock index futures market enlivened what had otherwise been reported to be a dull session, writes Joel Kibazo. The March contract opened at a premium of 33 and buyers were seen. The upward direction of the contract did not last and there was a wave of mid-morning selling, further encouraged by the release of disappointing retail sales figures for the Christmas period. A poor opening on Wall Street reinforced the dull market mood and a weak finish was expected. However, minutes before the close a recovering Wall Street and an order for 50 contracts triggered heavy buying. That was followed by another large buying order. Independent traders were left short, generating a large squeeze in the last half-hour of trading and pushing the underlying cash market higher. March closed at 2,593 for a premium of 49 to the cash market and around 27 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash, but turnover was a meagre 4,432. In traded options, volume reached 28,343. The FT-SE Index had 4,285 contracts dealt. Storehouse was the busiest stock option with 2,305 lots traded. Asda was the second most active on 2,185 contracts transacted.</p>

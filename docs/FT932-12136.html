			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / International Company News: Rivals join Packer in TV licence bid MR KERRY PACKER appeared likely to win a dominant role in Australian subscription television yesterday after rival commercial channels joined a consortium led by his Channel Nine network. The consortium, which includes Telecom Australia and News Corporation, Mr Rupert Murdoch's US-based media group, looks set to win one of two four-channel subscription television licences being offered by the government. The inclusion of the smaller Network Seven and Network Ten organisations was announced shortly before the deadline for bids expired at 4pm yesterday. Analysts said neither company had sufficient financial strength to bid alone. Mr David Beddall, communications minister, refused to say whether any other bids had been received for the so-called B licence, which is open to both domestic and foreign companies. However, two other potential bidders, Mr Steve Cosser's Australis Media and Mr Tony O'Reilly's Australian Provincial Newspapers, said they had not submitted bids. Several US companies have expressed interest in bidding for the A licence, which is restricted to companies which are not already active in the Australian media. Bids here are believed to have been received from Continental Cablevision and Time Warner, although it was unclear whether the US groups were co-operating or competing. The government is expected to announce the highest bidders for the two licences on Friday. However, the winners will require approval from the Trade Practices Commission, the competition regulator, to proceed. A successful bid by the Channel Nine consortium would establish Mr Packer, proprietor of the privately owned Consolidated Press Holdings media group, as the dominant force in Aus-tralian broadcasting. It would also mark a return to Australian broadcasting for News Corp, which would be restricted to a 20 per cent shareholding in the consortium under foreign investment regulations. News Corp controls 70 per cent of daily newspaper circulation. The group operated a national commercial television channel before being forced to divest by cross-media ownership rules. Analysts said the consortium's access to programming from Channel Nine and News Corp's growing Fox network in the US, would make it a strong competitor in the potentially crowded subscription television market. In addition to the winner of the A licence, the consortium would be in competition with the government-owned Australian Broadcasting Corporation, which has been granted a separate two-channel subscription licence. The inclusion of Telecom gives the consortium significant technical flexibility if problems emerge in the development of the unproven digital transmission system which will be a condition of both licences. Telecom is developing a cable transmission system using telephone lines which it believes will be commercially and technically viable within two years, posing a potentially serious challenge to satellite transmission.</p>

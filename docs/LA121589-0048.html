			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE 'PRICE OF A PAL' STRIKES A CHORD  </P> <P> Regarding veterinary costs, the subject is a microcosm of the dilemma with  human medical costs.  </P> <P> The advance of medical insurance and charity meant the doctor did not have to  discuss his bill with the patient. It was sent along to the insurance company  and the full amount was paid.  </P> <P> The insured didn't care how much the doctor was charging because the insurance  company paid. The insurance companies simply raised their premiums. The  employers who paid those premiums used the tax system as a cost of doing  business. Ever since socialized medicine has been discussed, putting a lid on  how much will be paid to the medical establishment, doctors have been  frightened into charging more and more to reap as much money as they can before  the free lunch is over. They have diversified into drug stores, hospitals,  insurance companies (talk about monopolies).  </P> <P> Now the veterinarians have started down the same path. Your article states that  there is a "recession" among the veterinary profession. Maybe people simply  cannot afford to take their pets to pet hospitals as much as before. Insurance  and charity are the cause of inflation for the care of animals, not the cure.  </P> <P> Keep the veterinary doctors competitive by putting pressure on them to keep  costs reasonable instead of seeking ways to protect a guaranteed financial  expectation. There are no sacred, immune professions.  </P> <P> KATHERINE A. KEYS, North Hollywood  </P></p>

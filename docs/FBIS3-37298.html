			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kiev, 15 Feb -- As UNIAN already reported on 14  February, Yevgeniy Saburov -- a well-known Russian economist,  who will in fact be heading the Crimean Government -- is to  begin fulfilling the duties of Crimea's deputy prime minister  [as received] in the near future. Crimea's Constitution does  not envisage the post of prime minister; the Cabinet of  Ministers is led by the president of the autonomous republic.    In a conversation with a UNIAN correspondent on 15 February,  Mykola Mykhalchenko, head of the service of the president of  Ukraine for domestic policy issues, noted that Saburov cannot be  appointed to any state post as this runs counter to Ukrainian  legislation, in particular Article 4: On public service in  Ukraine, which indicates that the right to a state post belongs  to citizens of Ukraine.    According to Mykhalchenko, without Ukrainian citizenship  Saburov can only lay claim to a consultant's role in the  apparatus of Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov. The head of the  service of the president of Ukraine for domestic policy issues  also stressed that he considers Saburov's utterances on  introducing the Russian ruble on the peninsula in parallel with  the Ukrainian karbovanets to be populist ones.</p>

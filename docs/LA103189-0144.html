			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> GREAT NORTHERN TAKEOVER TARGET  </P> <P> Georgia-Pacific Corp., one of the largest lumber companies, today launched a  $3.2-billion bid for papermaker Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. in a merger that  would create the world's largest forest products company.  </P> <P> Great Northern stock surged $18.75 to $61.50 in heavy early trading on the New  York Stock Exchange, hurtling past the $58 that George-Pacific offered for each  share.  </P> <P> But Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific's stock dropped $2.25 to $51.125 as traders  bet that it could be headed for a costly acquisition fight.  </P> <P> Great Northern, headquartered in Norwalk, Conn., said the bid was uninvited,  but Georgia-Pacific appeared determined to push forward with the offer and  perhaps sweeten it.  </P> <P> The combined forest products company would top other leading forest products  companies such as International Paper Co. and Weyerhaeuser Co. in sales, with a  combined total of nearly $14 billion.  </P></p>

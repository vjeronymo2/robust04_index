			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Management: Zil's two-way stretch - The successful restructuring of the Russian flagship company could act as a catalyst for change Bit by bit, Russian reform is ceasing to be a matter of exclusively macro-economic and political consideration and is being devolved to the enterprises and to their managements. The changes which Russian managers must now usher in dwarf, in their scale, anything likely to face their western counterparts. But if Russia is to succeed, these western counterparts will be increasingly drawn into the great drama which surrounds the integration of Russia into the world economy. Privatisation has passed through its first stage - in which almost three quarters of the state property were pushed out, higgledy piggledy, into private hands through the medium of privatisation vouchers issued free to every citizen. A second stage, the period of strategic investment and company restructuring, is set to begin. Within this process, there is a small group of massive, flagship companies where a successful restructuring would act as a catalyst for change far beyond their own limits. One such is Zil, the Zavod Imena Ligacheva or Factory Named after Ligachev (its founder) - once called Zis, or the Factory Named after Stalin. It gave its name to the vast limousines built since the 1920s for the state and party elite; it was the biggest lorry producer in the former Soviet Union; it produced small,top-of-the-range buses; it made a wide range of engineering products for other plants; it had a large, white-goods division. Says Alexander Vladislyavlev, its present chairman: 'It got the best, the cream of the Soviet engineers; it got the best equipment. When the state decided to set up another big truck plant (Kamaz, in Tatarstan) Zil engineers went out and did it.' It was politically privileged and untouchable. Its long-serving director, Yevgeny Brakov, was a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party. In his office next to the Zil museum, where the steady progress of the enterprise from workshop production to vast combine was displayed, he was first among the country's industrial barons. He was sure of the first call on resources, his products were on every state farm, in every army division, in many homes - and beneath the bottoms of the Politbureau members as they were whisked to and from the Kremlin. Its crash has paralleled that of the Soviet Union and in its own way is as spectacular. The writing might have been on the wall when Brakov was put up by the party to oppose the upstart renegade Boris Yeltsin, when the latter ran for the Moscow deputy's seat in the USSR Supreme Soviet elections of March 1989 - and received 392,633 votes against Yeltsin's 5,118,745: it was an early sign that the Party-state web, without which Zil had no meaning, was beginning to unravel. With the ending of the Soviet Union in December 1991, the tolling of the bell for Zil grew louder. It suffered from the 1992 cuts in the defence budget - nearly half its trucks went to the military. It suffered as agricultural subsidies were hit - the other half went largely to the state and collective farms. People bought fewer fridges, as more and more of their disposable incomes went to buy the produce which went inside them. The government tended to buy from Mercedes, and the nouveau riche would rather be seen dead than in a Zil (which do, indeed, make good hearses). By 1993, the crisis was upon it. Instead of restructuring, Brakov went back to his Bolshevik roots: in early 1994, with many of his workers part-time and their pay dropping, he encouraged them to picket the White House (government offices) to demand state aid. His point was partly taken - though it did him no good. Both the federal government and the Moscow City government became alarmed. Zil was just too big, too well known, too prestigious to go belly up. It was the equivalent of Chrysler, of Rolls Royce. The market could not be allowed to decide its fate. From the latter half of 1993, Russian ministers began voicing concern about Zil: Alexander Shokhin, the deputy premier for economics, used a visit to Washington to ask the International Finance Corporation to get involved. The European Bank of Reconstruction and Development was also coaxed in. Yuri Luzhkov, the Moscow mayor began to exercise the rights and responsibilities, which a 25 per cent stake held by Moscow City Council following privatisation gave him. He promised to assist and did so by taking over the 500,000sq m of apartments it owned - and with these the kindergartens, the rest homes and the cultural and leisure facilities it ran. But this kind of relief was a palliative. The change had to come from within  -and at the top. Following government pressure and behind-the-scenes dealing, Zil's main shareholders - Moscow City Council, AMO Bank, the Mikrodin finance group and its workers and managers (who hold 40 per cent of the shares) - gathered in Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium and elected a new board of directors with Vladislyavlev (representing the Moscow City Council) as chairman. Vladislyavlev is a man of power. A former member of the Central Committee, his post-Soviet career has been built up in tandem with that of Arkady Volsky, head of the Russian Industrialists Union, whose deputy he is (Volsky was once the leader of the Communist Youth League, or Komsomol, in Zil). Now, he says he is focused on being a company chairman - and doctor. As the international financiers who are now huddled round Zil attest, he has moved with speed. In doing so, he has demonstrated the mixture of flamboyance, use of Soviet-era connections, partial grasp of current management practice and inside-government horse trading which is bound to be reproduced in other big Russian restructurings. First, Vladislyavlev capitalised on what was already partly in place. The US companies Caterpillar and Paccar, keen to enter the Russian market, had already moved to form joint ventures. Caterpillar had created a joint venture to make fuel systems, and is interested in joint production of trucks through its joint venture Novotruck and engines through a similar entity, Novodiesel; Paccar is to make heavy trucks with Novodiesel engines. Talks are also going on with General Motors and Renault. Zil offers these companies an existing manufacturing base for joint ventures. Next, he is constructing a structure where the monolithic combine will be split up. A holding company is being created, which will wholly or partly own subsidiary companies - of which Zil Manufacturing will retain the engineering heart of the enterprise, and other divisions will service and market the products. He has formed an international marketing alliance with the Avtotraktor export group, which has rather moribund subsidiaries abroad and which still retains, he says, a core of professional staff. Soon after his election as chairman, Vladislyavlev moved Brakov aside - he is now a vice-president in charge of marketing - and promoted Valery Saikin, a production man, as general director. The promotion of middle managers to senior positions - he says they are 'the best people available in Russia, in the first class' - is going ahead. His flamboyance and imagination shows in his willingness to complement the deals with foreign partners with the appointment of a high-profile 'consultant'. Currently he is trying to secure the services of Lee Iacocca, the former Chrysler chairman, among others. 'They should come here and teach the people in Zil what they know. We need a special institute for teaching marketing and sales. Zil never had to sell anything before.' Vladislyavlev has also used his pull within government. He has secured promises of off-budget support and tax breaks and is arguing strongly (as did the previous management) for increased tariffs to protect the Russian car industry. The government, anxious for the flagship, has committed itself to assisting the continuation and upgrading of the gas guzzlers. They will order 24 each year, and put up some Dollars 70m (Pounds 45m) a year for remodelling. This, the 'masterplan', is still sketchy and raw, still being developed. Vladislyavlev and the Russian government are pushing hard, trying to persuade the international financial institutions to commit money, make connections. He has won admiration for his bustle and energy. But will it work? The doubts centre round the sheer size of the task of restructuring and the political risk attendant on getting it wrong. Zil is, as Vladislyavlev says, a supreme product of the Soviet era. Shorn of any marketing or finance skills, it has to acquire a new culture from scratch. Its lorry design is archaic (they are still petrol driven) and its once captive markets wholly or partially destroyed. The International Finance Corporation, which helped restructure Skoda in the Czech Republic (a large but still easier task), is hesitant; so is the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. 'What they need is a white knight which would take the job of restructuring, put in some of their own money and tough out the opposition. But this is so high risk I don't see that coming,' says one senior official - speaking, as almost everyone does on this touchy issue, on grounds of anonymity. There is also some question as to why the two Russian finance companies, AMO Bank and Mikrodin, will not put up the required cash for restructuring. Here one sees a now familiar problem: foreign finance asks why it should invest if the Russians are withholding, while the Russian companies, unsure of the nature of the risk, watch foreigners to see where they will invest before committing their own funds. And Zil waits. Yet Vladislyavlev, with a good international contacts book and the ambition to 'make sure my grandson, who loves to work with his hands, will work in Zil when it is a great Russian company selling to the world', continues to push its claims. He is offering 10 per cent of the stock (whether existing shares or a new issue is not clear) to a large international finance house for Dollars 60m, with a seat on the board thrown in - a price which, as another international finance official says, 'is either a tremendous bargain if it can be saved or a complete waste of money if it can't'. Russian restructuring is still in the realms of faith. Investment is increasing: a few manufacturers, led by Percy Barnevik of ABB Brown Boveri, are leading the column of western investment into working plants. Everyone, from Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, down, trumpets success over the horizon. A successful management revolution at Zil would bring the horizon much closer.</p>

			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEMOCRATS APPEAR TO RALLY 'ROUND NUNN  </P> <P> Senate Democrats appeared Wednesday to be rallying around Armed Services  Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) in the wake of Republican attacks on his  fairness and a newspaper report of a drunken driving incident he was involved  in 24 years ago.  </P> <P> The attacks on Nunn escalated Tuesday when the Wall Street Journal editorial  page took the unusual step of reprinting a 1972 article from the Atlanta  Journal on the automobile accident.  </P> <P> White House lobbyists conceded that Democrats' reaction to the attacks appeared  to dim still further John Tower's chances of being confirmed as defense  secretary. Many Democrats, they said, now seem to feel that any support for  Tower would be viewed as implied criticism of the respected and popular  committee chairman.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lawyer at the Time  </P> <P> According to the article, Nunn, then a 26-year-old lawyer, hit a parked and  unoccupied car, then drove into a ditch on his way home from a late-night  Halloween party in 1964. He later paid a fine for leaving the scene of an  accident.  </P> <P> The Wall Street Journal accompanied the reprint with an editorial denouncing  Nunn and the Senate Democrats for using ethics as a political weapon in the  fight over the Tower confirmation. Nunn later in the day issued a statement  saying that he had been under the influence of alcohol at the time and that the  incident "taught me a lesson" he said he had never forgotten.  </P> <P> The episode may be more damaging now to Tower than to Nunn. Because it had  previously been reported in Georgia, the fact that it has been reported again  does not seem likely to affect his political fortunes there. In the Senate, the  story seems to have caused some sympathy for Nunn and no sign of any reduction  in his influence.  </P> <P> Tower supporters had been circulating the story about Nunn's accident to other  news organizations, including The Times, for more than a week prior to the  Journal's reprinting of the Atlanta article. Robert L. Bartley, editor of the  Journal's editorial page, declined Wednesday night to discuss whether the  Journal's decision to reprint the article had been sought by Tower supporters.  </P> <P> In addition to the Journal story, Senate Republicans Tuesday and Wednesday made  a series of statements criticizing the nomination process that Nunn presided  over. Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), for example, called the process  a "hatchet job" and said that Tower had been "shabbily treated."  </P> <P> Asked whether he was directly accusing Nunn of being unfair, Dole called him  "partisan" and added: "The facts are going to indicate what his motives are."  </P> <P> Nunn publicly dismissed the attacks. "This is hardball," Nunn said in an  interview late Tuesday with a Georgia radio station. "I suppose when you're in  the hardball game you get bruised."  </P> <P> But a senior White House adviser, saying the attacks had seemed to increase  Nunn's determination to defeat the nomination, conceded that the strategy was  likely to backfire. He insisted, however, that Administration officials had not  inspired the attacks although, he said, "we can't control the actions of  others."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Democrats Praise Nunn  </P> <P> Nunn's Democratic colleagues, meanwhile, went out of their way to praise Nunn  in their comments on the Tower nomination Wednesday. Senate Majority Leader  George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), for example, referred to him as "one of the most  respected, if not the most respected, members of the Senate."  </P></p>

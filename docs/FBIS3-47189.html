			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Hiroaki Ito] </F>   [Text] Washington, 21 Dec -- On the question of setting  numerical targets -- a focal issue in the new Japan-U.S.  economic talks -- the United States' attitude has apparently  softened. For instance, Secretary of State Spallow [name, title  as published] formally announced on 21 January that the United  States is "not asking to set targets for market shares (of  foreign products)." This may be interpreted as a move to probe  for a point to bring the talks to a conclusion. Several factors  may have contributed to the change in the U.S. Government's  attitude -- such as U.S. President Clinton's unswerving economic  policy of "giving priority to getting results even at the cost  of making concessions," and his consideration for Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa, who is in a difficult position over such  issues as political reform.    The economic talks started with a not-too-clear agreement on  "setting objective criteria to measure progress of market  liberalization" at the Japan-U.S. summit in July. In the course  of the talks, Charlene Barshevsky, deputy U.S. trade  representative (USTR), demanded that Japan "improve the market  shares of foreign products to the level practiced in the seven  major industrial nations (G-7) within a few years. Japan  reacted negatively toward the demand, insisting that "setting  numerical targets goes against Japan-U.S. agreements."    In attempting to understand the reason for the U.S.  softening  its attitude, a parliamentarian concerned said: "Making  concessions, striving for substance rather than agreements in  name only, is the usual routine of the Clinton economic policy."  Concerning the rice issue, the United States abandoned its  stand on "tariffication without exception" but succeeded in  drawing concessions from Japan by presenting a compromise to it  in the form of a "special measure." Consequently, it succeeded  in securing for itself the "substance" of assured participation  in the Japanese rice market and stepped-up liberalization of  beef and citrus products markets.    A senior USTR official said: "Judgments on whether Japan has  made progress in opening up its market will be reached by taking  into account several factors in a comprehensive manner -- not by  whether or not certain numerical targets have been reached."  However, he also added: "If there are gaps in judgment between  Japan and the United States, the United States will take action  based on its own judgment." In other words, the United States  can decide to put the U.S. Trade Act into motion, depending on  its judgment. This would mean that "the United States could  compromise on the question of numerical targets, but there is no  change in the effect of putting pressure on Japan."    Another factor is the consideration given for the difficult  position Prime Minister Hosokawa is now facing. Bowman Cutter,  deputy assistant to the President, is said to have spent much  time when he was in Japan recently gathering information  relating to the future of the Hosokawa government. In the White  House, there are many who view positively the market  liberalization and deregulation policies advocated by Prime  Minister Hosokawa -- regardless of whether he has real power or  not.    In a news conference on 20 December, Mickey Kantor, U.S.  trade representative, made a remark supporting the prime  minister in an indirect way, saying bureaucrats should be  sensitive to what the prime minister seeks to achieve.  Undersecretary of State Spallow [name, title as published] has  also viewed Prime Minister Hosokawa's policies in a positive  light. The official's concern was apparent when he said: "It is  not good to press Prime Minister Hosokawa, who is in a difficult  position over the issues of budget formulation and political  reform bills."    Another point to note is that there has been a gap of views  between the Office of the USTR on one hand and the White House  and the Department of State on the other from the beginning.  Under Secretary of State Spallow has said, "the United States  has never talked about numerical targets," and White House  officials have also been conspicuously cautious. But people  like Barshevsky, deputy U.S. trade representative, have demanded  setting the numerical targets, going so far as to assert, for  instance, that "Japanese bureaucrats function better when they  have concrete targets."    It is highly possible that the United States is employing in  the economic talks the strategy of Trade Representative Kantor,  who was a lawyer formerly, of "making as many demands as  possible in the beginning, and then conducting negotiations on  them later."    However, while attitudes may have changed superficially, it  does not mean that the Clinton government has given up its  intention of including in the agreement figures of market shares  held by foreign products of companies from the G-7 nations. The  White House has suggested that "standard G-7 market share  figures should be included."</p>

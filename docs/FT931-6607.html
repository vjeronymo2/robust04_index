			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / S Africans get the taste for disclosure: Pressure is growing on government to clean up its act IN THE twilight months of white rule, South Africans have discovered a taste for public disclosure: not just for chilling revelations of human rights abuse, but for evidence of economic crimes and misdeeds that have been buried for years under apartheid - and would probably have brought down a government in any western country. Over the past week the auditor general, Mr Peter Wronsley, has published the accounts of government departments and statutory bodies showing widespread mismanagement and abuse. Local newspapers have attacked the large perks paid to government ministers. And a member of parliament from the liberal Democratic party pointed out in the House that, although financial scandals involving R5bn (Pounds 1.1bn) in expenditure had been disclosed over the past 18 months, no minister had been sacked or had resigned. Some 35 government officials are under investigation for corruption, 16 have been or are being tried, with six convicted so far. The unspoken message is that the white government must clean up its public management act before handing over to a mostly-black administration. Most whites and some blacks assume, by African precedent, that this will do an even worse job of managing public finances. However, exasperation with the ruling National party has reached such levels that white callers to a recent popular phone-in show, on Johannesburg's Radio 702, have begun to say regularly that they cannot imagine a black government exceeding National party mismanagement. The auditor general's report for last year condemns weak management systems and inadequate financial controls, especially in the South African Defence Force (half of whose budget is earmarked for secret funds, on which he did not comment) and the Department of Foreign Affairs, which provides billions of rands in funding annually (R5.4bn last year) to the nominally independent homelands of Transkei, Ciskei, Bophuthatswana and Venda. Mr Wronsley found, overall, that he could not publish unqualified audits for three government departments and 14 statutory institutions, and that he could express no opinion on the accounts of two other government bodies. But he condemned most severely the black homelands for failing to keep to financial guidelines, overspending on salaries and poor project controls, and said he doubted whether Transkei, Venda and Ciskei could repay some R3.3bn in debts guaranteed by South Africa. Threatened now with reincorporation into a unitary South Africa, homeland officials are widely suspected of siphoning off large sums as protection against an uncertain future. Only a day later, parliament's joint committee on public accounts criticised projects by the now-disbanded secret military unit, the Civil Co-operation Bureau, widely alleged to be involved in the murders of anti-apartheid activists: the committee questioned R13m in what it considered unauthorised or improper spending. As the new South Africa approaches, allegations abound of government officials fiddling with pension entitlements to insure against racially motivated retrenchments. This includes a recent case in which 4,000 white teachers were offered early retirement (with pension) by the white education department, but left free to sign up for fresh employment (and a new pension) with the separate departments which administer non-white education. Whatever its shortcomings, the National party is likely to pay no immediate price for poor administration of public funds: South Africans know they have no choice but to continue supporting the party if they seek a stable transition to majority rule. But as the Johannesburg daily, Business Day, commented last week, the public must continue to demand accountability or 'the voting public will have only itself to blame when the pattern of corruption continues'.</p>

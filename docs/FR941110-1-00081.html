			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Another option EPA is considering would require all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importers of used controlled substances to apply each year for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permit. Such a permit application would need to be submitted to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA between November 1 and November 15 in the year prior to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control period for which it would be applicable. The permit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application would include the person's name and address, their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importer identification number, and the intended quantity of used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substance that the person estimates will be imported  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the control period. The estimates would not be binding,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but would provide EPA with information on the total potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> import of used controlled substances for the U.S. for that year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA would need to make a determination within 30 days of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receipt of an application. If the application is denied due to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insufficient information, the person would have 5 days in which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to appeal the decision. EPA would then have an additional 5 days  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in which to deny or grant the permit. If EPA did not act in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5 days, the permit would be granted automatically. A person  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wishing to import used controlled substances who did not apply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for a permit during the designated time before the control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period, may submit an application at any time during the year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, EPA would maintain the right to review the application  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within 60 days of its receipt. A 60-day review of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application is justified by the fact that the person is applying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outside of the designated time for processing permits. Any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> person receiving a permit outside of the designated time period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for application would be required to apply again for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following control period, during the designated period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

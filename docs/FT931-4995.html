			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Japanese business confidence tumbles JAPANESE business confidence suffered a further sharp fall between November and February, raising the prospect of a round of sharp cuts in employment in the next few months, according to the Bank of Japan's quarterly survey of business conditions, published yesterday. Manufacturing companies' assessment of business conditions stood at minus 49 per cent, 5 points down from the November survey. Among non-manufacturers, the index stood at minus 33 per cent, a 6 percentage point fall from the earlier survey. The index measures the balance of companies reporting conditions as favourable minus those reporting conditions as unfavourable. The so-called tankan survey of 688 leading companies is widely regarded as the most authoritative assessment of the short-term outlook for the Japanese economy. The survey suggests that manufacturers will have to cut costs further in the next few months, while non-manufacturers and small businesses are becoming increasingly pessimistic. Despite deep cuts in production, manufacturers have not made much headway in reducing their inventories of unsold products. About 38 per cent of manufacturers reported they had excessive inventories, about the same level as August and November last year. Demand is expected to remain very weak, with 51 per cent of manufacturers reporting excess supply of products and 23 per cent reporting excess production capacity, up by 2 percentage points from November. Most companies said they expected a moderate rise in domestic and export sales in the financial year from this April. However, the survey was conducted before the recent surge in the value of the yen, which is likely to depress export sales. About 19 per cent of manufacturers said they had excess labour, up from 13 per cent in November, which suggests there will be further job cuts in the next few months. Mr Jim Vestal, Tokyo chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the stockbroker, said these cuts could further depress the economy: 'Further cuts in employment will depress consumption as people will save more as a precautionary measure.' Companies expect to cut investment by 4.2 per cent next year, with cuts of 9.9 per cent in manufacturing and 4.1 per cent in service industries. Mr Robert Feldman, Tokyo economist at Salomon Brothers, the stockbrokers, said the forecast cuts were shallower than had been expected. Profits may recover marginally in the next financial year, ending a three-year decline, with manufacturers forecasting a 4.4 per cent rise in profits and non-manufacturers a 1 per cent improvement.</p>

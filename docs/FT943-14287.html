			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Cuts Treasury driven, says Labour: Backbench Tories applaud defence paper Labour yesterday accused the government of making cuts in the armed forces to meet the Treasury's demand for financial stringency rather than for operational reasons. But backbench Conservative MPs, some of whom have expressed concern on this issue in recent months, applauded the defence report, arguing that it would enhance military effectiveness in the long term. Mr Donald Anderson, a Labour defence spokesman, welcomed some of the proposals in the document, including an enhanced role for the Territorial Army and the creation of a rapid deployment force. But he questioned why, if the cuts were justified, they were not part of the last defence review in 1990. He claimed that the principle of cutting support services was undermined by the fact that more than 70 per cent of Royal Air Force personnel sent to the Gulf had been deemed support staff. 'Does that not show how spurious is this distinction between support services and front line in a modern, integrated service community?' he asked. Tory MPs were satisfied with the statement by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, believing that the government was reducing waste rather than operational effectiveness. 'They have sucked out a good deal of the fat and they have been very clever by getting a lot of suggestions from people in the business,' said Sir Jerry Wiggin, a Tory member of the Commons defence committee. 'They have broken down the legacy of empire.' Sir Archie Hamilton, a former defence minister, said: 'The concern all along is whether we would lose any defence capability. Instead, we've had an enhancement.' A number of MPs were concerned that the Ministry of Defence would faces further cuts in the forthcoming public expenditure survey. However, Mr Rifkind has privately told MPs that he has an unwritten agreement with the Treasury that defence will not be the target of further cuts. A number of Tory and Labour MPs were concerned that their constituencies would suffer job losses, and some Tories urged the government to reverse specific proposals. Mr David Shaw was particularly concerned at the proposal to transfer the Royal Military School for Music from Deal in his Dover constituency. 'To remove the royal school . . . would tear the heart out of the constituency,' he said.</p>

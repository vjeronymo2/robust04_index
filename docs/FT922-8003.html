			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Pentland US arm to float on NYSE with Dollars 120m-Dollars 135m tag PENTLAND, the sporting goods supplier which owns the Speedo brand name, yesterday announced that Authentic Fitness Corporation, its US affiliate, is to float on the New York Stock Exchange with a value of between Dollars 120m and Dollars 135m (Pounds 68m to Pounds 76m). Proceeds will be used to pay AFC's heavy debt burden, the legacy of a highly leveraged Dollars 85m management buy-out in 1990. After the float, AFC is expected to have about Dollars 20m in debt. AFC, which designs and sources Speedo in the US, intends to come to the market in July with 3m shares at a price to be pitched between Dollars 14 and Dollars 16. Pentland, which paid Dollars 10m for its 39 per cent stake in 1990, will see its holding fall to about 26 per cent. Mr Frank Farrant, finance director, said the float would benefit Pentland next year through an increased contribution from associated undertakings. AFC's high interest payments, which were Dollars 7.4m in the nine months to March 31 1992, would be substantially reduced, he said. AFC's pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 200,000 to Pounds 5m in the same period. Pentland had no intention of further diluting its holding in AFC, Mr Farrant added. The Dollars 10m investment had been written off 18 months ago and now represented a value of between Dollars 31m and Dollars 35m. The UK group retained its worldwide rights to the Speedo name and would continue to receive royalties from AFC.</p>

			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Management: Starck contrast - Alice Rawsthorn witnesses the design revolution under way at Thomson Consumer Electronics A look of disgust flashes across Alain Prestat's face as he grabs the television remote control pad. 'Ugh]' he groans. 'This is the sort of thing we used to make. Just look at it. It's so ugly. And user friendly? Huh] It's so complicated that you'd need a PhD to use it properly.' 'Ugly' and 'complicated' products will, if Prestat has his way, soon be part of the past at Thomson Consumer Electronics (TCE), a division of Thomson, the state-controlled French electronics group. Prestat has, in his two years as TCE's chairman, launched a mission to haul the heavily loss-making company back into the black and has hired Philippe Starck, the maverick French designer, to orchestrate a new design programme. When Prestat, 42, arrived at TCE in 1992 from his old post as an adviser to the French prime minister, the company was in a dismal state. It was the world's fourth-largest television manufacturer with interests across the brown goods market and brands such as RCA, Telefunken, Saba, Ferguson and Thomson. But it was losing market share and burdened by accumulated net losses of FFr5.5bn (Pounds 630m) from the four preceding years. Prestat spent his first two years at TCE slashing stocks and shedding staff. The company last year came back into the black at the operating level. 'After two years on the defensive we've built a solid base for the business,' he says. 'Now we're ready to deal with the long-term, strategic issues that we didn't have time for before.' One of the main issues is the design of TCE's products. Prestat realises that TCE's long-term prospects hinge on its ability to steal a march over rivals such as Philips and Sony in the intensely competitive consumer electronics sector. He believes consumers are bored by the 'grey boxes' that swamp the market and is convinced that imaginative design could give TCE a real competitive advantage. 'For years manufacturers have assumed that price and technology were enough to sell a product. But these days people don't see good technology as anything special. They expect it. What they do want are appealing products with their own identities,' he says. Angela Dean, European electronics analyst at Morgan Stanley, suspects he is right. 'This market is a nightmare for everyone,' she says. 'But it's particularly tough for the Europeans because the south-east Asians are not only more efficient at turning out televisions like cans of peas but at making them look more attractive. There probably is a demand for better-looking products. TCE can have a go - but it isn't going to be easy.' In the past TCE's designs were undertaken by in-house designers based at each of the company's factories where they worked to specifications provided by the marketing and technical departments. Prestat wanted the designers to be more pro-active and better integrated with the rest of the business. 'Design shouldn't be buried inside the company,' he says. 'It's got to be central to everything we do.' He was also anxious to ensure that TCE's designers took a fresh look at their work rather than simply refining old designs, or those of their rivals. A year ago he asked Philippe Starck to become TCE's artistic director. Starck, 45, made his name in the 1980s with witty work such as his spider-shaped lemon squeezer for Alessi, the Italian kitchen and tableware manufacturer, and the opulent Royalton Hotel in New York. His brief is to overhaul TCE's visual identity - from all its products to corporate stationery - thereby giving him the same degree of control as other influential corporate design directors such as Dieter Rams at Braun, the German electronics company. Whereas Braun employs Rams full-time, Starck works for TCE as a consultant. 'My role is to be a kind of corporate Candide,' he says. 'It's important for TCE that I continue to come in as an outsider to look at what everyone's doing. Prestat understands that.' His first big task, the redesign of TCE's European television sets, will act as a blueprint for TCE's new approach to design and product development. Starck has spent the past year working on the project in liaison with Prestat, his marketing and technology specialists and the new 16-strong European design team at TCE's Paris headquarters which includes some of the old factory designers and the young planeurs, or 'gliders', that Starck has hired on a freelance basis. The new designs form part of the overall reorganisation of TCE's European television business. When Prestat arrived the company had seven leading brands in Europe each with their own ranges of products and market positions. This meant that TCE missed opportunities to cut costs by pooling resources and that, sometimes, its own subsidiaries were competing against each other. The brands have now been rationalised into three 'families'. To achieve maximum economies of scale, each family has a unified range of products, which are sold, for the most part, under different names in different countries. Starck has identified a different personality for each brand to reflect its market position. He sees Thomson, the middle market brand, which carries the name Thomson in France, Ferguson in the UK and Nordmende in Germany, as a ''techno-zen' character - a buddhist monk who loves technology'. Saba, the cheaper range, which is sold as Brandt in France, is 'younger and funkier', Telefunken is the 'grand bourgeois who loves a grand gesture'. The completed designs are being kept under wraps at TCE's Paris headquarters until the first new products (a third of the entire range) are launched in May with the rest coming out next year. The only clues as to what the new products will look like lie in Starck's one-off TV sets for Saba and Telefunken launched last autumn. Both look dramatically different from anything else on the market. The Telefunken set has an elegant 1940s feel with a sweeping glass screen and mahogany case. The Saba mixes green plastic and recycled woodchips. 'There's no reason why televisions should have to come in boring cardboard boxes,' says Starck. 'We want our products to be fun to buy - just like opening a Christmas present.'</p>

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Eastern German farming needs more pruning - Labour cuts have not gone far enough to put the agricultural sector back on its feet THE OUTSIDE of the cafe had been smartened up and the food served inside was well up to western standards. But beneath the new paint it was still possible to glimpse the scars of 40 years of neglect. The grocer's shop next door was in a similar state and the newly-installed shelves were an obvious indication of recent investment. But most of the rest of the buildings in this village of Buchholz in the former East German land of Brandenburg, 50 km (30 miles) south-west of Berlin, still looked drab and unloved, much as they did under the communists. I was visiting the local farming company. Less than three years ago most of its land and farm buildings formed the basis of a production co-operative. But these are no longer permitted under the united federal government. All 4,500 that existed under the previous regime have been liquidated to be converted into partnerships or corporations or split up into small farms. Responsibility for this rural restructuring is with the Berlin-based Treuhand and although it is now more than three years since the wall came down much still remains to be completed. Indeed the Treuhand is still having to administer hundreds of farms, many of which are insolvent and still losing money. Reasons for the slow progress are many and varied. In spite of a reduction in the total farm labour force in the five former eastern lander from 848,000 to 208,000 there are still probably twice as many as can be profitably employed. But an even more serious problem is the continuing dispute over ownership of thousands of individual parcels of land. Back in May 1945, when the Russians took over the administration, the new rulers confiscated all the farms of more than 100 hectares (250 acres). Of the total East German land area of 6m hectares one-third was taken and in 1949 redistributed in small parcels among farm workers. It was not until the second phase of the communist land reform, which began in 1953, that all of the farmland including the small farms created in 1949, were thrown together and merged into large co-operative units. Later still the management of arable land on the now massive farms was separated from that of the large intensive livestock units that had been built on it. The Treaty of German Unity which was agreed in 1989 decreed that only those farmers, or their successors, who were forced into co-operatives from 1953 onwards would be entitled to reclaim their land. The original larger landowners whose farms were confiscated in 1945 were given no rights to recover their property. Since then, however, test cases have been brought to the federal courts by some of those landowners and it has been conceded that they should have been better treated. It remains to be seen how ownership of the 2m ha involved will be resolved between those who claim historical rights and those who were given confiscated land by the East German government in 1949 and have since believed it was theirs. Needless to say, however, binding decisions on who owns what are central to the security and viability of the new farming corporations. The one in the village of Buchholz is a good example. Under the communist regime the 1,200 ha carried 1,500 cattle (of which 500 were dairy cows) and ran an intensive 300-sow pig breeding herd, finishing all the progeny for meat. The labour force was 110 people. As the managing director admitted while we enjoyed some refreshment in the village cafe it was quite a shock when the community suddenly found itself having to try to operate according to market forces. Indeed when the magnitude of the problem was realised there was a temptation to dissolve the whole enterprise. After further consideration, however, it was decided to form a limited company from among the workers and attempt to make the farm profitable. The pig enterprise was closed because the buildings, put up only 12 years before, were inconvenient and would have taken more labour than could be afforded. The enormous impractical concrete sheds now stand empty as a monument to a failed system. A review of the cattle operation revealed that it too was losing money by European Community standards, and numbers were drastically reduced. The beef enterprise was cut to just 70 head of bull beef and the dairy herd to 385 very ordinary milkers, plus replacement young stock. The manager said he intended to improve the quality of the herd by breeding his own replacements from the present cows; a task which has taken many an expert, enthusiastic cattle breeder a lifetime to achieve. He does not have that much time. Meanwhile on the arable side of the farm it was decided to put 30 per cent of the land into set-aside in order to guarantee some income in the form of EC compensation payments. Needless to say the labour force has been cut by almost 80 per cent to 24 people. I judged that to compete with most other EC farmers and produce commodities at community prices it would be necessary for the management to reduce staff again to no more than 12. Overshadowing it all is the fact that the ownership of some of the land being farmed, including that on which the main farm buildings stand, is still in dispute. The manager hopes that the federal government will provide time for this to be sorted out by allowing those who occupy the land to lease it for 12 years. He also hopes that the Treuhand will agree to extend the repayment schedule for loans it made to the Buchholz farming company and continue to forgive interest payments. Altogether these amount to something like Pounds 1m and as the manager admitted the company has still made substantial losses in each of the two years it has been trading. He was convinced that everything would come right and the farm would be showing a profit within two or three years. I did not like to tell him my opinion that without a great deal more financial help from the federal government his company's position was hopeless. And this was said to be one of the better examples of a privatised East German co-operative. United Germany's new agriculture minister, Mr Jochen Borchert, appointed 10 days ago, will understand the problems of former east German agriculture better than most. His father's farm was one of those forcibly merged into a big co-operative in 1953. The family fled to the west at that time taking their young son, Jochen, with them. Since reunification he has successfully reclaimed ownership of the land and is currently renting it to another farming company. So, he will have an intimate knowledge of the strong emotions and enormous financial difficulties involved. But whether it is possible for him to be successful in using that knowledge to find solutions to these most intricate problems that are acceptable to all concerned may be another matter.</p>

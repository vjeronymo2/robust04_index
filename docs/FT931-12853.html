			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Letter: Only the technical innovators can expect to compete Sir, In the report 'Getting ideas to market' (Technology, January 21), the impression is given that Professor John Kay of the London Business School has a jaundiced view of the role of technical innovation in determining commercial success. While this article may not fully represent the views of such a respected and senior economist, my own position at UCL requires me to make the point that technical innovation is of salient importance in business enterprises of all kinds. In the first place, there is massive evidence that only those companies which have learned to harness the power of technical innovation can prosper in a competitive marketplace. Of the older British companies, Pilkington and float-glass technology spring to mind, of course; but also Glaxo which, contrary to a point made in the cited article, rose to global status through its intelligent use of innovation in developing the anti-ulcer drug, Zantac, in competition with the similar and then-dominant drug, Tagamet. And, on a topical note, it is not difficult to believe that most of IBM's recent and well-publicised problems stem from its inability to practise market-led innovation as competently as its competitors. On the other hand, a significant portion of world trade is now conducted by companies of which we had hardly heard 20 years ago. Prime innovators such as Intel, Nintendo, Compaq, Microsoft and Sony have grown rapidly - sometimes to where they dominate their sector - on the basis of a new idea, thoroughly researched, carefully developed, diligently produced and intelligently marketed: or, in short, successfully innovated. It would be possible to go on and on, of course. But I believe that the world and his brother actually know by now that innovation is a 'good thing'. What they may not know is how to practise it effectively, which is the cause to which this embryonic UCL-based foundation is devoted.

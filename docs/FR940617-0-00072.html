			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (a) Nominations for Initial and Subsequent Listings <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed paragraph (a) provided that the Secretary of Agriculture shall cooperate and consult with the Secretary of Interior to devise a similar nomination process for initial listing of significant caves and give public notice of the nomination process. In addition, subsequent determinations of significant caves would be made through the forest planning process. Many respondents felt that the review of nominations and the determination by the authorized officer should be conducted in consultation and cooperation with an advisory committee, team, acknowledged experts in the field of speleology, or appropriate private sector interests, including cavers. A few respondents felt an appeal process was needed for those caves determined not to be significant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This paragraph was revised to focus more narrowly on the nomination process, and a new paragraph (b) was added to describe the evaluation process. The reference in the proposed rule to subsequent determination of significant caves through the forest planning process has been removed. Determination of significant caves can be made at any time by the authorized officer. Reference to consultation between the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior was removed since this coordination has occurred in the writing of the entire rule and through a separate effort to develop a Proposed Procedure for Listing Significant Caves. Both paragraphs emphasize public and agency input and consultation. Notice of the nomination procedures for the initial listing must be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Notice of future listings is not required as the rule provides that the public and government agencies are to submit such nominations to the Forest Supervisor where the cave is located. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (c) Criteria for Significant Caves <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many respondents stated that the criteria were too broad; others felt the criteria were too restrictive. Those respondents who felt the criteria are too broad suggested that criteria be developed at the State-level, be eliminated, or be modified with a strong emphasis on the cave having an important value. The majority of respondents felt that these criteria would eliminate the majority of caves from listing as significant. Most requested that criteria be based only on a cave processing ``one or more of the following features, characteristics, or values.'' Some recommended that the criteria focus on identifying insignificant caves; thus, managing all others as significant. Individual respondents identified the need to add new criteria categories for caves of undetermined status, caves with abnormal dangers, caves with other values, and caves within a special management area which was designated wholly or in part due to the cave resources found there. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, two business entities felt that the criteria for selection of significant caves are too broad and that the proposed rule neglected to consider the impacts that such a designation would have on oil and gas production. They felt that the designation of significant caves needed to be based on caves having an ``important value'', especially when considering other uses of the land. They recommended that significant cave values be weighed against the economic values of mineral development. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act in section 4(a) requires that the Secretary issue criteria for the identification of significant caves in regulations. Thus, criteria focusing on insignificant caves or criteria developed at the State level do not address the Act's mandate. To focus the criteria on an inventory procedure that can be interpreted and more consistently applied across the agency, the qualifier ``*&blank;*&blank;* which are deemed by the authorized officer to be unusual, significant, or otherwise meriting special management'' has not been adopted on the final rule. This phrase confused respondents since it added another level of evaluation and review to the six stated criteria. There is nothing in the Act or its legislative history that indicates that a cave has to have a value more important than, or be weighed against, other uses of public lands before being designated significant. The criteria for designating significant caves are identical to those adopted in the Department of the Interior's final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Biota. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  All respondents commenting on this paragraph requested modifications to make the criteria less restrictive. They recommended the removal of qualifiers such as ``cave dependent,'' ``that occur in large numbers or variety,'' and ``disturbance.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Cave dependent'' was replaced with ``seasonal or yearlong'' to better describe the conditions under which biota use a cave. The qualifier ``*&blank;*&blank;* occur in large numbers or variety *&blank;*&blank;*'' was removed because caves typically contain small populations and variety of flora and fauna by the very nature of the cave environment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cultural. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  All respondents commenting on this paragraph felt the criterion was too restrictive to include potentially eligible sites, religious sites for native Americans, caves mined for saltpeter, and sites with ethnographic or historic associations with events or persons considered important to local communities or social groups. A few suggested eliminating the requirement that the site be eligible for or listed on the National Register or Historic Places. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This paragraph was clarified to address and refer to the terms ``historic or prehistoric'' that are already defined through other laws and regulations. These terms encompass ``cultural'' resources better than historical properties and archaeological resources. The paragraph also was expanded to better describe the types of resources that could be included or eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places based on the cave itself or the contents contained within. The paragraph as revised encompasses religious sites for native Americans, caves mined for saltpeter, and other sites with ethnographic or historic associations. Allowing for a site to be eligible for or listed on the National Register of Historic Places consistently ties to the agency management of cultural resources. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brigadier Jota, spokesman for the Angolan Armed  Forces, told us that the Angolan Air force did not drop napalm  bombs on Huambo. He confirmed the bombing of Huambo and  justified it as an act of retaliation against the Union for the  Total Independence of Angola [UNITA].    [Begin Jota recording] The Angolan Armed Forces are capable  of bombing Huambo at any moment of the day or night but had not  done so until now. On this occasion, they bombed Huambo as an  act of retaliation against UNITA because of what UNITA has been  doing in Bie. [end recording]    That was Brigadier Jota confirming that Huambo has been  bombed but that napalm has not been used.</p>

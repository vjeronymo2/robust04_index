			<p>BFN     [Text] The Henan provincial government delegation headed  by Governor Ma Zhongchen met in Washington, D.C., on 18 May with  Mr. Martin, vice president of the World Bank, and Mr. Browning,  president of the U.S. National Import and Export Bank.    The World Bank, which had previously provided loans to help  Henan build some key projects, recently decided to provide more  loans to Henan. The U.S. National Import and Export Bank has  also decided to provide loans to help Henan purchase several  Boeing 737 planes.    During the meeting, Governor Ma Zhongche spoke highly of the  long-term cooperation between Henan Province and the two banks.  He said: As one of China's communications hubs and bases for  energy and raw materials, Henan boasts more investment  opportunities for the outside world. Bilateral cooperation and  exchanges between Henan and the World Bank and the U.S. National  Import and Export Bank not only coincide with the shared  interests of China and the United States, but also benefit both  countries' economic development.    Governor Ma Zhongchen said he hoped that more U.S.  financiers  and entrepreneurs would come to invest and build factories in  Henan. Mr. Martin pledged to provide more loans to help Henan  build more energy, communications, and infrastructure projects.  Mr. Browning also promised to provide Henan with more loans in  the years ahead to help Henan develop more key projects, large  enterprises, and financial undertakings.    The Henan delegation headed by Governor Ma Zhongchen arrived  in the State of Kansas on the evening of 15 May and was warmly  received by Kansas Governor Benny. During their two-day stay in  Kansas, the delegation visited a number of U.S. enterprises and  companies, held a briefing in the governor's mansion to  introduce Henan's investment opportunities to the Kansas  business community, exchanged views with Kansans from all walks  of life, and briefed Kansas business leaders on Henan's  situation and projects.    At a cocktail party attended by more than 100 people from  Kansas's economic, trade, and industrial circles, Governor Benny  said: Governor Ma Zhongchen's current visit will enhance the  friendly relations of cooperation between Kansas and Henan. Our  bilateral exchanges and cooperation are conducive to our  development and are needed to see continued growth.    Governor Ma Zhongchen said at the cocktail party: I am  looking forward to Governor Benny's visit to Henan. I believe  that as long as both sides join hands and make concerted  efforts, Henan and Kansas will surely be able to push  cooperation onto a new stage.    Both governors expressed the hope that the U.S. and Chinese  entrepreneurs at the cocktail party would contribute to the  continued development of friendly and cooperative relations  between Henan and Kansas. Governor Benny presented Governor Ma  Zhongchen with a Kansas State emblem, while Governor Ma  Zhongchen presented Governor Benny with a box of candies bearing  Governor Benny's portrait and signature. Governor Benny gladly  accepted the gift from Governor Ma Zhongchen and repeatedly  expressed his thanks.    At the cocktail party, industrial, economic, and trade  leaders from Kansas State and Henan Province conscientiously  explored future bilateral cooperation prospects.</p>

			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: D.A. TAKES OVER REFINERY CASE  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County district attorney's office has taken over the  prosecution of two top-ranking officials at Mobil's Torrance refinery on  charges that they contributed to the death of a contract worker and to the  injuries of two others in an explosion July 15, 1988.  </P> <P> The case, brought originally by Torrance City Prosecutor J. D. Lord, also names  three top officials of Cal Cat Chemical Inc. of Benicia.  </P> <P> Lord said he had asked the district attorney's office in late July to prosecute  the case because of new information that could elevate the charges from  misdemeanors to felony manslaughter. Lord said the additional information  surfaced after he filed the case July 15. He declined to elaborate.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Fred Maksoud said his office is taking the case as "an  accommodation" to Lord, but said he could not answer other questions because of  the continuing investigation.  </P> <P> Mobil spokesman Jim Carbonetti said, "The charges are meritless, and we intend  to defend our position rigorously."  </P> <P> The case filed July 15, with 19 misdemeanor counts, names Wyman Robb, Mobil  refinery manager; Tom Gregory, former assistant refinery manager, and the three  Cal Cat Chemical officials. Mobil officials are to be arraigned Monday.  </P> <P> The explosion occurred as Cal Cat Chemical employees were treating sludge from  the bottom of storage tanks containing water contaminated with sulfur  compounds.  </P></p>

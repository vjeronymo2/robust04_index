			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Signals" column by Yunus Hasan al-Samarra'i: "It Is a New </F> War of the Francs"]    [Text] It is a world tyrant. It threw heavenly values  overboard all over the world and then it trampled upon human  rights while falsely bragging about them. It has confirmed its  continued opposition to human rights in Iraq by its stupid  insistence on continuing the unfair and unjust blockade.    This despot behaves like one who refuses to look into the  mirror to avoid seeing his ugly face. The devils are in  Washington and London. They do not even bother to read about  what Iraq has done to fulfill the UN Security Council  resolutions, despite their unfairness.    They are targeting true Islam as expressed by Iraq. They  want to finally liquidate Arabism and pan-Arab hopes in a new  war of the Franks, albeit in a tattered garb.    Whoever reads history will understand the substance of the  policy being pursued by the leaders of the capitalist Western  powers. This is their custom toward the Arab world and Muslims.  The Arab world knew them in the war of the Francs, which the  West called the Crusades, and the invasion of the Arab Levant by  the Knights of St John of Jerusalem following the liquidation of  the Islamic state in Andalusia. Our people knew them in  contemporary history after the Balfour Declaration and the  Sykes-Picot Agreement that divided the Arab homeland among  France, Britain, and Italy, and through the U.S. empire,  represented by U.S. domination of several Arab officials and the  confiscation of their independent decisionmaking, as well as its  complete domination of UN Security Council resolutions.    The United States must understand that no matter how much  they suffer from hunger and the unfairness of U.S.-British  policy, the Iraqis will be with the leader struggler Saddam  Husayn, backing his decision, supporting his stand, upholding  his opinion, and fighting at his behest. This is a fact that  Western leaders must understand. It has been expressed by the  poet who said: Even if they drown it in blood, Iraq will remain  sincere to its Arabism.    Damn U.S.-British policy and its hostile stands against the  Iraqi people! God is great and victory will always be for the  leader of Iraq and his great people.</p>

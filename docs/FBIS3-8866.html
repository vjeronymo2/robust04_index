Speaking to CTK after his meeting with President Michal  Kovac, Dzurinda said he wanted to proceed according to a concept  of the development of the Slovak infrastructure which he had  started before Meciar's government.    "I have received signals that a number of privatization acts  in this field were lately quite strange and I intend to check on  them thoroughly," he said.    "I hold the opinion that a new government should suspend the  privatization decisions the previous cabinet took after February  15 and to check them before proceeding to its own activity in  this field," Dzurinda said.    Asked how he intended to solve the conflict of former  Transport Minister Roman Hofbauer with the Radio Free Europe  (RFE) Dzurinda said that if it became clear that the outgoing  cabinet tried to stop RFE broadcasting in Slovakia then he would  see that it was resumed as soon as possible and the matter  settled so that RFE could broadcast in the future in an  absolutely calm atmosphere.</p>

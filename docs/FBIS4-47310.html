V. Barabin, V. I. Vershinin, V. G. </F> Yelyushkin, L. I. Yablonskiy; UDC 528.711.18:[681.3:516]    [Abstract] Automated terrain analysis requires reliable  detailed information on the spatial position and relative  heights of objects in digital form. Currently, this is done with  photogrammetric processing of stereoscopic large-scale aerial  photographs. This, however, is slow. A computer method of  creating digital terrain models has been developed which uses  individual large-scale space and aerial photographs, digital  topographical maps, or large-scale topographical maps. The  system uses an IBM-AT PC with a half-tone scanner.  Single-exposure, panoramic, and infrared aerospace images may be  used. The article examines the following steps in the process:  preparatory work; photo scanning with a half-tone scanner;  formation of a digital relief matrix; acquisition of the  coordinates of reference points in the coordinate systems of the  photo and the terrain; photographic resection; photo digitizing;  photographic intersection; determination of the relative heights  of objects; and formation of the digital terrain model. The  resultant models are highly accurate, detailed, and reliable.  References 3 (Russian).</p>

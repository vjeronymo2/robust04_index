			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Juan Manuel Alvarado] </F>   [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas -- Using advanced  systems, the Mexican Army's Military Intelligence has been  monitoring the talks between the Zapatist National Liberation  Army [EZLN] and Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis since 21  February. Although the monitoring started on 1 January, it was  increased on 21 February. The Army has continued to intercept  and record EZLN short-wave radio communications in the jungle,  the mountains, and the city.    Communications were intercepted and the exact position of  the  EZLN delegates and Subcommander Marcos at the cathedral during  the peace talks were pinpointed with laser sound-wave emission  and reception systems, high-sensitivity microphones, and a  satellite. Using this same system, Military Intelligence  monitored the EZLN delegates' private conversations, their  plans, and decisions.    A high-ranking Mexican Army officer, who asked to remain  unnamed for security reasons, confirmed these monitoring  actions. "Not even Camacho himself is aware that we know  everything he said. We know everything. What the Zapatists  thought is the only thing we still do not know," he said. The  officer said that Military Intelligence installed a  sound-tracking system using high communications technology  imported from the United States.    With the aid of a map of the Cathedral of Peace and a laser  system, the Army pinpointed the living quarters of the EZLN  delegates and Subcommander Marcos, as well as the dining and  meeting areas. "Sound waves reached us via a laser that was  inside the Cathedral. The laser beam captured sounds, words,  phrases, and entire conversations, and relayed them back to us,"  he said.    During an interview with the officer, he detailed the  Military Intelligence's tracking and monitoring systems. The  Cathedral of Peace was the monitoring target. That is where  negotiations were held beginning on 21 February between Peace  Commissioner Camacho, 18 EZLN delegates, Subcommander Marcos,  and mediator Bishop Samuel Ruiz.    By tracking the Cathedral by satellite, Military  Intelligence  located the living areas, the delegates, Subcommander Marcos, as  well as the security personnel. The officer added that there are  still temporary military "bases" in San Cristobal de las Casas  and the 31st Military Zone. He said there are boards with radio  communication sets, scanners, and telephones at these bases.  Other boards hold laser beam systems, parabolic antennas,  monitoring and reading systems, and microphone recording systems  called "small birds," which read sounds from inside the  Cathedral.    Four Military Intelligence members work 24-hour shifts at  each base. They wear earphones and are in constant  communications with the main base. The information is gathered  with the high-sensitivity systems. The military prepares a daily  report on the conversations monitored and sends it to the 7th  Military Region in Tuxtla Gutierrez. The same report is sent to  National Defense Secretary Antonio Riviera Bazan.    The monitors receive sound waves at the monitoring stations,  the location of which the officer failed to mention. "The  systems currently in use and during the talks include very  sophisticated microphones planted in the outer walls of the  Cathedral of Peace. They are very well concealed. They pick up  information through the walls," he said. "The only way we could  not listen would be if the walls were covered with lead. The  laser beam could not penetrate them then and magnetic waves  could not pass through."    The Mexican Army's actions are carried out clandestinely. A  cease-fire and the suspension of military actions were agreed  upon by the EZLN and the commissioner to begin the negotiations.  <H5>  Espionage Activities </H5>   In addition to espionage activities aimed at taping private  conversations and negotiations between the delegates and  Subcommander Marcos, they also scan EZLN communications in the  jungle and mountains and from there to the Zapatist  communications center in San Cristobal de las Casas.    Even before 1 January, the EZLN had been using a short-wave  radio system of clandestine radio communications. Military  Intelligence intercepted these EZLN classified conversations.  They currently have a file with cassettes including  conversations revealing their codes, locations, and activities.  EL NORTE was able to obtain some of the cassettes taped by the  military. Officially, these activities "do not take place", just  like these cassettes "do not exist." The cassettes procured by  EL NORTE were forwarded, along with others, to the 7th Military  Region. Each of the cassettes are numbered and carry the date  when they were taped. Approximately three cassettes carrying  Zapatist conversations are taped daily.  <H5>  Taped Messages </H5>   Some of the taped messages say: "Copy... we must go to the  watch tower... pending the saints and check on the men with the  large hats" [Copiado ... hay que ir al mirador... pendiente de  los santos y checar a los sombrerudos]. Some of the cassettes  examined by EL NORTE's correspondent includes several codes  indicating the names of bases, leaders, and information  exchanges as well as cattle rustling activities and even the 18  February arrangements to transport the Zapatist delegates to the  cathedral. Most of the messages are either in tzeltal or tzotzil  [Indian dialects], with a few in Spanish.    Some of the conversations taped include events like the  CNDH's [National Human Rights Committee] visit to several  Zapatist regions, the presence of reporters, and some EZLN  activities. There are also talks on changing clandestine  communications channels and cattle rustling activities.    These are some EZLN conversations taped by Military  Intelligence and transcribed by EL NORTE:    1. "They were beaten up or something like that, over. I  am being asked if they can go ahead with the preparation of the  record even if it is for its sake, over...    2. Affirmative, but together with the CNDH.    1. Copy...    2. Together with a copy, and send that bastard with the  milk because they left and the only thing you know about is the  presence of the federales.    1. Send the big ears over there. If possible, try to  brand them. At the house of the big hats, there are cots,  refrigerators. Take all you need since you can use them. I do  not know how many can come over here either.    2. I do not know, copy.    1. Come on Thursday. Well, if you can make it on Friday,  it is to stay.    2. Buffalo says to go to crab [cangrejo]. They had the  contract. We were the only ones to fail, but he knows why. I am  going to send someone to represent me. You are going to have a  talk with the contractor and he is going to tell you what he  needs.    2. Copy.    1. If you know that the number of the base, try to get it  out of him.    2. If you are hungry just get a hold of a big ears. There  are salt bags there, use them.    Codes -- big ears mean cattle, buffalo is the EZLN leader,  Zapatist soldiers are known as workers, and maseca which means  base -- are part of the communications system. According to the  taped conversations, the Zapatist bases are identified by names  of saints and EZLN operations are coordinated by contractors.  <H5>  Marcos: We Were Already Aware </H5>   At one of the EZLN camps located in the jungle, Subcommander  Marcos pointed out that they were already aware of Military  Intelligence surveillance. "We knew we were being taped and  spied on during the dialogue and that is why we took some  precautions. We, as well as the mediator, were aware they were  taping our conversations and everything else we said in private  with the commissioner," the subcommander said. "We are also  aware that intercepting our communications right now is contrary  to the cease-fire and contrary to what they say is a search for  peace." As a result of the eavesdropping, the subcommander  indicated that they began to modify their codes as well as  taking other measures.</p>

			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / A Duchy at the heart of Europe 'We get on well with everyone,' said a Luxembourg hat-shop owner, in one of the narrow, sandy-coloured stone streets that run steeply downhill from the city's main square. 'We are the very best Europeans.' On Saturday, the morning after Mr Jacques Santer, the Luxembourg prime minister, had been chosen to replace Mr Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission, it was difficult to find Luxembourgers in the Grand Duchy. The woman serving in a coffee shop in the city centre was Belgian. 'You won't find any Luxembourgers round here,' she confidently predicted. 'You have to go to the country to find a pure Luxembourger.' The man behind a stall in the fruit market was from Portugal. 'We're all European now, anyway,' he said grumpily. Two elderly ladies daintily eating fruit salad in the shade of a tree were Dutch. Each day, thousands of commuters travel to the Grand Duchy to work in banks, insurance companies, bars and restaurants, the result being a polyglot nation where some 30 per cent of the 400,000-strong population and half the workforce is foreign. Luxembourg's location - boxed in by France, Belgium and Germany - means that the citizens are tri-lingual, speaking French, German and the local language, Letzebuergesch. A German dialect heavily laced with French, it has recently been designated the official language, although government business is still mainly carried out in French. 'There's no point asking what Luxembourgers think about something, because there is virtually no such thing as a real Luxembourger any more,' said a barman of French and Luxembourger origin, who carried a Luxembourg passport. 'There is nothing here to feel really proud of, but it's a nice, convenient place to come from,' he adds, with a modesty indicative of the country.</p>

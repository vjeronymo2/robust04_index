			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Hematocrit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Currently no standard exists in the FAA regulations for blood hematocrit. The AMA Report recommends that all applicants at age 40, and periodically thereafter, demonstrate a hematocrit within the range of 32 to 55 percent. The requirement is recommended because the ability of blood to transport oxygen effectively to tissues is dependent on adequate hemoglobin concentration and on the ability of blood to perfuse organs. Abnormalities of this function can result in incapacitating organ infarcts. Also, a number of significant medical conditions are often reflected in abnormalities of the blood. Anemias of various etiology, organ malignancies, polycythemia, lung disease, hemoglobinopathies, coagulation and thrombotic disorders, hematologic neoplasia, lymphomas, immunodeficiency syndromes, and other disorders are included in the conditions that may be discovered through examination of the blood.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA is not proposing to add new standards for blood hematocrit testing at this time. Hematocrit testing would impose incremental costs on applicants for a first-class airman medical certificate and additional administrative costs on the FAA. While the recommendations of the AMA Report suggest that hematocrit testing would result in detection of certain adverse or potentially incapacitating medical conditions, the risk to flight safety appears minimal in comparison to the cost of testing. The list of specific conditions that would disqualify a person is not proposed for inclusion in the FAR because the conditions are already covered in the general medical standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Anticoagulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Current regulations do not contain specific standards for anticoagulation. Under the general rules of current paragraphs (f)(2) (i) and (ii) of &sect;&sect;67.13, 67.15, and 67.17, the FAA has denied routine certification of persons who require medication for anticoagulation. The FAA does, however, grant special issuance to a limited number of airmen who use this type of medication after extensive evaluations of the conditions requiring anticoagulation, the stability of the airmen's treatment regimens, and the presence or absence of adverse side-effects. Periodic reevaluation always is required for subsequent certification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The AMA Report recommends denial of routine medical certification for any person who uses an anticoagulant medication. This recommendation is consistent with earlier medical reports such as the report of the Eighth Bethesda Conference of the American College of Cardiology in 1975, the Report of a Working Party of the Cardiology Committee of the Royal College of Physicians of London in 1978, The First United Kingdom Workshop in Aviation Cardiology in 1982, and The Second United Kingdom Workshop in Aviation Cardiology in 1987, and with recommendations of some FAA medical consultants. Based on its experience with airmen who are taking anticoagulant medication, the FAA believes that some individuals who receive anticoagulant medications may be granted airman medical certification after careful evaluation of their specific condition. Such certification represents an exception, however, and must be accomplished under the special issuance provisions of the FAR, subject to appropriate, periodic medical reevaluation and possible restrictions. To clarify this position and to meet the FAA's statutory responsibility to ensure public safety, the FAA proposes (proposed &sect;67.111(c)) to add the use of anticoagulant medication to those conditions specified in the FAR as disqualifying an individual for certification. (Discussion of how a proposed disqualifying condition may affect a current medical certificate appears under ``Additional Standards for Disqualification.'')  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Respiratory System  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Current regulations do not contain specific standards pertaining to the respiratory system. The Respiratory System Committee, in its section of the AMA Report, recommended that all airmen older than 40 years periodically demonstrate the absence of severe lung disease through spirometry, a simple, non-invasive test available in the physician's office. The committee stated its concerns for the danger to public safety represented by airmen with serious pulmonary disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, infectious diseases of the lung, hypoventilation syndromes, chronic interstitial lung disease, and disorders of the respiratory muscles and bony thorax. Both judgment and the ability to perform complex tasks may be affected adversely by a reduction of oxygen available to the brain (hypoxia) because of poor pulmonary function, and acute lung disease can cause hypoxia without warning. Altitude itself affects pulmonary function, so careful assessment of pulmonary status is required to prevent incapacitation during flight, according to the committee's report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

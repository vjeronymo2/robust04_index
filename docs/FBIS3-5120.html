The analyst says:    Recently, former Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone  claimed that if the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  refused to accept a "special inspection," the United Nations  Security Council must not rule out possibilities of "economic  sanctions." Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata urged the  DPRK to take "steps to remove the suspicion of nuclear arms  development," saying that "pressure for an inspection of the  DPRK's military sites" would increase.    Such remarks can be made only by wicked fellows. Japan has  no justification to poke its nose into the nuclear issue on the  Korean peninsula.    The way for the solution to the nuclear issue through the  DPRK-U.S. talks is now open.    The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula can be resolved  only by the DPRK and the United States.    The recently published conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S.  contact in New York includes no word of "special inspection."    Nevertheless, the Japanese reactionaries are impudently  crying for a "special inspection" and "sanctions" by the United  Nations Security Council. This is nothing but a move to impede  the progress of the DPRK-U.S. talks at any cost by admonishing  the United States and putting pressure on it.    This is aimed at stifling the DPRK by setting in motion even  the UN Security Council.    While slandering the DPRK, the Japanese reactionaries are  also seeking to find a pretext for Japan's nuclear armament.  Japan intends to use the DPRK's "nuclear issue" as a playing  card for stepping up its nuclear armament and soothing the  worldwide concern over it.    Such a foolish act of Japan, however, cannot work.    We cannot but keep heightened vigilance in coping with the  strained situation created by the full-scale acceleration of the  nuclear armament of Japan.</p>

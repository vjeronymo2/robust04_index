			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Outsource boom for in-house services British Aerospace does it. So does the Inland Revenue. And most companies in the UK have either tried it, liked it or want to do it more. In the last five years, outsourcing - the practice of contracting out services previously done in-house - has become well established in British companies. A survey of the country's largest public companies, by 3i, the investment capital provider, suggests overwhelming support for outsourcing and 80 per cent of those surveyed said there was scope for more. The survey suggests that the smaller companies which often supply the services are likely to do significantly more non-core activities for the larger companies. Most companies said the greatest benefit was the management time that was freed up, but also noted that outsourcing cut staff costs and increased flexibility. Nearly half those surveyed said it also helped create greater certainty about the level of costs. The greatest problem was maintaining the quality of service and communications with the sub-contractors. The most common service to be outsourced was, not unexpectedly, printing, where three-quarters of companies have now stopped doing it themselves. Travel services and pension management were almost as popular. More than half those surveyed had outsourced software developments, public relations functions and catering. At the other end of the scale, 1 per cent had outsourced the accounting function, 5 per cent treasury management and 7 per cent research and development. Most outsourcing was the result of decisions taken on an ad hoc basis, suggesting the practice could spread still further. Three-quarters of the companies had not conducted a systematic review of the opportunities. But two-thirds said they expected a further reduction in the number of middle managers and believed new employment opportunities would appear in the small and medium-sized sector of business. 'Small companies can do the work more efficiently and cheaply and in many instances do it better,' said Rupert Wiles, director of 3i. Survey available from 3i - 071 928 3131</p>

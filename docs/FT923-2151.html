			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Letter: Mr Jonathan Hoffman The final sentence of Mr Jonathan Hoffman's letter yesterday should have read: 'That is why the ERM has no choice but to go forwards to Emu, or backwards to more frequent realignments; the present state of limbo is completely unsustainable.' By omitting the words 'or backwards' we incorrectly suggested that his view was that the only way forwards was to realignments rather than to monetary union.</p>

			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> OPERATORS PLUG IN INFORMATION  </P> <P> In name only, Directory Assistance is no more at Michigan Bell.  </P> <P> Call it Information, please.  </P> <P> That's what most people call it anyway. Now, Michigan Bell is changing the name  of its service from Directory Assistance to Information. The service goes  beyond giving out telephone numbers, to offering area code information or  emergency numbers, Michigan Bell said.  </P> <P> When the service began shortly after the turn of the century, it was called  Information. In 1967, it was changed to Directory Assistance. In 1971, the name  was changed to New Number Information. A decade later, it returned to Directory  Assistance.  </P> <P> The return to Information completes the circle, Eileen Dixon, a Michigan Bell  spokeswoman, said.  </P></p>

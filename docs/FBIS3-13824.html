			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] His Majesty King Husayn has blamed the absence of  Arab coordination for the U.S. abstention on the Jerusalem item  vote that figured in the UN Security Council Resolution 904 on  the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. His majesty also faulted the  Arab handling of the issue and Arab approaches to the draft  resolution and the Hebron tragedy. His majesty indicated that  Jerusalem need not have figured in the resolution. Instead a  reference might have been made to the Geneva Convention, which  stipulates protection for the Palestinians under occupation.    In an interviewed with the French news agency today, his  majesty said: We may be better off as a result of the  resolution and the United States abstention, which one may  interpret as a shift in Washinton's position on Arab demands and  claims on Jerusalem. [sentence as heard] His Majesty King  Husayn wondered whether or not this signals a change. He  indicated that he will call on the United States to spell out  its stand, since one cannot say for sure that there has been a  change in the U.S. position. We need to receive assurance that  the U.S. policy on Jerusalem has not changed as happened in the  past when Washington viewed the settlements as being illegal to  begin with and later as an obstacle in the path of the peace  process.    His majesty warned of the detrimental implication of the  lack  of Arab coordination for Arab interests, particularly on  delicate issues and in hard times. He majesty indicated that  the Arabs have not been able to work out a serious position on a  comprehensive, just, and lasting settlement acceptable to future  generations. He said that as things stand now, there is no room  for optimism because Israel presents a solid, single front and  we are split into several fronts.    His Majesty King Husayn said: We were surprised by the  wording of the Security Council resolution that was the outcome  of contacts involving the Palestinians, the Americans, and other  parties, not including ourselves. His majesty said he tried to  do the impossible at the eleventh hour before the resolution was  passed by contacting a number of Arab leaders to achieve a  semblance of Arab coordination. The aim, his majesty explained,  was to minimize the chances of a veto or an abstention,  particularly by the United States. As an occupying power,  Israel, his majety said, is responsible for a string of crimes,  including the arson attack at al-Aqsa Mosque in 1969, violations  of Christian holy places, and the latest al-Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre. His majesty asked whether Israel has done its duty in  the way of protection for the sacred places.    His majesty said he will travel to the sultanate of Oman  tomorrow and from there proceed to visit Qatar for consultations  and coordination with their leaders.</p>

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Unit trusts call truce in high income war Full scale war in the unit trust industry was averted yesterday, when rival parties Save &amp; Prosper and an alliance of Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial and Morgan Grenfell agreed to differ on the issue of high income unit trusts. Hostilities seemed set to break out over the weekend when Save &amp; Prosper abandoned plans to launch a trust offering a 10 per cent yield, citing doubts that such a return would have been achieved without erosion of capital. That implicitly raised doubts about the backing for funds run by Hypo F &amp; C and Morgan Grenfell, which between them have raised Pounds 490m from investors. Save &amp; Prosper had arranged meetings to brief journalists on Wednesday; Hypo F &amp; C had also organised to meet the press in order to respond. Instead, the two sides decided to talk and the press briefings were hurriedly cancelled. Yesterday, each side issued a statement with the aim of defusing the row. At the heart of the issue is the use of options to generate income. Both the Hypo F &amp; C and the Morgan Grenfell funds use a combination of shares, cash and options to achieve their 10 per cent yield. The funds earn premiums by writing call options against the shares they own - in non-jargon terms, that means they give other investors the right to buy the shares at a certain price. While the premiums can be passed through to investors as income the funds miss out on some capital growth, since the options will be exercised if share prices rise. What is less clear is whether the above strategy is likely to lead to the erosion of investor's capital. In its statement yesterday, Save &amp; Prosper said 'it felt that it could not launch such a unit trust if it had doubts about the trust's ability to pay a 10 per cent income on a continuing basis without there being the probability of erosion of capital built into the portfolio structure.' However, S&amp;P added 'there are a number of different approaches to derivatives investment and it will not comment on the validity or efficiency of any existing unit trust or offshore fund.' For their part, Hypo F &amp; C and Morgan Grenfell issued a joint statement, which said 'The two companies are confident of their funds' abilities to meet their stated objectives. Based on the discussions with Save &amp; Prosper, we believe that there are significant features of the two companies' funds which have not been explored by the models used.</p>

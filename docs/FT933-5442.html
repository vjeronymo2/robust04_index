			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Salaries 'less important' THE INCOME of the average family increasingly depends less on full-time salaried employment and more on a variety of other private and government sources, the survey says. In the past 20 years wages and salaries have fallen from more than three-quarters to less than two-thirds of total family income, while income from self-employment has grown from 6.2 per cent to 8.6 per cent of the total. Self-employment is most common in the most affluent households. In more than 16 per cent of the sample of families with weekly gross incomes exceeding Pounds 800, the head of household was self-employed. The importance of investment income has more than doubled in the past 20 years to 6 per cent of the total. The CSO says this is due partly to the spread of share ownership. The trend also reflects an ageing population. A quarter of all households surveyed consisted of retired people, and 5.7 per of total income was pensions and annuities - more than double the proportion 20 years ago. Although the contribution from social security, at 13.1 per cent, was higher than in 1972, it is slightly lower than a decade ago.</p>

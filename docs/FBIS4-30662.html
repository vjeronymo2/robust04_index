			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Romie A. Evangelista] </F>   [Text] The Philippine National Police [PNP] has created a  special unit which assist the Department of Environment and  Natural Resources (DENR) in implementing environment protection  laws.    Outgoing Philippine National Police chief, Director General  Umberto Rodriguez, said the new police unit called by PNP  Environment and Natural Resources Protection Force (ENRPF), to  be known as the PNP Green Army, shall be composed of selected  men from the PNP Regional Mobile Force and will be backed by  local units from PNP Traffic Management Command, the PNP  Maritime Command, the Police Aviation Security Command,  Philippine Coast Guard and the local police units.    The PNP chief issued last 25 May Letter of Instruction 17/94  dubbed as "Oplan Kalikasan [Nature Operation Plan]" aimed at  assisting the DENR in implementing ecology protection laws.    ENRPF teams were specifically tasked to conduct crackdown on  illegal logging, illegal fishing and coral collection, poaching  by foreign fishermen, the campaign against smoke-belching  vehicles in urban centers.    The ENRPF will closely coordinate with the intelligence  units  of the Department of Agriculture, DENR and Coast Guard and  concerned non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to apprehend  violators.    Regional directors who were given authority to decide how  many members the local ENRPF, will also have direct command and  supervision of the local ENRPF units. [sentence as published]    All items seized from arrested suspects will be turned over  to concerned government agencies that will also handle the  investigation and filing of appropriate charges.    Early this year, the PNP, on orders of the president,  deployed a company of SAF [expansion unknown] troops in Lanao  del Sur to guard against illegal logging operations in the Lake  Lanao watershed area.</p>

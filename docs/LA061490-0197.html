			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRAILER OFFERING HOMELESS AID IS PARKED IN HOLLYWOOD UNTIL JULY 6  </P> <P> A city-funded mobile trailer that takes a variety of government and private  services to the homeless has set up shop in Hollywood.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Mobile Ombudsman Program, which ferries a group of care  providers around the city in a trailer, will be at 4759 Hollywood Blvd., in a  parking lot behind the Hollywood Mental Health Program until July 6, when it  will move to another location.  </P> <P> In the trailer, a mix of federal, state and local officials and private care  providers try to link the homeless with a wide range of services they might  need, such as access to veterans benefits, employment development and Social  Security funds, legal services, health and mental health care, and drug abuse  and AIDS counseling.  </P> <P> The ombudsman program, using $110,000 in city funds, tries to nudge the  homeless off the streets by finding them aid and programs that can help them  get their lives back in order and find jobs and housing, according to Patricia  Huff, a senior management analyst for the Community Development Department who  coordinates the program.  </P> <P> "We basically have every social service that is needed right inside the trailer  and we bring it directly to the homeless instead of waiting for them to come to  us," Huff said.  </P> <P> "We can expedite services, so they don't have to wait in welfare lines, and, in  fact, can reasonably walk away with shelter and food stamps in one visit," Huff  said. "It is like one-stop shopping."  </P> <P> The staff of about 10 employees and some volunteers greets the men and women  that come to the trailer and guides them through the otherwise tedious and  confusing process of traveling from aid office to office and line to line to  determine what services they need, what they are eligible for and where they  can obtain help.  </P> <P> Program employees use city vans to shuttle the homeless to and from the trailer  to job interviews, welfare appointments, hospital appointments and other  errands, and to take homeless people to the trailer itself for aid.  </P> <P> "It deals with one of the most obvious social problems in Hollywood," said City  Councilman Michael Woo, who represents Hollywood, an area frequented by  transients and the homeless.  </P> <P> "It is a great example of getting bureaucracies to work together, and for those  (homeless) willing to help themselves, it is a real godsend."  </P> <P> The trailer has served the homeless in Venice, Wilmington, Van Nuys and other  sites.  </P></p>

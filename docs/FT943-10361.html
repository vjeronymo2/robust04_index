			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Observer: Pooling resources Shenzhen, one of China's leading showcases of economic reform, has a pressing problem - a serious lack of public lavatories. With only 31 public conveniences in 327.5 sq km of the 'special economic zone', visitors are feeling the squeeze, so to speak. They are better off in Beijing, which boasts on average four more public loos per sq km. Help is at hand, partly stimulated by a sympathetic China News Agency report, which passionately pleaded that 'tourists in Shenzhen, especially the very desperate, cannot help but burst into hotels and restaurants, where they are looked on with disdain'. Relief beckons. For Shenzhen is to build 15 new public toilets, at a total cost of 6.6m yuan - the equivalent of Dollars 51,163 each. Wonder what the internal rate of return is?</p>

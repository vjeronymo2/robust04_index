			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Leading Article: A private nuclear future The review of the nuclear power industry which the UK government has been conducting over the past four months has thrown up many complex and emotional issues. But they can all be boiled down to two basic questions. Does the UK need to build any more nuclear power stations? Should the nuclear power generation industry be privatised? Of these, the second is much the more important. From the nuclear industry's point of view, this is a good moment to address both questions. The two state-owned companies, Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear have made impressive progress towards overcoming the profligacy and misjudgments of the past. They now account for a quarter of the electricity consumed in Britain, and they can produce it at a price which is beginning to approach open market levels. The near-completion of Sizewell B also suggests that the industry's technical abilities are alive and well. At a time when the government is committed to reducing atmospheric pollution, nuclear can also put up a legitimate environmental case that it is 'cleaner' than fossil fuel plants. On the other hand, Britain has a growing surplus of power generation capacity, and though the nuclear component of that will shrink as first generation Magnox reactors are phased out, there should be no automatic presumption that they will be replaced with further nuclear plant. Decommissioning cost Another complication is the radioactive waste from nuclear power stations, and the cost of decommissioning them when they reach the end of their lives. Neither of the two state-owned companies is fully provisioned for these costs: their liabilities are being covered partly by subsidies from the electricity market, partly by the taxpayer. Although there is a prospect that the newer power stations will be able to provision themselves, this may never be the case with the old Magnox stations whose economics are so doubtful that they will have to remain in government hands whatever happens to the rest of the business. On the face of it, the case for privatisation is thus not strong. In its present shape, the industry is not capable of operating commercially because of its huge inherited liabilities and operating costs. The financial markets remain deeply sceptical about the risks of nuclear power. But all this should not deter the government from exploring ways of reshaping the industry into a form that could become fully commercial. The managements of both state-owned companies are keen to be privatised, and have put forward detailed cases in support of their ambitions. Investor credibility The main aim of the review should be to identify those parts of the generation companies which are capable of standing on their own feet and creating out of them businesses that would have credibility with investors. This would include the more efficient AGR stations and Sizewell B. And it is through the privatisation of the business rather than by government diktat that the future of nuclear power must be decided. Making privatisation work will depend on resolving two problems that affect the commercial viability of nuclear power. First, failure to align prices with wider social costs and benefits can lead to distorted outcomes. Thus if nuclear plant is required to bear the full environmental costs including those of decommissioning and spent fuel storage, the same must apply to other forms of electricity generation. Otherwise competition would not be equal. Second, nuclear power faces unique political risks against which no private operator could hope to insure itself. This problem needs to be addressed by government if a privatised industry is to invest in efficient new generating capacity. Provided these problems are solved, privatisation would be appropriate and should be workable. The management of these companies would be best placed to decide whether further development of nuclear power was viable. The truth is that there is no special case for nuclear power, any more than there was for coal. But if the managers of the industry want to go private, and investors are prepared to back them, they should be given the chance.</p>

			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / International Company News: Trygg-Hansa plunges to SKr5.5bn loss at 8 months TRYGG-HANSA SPP, Sweden's leading insurance group, plunged into a SKr5.57bn (Dollars 1.04bn) loss for the first eight months of the year. This compares with a SKr1.09bn profit for the same period of 1991. The main reason for the dramatic deterioration is the huge estimated loss of SKr6.01bn due to its major holdings in Gota AB, the Swedish holding company, Svenska Kredit, the leading private export credit company, and IC Holding, the credit company, all of which are in liquidation. The group was also hit by the fall in share prices and property values. The losses suffered from the group's involvement in Gota are estimated to be SKr5.51bn. Earlier this week the group appointed a receiver and went into liquidation. The insurance company's association with Gota has turned out to be an unhappy one since it became its major shareholder as a result of the merger in November 1990 between Trygg-Hansa and the SPP pension insurance group. In April this year Trygg-Hansa SPP made a SKr1.4bn bid to buy the whole of Gota AB. Mr Bjorn Sprangare, chief executive of Trygg-Hansa SPP, said last night that while the group's shareholders would be hit by the heavy losses incurred in the first eight months, they would not affect insurance policy holders. 'Despite this considerable loss the holding company has a powerful economic position', he added. 'The company is stronger than any other insurance company in Sweden'. For the first eight months Trygg Hansa SPP's insurance operations performed positively, with a SKr333m operating profit, though this was a 41 per cent drop from the SKr562m profit made over the same period of 1991. Premiums earned totalled SKr5.06bn for the January-August period, which was a 4 per cent improvement on January-August period of 1991. Trygg-Hansa SPP also saw growth in its operating income from the Home Holdings group in the US, in which it has a 33.3 per cent stake. For the first six months of the year profits rose to SKr95m from SKr12m for the same period of last year. However, the company suffered a 60 per cent per cent drop to SKr437m in its operating profit for all the group's activities, compared with a SKr1.09bn profit for the same period of last year. The decline was blamed on the dramatic fall in share values and property prices that have hit Trygg-Hansa SPP's investment portfolio hard so far this year. The group showed a negative equity/assets ratio compared with 15 per cent for the first eight months of last year and it recorded a loss of SKr58.90 per share, compared with a gain of SKr11.60 for the same period of 1991.</p>

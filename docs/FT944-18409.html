			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Ayrshire pylons inquiry opens The plan to run a line of pylons across south Ayrshire to take power from Scotland to Northern Ireland is to be considered at a public inquiry which opens in Ayr today and is likely to last more than two months. The 40-mile line of pylons is part of a proposed Pounds 175m scheme for ScottishPower to supply Northern Ireland Electricity with 250MW of power. The European Union has promised a grant of Pounds 61m and ScottishPower will invest Pounds 20m. The project has attracted strong opposition in Ayrshire from a campaign group which says the pylons will ruin some of the finest scenery in Scotland, pose a health hazard and damage the local economy. Northern Ireland Electricity says the scheme is the best solution for meeting its expected power shortfall after 1997. Scottish Power sees the project as a way of increasing output and maximising the use of its coal-burning power stations. The scheme would involve building more than 200 pylons from a site near Ayr to Ballantrae in south-west Ayrshire. Kyle and Carrick district council, across which the pylons would run, is one the leading objectors. However, a consultants' report commissioned by the council said the project would bring substantial benefits to Scotland.</p>

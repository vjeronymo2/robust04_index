			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial by Bo Stenstrom: "Well, No, She Doesn't Know Yet"] </F>   [Text] The Trade and Industry Delegation's recent public  opinion poll on the EU [European Union] is more interesting than  news reports have indicated, notes Bo Stenstrom.    It is certainly interesting that attitudes toward the EU  have  scarcely changed since late last fall. According to the poll  conducted by the Trade and Industry Delegation (EVA in Finnish)  to ascertain our opinions on the EU, the number of supporters  has risen from 39 to 40 percent. That change is within the  margin of error.    The decline on the no side from 41 to 37 percent is clearer.  Most of that 4 percent wound up in the undecided column. A full  29 percent of the women in this poll are undecided. That is the  afterglow of the rush to fence-sitting that was caused by the  Rehn phenomenon and that has been measured in other polls since  January.    Little has changed in people's opinions of the EU over the  past year -- despite the fact that during that time we  negotiated an EU agreement, despite the attack on the White  House in Moscow, despite the Russian election results, despite  the fact that the EEA [European Economic Area] has come into  being, and despite the fact that we have gotten a GATT agreement.    It is still the case that only 16 percent are absolutely and  completely certain that they will vote yes on the EU, while 20  percent are equally certain that they will vote no. The  undecided group has grown from 20 to 23 percent. The minor  changes since last fall mean that a very slim majority of no  votes has turned into a somewhat clearer majority of yes votes.  But ordinary people have nevertheless gotten the impression that  there has been a rush to the yes side.    No such rush has occurred, but the EVA's surveys, which  follow the same pattern as the European barometers, provide a  great deal of interesting material under their calm surface.    It is still the case that only a minority is ready to throw  neutrality overboard as being unnecessary, and the Zhirinovskiy  factor is not as clear-cut as foreign visitors are often told.  It is true that 54 percent think we would be safer in the EU in  the face of an unstable Russia, but that does not constitute a  dramatic change.    That is good. We cannot claim that we are joining the EU  and,  for example, Partnership for Peace with no intention of gaining  security guarantees -- because we do not feel threatened --  while at the same time joking (?!) with visitors that we ought  to get Zhirinovskiy to threaten us before the referendum. Such a  statement has been made.    A striking change has occurred in the way voters between the  ages of 18 and 25 feel about the EU. Their attitude is now  unfavorable (35 percent for and 38 percent against). Maybe this  means we can avoid the populism that both finalists in the  presidential election and spokesmen for industry have flirted  with in their talk about lowering the voting age to 16 in time  for the referendum.    Since the youngest voters have been more favorable to the EU  than their grandparents until now, it has been said that those  who are going to live the longest within the EU ought to have  more to say about it. On the other hand, what this means is that  the generations that defended the country and brought those  children into the world are too senile to realize what is good  for the country and take responsibility for what is best for  their children and grandchildren.    There is no minimum age limit for those who want to  influence  the decision through, for example, the pages of  HUFVUDSTADSBLADET, but the voting age itself is fine the way it  is. If it is lowered, participation in elections will also  decline, and what we are talking about here is not just opinions  but also experience in life and citizenship.    Most women are opposed to the EU (34 percent in favor, 38  percent opposed). In their case, concern over social protection  plays an important role. Women are not so unaware that they do  not know that social policy is still a national matter within  the EU. On the other hand, it may be hard for Finland to  maintain a different and more expensive model here on the  periphery than that adopted by those at the center of the EU.  Women need only listen to the insidious ideological values being  presented under cover of the EU.    To be sure of a yes vote, it will soon be necessary to  restrict voting eligibility to middle-aged male university  graduates who live in Uusimaa, belong to the Conservative Party,  and have good incomes and jobs in leading positions.    The Center Party's dilemma is illustrated by the fact that  opponents lead by 58 to 22 percent, but the situation is not  easy for the Social Democrats, either, even though the yes side  has grown, with the score now standing at 51 to 27 percent. In  the SAK [Finnish Confederation of Trade Unions], opinion is  almost evenly divided at 36 percent for and 39 percent against.    This means that an untimely election at the same time as a  referendum will involve a risk both for the yes side and for the  Social Democratic Party.    A full 21 percent of those polled link Finland's membership  with that of the Nordic region. This means another risk if that  group, which knows it is deliberately being denied maximum  insight into the election situation, is forced to the ballot box  as bait for brother countries when the opposition there is  presumably stronger than just before election day. Why would one  not let oneself be influenced by them?    There are also other uncertain factors. There is a  misconception that it would be possible to learn everything one  needed to know if there were adequate information.    It is possible to gain a reasonable understanding of the  EU's  various aspects today and even of the role assigned to Finland  by the EU agreement. But how the EU will affect us in the long  run, what the EU will develop into, and what external (military  or economic) factors will give rise to -- that is a different  matter.    We must make that judgment and accept responsibility for it  so that strong special interests will not decide the matter to  their own advantage, and then we must also accept responsibility  for the losing side, regardless of which side that is.</p>

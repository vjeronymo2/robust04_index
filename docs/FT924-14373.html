			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Miyazawa tries to lift confidence JAPAN'S leaders yesterday tried to bolster fragile business confidence by declaring that about 70 per cent of the Y10,700bn (Pounds 50bn) emergency package announced in August was ready to be implemented. However, Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, warned that the economy was still weakening, while Mr Michio Watanabe, international trade and industry minister, said the economy would start to regain its strength next summer. The government is concerned that the initial euphoria which buoyed the stock market after the August announcement may be wearing off. Business leaders this week raised doubts about whether the huge programme of public works in the package could be implemented by next March, the end of the fiscal year. Despite the scale of the public effort to support the economy, the government is under increasing pressure from within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party as well as outside it, to consider a further fiscal stimulus in the 1993 budget. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, said steady progress was being made in implementing the plan. Public money is pouring into the Japanese economy through a variety of channels, many of them not obvious. Public works worth about Y3,900bn are to be implemented sooner than planned. The Fiscal Investment and Loan Programme, which has deposits of more than Y32,000bn had already invested an additional Y800bn in the public sector Housing Loan Corporation, helping to stimulate house construction. The cabinet yesterday lowered the interest rate on those loans. About Y300bn has been provided for public corporations such as the Japan Highway Public Corporation and the Housing and Urban Development Corporation. Local government budgets have been increased substantially to meet their target of Y1,800bn extra spending. The supplementary budget for the 47 prefectural governments has been increased to Y812.9bn, more than twice the previous record high of Y357.5bn last year.</p>

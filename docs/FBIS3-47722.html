			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chit Estrella and Eric Loretizo] </F>   [Text] Exiled communist leader Jose Maria Sison yesterday  branded the capture of Arturo Tabara, a former ranking communist  party official, as a fake and reiterated the charge that the  latter had turned military agent a long time ago.    In faxed message where he reacted to reports that the  military had arrested Tabara and four other dissidents, Sison  said, "The so called capture of Arturo Tabara is not a real  capture because he has been a military asset since 1988, the  year his wife was arrested and released upon Tabara's agreement  to cooperate with the ISAFP (Intelligence Service of the AFP  [Armed Forces of the Philippines]).    Sison, however, said it was possible the four others were  truly captured by the military and were trapped into being so by  Tabara.    "There are strong indications that Tabara surrendered his  henchmen to the enemy. They were supposedly armed and yet did  not offer any resistance," the CPP [Communist Party of the  Philippines] founder said.    Because he believes the capture was merely staged, Sison  said  he would not be surprised if Tabara is soon released.    Moreover, "we should not be surprised if Tabara and his  henchmen shall continue to speak and act as counterrevolutionary  agents of the U.S.-Ramos regime and are given all the  opportunities to do so while they are supposed to be in military  custody," he said.    Tabara was one of four former CPP officials expelled from  the  party late last year. They were opposed to the leadership of  Sison and have been identified as leaders of the "rejectionists"  faction in the underground leftist movement.    In an interview after his capture, Tabara dared Sison to  come  home and lead the rebellion himself.    He called Sison a megalomaniac and discounted the  possibility  of a reunification with Sison's group. Tabara added that his  group is forming a new "proletarian people's party" with armed  struggle and political work as the basis of their existence.    Meanwhile, former Ambassador Howard Dee, head of the  government panel negotiating with the communist groups yesterday  admitted that he is getting impatient with the "dilly dallying"  attitude of the communist leaders adding that delay in the talks  will only put their group at a disadvantage.    "The more they make us wait, the more they can be  marginalized," Dee said.    President Ramos earlier said that after 25 years of  existence, the Communist Party of the Philippines have failed to  successfully push their ideology and even resulted in party rift.    Dee said the talks is now temporarily stalled since the CPP  leaders have yet to answer government demands that the  preconditions to the preliminary talks pushed by CPP head Jose  Maria Sison be removed.    Dee said Sison is proposing that the preliminary talks be  held in Europe, either in Brussels, Netherlands or Luxembourg so  that Sison who is in exile in Utrecht will have no difficulty in  getting travel documents.    Dee stressed that the preliminary talks which they both  agreed should precede the exploratory talks in Vietnam should  tackle only the ground rules and physical arrangements for the  talks.    He said the contentious issues which Sison and his groups  want resolved before the preliminary talks should instead be  included as agenda during the exploratory talks.</p>

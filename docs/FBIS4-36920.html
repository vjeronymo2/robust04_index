			<p>BFN     [Text] Mohammad Nawaz Sharif, leader of the opposition in  the National Assembly, has filed a constitutional petition with  the Lahore High Court in which he requested that the provincial  government be restrained from filing cases against him.    A spokesman for the Governor's House in Lahore has rejected  reports on the possible arrest of opposition leader Mian  Mohammad Nawaz Sharif. He said that the provincial governor had  given no interview to the GULF NEWS as was reported; therefore,  the reports are baseless, fabricated, and speculative.</p>

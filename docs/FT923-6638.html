			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Invest without risk MANY PEOPLE like the idea of investing in the stock market but are scared of losing their capital. Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial Marketing is the latest company to try to attack this problem, with a fund called Protected Capital Plus. The idea is to give investors exposure to stock market growth while ensuring that their capital never falls in value. The Foreign &amp; Colonial product is a new twist on an old concept. The bulk of the investor's money is invested in interest-bearing deposits, which grow to repay his capital. The remainder is invested in futures and options to give fundholders the equity-kicker. What makes the F&amp;C fund different is that the process happens quarterly. Say you have invested Pounds 10,000. If after three months the stock market has fallen, you will still have Pounds 10,000. If, however, a strong stock market means the fund grows by 10 per cent, you will have Pounds 11,000. That will be your base capital for the next three months; gains, once made, cannot be lost. You can withdraw your money, without charge, at the end of any quarter. That gives the fund an advantage over similar products which tie-up your capital for years. Inevitably, these advantages have their costs. The fund does not pay an income. But when you sell your holding, any gain is subject to income, rather than capital gains, tax. Since most people do not use up their annual CGT allowance (now Pounds 5,800), this puts the fund in a worse tax position than a unit or investment trust. Furthermore, the fund does not give the investor the full benefit of equity investment. Much depends on the cost of the options which the fund buys. If the market has been turbulent, the options will be expensive, limiting the fund's ability to match the index. Over three months, F&amp;C reckons that, when the market rises, the fund will achieve a return equal to about 60 per cent of the increase in the FT-SE 100 index. But the investor will 'catch up' in quarters when the market falls and the fund's value remains stable. On that basis, the fund would have earned an average 13.7 per cent gross a year between 1980 and 1992, compared with a gross return of 11.1 per cent from a building society over the same period. There are two caveats about safety. F&amp;C is not guaranteeing the return of capital - it is possible that the deposit element of the fund might invest in a bank which goes bust. The fund will strive to avoid this by investing only in banks rated AA and above. The second caveat is that this is an offshore fund, based in Jersey and unrecognised by the Securities and Investments Board. As such, it can be sold only by professional advisers. The minimum investment is Pounds 5,000. There is an initial charge of 5 per cent and an annual management charge of 0.9 per cent.</p>

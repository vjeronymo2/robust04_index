			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> STROKE VICTIMS' GATE TO ACTIVITY  </P> <P> Every Thursday for the past three years, 10 members of the Niko-Niko Club in  Gardena have gathered at a local park to play gate ball -- a Japanese  adaptation of croquet.  </P> <P> The players, whose ages range from 59 to 90, have either suffered strokes or  are spouses of stroke victims.  </P> <P> Gate ball is their escape from household routine.  </P> <P> "It's good for our heart," said Tsugie Minove, 76.  </P> <P> Minove, who had a stroke in 1981, said the game is a good form of exercise and  helps the seniors stay energetic. "Otherwise, we just sit around," she said.  "This way, we are active and (don't) just stay home and watch TV."  </P> <P> The game, although not strenuous, is competitive. Players, divided into two  teams, take 30-minute turns trying to score as many points as possible by  hitting their balls through the gates while simultaneously knocking their  opponents' balls off the course.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JOSEPH N. BELL: HARD HATS MAY WELL COME TO THE BARD'S RESCUE  </P> <P> My wife and I rediscovered William Shakespeare in an unlikely place this  summer. At least Garden Grove seemed to me an unlikely setting to feed cultural  appetites. It seems even more unlikely today after the City Council withdrew  the support money for its splendid Shakespeare theater company and thus forced  it to close down after its upcoming run of "The Importance of Being Earnest,"  which begins Oct. 4.  </P> <P> I feel a considerable sense of personal loss, like a new friend who suddenly  moves away just when the promise of intimacy becomes very real. The arts have  been so badly battered in this country over the past year -- artists must feel  like punch-drunk fighters, flailing out in every direction when they should be  concentrating on their craft -- that it is hard anymore to feel anger. The  action in Garden Grove just saddened and depressed me.  </P> <P> We spent three warm, delicious nights last summer watching Shakespeare under  the stars in Garden Grove. We watched "As You Like It" and "Much Ado About  Nothing" and an evening of readings from the Bard which -- unlike the purists  -- we found delightful. We were looking forward to expanding this feast next  summer.  </P> <P> I wasn't present Monday night when the Garden Grove City Council denied the  Grove Shakespeare Festival emergency funds that would have carried it through  the rest of the season.  </P> <P> But from accounts in The Times and conversations with people who were there, it  would appear that a majority of the council believed that the company should do  "American" plays and regards Shakespeare as a foreign intrusion that speaks an  unwelcome cultural language. Apparently the same feeling applies to the  Festival's production of Dylan Thomas' "A Child's Christmas in Wales" which has  become a staple for children in the community and will be washed out by the  council's action.  </P> <P> Satirizing this kind of provincial, jingo reasoning would be easy. Like  shooting fish in a barrel. But at least one member of the festival family chose  to address this attitude directly and seriously in the council meeting -- and I  asked him later to enlarge on those remarks for me.  </P> <P> David Herman -- who directed "Othello" at the festival this summer -- has  impressive credentials for speaking out. He is English, once lived in  Stratford-on-Avon where Shakespeare was born, served an apprenticeship as an  actor with the Royal Shakespeare Company, and has been connected with the  theater all of his working life.  </P> <P> He told me that he arrived at the council meeting late, "when the debate was  coming to a head, and I couldn't believe what I was hearing. The sense of it  was that the work being produced by the festival theater was not American, and  we needed to get some American culture in here instead of all this Shakespeare  stuff. I had a strong feeling that money was not the problem, that the council  majority was a lot more concerned with the nature of what they were supporting  than with fiscal policy.  </P> <P> "They were stepping on this theater as if it were a bug to be annihilated.  There seemed little concern with the impact on the community of rejecting this  small amount of aid. They apparently felt that this theater provided no real  connection with the people of the community, and we were simply an elitist  group pushing our own agenda. I felt that someone should address this feeling  simply and directly."  </P> <P> So Herman did. He told the council that when he first came to Los Angeles five  years ago, he knew nothing about Garden Grove or the Shakespeare Festival. "But  when I was introduced to it, I was struck with a splendid contribution it made  to an area with a multiethnic base. Building a theater season in such an area  around the plays of Shakespeare seemed to me both visionary and enlightened.  </P> <P> "Why? Because of the enormous impact Shakespeare has made on every country and  in every language of the world. Shakespeare truly speaks a universal language,  and this is the only Orange County theater that offers his voice regularly and  highly professionally. I couldn't imagine a better community for this to take  place."  </P> <P> His words didn't change any votes, but probably nothing would have at that  point -- not even pointing out the supreme irony of rejecting Shakespeare as  elitist in what one councilman described as a "hard-hat community."  </P> <P> Shakespeare wrote for the hard hats of his day. They were the people who  flocked to his plays -- and still do in other countries of the world.  </P> <P> But the dedicated people who kept the festival afloat most of this year through  increasingly hard times are not yet ready to throw it in -- even under the  possible threat of cancellation of the festival's lease on the city-owned  theater.  </P> <P> With their major sources of public revenue denied them, they can look only to  private support. "And," as one of their officials told me wryly, "we don't  attract the heavy hitters. We don't offer the glitz and panache of South Coast  Repertory or the Performing Arts Center."  </P> <P> So they're going after the lighter hitters -- you and me -- with two  fund-raisers in October they hope will begin to underwrite a new season next  year, and perhaps even save their Christmas show.  </P> <P> There will be a walkathon -- called, naturally, "Walk for William" -- that will  start at 8 a.m. on Saturday, Oct. 13; it will cost $20, and each participant  will be given a T-shirt to commemorate the event. The walkathon will be  followed at noon by an auction of the company's costumes and props. They will  be "cleaning out Shakespeare's closet" in a kind of medieval garage sale.  </P> <P> The second event will be a Monte Carlo night on Oct. 26 at the Garden Grove  Community Center; the cost, $15 or two for $25. All of the money thus raised  will go directly to support the Grove Shakespeare Festival.  </P> <P> All this agony over a few thousand dollars -- a pittance in a county as wealthy  as this one -- seems to point up two fundamental problems: There are certain  types of cultural events -- opera, ballet, classic theater -- which will always  hold little interest for the majority but which are absolutely essential in the  lifeblood of a healthy society. In a system like ours where politicians are so  directly accountable to the majority, we need means -- either through sizable  private or routinely budgeted public funds -- to sustain and nourish the arts.  </P> <P> And second, what is happening to the Grove Festival is not just of concern to  the citizens of Garden Grove. This is the second largest theater -- and the  only one with a regular menu of classics -- in Orange County, and those of us  who want to see it back for another season need to demonstrate that in tangible  ways. Like money.  </P> <P> Of course if some of those billionaire South County developers decided that  this might be a good place to put a few thousand, it would be gratefully  received. They wouldn't even have to take part in the walkathon. And neither do  you and I.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Diesel fuel. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not apply to diesel fuel held exclusively for an exempt use. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining whether diesel fuel is held exclusively for an exempt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use, the following rules in paragraphs (a)(2) (i) through (iv) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this section apply:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) An exempt use, with respect to diesel fuel, is any use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of diesel fuel (other than use in producing a diesel fuel/alcohol  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mixture or as fuel in a diesel-powered train) that is described  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in section 6427 and that entitles the ultimate purchaser to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credit or payment equal to the tax imposed by section 4091.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, for example, exempt uses of diesel fuel include use other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than as a fuel in a diesel-powered highway vehicle (as defined in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;48.4041&hyph;8(b)(4) of this chapter), use on a farm for farming  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes, exclusive use by a State or local government or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonprofit educational organization, and use in an off-highway  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> business use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Diesel fuel held for use in a diesel-powered train is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not exempt from the October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax under this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (a)(2) unless the fuel is held by a State or local  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> government. Thus, the exemptions for use other than as fuel in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diesel-powered highway vehicle and off-highway business use do  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not apply to fuel used in a diesel-powered train. See section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6427(l)(3) as amended by section 13241 of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Diesel fuel is held exclusively for an exempt use only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if the person that holds the fuel at the first moment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> October 1, 1993, actually uses the diesel fuel in an exempt use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Diesel fuel is not held exclusively for an exempt use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if, at the first moment of October 1, 1993, the diesel fuel is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> held for resale (including resale to a person that will use the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diesel fuel in an exempt use). Thus, for example, diesel fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> held by a retailer for sale to a construction company for use in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the construction company's off-road machinery is not exempt from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax. However, the construction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> company would be eligible to claim a credit or payment equal to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the tax under section 6427.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Aviation fuel. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not apply to aviation fuel held exclusively for an exempt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use. In determining whether aviation fuel is held exclusively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for an exempt use, the following rules in paragraphs (a)(3) (i)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through (iii) of this section apply:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) An exempt use, with respect to aviation fuel, is any use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of aviation fuel that is described in section 6427 and that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entitles the ultimate purchaser to a credit or payment equal to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the tax imposed by section 4091. Thus, for example, exempt use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of aviation fuel includes any use on a farm for farming purposes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exclusive use by a State or local government or nonprofit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> educational organization, and use other than use as a fuel in an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aircraft in noncommercial aviation (as defined in section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4041(c)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Aviation fuel is held exclusively for an exempt use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only if the person that holds the aviation fuel at the first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> moment of October 1, 1993, actually uses the aviation fuel in an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exempt use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Aviation fuel is not held exclusively for an exempt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use if, at the first moment of October 1, 1993, the aviation fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is held for resale (including resale to a person that will use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the aviation fuel in an exempt use). Thus, for example, aviation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel held by a fixed-base operator for sale to an airline for use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in commercial aviation is not exempt from the October 1, 1993,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> floor stocks tax. However, the airline would be eligible to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claim a credit or payment equal to the tax under section 6427.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Exception for gasoline or diesel fuel held in vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel supply tank. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apply to gasoline or diesel fuel held at the first moment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> October 1, 1993, in the fuel supply tank of a motor vehicle (as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> defined in &sect;48.4041&hyph;8(c) of this chapter) or motorboat. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exception does not apply to fuel held in the fuel supply tank of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a train or an aircraft.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Exception for certain amounts of fuel <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In general. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax does not apply to_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Gasoline that a person holds at the first moment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> October 1, 1993, if the aggregate amount of gasoline held by that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> person at that moment does not exceed 4,000 gallons; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Diesel fuel or aviation fuel that a person holds at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first moment of October 1, 1993, if the aggregate amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diesel fuel or the aggregate amount of aviation fuel held by that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> person at that moment does not exceed 2,000 gallons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Additional rules <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Coordination with other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exemptions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In determining the aggregate amount of gasoline,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diesel fuel, or aviation fuel held by a person at the first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> moment of October 1, 1993, there is excluded the amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasoline, diesel fuel, or aviation fuel exempt from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax by reason of paragraph (a) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this section (relating to fuel held for exempt uses), or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (b) of this section (relating to gasoline and diesel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel held in the fuel supply tank of a motor vehicle or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> motorboat).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> All amounts held subject to tax if threshold exceeded. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax applies to all amounts of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasoline, diesel fuel, or aviation fuel (as the case may be) held  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by a person (and not exempt from tax under paragraph (a) or (b)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this section) if the aggregate amount of fuel held by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> person at the first moment of October 1, 1993, exceeds 4,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gallons in the case of gasoline or 2,000 gallons in the case of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diesel fuel or aviation fuel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

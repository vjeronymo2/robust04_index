The officials are considering banning cash remittances,  grounding North Korea-bound sea vessels and aircraft, conducting  export checks at Niigata on the Sea of Japan and refusing to  issue reentry permits to travelers going to the isolated  socialist state, government sources said.    North Korea denies that it is trying to build an atomic bomb  but continues to deny international inspectors access to its  more suspicious facilities. On Monday, the UN nuclear monitor  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) urged Pyongyang to  comply with its safeguard measures and referred the issue to the  UN Security Council, which could impose sanctions.    Analysts have suggested that the sanctions would have little  effect on the already impoverished nation, which receives  backing from China and an estimated 60 billion yen annually from  pro-Pyongyang Korean residents in Japan.    Attempts to halt the money flow are likely to be thwarted by  a confusing array of routes the money takes through banks, in  cash, in trade transactions and through third nations on its  journey from Japan to North Korea. Some is sent to relatives of  Korean residents living in Japan but the U.S. insists the money  is being used to fund the alleged arms program.    If sanctions are imposed, the government intends to do what  it can within the limits of the law but worries about  remittances making their way to Pyongyang through third nations,  informed sources said.    Government sources suggested the Security Council will  likely  seek a way for the inspectors to complete the inspections in  North Korea and is not immediately discussing a resolution on  sanctions.    The sources said Japan intends to keep close contacts with  the U.S., China and South Korea in an attempt to reach a  peaceful resolution to the nuclear problem through dialogue.</p>

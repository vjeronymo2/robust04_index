			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Increased core demand helps Kwik-Fit to Pounds 11.5m HIGHER demand for tyres and exhausts and a third year of stringent cost control helped Kwik-Fit Holdings report a rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 11.5m for the six months to August 31 against Pounds 9.74m. The company had gained a little market share in the period, Mr Tom Farmer, chairman, said. 'As long as there's cars on the road and as long as the consumer has money to spend on the repairs to those cars then we will get a substantial share of that market.' Kwik-Fit began its push into the brake replacement market in July. 'Early indications have shown that this could become an important growth area for Kwik-Fit and by October of this year we will be in a position to offer and market this service through 90 per cent of our centres,' Mr Farmer said. The move is expected to cost about Pounds 2.5m in training and advertising expenses this year. Kwik-Fit believes the brake replacement market is worth more than Pounds 500m, twice the value of the current exhaust replacement market. Group turnover increased 11 per cent to Pounds 132.1m (Pounds 119.2m) on the back of increased demand for tyres and exhausts. Operating profits rose 36 per cent to Pounds 12.3m (Pounds 9.08m) but the gain at the pre-tax level was limited by a fall in profits from asset sales to Pounds 207,000 from Pounds 1.73m. Capital expenditure fell from Pounds 9m to Pounds 3.3m. Net interest and other financial charges fell slightly to Pounds 1.06m, compared with Pounds 1.07m. The board declared an increased interim dividend of 1.5p (1.35p) out of earnings per share higher at 4.7p, against 3.82p. COMMENT Kwik-Fit has done well to gain market share and lift profits in its static markets and in the face of growing competition from car dealers. There are, however, challenges to continuing growth. Consumers still prefer lower margin economy tyres and it will be hard to achieve more than modest growth in its share of the stable exhaust pipe market it dominates. But the company and the City have high hopes of its well-timed and inexpensive move into brakes. But the Netherlands' operations look back on track, making useful contribution to profits. With pre-tax forecasts about Pounds 21m to Pounds 22m, a multiple of about 20 looks expensive.</p>

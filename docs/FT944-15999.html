			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Aerostructures' second warning: A look at the saga of a share price collapse It has been an interesting six months for Mr Andy Barr, the dour Scottish chief executive of Aerostructures Hamble, the company which makes aircraft sections for British Aerospace. He has moved from talking confidently of his group's prospects at the company's flotation, through pocketing a Pounds 1.75m profit when the company was floated at 120p a share, via a production crisis and management failure, to two profits warnings, a share price collapse to 24p and his own early retirement with a stress-related illness. Shareholders, who stumped up Pounds 39m when the company was floated in June, have seen the value of their investment drop by 80 per cent and are understandably hopping mad. The company's adviser, NM Rothschild, and its non-executive chairman, Lord King, have been severely embarrassed. On top of that, the collapse raises questions about the whole process of new issues in London. The problems apparently started innocently enough in February, when Aerostructures finished work on the first of a batch of Harrier fighter aircraft sections. Unfortunately, there were quality difficulties with the aircraft sections, so in May shopfloor managers instructed the factory to produce components for the entire batch of 12 Harriers, sufficient for two years, instead of the normal three months' stock. The factory geared up to do this and no-one seemed to notice that unusual work patterns were developing. In June British Aerospace, Aerostructures' dominant customer, said that it wanted to increase the production rate of its Hawk 100 and 200 light fighters. Aerostructures agreed. At this point the factory seized up. Much of the effort was going into making the unnecessary Harrier parts and as a result critical components for other orders could not be made. Several important contracts started to fall badly behind in the gridlock. Unfortunately again, over this period much senior management time was diverted to preparing the company's flotation. Aerostructures had been bought out from BAe two years previously and several directors stood to make a handsome profit. It was not until July 12 that a senior management committee discussed the seriousness of the production problems. Mr Brian Barr, the chief executive's son who had come with his father from Rover, was the production director responsible for the factory's performance. He made a profit of almost Pounds 600,000 on the shares he sold at the flotation in June. Mr Barr remains with the company, although he has been moved to engineering. Two days after the meeting Mr Andy Barr went on holiday for two weeks. On August 1 he returned to say that his doctor had instructed him to take a month's leave. Several orders for future work were also cancelled in August. BAe, which had promised the company work in 1995, suspended any decision until the problems were resolved. On September 6 Mr Barr finally went to Lord King with several handwritten pages of notes to confess that there was a serious problem. Rothschild was informed on September 15 and a profits warning issued a week later. Since then an investigation has been going on and the company produced its second profits warning yesterday. Mr Andy Barr accepted early retirement without compensation last week. He will receive a pension of about Pounds 40,000 a year. The company's results, for the six months to June, showed little sign of the damage. That will show up in the second half. Next year the company expects turnover to drop by about 20 per cent. Whether it makes any profit depends on whether orders can be met and costs cut. In part, the crisis arose because senior managers took their eye off the ball. Both Andy and Brian Barr were keen to introduce Rover-style lean manufacturing techniques which applied to mass production, and may not have properly monitored the old-style techniques used in the Harrier. It is also questionable whether redundancies made in 1993 removed key skills in manufacturing and process management, which the company needed to prevent such disasters. Aerostructures says that the redundancies made no difference; nevertheless it has recently been trying to hire people with experience of Harrier manufacture. Then there is the issue of whether the flotation prompted managers to cut too many jobs to improve profits, and then took up too much of their time in preparing mountains of paperwork. It may be that the cumbersome process, designed to protect investors, played a part in precipitating the crisis. One City figure who understood the deal said: 'I think this raises questions for the regulators about the way we handle deals for companies of this size.' Earlier this year Mr Andy Barr, sitting in his elegant office in a 1750s listed house on the Hamble site, said: 'Not until we came from Rover down here did we realise how Rover had moved in practices and quality.' Aerostructures was 'getting leaner all the time - but it gets tougher as you go on'. For Aerostructures' shareholders, it certainly did.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In Friday's opening address to a national conference  on housing policies under free-market relations Russia's First  Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets said that in a bid to stabilize the  sphere of housing construction with the help of private  investment, President Yeltsin has signed a packet of new  decrees. The conference opened in the State Palace of the  Moscow Kremlin. President Yeltsin is attending its sittings.    Soskovets said Yeltsin signed a decree on housing loans, a  decree on construction certificates and a decree on the sale of,  and commercial investment in, unfinished construction projects.    According to Soskovets, the national budget revenue in the  first five months of 1994 fell 5.2 trillion rubles short of its  target. He felt economic recovery depended, in great measure, on  investment in housing construction. He said the government must  offer private entrepreneurs reliable, including state,  guarantees for investment in that field.    A second packet of legislation on more economic reform is in  the making and legal moves are being made to reduce, as of 1996,  basic, including profit and value added, taxes by 10 to 20  percent, Soskovets said. The government, he said, also intends  to hold tenders among those wishing to sell products to the  state and intends to sell part of unfinished construction  projects to private entrepreneurs in a bid to lure more private  investment into the industry.</p>

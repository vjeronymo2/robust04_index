			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / NatWest to close 35 bank branches in West End NATIONAL Westminster Bank is to close 35 of its 90 branches in the West End of London over the next five years and move their back-office work to two processing centres. The reorganisation may serve as a model for branch banking nationally. About 300 of the 2,900 jobs in the West End are likely to be lost. The money saved will be spent on redesigning remaining branches to allow more interaction between staff and customers. National Westminster said yesterday that there would be no compulsory redundancies. The cuts will form part of national reductions. The bank wants to lose 10,000 staff over the next two years. The new design will allow more space for selling products such as investments, mortgages and foreign currency. There will also be more space for automatic teller machines in the open-plan branches. The bank said the West End would be the first of its 22 regions to complete the reorganisation. It was likely that a smaller proportion of branches would be closed elsewhere. The West End has a large number of branches dating from the merger of the National Provincial and Westminster banks. The bank has about 2,500 branches across the country, the largest branch network of any clearer. All clearing banks are trying to reorganise branch networks to cut costs and sell more products. They are attempting to reduce processing costs by centralising functions such as cheque clearing. National Westminster is allocating more staff to act as account managers to ensure each customer has access to one. It opened a model new branch in Victoria Street, London, 18 months ago which reverses the traditional proportion of floorspace, giving customers more space than staff for the first time. Standard Chartered Plc will make 77 of its 1,000-strong UK banking staff redundant by the end of the year. The bank said the redundancies would be among operational staff in corporate banking.</p>

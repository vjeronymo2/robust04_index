			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The labor conflict begun by the Rovinari Federation  of Free Trade Unions has spread, practically speaking,  throughout the coal mining region administered by the Targu Jiu  Autonomous Lignite Public Corporation, our correspondent Titus  Stoichitoiu reports. Over 65,000 employees have stopped work,  the only departments still functioning being those that  transport personnel inside the pits and deliver coal to the  population.    Another warning strike and a rally was announced today by  employees of the Targu Jiu [mining equipment] Repair Plant.  Similarly, the Lignite Mining Trade Union Confederation, which  is affiliated to the union confederation headed by Miron Cosma  [union leader of the Jiu Valley miners], requested permission to  organize a rally at Rovinari, but the local police and mayor's  office refused, suggesting that it should be postponed until  after the general strike in the region.</p>

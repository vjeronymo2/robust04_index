			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> CSF APPROACHES 'MONEY GAME'  </P> <P> Gene Murphy makes no bones about it. Cal State Fullerton is visiting  third-ranked Auburn on Saturday for the money.  </P> <P> "This is definitely a money game, not only for our football program but for the  athletic program as a whole," said Murphy, whose team will receive a reported  $250,000 to serve as Auburn's opening-day patsy.  </P> <P> "This is something we have to do to exist.  </P> <P> "But we're not just coming down to Auburn to pick up a guaranteed check. We're  coming down to become a better football team. We're going to play every snap  and every down the best we can. Whether or not that's realistic, I don't know."  </P> <P> Especially when the Titans lost three valuable players in their season-opening  38-24 victory over Division II Sonoma State last week. Starting tailback Deon  Thomas injured a knee in the second quarter and is lost for the season. Wide  receiver Kerry Reed and offensive guard Shannon Illingworth also suffered  injuries that will keep them out of the lineup for several weeks.  </P></p>

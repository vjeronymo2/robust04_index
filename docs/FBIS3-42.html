			<p>SUMMARY                                          Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev hailed the results of his  meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher as  indicating that the U.S.-Russian partnership is able to surmount  recent strains and continue to develop.  Kozyrev's reaction  contrasted with his recent statements on the bilateral  relationship in which he suggested that Russia was being  relegated to a subordinate role ill-suited to its capabilities  and national interests.                                       END SUMMARY     Kozyrev gave an upbeat assessment of the state of U.S.-Russian  relations following his 14 March meeting with Secretary  Christopher in Vladivostok.  He expressed satisfaction with the  results of the meeting, emphasizing that the two countries acted  as equals during discussions on a broad range of international  issues.  Dismissing the recent strains in the relationship,  Kozyrev asserted that "we are partners and we will continue to  work in this direction" (ITAR-TASS, 14 March).  He told reporters  that "circles" in both Russia and the United States object to the  "mature and strategic nature" of the bilateral relationship and  that "all sorts of hiccups and problems," like ex-President  Richard Nixon's protocol difficulties or "spy fever," are bound  to occur, "but we are too serious to give into them" (Interfax,  14 March).     Previous Concerns     Prior to the meeting, Kozyrev had expressed concerns about the  state of U.S.-Russian relations and suggested that adjustments to  the partnership needed to be made:     -- On the eve of his departure from Moscow for Vladivostok, he  told reporters that the aim of the meeting would be to develop  the partnership on a "new basis," stressing that there could be  no question of a "junior" or"senior" partner, or "more freedom  for one to the detriment of the other."  Rejecting suggestions  that relations had begun to cool, he noted that there can be  "differing interests" within the partnership (Moscow radio, 14  March).     -- Similarly, in a 10 March television interview he said that he  and Christopher would discuss what form of partnership the two  countries should have, stressing that "we should agree on this so  it does not cause annoyance" or "come as a surprise when Russia  comes out with its own initiative."  Noting that Russia feels  "offended" when U.S. officials launch an initiative that the two  countries should have agreed upon together, Kozyrev said that  such differences needed to be "clarified" and a "mechanism for  interaction" should be "finalized" (Moscow TV, 10 March).     -- In an article on U.S.-Russian relations published in Izvestiya  on 11 March, he also called for adjustments in the relationship,  while at the same time stressing that "there is no reasonable  alternative to partnership," which he implied is essential to  shape a democratic Russia and "transform the unstable post-  communist world into a lasting democratic one."  He claimed that  Russian and U.S. national interests concerning "the main world  problems" not only "do not conflict" but "complement each other."  He stressed, however, that "certain illusions" such as a Western  view that "if the Russians are good they must follow us in  everything," or a Russian view that partnership "is an idyllic  situation without conflicts and problems" must be abandoned.  He  contended that partnership "based on common values and  sympathies" does not mean renouncing "competition and disputes"  or "a firm or aggressive policy of upholding your own national  interests."  He cautioned, moreover, that agreeing to play a  subordinate role would be as "unwarranted as it is politically  dangerous" for Russia in view of the "extreme nationalist and  reactionary [domesticj forces" who would "immediately take  advantage" of such a stance.  Warning that exponents "of gloomy  self-fulfilling prophecies" would exploit U.S.-Russian disputes  if they continue, he called upon the two countries to develop a  strategy and instruments for partnership, and particularly a  mechanism "for coordinating their actions" on international  problems.     Media Concerns About Relationship     Russia media commentary on the Vladivostok meeting has so far  been sparse, but its thrust has been to dismiss the upbeat  official assessments of the meeting and continue to focus on  problems facing the relationship.  A 15 March commentary in the  reformist newspaper Kommersant-Daily dismissed the official line  that the meeting "plastered over the cracks" in the relationship,  asserting that despite "the upbeat tone of the joint statement,"  "more cracks may develop soon."  Commenting on Russia's new  involvement in the Middle East, the article noted that U.S.  actions in the region were "emphatically independent from Moscow"  and warned that "there is an obvious rivalry in Middle East  peacemaking between Moscow and Washington."  In a 16 March  article in the reformist newspaper Segodnya, a commentator,  chiding the "incompetence" of both U.S. and Russian officials,  contended that the Russian Foreign Ministry, by displaying the  "most intense activity possible," had created a "legend" about  "stunning foreign policy successes" that could trigger U.S. ideas  about "containment."  The commentator said that Washington  appeared "ready to go to any lengths" to prevent a return to a  "global nuclear standoff," but warned that the "stabilization in  bilateral relations" proclaimed at Vladivostok "may be  shortlived."     Before the meeting, Russian media commentators had speculated  about whether or how badly U.S.-Russian relations had been  damaged in the wake of controversy over Bosnia, the Ames spy  case, the Nixon visit, and other differences.  Some commentators,  echoing Kozyrev, tried to minimize any coolness or weakening in  the partnership while others, ignoring the Vladivostok meeting,  contended that the United States had already changed its policy  toward Russia:     -- Echoing the government line, Moscow radio commentaries on 12  March played down any differences.  Commentator Yuriy Solton said  Secretary Christopher had refuted reports that Washington was  dissatisfied with Moscow's active policy in Yugoslavia, noting  that he had said the United States welcomed Russia's initiatives,  in Bosnia and elsewhere.  Solton stressed that statements that  U.S.-Russian relations had become "more strained" or "in poor  condition" were "absolutely groundless."  Admitting that each  country "wants to pursue its own end," Solton emphasized that  Moscow and Washington were doing this "in close cooperation with  each other" and without any of the "rivalry" of the Cold War.  Contending that both Moscow and Washington saw their main task as  consistently improving their relationship, Solton said this task  would "define" the atmosphere at Vladivostok.  Likewise,  commentator Valentin Zorin, dismissing the recent disputes as  occurring in a period marked by "the loss of illusions" on both  sides, stressed that "global confrontation" between the two  countries is "a thing of the past" and that "what unites them is  so much more important that frictions that may emerge."     -- In contrast, a 5 March article in the mass-circulation  newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda took issue with Secretary  Christopher's reported statement that Russia could not act  unilaterally in responding to appeals for military assistance  from countries of the former Soviet Union, but could only respond  under the auspices of the United Nations or other international  organizations.  The article also alleged that the Secretary had  commented on Russian President Boris Yeltsin's 24 February  speech, which had spoken of Russia's right to act to ensure  stability and protect Russians in the near abroad, "with some  scorn."  Contending that the warnings from Washington were an  attempt to keep Russia in the inferior state to which it had been  reduced in recent years, often by the "shortsightedness of  [Russian] diplomats," and to "guarantee" Washington's  "superpowerdom," the article advised Kozyrev to have a "serious  talk" about this with Secretary Christopher in Vladivostok.     -- A 12 March article by prominent foreign affairs commentator  Aleksandr Golts in the Defense Ministry's newspaper, Krasnaya  Zvezda, titled "The Chill Must Not Develop Into Confrontation,"  warned that "conflicts and microcrises" in U.S.-Russian relations  had been following each other "virtually without interruption and  in ever-increasing intensity."  Criticizing Washington for, among  other things, intensifying U.S. involvement in CIS affairs in  order to prevent the revival of a dreaded Russian "empire," Golts  charged that such an approach not only was inappropriate for  states "that only yesterday were calling themselves allies," but  went "beyond the bounds of common sense" and could scuttle  efforts to settle conflicts.  Taking issue-with Secretary  Christopher's remarks on Russian peacekeeping efforts, Golts  asked with evident sarcasm if the United States allowed its own  freedom of action to be restricted "anywhere at all" by  consultations with international organizations.  Golts contended  that Russia's active involvement in trying to end conflicts both  in the former Soviet republics and elsewhere was important not  only because Moscow was "offering sensible ways to end the  suffering of thousands," but also because it strengthened  Russia's self-esteem by demonstrating that Russia was a state  that could resolve global problems.  While asserting that US.-  Russian differences were "not insoluble," Golts warned that  neither Russia nor the United States can afford the "luxury of a  new confrontation" while they search for a new model of mutual  relations, and he called upon both states to use the Vladivostok  meeting to "prevent undesirable developments."     -- A 12 March article in the pro-Yeltsin newspaper Izvestiya  headlined that U.S.-Russian relations are experiencing "the most  serious crisis of recent years."  In describing the reasons for  the "time of coolness," the article supported Moscow's "proper"  response to the Nixon visit and diplomatic activism in the  Balkans, the Middle East, and the "near abroad," but fretted over  how Washington might react to such policy "changes."  For  example, the article cited a "Western diplomat" as complaining  that after the reformers' poor showing in the December  parliamentary elections, the Yeltsin administration adopted the  "slogans of the opposition," adding it was difficult to know who  was making foreign policy pronouncements--Kozyrev or Communist  leader Gennadiy Zyuganov.  Ending on an optimistic note, the  article reported that the Russian Foreign Ministry would "strive  to avoid confrontation with Washington" at Vladivostok and quoted  an "informed" ministry source as saying "there are no major  reasons for exacerbating" U.S.-Russian relations.     -- Ignoring the upcoming meeting entirely in a 12 March article  in procommunist newspaper Pravda, commentator Vladislav Drobkov  reported on what he called "Washington's change of direction" and  "campaign" to reevalute relations with Russia and develop ties  with other countries of the former Soviet Union.  Claiming that  all his Washington interlocutors had "invariably" said that  "coolness" had set in between Moscow and Washington, Drobkov  backed up his argument by quoting alleged statements about Russia  by U.S. officials.  For example, he quoted Senator Richard Lugar  as saying "[The United States] is not Russia's partner, we are  bitter rivals."     Implications     Kozyrev's efforts to play down any substantive differences with  Washington probably reflect Moscow's determination to keep  bilateral relations on track, but his emphasis on achieving  equality in the relationship indicates an equally strong  determination that Russia not be relegated to what Russians would  view as an inferior role.  The media's continuing preoccupation  with the differences and disputes between Washington and Moscow  suggests an ongoing tension between pride that Russia is resuming  what is perceived as its rightful role as a global power and  concern that a confrontation with Washington might revive a Cold  War-like climate.

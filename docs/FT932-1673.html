			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / The Copenhagen Summit: Refusal to attend peace talks puts future of Izetbegovic in doubt MEMBERS of Bosnia's collective presidency will attend peace talks in Geneva today without their leader, President Alija Izetbegovic, after failing to persuade him to participate in the negotiations. Mr Izetbegovic's absence reflects a serious split in the presidency over whether proposals put forward by the Serbs and Croats for the creation of three ethnic mini-states in Bosnia, linked only by very loose confederal ties, could serve as the basis of a peace settlement. It is likely, sooner or later, to lead to the replacement of Mr Izetbegovic, whose term of office in the rotating presidency was extended last December for the duration of the war in Bosnia. However, Mr Fikret Abdic, a moderate Moslem member of the presidency, yesterday strongly denied suggestions that he was trying to unseat Mr Izetbegovic. The leader of the Bosnian delegation at the Geneva talks would be Mr Franjo Boras, a Croat member of the presidency, and not himself, Mr Abdic said. 'I do not want the central issue to be Mr Izetbegovic's replacement. The central issue is peace in Bosnia.' Mr Izetbegovic flew straight to Zagreb from Copenhagen on Monday night, after failing to persuade European Community leaders to support the lifting of the United Nations embargo on arms sales to Bosnia, in spite of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's backing for such a move. By the time Mr Izetbegovic arrived in the Croatian capital, the other eight members of the presidency had already voted 7-1 in favour of participation in the Geneva talks today. Only vice president Ejup Ganic, joined later by Mr Izetbegovic, opposed such a step, and refused to go. The other members of the Bosnian presidency, who have been invited to the talks by Lord Owen, one of the two international mediators, are joining Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman in Geneva to hear more details of their proposals, unveiled in outline last week. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, and Mr Mate Boban, his Croat opposite number, are also expected to attend the talks. Mr Tudjman has indicated that the Serbian-Croat proposals, due to be presented separately but after co-ordination of the two sides' positions, will consist of a division of Bosnia into three largely homogeneous ethnic cantons, similar to an earlier EC plan drawn up by Mr Jose Cutileiro of Portugal. However, both the Bosnian Moslem and Croatian parts of the country would be divided into two separate geographical areas, making five regions altogether. The general assumption in EC capitals is that, while the Bosnian Serbs will have to withdraw from some of the territory occupied by them since the outbreak of the conflict 14 months ago, they will not have to give up as much as under the now defunct Vance-Owen plan.</p>

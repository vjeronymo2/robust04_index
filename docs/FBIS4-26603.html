			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Hu Qili, Minister of Electronics Industry: </F> "Develop the Information Industry and the Economic Information  Network, Promote Information Service for the National Economy"]    [Text] I. Developing the Information Industry,  Establishing a National Economic Information Network, and  Promoting Information Services for the Economy and Society Are  Badly Needed for China's Modernization Drive and Are a Great  Trend in the World's Economic and Technological Development    The world's economic development is changing from  industrialization to an information world. As the pillar for  the information science, the electronics industry has become a  strategic industry in the world today. Judging from developed  countries' course of development over the past decades, the  electronics industry has played a very crucial role in promoting  technological progress, carrying out industrial reform,  enhancing labor productivity, and speeding economic development,  in the readjustment of the economic structure, and in the course  of developing human civilizations and promoting social progress.  The speedy development of electronic technology, especially  software and information services, has formed the electronic  information industry -- represented by microelectronics, and  computer, communications, and software technology -- and  continues to cause drastic changes in society, the economy, and  people's lifestyles.    The CPC Central Committee and the State Council attach great  importance to the development of China's information services.  Not long ago, the State Council officially set up the National  Joint Conference on Economic Information to organize and plan  the development of China's economic information services. With  the direct concern of the top party and state leadership, it has  been decided to implement the "Three Golden Projects" (Golden  Bridge, Golden Pass, and Golden Card Projects), thus placing the  quickening of China's economic information services high on the  agenda. This is a major policy decision for China's  modernization and is a strategic measure for achieving the  second- and third-step goals of national economic development.    Promoting information services and integrating them with  industrialization will greatly enhance the quality of China's  national economy and will help change the economy from an  extensive one to an efficient one. China's current economy is  still in a high-consumption, low-efficiency, and extensive  pattern of development. Energy consumption and material  consumption per unit of output value are three to five times  that of developed countries, the energy utilization rate is 30  percent, and its total personnel labor productivity is merely  some 5 percent that of developed countries. Fully developing  and utilizing information resources and information technology,  and putting economic development onto the track of relying on  technological progress can greatly enhance the utilization rate  of material resources and exceedingly enhance the added value of  production and labor productivity, as well as bringing into full  play the role of "science and technology as a primary productive  force."    Promoting information services is an immediate task for  establishing and perfecting China's socialist market economy  system and improving macroscopic regulation and control. The  backwardness of China's information technology means makes it  impossible to promptly, accurately, and completely collect,  transmit, and comprehensively process various kinds of economic  information, including information for banking, finance,  revenue, foreign trade, domestic trade, and industrial and  agricultural production. This seriously hinders the State  Council and governments at all levels in promptly making  macroscopic policy decisions and carrying out effective  macroscopic regulation and control, and causes difficulties for  China in its international economic exchanges. The major  information system projects and the basic information facilities  which leaders of the State Council are personally in charge of  are intended to resolve this salient contradiction at an early  date.    Promoting information services and accelerating the  development of the information industry will promote the  modernization of China's industrial structure and of the entire  national economy. Today, social and economic development  increasingly depends on information resources, information  technology, and the information industry. The information  industry is a leading industry for the modern economy. Its  importance is reflected not only by its daily increasing output  value in the national economy, but all the more by its  "invigorating," "arousing," and "doubling" effects on the entire  national economy. It has become the driving force for the rapid  growth of the modern national economy.    Promoting information services will be conducive to the  smooth linking of China's economy with that of the world.  Information services are becoming a major means of  international contact and trade exchanges. All big companies in  developed countries have extensively adopted the use of  electronic data exchange and electronic mail. Europe and the  United States already have employed electronic means for  international trade. If China does not accelerate the process  of promoting information services, it will directly affect the  depth and breadth of the opening up to the outside world and  will weaken China's role in the world economy.    II. Insist on the Integration of Production With  Application and of Manufacturing Industries With the Information  Service Industry, and Develop the Information Industry in an  All-Round Way, Thus Offering Information Services for the  National Economy    The electronics industry shoulders a heavy historical task  in  the process of promoting information services. In China, the  electronics industry already has become a new industry of some  proportions, and is playing an increasingly important role in  the modernization drive and in supplying information to society.  In 1993, the total industrial output value of China's  electronics industry came to 175 billion yuan, and electronic  products exports reached $8.1 billion. In the past decade, the  principle of "insisting on application and promoting  development" has been coordinated closely with all sectors of  the national economy, with the result that China has obtained  remarkable achievements in the application of electronic  information technology. Over the past year, for the several  major information projects -- especially the "Three Golden  Projects" -- we have made general plans, evaluated proposals,  and designed their development, and we have made a gratifying  step by putting some of them into practice. The general scale  and technology of China's information industry, however, are far  from meeting the demand for information services. China has  very low expertise in the electronics industry and is  particularly weak in the integrated circuit industry, which has  become a factor restricting the development of the entire  electronics industry. At present, there exists a certain degree  of separation between the industry and the market, as well as a  lack of coordination between technology imports and scientific  research and development. This situation, coupled with the  problems with the mechanism, makes it difficult to concentrate  strength and capital or to set up large enterprise groups.    At present, China's electronic information industry has  entered a crucial historical period of development, and is faced  with an unprecedentedly good opportunity and tough challenges.  Leading comrades of the State Council have pointed out clearly:  "In organizational reform, the State Council has decided to set  up the Ministry of Electronics Industry. Although its name  remains the same as previously, its tasks are greatly different  from the past. The goal of setting up the Ministry of  Electronics Industry this time is to strengthen the management  of the electronics industry across the country under the new  circumstances. The Ministry of Electronics Industry is the arm  of the State Council that carries out macroscopic management of  the electronics industry across the country." It also added:  "We take the entire information industry as a pillar industry  for the modernization of the national economy, and we have set  higher demands and expectations. The tasks with which we have  charged the Ministry of Electronics Industry are not only to  produce and manufacture products, but also to attach great  importance to hardware and the market and to promote applied  electronic technology. We must seize the opportunity to  accelerate development."    The electronics industry must be aimed at providing services  to the national economy and society, must continue adhering to  the principle of integrating production and application, and  must promote the all-round coordinated development of  manufacturing industries, information systems, and information  services. The focal point of development should be based on  microelectronics, and we should take communications and  computers as the mainstay, strengthen system integration and  software-development capability, and offer better full sets of  electronic system equipment and technological services for the  development of the national economy and society. It is now  necessary to concentrate energies on the development of  electronic information system projects, the emphasis of which is  on the "Three Golden Projects."    The "Golden Bridge Project," which is the State's public  economic information communication network project, is one of  the basic facilities for providing economic and social  information services. It is mutually linked and mutually  connected with the communication lines of the Ministry of Post  and Telecommunications and with the special communication  networks of other ministries. The "Golden Bridge" network can  transmit data, documents, sound, and diagrams. It will serve as  a satellite information channel for various information service  systems, including banking, customs, foreign trade, domestic  trade, tourism, meteorology, communications, national security,  and science and technology. It can offer a virtual subnetwork  for all sectors that intend to set up satellite  telecommunications networks, reduce duplicate projects, and save  funds.    The "Golden Pass Project" is a preliminary project of the  "Golden Bridge Project." It will contribute to the service  system networks of the customs, foreign trade, foreign exchange  control, and taxation enterprises and departments; promote the  electronic data exchange service and the electronic mail  service; and achieve the automation of pass control and  paperless trade.    The "Golden Card Project," which is the electronic currency  project, will serve banks and related sectors. It will use the  "Golden Bridge" network to link and perfect the information  systems of the banking service. It will promote the use of  credit and cash cards for banks, and gradually will achieve  electronic cash deposit and exchange, and electronic cash  payment; reduce the amount of cash people carry with them; and  offer them convenience. It also will make people lead a more  convenient and more comfortable life, and gradually will promote  various electronic value-added services to meet the needs of  society, as well as offering a reliable communication network.    In order to accelerate the implementation of the "Three  Golden Projects," the Ministry of Electronics Industry should  proceed from the demand of customers, serve customers,  coordinate with the departments concerned, strengthen  organization and leadership, improve overall planning, further  formulate general technological plans for projects, and  positively carry out experiments.    When it has gained  experience, it gradually should promote its experience, and then  must formulate industrial policies, organize related enterprises  and research academies to carry out scientific research and  development and large-scale production, offer system equipment  and services for the "Three Golden Projects," develop China's  large enterprise groups, and enhance the national strength in  the course of promoting information services.  <H5>  III. Under the Unified Leadership and Planning of the State </H5> Council and With the Close Coordination and Concerted Efforts of  All Ministries, Commissions, and Localities, We Will Jointly  Promote Economic and Social Information Services    Strengthening the national will and bringing into play the  government's functions of organization and of planning and  coordination are an important guarantee for promoting  information services. The national economic information service  is a grand social project that cuts across departments, trades,  and regions, and straddles the next century. It integrates a  multitude of technologies and a multitude of trades and  services. Only when we make unified plans, give unified  commands, unify the pace, properly coordinate relationships  among all quarters, bring into play the initiative of the center  and localities and of related departments and enterprises, share  a division of labor, and make concerted efforts under the strong  leadership of the State Council can we successfully implement  them. We must actively and energetically coordinate and  harmonize with the departments concerned, and assist the State  Council in offering good service.    In promoting information services, we must begin by setting  standards and standardizing policies, and must do good work in  standardization and legislation. Promoting information services  includes the development of basic facilities that serve as  information channels, and the development of various applied  information systems. Its huge efficiency lies in the fact that  the various applied information systems are mutually linked and  connected through the public information channel, thus fully  exploiting and utilizing information resources and achieving the  common use of resources. If we roughly compare basic  communication facilities to an "expressway," then the various  applied information systems are the cars running on the  expressway. Therefore, we must set technological standards and  agreements for the development of the state's public information  network, special information networks, and the various applied  information systems, including all types of equipment and  software. The information systems to be set up by all trades  and units must be open, while at the same time guaranteeing the  confidentiality of secret information. Therefore, promoting  information services not only requires the development and  application of advanced electronic technology, but also requires  reform of the patterns of operation and the management system  accordingly, as well as standardized government, enterprise, and  market behavior. Only by means of strong and effective policies  and laws can we guarantee the orderly promotion of information  services.    When promoting information services, we must insist on  opening up wider and on strengthening cooperation and exchanges  with the outside world. Promoting information services is a  common choice and great trend for the economic and social  development of all countries around the world. The development  of the state's basic economic information facilities must  guarantee international links and adopt common standards.  Developed countries already have gone a fairly long way in the  development of information technology, the information industry,  and in the promotion of information services. Now they are  developing into high-degree information societies. We can use  for reference and utilize the technology, experience, personnel,  management, and capital from around the world, and accelerate  the development of China's information industry and information  services through cooperation and exchanges.    In short, we should seize the opportunity to accelerate the  development of the electronics industry, and should positively  and actively improve service while accelerating economic  development and promoting information services. This is both an  unshirkable task of the electronics industry and a rare  opportunity for the electronic industry as a leading and pillar  industry to fully play its role. We must adhere to making demand  our objective and service our aim, change functions, and change  ways of thinking and work style. We should seize the  opportunity to accelerate development and make great efforts to  further upgrade the technological expertise and efficiency of  the electronics industry.</p>

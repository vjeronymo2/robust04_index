			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Jeyes shares drop 28% on trading warning SHARES IN Jeyes plunged 28 per cent yesterday after the cleaning products group said current trading was substantially below market expectations and revealed greater than expected reorganisation costs. The shares fell 122p to 317p, some 68p below last July's rights issue price that took the group into continental Europe and nearly doubled sales. The profits warning is a severe set-back for Jeyes which floated in 1988 two years after a trend setting management buy-out from Cadbury Schweppes and had since won a heady stock market rating. Mr Jimmy Moir, chief executive, said operating margins in the UK, the group's largest market with 45 per cent of sales, had fallen from 8 per cent to 3 per cent in the first half. Margins had been hit because a sharp increase in promotional spending designed to gain market share had coincided with a period of zero price inflation. Market shares had increased sharply in hygiene wipes and bleach but all the reduction in margin had been felt directly on the bottom line, Mr Moir said. Exports were 18 per cent below where the group had anticipated they would be. Jeyes also made a Pounds 600,000 provision to reduce the size its management overhead following the Globol acquisition in Germany. While the group was expecting to have to reorganise the manufacturing plant, it had not anticipated the cost of reorganising the management. German sales, margins and operating profits from Globol were ahead of plan and last year's levels. Overall, the group would be Pounds 2m short of the expected level of pre-tax profits in the first half. Mr Moir said he remained confident that the second half would be in line with expectations. 'In many ways the forward view is not bleak,' he said. 'None of the benefits (of the reorganisation) have been felt in first half.' Market share would be much higher in the second half without some of the cost of achieving higher sales. But lower interim profits meant the pre-tax outcome for the full year would be 'well below market expectations', he said.</p>

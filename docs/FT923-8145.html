			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Japan Rumours that the Japanese Ministry of Finance would allow banks to avoid disclosing losses on stocks were quickly denied yesterday, but the markets believe there is something to the story. Remarkably, bank shares were marked up despite the fall in the stock market, although the rise was small. Even in Europe, deferring the day of reckoning by six or 12 months might occasion a little rejoicing. Nor are UK investors immune from swallowing tall accounting tales. That said, Japanese investors must know that no amount of balance sheet magic can alter the awful stock and property losses facing the banks. The pain of asset deflation will not be soothed by jiggery-pokery.</p>

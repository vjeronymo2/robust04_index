			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "NEGA Reports" rubric] </F>   [Text] An acute shortage of cash and a big backlog of  salaries, pensions, benefits, and allowances are forcing the  Dniester leaders to turn to the Russian Federation Court of  Arbitration. The ruling it adopted back on 18 January 1993  found in favor of the action brought by the Dniester Regional  Bank against the Moscow Goznak printing factory. The latter was  requested to carry out its obligation to ship the Dniester money  coupons manufactured by it in accordance with a paid order.    The introduction of Dniester money coupons is regarded as a  temporary and purely economic measure helping to stabilize the  position with cash until a general agreement with Moldova has  been reached, Grigoriy Marakutsa, chairman of the Supreme Soviet  of the unrecognized Dniester Moldovan Republic, explained to a  NEGA correspondent. Its implementation, however, has been  stopped by Russia -- not without some pressure from Chisinau  officials, informed sources say.    The 24 May session of the Supreme Soviet of the Dniester  Moldovan Republic that discussed the debts problem adopted an  appeal to the Russian president, the Federation Council, and the  State Duma with a request to positively resolve the question  decided long ago by the Russian Federation Court of Arbitration.</p>

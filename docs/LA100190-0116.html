			<p><P> October 1, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 4.7 MILLION ISRAELIS TO RECEIVE GAS MASKS  </P> <P> The army announced today that it will begin distributing gas masks to Israel's  4.7 million citizens next week following reports of an increased threat of war  in the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> The announcement follows repeated threats by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to  attack Israel, including one in which he said he would burn half the Jewish  state with binary chemical weapons.  </P> <P> The announcement's wording sought to allay any public fear.  </P> <P> "The distribution of gas masks in no way whatsoever constitutes a change in the  emergency status," it said.  </P> <P> The distribution of the masks follows months of heated debate in which the  public -- and some officials -- have said it was foolish to delay giving out  the protective equipment.  </P> <P> Until today, officials had maintained that an immediate distribution of gas  masks could panic the Israeli public or send Iraq an incorrect message that  Israel was planning an attack.  </P> <P> Army spokesman Brig. Gen. Nachman Shai said distribution of the sealed gas mask  kits "will take several weeks. . . . We will start in the city sector . . . and  gradually get to rural areas."  </P> <P> "Defense authorities have sufficient kits for all citizens of Israel," the army  announcement said.  </P> <P> It added that the government also has begun purchasing gas masks for the 1.7  million Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.  </P> <P> Shai, in answering questions on the distribution on Israel television,  maintained that the plan for supplying gas masks was developed long before the  gulf crisis.  </P> <P> While the government has been debating, civil defense officials have several  times spoken on the radio on "home remedies" against gas attacks.  </P> <P> The home remedies include sealing windows with tape and soaking towels in  baking soda and water for a homemade gas mask.  </P></p>

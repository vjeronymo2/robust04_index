			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PORT OKS UNOCAL PACT TO RELOCATE TANK FARM  </P> <P> A decade-long battle between San Pedro residents and Unocal came to a close  Wednesday when the Los Angeles Board of Harbor Commissioners approved an  agreement that requires the oil company to dismantle its tank farm within five  years.  </P> <P> Unocal's San Pedro tank farm, on 22nd Street between a residential neighborhood  and the new Cabrillo Marina, has long been criticized by residents who say it  is a hazard to their homes.  </P> <P> The tank farm, which can hold up to 2 million barrels of crude oil, is used to  store oil from tankers until it is needed at the company's refinery in  Wilmington, on Anaheim Street near the Harbor Freeway.  </P> <P> Neighbors have been complaining about the tank farm since 1976, when the oil  tanker Sansinena blew up while it was loading fuel at Unocal's Miner Street  terminal, not far from the tank farm. The explosion killed nine people and  caused $21.6 million in damage.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Flores Joined Critics  </P> <P> Los Angeles Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores -- who has been credited by  residents and port officials for orchestrating Wednesday's agreement -- joined  the critics in 1981, as soon as she was elected.  </P> <P> "We're very excited, very pleased," Flores' harbor deputy, Ann D'Amato, said at  the commission meeting Wednesday. "It's been a long haul, though."  </P> <P> Unocal, which has to absorb costs of as much as $50 million to relocate the  tanks, is also backing the agreement, but a company official did not seem  nearly as elated about it as D'Amato.  </P> <P> "We're as satisfied as we can be, I think," said Nat F. Chavira, Unocal general  counsel.  </P> <P> Chavira said company officials have not yet picked a site for the relocated  tanks. He added, however, that the Unocal refinery is a strong possibility.  Once a site is found, the company will build a pipeline to the new tank farm  from the Unocal tanker terminal.  </P> <P> Under the agreement approved Wednesday:  </P> <P> The Harbor Department and Unocal will sign a "phase-out" lease to extend the  oil company's current lease, which expired last July, to July, 1993. By then,  the company must dismantle its tanks and restore the tank-farm site to its  original condition. This includes removing any contamination that may have  resulted from the tanks.  </P> <P> Flores, the Harbor Department and the residents will not oppose the company's  plans to build a pipeline to the relocated tanks.  </P> <P> Unocal's lease for the Miner Street terminal will be extended for another 30  years, giving the company a valuable long-term commitment for that site. If,  however, a so-called "energy island" for tanks and other hazardous facilities  is completed within 20 years, the port has the right under the agreement to  relocate Unocal there.  </P> <P> This provision is an attempt to coordinate long-range plans for the energy  island, announced by the Harbor Department in 1987, with the more immediate  need to rid San Pedro of the Unocal tanks. The Harbor Department had initially  planned to move the tanks to the island -- to be built by filling in part of  the outer harbor -- when it is ready. But residents and Flores complained that  such a relocation could take 10 years or more.  </P> <P> During Wednesday's meeting, Harbor Commission President Ira Distenfield  acknowledged that community activists and Flores, who became involved in  negotiations when the company's lease for the 22nd Street tank farm expired,  had pushed the port into supporting the agreement.  </P> <P> However, Distenfield said, the plan is a good example of how the port can  resolve the "natural conflicts" between its industrial tenants and nearby  residents.  </P> <P> "We can achieve our purpose and do it with community concerns in mind," said  Distenfield. "We all end up winners for this."  </P></p>

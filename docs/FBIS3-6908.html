			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Warren Fernande and Brendan Pereira] </F>   [Text] Defence lawyer Michael Khoo yesterday rejected a  suggestion by the prosecution that his client had admitted  communicating secret information to a BUSINESS TIMES [BT]  reporter.    Such a suggestion was based on a selective reading of  statements by Crosby Securities analyst, Manu Bhaskaran, to the  Internal Security Department, he said on day 37 of the Official  Secrets Act trial.    He was referring to the prosecution's written submissions  which had mentioned Bhaskaran's "admission of a direct  communication of the flash estimate" to BT journalist Kenneth  James.    Mr. Khoo described this as a "phantom admission", saying it  did not exist in his client's statements.    Bhaskaran, he noted, had told James that he came arross the  4.6 percent figure inadvertently and did not know it was the  official flash estimate.    He had doubts about it because he thought the figure was too  low.    This did not amount to an admission that he had communicated  official data, Mr. Khoo argued.    Attorney-General Chan Sek Beong countered that the lawyer  had  taken his submission out of context.    The prosecution's argument was that whatever Bhaskaran now  said, he had sighted the 4.6 percent figure, which turned out to  be the official flash estimate.    Mr. Khoo replied: "It may well be that the 4.6 figure was  the  flash estimate. But my client is not charged with having made a  good guess of what it was, but with communicating it. The fact  that it turned out to be the flash estimate is irrelevant."    Bhaskaran faces one charge of receiving the official flash  estimate and two of communicating it.    Continuing his submission yesterday, Mr. Khoo said there  were  other instances in which the prosecution had relied on parts of  his client's statements, while ignoring others. This was wholly  untenable, he said, urging the court to read the statements in  in context.    He also maintained that the prosecution had failed to  produce  evidence to prove that Bhaskaran was BT's source of the data.    The information was widely known among BT staffers and could  have come from elsewhere, he said.    James could have been mistaken when he told a colleague that  Bhaskaran was his source. He had told Bhaskaran that he woke up  one night with the thought that the analyst "was not the one",  the lawyer noted.    Besides, noted Mr. Khoo, Bhaskaran is alleged to have told  James about the flash estimate for the overall economy only.    But, after speaking with one of its reporters, chief  statistician Paul Cheung had concluded that BT knew about the  growth figures for various sectors of the economy as well.    It was possible some other source, and not Bhaskaran, had  leaked both the sectoral figures and the official flash estimate  to BT, he said.    BT correspondent Anna Teo had also told Mr. Lai Seck Khui,  the deputy secretary of the Ministry of Trade and Industry, that  BT had obtained the information from government sources, he  added.    The prosecution is expected to respond to his submissions  later this week.</p>

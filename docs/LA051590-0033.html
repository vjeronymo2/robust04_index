			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BUGGED BY WATER ISSUE  </P> <P> Regarding water conservation. The people are asked to cut back on our water  usage, which we do, and as a result, we save a certain percentage of water from  our efforts.  </P> <P> But when people OK new housing and continue to allow more and more new homes to  be built, all that we conserve then goes to these new homes. Where is the logic  in this?  </P> <P> Sooner or later the building will have to stop because there just will not be  enough water, no matter how much we conserve. I hope someone opens their eyes  to this obvious future problem.  </P> <P> YVONNE AUMILLER  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

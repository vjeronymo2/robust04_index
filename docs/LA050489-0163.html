			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-OXNARD COLLEGE CHIEF APPOINTED TO RUN MUSEUM  </P> <P> Ed Robings, who retired last year as president of Oxnard College, has been  appointed executive director of the Ventura County Museum of Art and History.  </P> <P> He announced this week that he will resign as director of Oxnard's World Trade  Center, which promotes international trade in Ventura County.  </P> <P> "There is hardly anything I would have left the Trade Center for," said  Robings, 60, "and the Ventura County Museum of Art and History is one of those  things."  </P> <P> Robings will fill the post vacated last August when Keith Foster resigned to  become director of the Redding Museum and Art Center. The Ventura museum's  acting director, Frances Johnson-Pietro, will return to her job as curator of  exhibits.  </P> <P> Museum officials said they were impressed with the credentials of Robings, a  gregarious man with a booming voice who retired from Oxnard College after seven  years as president.  </P> <P> He has been president of the Oxnard Chamber of Commerce and has been active in  community organizations and events ranging from United Way to the Strawberry  Festival. In November, he unsuccessfully ran for the Oxnard City Council.  </P> <P> "He has managerial skills," said Dorcas H. Thille, museum board president. "And  we felt we needed a manager."  </P> <P> Museum officials hope that Robings, who begins work May 15, will increase  Oxnard's participation in the museum, which is more closely associated with  Ventura city history than with other county areas. "In fact, it's a countywide  museum," Thille said.  </P> <P> The Trade Center's board of directors plans to meet tomorrow to discuss  replacing Robings, said Nao Takasugi, center president and Oxnard mayor.  </P> <P> Robings has been on the executive board of the Ventura County Museum of History  and Art since October. His wife Joan has served as a museum docent since 1981.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE POSSIBLE CLOSURE OF STATE'S JOPLIN YOUTH CENTER IN COUNTY  </P> <P> "Hopping mad" under-describes my reaction to the possible closing of the Joplin  Youth Center reported in your article (April 23). Before Gov. George Deukmejian  and Supervisor Tom Riley continue to press for this unwarranted action, they  should read a Los Angeles Times article (March 31) on the role Saddleback  Kiwanis Club plays in helping to turn the Joplin boys around.  </P> <P> Riley is quoted as saying: "I don't see how we could come up with the money . .  . now." This is nonsense! Riley implies that he has other priorities. One can  easily agree that a need exists to cut government spending. One can further  agree that there are legitimate concerns about society and its will to get a  handle on crime, delinquency and drug abuse before the fabric which holds it  together comes apart.  </P> <P> But solutions require priorities where they count most, where government funds  have a reasonable chance to turn children and youth into productive and  law-abiding citizens.  </P> <P> NORMAN WILLIAM FREESTONE  </P> <P> Laguna Hills  </P></p>

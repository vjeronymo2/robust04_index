			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] Since mid-May, the Vietnamese side has sent  exploratory vessels to the Wan An Reef area of China's Nansha  [Spratly] marine area to carry out geophysical operations.  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang today issued a  statement on this.    The statement says: As is known to all, China has  indisputable sovereignty over the Nansha Islands and their  adjacent waters, and the Wan An Reef is part of the Nansha  Islands. In recent years, Vietnam has demarcated certain blocks  in this area for external bidding and has on many occasions  harassed the normal scientific survey and fishing activities of  Chinese vessels. Now it has moved into this area for oil and  gas prospecting and development. It must be pointed out that  these moves have seriously violated China's sovereignty over the  Nansha Islands and have also put the Wab-21 petroleum contract  signed between the China National Offshore Oil Corporation and  the Crestone Energy Corporation of the United States, which  covers this area, in serious jeopardy. The Chinese side has  made solemn representations on many occasions to the Vietnamese  side over its acts of violating China's sovereignty in the  Nanshas. The Chinese Government demands once again that the  Vietnamese Government, in proceeding from the overall interests  of maintaining and developing bilateral relations and preserving  peace and stability in the region, stop the aforementioned acts  of infringement upon China's sovereignty.    Shen Guofang also announced: Vice President Joseph Estrada  of the Republic of the Philippines will pay an official visit to  China from 18 to 25 June at the invitation of Chinese Vice  President Rong Yiren. A delegation of the Supreme Soviet of the  Republic of Tajikistan will pay an official goodwill visit to  China from 21 to 28 June, as guests of China's National People's  Congress Standing Committee.    Shen Guofang also answered questions raised by reporters on  the Korean nuclear issue, Sino-British relations, and the Hong  Kong issue.</p>

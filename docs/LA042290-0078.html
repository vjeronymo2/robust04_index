			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGEWOOD SHELTER'S COUNSELORS  </P> <P> We, as former Orangewood Children's Home counselors, are writing in regard to  the article written about Orangewood and the alleged abuse occurring there. We  are concerned that the article presented a biased viewpoint and that the  general public, knowing little of the day-to-day operation of Orangewood, will  have a negative image brought to mind each time Orangewood is mentioned.  </P> <P> Of equal importance is that we personally were hurt by the article. It must be  understood that working at Orangewood is not a typical 9-to-5 job. To work at  Orangewood is to open your heart and your life to care for hurting and abused  children. When your day is over and you go home, you are not finished working;  you worry about the children. Their problems become your problems. Their fears  become your fears. And the next day you go back with love, dedication and hope  to guide you through another day in making a difference in a child's life.  </P> <P> Each day the group counselors strive to be there for the children. Field trips  are continuously being taken. Counselors frequently take their own time after  work to take children to the mall or to dinner to give them special one-on-one  attention. During the holidays, many children who are not able to spend the day  with their families are taken out of Orangewood to spend the day with a  counselor and their family. These are dedicated individuals whose first  priority is the children.  </P> <P> We hold the highest regard and respect for the group counselors at Orangewood.  Their job is a most difficult one. We left Orangewood feeling proud of the work  we did there and will continue to support the outstanding achievements of the  counselors. We hope those who read the article will keep in mind that what was  represented was one viewpoint and there are so many more of us who feel that  our work at Orangewood is building self-esteem, providing crisis intervention,  healing the hurts, and loving the children as our own.  </P> <P> LAURIE HENDRON  </P> <P> Orange  </P> <P> This letter was also signed by three other former Orangewood counselors.  </P> <P> </P></p>

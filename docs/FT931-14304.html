			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Government Bonds: Tap sales raise record Fl 9bn for 10-year Dutch paper EUROPE'S higher-yielding government bond markets showed strong gains as perceived tensions within the European exchange rate mechanism subsided, sparking hopes of cuts in short-term interest rates. Among the hard-core European bond markets, the Netherlands outperformed Germany which was held back by comments from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank deputy president, that inflation in Germany is still too high. THE Dutch bond market saw strong demand from domestic institutions for the new 7 per cent state bond due 2003, the first 10-year bond to be issued since last June. Towards the close of trading, the Finance Ministry said tap sales for the new bond raised a record Fl 8.9bn, the biggest amount raised in a single day since the ministry introduced tap sales in 1990 to issue debt. Dealers initially estimated the ministry was seeking to raise a total of Fl 10bn, but some traders said they believed the amount could be increased given the strong demand. The price of the tap issue was raised five times, ending the day up 32 basis points at 99.55 to yield 7.06 per cent. The strong demand for the bond resulted in a narrowing of the yield spread between Dutch and German paper by 3 basis points to around 3 1/2 basis points. DANISH government bonds rallied yesterday, helped by the combination of favourable signs on the political front, an opinion poll predicting a 'yes' vote in the forthcoming referendum on Maastricht and hopes of an easing in money market rates. Dealers said a shortage of sellers also pushed up prices and some offers by the central bank throughout the day were not enough to satisfy demand. The 8 per cent government bond due 2003 closed at 97.00, up from 95 1/4 on Friday. FUNDING worries continued to plague the UK government bond market, with long-dated gilts losing nearly half a point. The Bank of England is due to announce today the details of the gilt auction scheduled for January 27. Dealers are expecting the Bank to auction as much as Pounds 3bn of stock, with the 8 1/2 per cent gilt due 2007 emerging as a likely candidate. The Liffe gilt future contract fell from 99.28 at the opening to trade at 99.22 by late afternoon. In the cash market, short-dated gilts ended little changed while long-dated bonds fell, leading to a steepening of the yield curve. The 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 fell from 119 3/16 to 118 3/4 by late afternoon. FRENCH government bonds continued their new year rally, thanks to a continued recovery in the franc. The 8 1/2 per cent OAT due 2003 ended up 0.38 at 105.03 to yield 7.76 per cent while on the Matif, the Paris futures exchange, the March bond futures contract closed at 113.64, up 0.20 from late Friday. JAPANESE government bond prices rallied to reach their highest levels in nearly five years, boosted by government purchases of 10-year and 20-year government bonds in the secondary market. The yield on the No. 145 10-year benchmark bond fell to 4.345 per cent yesterday, dipping below 4.4 per cent for the first time since April 1988. Until now, the government has bought bonds through private placements rather than in the secondary market. The Bank of Japan bought Y100bn worth of bonds yesterday on behalf of the Ministry of Finance's trust fund bureau, which invests public funds such as postal savings in financial markets. An official at the trust fund bureau said the move was designed to diversify its investments. The decision, however, comes at a time when a sharp rise in postal savings is causing some concern among policy makers. The postal savings system, which offers higher yields than the country's banks, saw an inflow of some Y12,300bn, fuelling complaints from the banks. Meanwhile, a fall in long-term market rates is expected to prompt long-term credit banks to lower their prime lending rates to corporations, increasing the amount of funds available to companies. The Ministry of Finance plans a Y100bn purchase of government bonds every month. THE New York Treasury market was closed yesterday for the Martin Luther King holiday.</p>

			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / World Trade News: Caricom slow to put common into market - Agreed uniform external tariffs look like being held up a year THE EFFORTS of the Caribbean Economic Community (Caricom) to create a customs union are being set back by reservations by some member governments over the impact of a new common external tariff. The new tariff should have been implemented by all 13 members at the start of this year. In the event, several were unable to meet the deadline, with trade ministers saying they were concerned about the impact on national economies. Government officials and representatives of the Community's secretariat appear confident that the common tariff will be in place by the end of this year. They suggested that, despite the delay, the implementation of the common tariff would be significant for the Community, not least because it was written into the treaty establishing Caricom 18 years ago. While the Community is moving with equal uncertainty towards the reduction of barriers to trade among its members - the aim is to have a common market in place by 1993 and monetary union the following year - the level of success with which the common external tariff is implemented could determine the viability of any attempt to increase economic integration. Efforts at integration have been bedevilled by parochial concerns and the tendency of some governments to implement significant changes in economic policy without consulting partners. 'We have to get our act together in view of what is happening in Europe and other parts of the world,' said Mr John Compton, prime minister of St Lucia. 'All of these things show we must have a common market, and we must have the common external tariff.' The community is made up of the English-speaking countries in the region, including Belize in central America and Guyana in South America. It has a combined market of 5.5m people. All members, except the Bahamas which is not a signatory of the trading agreements, have said they will implement the common tariff. The proposed tariff structure promises low rates of duty on imports which do not compete with goods produced within the community, but sets high rates on any imports likely to injure domestic industry. Under the new tariff the highest rate of duty will be 45 per cent and the lowest 5 per cent. This replaces a structure where tariffs range from 5 per cent to 70 per cent. The new measures will streamline the three different tariff structures used in the community. Rates will differ where imports are raw materials or finished products, and agricultural products will be given protection while inputs for agriculture will be subject to low tariffs. 'There is need for the common external tariff to stimulate production in the community,' said Mr Hayden Blades, director of trade and agriculture for the Community secretariat. 'But the tariff structure must not encourage inefficient production. The tariffs have to be set at levels which will allow regional industry to be competitive,' he said. In effect, however, most of the smaller Community members, in particular the smaller islands of the eastern Caribbean, and Belize on mainland central America, will have to raise their import duties, while the more developed countries (Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados and Guyana) will be lowering theirs. This has led some government officials in the smaller states to be concerned about the inflationary impact of the common tariff. Mr Charles Maynard, trade minister of Dominica, says the the new arrangements will have to be constantly monitored to determine the impact on the cost of living 'so we can decide, at the level of the Community's Ministerial Council whether we need to revise it upwards of downwards'. Several governments have become dependent on revenues from import duties, and have moved to cushion the expected loss of income with the lowering of tariffs. The Jamaican government has imposed a sales tax on some imports on which duties have been reduced. The new tariff offers greater protection to the fledgling industries of the smaller community members, while presenting increased competition to businesses in the larger countries. The community's industrial sector is based on light manufacturing and the assembly and re-export of consumer durables. The changes caused by the new arrangements have unsettled some manufacturers. Mr Anthony Robinson, president of the Jamaica Manufacturers Association, has complained that the implementation of the common external tariff has exacerbated differences in the level of competitiveness among the Caribbean Community members. Mr Robinson said Jamaican manufacturers may be forced to close or reduce operations because '. . . our Community competitors pay no duty on raw materials, and having made the products, ship them here at between 14 per cent and 21 per cent less than it costs Jamaican manufacturers to ship products to other parts of the Community.' Mr Compton argued that the Caribbean Community has no option but to implement measures such as the common external tariff. 'It will take some sacrifice, there might be short-term adjustments and we must be prepared to bear these sacrifices if the Caribbean is to adjust itself economically to meet the challenges of the outside world.'</p>

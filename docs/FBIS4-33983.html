			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 13 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Today, the Cuban Foreign  Ministry confirmed a group of people's forceful entry into the  German Embassy in Havana and described the action as an "obvious  provocation."    Miguel Alfonso, official spokesman of the Cuban Foreign  Ministry, has told NOTIMEX: "We want to point out that this  action has taken place on the very day the president of Mexico  arrives in Havana and on the eve of the 4th Ibero-American  summit."    The spokesman said the forceful entry of these people into  the German Embassy "is additional evidence of the harmful  results of the U.S. policy" of denying visas to those who  request visas at the U.S. Interests Office here.</p>

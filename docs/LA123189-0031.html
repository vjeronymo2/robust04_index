			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIPS ON MANAGING LOSS FROM FIRE  </P> <P> Here are some more tips on managing your loss after a fire:  </P> <P>  -- To simplify record-keeping, use separate credit cards for additional living  expenses and for contents purchases. Also consider opening a separate checking  account into which only insurance company checks are deposited and from which  only checks for repairs and replacement purchases are drawn.  </P> <P>  -- Be selective about the clothes you dry clean. Some may be too old to  warrant the expense. Wash smoke-stained sheets with ammonia added to the wash  water. They will make handy furniture covers during debris removal and  reconstruction.  </P> <P>  -- Avoid carte blanche arrangements with tradespeople; wherever possible  obtain estimates and bids.  </P> <P>  -- Consider renting local public storage space to store undamaged contents, as  well as cleaned items as they are returned before reconstruction is completed.  </P> <P>  -- Large 22-by-22-by-50-inch wardrobe storage boxes are available from moving  companies. They're handy for storing unneeded clothes.  </P></p>

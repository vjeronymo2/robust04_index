			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Javier Rodriguez] </F>   [Text] Havana, 25 Feb (PL) -- Cuban Foreign Minister  Roberto Robaina said today in this capital that the holding of a  conference with representatives of Cuban emigrants will take  away from the United States the banner it has traditionally  brandished against Cuba.    During a conversation with Mexican legislators visiting the  Caribbean island -- a conversation to which PRENSA LATINA had  access -- the foreign minister said this fact is the first  achievement of the preparations now under way for the meeting  scheduled for April.    We are reaching out a hand and a bridge to those who want to  maintain normal relations with our country, and those who say  they have nothing to talk to us about have excluded themselves,  he added.    Answering questions from the visitors, Robaina said the idea  behind the conference is to speak to people who are living  abroad for different reasons, and he noted that family ties  cannot be broken because of ideological positions.    Among the opportunities presented by the conference, the  minister noted possible academic exchanges, the possible  granting of scholarships to emigrants wishing to study in Cuba,  and the editing of publications for Cubans living abroad.    Robaina also said paperwork for entering and leaving Cuba  could be facilitated, because "the time has come to change rigid  rules" that have always been prompted by the aggressive attitude  of certain sectors now trying to exert pressure once again to  discourage attendance at the conference.    We believe normal relations with Cuban emigrants constitute  one of the elements that can help change U.S. Government policy  so that the pressure from those inciting violence against Cuba  will cease to exist, as well as the pressure exerted on those  who are opposed to the hysteria, he noted.    Robaina said different conditions exist today, and this is  why the emigrants have already said they want to attend the  conference and talk about a future of acceptable ties with their  country of origin.</p>

			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: One for the books - Directors' transactions One of the week's largest sales took place at Sterling Publishing, a book company, where Michael Preston, the non-executive deputy chairman, sold more than 497,000 shares at 130p. While this wiped out his equity in the company, the disposal was made for personal financial reasons. Alphonsus Schouten, managing director of the European division of Laura Ashley, the fashion to fabrics company, sold 100,000 shares - all his ordinary stock - at 72p. The shares are trading at around 70p. The sale of 1.2m shares at Bluebird Toys comes only a month after CD Burgin bought stock. In the most recent transaction, chairman Torquil Norman raised Pounds 2.48m by selling more than half his holding at 207p. The shares were placed with institutions and Norman has undertaken not to sell any more stock for at least a year. The directors of Sheffield Insulation have been cautious in their transactions over the past year. The most recent deal was by non-executive chairman Norman Adsetts but still leaves him with more than 3.87m shares. The sale came shortly after the group had announced strong interim results and looks like a small profit-take.  ----------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------                                               Value        No of Company                Sector      Shares  Pounds 000s   directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Aerospace Eng             Eng      60,000        11          1 Ashley (Laura)           RetG     100,000        72          1 Bluebird Toys            L&amp;Hl   1,200,000     2,484          1 Drayton Far East         InvT     550,000       743          1 Faupel Trading           Text      30,000        22          1 Inspec Group             Chem     140,000       290          1 Macfarlane Group         PP&amp;P      42,000       108          1 Midlands Elec            Elec       7,400        52          1 Sheffield Insul Grp      BM&amp;M     200,000       490          1 South Wales Elec         Elec       4,800        37          2 Sterling Pub             Mdia     497,382       647          1 Unilever Grp             FdMa       1,000        11          1 Vardon                   L&amp;Hl     373,303       448          1 BAA                      Tran      33,500       155          1* Page (Michael) Grp       SSer      69,890        77          1* RTZ                      ExIn      39,752       345          1*  ----------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Anglo-East Plant         OS&amp;B     100,000        94          1 Arlen                    EE&amp;E     100,000        33          1 Ashley (Laura)           RetG      50,000        35          1 BWD Securities           OthF     100,000        81          1 Baltic                   OthF     862,898     1,010          1 Beazer Homes             BCon      20,000        25          1 Bradford Prop            Prop       9,660        18          2 British Gas              GasD      54,000       160          2 Claremont Garments       Text      15,000        44          1 Clayhithe PLC            OthF     105,000        76          3 Delaney                  HGod     455,000        36          1 First Technology          Eng       6,500        21          1 Hi-Tec Sports            L&amp;Hl      25,000        12          1 King &amp; Shaxson           OthF      22,500        24          3 London Forfaiting        OthF      50,000        79          1 P &amp; O                    Tran       2,846        18          1 Platignum                OS&amp;B     610,000        52          3 Secure Trust             OthF      17,500        84          1 Smith (David S)          PP&amp;P       5,000        26          1 TransTec                  Eng     106,000        56          2 Whatman                   Eng      21,000        84          1 Yorkshire Food           FdMa     175,000       188          1  -----------------------------------------------------------------  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Hurricane wakes US natural gas futures - The two-year-old NYMEX market has finally come of age WHEN Hurricane Andrew swept through one of the richest natural gas producing regions of the US in late August, disrupting production, it spawned another sort of tempest in the two-year-old natural gas futures pit at the New York Mercantile Exchange. Volume soared, prices climbed to successive contract highs, and every serious player in the natural gas market stayed within sight of their screen. Producers, sensing a bonanza, rushed to price output based on the futures gains, while utilities and industrial natural gas consumers used futures to lock in purchases before winter drove prices even higher. The scene would not have been unusual had it been set in the NYMEX's big crude oil ring. However, it signaled a rite of passage for the natural gas industry, where futures are a newcomer, and the gentlemanly practice of trading privately and with a handshake has until recently been the fashion. 'All this has happened in the last six months,' says Mr Mike Emerson, a trading analyst at New Jersey-based KCS Energy Risk Management. 'When natural gas futures first started, there were a lot of physicals people (gas traders) who were avoiding the screen. They said futures didn't have a lot to do with physicals prices. Now everyone is looking at the screen, quoting prices at a differential to futures.' Natural gas futures volume hit a daily record of 32,705 on September 23, and natural gas options - just opened at the NYMEX on October 2 - have had a respectable start-up volume of about 2,000 contracts per day. While small compared with more established US futures contracts, volume is growing steadily, traders say, and 'depth' in the pit has become sufficient to swallow large orders without disruptive price movement. What has happened, traders say, is that the gas market, after languishing since the mid-1980s, has been jolted by volatility. They say this demanded more efficient pricing and that the gradually maturing futures market was in place to meet that demand. Natural gas price volatility this year has rivaled that in crude oil and even foreign currencies, driving dealers to the protection offered by futures, options, and over-the-counter swaps. In January, at the end of a very warm winter, US gas users found themselves holding burdensome inventories, and futures prices for February delivery skidded to lows near Dollars 1.046 per million British thermal units. Cash prices followed. Six months later, the hurricane interrupted Louisiana Gulf deliveries while utilities' inventory levels were historically low and the winter heating season was just around the corner. NYMEX natural gas futures for October delivery soared to Dollars 2.743 per million Btu, a gain of more than 150 per cent from February. While the price disruptions from Hurricane Andrew are viewed as temporary, Richard Kalmas, manager of gas supply for Northern Illinois Public Service Co., which delivers gas to residential and commercial customers in the upper Midwest, says he isn't counting on gas prices easing until early spring. 'We have to buy gas with the anticipation that winter will be normal or colder than normal. Since our first concern is having a secure supply, we can't hope for a warm winter and hold back purchases hoping prices will go down,' he said. Since many utilities are in the same position, and since most are public service companies that can pass gas price increases through to their customers, supply concerns may continue to outweigh sobering price gains in purchasing decisions. Mr Guy Ausmus, senior energy buyer for Chicago-based Inland Steel, thinks the 'emotional' reaction of the futures market to the hurricane added 70 cents to natural gas prices, and he expects prices to level off by spring. Inland regularly uses the gas futures for price protection, and Mr Ausmus says the contract still has some growing to do to service an American market that consumes 53 billion cubic feet of gas per day. 'It has to grow, and this price run-up will do a lot to help it grow,' Mr Ausmus said of the futures. 'To the extent that it grows, especially now that (NYMEX) has added options trading, this market will become super efficient.'</p>

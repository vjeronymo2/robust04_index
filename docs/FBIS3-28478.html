The statement said:    The traitor Kim Yong-sam, a political charlatan and  impostor,  had once promised that he would "protect" the rice market by  staking his "presidency". But, throwing away this promise like  a pair of old shoes, he sold off the agricultural market vital  to the South Korean peasants and people to the U.S. masters and  is ruthlessly suppressing the struggle of students and farmers  to defend it. What can be expected from such a renegade of  democracy and traitor to the nation?    The present reality shows that, with the Kim Yong-sam puppet  clique left in power, the desire of the South Korean people and  students for independence, democracy and reunification cannot be  realised and their existence itself will be jeopardized.    The traitor Kim Yong-sam should step down before he meets a  miserable end, not forgetting what doom his predecessors met  while brandishing the bayonet at the people.    The statement called upon the South Korean students,  peasants  and other people to hold the flag of the patriotic struggle as  high as ever to overthrow the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, guard  the agricultural market and defend the dignity and interests of  the nation.</p>

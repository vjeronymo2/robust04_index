			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Government creating a PO problem Sir, Your report that ministers are 'determined' to go ahead with a 51 per cent share sale of Royal Mail and Parcelforce - thus breaking the link with Post Office Counters - must concern those who fear for the future of the nationwide network of post offices ('Ministers determined to sell Post Office stake', September 23). Nearly all informed opinion, including large mail users, has been that this preferred government option does not adequately respond to the needs of post office customers, who must have continued access to some 19,000 outlets nationwide. Central to this is a concern that separating the Post Office will allow Royal Mail to seek alternative outlets for its products. This will slowly drain Post Office Counters' income, which will in turn force the business to look closely at its 10,000 subsidised sub-post offices. We recently revealed Post Office projections of 1,050 sub-post office closures by 1999. The government has sought to generate enthusiasm for these plans by guaranteeing the automation of benefit payments in sub-post offices. Automation is welcomed and in urban areas will cut down on fraud and improve efficiency. What automation cannot do in rural areas is increase the number of customers who go into the local sub-office - there the number of transactions is certain to decline as Royal Mail plc moves further away from the separated counters business which it currently supports. The green paper deliberately avoids foresight and imagination. It concentrates on the issue of ownership when it should have proposed a unified Post Office with genuine commercial freedoms to meet the changing needs of customers. We, like most other interested organisations, have argued that ownership of the Post Office was never a problem - the government now intends to make it one.

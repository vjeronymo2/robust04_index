			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ALIENS URGED TO FINISH PROGRAM  </P> <P> Several immigration officials, joined by U.S. Immigration and Naturalization  Service Commissioner Alan C. Nelson, Tuesday issued yet another plea for  eligible aliens to complete educational requirements under the second phase of  the landmark national amnesty program.  </P> <P> If they do not, the aliens will become illegal again, the officials said at a  Los Angeles news conference. At present, about a third of the estimated 1  million illegals who signed up in greater Los Angeles during the amnesty  program's first phase have sought to complete the educational components --  know-ledge of the English language and U.S. history -- required under the  second phase, which expires in November, 1990.  </P> <P> Of special concern are an estimated 20,000 temporary residency cards -- granted  under the first phase of the program -- that have not yet been picked up.  "That's the tragedy of this whole thing -- to have spent the money and become a  temporary resident and then let that expire and become illegal again," said INS  Western Regional Commissioner Harold Ezell.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: CULVER CITY;  </P> <P> STUDENTS AID QUAKE RELIEF  </P> <P> Children at La Ballona School in Culver City have raised more than $700 for San  Francisco Bay area earthquake relief, by selling popcorn and juice and by  collecting pennies.  </P> <P> A check for $700.19 was sent to the Red Cross last week, said Jacque Kamm, a  teacher and adviser of the student council. The students, in kindergarten  through the fifth grade, brought in more than $200 in pennies. Students sold  popcorn for a quarter a bag and orange drink for a quarter a cup at school  during recess for four days.  </P> <P> Kamm estimates that more than 2,000 bags of popcorn were sold. The orange drink  was donated by McDonald's, she said.  </P> <P> Student council President Ryan Nakanishi, 10, decided that the school's 450  students should raise funds, after watching the earthquake news on television  and worrying about his aunt in Santa Cruz. "I just thought it would be neat to  send money up there. They need money so they could buy things that they need  every day, like toothbrushes and clothes," Nakanishi said.  </P> <P> In October, students of Culver City's Farragut School brought $575 to school  for earthquake victims, said school secretary Sue Newman. She said most of the  money came from the children themselves, rather than from their parents. "They  felt very close to the situation. . . . This came from their little hearts and  their little pockets," she said.  </P></p>

			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Letter: Enterprise that offers answer to improved bus services Sir, Your leader 'A better way for buses' (June 15) neatly gave a view of the rights and wrongs of bus service deregulation in its present form, but regrettably jumped to the wrong conclusion when it promoted a franchising solution for London and elsewhere. As you rightly identify, the 1985 Transport Act put an end to low fares policies in the metropolitan areas and funding constraints have all but eliminated free travel for pensioners. It is these two factors, and these alone, which have been largely responsible for the 28 per cent reported decline in patronage to which you referred. As you point out, deregulation can have its downsides, particularly when service supply outstrips demand in some competitive situations. The Bus and Coach Council, the industry's trade association, is recommending to ministers how such problems can be overcome. Franchising is not the right approach. It produces the inflexibilities of planned route networks designed and updated by remote bureaucracies and usually without the knowledge and experience of bus operators. To suggest that franchising is the answer is tantamount to throwing the baby out with the bath water. In many areas deregulation has given bus passengers more reliable services with better motivated staff working more efficiently. Bus operators actively seek new opportunities to provide what their customers want rather than what the planners say they want. The solution for London lies in encouraging this new spirit of enterprise while ensuring that the worst excesses of deregulation are eliminated. To achieve this the principal need now is for firm action by both national and local government on two fronts. First, national government needs to insist on higher financial and professional standards for bus operators. Second, national and local government need to take positive steps to improve urban traffic management so that bus services can operate reliably and efficiently. Deregulated bus services in London could demonstrate that true effectiveness if at the same time a network of Red Routes and special bus priorities were implemented.

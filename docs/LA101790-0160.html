			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S. PRODUCTION RISES SLIGHTLY IN SEPTEMBER  </P> <P> Industrial production increased 0.2% in September, driven by a 7.5% boost in  output of motor vehicles and parts, the government reported today.  </P> <P> Many analysts had expected a slight decline.  </P> <P> The Federal Reserve said if the motor vehicle category were excluded,  industrial production actually edged down last month.  </P> <P> But the Fed also said output was stronger in August and July than previously  reported. It revised a 0.2% decline first reported for August to a 0.1% gain.  At the same time, it revised an unchanged July level to a 0.2% advance.  </P> <P> The Fed also said the operating rate of the nation's factories, mines and  utilities was unchanged at 83.6%. The operating rate measures not only output  but also changes in productivity levels.  </P> <P> Production at manufacturing plants making both durable and non-durable goods  rose 0.2% in September, matching a similar gain the previous month.  </P> <P> "Apart from the sharp rise in motor vehicle assemblies, manufacturing output  dropped 0.2%," the Fed reported.  </P></p>

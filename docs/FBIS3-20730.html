			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Radovan Kovacevic: "For How Long Are the </F> Lilies Capable of Fighting?"]    [Text] In the presence of Yasushi Akashi, newly appointed  UNPROFOR chief in Bosnia, Alija Izetbegovic sent yet another  resolute message to the world: "There will be no peace until  the conditions for a fair agreement are created!" That  presupposes considerable territorial concessions on the part of  the Serbian side, as well as the accesses to Sava River and the  sea. Otherwise the tedious (and futile) series of Geneva talks  will be continued, while the melancholy of the West will deepen  even more. At the same time in the West, given some honorable  exceptions, officials are hoping that the Muslim troops, after a  successful final duel with the Croats in Mostar and central  Bosnia, may make a turning point in the struggle against the  Serbs.    In that context it seems as if it is increasingly to be  believed that there is a readiness of the "lilies" to continue  the war, which, according to some statements by the top Muslim  officials, might last for many years. "We can rely only upon  our army," Izetbegovic repeats, encouraged by the support of the  United States, whose attitude is that the war has to do with the  legitimate defense of Bosnian sovereignty, whereby the Serbs,  and later the Croats, are defined as the aggressors.  <H5>  "Divisions" and Heroes </H5>   But how great is the military force of the Army of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, the official name of the Muslim army?  Estimates about this are being made in the Serbian republic on  the basis of data collected by the intelligence service,  particularly after some statements made by the Muslim  leadership, such as Izetbegovic's latest, claiming that the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army has at its disposal 200,000 excellent  fighters. Most of the chroniclers of the Bosnian war reject  that figure as exaggerated. The refusal to comment by the  generals of the army of the Serbian republic is explained by  their caution -- "our enemy should not know how much we know  about him!"    Still, it is known that the "lilies" are organized in six  corps, one of which is completely engaged in clashes with forces  loyal to Fikret Abdic in the autonomous province of western  Bosnia.    We still remember the time when around 100 units organized  themselves in the Patriotic League, or Green Berets, while  various crisis staffs tried to organize them into army  formations. Those units glamorized themselves by giving  themselves names such as "Handzar" [the World War II Muslim unit  under Ustasha command], "Smail Aga Cengic" [an Ottoman lord of  the Bosnian origin], and so forth, while the staffs of  "divisions" and "regiments" were highly improvised. In the  course of time such a sort of combative optimism evaporated, so  that those formations finally became organized into brigades,  whose commanders were usually the local gazijas (heroes), while  only in the third phase was there a desperate search for  educated officers from the former Yugoslav People's Army. The  initial mishaps and failures of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army have  been ascribed to the "underground" activities of the Croatian  Defense Council [HVO] at the time when Tudjman and Izetbegovic  were allies, while recently also to treason on the part of  former chief of the General Staff Sefer Halilovic, who was first  suspended, and now is expecting to be brought to trial.    Basically, each corps of "lilies" has six brigades. For a  long time they were quite small and weak, some of them hardly  coming up to the force of a battalion, but now, these brigades  are up to 2,000 men each. The corps are in charge of the  defense of the territory, which has already become quite reduced  in size, where the majority of communications have been  destroyed (or disconnected), so that the possibility of maneuver  on the front is very limited, and particularly the possibility  of penetrating further into the territory.    It is believed that, after several successive mobilizations,  the Muslim army has at most 100,000 men under arms.    A considerable help to the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army is the  support of volunteers and hirelings from Afghanistan, Pakistan,  Iran, Turkey, and some other Islamic countries, whose evil  temper the Croats in central Bosnia have best experienced on  their own skin. According to some data there are around 8,000  such volunteers. There are many conflicting reports about the  combat skills of those fighters, but every witness agrees that  blood-thirstiness is their general characteristic.    For a long time the Muslim army [the Army of  Bosnia-Herzegovina] was relatively poorly armed. Its average  was strengthened by the HVO's arsenal involving more than 230  tanks and 350 guns of various calibers, most of them captured at  the beginning of the war, during the raid on Novi Travnik.  There, in the Bratstvo [Brotherhood] factory, several thousands  mortars, multiple rocket launchers, and other weapons of that  kind were stored, ready to be exported.... However, with the  collapse of the alliance, the Muslim side found itself without  any tanks. For a long time the shortage of ammunition was also  quite perceptible.    Still, the shipments from the Islamic countries that arrived  at the ports of Ploce, Metkovic, and Split in the first half of  the last year considerably improved the arsenal of the Muslim  army. Furthermore, the weapons that are still coming in under  the cloak of humanitarian aid are also vital for the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. Despite the arms embargo, in a short  time the Muslim side also obtained six transport helicopters.  The Serbian and Croatian army staffs very often complain to the  blue helmets that the AWACS planes are often turning a blind eye  to this, while instantly reacting to every take-off of Serbian  or Croatian aircraft.  <H5>  The Overestimated Favorite of the West </H5>   Finally, one must not forget about the very powerful  military-industrial complex that the SFRY built up in central  Bosnia. The Bratstvo factory in Novi Travnik fell into Muslim  hands with minor damage to the plant, so that the production of  ordnance, although rather reduced, has continued. Still, the  Muslims lack shells, which were manufactured in Vogosca (under  the Serb control), percussion caps [kapisle] produced in Gorazde  (now with the status of a UN protection zone, but without any  communications because of its encirclement by the Serb forces),  and gunpowder and explosives from Vitez, where fierce clashes  are still going on.... One would say that the Muslim army has  plenty of weapons, and even ammunition, but the infrastructure  is insufficient, while the conditions for servicing are even  worse.... On the other hand, according to witnesses, the army  of the "lilies" [reference to the flag of Bosnia-Herzegovina] is  becoming ever better organized, while its fighters are  increasingly yielding to the influence of the fanatical  supporters of holy war.    In the West the recent reports (CIA) that are coming in  express the belief, probably on the grounds of the continuous  Muslim successes in the fighting against the Croats in Bosnia  and in parts of Herzegovina, that the Muslim army is capable of  taking the strategic initiative along the entire front as early  as now. It seems, however, that Western analysts are still  overestimating the strength and combat readiness of its  favorite, pushing the entire Muslim people into a catastrophe,  as Radovan Karadzic put it recently.    It appears that more objective is the view that the Serbian  republic army should not wait for the announced Muslim spring  offensive to come into full swing. The General Staff of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army is certainly analyzing the possible  situation in which the "lilies" would have to fight on two  fronts. After the recently called mobilization, that, for the  time being, has only a preventive character, the Bosnian Serbs  might create conditions for a reactivation of potentials that  have been hitherto held in reserve, which considerably shortens  the way to a counteroffensive. Is there any alternative way out?    The inevitability of a peaceful settlement imposes itself as  an answer to that question. Another answer is perhaps to be  found in certain geopolitical theories, that suggest that by  encouraging Izetbegovic the West is actually pushing him toward  the abyss. Because Europe does not want the seed of Islamic  fundamentalism on its soil....</p>

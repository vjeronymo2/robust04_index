			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Japan warned on bilateralism SIR Leon Brittan, the vice-president of the European Commission, yesterday cautioned Japan against striking bilateral trade agreements with the US at the expense of Europe, writes Stefan Wagstyl from Tokyo. Sir Leon expressed his concern during a meeting in Tokyo with Mr Kozo Watanabe, the minister for international trade and industry. Sir Leon referred to the agreements reached between Japan and the US during President Bush's visit to Tokyo last month, which included a pledge by Japanese motor companies to increase purchases of US-made parts and to make efforts to import more US-made cars into Japan. Sir Leon said such measures to boost imports should apply to Europe as well. Japan's import promotion policies applied equally to all countries. The EC commission has reserved the right to call an adjudicatory panel of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade if it judges the US-Japan bilateral agreement to have infringed free trade rules. Sir Leon Brittan, whose brief covers financial services and competition policy, yesterday urged Japan to further liberalise its insurance market. In a speech given during a visit to Tokyo, Sir Leon said a long-standing ban on insurance brokers was a major barrier to the entry of foreign insurance companies into the Japanese market. Other obstacles included very strict controls by the authorities on the wording of documents and on premium rates on non-life insurance. Sir Leon welcomed various reforms in the Japanese financial markets, but urged further action in areas such as interest rate deregulation.</p>

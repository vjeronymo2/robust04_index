			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 25 (YONHAP) -- Foreign Minister Han  Sung-chu said on Tuesday evening Seoul will continue to exert  diplomatic efforts to get the North Korean nuclear issues  resolved peacefully.    "But, whether or not it would be necessary to carry on  efforts for its peaceful resolution will be determined in the  next two to three weeks," Han said.    The minister's remarks were taken to suggest that if the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) fails to reach a  satisfactory accord with North Korea by the time the next IAEA  Board of Governors meeting opens on Feb. 21, the nuclear  question could be referred to the U.N. Security Council for  necessary action.    While answering questions after he delivered a speech at the  Korean-America Friendship Society, Minister Han said that if  North Korea comes to possess nuclear arms, the danger of  conventional armed clash on the Korean peninsula grows much  larger.    Regarding world powers' view of Korean unification, the  foreign minister said the four powers having stakes in the  Korean peninsula seem wanting to see Korea remain divided as now.    "Though the world powers do not favor our unification, they  won't do anything outright to obstruct it if and when  unification is achieved," he added.    Minister Han also said it is natural for South Korea to  share  the expense of the U.S. forces in Korea to a certain extent.    For, the U.S. forces here perform a role South Korea needs  though their presence is due in part to the U.S.' own interests,  he said.</p>

			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / International Company News: Time Warner delays trial of interactive TV Time Warner, which operates the second-largest cable television service in the US, has delayed the start of one of America's leading trials of multimedia interactive television, from April until the fourth quarter of this year. The company announced a year ago it planned to introduce a 'full service network' - offering services ranging from home shopping to interactive games and information services - to 4,000 customers of its cable television service in Orlando, Florida. If successful there, it will roll the service out across its cable franchises. However, it now says it is postponing the launch to allow 'additional refinements of the underlying system software and the set-top terminal'. The operating software is being designed by Silicon Graphics, the California-based maker of high-performance visual computing systems, and the set-top terminal, which controls the flow of information to the home, is being made by Scientific-Atlanta. Mr Joseph Collins, chairman of Time Warner Cable, said it remained on track to have 4,000 customers on the network by year-end, 'and the development process makes us highly confident about its success'. However, the delay is likely to puncture some of the recent hype surrounding the development in the US of an information superhighway - a nationwide, interactive multimedia network. Coming on top of last week's collapse of the proposed merger between telephone group Bell Atlantic and cable company Tele-Communications Inc, it shows there remain many hurdles - technological, financial and commercial - before the US creates a successful multimedia system. Other cable television and telephone companies are involved in trials of multimedia systems, but Time Warner's venture is widely regarded as the most aggressive. It draws on the company's experiment in the Queens borough of New York City, where Time Warner has been delivering 150 channels of interactive television to cable customers. Mr Edward McCracken, chairman of Silicon Graphics, said it was important the Orlando system provided a 'fully-refined environment'.</p>

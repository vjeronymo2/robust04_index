			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LETTERS IN VIEW;  </P> <P> BIRTH OF THE BLUES OR SIMPLY A NEW BIRTH?  </P> <P> Mom-to-be Eileen Heyes ("First Person," April 25) writes that she has had it up  to here (and out to there) with co-workers volunteering comments on her  changing size and shape as her due date approaches. As the mother of a  6-month-old, I commiserate with her -- and I want to warn her: "Hon, it ain't  gonna get no better."  </P> <P> After the baby is born, you will be fair game for every mom, dad and  mommy-daddy wanna-be bombarding you with unsolicited advice on how to properly  feed, burp, change, hold, clothe, bathe and discipline your new little one.  </P> <P> All the above, Eileen, is what your co-workers, generally people who like and  respect you, will say. I haven't the heart to tell you the kinds of things  perfect strangers are likely to hiss out at you in the grocery store, but  they're in the same vein as the horrors-of-childbirth stories people delight in  telling us when we have only weeks to go.  </P> <P> HEIDI SNIVELY  </P> <P> Manhattan Beach  </P></p>

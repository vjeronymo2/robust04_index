			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, December 28 (XINHUA) -- China will continue  keeping an elite task force of nuclear scientists, the top  executive of the China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) said  here today.    CNNC General Manager Jiang Xinxiong was speaking at a  national conference on the industry, now focused on peaceful use  of atomic energy.    On the industry's development in the 1990s, Jiang said that  the country will build up a ``network of nuclear power plants  and nuclear fuel factories'' as part of an overall effort to  restructure its energy supply.    ``Nuclear industry and technology are a yardstick for  measuring the overall strength of a country and, for China, a  pillar for its international standing,'' he said.    ``There is no change to the strategic importance of China's  nuclear industry despite the numerous changes that have taken  place in international situation,'' Jiang added.    Through reforms, he said, CNNC will become a ``gigantic  enterprise group with nuclear production and research as its  main undertaking while combining nuclear and non-nuclear and  civilian and military production.''    A portion of CNNC's human and material resources will be  devoted to defense production.    Meanwhile, he said, CNNC will concentrate on developing new  types of nuclear power and heat-supply reactors and building an  experimental fast neutron accelerator, while strengthening basic  researches in isotopic separation and nuclear fusion.    CNNC also plans to build up a task force competent enough  for  designing 600,000 kw, 900,000 kw and 1.2 million kw nuclear  power plants for both domestic and overseas supply, Jiang said.    ``There will also be nuclear construction companies capable  of building such nuclear power plants,'' he said.    The work will start on the basis of China's success in  designing and building, of its own, the 300,000 kw Qinshan  Nuclear Power Plant, where operations have been normal.    The Qinshan facility has been in normal operation and is  expected to produce 1.73 billion kwh [kilowatt hours] of  electricity by the end of this year, Jiang said.    The No. 1 Generating Unit of 900,000 kw at Daya Bay Nuclear  Plant in Guangdong Province is to go into commercial production  in early February, and the No. 2 unit, of the same capacity, in  June.</p>

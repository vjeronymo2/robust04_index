Simple Model for Reformulated Gasoline Compliance <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with section 211(k) of the Clean Air Act, EPA requires that in order for a gasoline to be certified as reformulated, it must contain at least 2.0 weight percent oxygen, no more than 1.0 volume percent benzene, and no heavy metals (unless a waiver is granted); result in no increase in NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions; and achieve required toxics and VOC emission reductions. The VOC, NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and toxics emission requirements effective between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 1997 and EPA's derivation of them are set forth below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two methods by which refiners can certify their fuel as meeting the VOC, NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and toxics requirements of reformulated gasoline are contained in this rulemaking. The first, by use of a ``Simple Model,'' is described in this section. A second method, the use of the ``Complex Model'' is described in Section IV. Provisions for augmenting the Complex Model through vehicle testing are described in Section V. For reasons set forth in the April 16, 1992 SNPRM (57 FR 13417&hyph;13418) and discussed Section V, vehicle testing is not an option as a separate, stand-alone method of certification. First, models can better reflect in-use emission effects since they can be based on the results of multiple test programs. Second, individual test programs may be biased, either intentionally or unintentionally. Third, fuel compositions tend to vary due in part to factors beyond the control of fuel suppliers, potentially requiring testing of each batch if a model is not used. Finally, models make more efficient use of scarce and expensive emissions effects data than is otherwise possible. For these reasons, EPA believes that the modeling options promulgated by EPA are necessary for the reformulated gasoline program to achieve its environmental objectives and to minimize the costs of the program. Comments were received suggesting that EPA allow certification based on testing as an optional means of certification. However, for the same reasons discussed above, EPA does not believe such an option would be appropriate. EPA would have much less certainty that the results of the test program were valid. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the time of the simple model proposal, while a number of fuel parameters were thought to impact emissions, data were sufficient for only a few of these parameters (Reid vapor pressure, fuel oxygen, benzene, and aromatics) to quantify their effect with reasonable accuracy for use in an emissions model. For those additional parameters which were thought to impact emissions in a directionally clear, but as of yet unquantifiable manner (sulfur, T90, and olefins), EPA proposed that they be capped at the refiner's 1990 average level to prevent emission effects from changes in their levels from undercutting the emission reductions achieved by the parameters contained in the simple model. The effect of aromatics on VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions was also unclear, but instead of being capped, it was believed that the level of aromatics would be controlled by the role aromatics plays in the formation of air toxics emissions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Data is now available to accurately quantify not only the effects of RVP, oxygen, benzene, and aromatics on emissions, but also sulfur, T90 (or E300), olefins, and T50 (or E200). The effects of these fuel parameters are incorporated into the Complex Model described in Section IV. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Complex Model is the most accurate and complete model currently available for use in the reformulated gasoline program. Absent any other considerations, EPA would require use of the Complex Model for purposes of certification. However, based on leadtime considerations, EPA is allowing use of either the Simple or Complex Model during the first three years of the reformulated gasoline program as proposed. These lead time considerations were described in the April 1992 proposal (57 FR 13417&hyph;8). EPA is providing four years leadtime before use of the Complex Model is mandatory to allow the regulated industry adequate time to plan and design necessary refinery modifications, obtain necessary permits and capital, complete construction, and complete start-up and equipment shakedown. Furthermore, EPA has every confidence that on average the refiners certifying their fuel using the Simple Model will achieve the emission reductions that Congress intended for the reformulated gasoline program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Various comments were received criticizing the use of the Simple Model for fuel certification, stating that it had limited flexibility, discouraged innovation, penalized refiners producing cleaner than average gasoline in 1990, and should be scrapped. Many of these comments would appear to be resolved by the option available for early use of the Complex Model. Therefore, in keeping with the need to provide adequate lead time and the fact that compliance with the Simple Model will produce the mandatory VOC and toxic emission reductions, refiners will be permitted to use the simple model for certification until December 31, 1997. Until this date, fuel suppliers will have the option of using the complex model instead of the simple model to take advantage of the effects of parameters contained in the complex model but not contained in the simple model (as described in the following paragraphs). The reader is referred to the April 16, 1992 SNPRM for more discussion of these lead time provisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Sun Zhanlin (1327 0594 2651)] </F>   [Text] Almaty, 24 Apr (XINHUA) -- President Nazarbayev of  Kazakshtan pointed out that friendly relations between  Kazakhstan and China cannot be reversed. He believed Premier Li  Peng's visit to Kazakhstan would give fresh impetus to further  developing traditionally friendly relations between the two  countries.    President Nazarbayev made the above statement when receiving  a written interview by a XINHUA reporter before Premier Li  Peng's visit.    He said: Kazakh and Chinese peoples have been living as  next- door neighbors for generations, exchanging visits with  each other, and supplying each other's needs. Many common  elements have brought us together. Kazakhstan has established  ties with the PRC on the basis of equality, respect for  independence and territorial integrity, and mutual  non-interference in internal affairs. The joint statement on  the foundation of Kazakh-Chinese friendly relations signed in  Beijing last fall between leaders of the two countries was a  document of historic significance which paved the way for  long-term and steady development of bilateral ties.    On economic cooperation between the two countries,  Nazarbayev  pointed out that there are over 150 Kazakh-Chinese joint  ventures and 13 Chinese shops in Kazakhstan. He hoped the  number would continue to increase. He said emphatically: It is  absolutely possible for Kazakh-Chinese economic and trade  relations to develop faster. We can utilize Chinese investment  to process raw and semifinished materials and export finished  products to China.    On the domestic economic situation, Nazarbayev said:  Kazakhstan has abundant mineral deposits and other natural  resources and tremendous economic potential. However, the  disintegration of the Soviet Union has destroyed the economic  links between its republics and seriously affected the economic  situation and people's lives. He pointed out: Kazakhstan is  carrying out a systematic industrial structural reform to change  its position as a producer of raw and semifinished materials,  and to lay the foundation for modern high- technology  production. He said emphatically: Kazakhstan's strategy for  development is to build a market economy which will enable its  economy to meet up with world standards in the shortest time  possible.    President Nazarbayev said: Kazakhstan relies mainly on  itself to push forward economic reform. However, it will not be  able to reach its expected goal if it fails to extensively  attract foreign investment, or if it does not possess advanced  technology and techniques and modern management methods. He  said: Kazakhstan is drafting a foreign investment law to set  the stage for attracting foreign investment.</p>

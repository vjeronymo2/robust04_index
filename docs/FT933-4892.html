			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Government backs down on tendering THE DEPARTMENT of the Environment has decided not to challenge a local authority which required contractors bidding for street cleaning to indemnify the council against redundancy costs arising from the tender. South Lakeland district council in Cumbria decided to include an indemnity clause in the contract because of the continuing uncertainty about the rights of staff when public services are contracted out. Private-sector contractors said yesterday that if the practice of requiring such indemnities spread it could bring compulsory competitive tendering in local government almost to a standstill. One contractor who pulled out of the cleaning tender said yesterday that providing such indemnities was difficult as the liability was difficult to assess. Another contractor described the decision as 'spineless'. He said: 'It makes a nonsense of compulsory competitive tendering.' The council asked for the indemnity because it was unsure whether the contract would be covered by the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) 1981 regulations. If the Tupe regulations apply, they protect the jobs and conditions of the workforce when their jobs are transferred to another employer. Lakeland council wanted contractors to provide an indemnity clause in case the contract for street cleaning subsequently turned out to have been covered by Tupe. All four private-sector bidders withdrew from the contest and the contract was awarded to the council's own workforce. Although the Department of the Environment normally treats indemnity clauses as 'anti-competitive behaviour', designed to increase the costs of private contractors, it has told the council that it proposes to take no further action.</p>

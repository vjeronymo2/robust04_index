			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: A night at the Mango JACK HILLBROOKE, the legendary chairman of Hillbrooke's the bookmakers, was so pleased with himself this week that he invited me to dinner at the Moody Mango in Mayfair, a private dining club that is so decadently exclusive (the waiters are from Padua: nothing else will do) and so amusingly expensive (Pounds 950 for four) that I doubt you have even heard of it. Not that that worries us - just as it failed to discombobulate our companion on Thursday: Lady Catherine de Moubray-ffrench-Moubray, a vivacious redhead, small-time racehorse owner and mutual friend. At Jack's table no expense is spared, so we were soon up to our elbows in caviar and songthrush pate, devilled squids' eyes and ingeniously stuffed voles, plates of malevolent fugu, honest abbacchio al forno (roast sucking lamb) - and rose diaboliche, velvety red roses dipped in batter and fried in olive oil: the sort they give brides to eat at midnight, in January, in some parts of Italy. Jack is the 14th richest man in Britain, comptroller of a dazzling empire that, anchored on its UK betting shops, now spans the globe: timber, gold mines, shipping, airlines, property, hotels - all of it funded by the Pounds 200m he has sucked out of British racing in the past 25 years. (Recently, there has been speculation in down-market publications as to whether the legendary Jack Hillbrooke truly exists. But what is 'existence'? Without getting drawn into airy-fairy debate of a sub-atomic nature, I can state two things: 1) Whatever the meaning of existence, Jack is as real to me as most of my other friends, including Lady Catherine; 2) He never talks to other journalists, cannot and will not abide them, calls them pygmies. I am the only reporter he sees. It is this last factor, I fear, that has spawned envy and allegations - but there we have it). 'You seem cheerful, Jack,' I said, as we helped ourselves to puffer fish. Jack had just returned from Moscow. Despite his workload he finds time to serve as special adviser to president Gorbachev. 'You'd be cheerful if you'd arrived back from where I've just arrived back from,' said silver-haired Jack. 'Britain may be recessed but the Tories are running a miracle economy compared with that lot in Russia. 'On Tuesday I was in the Kremlin. Committee room XX. All gold and scarlet with aggressively modernist pictures of the jolliest tractor plant somewhere near Yakutsk. For their latest brainwave they have asked me to establish a chain of 15,000 betting shops across the Soviet Union. 'I said: 'And what will you bet on? The latest price of vodka?' And they said: 'UK racing.' I said: 'Do you mean to say that the proletariat is going to spend half a day in the bread queue and then half a day in another queue waiting to discover whether Lady Beaverbrook has won the big race at Newmarket?' And they said: 'How good's Lady Beaverbrook? When is she running next?' They thought I was hawking tips.' Jack spread his hands, dabbed at his mouth and glanced at the corner table. Although no-one in the Moody Mango realised it, the two saturnine middleweights sitting in the corner happened to be Jack's minders - KGB joy-boys in Marks &amp; Spencer suits and with identically-numbered passports loaned to him by his good friend Gorbachev. 'Nevertheless, Jack,' said Lady Catherine de Moubray-ffrench-Moubray snakily, 'I bet you are teaching the Russians some tricks. Like how to fleece the betting population of its hard-earned cash and to hoodwink the government into letting you bookies squeeze untold millions out of horse racing while poor owners like me, who keep the sport going, year in, year out, at debilitating cost, are left to fend while our horses run for peanuts and our training bills soar and the sport goes to pot. One day quite soon, Jack, no-one will want to own racehorses and there will be nothing left to bet on and four hundred years of tradition will have disappeared in smoke.' 'Catherine,' said Jack fondly, 'the trouble with you owners is that you are far too greedy. If memory serves, you have a house in Belgravia, a place in the Cotswolds, a time-share in Guatemala, several important paintings, more money than Michael, a Bentley better than my own and a supply of young Korean chauffeurs whom you hire on six-month contracts. 'You are not, so to speak, a member of the under-class. To owners like you the poverty trap is the gap between the salmon counter and the caviar stall at Harrods.' As time was getting on, I asked Jack whether GREENGOD-VI, his fabled computer program, had any tips for today's 2,000 Guineas. As I revealed last December, it was this computer's predecessor, GREENGOD-V, that caused Margaret Thatcher's downfall by manipulating the election betting. 'Funny you should ask,' said Jack, 'but until I mentioned your name, Michael, GREENGOD-VI hadn't spoken to us for 57 hours. It is working on something secret, something amazingly momentous. But when I told it I was meeting you for dinner it came to life at once and flashed all its lights. It always reads your column. ''Tell Michael,' said GREENGOD-VI, 'to back Mystiko as though his life depended on it - at least eight VBBU's (Very Big Betting Units) each way.' Then it fell quiet again, turned off all its lights.' Shortly afterwards, Jack paid the bill and silently departed. Which left me with Lady Catherine. Clutching my wrist, she steered me towards the corner table where the lads from the KGB were finishing their coffee. 'Good evening, boys,' said Catherine, in perfectly-phrased Russian. 'Michael and I understand that you know very little about horse racing. It is a bewitching story that started in a leafy place called Newmarket a long, long time ago . . .' Their eyes grew big as saucers.</p>

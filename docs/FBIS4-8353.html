			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Correspondent's report: "The S-300 Missile Is Coming -- </F> Military Equipment in Exchange for Debts"]    [Text] According to information from the diplomatic corps  in Budapest, following the Russian prime ministers's recent  visit to Hungary and the exchange of expert views, the chances  of getting military technology from Russia in exchange for the  outstanding Russian debt to Hungary have increased considerably.  We are talking about armored personnel carriers, as the current  stock of such carriers in Hungary has become obsolete.    In addition, we can also count on the S-300 air defense  missile system. This is a system resembling the Patriot  missiles used in the Gulf War. It transpires from the study  recently published in MAGYAR HONVED [HUNGARIAN SOLDIER] that the  updated version of this S-300 missile is capable of intercepting  targets flying at a speed of 10,000 km/hour from a distance of  90-150 km. It can be used against both aircraft and missiles.  Prior to the end of the Warsaw Pact, the first and relatively  cheaper version of this system was exported to the CSSR and  Bulgaria. Defense Ministry leaders repeatedly expressed their  view that Hungary needs this missile system.</p>

			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Apartheid's rural ghettoes that hold the key to power: The grassroots battlegrounds of South African politics in Ciskei and the other homelands THE massacre of African National Congress supporters in the nominally independent black 'homeland' of Ciskei yesterday was a catastrophe waiting to happen. For while international attention has focused on the political struggle between South Africa's white rulers and the ANC, the battle for power in the country's 10 black homelands has become ever more violent. Given that 17m of the country's 28m Africans live in these largely rural territories carved out of South Africa and intended to become independent countries as part of the National Party's Grand Apartheid policy, political support there will be crucial to the ANC's success in any future election - but their conservative leaders, including Ciskei's, have made it clear they will not give up without a fight. Yesterday, the ANC took the homeland battle to Ciskei, where Brigadier Oupa Gqozo has ruled by military diktat since taking power in a coup in March 1990. Some 50,000 protesters - one of the biggest ANC marches ever - converged on the Ciskei with the stated aim of overthrowing Brig Gqozo's government. Ciskei security forces opened fire, despite the apparently disciplined behaviour of the unarmed marchers, leaving many of them dead. ANC officials defend their decision to stage such an obviously provocative march (largely with demonstrators from outside Ciskei) by pointing out that Brig Gqozo's government has prevented free political activity in Ciskei and made it impossible for the ANC to organise among its 850,000 residents. But the march was part of a larger strategy: to weaken the conservative alliance being forged by President F W de Klerk, which would include not only the ruling National party, but conservative blacks who have built up local fiefdoms in several black homelands, with the financial and political support of Pretoria. Indeed, as the Ciskei security forces opened fire, Mr de Klerk was hosting a conference of this fledgling alliance in Pretoria, called to form a united front behind the demand for a federal form of government which would allow homeland leaders to retain a measure of power in the new South Africa. Mr Pik Botha, the foreign minister, last week claimed that such an alliance could win a multiracial election in South Africa: he said he believed 5m to 6m people - whites, coloureds, Indians and moderate blacks - would support such an alliance, out of an estimated turnout of perhaps 14m voters (70 per cent of the voting population of 20m). While his claims are almost certainly exaggerated, even the ANC acknowledges that the National party, now open to all races, and its allies could garner significant support in a multiracial election. They chose to attack this unofficial alliance at what they see as its weakest link: Ciskei, led by an unelected dictator whose popular support appears weak. ANC officials say their next target will be Mr Lucas Mangope, president of Bophuthatswana in the Transvaal, one of the few homelands with at least a potentially viable economy. He is likely to prove a much more difficult opponent. And the ANC's most powerful opponent of all - Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi of KwaZulu, head of the Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party, whose Natal stronghold includes the KwaZulu homeland - has proved amply over the past two years of bloodshed that he will not readily give up power. But while the grassroots battle continues for political support in the homelands, the constitutional future of the homelands must in the end be settled by negotiation at the national level. Indeed, it is likely to prove one of the most difficult issues when multi-party talks eventually resume. The ANC, for its part, would like to abolish the homelands altogether. It last week published constitutional proposals calling for the 10 homelands to be subsumed within South Africa during the transition to a new constitution, depriving homeland leaders of their political base at one fell swoop. The National party proposes a large measure of devolution to regional governments, which would be multiracial, but which would inevitably be based partly on the old homelands and would preserve a measure of power for homeland leaders through new regional administrations. The march yesterday also marked another phase of the ANC's policy of mass action, aimed at putting pressure on Pretoria, not just over the homeland issue, but over security force violence which has so far blocked progress on a new constitution. In this sense, the Ciskei security forces played straight into the ANC's hands: they demonstrated, with appalling brutality, the ANC's claim that homeland security forces (which are often commanded by white South Africans and are indirectly funded by Pretoria) must be brought under multi-party control in the transition to democracy. The ANC has made its point but at a terrible price. Mr John Hall, chairman of the National Peace Secretariat, the multi-party body set up a year ago to combat violence, voiced the sentiments of many when he said of the massacre: 'It seemed so absolutely unnecessary. If this is a taste of things to come, then God help us all.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From 22 April EESTI SENUMID, PAEVALEHT, p 1; "News </F> Bulletin" No. 77/94]    [Text] Friday, April 22 -- Representatives of  parliamentary foreign affairs commissions of eleven countries  met in Tallinn yesterday to discuss their role in the shaping of  foreign policy.    The commission chairmen meeting held a news conference  yesterday, describing the issued discussed and the results of  the meeting. Chairman of the Riigikogu [parliament] foreign  affairs commission and initiator of the meeting Vello Saatpalu  described the topics as the making of foreign policy by the  different arms of power, the technology of foreign policy and  the role of traditions and laws. Estonia has an excellent  opportunity to take over the best experience of existing  systems, he stressed.    Riigikogu Vice-chairman Tunne Kelam pointed out that  representatives of various political systems were represented,  enabling to learn about different foreign political traditions.    Saatpalu criticised some examples of Estonia's recent past  when vital decisions had been made without involving all the  relevant institutions and cited the example of Russia where the  positions of the president, the foreign minister and the defence  minister can widely differ. He hoped that such meetings will  become regular.    Foreign Minister Juri Luik and Tunne Kelam met Chairman of  the Swedish parliamentary foreign affairs commission Daniel  Tarschys, who was recently elected new Secretary General of the  Council of Europe [CE]. They discussed the future of the CE and  the Estonian-Russian relations. Tarschys stressed that Russia  will have to meet the CE requirements before joining the  organisation, including the one allowing member states to keep  their troops in other countries only with the consent of these  countries.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] According to a source at the Police Department,  on the night of 21 March there was an urgent message from the  U.S. intelligence service to U.S. officials working with Thai  police investigating a plot which involved a one-ton truck-load  of explosives found on 17 March. The message said that the  fugitive terrorists had not left the country but were still  hiding in Thailand. It has also been found that the group has  shifted their objective from the targeted embassy to  assasination attempts against high-level officials of that same  embassy. "Major targets are high- level officials of the U.S.  and Israeli Embassies, as well as those at the Pakistani and  some other embassies," the source said.    The source also revealed that U.S. and Thai intelligence  authorities found that, on the day the terrorist abandoned the  truck, he left a black James Bond briefcase on the truck. It is  believed the briefcase contained some important documents. But  the case disappeared during the time the truck was parked near  the Lumphini police station. The Police Department and the  Metropolitan Police Division have already set up a committee to  investigate how the briefcase disappeared. [passage omitted]    There will be an increase in the number of security  officials  guarding residences of ambassadors as well as embassies,  especially the Israeli and U.S. Embassies. The Thai police will  maintain around-the-clock coordination with the U.S.  intelligence service.    An officer of the Metropolitan Police in charge of security  protection for important persons told newsmen that police  officials had been assigned to guard important premises and  residences of important persons, particularly foreign embassies.  The Metropolitan Police will guard the outside areas of the  compound whereas the Special Branch Police will provide security  at the residences of ambassadors and foreign embassies.</p>

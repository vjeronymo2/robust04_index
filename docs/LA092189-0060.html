			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SHELTERED PETS;  </P> <P> IT'S A SLOW, EXACTING PROCESS WHEN CLUB TAKES ON CARE, ADOPTION OF TURTLES,  TORTOISES  </P> <P> On a busy day, things can get really slow around Jan Gordon's house.  </P> <P> She has been known to have more than 30 turtles and tortoises in her Sylmar  back yard, all of them looking to her for food, shelter and, yes, comfort.  </P> <P> "Gardeners are notorious for leaving gates open, and people find lost tortoises  walking down the street all the time," said Gordon, who for the last six years  has been adoption coordinator for the California Turtle and Tortoise Club's San  Fernando Valley chapter.  </P> <P> "The animal shelters have our phone number, the zoo has our number and any time  they get a tortoise they don't know what to do with, they turn it in to us."  </P> <P> Formed 25 years ago to provide information on the proper care of various  species of turtles and tortoises, the club has six Southern California chapters  and nearly 2,500 members. Groups meet monthly, Gordon said, and also work in  cooperation with the state Department of Fish and Game to place endangered  tortoises in people's homes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Supply and Demand  </P> <P> This tortoise "adoption" is a major focus of the club. Finding homes for the  reptiles -- some of which weigh more than 50 pounds -- isn't difficult. "The  average wait for a California desert tortoise is one year, and there's a  four-year wait for females," Gordon said. (Other types of tortoises are in  demand, Gordon said, but none is as sought-after as the California desert  tortoise.) To encourage breeding, she added, female desert tortoises are only  placed in homes where there already is a male.  </P> <P> Although the club has had the policy for some time, members say it is even more  important now because the California desert tortoise was placed on the  endangered species list by Fish and Game in July. Last week the federal Bureau  of Land Management quarantined 37,700 acres in the Mojave Desert to protect the  tortoises.  </P> <P> "They've been dying off by the thousands," said Marc Graff, a Los Angeles  psychiatrist and president of the club's Valley chapter. "Part of it has been  due to developers and off-road vehicles, but a lot of people have brought them  back from the desert and then didn't know how to care for them."  </P> <P> Some of the uprooted tortoises developed a respiratory disease -- the possible  result of smog -- and many were then taken back to the desert when their owners  no longer wanted them, Graff said. Soon, the respiratory disease spread to  other desert tortoises. "They've been dropping like flies," he added.  </P> <P> Rather than place the California desert tortoises back into their natural  habitat, club members ask that they be turned in to the club. They also stress  the importance of education.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Good Homes  </P> <P> "They're becoming like the condor and that's why captive breeding is so  important," Gordon said, adding that homes with unfenced swimming pools,  aggressive dogs or easily escapable yards would probably be ruled out as good  homes. "We have to protect these guys," she said.  </P> <P> After a California desert tortoise is placed in a new home, Gordon said, the  owner fills out a permit that is mailed to Fish and Game.  </P> <P> The California desert tortoise, which cannot be legally sold in pet stores,  isn't the only species in trouble. Many of the more exotic tortoise species  have been threatened by the worldwide destruction of rain forests. Their  numbers, too, are dwindling. "Three years ago we had all kinds of tortoises.  Now it's extremely difficult to get ahold of any of them," said Michael  Gutierrez, manager of the Pet Emporium in Burbank.  </P> <P> Some South American tortoises, which Gutierrez said were easily found five  years ago, can now cost $800 in pet stores. Greek tortoises, which sold for $65  three years ago, now cost $275, he said. A 5-inch pancake tortoise from South  America sells for $90 at Pet Emporium. "The stock market went down, but the  tortoise market has gone up," Gutierrez said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Fee  </P> <P> The club, however, does not charge for tortoise adoptions.  </P> <P> Although many club members breed turtles or tortoises, Graff said most did not  join for that reason. Most simply needed more information on how to care for  their pet and heard about the club through the turtle grapevine -- pet owners,  pet stores and club members, he said.  </P> <P> "I came out from Boston to go to law school and I brought my two tortoises with  me. When one of them got sick, though, I realized I was just flying by the seat  of my pants," said Michele MacDonald, a Silver Lake attorney who discovered the  club two months ago. "I've found out some things not to do and have gotten some  good advice from other turtle lovers."  </P> <P> Mike Connors, a UCLA biochemist whose Reseda home is the stomping ground for 40  turtles and tortoises, learned some similar lessons early on. While still a  student, Connors kept several tortoises in his Santa Monica apartment.  Uncertain of what to feed them, he put them on a typical college student's  diet.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pizza for Tortoises  </P> <P> "I used to feed them pizza," he said, smiling somewhat sheepishly. "It wasn't  the best possible diet for them."  </P> <P> So just what is it, newcomers inevitably ask, that catches a turtle's culinary  fancy? It depends on the species, comes the inevitable answer.  </P> <P> Gordon, who has box turtles and California desert tortoises, as well as several  exotic species -- including a diamond-speckled Greek tortoise and a red-nosed  variety called the red leg tortoise -- says that just like with people, tastes  among tortoises vary. As a result, she added, pleasing their palates can be  time-consuming.  </P> <P> "I go outside every morning and it can take me two hours just to feed them  all," she said. "Desert tortoises are vegetarians, and so I'll feed them peas,  carrots, corn, lettuce, hibiscus flowers and dandelions. Red legs tend to like  fruit more. Box turtles like snails and earthworms."  </P> <P> And don't forget about varying that menu. "Tortoises get bored with the same  thing day after day," she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Still Learning  </P> <P> Betty Alice Kinder, secretary of the club's Valley chapter, said she has been  around tortoises since she was a child and is still learning things. Sixty  years ago, she said, the tortoise her mother found along the California  Aqueduct became a member of the family. Kinder had the tortoise as a pet until  its death last year.  </P> <P> "It was operated on for bladder stones," she said, a touch of sadness in her  voice. "But I guess she was just old."  </P> <P> Club members point out that, with the proper care, many tortoises can outlive  their owners. Desert tortoises can live to be 100. Box turtles, which can grow  larger than a man's fist, can live to age 40 or 50. Galapagos tortoises, which  often resemble slowly moving boulders and can weigh several hundred pounds, may  live to be older than 150.  </P> <P> "I expect mine to be around a long time," Gordon said. "I put them in my will  for my kids."  </P> <P> Not all questions the group hears have to do with eating habits or illnesses,  though. Susan Lockhart of Reseda joined the club in 1985 when she was given a  tortoise and didn't know how to care for it. Now she has a different problem.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Mean One  </P> <P> "I just got this European tortoise, and he's a mean one. He bites my other  tortoises and I'm not sure what to do with him," Lockhart said at the club's  annual chapterwide meeting, held recently at Casa de Tortuga (Spanish for  "Turtle House") in Fountain Valley.  </P> <P> Without a doubt, Casa de Tortuga is a fitting place for the gathering. Owned by  retired businessman Walter Allen, the house, tucked away on a residential  street and resembling the homes next to it, is literally wall-to-wall turtles  and tortoises. Allen, who lives in another home he owns next door, converted  the residence several years ago for the benefit of the several hundred  tortoises he has adopted over the years. Among the residents are two Galapagos  tortoises named Daphne and Darwin -- Daphne is on permanent loan from the  Honolulu Zoo -- that take up a large portion of one fenced lawn.  </P> <P> Running pools in the back yard hold at least 100 water turtles, each one the  size of a dinner plate.  </P> <P> "Do you remember the tiny, flat water turtles you got as a kid that always died  within a week?" Connors asked as he looked into the pool. "Well, these are the  same kind. It's just that very few people knew how to care for them properly."  But Connors added of Allen: "He has it down to a fine art."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Devoted Fans  </P> <P> What is it about turtles and tortoises that arouses such devotion and interest?  </P> <P> Some members say it is because tortoises are clean and don't shed like cats or  dogs. Others are intrigued by a species that socialized with the dinosaurs.  Gordon cites the affectionate nature of one 80-year-old tortoise that likes to  fall asleep on her foot. Graff likes the way his tortoise scratches at the back  door when she wants to come in the house.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't say they are particularly intelligent," Graff said. "But they hold  your interest."  </P> <P> And then there is the group itself. Members say the meetings give them a chance  to meet interesting people with varied backgrounds, with only one thing that  bonds them all.  </P> <P> "There's a lot of warmth and a lot of friendly people," Gordon said.  </P> <P> The kind of atmosphere, it would seem, that could bring even the shyest types  out of their shells.  </P></p>

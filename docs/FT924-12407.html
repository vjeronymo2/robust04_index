			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / International Company News: UK shake-up behind sharp improvement at Stena Line STENA LINE, the Swedish shipping and ferry group, lifted profits to SKr255m (Dollars 45m) in the first eight months, a sharp improvement on just SKr28m a year earlier. The group said it benefited from the extensive rationalisation of its UK operation, Sealink Stena Line, which returned to profit. The group also benefited from higher passenger numbers and freight volumes. However, recent exchange rate turbulence has forced it to scale down an earlier prediction that full-year profits would reach SKr250m. It now expects a 1992 profit of SKr210m, a turnround of more than SKr500m from last year's SKr302m loss. Stena Line said passenger numbers climbed by 2 per cent to 10.1m in the latest eight months, with freight volume 8 per cent higher at 518,000 units. Passenger numbers on Sealink Stena Line's Dover-Calais route climbed 25 per cent, while freight volume on Dover-Dunkirk increased 79 per cent. Despite this, turnover fell 2 per cent to SKr5.38bn.</p>

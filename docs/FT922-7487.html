			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Management: How to figure out the end of recession - Some alternative statistical sources The 64,000 dollar question for most British companies is whether the country is finally emerging from recession. The problem is how to go about finding an answer. The evidence is ambiguous and most published economic indicators are weeks, if not months, out of date. If you want to be a step ahead, you should consider alternative sources of information, some of which can be obtained on a weekly basis. Here are the indicators to watch. Official data The government's Central Statistical Office provides monthly data about such things as retail sales, exports and imports and consumer credit. The information is normally reliable and reasonably accurate, but refers to economic events up to two months in the past. Unofficial data The weekly data from unofficial sources are less comprehensive and may not correct for seasonal distortions. But provided you treat the figures with caution, they should give you useful clues. Treasury officials lean heavily on such data: every Friday, Norman Lamont, the chancellor, is given a report detailing what has happened in the economy over the past fortnight. Retail sales A group of 30 of Britain's largest stores - accounting for roughly half the total turnover of the retail sector - collaborate on a computerised project which adds up their revenues every week. Every Tuesday, the companies know the sales totals for the group as a whole in the previous week (the revenues for specific companies are not identified). The data in recent weeks show that there has been little economic uplift since the April 9 general election. Over the next few weeks they should provide clues to trends in consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the Pounds 600bn a year UK economy and will be a vital factor behind any recovery. The weekly data are not publicly released, but if you know someone in one of the stores involved, there is a good chance you can get the information. Clothing and footwear Six companies - House of Fraser, Marks and Spencer, Storehouse, Burton, Sears and John Lewis - organise a variant on the above for their particular sector. Though only a small part of retailing (a tenth of sales in the sector), weekly data represent a useful snapshot. The statistics are produced by Price Waterhouse, the accountants, and go routinely to the Treasury. Among the specific companies, John Lewis publishes its weekly sales figures on a weekly basis - a useful public service. M and S does not publish its figures but sends an index of its sales every month to the Treasury. Bank and building society lending A group of 90 large banks gives information every week to the Bank of England about its lending patterns. The collated data related to the previous week are normally available every Wednesday. Much the same happens for building society lending, with the figures being collected by the Building Societies Commission, the industry watchdog. As with retail sales, only the monthly figures are available to the public - well out of date. If you want to find out about the weekly data, take out for lunch a top banker or building society chief and state your case. The Treasury gets the statistics every week. Housing sales The big building societies, which have their own chains of estate agents, conduct their own weekly surveys to assess the strength of housing turnover. At least one of these groups provides the Treasury with the information. Assessing the nationwide pattern on a weekly basis is extremely difficult. But the data from the individual businesses will almost certainly be a help. Air transport British Airways and BAA produce their own monthly data on UK passenger traffic and aircraft movements. However, they normally keep much of the most interesting information - such as the numbers of people using specific routes - to themselves. If you have a good internal contact, you may be able to get the data on a weekly basis. Car sales The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders has an arrangement with the government's Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency under which it gets data - transfered via electronic links - about new car registrations, virtually as they are happening. This can provide timely clues as to overall economic activity. The SMMT publishes figures for each month, normally on the fourth working day of the following month. The statistics for April showed a sharp year-on-year increase. Why not ask the DVLA for the data on a more timely basis? Recruitment MSL, a specialist recruitment consultancy, monitors job advertisements in newspapers to gauge demand for top managers in industry and public services. This is considered a reliable guide to future patterns of economic activity. An index compiled by MSL - which has a good track record - is normally published once a quarter. MSL may be able to inform you about changes more regularly. Trade Official data about imports and exports are published by the CSO, weeks out of date. A useful guide to trends - though not conclusive - may be the figures available every week from P&amp;O, the shipping company, on its cargoes to and from the UK and continental Europe. Industry Time was when sulphuric acid and steel were the main industrial bellwethers. More important now are semiconductors and plastics packaging. The Electronic Component Industry Federation publishes monthly figures on semiconductor production and consumption. (The most recent data show little sign of any economic lift.) And talk to British Polyethylene Industries, Europe's biggest producer of plastic sheet. In recent months, sales have been 'flat on a quarterly basis, but not as bad as a year ago.'</p>

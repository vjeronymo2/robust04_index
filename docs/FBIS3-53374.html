In an interview with AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT after he announced  his  decision to break away from the government, he added that  "Sudanese citizens' conditions have deteriorated badly, and the  collapse now includes all aspects of life, economic, social,  political, and security."    Aldo Ajo accused the National Islamic Front, led by Dr.  Hasan  al-Turabi, of destroying state institutions. He said: At least  40,000 people have been dismissed from civil service, the Army,  and the other security forces. He said that many capable and  experienced people have been dismissed and replaced by cadres  from the Front. [passage omitted]    He went on: "With regard to security, no citizen feels  secure at present. With regard to the judiciary, there is no  longer justice in the usual sense, because most of the senior  judges have been dismissed and replaced by judges from the Front  throughout the country -- which has made the judiciary in the  country a partisan body designed to protect the Front's elements  and interests. The same applies to the police, whose elements  have been exposed to dismissal and displacement. In a nutshell,  there is no justice in the usual sense in Sudan." On the  situation in southern Sudan Aldo accused the government of  escalating the war. He said that "the government has moved the  war to new dimensions, raising the jihad slogan for the first  time and using Islam in an entirely unlawful manner to mobilize  people and prompt them to fight their fellow citizens."    He added that "some people and imams say in mosques that  what  is happening in the south is not a jihad in the Islamic sense,  but the government silences or arrests them."    He said that the government thinks that "forcible  Islamization is the only means to unify Sudan." He said that  these practices have angered many southerners and led to the  total collapse of trust between north and south. [passage  omitted]    Attacking the government's foreign policy, he said: There is  no clear well-planned policy, and the statements issued by the  foreign minister appears to be completely different from what is  issued and exercised by other elements. He added: "We feel  that Minister Abu-Salih makes statements aimed at repairing  foreign relations, while other organizations like the popular  world friendship organization and the Popular Arab and Islamic  Conference, led by Dr. Hasan al-Turabi, continue their own  policies. In fact the state follows the decisions and plans of  these organizations."    He went on: The policy of these organizations is hostile  toward all the Arab regimes in the region and toward the world  as a whole, because the regime wants to export the model of its  revolution. He said that Sudan has begun to receive extremist  elements from outside and has begun to know terrorism for the  first time in its history. And that "planning and training for  the foreign extremist elements are provided in Khartoum, namely  in places like mosques and private farms." [passage omitted]    On his position on the proposal of self-determination for  southern Sudan, Aldo said that "the Sudanese have forgotten the  separation proposals in the south since 1972. Separation was  not even raised after the war broke out again in 1983. But the  government's policies, its escalation of the war, and its  raising of the jihad slogans have split the country and caused  the southerners to raise the self-determination question once  again."    He added that self-determination does not necessarily mean  separation. But people's right to choose remains a political  right which cannot be ignored, especially if the present regime  continues its escalation and annihilation policies against the  people in the south.

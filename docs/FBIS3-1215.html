Mr Coetsee said: "In view  of the unrest and prevailing conditions in Ciskei it has been  decided to place SADF troops on the basis of readiness at the  Ciskei.    "These troops could be deployed swiftly and on short notice  inside the Ciskei to calm the situation," Mr Coetsee said.    Defence Ministry spokesman Das Herbst stressed that the  troops would only be placed along the border and would not be  deployed inside the homeland.    The move follows requests from former Ciskei military leader  Brig Oupa Gqozo that the South African Government and the  Transitional Executive Council take over the administration of  Ciskei. Brig Gqozo formally stepped down on Tuesday.</p>

The certificate would have to name the country in which the milk was produced and the country in which the milk or milk product was processed. Also, the certificate would state that, except for certain movements under seal, the milk or milk product has never been in any country in which rinderpest or foot-and-mouth disease exists. Requiring a certificate would help ensure that milk or milk products imported into the United States do not introduce rinderpest or foot-and-mouth disease into the United States.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Consideration will be given only to comments received on or before August 22, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Please send an original and three copies of your comments to Chief, Regulatory Analysis and Development, PPD, APHIS, USDA, room 804, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782.

These are dangerous and destructive communicable diseases of ruminants and swine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations in &sect;94.1(a)(2) list countries that are declared free of rinderpest and FMD. Milk and milk products have the potential to spread rinderpest and FMD if they are produced or processed in or have transited a country where these diseases exist. Therefore, under &sect;94.16, milk and milk products are restricted entry into the United States unless they are imported from countries listed in &sect;94.1(a)(2). As trade barriers are being lifted between many countries (such as among members of the European Union), it has become increasingly difficult to ensure that milk or milk products imported from countries listed in &sect;94.1(a)(2) were produced and processed in a country free of rinderpest and FMD and were never in a country where rinderpest or FMD exists.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, some milk produced in France was recently imported into the United States from Great Britain. At that time, France was designated in the regulations as a country where rinderpest or FMD exists. If APHIS had known that the milk imported from Great Britain had been produced in France, we would not have permitted its importation into the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To help prevent similar incidents, we are proposing to amend &sect;94.16 to require that milk or milk products imported into the United States from a country listed in &sect;94.1(a)(2) as free of rinderpest and FMD must be accompanied by a certificate endorsed by a full-time, salaried veterinarian employed by the country of export. The certificate would have to state that the milk was produced and processed in a country listed in &sect;94.1(a)(2), or that the milk product was processed in a country listed in &sect;94.1(a)(2) from milk produced in a country listed in &sect;94.1(a)(2). The certificate would have to name the country in which the milk was produced and the country in which the milk or milk product was processed. Further, the certificate would state that, except for movement under seal as described in &sect;94.16(c), the milk or milk product has never been in any country in which rinderpest or FMD exists. (Section 94.16(c) allows milk or milk products imported into the United States from countries listed in &sect;94.1(a)(2) as free of rinderpest and FMD to transit a country infected with rinderpest or FMD en route to the United States, provided the milk or milk products are, among other things, transported under serially numbered official seals to ensure that the milk or milk product is not removed from its container during transit.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This certification would help ensure that milk or milk products imported into the United States do not introduce rinderpest or FMD into the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, we do not propose to require that milk or milk products imported from Canada be accompanied by the proposed certificate, even though Canada is listed in &sect;94.1(a)(2) as free of rinderpest and FMD. Canada has a common land border with only the United States, and Canada imports milk and milk products from other countries under conditions as restrictive as would be acceptable for importation into the United States. Therefore, we do not believe the certificate would be necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

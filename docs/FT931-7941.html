			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Arts: Puccini's Turandot SAFELY RETURNED from Wembley to Covent Garden, Andrei Serban's celebrated production of Puccini's Turandot began a new run of 11 performances on Saturday. By the end, every solo role will have been sung by two or three different artists; but on Saturday Turandot herself was again Dame Gwyneth Jones, steely and indomitable as ever, with Vladimir Popov in reliably lusty voice as her Prince Calaf. As rehearsed by Vernon Mound, the staging still looks terrific in Sally Jacobs' designs, though memory says that Ping, Pang and Pong's athletic exertions used to be even more strenuous. The new Pong is Ian Thompson, whose true tenor was a touch lightweight for their trios. The opera is now conducted by Mark Ermler, whose customary broad authority was evident once past Act 1 (where there was some first-night disarray). The Romanian soprano Angela Gheorghiu made a striking debut as poor Liu, affectingly pale and pretty. The voice is free, even and secure, with unexpected strength in her last aria. She has a lovely dignity; one was glad that in this production, her tortures are only symbolic.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Special dispatch" by staff reporter Li Kuo-chung (2621 </F> 0948 1813): "Lu Ping Reiterates That Laws on the Term of Hong  Kong's Three-Tier Structure Will Be Nullified in 1997"]    [Text] Beijing, 5 Jan--Lu Ping, director of the State  Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, reiterated today:  The laws on the term of the two municipal councils and the  district boards, which are a component part of the Hong Kong  political structure, must be nullified after 1997. Nobody has  the right to stipulate that the three-tier councils can transit  beyond 1997. The nullification of the relevant laws will be  announced by the National People's Congress [NPC] Standing  Committee in the future. This is a policy of the Chinese  Government.    In response to Chris Patten's remark that the Hong Kong and  Macao Affairs Office's earlier statement ran counter to the  Basic Law, Lu Ping said today: This is the policy of the  Chinese Government because, although the district boards and the  two municipal councils are not organs of power, they are a  component part of the Hong Kong political structure. Therefore,  the laws on the term of the three- tier structure, if they  should go beyond 1997, will be null and void. Neither Chris  Patten nor anybody else has the right to stipulate that the  three-tier councils may go beyond 1997. All these laws will, of  course, be null and void. This is the policy of the Chinese  Government. He added: As to when the announcement will be made  and what law and provisions will be declared null and void, of  course, this will be made by the NPC Standing Committee.    Lu also asked Patten to study the Basic Law well. "If one  does not study well, one has no right to speak. It is necessary  to study the Basic Law well and see what it says. People can  see at a glance who on earth is violating the Basic Law."    As to the draft regulations on the airport corporation which  the Hong Kong Government has just made public, Lu said: It is  fine that the draft regulations on the airport corporation have  been published. The Chinese side has made clear its hope that  the British Hong Kong authorities will publish the regulations  at an early date to let the vast numbers of residents air their  views. After soliciting views from the various quarters, the  Chinese side will consult the British Hong Kong authorities.  Therefore, the current discussion of this issue by the  Preliminary Work Committee [PWC] is a channel through which the  Chinese side solicits views. The Chinese side hopes that the PWC  will discuss this issue first and put forward its views and then  we will continue to discuss this issue with the British side.  At the end of the day, this is something which should be  discussed by the Chinese and British sides because the  Memorandum of Understanding stipulates this.    Asked whether Sino-British consultations on the airport will  promote cooperation in other fields, Lu Ping reiterated: The  Chinese side has always hoped to cooperate with the British side  but this is not a unilateral issue. It hopes the British side  will genuinely cooperate in all fields. Recently, some PWC  members said they hoped to have contact with British Hong Kong  officials. It goes without saying this is a very ordinary  affair but the British Hong Kong authorities have obviously  adopted an uncooperative attitude, not allowing any officials to  have contact with PWC members.    Lu Ping asked in reply: "What's wrong with contacts? We  should have contacts. If one is cooperative, one should not be  afraid. What is there to be afraid of?"</p>

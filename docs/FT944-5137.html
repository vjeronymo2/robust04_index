			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets - Frankfurt Thursday brings the release of third-quarter GDP data and UBS is sticking with its growth forecast of 0.6 per cent over the quarter and 1.8 per cent on the year. However, the bank points to recent statements by the economics ministry that growth was as strong as in the second quarter as indicating that there might be some upward risk. November unemployment, also published on Thursday, is expected to be flat, after the steep decline in October. UBS adds that the Bundesbank, holding its regular council meeting on Thursday, will watch real economic developments with interest, although the data is unlikely to have a significant impact on policy. 'Recent statements by council members suggest that they are quite confident that inflation will decline further, M3 growth should slow and progress will be seen in the attempt to consolidate the public budgets,' says UBS. Hence another small rate cut seems possible, although this week seems too early with a move more likely around the turn of the year. Compiled by Michael Morgan</p>

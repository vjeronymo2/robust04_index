			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Solvency rules for life insurers eased THE GOVERNMENT actuary has told life insurers he will relax regulations regarding the calculation of solvency margins in the light of recent falls in equity prices. The move will ease growing pressure on with-profits life companies to sell a portion of their equity holdings at what could be the bottom of the market and move into bonds. Mr Chris Daykin, chief government actuary, said in a letter to life insurers that they may breach an existing 'resilience' rule on asset portfolios if they discuss the matter with his office first. The rule, set in 1985, requires companies to meet regulatory ratios even if the value of their equities falls by 25 per cent. With-profits life companies, which pay bonuses to policyholders based on past, current and future investment returns, are required to have assets equal to 104 per cent of liabilities. Mr Daykin said: 'This letter was intended to provide some comfort to those who might be up against their regulatory minimums.' The letter says that those companies whose equity portfolios broadly correspond to the FT All Share Index, currently producing a dividend yield of 5.29 per cent, may be allowed to assume a more modest fall in equity prices. This would mean the insurer would need to hold slightly fewer assets as reserves. Mr Daykin said it was not intended that the 25 per cent rule should be reduced significantly. Instead, those with portfolios yielding 5.5 per cent to 6 per cent would be allowed to assume a decline of about 20 per cent to 22 per cent in equity prices when calculating how much they needed to hold in reserve. Several insurers have already said that they are committing new cashflow to bonds rather than equities. Bonds are yielding 9 per cent to 10 per cent, well above the yields on equities. Mr Daykin said in his letter that the current requirement that portfolios must withstand a rise of 3 percentage points in interest rates was reasonable in the market conditions and would not be changed.</p>

			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / International Company News: A case of bad blood at the KIO - The Kuwait Investment Office has publicly criticised its former managers about operations mounted in Spain THE war of nods and winks being waged by the new management of the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) against operations mounted by their predecessors in Spain has broken out into the open. In Madrid last week, the KIO publicly accused its former managers of failing to provide the Kuwaiti government with proper information on KIO investments in Spanish industrial companies and of breaking long-standing house investment regulations. The accusations have a political edge. Kuwait faces a general election next week which pits the ruling Al-Sabah family against its merchant class critics. The KIO's new managers are sponsored by members of the Kuwaiti elite and the government, who accuse the Al-Sabahs of being wayward custodians of Kuwait's oil fortunes. Soon after assuming power in May, the new managers stopped transfers of cash  -Dollars 1bn was expected this year - to the Spanish companies, saying it had discovered they were in a far weaker financial condition than previously believed. Last week, in a dramatic U-turn, the KIO leadership announced it would, after all, pump Dollars 1bn in cash into its troubled industrial empire in Spain and also convert Dollars 1.4bn owed by the KIO holding company in Spain, Grupo Torras, to KIO itself, into capital. The capitalisation of this debt was first recommended to the Kuwaiti authorities last year by the international accounting firm, KPMG Peat Marwick. The same report, which has been treated with suspicion by the new managers because it was prepared before they took office in May, also recommended a Spanish cash injection of Dollars 1bn. In the three months it has taken the new KIO management to arrive at the same broad conclusions as Peat Marwick, the Torras empire has been thrown into turmoil. Spain's biggest chemicals group, Ercros, of which Torras owns at least 40 per cent, is in receivership, along with a textiles affiliate. And the property developer Prima is close to collapse, with total debts of nearly Dollars 700m. Announcing the Dollars 1bn rescue - the funds will be concentrated on the papermaker Torras Papel, the foods group Ebro and the Amaya insurance company, with Prima's debt still to be negotiated - Mr Mahmoud al-Nouri, a Kuwaiti consultant advising the KIO management, openly attacked the previous managers. 'The money the KIO manages is like a pension fund and should be invested conservatively. In Spain, our investments have in some cases been speculative. We have taken management control of industrial operations, something which has not occurred in other countries. 'The government of Kuwait did not know what it had in Spain,' Mr al-Nouri declares. This is contentious. The KIO has owned the big UK property group, St Martins, since 1974, going far beyond, even then, orthodox pension fund investment. It also owns Autobar, the UK vending-machine maker, and once owned the Hays storage and transport group, also in the UK. The Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA), the KIO's supervisor, owns Georgetown Industries, a US steel group. It was only in the second quarter of this year, Mr al-Nouri explained, 'it became apparent that the health of the Torras was not just lightly indisposed. . . as the Kuwaiti government had been led to believe.' Mr Fouad Jaffar, general manager of the KIO until early 1990 and the man responsible for the Dollars 3bn invested in Spain, is a prime target of the KIO's accusations. But Mr Jaffar says: 'We were very successful in Spain. We made huge profits.' These were mostly taken offshore as stakes built up in Spanish targets. 'Kuwait was fully informed of what was being done in Spain. We sent monthly and quarterly reports to the Finance Ministry and the KIA. There were endless briefings. In no way was the Spanish venture a departure. I find the accusation strange and probably insulting to the Kuwaiti Finance Ministers who knew what we were doing. Mr al-Nouri obviously doesn't understand the regulations very well,' Mr Jaffar declares. According to a Torras spokesman, Mr al-Nouri had meant that the weight of the KIOs industrial investments in Spain was greater than elsewhere. However, the bad blood continues to thicken. The KIO's lawyers, Stephenson Harwood, are understood to be investigating the actions of the former KIO management in Spain. Also, Mr Salah al-Maousherji, who resigned from the KIO last year after leading a much publicised and bitter rebellion of 11 Kuwaiti nationals in the agency's London headquarters against the policies of the old management during the Gulf war, has returned. He has just been appointed chairman of Grupo Torras' strategy and policy management committee. It seems probable that the KIO's Spanish crisis will be comprehensively dealt with and that worried creditors, especially banks, will be paid off. But not, perhaps, until the new management has its pound of flesh. At the same time, it is quite likely that Torras' future in the longer term will depend on the result of the Kuwaiti election. If the Emir believes that he has won sufficient support to name a new finance minister, there could yet be further management changes at the KIO.</p>

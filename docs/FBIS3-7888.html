The ban on military flights was part of the  international community's efforts to find a peaceful solution to  the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Foreign Ministry  therefore once again calls on for a strict implementation of the  UN security sanctions resolutions on this matter.    At the same time the Foreign Ministry hopes that this  incident will not stand in the way of the peaceful settlement of  the armed conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

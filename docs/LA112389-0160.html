			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRACKING THE TRUTH OF THE URBAN LEGEND;  </P> <P> FOLKLORE: AN EXPERT WHO COLLECTS FOLK STORIES FINDS THAT SOME OF THE TALES HAVE  A LIFE OF THEIR OWN.  </P> <P> He's a moderately successful author slouched in a moderately comfortable chair  in an immoderately expensive downtown hotel lobby, his latest book cradled on  his chest like a small pet.  </P> <P> He's a folklorist, someone who studies stories with the moderately confusing  name of urban legends. He's been moderately entertaining as a guest on TV's  "Late Night with David Letterman" no less than five times -- the last time out  he actually corrected Letterman on the air. Still, he has been asked back.  </P> <P> You might figure this guy can tell some kind of story.  </P> <P> Figure again. See, it's all data to Jan Harold Brunvand, perhaps the nation's  foremost purveyor of urban legend lore. He admits he has gotten better at story  telling since he started to promote his first book, "The Vanishing Hitchhiker,"  in 1981. Still, he can't speak in broad, sweeping terms about the stories he  studies. When he does speak, he takes pains to be precise. He didn't hear  something from a few clergy, but two. His newspaper column does not appear in a  bunch of newspapers, but 16. He says 16 carefully, so no one can think he said  60.  </P> <P> You have to be careful with urban legends. They are so unpredictable. Why, just  a few years back, one particular urban legend was the hottest legend going.  After a rest, it's back, hotter than ever, and Brunvand is hard pressed to  explain exactly why.  </P> <P> Here's the story: A well-known figure (initially, it was baseball superstar  Reggie Jackson, but more recent incarnations have the figure being basketball  superstar Isiah Thomas or actor Eddie Murphy) enters the elevator of an  expensive hotel in, pick one, New York, Detroit or Las Vegas.  </P> <P> Reggie-Isiah-Eddie is in the company of a large dog. Already in the elevator  are three elderly ladies visiting the city. The Reggie-Isiah-Eddie character  commands his dog, Lady, to sit, and the three elderly ladies comply, believing  the command was directed at them, not the dog. In most versions of the elevator  story, the women assume the man with the dog is about to rob them.  </P> <P> Reggie-Isiah-Eddie realizes what has happened and apologizes at length to the  three ladies, who eventually recognize the person with the dog. Some versions  of the story have the Reggie-Isiah-Eddie character buying the three lunch and  or dinner.  </P> <P> "I'm surprised this elevator story is still so big," Brunvand said, taking a  break from the 100th annual convention of the American Folklore Society held  here.  </P> <P> On a recent, two-week tour across the United States promoting his new book:  "Curses, Broiled Again," (W.W. Norton; $17.98; 335 pp.), Brunvand said he heard  a recently minted version of the elevator story in virtually every city he  visited.  </P> <P> Folklorists call these stories urban legends, although legend is an adequate  enough title for them, Brunvand says. Typically, they are folk stories, meaning  they are told rather than read, moving from person to person. Usually, they  have some local or time references.  </P> <P> Urban legends are also told as if true, even if there is no evidence to suggest  that they are. Reggie Jackson, for one, has said he would never keep a dog in  New York City, but despite Jackson's protestations, the story continues to be  told.  </P> <P> And, they are usually told by a person who has some relationship to the person  or persons in the story. These people are friends of a friend (FOAF in folklore  jargon) who was involved in the tale in question.  </P> <P> Typically, these FOAFs are indirectly related to the teller. It isn't the  storyteller's mother or father, for instance, but a friend of the storyteller's  second cousin.  </P> <P> The FOAF connection helps to authenticate the stories, but at the same time,  FOAFs also serve as a foil, deflecting attempts at following a story back to  the source.  </P> <P> One of the most well-known urban legends is called "The Death Car" story. A  person reads a classified advertisement in a local newspaper and sees a very  expensive car being offered for sale at a very inexpensive price. The person  calls the telephone number in the ad and sets up an appointment to see it.  </P> <P> When the person does see the car, he realizes why the car is being offered for  such a low price: the previous owner committed suicide in the car but the body  was not discovered for some time. The car's interior has a horrible smell that  cannot be removed, thus explaining the low price.  </P> <P> Tanning beds were at the center of a formerly hot urban legend, which peaked in  1987 and 1988. The title of his latest book is a reference to the legend.  </P> <P> Details of the story vary, as those in urban legends tend to do, but the result  is usually the same: a woman who wants a quick tan schedules extra sessions at  the local tanning salon. She later discovers that her internal organs have been  literally cooked.  </P> <P> Brunvand gets most of his materials for his books or his twice-weekly newspaper  column from people who mail him stories. He added his address at the back of  his first book, "The Vanishing Hitchhiker," as an afterthought and he has been  inundated with stories ever since.  </P> <P> "I have to say most of my study has been trying to frantically keep up with the  mass of stories" he receives. "Sometimes, I'm faulted by folklorists for not  doing enough analysis or interpretation. I don't always think of these things,  I'll confess that, but I have really been overwhelmed by the amount of  material."  </P> <P> Besides the network of people who send Brunvand clippings and provide tales, he  also gets information from a daily reading of Dear Abby, Ann Landers and Mike  Royko. A colleague sends him copies of Herb Caen, columnist for The San  Francisco Chronicle.  </P> <P> He's even contemplated getting two subscriptions to every supermarket tabloid  (two, incidently, so he can clip articles from both sides of the page), but  Brunvand says that's quite a bit of trash to wade through to get to the gems.  </P> <P> Have an urban legend?

			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / International Company News: Merged hospital chain to expand THE NEW US hospital chain formed through the takeover of Hospital Corporation of America by Columbia Healthcare will acquire 10 to 20 hospitals per year, according to Mr Richard Scott, chairman of Columbia, Reuter reports from New York. Mr Scott told an analysts meeting that the enlarged company, to be called Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation, will also acquire at least 10 to 20 outpatient clinics per year. He estimated that the new hospital chain, which will combine the two biggest US hospital groups after the Dollars 5.8bn takeover, will spend about Dollars 400m per year on acquisitions. Mr Scott said Columbia/HCA will focus on acquisitions of individual hospitals in locations in which the two chains currently operate. 'That's where we get our biggest returns,' he said. 'I think it will mostly be individual acquisitions,' Mr Scott said, noting that Columbia is in the process of buying a hospital in Independence, Missouri and is working on acquiring two more hospitals there and a third in Chicago. He said the merged hospital chain is likely to purchase some tax-exempt hospital systems. Mr Scott also reiterated that the takeover - announced on Sunday - is expected to result in cost savings of Dollars 75m in 1994 and Dollars 130m by 1995. He said reduced costs will boost earnings of the new entity by at least Dollars 0.10 per share. There will be no dilution to earnings from the merger. Mr Scott said Columbia hoped to receive approval for the merger from the SEC by late November and to close the transaction by the end of the year. He said the two companies do not foresee any anti-trust problems. The merger is the most significant sign so far of consolidation in the US healthcare industry prompted by the Clinton reform plans and by market pressures for lower medical costs.</p>

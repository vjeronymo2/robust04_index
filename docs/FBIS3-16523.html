			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aldona Svirbutaviciute: "Investigator for </F> Special Cases -- Against the Wind?"]    [Text] Yesterday, K. Milkeraitis, investigator for  particularly important cases at the Prosecutor General's Office  Investigating Department, made a public statement in the Seimas  [parliament].    The essence of his statement state hindrances in  investigating the criminal case on the appropriation of state  property and the activities of foreign special services. The  key reason that forced investigator K. Milkeraitis to appeal to  the public was the attempt to impair the investigation and help  the culprits evade criminal responsibility.    According to the investigator, the collected material leaves  no doubt that the companies "Litcommerz GmbH" (Commercial  Director A. Klimaitis [accused of working for the KGB] ) and  "Baltica-Union" (President A. Bakaitis) were set up with the aim  of appropriating state property.    "Both economic entities were organized by the Soviet KGB,  while transforming them into commercial enterprises. Employees  of this foreign special service came to work under their cover  enjoying the status of the `active reserve'," reads K.  Milkeraitis' statement.    According to Seimas Deputy A. Endriukaitis, the fact that  the  case may disclose the interests of the ruling [Labor Democratic]  party is responsible for attempts to discontinue it.    K. Milkeraitis held a press conference because on 8 March he  had to pass this case over to the leadership of the Prosecutor  General's Office together with documentation and even material  evidence. What if the latter does not exist?    Asked by TIESA whether he had pondered over his future as a  prosecutor for special cases after this press conference, K.  Milkeraitis replied: "I have not thought about my future.  Today, I must submit the case, composed of 15 files, with all  evidence to the leadership. The investigation is still  continuing. True, it was suspended during my illness. It has  been resumed but only until a fixed date."    According to the investigator, the term "political and  criminal" would be too mild for this case.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Qasiyy Salih al-Darwish: "In Message From His </F> Prison to Zeroual, Belhadj Says: Salvation Front Willing To  Engage in Dialogue Openly, Not Behind Scenes"]    [Excerpt] Paris -- Cheikh Ali Belhadj has denied that the  Algerian [Islamic] Salvation Front [FIS] pledged to stop the  violence following the release of its leadership members Ali  Djeddi and Abdelkader Boukhamkham. He stressed that he told  Algerian President Liamine Zeroual when Zeroual was defense  minister that what is happening is not terrorism, but the  people's right to fight the usurpers of power in accordance with  the Shari'ah and the law. This came in a message Belhadj sent to  President Zeroual from prison on 7 April, which was distributed  yesterday evening by the FIS Executive Committee abroad.    In the message Belhadj replies to a recent statement by the  presidency, which says that FIS leaders pledged to stop violence  and on that basis Djeddi and Boukhamkham were released, but they  have not fulfilled their pledge.    In his statement Belhadj criticized the presidency's  statement, describing it as "a lie and a slander." He said:  "That false statement weakens the president's chances of  solving the political problem, thus complicating, rather than  solving it. What makes things even worse is that there have  been several observations since his appointment as president  which deserve to be announced. They include the duality in the  rhetoric and the positions, and the hesitation, as though the  real field solution is the security solution."    Belhadj attributes the duality in the regime's rhetoric to  three points:    1. The predominance and influence of the clique of evil.    2. Fear of the influence of the ideological minorities.    3. Enjoyment of power, on the basis that the president's  seat changes the mentality of those who sit there.    Belhadj urged President Zeroual to allow the FIS to reply to  the presidency's statement through television and radio. He  added: "We said that we are willing to discuss the problem  afflicting Algeria not behind the scenes, but openly on  television."    The message reflects the impasse the political dialogue has  reached in Algeria. The delay in distributing the message  reflects the strict control imposed on imprisoned FIS leaders  and the difficulty of contacting them. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Election 92: Pledge on value of pound rejected BUSINESS executives appear unconvinced that Labour's oft-stated determination to maintain the value of sterling would be sustainable once it secured power. Three quarters predict that a victory for Mr Neil Kinnock would lead to a rise in interest rates as sterling's value fell against the D-Mark - a fall predicted by the same number. In spite of Mr Kinnock's pledge that he would hold sterling's present parity within the exchange rate mechanism, 71 per cent forecast that a devaluation would be 'very likely' or 'fairly likely'. Only 25 per cent believe that the foreign exchange markets would allow Mr Kinnock to keep his pledge. By contrast, only 8 per cent predict that Mr John Major would devalue, with 89 per cent expecting a Conservative government to stick with the present ERM parity. The view that Mr Major's return to Downing Street would be good for sterling  -46 per cent believe its value would increase and the same number that it would stay about the same - translates into a similarly optimistic assessment of prospects for borrowing costs. Some 57 per cent believe that a newly elected Tory government could cut interest rates, with 35 per cent anticipating they would stay the same and only 7 per per cent forecasting an increase. The stark division between the two parties narrows when businesses are asked how the election might affect their companies' investment intentions, but the Conservatives still retain a strong advantage. With Mr Major re-elected, 31 per cent would anticipate investing more in Britain against the 63 per cent expecting investment to stay the same. Some 65 per cent say their plans would be unaffected by a Labour victory, but only 4 per cent would increase investment spending. For 26 per cent, Mr Kinnock's entry into Downing Street would be a signal to cut investment.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On 25 June, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA]  issued a "report on evaluation of economic cooperation,"  concerning effects achieved in those countries receiving  Official Development Assistance (ODA) funds. The report states  "projects as a whole have achieved desirable results." However,  it also points out the need for conducting a preliminary study  of problems connected with individual projects.    The survey was conducted in fiscal 1992 for a total of 159  projects carried out in 46 countries. In addition to Japanese  diplomatic missions in foreign countries and the Japan  International Cooperation Agency, civilian experts and  organizations were invited to take part in the survey. Among  future tasks listed in the report are: how to grasp accurately  the needs of recipient countries; how to settle the issue  concerning management shortages, training, and other funds,  after the completion of projects; and how to help them improve  the management system.    The report cites various problems connected with individual  projects. For example, a considerable number of facilities  built in suburban Islamabad, Pakistan for rural area development  have been left unutilized, and the X-ray film developing  equipment provided for promoting the anti-tuberculosis campaign  in Yemen has not been used for over two years.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Gondusov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 28 Feb -- All forms of the Armed Forces of  Russia without exception will be subjected to internal  reorganization aimed at reducing them in the near future. This  was stated today by Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of  General Staff of the Armed Forces of Russia, replying to a  question from the ITAR-TASS correspondent regarding the fate of  anti-aircraft defense, the Navy, and other structures of the  Defense Department. He did, however, point out specifically  that the Ministry of Defense is not yet "ready to bring all the  arms of the forces into a single integrated structure." Any  reshaping will, in the opinion of the military leader,  invariably bring in its wake disruption of the administration  system, which must not be permitted.</p>

			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SUPERVISORS ORDER STUDY OF 'SRO' HOTELS;  </P> <P> HOUSING: THE ORANGE COUNTY REVIEW OF THE LOW-COST HOSTELRIES PIONEERED IN SAN  DIEGO IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED WITHIN 60 DAYS.  </P> <P> With Orange County struggling to find affordable housing for its growing  population of low-income working people and welfare recipients, county  supervisors Tuesday ordered a study of an innovative housing program initiated  in San Diego and emulated across the nation.  </P> <P> In particular, the Orange County study will focus on construction of  single-room-occupancy hotels, which are clustered residential living areas that  resemble college dormitories, often featuring shared bathroom and cooking  areas. The 60-day review will be conducted by the Environmental Management  Agency, which is expected to return with specific recommendations for zoning  and building code changes that would allow for development of the hotels in the  county.  </P> <P> SROs, as the residential hotels are known, have been successfully tested in San  Diego, and Orange County Supervisor Roger R. Stanton, a leading advocate of SRO  construction, said Tuesday that the facilities "would truly be something that  would be effective in terms of helping the homeless people of this county."  </P> <P> Santa Ana Mayor Daniel H. Young, who co-chaired an SRO task force with Stanton,  agreed, calling the prospects of residential hotel construction in Orange  County "excellent" and predicting that some of the facilities could be built as  early as next year.  </P> <P> Since San Diego launched an SRO program in 1987, the idea has spread to cities  across the country, but it has been slow to catch on in Orange County, where  the area's wealth often has obscured a dire shortage of low-income housing. If  the supervisors approve the needed building and zoning changes, officials  predict that SRO development will quickly take off because the area's acute  housing shortage has created a demand for the facilities.  </P> <P> Mike Lennon, community affairs director for the Orange County Building Industry  Assn., said local developers already have expressed interest in building SROs.  The BIA is planning to hold a workshop at the end of October to brief  prospective developers on building the residential hotels.  </P> <P> It won't be a moment too soon, say county officials and housing advocates.  </P> <P> "We're seeing more and more working poor people in this county," said Larry  Leaman, director of the county's Social Services Agency. "We have more and more  people coming forward needing food stamps and needing welfare and needing  housing."  </P> <P> The county's review will be aided by a new guide to SRO development prepared by  area cities, building industry officials and county staff members. That  document, entitled "Orange County SRO Housing Development Guide," was presented  to the board Tuesday and was quickly hailed by housing advocates.  </P> <P> "They're calling this the SRO cookbook," said Judy Lenthall, president of  HomeAid, a nonprofit housing corporation backed by the Building Industry Assn.  of Southern California. "But I've been calling it the SRO New Testament. It's  fabulous."  </P> <P> Lenthall, who drafted the much-admired San Diego program, called the Orange  County guide the "latest and greatest in SRO planning and development in the  nation" and predicted that it would be widely used by city and county  governments trying to pave the way for SRO construction in their areas.  </P> <P> Orange County cities assisted in drafting the report, and their cooperation  would be needed to make widespread development of the residential hotels  possible. Most of the county's densely populated areas are incorporated, so  merely amending the county zoning laws would not have any direct effect on the  laws of cities.  </P> <P> The cities' support seems solid, however, as 16 of them were represented on the  task force that produced the guide, and the local League of California Cities  chapter heartily endorsed it.  </P> <P> Indeed, SRO construction has found support from a broad range of  constituencies: Conservative Republicans such as Housing and Urban Development  Secretary Jack Kemp -- who commended Stanton on Orange County's guide -- see  them as a way for the private sector to address a social need. And liberal  Democrats hail them as a way to alleviate homelessness.  </P> <P> "This program has no politics," Lenthall said. "Orange County is ripe, and  they've finally matured enough to recognize the importance of affordable  housing. I'm very optimistic."  </P></p>

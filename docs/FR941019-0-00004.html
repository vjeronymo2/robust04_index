			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One comment in support of the proposal encouraged FGIS to use statistically valid quality control methods in offering pesticide testing. The commentor also requested that the testing not be mandatory. In addition, the commentor asked about the memorandum of understanding between FGIS and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In response to the comment, the testing service will be performed on a request basis; it will not be required for either domestic or export wheat shipments. Grain samples  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that have been officially sampled and determined to contain violative levels of pesticide residues will be reported to the FDA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another comment in support of the proposal stated that the service would help to strengthen the marketing of U.S. wheat abroad and the service would meet importers' needs for more thorough testing for pesticide residues. The commentor also pointed out that importers often request official testing rather than what is offered by private laboratories and that only FGIS would be able to provide a chain-of-custody for the tested products from sampling to analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The third comment was received after the 30-day comment period. This comment objected to FGIS testing on the grounds that the government would be competing with private laboratories. FGIS has provided official pesticide residue testing under the AMA on pesticide residue since the early 1980's. Producers, grain handlers, processors, and foreign buyers of U.S. grain expect FGIS to provide impartial assessment of grain quality as required by its legislative authority. FGIS, is turn, responds to industry requests by developing testing procedures and soliciting comments regarding the specific action before implementation. It is participants in the grain industry who ultimately determine who will conduct the analysis (FGIS or independent lab) based on documentation needed to fulfill contract requirements established by the grain market.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Final Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, FGIS is revising part 800.71(a), Schedule A, of the regulations to establish new fees for testing pesticide residues in wheat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 800  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Grain.

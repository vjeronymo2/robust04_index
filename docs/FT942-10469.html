			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Survey of Kenya (16): A garden of plenty - Horticulture is a vital source of foreign exchange 'I doubt whether most people who buy carnations realise where they come from,' says Richard Fairburn, indicating with a wave of his hand an expanse of greening stalks growing under the hot sun. Nor probably do many buying green beans and Brussels sprouts from the shelves of Marks &amp; Spencer in the UK know that the single largest business supplying fresh produce is based just a little further up the same road. Yet the area around Lake Naivasha, in central Kenya, has been turned into one of the largest areas of privately-owned floriculture and horticulture in the world - and a vital source of foreign exchange for the country. It claims to have, for example, more roses under cultivation than in the entire UK. Floriculture - a world market worth an estimated Pounds 16bn last year  - has traditionally been dominated by the Dutch. Dutch companies were among those that began growing flowers outside Europe to meet fast-expanding demand in the 1970s; and one of these, Oserian, is now among the largest Kenyan-based suppliers. Mr Fairburn is director of cut flowers for Sulmac, the other large Kenyan producer, which was bought by Brooke Bond, itself now ironically owned by a partly Dutch company, Unilever. He highlights a number of benefits of growing flowers in Kenya. Of primary importance is the climate. Year-round high temperatures mean that supplies are available outside the European growing season. Of course, it can also produce during the European summer - and Sulmac is already cultivating flowers for eight months each year. Growing in Kenya also offers low capital and labour costs, access to freight (which is full southbound and needs cargo for the return journeys northward into Europe), a relatively stable political environment and no export tariffs. On the other hand, Mr Fairburn points out that international communication can be difficult, pests and diseases haunt the tropical climate, the infrastructure is poor, imports are costly, there is no local research and development facility, and the image of Kenyan produce is variable. Perhaps the most important hindrance is freight rates. Given the need to rush flowers and vegetables to market, they must be air-freighted, which accounts for half or more of total production costs. George Roy, finance director of Homegrown, which produces and prepares both flowers and vegetables for UK supermarkets such as Marks &amp; Spencer, says that the government reduced aviation tax in response to concerns from growers, but that the airline companies have yet to respond by lowering rates. In spite of the climate, cultivation is still not easy. Flowers require water every day, and Kenya's supplies are erratic. The heat creates other problems. Homegrown has introduced pink-tinted greenhouses - to keep out the sun and reduce the risk of colours fading. The heat also means that the flowers must be scrupulously protected once picked. The cuttings have to be quickly chilled and kept in insulated containers. A number of smaller suppliers, relying on shipping to move their produce, have run into difficulties, seeing their flowers rot on the quayside in Mombasa, or have been unable to negotiate cold storage and rapid freighting. Many of the same issues apply to the production of vegetables in the region. Homegrown is developing links with a number of the UK supermarkets. However, demand is much more specialised than for flowers. 'British consumers like their vegetables pre-prepared,' says Mr Roy, contrasting the position with those elsewhere in Europe, such as the French, who prepare vegetables in their raw state. Equally, Alan Wood, managing director of Brooke Bond Kenya, warns that, while a few years ago horticulture and floriculture were proving highly profitable, growing competition is now making the field far tougher for both new and existing growers.</p>

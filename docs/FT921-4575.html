			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / International Company News: US acquisition lifts Gambro GAMBRO, the Swedish medical equipment maker, has revealed a 46 per cent rise in 1991 pre-tax profit to SKr594m (Dollars 98m). It increased its dividend by 25 per cent to SKr3.75. The company said there had been good demand for its main products, which include kidney treatment and heart surgery equipment. The improvement is also due to the acquisition of Cobe Laboratories, a US producer of dialysis machines and surgery equipment, in June 1990. Gambro's US operations, which formerly lost money, have become profitable as a result of the purchase. Gambro last month strengthened its marketing position in the US by increasing its stake in Ren Corporation, which operates dialysis clinics, from 23 to 30 per cent. Sales during the period increased 31 per cent to SKr5.6bn. Operating profit increased 39 per cent to SKr784m, but Gambro's interest costs rose 27 per cent to SKr283m as a result of the Cobe purchase.</p>

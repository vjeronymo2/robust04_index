			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Report by Cristobal Sauceda for "The Morning Paper"  newscast]    [Text] Supreme Court Chief Justice Miguel Angel Rivera  Portillo has broken his silence, in the wake of the strong  criticism of the Judicial Branch made by the U.S. State  Department in a special report that alleges the Honduran justice  is weak, politicized, and corrupt. The chief justice indicated  efforts are being made to improve implementation of the law. If  necessary, changes will be made, even if it means removing  judges who do not adhere to the letter of the law. Let us  listen to Rivera.    [Begin recording] [Rivera] We would have to analyze the  whole  document to see to what they are referring when they make those  statements.    [Sauceda] Why isn't an analysis of the real situation of  Honduran justice made in that document?    [Rivera] We are coping with the real situation of justice  with the seriousness the case warrants, regardless of what the  document says. The current government's goal is to implement  the moral revolution announced by President Carlos Roberto  Reina. As I said, regardless of what the government may say, we  are prepared to improve justice so that it is a true justice  meted out by just, honest, and competent judges.    [Sauceda] Are you saying you will fire all judges involved  in  corruption?    [Rivera] Of course. If it is confirmed they are corrupt,  they will be arraigned in criminal court.    [Sauceda] This report claims that the law does not apply to  the rich with political power but only to those without money or  influence.    [Rivera] I must clarify that this report does not say that.  It refers to the previous Supreme Court. When this report came  out, we had not yet been elected to the Court.    [Sauceda] But you intend to clean the dirty face of justice?    [Rivera] As I said before, that is our intention.    [Sauceda] Will you answer the State Department document? Is  it worth it or are they lying?    [Rivera] As I said before, this report does not refer to the  Court over which I preside over but a previous Court.    [Sauceda] But what are you doing?    [Rivera] We are trying to change and improve the whole  system. When the report said civilian justice is weak, we do not  know whether it refers to civilian justice or justice  administered by civilian authorities. In this case, there is  the criminal justice, which is the one that interests the State  Department most.    [Sauceda] Will you reply to this document?    [Rivera] I cannot give you an answer at this point. We are  going to study it first and if necessary we will reply.    [Sauceda] Why does the United States, not those responsible  for Hondruan justice, prepare this kind of report?    [Rivera] [Words indistinct] used to preparing that kind of  report and investigate.    [Sauceda] What do you think of U.S. interference in Honduran  affairs?    [Rivera] No, they cannot intervene... [pauses] That is a  report they issue to all the people.    [Sauceda] Is it possible to change the bad image [words  indistinct] Honduran people?    [Rivera] That is the intention all fellow justices have.    [Sauceda] How will this be done?    [Rivera] By choosing the most capable and honest judges who  are ready to implement the law.    [Sauceda] Do we have honest judges here?    [Rivera] Of course, yes. There must be honest people here.    [Sauceda] Will you respect the judiciary?    [Rivera] We will respect it in the measure that judges  fulfill their duties.    [Sauceda] Did all justices close their lawyer's offices?    [Rivera] I suppose so. My office has been closed since last  June.    [Sauceda] The population is expectant over the offers made  during the campaign by the politicians who are now in office.  What do you say? Is law going to be applied now?    [Rivera] Of course. That is our intention. Otherwise, we  would have not accepted this post. [end recording]</p>

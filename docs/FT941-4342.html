			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Franklin Resources dealings today Dealings in the shares of Franklin Resources, the California-based fund management group, are due to start on the London Stock Exchange today. Franklin, one of the largest five US investment groups, bought the London-listed Templeton fund management group in August 1992 for Dollars 786m. Franklin had Dollars 114.2bn (Pounds 78.2bn) of funds under management at December 31 1993, in 146 funds under the Franklin and Templeton names, as well as managed accounts. The London listing adds to existing listings on the New York and Pacific exchanges. Franklin's speciality is fixed-interest securities, which accounted for about 84 per cent of its assets at the time of the acquisition, while 80 per cent of Templeton's assets were in equities. Areas of overlap have been reduced since the takeover, to allow each side of the group to focus on its area of expertise. Mr Charles Johnson, president of Franklin, said that some areas of operation were still being integrated. Templeton is best known in the UK for its emerging markets investment trust, but the group also manages a range of unit trusts. Templeton is currently launching a new Latin American investment trust, and has appointed Mr Nicholas Brady, the former secretary to the US Treasury, as chairman of the trust. As yet there are no Franklin-branded retail investment funds in the UK, as investors here tend to buy more equity than fixed-interest funds.</p>

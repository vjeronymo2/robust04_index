			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Observer: In the dark For Britain's struggling industrialists who are inclined to feel the present government is insufficiently attuned to the urgency of their plight, here is more bad news. Howard Davies, the high-profile new director general of the Confederation of British Industry, recently received a letter in which the author overlooked the change at the top of the CBI, and addressed the missive to Davies' predecessor Sir John Banham. The similarity in the biographies of the two men (both previously from the Audit Commission) was cause for comment at the time of the appointment, and Davies has only been warming the seat since July. But shouldn't some people know better? Especially a 'middle to high level' civil servant at the Department of Trade and Industry?</p>

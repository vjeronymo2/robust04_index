			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Clinton and Gore take centre stage: Brown withholds backing at Democratic convention DESCRIBING the experience as 'amazing and humbling', Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas prepared last night to accept the presidential nomination of the Democratic party. But he had to make do without the formal endorsement of Mr Jerry Brown, former governor of California and his last surviving primary opponent. In a rambling speech to the Democratic party's convention in New York, which received a lukewarm reception, Mr Brown last night launched a tirade against the evils of power and money. He blamed the plight of the nation on everything and everybody, from utilities, investment bankers and lawyers to corporate executives and corrupt politicians. He criticised President George Bush often - at no stage did he mention Mr Clinton. Asked beforehand what would happen if Mr Brown exceeded his 20-minute speaking time, his namesake - Mr Ron Brown, the Democratic national chairman  -grinned and replied: 'We have this podium that goes up and down.' The first two days of the convention, which began on Monday, were, according to Ron Brown, 'all about defining the party'. The next two were designed 'to shift the definition' to Mr Clinton and Senator Al Gore, his running-mate. Mr Clinton kept out of sight yesterday, working on acceptance speech he will deliver tonight, and so did just about everybody else before the formal events of the evening yesterday culminated in the ballot for the nomination. Ron Brown complimented the Rev Jesse Jackson for his endorsement of the Clinton-Gore ticket on Tuesday night. The civil rights leader, he said, was 'a constructive force' who had always supported Democratic presidential candidates and would be essential for success in the November election. Mr Jackson had indeed referred to 'President Bill Clinton', declaring: 'The hopes of many depend on your quest, be comforted that you do not stand alone.' But much of his relatively subdued speech was an invocation of the liberal causes which he is known to feel have been given less than their due by Mr Clinton's determination to bring the party back towards the centre. The party platform approved on Tuesday night was very much shaped in Mr Clinton's moderate image, with all minority recommendations voted down, though without rancour. Ron Brown described it yesterday as 'common sense and pragmatic', related to the problems of working people. He drew attention to the party's commitment to fight Aids. The convention had heard two moving speeches from Aids sufferers on Tuesday, though both were delivered before prime-time live television coverage began. This coverage is much more sparse than in the past, reflecting commercial pressure on the networks and the decline in public interest in conventions. Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, the focus of so many previous conventions, spoke last night long before the cameras rolled.</p>

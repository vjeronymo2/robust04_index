During the Friday [25 February] press  conference in Gdansk Television, Lech Walesa was arguing that he  is a supporter of passing the constitution quickly. He gave  assurances that he is still "a man of balance."    "Because, really, something must be agreed on," he said when  asked about the constitution. If the constitution is "so  deformed" that it will not allow the president to be the prime  minister of the government, Lech Walesa declares that "many  people," including himself, will not agree to that. He argued  that he does not want great power, but the possibility of making  quick decisions.    According to Walesa, there is a possibility of building a  coalition with the right-wing groupings. For the time being,  Walesa is waiting "for someone to do this." He explains that he  still wants to remain apolitical. If rightist leaders do not  build such a coalition, he will organize it himself. He will  then cease to be an apolitical president. He will take to  "building a block which will allow us to do what should be  done." Such a bloc will also help "win the next term of  office," but it is a secondary task.    I am wondering whether such a romantic road that I am going  on makes any sense in Poland at all, said Walesa. Perhaps the  president should be linked to political configurations, have  money, participate in making decisions concerning the granting  of licenses, he wondered.    File-checking and decommunization must be carried out.  Walesa does not say how this should be done. This should be  discussed.    "It cannot be that the decisions made by the National  Council  of Radio and Television [KRRiT] are irrevocable. There are  loopholes in the laws; if it should be necessary, some decisions  of the council will have to be changed," stated Lech Walesa  during the 25 February press conference.    In Gdansk the president once again complained about the work  of KRRiT. He is wondering whether or not to recall its chairman  before long.    Walesa believes that if "a few facts concerning the work of  the council and the distribution of licenses" are revealed, the  report of the council will be rejected by the Sejm. He did not  rule out the possibility that the granting of licenses may be  invalidated.    Discussing personnel issues, he said that he is convinced  that if he has to build a pro-presidential bloc, "many of his  closest aides will have to leave the Presidential Office." The  president does not intend to cause a conflict by refusing to  sign the appointment of a new finance minister. "If the prime  minister approves of that person, I will sign the appointment  because I support the prime minister," stated Walesa. According  to the president, "Solidarity" and the people are right when  they participate in demonstrations on the streets, because "it  was supposed to be no longer that way." The president will  persistently recall the pre-election declarations of the present  government coalition so that "during the next elections the  people will make the right  choices."  <H6>  * * * </H6> <H5>  Is Drzycimski Leaving? </H5>   Unofficial sources maintain that we can soon expect the  recall of President Walesa's Press Spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski.  Asked about this by RZECZPOSPOLITA, Drzycimski answered that he  neither confirms nor denies this. He added that "frequently the  interested parties themselves are the last ones to hear  decisions."    --by PAD</p>

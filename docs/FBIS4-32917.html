			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 30 May (NOTIMEX) -- A group of 35  youths from the solidarity group Let's Go for Cuba have staged a  protest in front of the U.S. Embassy because of U.S. Senator  Robert Torricelli's prescence in Mexico.    This Sunday, members of the organization displayed Mexican  and Cuban flags and placed a coffin with an Uncle Sam dummy that  would be burned bearing the words "Apply Article 33 (of the  Constitution) to Torricelli."    The protesters explained that they burned the effigy to  reject the democratic lawmaker's visit. Torricelli is  well-known for his opposition to the signing of NAFTA as well as  for promoting a tighter U.S. border and the Cuba Democracy Act  establishing the commercial blockade against the island.    While the police guard remained alert, Jose Carrillo, main  speaker at the "peaceful and symbolic demonstration," outlined  the main points of the protest: "To declare Robert Torricelli  persona non grata," an end of the 33-year-old U.S. blockade  against Cuba, and the preferential sale of Mexican crude oil to  the island.    Carrillo noted the historical solidarity between Mexico and  Cuba and said that "to struggle for Cuba is to struggle for  Mexico, dignity, independence, and sovereignty." He indicated  that his group sent a letter to the Chamber of Deputies with  13,000 signatures requesting the shipment "under special  conditions" of crude oil to Cuba, as well as stating Mexican  support to end the U.S. blockade against that country.    At the end of the protest, Carrillo asserted that in a  month,  the solidarity group Let's Go for Cuba will send a third boat  with hydrocarbons, medicine, and other kinds of aid to Cuba.</p>

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Defiant Uruguay leader holds out for free market: Setbacks have not deflected President Lacalle's vision President Luis Alberto Lacalle, now well into his last year in office, has had his share of setbacks. As the head of Uruguay's minority conservative government since he took office in March 1990, he has been deserted by allies, weathered numerous defeats in Congress, and suffered eight general strikes and a humiliating referendum defeat in 1992 that dealt a severe blow to his privatisation plans. This has not stopped him from plugging away at market-oriented economic policies, in spite of their apparent unpopularity with the electorate. The government has been selling state assets not covered by the December 1992 referendum verdict, when 72 per cent of voters opposed the sale of five enterprises including the telephone company. By the year-end, it will have reprivatised the last of the four banks absorbed by the previous government, and the last meat packing plant. It is evaluating an offer to buy the state airline, Pluna, inviting bids for the government gas company in Montevideo and restructuring the ungainly state oil, cement and alcohol conglomerate. It has ended the government monopoly of the insurance business, and pushed through port reform. It has promoted a bill which will mean full legal autonomy for the central bank and is making another push - with the help of the World Bank and InterAmerican Development Bank - to reduce the size of the country's bloated and inefficient civil service. All this has won the government plaudits outside the country. The Economist Intelligence Unit decided recently to improve the country's political risk rating because of 'continued efforts at structural reform by the Lacalle administration - and its partial successes - despite a hostile congress.' Inside the country the efforts of Mr Lacalle, who is forbidden under the constitution to stand for successive terms, go largely unsung. His Partido Nacional is trailing in the opinion polls ahead of November's elections, behind both the centrist Colorado party and its candidate, former president Julio Maria Sanguinetti, and the left-wing Frente Amplio. Mr Lacalle can claim that his policies have led to economic growth of 15 per cent since he took office, rising investment rates, an increase in real incomes of one-fifth and a much-reduced budget deficit. Mr Ignacio de Posadas, the finance minister, says last year the economy grew about 2 1/2 per cent, and the government is tentatively forecasting 2 per cent for 1994 - though this could be higher if the Brazilian economy continues to improve. Inflation fell to 53 per cent last year, half the rate when the administration came to power. The rate has since fallen to 44 per cent, and the target for the year end is 30 per cent, says the minister. He says the government will show a small budget deficit this year, despite a spate of strikes from government employees for higher salaries, but it will be the lowest budget deficit in an election year for at least 70 years. Criticised as an unfeeling free-marketeer, Mr Lacalle emphasises that he has overseen important increases in social spending. He has almost doubled the health budget to Dollars 170m (Pounds 113m) since taking office and increased education spending by two-thirds to Dollars 300m. His opponents say investment rates are still too low and point to a growing trade deficit. The 1993 deficit was Dollars 679m, almost double the previous year's. Yet according to Mr de Posadas, capital flows into the country remain positive and little affected by the interest rate increases in the US. While the president can claim some victories in his campaign to modernise the state, he has lost the most important battles - the big privatisations and reform of social security. Social security is Uruguay's sacred cow: the country was among the first to introduce a welfare state and voters are keen to hold on to their privileges. The ratio of the working population to the dependent population is one of the lowest in the world - 1:4 or 1:5 - and the cost of supporting the system grows yearly. Pensions and social security account for 14-15 per cent of GDP and more than half the government budget. Because pensions are indexed to the previous year's inflation rate, when inflation goes down it implies a bigger burden on the treasury. Politicians on all sides agree, though some will say so only in private, that social security is in dire need of reform, but few will court unpopularity to push it through. On this issue, the government has now thrown in the towel. 'The only thing we've really given up on is the social security reform,' says Mr de Posadas. The government has made four attempts to get congressional approval for an overhaul of the system, but succeeded only in making minor adjustments. Mr Lacalle insists that this is an issue that will not go away. Whoever succeeds him will have to adopt the policies he has struggled to implement. 'The next government will have to tackle this issue. If the trend continues, it will become unbearable by 1996-97.'</p>

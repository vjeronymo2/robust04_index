			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alan Ben-'Ami] </F>   [Text] The Israeli Army spokesman has just issued some  very brief details about a clash between Israeli soldiers and  terrorists on the border with Lebanon in the eastern sector of  the security zone. According to the first details, three  terrorists were killed in the clash as they tried to cross the  border fence near the village of Arajah in the eastern sector.  It is approximately in the area of Kibbutz Dan in the Upper  Galilee region.    Israeli soldiers were alerted to the infiltration attempt,  arrived quickly at the scene and opened fire at the terrorists,  killing them. There are no reports of any casualties on the  Israeli side, and apparently the head of Northern Command, Major  General Yitzhaq Mordekhay, has arrived at the scene to check out  the situation, and has already praised the action of the  soldiers, and particularly their speedy arrival at the site of  the infiltration.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 19 (XINHUA) -- When defense  ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) meet  in Brussels next week, NATO's ties with Russia will be at the  top of the agenda.    A senior U.S. Administration official, briefing reporters  today on the background to the meeting, said the 16-member  organization will judge whether Russian Defense Minister Pavel  Grachev's tone is "conciliatory or confrontational" when he  makes a presentation on Moscow's military doctrine.    U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry is planning a meeting  with Grachev, the official said.    The official refuted press suggestions that NATO was  offering  a "special partnership" to Russia, but said the organization  would recognize "Russia's strategic weight and interest in  European affairs."    Russia had agreed to join NATO's "Partnership for Peace"  earlier but postponed the move following NATO's threats to bomb  the Bosnian Serbs.    The official said he was "hopeful" that Russia would still  join, although Moscow may choose to have Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev sign the agreement later when he attends a North  Atlantic Council meeting in Istanbul, Turkey, in early June.    Also attending next week's meeting will be officials from  the  18 countries that have already joined NATO's "Partnership for  Peace."    Besides the partnership, NATO officials will also be  discussing the Bosnian crisis and the nuclear issue on the  Korean peninsula, the official said.</p>

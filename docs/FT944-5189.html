			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Italian banks Credito Italiano's hostile bid for Credito Romagnolo looks set to succeed. The weekend's improved offer will be hard for Rolo shareholders to refuse. It is certainly better for investors than the defensive merger with Carisbo dreamt up by Rolo's management. The deal does not look so good for Credit's shareholders. Since its privatisation last year, the bank has come under the sway of Mediobanca, the powerful Milanese merchant bank, and embarked on an expansion strategy. In doing so, it is probably overpaying. It is also bizarre that a relatively inefficient bank such as Credit should be buying a relatively efficient one such as Rolo. How well each group of shareholders is doing is shown in the accompanying chart: Rolo's share price has outperformed Credit's by nearly 100 per cent since bid speculation surfaced in September. One can only hope that some of Rolo's efficiency now rubs off on Credit. Where Credit is right is in its belief that Italy's banking sector needs streamlining. Ideally, the country would sport a small number of truly national banks rather than about 1,000 mostly local ones. Though Credit's bid for Rolo will hasten the rationalisation, the process is still likely to be slow. Some large banks such as government-controlled Banco di Napoli are in such bad shape that nobody is showing much enthusiasm to acquire them. Meanwhile, many smaller ones are controlled by charitable foundations and local interests, which are often more influenced by political than financial logic.</p>

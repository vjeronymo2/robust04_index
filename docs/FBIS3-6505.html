Samsung Electronics Co. recorded exports of 1.35 billion  U.S.  dollars in January-February, up 50 percent from 900 million  dollars last year.    Exports of electronic equipment, including semiconductors,  surged 58 percent to 630 million dollars from 400 million  dollars.    Goldstar Co. saw exports rise 32 percent to 500 million  dollars in the two months.    Exports to Asia soared 67 percent to 150 million dollars  while new target areas -- the Middle East and Africa --  accounted for a 60-percent rise.    Daewoo Electronics Co. enjoyed a leap of 57 percent in  January-February exports to 340 million dollars. Shipments of  washing machines and refrigerators skyrocketed 103 percent and  78 percent, respectively.    Growth in exports to the Commonwealth of Independent States  and Latin America was most evident, Daewoo officials said.    Should the trend continue, Korean electronics exports may  reach 30 billion dollars, up 3.5 billion dollars from the  initial target of 26.5 billion dollars.</p>

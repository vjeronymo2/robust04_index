			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Ian Graham, Michael Harvey and Chris Moncrieff, PRESS </F> ASSOCIATION]    [Excerpts] The United States has granted Sinn Fein  president Gerry Adams a visa to attend a New York conference  this week on Northern Ireland, the White House announced tonight.    The news outraged Ulster Unionist politicians, who accused  President Clinton of an about-turn on his administration's  previous demand that Mr Adams should publicly renounce violence  and back the Anglo-Irish peace declaration before being admitted.    But a statement from the White House said: "The President  supports this difficult decision and believes it will help  advance the cause of peace in Northern Ireland."    Mr Adams will be allowed to stay only 48 hours, will be  barred from travelling more than 25 miles from New York and from  engaging in "direct or indirect fund raising" during his visit  for Tuesday's [1 February] conference, the White House said.    For the past 20 years the Sinn Fein president has been  barred  from entering America despite numerous efforts to gain a visa.  He applied at the American embassy in Dublin on January 14 for  the visa to attend the conference organised by the National  Committee on American Foreign Policy. The honorary chairman of  the committee is former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger  and all sides have been invited to attend the one-day  conference. But Unionist politicians have declined the  invitation, and tonight Ulster Unionist MP John D Taylor  condemned the U.S. decision as "despicable," saying the Clinton  administration had "given in" to pressure from the Irish lobby  in Washington.    "The White House now wishes to facilitate the apologists for  the IRA murder campaign in Ireland," the MP for Strangford  declared.    "The people of Northern Ireland say to Clinton: `You should  be ashamed of yourself -- no longer can you condemn terrorism  elsewhere in the free world.'"    Mr Adams told reporters tonight that the object of his visit  was not merely to brief Irish supporters on the status of  current peace moves but to collect the views of Irish  expatriates.    The U.S. administration admitted it consulted the British  and  Irish Governments while considering the application.    London, which has an exclusion order preventing Mr Adams  from  entering mainland Britain, argued the ban should remain.    The Irish government made no public comment but is  understood  to have urged in private that the visa be granted. The Dublin  view prevailed. [passage omitted]    Mr Maginnis, MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, said tonight  it appeared the U.S. Government had "watered down considerably"  its requirement for the Sinn Fein president to renounce violence.    "I think it is disappointing that the Americans have  capitulated on something which for them should have been a  matter of principle," he said, adding: "I think it diminishes Mr  Clinton."    Mr Maginnis also said the conference would be undermined if  it was felt more important to have the presence of "an advocate  of terrorism" rather than representatives of the greater number  of people in Northern Ireland. [passage omitted]    Mr Taylor told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "I think it's  obscene. I think the White House has lost all moral authority  and cannot condemn terrorism elsewhere in the world while they  facilitate someone like Gerry Adams."    Mr Alderdice [Alliance Party leader] told the programme:  "Clearly I am disappointed. There has been an enormous amount  of Republican and Irish nationalist pressure on Mr Clinton to  make this decision."    Mr Alderdice, who is in the U.S., added: "I'm going to put  forward the views of the majority of the people in Northern  Ireland who don't want to see the violence and regard the whole  position of Mr Adams as highly repugnant."    Peter Robinson, Democratic Unionist Party MP for Belfast  East, said: "Now the people of Northern Ireland will see that  democracy counts for nothing.    "If you are a gunman then there are people who want to hear  you. There are people who will roll out the carpet for you. But  if you are a simple democrat who abides by the ballot box then  nobody wants to hear you."    Michael Mates, the former Northern Ireland minister, told  the  programme he was surprised the U.S. had granted Mr Adams a visa  in advance of reaching agreement over the joint declaration.    "It is exactly what Adams wants. He wants to go on being  able to procrastinate in order to put pressure on both  governments to make some more concessions before the killing  stops," he said.    Joe Hendron, SDLP MP for West Belfast, told the programme Mr  Adams was having problems getting agreement to the declaration  among the republican movement.    "If getting a visa to participate in this so-called  high-powered discussion in the U.S., if this helps Mr Adams in  terms of his credibility amongst his own peers, his own  followers, then that can only be a good thing," he said.    Democratic Unionist Party leader the Rev Ian Paisley  accused the U.S. administration of "kowtowing" to the Boston  Irish Lobby and going back on previous decisions.    He said of Gerry Adams: "He might declare a very short  ceasefire which will be hailed as a tremendous breakthrough.    "This is a propaganda exercise. It is telling against the  British Government because the British Government are losing  every round of the battle."    President Clinton had no authority in Northern Ireland, Mr  Paisley told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, adding: "He should  clean up the mess in his own back yard without interfering in  Northern Ireland."</p>

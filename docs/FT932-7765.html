			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / International Company News: Navistar ends run of 10 quarterly deficits AN INCREASE in medium and heavy truck sales in the second quarter allowed Navistar International, the US truck and engine maker, to claw back to a quarterly profit after 10 consecutive quarters of losses. Navistar said net income was Dollars 8m, or 1 cent per common share, in the second quarter of this year against a net loss of Dollars 35m, or 17 cents, in the same quarter of 1992. Sales jumped 36 per cent to Dollars 1.24bn. Navistar increased its share of the North American truck market to 28.7 per cent from 26.4 per cent last year. Shipments of medium and heavy trucks and school bus chassis rose 40 per cent to 20,700 units. Diesel engine shipments rose 19 per cent. Navistar sold 71,500 trucks in the quarter, up 19 per cent. The rise in sales prompted Navistar to increase its projections for overall industry demand for trucks in 1993-94. The company expects North American demand for heavy trucks to rise 27 per cent, while medium truck and school bus chassis demand will rise 10 per cent. 'Orders for heavy trucks remain strong, while the market for medium trucks is improving as well,' said Mr James Cotting, Navistar's chairman. The profitable quarter comes just as the troubled truck maker is in the final stages of negotiating a settlement with employee unions to restructure retiree health care and life insurance programs. The settlement, which has been accepted by the unions and is awaiting court approval, involves issuance of 255m shares of new common stock. The issue will double Navistar's share base. As the result of 1980's restructurings and the sale of its International Harvester heavy equipment operations, Navistar supports three retirees for every active worker. The proposed settlement, while diluting stock, is projected to save Navistar Dollars 90m per year in costs. Navistar intends to seek shareholder approval of the settlement at a special meeting scheduled for late June.</p>

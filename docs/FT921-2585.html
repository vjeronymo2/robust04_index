			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (23): Guinness Publishing - Company snapshot Guinness Publishing - a separate but it is a wholly owned subsidiary of Guinness, part of Guinness Enterprises (which also includes Champneys and Gleneagles). The first Book of Records was published in 1955. The twin brothers Ross and Norris McWhirter, who ran a facts agency, were invisted by Guinness director Sir Hugh Beaver to put together a publication which would settle bar arguments over the fastest, highest, largest records: an idea which originated when out shooting, from a dispute over the comparitive speed of game birds. The Book of Records has set its own record as a top-selling copyright book, with sales of 23.9m worldwide in 1974, sales now stand at 68m a year worldwide. Nature of business: along with The Book of Records, now printed in 36 to 39 languages, Guinness Publishing also produces another 50 titles, including The Encyclopedia, British Hit Singles, and the soon-to-be- published Encyclopedia of Popular Music, as well as a range of novelty books. It also franchises exhibitions around the world. Turnover: in excess of pounds 10m a year, although exact figures are not disclosed: nor is profit, as Guinness Publishing is a separate trading entity but also a wholly owned subsidiary of Guinness. The Book of Records represents about half the turnover, but contributes more than half the profit, due to overseas royalties. Employees: 50 in all, with headquarters in Enfield, north of London. Key personnel include editorial director Donald McFarlen; Book of Records editor Peter Matthews; and Alex Reid, systems manager. TECHNOLOGY FILE Software product: Empress database, (see supplier profile, page 18) Computer hardware: HP 9000 acquired three years ago, running around six terminals on a daily basis, but capable of supporting more. A Novell network with 14 terminals also runs off a Miles 33 typesetting system, used to produce galleys. There are a few standalone PCs for word processing, and a newly-acquired Apple Macintosh, running Microsoft Word. Software cost: Promco's contract was worth a total of pounds 250,000. Implementation: design and installation managed by Promco over a period of two months, including data take-on.</p>

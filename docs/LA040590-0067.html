			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEGAL VIEW: HEY MOM: I'M BEING TAUGHT BY A '57 CHEVY  </P> <P> Students at Culver City High School are learning about the law in an unusual  educational project sponsored by the Constitutional Rights Foundation and the  Beverly Hills Bar Assn.  </P> <P> It is rare enough that high school students are offered classes about legal  principles, but what makes this project even more interesting is the "vehicle"  being used to teach the law: a 1957 blue Chevy.  </P> <P> Attorney Louis M. Brown, 80, first had the idea for the course nearly 30 years  ago, when his children were in high school.  </P> <P> "I said to myself, anybody can teach all of the law that a high school  youngster can possibly absorb using the automobile as the central theme."  </P> <P> Brown, who helped pioneer the preventive law movement and who is the author of  several legal books, wrote an outline for a textbook based on his idea, but he  couldn't attract any interest among publishers. So the idea sat in the back of  his mind until last year, when he found himself next to Kathryn Ballsun, the  new president of the Beverly Hills Bar Assn., at a luncheon in his honor. He  mentioned the idea to her, and as he puts it, she "went running with it."  </P> <P> The 10-week, one-day-a-week course, taught by several volunteer attorneys,  began at Culver City High School in February and will move to Santa Monica High  School this month.  </P> <P> Ballsun says her goal is for school districts across the country to pick up the  idea.  </P> <P> The curriculum uses the purchase, repair and operation of a blue '57 Chevy to  illustrate these legal concepts: basic legal rights (the right to own property,  to seek redress through the courts); contract law (the purchase of a car is a  contract); automobile insurance; consumer rights (lemon laws, repairs), and  criminal law (tickets, arrest).  </P> <P> "The students love it," Ballsun says. "The law becomes something living and  vital for them, rather than abstract principles.  </P> <P> "Our goal," she continues, "is to expose high school students in a positive way  to the concept of laws and how important they are in their daily lives."  </P> <P> The handouts given each student at the beginning of the course demonstrate the  pervasive impact the law can have on even a high school student. Included are  an automobile purchase agreement, a manufacturer's warranty, a loan and  security agreement (this allows the bank to repossess the car if you don't pay  your car payment), a traffic ticket form, and a criminal complaint (the legal  document that sets forth the crime with which a defendant is charged).  </P> <P> And, no matter what your age, you'd be doing pretty well if you could  understand all that.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Xia Zhaolong (1115 0340 7893) and Tan Jianrong </F> (6151 1696 2837)]    [Text] Tokyo, 7 Jan (XINHUA) -- Japanese deputy prime  minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata said here today that  Japan-China ties have entered a new stage. In the coming years,  it will be imperative to be world-oriented and future-oriented  and to develop the friendly and cooperative relations between  the two countries in a more extensive way.    Hata made the following comments in an interview with XINHUA  at the Diet building prior to his visit to China.    He said: "We celebrated the 20th anniversary of Japan-China  diplomatic normalization the year before last. Last year  witnessed the 15th anniversary of the conclusion of Japan-China  peace and friendship treaty. Relations between the two  countries have entered a new stage.    Hata pleasantly recalled his visit to China in January 1973.  He said with deep feeling: "I am very pleased to see that the  relations between Japan and China have been developed in such an  extensive and profound way over the past 21 years. I visit  China every two or three years and every time I am very strongly  impressed with the fine relations that are increasingly  developing."    He said: In developing Japan-China ties, it is imperative to  face the future and be conducive to world affairs in the future.  As far as Japan is concerned, we should not forget to  introspect the past's history. We should render active support  to China in its reform and economic development. He continued:  "A long-term and sustainable economic development in China is of  vital importance. Now China is striving to build a socialist  market economy. If it succeeds, it will have a significant  bearing on the global economic development and on peace and  stability in Asia and the world at large."    Commenting on Japan's economic cooperation with China and  its  aid to China, Hata said: It is hoped that China will pay  attention to environmental protection while developing its  economy. He said: "China is now upgrading weapons and striving  to modernize its equipment. I do not believe that China will go  for a big-military power status." He said that Japan will  continue to provide aid and support to China in the future.    On the question of Japan-Taiwan ties, Hata said: The  Japanese  Government has maintained non-official contacts with Taiwan  since the normalization of diplomatic ties between Japan and  China. Although there are divergent views on the issue at home,  the government's principled position is unchanged and it will  remain so in the future."    At the conclusion of his interview, Hata said: Prime  Minister  Hosokawa has expressed on many occasions his wishes to visit  China. When the opportunity arises, he will pay a visit at the  earliest possible date.</p>

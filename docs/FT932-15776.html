			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / A deceptive blossoming arouses many doubts: Robert Thomson takes the temperature of the Japanese economy amid first worries about overheating THE DELICATE petals of Tokyo's cherry blossom trees are fluttering to ground after a beautiful but brief existence, inspiring the annual batch of Japanese poetry about human frailty, and prompting comparisons to the perceived flowering of Japan's 'economic recovery'. Finance ministry officials may be in the final days of negotiation with other ministries on another emergency package to stimulate growth, but Mr Hajime Funada, director-general of the economic planning agency, warned this week that an already revived economy is in danger of 'overheating'. He may be referring to the renewed vigour at the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where the Nikkei market average again momentarily crossed the 20,000 line yesterday, or the strengthening of the yen, whose erratic movements are partly founded on the interpretation that the worst is over in Japan. Debate over the arrival - or not - of the recovery has complicated the negotiations on the stimulatory package, due on Tuesday and now estimated to total Y12,000bn (Pounds 70bn). A finance ministry official involved in the preparations said: 'we want to make sure the recovery is a firm one', though he conceded, 'we don't know whether recovery will be L-shaped or U-shaped'. However, close scrutiny of economic indicators, other than the stock market index, suggests that the spring recovery could be as fleeting as the cherry blossom, which survives on the tree for about two and half weeks. Mr Yasushi Mieno, the Bank of Japan governor, remains concerned by 'weak final demand', meaning personal consumption and corporate capital investment. Bank officials also fear that premature talk of recovery will tempt troubled companies to avoid the painful reforms needed to improve core profitability. Companies do appear to be gaining confidence. Mitsubishi Corporation, the trading house at the centre of the Mitsubishi group, said yesterday that it has begun reviewing gloomy forecasts. NEC, the electronics company, said bottom was apparently touched in November or December, and 'things are picking up'. Sifting through the indicators, companies were encouraged by a 1.5 per cent year-on-year increase in new car sales in March, after 14 consecutive months of decline. Housing starts rose 6.3 per cent in February, after an increase of 0.9 per cent in January. Another sign of revival was a slim 0.2 per cent expansion of money supply in February, after a contraction of 0.3 per cent in the previous month. But these positive figures are more than matched by indicators which suggest that a recovery may not come until next year, and bring only a modest increase in sales, not a return to the dizzy heights of the late 1980s, for which some ambitious manufacturers are still geared. The car sales figures were an improvement, but also reflected a rush of new model releases by Japanese makers. Housing starts by owner-occupiers are gathering momentum, but the rental market is very weak and the overall private construction market is frail. Orders received by the 57 largest contractors were down 36.3 per cent in February, against a year earlier. Public sector construction orders will be spurred by the government package, but the public market is about a third the size of the private construction market. Land prices are still falling, office rents were down by 30 to 40 per cent last year in some Tokyo districts, and banks, weighed down by bad loans, are unwilling to lend to developers. The 'final demand' problem, identified by Mr Mieno and discusssed this week at a meeting of the Bank of Japan's regional branch managers, is far from solved. Consumers seem not to share the stock market's confidence, as department store sales were down 6.1 per cent in February while smaller retailers reported a 5.4 drop in their sales. Consumer wariness has come with concerns about job security and salary levels. Overtime is falling, and the Japanese workforce shrank by 0.4 per cent in February, the first decline in seven years. The most obvious victims of cost-cutting are women, as the number working fell by 410,000 or 1.6 per cent over the year These patterns are not reflected in the core unemployment figure, steady at 2.3 per cent in February, after edging to 2.4 per cent in December. But there is evidence of change in the jobs-to-applicants ratio, which stood at 0.91 in February, meaning that seekers outnumbered vacancies. In September, the ratio was 1.01 - that is, slightly more jobs than applicants. Corporate Japan may sense that a recovery has begun, but cost-cutting plans remain in place and will continue to dampen demand. A survey by Long-term Credit Bank of Japan found that listed companies intend to cut capital spending by an average 4 per cent this fiscal year, following a 3.9 per cent decline in the year just ended. Instead of drawing attention to an imminent recovery, LTCB noted, 'virtually all industries are trimming their investments' and 'many industries that have been slow to adjust to economic changes will finally begin cutting their investments in earnest'. Sumitomo Metal Mining, a member of the Sumitomo group, announced yesterday that capital spending will fall 45 per cent this year. Companies are still digesting capacity added during the late 1980s, when machinery orders from manufacturers rose 18.5 per cent. Last year, orders from the same sector fell 18.6 per cent, and another 14.9 per cent fall was reported in January. The electronics sector still appears to have over-capacity of 30-40 per cent, and depreciation charges on recently added facilities are continuing to rise. The mixed statistical signals have put extra pressure on the finance ministry to design a new package that stimulates final demand, and assists small and medium-sized companies, and not just the construction industry. Ministry officials concede that smaller companies are facing a 'credit crunch' because of banks' reluctance to lend, stimulating demand for funds from government-affiliated institutions.</p>

			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Japan's ruling party defeated in by-election JAPAN'S ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) was defeated at an important by-election yesterday, heightening pressure within the party for Mr Kiichi Miyazawa to step down as prime minister to appease voters disillusioned with the scandal-tainted government. The upper house poll in Miyagi, in northern Japan, was narrowly won by a trade union candidate backed by the Social Democratic Party of Japan, which had taken the seat in 1989 when the LDP was troubled by an earlier set of corruption scandals. In conceding defeat, Mr Miyazawa said that the party had waged an 'excellent fight' in attempting to regain the seat, but the result and a low voter turnout highlighted public disaffection with the LDP. Opposition politicians said the outcome was a significant victory for them, and showed that the public wanted reforms of the scandal-prone political system. Mr Tamisuke Watanuki, the LDP secretary-general, said that 'we deeply regret' failing to win and will 'do our best to revive public trust'. Mr Miyazawa had campaigned on behalf of his party, although the local campaign manager had suggested that it would in the LDP's best interests if the prime minister stayed away. The branch had wanted to focus its campaign on local issues, drawing attention away from the scandals at the party's centre. The Miyagi area is also an important rice-growing district, and it was expected that some farmers, traditional LDP supporters, would have deserted the party or not voted as a protest against the expected liberalisation of Japan's rice market.</p>

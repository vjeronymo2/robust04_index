			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / International Company News: Intel share price plunges as fresh trial is ordered INTEL'S share price plunged yesterday in response to an announcement late on Friday that a new trial had been ordered in its copyright licensing dispute with rival semiconductor manufacturer Advanced Micro Devices. The court set aside an earlier decision preventing AMD from competing with Intel in the lucrative market for 486 high-performance microprocessors used in personal computers. Yesterday, AMD said it would enter the 486 microprocessor market immediately. Intel's stock closed down Dollars 12 1/4 at Dollars 97 3/4 yesterday in New York in very heavy trading, with 17.7m shares changing hands. In a decision announced on Friday, US district court judge William Ingram ruled that Intel had failed to produce documents that were relevant to the copyright dispute, preventing AMD from getting a fair trial in litigation decided last June. Pending the outcome of the new trial, there is no legal barrier preventing AMD from shipping microprocessors that incorporate Intel microcode, the software that controls the functions of a microprocessor, AMD said. AMD will begin shipments of a 486, using Intel's microcode, this month, but will continue development of its own microcode and introduce new versions of the 486 later. 'The worldwide computer industry has been held hostage to an unfairly maintained monopoly on 486 microprocessors,' said Mr WJ Sanders, chairman and chief executive officer of AMD.</p>

This action appears necessary to ensure that the origin health certificate contains all of the information required by the foreign country of destination. We are also proposing to amend the requirements concerning scrapie for sheep and goats intended for export. This action would clarify the regulations and make the terminology used in the export regulations consistent with that used in our domestic scrapie regulations. We are also proposing to revise one definition in the domestic scrapie regulations to make the definitions in those regulations consistent with each other.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Consideration will be given only to comments received on or before July 12, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Please send an original and three copies of your comments to Chief, Regulatory Analysis and Development, PPD, APHIS, USDA, room 804, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782.

The regulations provide, among other things, that all animals intended for exportation to a foreign country, except animals intended for exportation to Mexico or Canada and cattle from Mexico imported into the United States in bond for temporary feeding and return to Mexico, must be accompanied from the State of origin of the export movement to the port of embarkation by an origin health certificate. All animals intended for exportation to Mexico or Canada, except cattle from Mexico imported into the United States in bond for temporary feeding and return to Mexico, must be accompanied from the State of origin of the export movement to the border of the United States by an origin health certificate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations state that the origin health certificate shall certify that the animals were inspected within the 30 days prior to the date of the movement of the animals for export, and were found to be sound, healthy, and free from evidence of communicable disease and exposure to communicable disease. The origin health certificate, issued by an Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) representative or an accredited veterinarian, must be endorsed by an authorized APHIS veterinarian in the State of origin. The origin health certificate must also include any test results added by the authorized APHIS veterinarian pursuant to 9 CFR 161.3, which allows test results to be added to an origin health certificate after it is issued or signed by an accredited veterinarian. (Because of a typographical error, the reference in part 91 is to ``&sect;161.2.'' As part of this proposed rule, this reference would be corrected.) The origin health certificate must individually identify the animals in the shipment as to species, breed, sex, and age, and, if applicable, must also show registration name and number, tattoo markings, or other natural or acquired markings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the information described in the preceding paragraph, a foreign country of destination may require that its health requirements be added to the origin health certificate. Because these requirements are not imposed by the United States, and may vary from export to export depending on the requirements of the destination country, they are not set out in our regulations. However, unless all information required by a foreign government is included on the origin health certificate, that animal may be refused entry into the foreign country upon export. To help prevent the return of animals to the United States because they were refused entry in another country, we are proposing to amend &sect;91.3 to require that the origin health certificate include any test results, certifications, or other statements required by the foreign country of destination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

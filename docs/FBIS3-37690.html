			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent Georgiy Shmelev] </F>   [Text] Prague February 21 TASS -- As concerns speculations  about "Russia's sphere of interests in Eastern Europe", Russia  does not imply anything else but its desire to develop  comprehensive cooperation with the countries of this region,"  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said in winding up the  first leg of his East European tour in Prague.    He said the Visegrad group of countries was of special  interest to Russia because it has long been linked to them by  traditional political, economic, cultural and religious ties.    During his visit to Prague, the Russian minister was  received  by Czech President Vaclav Havel and held talks with Prime  Minister Vaclav Klaus and his Czech counterpart Josef Zelenc.    President Havel said the talks were "very intensive" and  touched upon European security and the roles of NATO and the  Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe in the  European security process. Naturally, the Bosnian conflict was  one of the main items on the agenda of the talks. Havel said  that the Czech Republic was backing the NATO ultimatum but  believed that preliminary consultations with Russia were  necessary.    According to Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus the two countries  expressed "very similar views" on all the problems under  discussion. This applied to bilateral relations and to  international issues, including the situation in Europe.    Speaking about the Czech Republic's attitude to NATO, Klaus  said that "Prague was striving to become a "standard" European  state and consequently a member of Europe's standard structures,  including NATO and the European Union". In this respect the  Czech Republic's membership of NATO would not mean that it seeks  "to protect itself from Russia". It is intended to ensure  national security and is not targeted against any other country.    The Russian minister told the Czech president that the aim  of  his visit to the Czech Republic, in accordance with President  Boris Yeltsin's wish, was "to try and understand how our  neighbours and our friends are feeling". He said that the  desire to continue political dialogue on wide range of problems  of European security and bilateral relations, confirmed by the  sides during his visit to Prague, was an important result of  talks in the Czech Republic. He stressed that there are  extensive possibilities for the development of traditional  cultural and religious ties between Moscow and Prague.    Responding to a question from ITAR-TASS, the Russian  minister  said he was leaving Prague with an understanding that two  schools are now acting in the Czech Republic -- one of President  Vaclav Havel and the other of Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus. The  first one teaches how to combat totalitarianism in any form and  how to struggle for democracy and human rights. The second  school teaches radical economic reforms.    The development of religious and spiritual ties between the  two countries was considered at a meeting between archbishop  Milo Vilka of Prague and Archimadrite Feofan, who arrived in the  Czech capital as a member of the Russian delegation.    The Russian foreign minister will continue his East European  tour today. He is due to fly to Budapest.</p>

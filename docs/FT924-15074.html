			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / The ERM And Maastricht: Schluter calls for more open and democratic EC DENMARK'S prime minister, Mr Poul Schluter, yesterday called for a more open and democratic European Community so that Danes could reverse their No to the Maastricht treaty, Reuter reports from Copenhagen. 'The subsidiarity principle. . . . should be established as the EC's fundamental law,' he told parliament. 'European co-operation should be characterised by the very opposite of centralism, by something completely different than 'the United States of Europe' which some people are talking about. It is quite clear that the Maastricht treaty. . . cannot take effect without a common solution which takes Denmark's No on June 2 into consideration.' The outlines of the solution should be clear in time for the EC summit in December.</p>

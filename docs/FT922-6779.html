			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading ACTIVITY in the derivatives market returned to comfortably high levels yesterday, prompted by bid talk and buying by independent traders, writes Peter John. The Footsie contract for June delivery was consistently at a premium to its estimated fair value, which currently stands around 8 points above the underlying cash index. The June contract opened higher on the back of a strong Wall Street and Tuesday's well-received company figures, and remained firm until the announcement of slightly disappointing retail sales figures. At the official close it stood at 2,734, a premium of 22.2 to cash and 14 above fair value. There were almost 9,500 contracts traded. In after-hours' dealing it moved back to 2,726 and turnover swelled to 10,800 lots. Volume was boosted by a 2,000-lot spread trade in the June and September contracts. Due to a change in the expiry rules, the near-month contract will end on June 19 as opposed to the end of the month, and rolling out into September will subsequently begin earlier than usual. Turnover in traded options was also high at 39,523 lots, compared with Tuesday's 27,710. British Airways was the most popular stock option, with 4,214 contracts traded as investors continued to respond to Tuesday's impressive figures. BP was also in demand.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Fifth article in a series by Virginijus Gaivenis: "Who </F> Armed National Defense? (5)"]    [Excerpts] Last spring, National Defense Ministry [KAM]  leaders were preoccupied with the purchase of helicopters. The  occasion was very convenient -- Lithuania was preparing for the  visit of Pope John Paul II. To this end, the commanders of the  Lithuanian Air Force applied to the leaders of the Ministry of  Transportation with the request of assessing whether a  helicopter from Palukne airport was suitable for this purpose.  On 28 April, the helicopter MI-8 MTV offered by the private  firm "Akvel" was inspected. However, the conclusion about the  helicopter's suitability for the pope's mission, submitted by A.  Raklevicius, chief of the Civilian Aviation Department Aircraft  Section, did not seem to cheer up KAM Air Force Commander Z.  Vegelevicius. The decision was categorical: "The helicopter  cannot be used during the pope's visit in Lithuania." As  representatives of the Transportation Ministry noted, the  "Akvel" commodity was not new. [passage omitted] This closed  stock company expected to earn more than $1 million on its  helicopter. Sensing that such a price was unrealistic, the  "Akvel" manager blurted out in a private conversation that he  would sell it to the National Defense Ministry for $700,000 or  $800,000. The problem was that there was no place to store this  helicopter in Lithuania, and some of its necessary documentation  was missing.    It seemed that this deal would be buried, because the KAM  leaders did not apply to experts for help any more. They kept  silent on any helicopter purchases, intentions to buy them, and  partners. The fact that the same helicopter offered by "Akvel"  had already been bought for $1,100,000 was discovered after the  deal. The price paid for another two helicopters sold by the  closed stock company "Mingrin" was also revealed then.  Lithuania had paid from its pocket even $2.4 million for two  MI-8T helicopters. The latter, which Z. Vegelevicius hopes to  use for rescue operations, in motorized landing subunits,  consignment, and reconnaissance, seem to be totally unsuitable  for such purposes. The two MI-8T are designed to fly KAM  commanders or some other high-ranking officials rather than for  combat purposes. [passage omitted]    New helicopters MI-8T and MI-8MTV, bought directly from the  Russian association "Aviaeksport," cost $1.2 and $1.7 million,  respectively. This Russian enterprise itself delivers aircraft  to customers, issues the necessary technical documentation,  provides a full set of spare parts, gives a guarantee for three  and a half or four years, and assumes the commitment of  repairing all failures over this period. The aforementioned  prices apply to all CIS states and the so-called "near abroad"  countries. Certainly, similar Western helicopters are more  expensive, however, their quality seems to be ten-times higher.  The Transportation Ministry experts' commission, which had the  instruction to inspect and assess the aircraft acquired by the  KAM, noted that one could buy cheaper and brand-new MI-8T or  MI-8MTV from Russia. For example, the aircraft plant in Kazan  can sell helicopters of these types at contract prices ranging  from $900,000 to $1 million. Prices at other Russian  enterprises dealing in helicopters are similar. And one more  thing. The air company "Cheremshanka" from Krasnoyarsk offered  the same type of helicopter for sale to Lithuania as the one  bought for $750,000-800,000 as far back as March of 1993.  However, the KAM leaders were not interested in any other  partners or offers of cheaper and newer aircraft for some reason.    On 10 June 1993, [former] Defense Minister A. Butkevicius  informed Prime Minister A. Slezevicius that the "KAM had  received a number of commercial bids to acquire MI-8MTV  helicopters of different models" for prices ranging from  $900,000 to $1.6 million. According to A. Butkevicius, one of  the most acceptable offers had come from the closed stock  company "Akvel." The helicopter proposed by this company was in  Lithuania. Moreover, the KAM Air Force had received all  documentation, the helicopter had undergone technical  inspection, and there had been several test flights. A.  Butkevicius reported to the prime minister that the helicopter  was suitable for operation, and that the Air Force was ready to  take it. A. Butkevicius requested the additional millions of  dollars from the prime minister.    Did the government show any interest in what helicopter  offers the KAM had received? Was it really positive before  assigning millions of dollars that these helicopters would be  new and with all the necessary parts and documentation? Was it  not possible to acquire newer aircraft for the same amount of  money abroad?... The government did nothing of the kind. It  seems that its leaders trusted Minister A. Butkevicius and his  relations with people of dubious reputation.    The certificate signed by Air Force Commander Z.  Vegelevicius, which RESPUBLIKA has today, reads that the  helicopters offered for sale by both "Akvel" and "Mingrin" are  new. However, it was noticed on 17 September 1993, while  receiving the first helicopter from the company "Akvel" in the  Siauliai region, that it lacked dozens or even hundreds of spare  parts and some equipment. The same applied to the helicopters  acquired from the "Mingrin" company in November. These aircraft  were received by ordinary local air base employees -- a  commission headed by Captain A. Baskevicius. The statements of  transfer did not indicate the suppliers' names. The fact that  the helicopters worth millions of dollars were accepted by local  air base employees is surprising. The entire leadership of the  Air Force and the Defense Ministry itself avoided the signing of  any documents at that time. It was such a responsibility and a  risk! One could understand that the leaders would have to  account for this deal sooner or later. Law enforcement  officials, to whom I have talked recently, doubt whether the  companies "Akvel" and "Mingrin" had acquired those helicopters  legally. They might have been stolen! No provisional  certificates of their suitability for use or a document that  they had been erased from Russia's state air register were  provided during the transaction. Nor is there any such  documentation as of today. In addition, the Transportation  Ministry experts' commission, which was authorized to assess the  state of the helicopters, the legal basis and the expediency of  the deal, believes that the KAM price commission behaved  frivolously by approving the decision of the ministry's  leadership to waste millions of dollars from the state's  pocketbook.</p>

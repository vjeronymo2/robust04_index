			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Book Review: Bedrock trade unionism lives on THE FUTURE OF THE TRADE UNIONS By Robert Taylor Andre Deutsch Pounds 9.99. 238 pages Since 1979 British trade unions have lost about a third of their members, and union strength is now concentrated in the public services. Their membership is particularly weak among women and in business sectors showing the fastest employment growth. At the same time, union political power has been much weakened. The abolition of National Economic Development Office and other tripartite bodies has cut them out of much decision-making. And Tony Blair has clearly stated unions will not have a privileged position in relation to a future Labour government. It is not surprising, then, that there should be a debate about whether the movement has a future, in anything like its present form. The Future of the Trade Unions presents the case for the defence. Commissioned by the Trades Union Congress, the book is unashamed in advocating a strong future role for the unions. There is blush-inducing praise for general secretaries. We hear a lot of John Monks and Bill Jordan but, strangely, there is no mention of Arthur Scargill (or Jimmy Knapp), though John Edmonds is allowed a few observations. Reacting to the fall in membership he grumbles: 'Working people should be queueing up to join trade unions.' But Taylor's case, though highly partial, deserves attention. He says unions have begun to put their house in order and can look confidently to the future. His main reason for optimism is that the European Union is re-establishing a framework in which trade unions have a privileged position in policy-making. The 'social dialogue' formalised in the Maastricht treaty requires the Commission to consult employers and unions on projected social legislation. Agreements reached by the social partners can be adopted by the Council of Ministers. When this procedure was first tried - over European works councils - it did not result in agreement. Yet the Social Affairs Council seems likely to implement a directive establishing such councils, now called European committees, in big European companies (many with UK parents). British unions see a re-entry point here. As Taylor says in summarising his second argument: The EU has provided not just 'a lifeline for the trade unions, but the means for a potentially effective counter-offensive by organised labour for the rest of the 1990s'. His third argument is that the key to enhanced competitiveness is consensus in the workplace and unions are the path to this consensus. It sounds persuasive. So why are most employers still unconvinced that institutionalised works councils will help their businesses? And why do many prefer routes to better communication with their workforces which do not pass through union channels? There are two main reasons. First, UK employers note that elsewhere in Europe works councils are not exclusively union-based structures. In France, 'enterprise committees' represent the whole workforce. While union representation is often prominent, unionisation is remarkably weak. Yet many British trade unionists talk as if European works councils will re-establish unions' exclusivity. Mr Edmonds has said bluntly: 'If we succeed, works councils would become our dream solution to the problem of declining trade union power.' Taylor himself points out that instances in which the trade union is the single channel of representation are not compatible with support for universal civil rights for UK workers on a Continental model. But it is not clear that the British trade union movement has yet accepted this. Employers' second concern is that many union leaders seem still to believe the interests of employers and employees are mutually exclusive. Taylor's own writing provides two vivid examples. He contrasts British employers' 'commitment to deregulated labour markets' with the attitude 'of their European mainland counterparts who have a sense of social and ethical responsibility for the well-being of their employees'. Such generalisation is absurd and offensive. He argues, similarly, the decline of trade union-based collective bargaining means employers have no 'need to behave in a civilised manner towards their workers'. This ignores the point that well-treated, involved employees will show greater commitment to a business and be more productive. There are unscrupulous employers against whom individual employees need protection. But most companies do not see their relationship with employees as a zero-sum game. They are keen to develop participation, and surveys show they are, overall, succeeding. Employers are, today, not in principle hostile to unions. There is no evidence that they have forced the pace of union decline through derecognition. Indeed in the private sector union membership has fallen far faster than recognition. And very few employers now say they have been unable to achieve restructuring because of union obstructionism. But bad memories die hard, and have been reawakened by the behaviour of RMT, the transport union, in the rail dispute. (RMT is not mentioned by Taylor.) So employers will be reluctant to support a more prominent role in policy-making for trade unions, or Continental-style legislation, until more union leaders are ready to accept the consequences. That means greater identification with an enterprise's success and acceptance of non-union channels. Some in the union movement, notably the TUC leadership, understand the implications of those choices. But this book shows there are many Flintstones still on the general council. The author is director general of the Confederation of British Industry.</p>

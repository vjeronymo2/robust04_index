			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALBERT C. WEDEMEYER, 92; SOLDIER-DIPLOMAT HELPED SHAPE POSTWAR POLICIES  </P> <P> Albert Coady Wedemeyer, one of the few ranking staff officers who shaped  America's military strategy during World War II and its diplomatic policy in  the years immediately following, is dead.  </P> <P> The Associated Press reported Wednesday that the four-star general died Sunday  at a retirement center at Ft. Belvoir, Va. He was 92 and had been in declining  health after moving earlier this year to the Belvoir Woods Health Care Center  from the farm he called "Friends Advice" in the small community of Boyds, Md.  </P> <P> He died four decades after the disagreements that split American and British  planners had become the stuff of history.  </P> <P> Born in 1897 in Omaha, Wedemeyer entered West Point in 1915. He graduated in  1919, a member of a class that included such celebrated combat soldiers of  World War II as Anthony C. McAuliffe, commander of the 101st Airborne during  the Battle of the Bulge; Air Force Gen. Nathan Twining, later chairman of the  Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Al Gruenther, who would rise to become the supreme  commander in Europe.  </P> <P> But Wedemeyer's skills lay not in command, somewhat to his chagrin. Like his  mentor, George C. Marshall, Wedemeyer -- who longed for duty with troops --  found himself assigned to a prewar succession of staff positions.  </P> <P> Caught behind a large number of World War I veterans on the promotion lists,  Wedemeyer and his classmates spent 17 years as lieutenants, and four more as  captains. They finally achieved the rank of major in 1940 only after then-Chief  of Staff Marshall reformed the Army's promotion policies to eliminate what he  privately termed "the arteriosclerosis."  </P> <P> In the meantime, the young officer served on a succession of posts in the  caste-conscious, socially isolated peacetime Army -- at Ft. Benning, Ga.; twice  in the Philippines; in Washington, and in Tientsin, China, then widely regarded  as the Army's choicest assignment in those sleepy between-war years.  </P> <P> It was while traveling on an Army troopship to the Philippines in 1923 that the  lean, blond Wedemeyer met his future wife, Elizabeth Dade Embick, daughter of  an Army colonel.  </P> <P> They were married in 1925 on Corregidor Island in Manila Bay. Their first son  was born the following year, their second in 1928. Six grandchildren and nine  great-grandchildren also survive him.  </P> <P> Wedemeyer came to be a member of a small circle of soldier-scholars. Unlike  many, he was an outspoken supporter of Germany as a major power -- perhaps  because of his own Germanic heritage.  </P> <P> In June, 1936, the Army sent then-Capt. Wedemeyer to attend the German War  College in Berlin. (A handful of German officers were training at American  military schools.) The two-year tour had a profound influence on him and his  later career. He learned the evolving principles of blitzkrieg and the  Luftwaffe's innovative use of aircraft as artillery for fast-moving armored  columns. He also came to share the German general staff's realpolitik and its  abiding antipathy to the Soviet Union. Wedemeyer returned to the United States  as one of the few men in the U.S. Army with an appreciation for the war-making  machine that the Wehrmacht would unloose in September, 1939. He also returned a  fervent anti-communist.  </P> <P> "I was convinced that the American people did not want to supplant Nazism by  communism," he wrote in his best-selling autobiography, "Wedemeyer Reports!"  </P> <P> That prejudice was to cloud his future career as a diplomat, although Marshall  would remain a stalwart defender of the newly promoted major he assigned in  1941 to the war plans division of the General Staff.  </P> <P> Almost immediately Marshall -- who had trouble remembering names -- put "that  long-legged major in war plans" to work on the so-called Victory Program, the  secret, vitally important national estimate of what manpower and industry were  necessary to defeat the Axis.  </P> <P> Thus Wedemeyer found himself, ironically, drafting the master industrialization  plan that would lead to the defeat of a nation he admired, Germany, while the  United States allied itself with a political system, communism, that he  despised.  </P> <P> Mountbatten's Deputy  </P> <P> It was at the 1943 Quebec Conference that British Adm. Louis Mountbatten asked  for Wedemeyer to serve as his deputy in the newly created Southeast Asia  Command. Marshall agreed, and Wedemeyer, by then a two-star general, found  himself in New Delhi.  </P> <P> On Oct. 28, 1944, Marshall ordered Wedemeyer's transfer to Chongqing, China, to  replace the outspoken Joseph (Vinegar Joe) Stilwell as commander of the China  Theater. More important, Wedemeyer was also to assume Stilwell's post as chief  of staff to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, the Chinese Nationalist leader.  </P> <P> "My orders for assignment to China came as a bombshell," Wedemeyer acknowledged  in his autobiography. Wedemeyer the soldier suddenly found himself in the  delicate position of diplomat with no training and no warning.  </P> <P> "Using honey for my part instead of vinegar," Wedemeyer sought to woo Chiang.  He was no more successful in convincing the generalissimo to field an army  against the Japanese than Stilwell had been. Instead, with Wedemeyer's tacit  cooperation, Chiang hoarded military supplies for the postwar struggle with Mao  Zedong's communist forces. "Although it took me some time to acquire  confirmation of the ruthless objectives of the Chinese communists, I had no  illusions concerning them from the outset," Wedemeyer said later.  </P> <P> The war ended with Chiang jockeying for position with the communists in a  renewal of civil war that had wracked that country since the early years of the  century.  </P> <P> When the U.S. ambassador to Chongqing, Patrick V. Hurley, resigned in 1945, his  political duties fell to Wedemeyer. By then a three-star general, Wedemeyer  thus became the first of the military men who would redirect American  diplomatic policy in the decisive years after the war. (That group included,  among others, Gen. Walter Bedell Smith, later ambassador to the Soviet Union;  Gen. Lucius D. Clay, U.S. high commissioner in West Germany; and two future  secretaries of state, Chief of Staff Marshall, and a young colonel then on  Wedemeyer's staff, Dean Rusk.)  </P> <P> Wedemeyer lined up behind Chiang, despite "the weaknesses and the oppressive  character of the Nationalist government and its decreasing popular support," as  he wrote later. But "communist totalitarian tyranny would be infinitely worse,"  he continued.  </P> <P> Wedemeyer found himself at odds with the policies of his former chief,  Marshall, who spent 1946 as a special envoy in China attempting to end the  civil war in that weary nation.  </P> <P> Marshall, Wedemeyer wrote in his autobiography, "approached the problem of  unifying China on the false supposition that the Chinese communists were not  real communists under Moscow's command but simply a Chinese faction that could  be induced by diplomatic negotiations to come to terms with the Nationalist  government."  </P> <P> Effort Collapses  </P> <P> Marshall's yearlong effort to sponsor a coalition government in postwar China  collapsed, leaving Chiang's Nationalists to futilely fight off Mao Zedong's  communists. Inexorably, communist field armies pushed Chiang's beleaguered  forces into smaller and smaller pockets.  </P> <P> When the Nationalists fled to Formosa in 1949, Republican Party leaders,  including the querulous Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy of Wisconsin, demanded to know  "who lost China." Seeking to embarrass President Harry S. Truman and the  Democratic Party, McCarthy and other members of what would become known as "the  China Lobby" attacked Marshall as a traitor.  </P> <P> Wedemeyer, named ambassador to China in l947, found himself at the center of  one of these "who-lost-China" squabbles when his report on the Nationalist  government was suppressed by Truman. GOP spokesmen charged that the report was  withheld from the public because Wedemeyer, by now considered an expert on  China, had contradicted Truman's policies.  </P> <P> In fact, Marshall, then secretary of state, had recommended embargoing the  Wedemeyer report -- finally released two years later -- because it described  the Nationalist government as "corrupt, reactionary and inefficient," so much  so that it could not win the loyalty of the people of China.  </P> <P> But Chiang's partisans in the United States chose to ignore the criticism and  hear only Wedemeyer's call for the communists to lay down their arms.  </P> <P> Controversial Report  </P> <P> In 1947, Wedemeyer authored a report on China and Korea that called, among  other things, for an American-directed, South Korean force capable of defeating  any Soviet-supported invasion from the north. The report was considered so  controversial that President Truman decided not to make it public.  </P> <P> Wedemeyer's frustration led to his retirement in 1951. The following year he  backed conservative Sen. Robert Taft (R-Ohio), but then supported the GOP  ticket headed by his old friend from the war plans division, Dwight D.  Eisenhower.  </P> <P> In 1956, he retired from business to write his book, and to take on the role of  senior statesman. He was 59 and he had, in the words of the oblique Chinese  curse, "lived in interesting times."  </P> <P> Yet his moment had passed. Neither Eisenhower nor the much younger John F.  Kennedy called upon Wedemeyer to serve as one of their foreign policy wise men.  The first found him too soft, his anti-communism always tempered by practical  realpolitik; the second found him a relic of another era.  </P> <P> He would live in retirement at his farm through successive administrations,  attending annual Bohemian Club gatherings north of San Francisco, staying in  touch with many of the nation's most influential, but no longer himself at the  heart of great events.  </P> <P> In 1985, he was awarded the nation's highest civilian honor, the Medal of  Freedom, by President Ronald Reagan.  </P></p>

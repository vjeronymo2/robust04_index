			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> VAN DE KAMP CALLS UTILITY MERGER 'A BAD DEAL';  </P> <P> UTILITIES: PLAN ALSO WOULD WORSEN AIR POLLUTION IN LOS ANGELES, VIOLATES  ANTITRUST LAWS, ATTORNEY GENERAL SAYS.  </P> <P> Southern California Edison's proposal to create the nation's largest electric  utility by merging with San Diego Gas &amp; Electric violates antitrust laws  and would damage air quality in the Los Angeles Basin, state Atty. Gen. John  Van de Kamp said Wednesday.  </P> <P> At press conferences in San Diego and Los Angeles, Van de Kamp described the  $2.5-billion stock-swap merger as "not in the public interest . . . . From what  I've seen thus far, this corporate marriage appears to be a bad deal for  everyone except" Edison.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp, who questioned whether the proposed merger would generate lower  rates for current Edison customers, also expressed doubt that state regulators  would allow Edison to fulfill a pledge to cut electric rates in San Diego and  southern Orange counties by 10% after the merger is completed.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp will oppose the proposed merger during regulatory reviews under way  by the state Public Utilities Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission.  </P> <P> However, Van de Kamp said it was premature to consider a court challenge  because state and federal regulators have not yet completed their reviews. He  said he will not consider court action until regulators have "played through  the entire administrative proceedings . . . that's the only appropriate thing  to do."  </P> <P> The PUC, which begins public hearings in April, hopes to deliver a ruling early  in 1991. Federal regulators, who begin merger-related hearings on Monday in  Washington, expect to complete their review by year's end.  </P> <P> In reply to Van de Kamp's charges, Edison vice president Louis Phelps said  Wednesday that they were "100% wrong."  </P> <P> "The merger will benefit consumers by providing $1.7 million in lower rates and  improved service," Phelps said in a prepared statement. The merger would  "result in cleaner air . . . (and) economic benefits to all of Southern  California. . . . And it does not result in adverse competitive impacts,"  Phelps said.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp denied that his opposition to the merger was linked to his bid to  be the Democratic gubernatorial candidate in November. He maintained that his  decision to oppose the merger was driven "by the evidence, which stands for  itself."  </P> <P> Van de Kamp said U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, the leading Republican candidate in the  governor's race, "has some amount of discretion" as to whether he should oppose  the merger. However, as a U.S. senator, Wilson will not play a "controlling"  role in whether the merger succeeds, Van de Kamp said.  </P> <P> Larry O'Donnell, chairman of San Diegans for the Merger, said Van de Kamp was  "carrying his gubernatorial campaign to Pete Wilson's back yard. . . . He's  read the polls (that show opposition to the merger) and is trying to  essentially run a . . . campaign . . . (on) the merger."  </P> <P> Van de Kamp acknowledged that the merger has drawn strong opposition from many  civic leaders in the county.  </P> <P> "San Diego does not want to become an energy suburb of Los Angeles County," Van  de Kamp said. "The loss of regional independence and local control are  legitimate concerns, precisely the kinds of concerns that prompted the passage  of antitrust laws in the first place.  </P> <P> "The people of Los Angeles are less interested in this merger than the people  of San Diego (because) it touches them less directly. (But) there are certainly  interests way beyond San Diego that are affected by this."  </P> <P> Van de Kamp charged that the merger could cause a dramatic increase in air  pollution in the Los Angeles Basin because Edison intends to use its excess  plant capacity there to generate power for use in San Diego. Edison has  maintained that air quality will not suffer because it is fitting its plants  with state-of-the-art pollution controls.  </P> <P> Spokesmen for smaller, municipal utilities, which operate in areas not served  by Edison, on Wednesday welcomed Van de Kamp's decision to oppose the merger.  </P> <P> "We're pleased that the attorney general has recognized the very real concern  of the municipal utilities regarding transmission access if a merger takes  place," said Jerry Jordan, executive director of the California Municipal  Utilities Assn.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp supported the municipal utilities' contention that the proposed  merger would cause antitrust problems because Edison would extend its already  impressive web of transmission lines leading in and out of Southern California.  </P> <P> Edison in the past has been sued by publicly owned utilities -- including  municipal systems owned by Anaheim, Azusa and Riverside -- for not granting  wider access to its electric transmission lines. Most of Southern California's  municipal utilities meet their customers' demand by using Edison's transmission  lines to import electric power generated by out-of-state utilities.  </P> <P> A merger with SDG&amp;E would give Edison "near-monopoly control of bulk power  production and transmission into and out of the entire Southern California  region," Van de Kamp said. "History teaches us that, over time, such power is  almost always used to enrich those who wield it at the expense of those who do  not."  </P> <P> Van de Kamp told Edison officials of his planned opposition last week during a  three-hour meeting. SDG&amp;E spokesman Tom Murnane said SDG&amp;E officials  were not invited to that meeting.  </P></p>

			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Flat demand balks British Vita Shares in British Vita fell 11p to 259p yesterday after the foam and fibre group said it had been hit by pricing pressures and flat demand in important markets. Although the group saw first-half pre-tax profits rise 46 per cent to Pounds 23.71m (Pounds 16.26m), it admitted that the figures were flattered by sizeable losses last time which disguised a more modest increase in operating profits. 'We are not seeing the kind of recovery that manufacturers of capital goods are enjoying,' said Mr Rod Sellers, chief executive. At the operating level, profits on continuing operations were almost unchanged at Pounds 21.39m (Pounds 20.08m) and Mr Sellers warned that the company's main markets were static or improving only slowly. Overall operating profits showed a healthier near Pounds 4m improvement, as the group benefited from the disposal last year of its debt-burdened Spanish subsidiaries - Icoa and Metzeler Laminados - which lost Pounds 2.62m last time. Without contributions from the two subsidiaries, turnover fell back to Pounds 388m (Pounds 404.4m), but their disposal helped lift pre-tax profits with Pounds 550,000 of interest receivable, against payments of Pounds 99,000. 'We've got rid of the problem businesses and although our markets are not booming we've seen a small upturn in all our divisions,' said Mr Sellers. That improvement was helped by last year's rationalisation programme, which saw the workforce cut by 5 per cent to 12,800 and costs adjusted to meet lower demand. Of the group's three divisions, cellular polymers - the largest - saw profits increase 8.6 per cent to Pounds 13.85m (Pounds 12.78m). The industrial polymers operation saw profits rise from Pounds 2.33m to Pounds 2.65m, and the fibres and fabrics division moved ahead 7.5 per cent to Pounds 3.69m (Pounds 3.43m). While welcoming the figures, Mr Sellers said recent trading had been quiet and it was unrealistic to expect a rapid increase in demand. Nevertheless, earnings per share rose 25 per cent to 7p (5.6p), after adjusting the 1993 figure by adding back the loss on the disposal of discontinued operations. An interim dividend of 3.75p (3.65p) has been declared. COMMENT British Vita is refreshingly candid about its prospects. It admits that its figures are fairly limp even after shedding the excess baggage which slowed it down during the worst of the recession. But the performance is not bad, given the margin pressures and increased raw material prices. To see any acceleration, it really needs to use its Pounds 32.5m reserves to make a cash-generative acquisition that would also boost market share. If it did that, then profits could exceed the Pounds 47m forecast for this year and make the shares - which reached 309p in April - worth considering on a forward multiple of 18.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The United Nations awaits the results of the  contacts of Robert Lamb, U.S. State Department special  coordinator on Cyprus, in Ankara before making public the UN  secretary general's report to the UN Security Council [UNSC]  regarding the talks on the confidence-building measures. A U.S.  official told Apostolis Zoumbaniotis, CyBC [Cyprus Broadcasting  Corporation] correspondent in New York, that the UN secretary  general's report is expected to finally be given to the Security  Council tomorrow.    The CyBC correspondent also reports that all indications are  that the Turkish side will be given 15 days to accept the  latest proposals of Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's  special representative for Cyprus, regarding the means of  implementing the confidence-building measures. The CyBC  correspondent reports the possibility of the Security Council  putting substantial pressure on the Turkish side is very slight  due to strong objections by the United States.    Security Council circles told the CyBC correspondent that it  can not be ruled out that after the expiration of the 15 day  time limit, President Glavkos Kliridhis and [Turkish Cypriot  Leader] Rauf Denktas will be invited to go to New York, either  to sign an agreement or for a coordinated effort to find a  compromise with the participation of the UN secretary general  and the five permanent members of the Security Council.</p>

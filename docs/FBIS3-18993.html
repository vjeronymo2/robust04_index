Recent events, especially  the Hebron massacre, were in the forefront at this time, as  participants observed a minute of silence in tribute to the  victims at the opening of the session. All the delegations  acknowledged the importance of continuing the peace process,  noted Mr. Claude Cheysson (Socialist, French) at the press  conference following the conclusion of the meeting.    Participants also insisted on the importance of providing  protection for the Palestinian population under United Nations  auspices.</p>

			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Unions offer Blair a deal on party link Unions have offered a deal to Mr Tony Blair, the new Labour leader, which would give him substantial freedom in policy-making in return for an agreement not to challenge further their constitutional position in the party. Many union leaders were taken aback by Mr Blair's statement last Friday that the unions would have no privileged place in the party. One union official said: 'Privately we were disappointed that the union issue was raised so quickly, but we decided not to react.' Union leaders, symbolically pushed to the back of the hall at Mr Blair's victory rally, know that they are not held in high esteem by the Blair camp, which believes they run increasingly unrepresentative bodies. But they have no strategy to challenge the Labour leader with motions on specific levels for a minimum wage or targets for reducing unemployment at this year's Trades Union Congress or Labour conferences. They do, however, believe that they can prevent Mr Blair re-opening the issue of their presence in the party after the defeat they suffered last year over one member, one vote. The settlement that the principal union power brokers are seeking is spelt out by Mr Tom Burlison, deputy general secretary of the GMB general union, in the latest issue of the New Statesman. He writes: 'Blair needs to consolidate the party constitution, while being radical in policy and presentation. 'If his programme of radical reform were to include the party constitution it would be a disaster. 'Those in the party who are embarrassed by the link have learnt to live with it, and the unions in turn have learned that their role in the party has to be legitimate. To upset that settlement would be suicide.' The Blair camp can probably accept a standstill on the formal union position in the party, which still includes a majority of the votes at party conference, a substantial presence on the national executive committee, and one-third of the votes to elect the leader. But union influence on policy is likely to diminish as think-tanks such as the Institute of Public Policy Research become more influential. One senior union official said: 'We are really being told by the Blair camp: 'If you've got something interesting to say, say it, but you no longer represent the majority of workers so we will make up our minds about whether to accept it or not'.'</p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Management: Entrepreneur in his natural habitat - Lucy Kellaway finds Sir Terence Conran as busy as ever / My Office According to Sir Terence Conran, the age of the office is over. The man who introduced Britain to stylish interiors sees a future in which people will work from home, meeting up for a friendly lunch in revamped Lyons' coffee houses. 'Imagine suffering the indignities of Network SouthEast to arrive at work in one of those towers,' he makes a disdainful gesture out of the window at the City of London. 'You would think: 'What the bloody hell am I doing here, sitting at a screen all day when I could be doing the same thing at home?'' This is vintage Sir Terence: bold, visionary and unrealistic. It is also a bit rich for him to speculate on the nightmares of working life as he sits in an office which he describes as 'perfect', adding that he 'feels quite embarrassed about it'. But he looks anything but embarrassed as he surveys his magnificent room. Some 50 feet long and 35 wide, it has large windows looking over the Thames and is light, comfortable and stylish. The room is part of a converted warehouse at Butler's Wharf, part of a Conran development that went bankrupt a year ago. Indeed, since Sir Terence resigned from his Storehouse retailing empire in 1990, he has suffered a good many blows. But you would not guess it from his poised look as he sits behind his desk - a huge piece of polished wood which he designed himself, and had workmen knock up in his private furniture factory in the country. He maintains that he is just as busy now with his scores of individual projects as he ever was running Storehouse: he has restaurants, a design company, his own foundation, the Conran shop, his books, chairmanship of the Design Museum. He runs through the list twice; evidently he does not think he is washed up and he is damned if anyone else is going to think it either. As one would expect, Sir Terence has strong feelings about what an office should be like. Its occupant 'must feel relaxed and comfortable in the space, which must reflect their personality. Work is a part of life.' So what does his office reflect about him? What would he think if he walked in for the first time? 'I'd think, how nice to have fresh air coming through the window. How interesting that the secretary almost shares the office with him, with only a sliding screen separating them.' Sir Terence makes much of the importance of nice surroundings for everyone. He says his suite of offices (originally designed as an apartment) work well for his staff of 10 or so. 'The communal kitchen is marvellous for them,' he says. 'They can make their toast in there in the morning.' In fact the kitchen is aggressively high-tech, and has nothing so homely as a table or chair. The secretary sits in a windowless anteroom, and the other staff are squeezed into small, plain rooms at the back. Until you see the boss's office, you might think you were in a start-up design company, cramped yet pleasantly informal: in the cupboard housing the photocopier, a bottle of wine serves as the doorstop. 'This is obviously the office of someone who likes art, pictures and sculpture,' he says, returning to his own room, 'and who has a sense of humour'. He points at a huge model of Tower Bridge on the sleek white board table; at the bronze Michelin man on the coffee table. But funniest of all is an ethnic bird, which he says is a jeweller's blow lamp. 'It makes me laugh like anything,' he says. The outsider might miss the joke, but what they could not miss is the identity of the occupant. The room could belong to no-one else but Terence Conran. Everywhere are signs of his successes and failures. There is the faultless good taste: an idiosyncratic combination of old and new, high-tech and ethnic, smooth and rough surfaces apparently put together effortlessly. There is the model of the Food Hall for Canary Wharf, a Conran project that went wrong. There is a shelf of children's books, published by Conran Octopus, of which he is still chairman. There is a large collection of books on design and taste, almost all of which he has written himself. He proudly holds out the latest to be examined and admired. There is a basket of swatches of coloured Indian cottons and some collages put together by prospective buyers for the Conran shop. Both betray a fanatical attention to detail that is fine for the head of a small company, but is misplaced in the boss of a big retailer. The room is littered with sculptures and pictures, many propped in piles on the floor, waiting for the right spot in one of his successful restaurants. Conran gives a bronze pillow with a fish on top a gentle kick: 'I bought that in the Islington crafts fair last week. I'm not sure what I want to do with it yet.' His desk is a happy jumble of colourful cigar boxes, a fat stub is burning in a glass ashtray, pens and pencils, photographs, catalogues, and piles of paper. There are empty cups of the strong coffee that his secretary makes, grinding the beans freshly each time. 'I try to keep things tidy, but there is so much stuff that crosses this desk. 'I have learnt that if you put things in an in-tray and let them mature, they self-destruct.' There are no desk drawers, no filing cabinets, certainly no computers. Sir Terence is no great organiser. The room is exactly as he likes, and one gets the impression he does what he likes. He may no longer be a powerful man in big business; judging by his office, he was never meant to be.</p>

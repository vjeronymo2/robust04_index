			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Amberley chairman to resign from board AMBERLEY GROUP, the USM-quoted building services company, is poised for expansion following the conditional sale of most of his holding by Mr Dennis Buckley, chairman, and his departure from the board. Hemery Nominees is buying 965,400 shares (14.99 per cent) at 27p leaving Mr Buckley with a 2.98 per cent holding. The shares gained 3p to close at 23p. Mr Brian Meddings, who was with BTP and Mr Robert Healey, who was with Hawley, are joining the board in an executive capacity. It is not yet known who will replace Mr Buckley as chairman. Mr Philip Kanas, a non-executive director of Amberley, said it was proposed to double or triple in size through acquisitions paid for by paper. The areas for growth would probably be away from the present building preservation services but still within building services. Amberley fell into Pounds 79,000 losses (Pounds 75,000 profits) on turnover of Pounds 1.62m (Pounds 1.59m) in the six months to September 30.</p>

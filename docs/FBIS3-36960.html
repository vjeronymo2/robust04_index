			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko by Rafael </F> Poch; place and date not given]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Poch] Kravchuk agreed in  Massandra last year to hand over the whole Black Sea Fleet to  Russia. Will that agreement be carried out?    [Zlenko] Kravchuk and Yeltsin had already discussed that  matter at meetings before Massandra, such as those in Yalta and  Dagomis. Ukraine's stance was clear. As an heir to the former  USSR, it is entitled to part of its property, including part of  the Black Sea Fleet. This fact, acknowledged by everybody, was  confirmed at the Yalta meeting. It was agreed there that the  Black Sea Fleet would be divided into two parts -- a Ukrainian  part and a Russian part -- and also that the fleet would remain  under joint command until complete agreement on its  apportionment. Proceeding from its economic and military  interests, Ukraine, as a sovereign state, is entitled to dispose  of its part of the fleet. That is why in Massandra Yeltsin and  Kravchuk signed a document which mentioned the possibility of  Ukraine's selling to Russia its part of the fleet. Following  Massandra, we are discussing aspects of the valuation and  apportionment of the fleet, but it is premature to speak of a  final agreement and even of its implementation.    [Poch] Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Tarasyuk said that any  attempt to exploit the situation in Crimea will call into  question the agreement on disarmament signed by Kravchuk,  Clinton, and Yeltsin. Are you making the disarmament agreement,  which has now been signed, conditional upon stability in Crimea?    [Zlenko] The situation in Crimea in general and its  presidential election are internal matters of Crimea and  Ukraine, and are outside the Foreign Ministry's scope. With  respect to the agreement's signatories' reactions to the  election, we do not see what you would call clear official  attempts on Russia's part to use the situation in Crimea to its  advantage. The United States has deemed Ukraine's stance on  this matter balanced, and has warned Russia against actions  which could destabilize the region.... Parliament's decision to  lift its conditions for the ratification of the START I  agreement and the Lisbon agreement should finally dispel any  doubt: Ukraine remains firm on the path of nuclear disarmament  and in its resolve to fulfill its international commitments,  including the tripartite agreement.    [Poch] CIA Director Woolsey has said that it is possible  that Ukraine will fragment over the next two years. Crimea and  the Donbass want at least greater integration with Russia.  Western Ukraine does not. What is the government's policy to  prevent Ukraine's disintegration?    [Zlenko] The danger of separatism must in no event be  underestimated.... We are aware of the economic, cultural, and  social differences which history has created in Ukraine's  various regions. Some irresponsible politicians, who, using the  economic problems, are repeatedly inspiring separatist ideas,  are trying to exploit them. However, even taking into account  the enormous difficulties existing in Ukraine today, I cannot  agree with the assertion that our state is on the verge of  disintegration.... Ukraine is one of the CIS' most stable  states, where the ethnic minorities' rights are respected.    [Poch] Russian nationalism, which is growing, is breaking  you up. Why do you not acknowledge that economic and military  reintegration with Russia is vital for Ukraine?    [Zlenko] We deem it a priority to develop good-neighborly  relations with Russia.... Far from rejecting economic relations  with Moscow and the CIS, we wish to bring them to a new  qualitative level. As far as military union is concerned,  Ukraine's stance was laid down in the declaration of  sovereignty, which says that we are a neutral state.</p>

			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GARDEN GROVE LEAGUE FOOTBALL;  </P> <P> LA QUINTA HELPS CLEAR TITLE PATH BY EDGING RANCHO ALAMITOS  </P> <P> La Quinta High School did not clinch the Garden Grove League title Thursday  night, but the Aztecs definitely moved one of their biggest obstacles out of  the way.  </P> <P> The Aztecs (6-0 overall, 3-0 in league) relied on the pass-catching and running  of Walter Dawkins and another exceptional performance by its defense to beat  previously undefeated Rancho Alamitos, 10-7, in front of about 3,000 at Bolsa  Grande High.  </P> <P> La Quinta entered the game as the county's No. 10 team, two positions below  Rancho Alamitos (5-1, 2-1), and with a two-game winning streak over the  Vaqueros. Rancho Alamitos presented a menacing offense that had scored 188  points.  </P> <P> But Thursday, Rancho Alamitos and its speedy tailback, Ulysses Trammell,  couldn't generate many scoring opportunities.  </P> <P> Things at least started well for Rancho Alamitos.  </P> <P> The Vaqueros went to their bread-and-butter ground game on their first  possession, as Trammell carried the ball nine times in a 13-play, 76-yard drive  that included runs of 17 and 14 yards. He wrapped up the 6 1/2-minute march  with a three-yard sweep around left tackle to give Rancho Alamitos a 7-0 lead.  </P> <P> It was an impressive display of ball control by the Vaqueros, but La Quinta  Coach Roger Takahashi apparently did a good job convincing his players the  touchdown didn't spell doomsday.  </P> <P> "We told the kids not to panic after their first score. We settled them down,"  Takahashi said.  </P> <P> La Quinta rebounded early in the second quarter on a 32-yard field goal by Mike  Berg and a 32-yard scoring pass from quarterback Donald Hopkins to Dawkins with  4 minutes and 41 seconds remaining before halftime.  </P> <P> Dawkins, who caught five passes for 83 yards and had eight carries for 54  yards, outjumped a Rancho Alamitos defender for the reception.  </P> <P> Rancho Alamitos had a pair of scoring opportunities thwarted in the fourth  quarter. The first ended on a block by La Quinta defensive back George Sanchez  of a 44-yard field goal attempt by Carl Foss. The second came a few minutes  later, on a fourth-and-three situation at the La Quinta 33. Quarterback Chris  Singletary fumbled the snap and Hopkins recovered.  </P> <P> Trammell, who last week ran for 244 yards against Kennedy, was held to 90 yards  in 21 carries. He had a couple big gains nullified by penalties.  </P> <P> "We committed suicide with all the mistakes and penalties," Rancho Alamitos  Coach Mark Miller said.  </P></p>

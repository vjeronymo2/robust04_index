			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 17 Apr (MENA)--Ambassador Badr Hamman,  assistant foreign minister for Arab affairs, left Cairo for  Sanaa as President Mubarak's special envoy this afternoon. He  will deliver two messages to Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih and Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, secretary general of  the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP].    Ambassador Hammam said before leaving that the two messages  deal with Egyptian-Yemeni relations and the Egyptian view of the  Yemeni situation and stress the need for cooperation among all  the Yemeni parties to surmount the situation in the country.    Hammam pointed out that his mission in Yemen falls within  the  context of the continuing Egyptian role of helping brother  Yemenis overcome the situation the country has been encountering  since last August. This role also seeks to preserve Yemeni  unity and implement the pledge and accord document approved and  signed by all the political parties in the Jordanian capital,  Amman, on 20 February, he explained.    The Egyptian official added: We are confident that the  political leaders in Yemen know of their responsibility to  foster and maintain unity. We will cooperate together to  achieve the collective goal of all the Yemeni parties, he said,  adding: We will try to provide favorable conditions and common  ground for bringing the parties together to overcome the crisis.</p>

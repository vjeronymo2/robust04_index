			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Capt. Alexander G. Balian, ending his testimony at his court-martial in the  Philippines, said that any Navy captain who encounters refugees at sea in the  future "would be stupid" if he doesn't pick them up. Balian, 48, is charged  with dereliction of duty for failing to rescue a group of Vietnamese refugees  last June 9 in the South China Sea who later resorted to cannibalism before  being rescued by Filipino fishermen after 37 days at sea. In the wake of that  incident, Vice Adm. George W. Davis Jr., then commander of the Pacific fleet,  sent a letter telling captains that assisting those in distress in peacetime  takes precedence over any other commitment. Balian alluded to that directive in  saying it would be "stupid" to pass up refugees.  </P></p>

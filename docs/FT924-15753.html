			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Shares in Forte rise despite profit fall FORTE, the hotel and restaurant group, yesterday unveiled interim profits at the lowest end of City expectations, warned of a difficult second half, failed to announce hoped-for board changes - and was rewarded with a 14p jump in its share price to 149p. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 24m for the six months to end-July were down 43 per cent on last year and Mr Rocco Forte, chief executive, warned: 'The remainder of the year will not be easy.' The group defied the prediction of some analysts that it would announce the appointment of two new non-executive directors or unveil other board changes, possibly including the retirement of Lord Forte, the founder and chairman. Mr Forte said, however, that the company was giving 'serious consideration' to the composition of the board. 'I would be very surprised if you don't hear something in the next six months,' he said. Although Mr Forte said cost reductions had produced improved August and September profits, Mr Paul Slattery of Kleinwort Benson said he thought yesterday's share price increase was overdone. 'A lot of people are expecting far too much of a turnround far too quickly,' he said. Mr Peter Hilliar of Barclays de Zoete Wedd said, however, that the increase stemmed from a belief that trading conditions were past their worst. In spite of the fall at the pre-tax level, trading profits rose 2 per cent to Pounds 93m. Sales were Pounds 1.36bn, up 3 per cent. The slight improvement in trading profit was achieved in spite of an increase in the depreciation charge from Pounds 43m to Pounds 49m. Mr Forte said Pounds 26m in cost reductions had helped improve operating margins. However, interest charges were Pounds 61m, compared with Pounds 51m last time - a result, Mr Forte said, of substantial recent investment. This included refurbishments at the Grosvenor House, Browns and Waldorf hotels in London. The Pounds 1.295m net borrowings at the end of the half year showed little change from the start of the year. The interim dividend was maintained at 2.75p on earnings per share down to 1.6p. Lex, Page 24; Market report, Page 44</p>

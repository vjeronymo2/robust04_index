The delegation, headed by Kyrgyz parliament chairman  Medetkan  Sherimkulov, is made up of representatives of Russia, Kyrgyzia  and Belarus. The CIS parliamentarians are scheduled to visit  Baku, Yerevan and Stepanakert, and meet Azerbaijani, Armenian  and Nagorno-Karabakh leaders.    The previous tour by CIS lawmakers of the Transcaucasia with  a peacekeeping mission was taken last September. The  parliamentarians met for three times with Azerbaijani President  Geydar Aliyev, discussed the possibilities of resolving the  crisis with Armanian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan and the  Nagorno-Karabakh leadership. The delegation also visited  Azerbaijan's border regions and makeshift camps of refugees in  the Belyagan and Barda districts, met heads of district  administrations. The tour resulted in an agreement between the  CIS parliamentary delegation and the Karabakh leaders about a  month-long ceasefire and partial return of refugees to their  homes. According to the lawmakers, to finally settle the  Karabakh conflict, the warring sides will need time, patience  and negotiating skills.    A new impetus was imparted to CIS parliamentarians'  peacekeeping efforts by the Moscow meeting of Armenian and  Azerbaijani defence ministers with the participation of a  Nagorno-Karabakh representative. The meeting was held in  February at the initiative of the Russian defence minister and  resulted in an agreement on a complete ceasefire and gradual  settlement of the conflict.    Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev met on Wednesday  with  Sherimkulov to discuss the forthcoming trip by the CIS  Interparliamentary Assembly mission to Nagorno-Karabakh.    After the meeting, the Kyrgyz parliament speaker told TASS  that at the moment the interparliamentary peacekeeping group was  arranging a meeting of Armenian, Azerbaijani and Karabakh  lawmakers in the Kyrgyz capital of Bishkek.    "We would like to hope that our activities will help restore  peace. People are tired of war, of increasing numbers of  refugees. None of the states will profit by this", Sherimkulov  stressed. "if we manage to promote rapprochement between the  warring sides, we would consider our mission helpful", he said.    A senior official of the Russian Foreign Ministry told  reporters that the ministry fully supported the intention of the  CIS Interparliamentary Assembly's peacekeeping group to promote  the Nagorno-Karabakh settlement. According to him, the Russian  Foreign Ministry "is working in close coordination (with the  group) and is ready to render an expert assistance in the  activities conducted by the group". Russian diplomats beleive  this group "may play a special role, since parliamentarians can  help create a favourable atmosphere for concluding an agreement,  which is presently being drafted by executive structures".    According to the Foreign Ministry high-ranking official, the  main thing to do now is "to bring the sides together, to create  a proper atmosphere for signing an agreement to halt the  conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh". The agreement has already being  worked out in principle. Each of the conflicting sides has its  own approaches, therefore it will certainly take much effort to  have the agreement signed, the diplomat stressed.</p>

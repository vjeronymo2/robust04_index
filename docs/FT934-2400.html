The cost of winding down MAM Leisure, the amusement machine subsidiary, is thought to account for more than Pounds 10m of the deficit. About Pounds 4.5m of losses came from operating activities, of which about Pounds 1m is thought to have been lost in continuing businesses. With the disposal of the amusement machine subsidiary, Chrysalis is now concentrating on music, visual entertainment, radio and its Lasgo export business. Last August, the group officially re-entered the music business, nearly two years after selling its recording interests to Thorn EMI. Its new label, Echo, is headed by Mr Steve Lewis, former managing director of Virgin Music. Last September, Chrysalis announced that Pony Canyon, the music division of Fujisankei, the Japanese communications group, had agreed to buy a 25.1 per cent stake in Echo for Dollars 17.5m (Pounds 11.7m).</p>

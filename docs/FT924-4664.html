			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / International Company News: May Stores ponders rival bid MAY Department Stores, the St Louis-based retailer that includes the Payless shoe store chain, said yesterday that it had asked the board of Morse Shoe to provide information on a proposed merger with J. Baker, the footwear group, and that May might be willing to make a rival offer of Dollars 55m for Morse Shoe. The company said that the purpose of acquiring Morse would be to step up its presence in the north-eastern US generally and in the New York area in particular. May said that, if the bid went ahead, it would be an all-cash offer.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Yarding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (h)(5) specifies various work practice requirements covering yarding activities. Paragraph (h)(5)(i) of the final rule requires that logs not be moved until each employee is in the clear. This provision has been adopted from the proposed rule. Movement of logs when employees are in the immediate area can result in an injury to those employees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to the WIR survey, almost 20 percent of employees injured were involved in yarding operations at the time of their accident (Ex. 2&hyph;1). When a log is moved on uneven, unimproved terrain, the exact path that the log will follow is impossible to predict. When they are being moved, logs may roll over, or the loose end of a log may flip back and forth (fishtail). Movement in an unanticipated direction can cause the log to strike an employee, causing serious injury. OSHA has included this requirement in the final rule to ensure that when logs are moved, all personnel must be safely positioned and not exposed to a hazard. OSHA did not receive any comments opposing this provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (h)(5)(ii) of the final rule requires that each choker be hooked and unhooked from the uphill side or end of the tree or log when rolling or sliding is reasonably foreseeable, unless the employer demonstrates that it is not feasible in the particular situation to hook or unhook the choker from the uphill side. This provision also requires that when the choker is hooked or unhooked from the downhill side, the log shall be securely blocked or chocked to prevent rolling or swinging. The proposed rule also specified that chokers be hooked and unhooked from the uphill side when feasible unless the log is securely blocked to prevent rolling or swinging. The 1978 ANSI logging standard also contained a similar requirement. There were no comments opposing this provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Employees who hook and unhook chokers on sloping terrains face the same hazard of rolling or sliding logs as do fellers, buckers, limbers and other employees. According to the WIR survey, 19 percent of the injuries reported occurred during choker setting, hooking and unhooking (Ex. 2&hyph;1). In addition, the WIR survey indicates that nearly three-fifths of all workers injured were working on moderate to steep terrain at the time of their accidents. The final rule makes clear OSHA's intention that all hooking and unhooking of chokers must be from the uphill side or end when rolling or sliding is reasonably foreseeable. This is the only work location in which it can be assured that an employee will not be hurt by a rolling or sliding tree. For this reason, hooking or unhooking chokers from the downhill side is not permitted simply because the tree has been secured with a chock. Rather, the employer must evaluate on a case-by-case basis whether it is possible to hook or unhook from the uphill side. Only when the employer has demonstrated that hooking or unhooking the choker from the uphill side or end is not feasible in the particular situation is hooking or unhooking the choker from the down hill side permitted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (h)(5)(iii) of the final rule requires that each choker be positioned near the end of the log or tree length. This provision was adopted from the proposed rule. There were no comments opposing this provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Positioning a choker at the end of the log ensures that the log is moved along its longitudinal axis. Hooking up and skidding a tree or log requires much less energy than trying to move the tree or log sideways. If an employee were to try to move a tree or log by dragging it sideways (perpendicular to its longitudinal axis) the tree or log could become wedged behind another tree, a rock, or a stump, causing the premature failure of the haulage equipment and the possibility of employee injury if the restraint were to suddenly break or release the tree or log. Because of these hazards, the usual practice in non-cable yarding is to skid or drag a tree or log when moving it. When trees or logs are skidded, the choker is hooked to the end of the tree or log and it is pulled along the ground.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (h)(5)(iv) of the final rule requires that each machine be positioned during winching so the machine and winch are operated within their design limits. The proposed rule required that the machine be positioned so that the winch line is as near in alignment as possible with the long axis of the machine, unless the machine is designed to be used under different conditions of alignment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter opposed the proposed provision for several reasons (Ex. 5&hyph;34). First, the commenter said that some machines, such as cats and skidders, are designed to sustain winching strain from a much broader angle than straight behind the machine, therefore, the proposed provision was needlessly restrictive if the machine is being operated within its rated capacity. Second, the commenter said it was not possible to comply with the provision in many situations. For example, the commenter said arches are normally equipped with fairleads and grapples that swing sideways out of alignment with the long axis of the machine. Third, the commenter said the provision would create a greater hazard when winching is conducted on very steep terrain. In such cases, the commenter said, it is more important that the machine be positioned to assure maximum stability rather than positioning the machine relative to the log being winched.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA recognizes that exact alignment is not always possible in the woods. OSHA also recognizes that a machine may have a winch mounted on it that may work off the side or front of the machine, and that aligning the winch line with the long axis of the machine may not be the safest manner to operate the winch.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Russia to lease first western airliners in Dollars 400m Airbus deal AIRBUS Industrie, the European aircraft consortium, is expected to deliver the first western-built aircraft to Russia next week, after arranging lease financing to support the sale of the five A310 wide-body airliners worth about Dollars 400m (Pounds 220m). The aircraft will be delivered to Russian International Airlines, a new carrier formed to operate the five Airbus airliners on long-distance services from Moscow to the Far East, Mr Adam Brown, Airbus director of planning, said. The new carrier is a subsidiary of Aeroflot, the former Soviet carrier now undergoing change following creation of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Airbus has agreed to assume the financial risks of the leasing arrangements to enable the delivery of the A310s to go ahead after all the national export credit agencies declined to support the deal. Aeroflot originally signed a purchase agreement for the five airliners in 1990 for delivery starting January this year. But the political situation in the former Soviet Union made financing the sale extremely difficult. Mr Brown said Airbus had now received 'full support' from the Russian government, clearing the way for the consortium to arrange lease financing 'on reasonable terms'. The first A310 is expected to be delivered next Monday and the remaining four by the end of July. Two aircraft have been sitting at Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, south-west France, waiting for the financing to be completed. Aeroflot had intended to use its first western-built airliners to operate Moscow to New York services. Airbus has also entered into a number of co-operation agreements with the CIS aerospace industry. These include: An agreement with the Russia Institute of Aviation Materials (VIAM) to test light-weight lithium-bearing aluminium alloys which could eventually be used more extensively on the new Airbus A330/340 wide-body airliner family; A contract with the Russian-British joint venture Heavylift Volga-Dnepr to lease large Antonov AN-124 cargo aircraft to transport equipment between the various Airbus plants in Europe; Use of wind-testing facilities near Moscow. Though no serious discussions have started, Mr Brown said Airbus was interested in co-operating on joint production of aircraft with CIS manufacturers aimed mainly at the new aircraft requirements of the CIS. He suggested the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development could help finance such a venture. However, he said there was unlikely to be any significant growth in air traffic in the CIS before the turn of the century. 'In the short and medium term, traffic within the region is likely to decline as the bulk of the population devotes its limited economic resources to satisfy needs for basic consumer commodities before turning to air travel,' he said.

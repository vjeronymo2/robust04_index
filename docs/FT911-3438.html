			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Survey of China (11): Old tune is heard again - Stock market's quiet return in an old hotel ballroom SHANGHAI'S old and distinguished Astor Hotel, located at the end of the riverside Bund which housed the city's former financial centre, has a new lease of life, writes John Elliott. With a nice touch of irony which officials insist is accidental, half of its premises (now renamed the Pujiang Hotel) have been converted to house Shanghai's fledgling stock exchange which was formally opened with much fanfare last December. A grand and renovated wood-panelled entrance hall leads to the old Astor ballroom where the tunes of foxtrots and waltzes have been replaced by the silence of numbers flickering on a large prices screen and about 25 or so computer terminals, surrounded by red-jacketed jobbers. Poorly dressed men and women queue on the pavement outside to place their savings, while others less well off peer uncertainly through the front door at this rather unlikely re-emergence of capitalism in Communist China. But this does not mark an imminent conversion of China's centrally planned and provincially controlled economy into a share-owning society  - and it may well be years before one can safely forecast whether this very cautious and hesitant experiment will have any significant impact on the country's economy. In a small way, however, it is a significant development - along with a more unruly stock market in the southern special economic zone of Shenzhen, adjacent to Hong Kong, and a nation-wide treasury bond trading system, called Securities Automated Quotations System (STAQ) which was launched in Peking last December, linking six cities and 18 licensed trading corporations. Guangzhou, capital of the southern province of Guangdong, is also considering a stock exchange. The significance is that there are sufficient economic reformers in Peking and elsewhere to push the experiments through, despite the ideological opposition of officials who fear both the economic and social implications, and despite the country's political uncertainty which deters bureaucratic initiative. The central government wants to try to ease its acute cash shortage by encouraging secondary markets for about yuan 114bn bonds already in circulation, and by tapping an estimated total of yuan 700bn-1,000bn personal savings. In Shanghai, there were extra reasons last December for formalising local bond and share trading which had been taking place since the mid-1980s across banking counters and on kerb-sides in seven or eight company stocks and 25 bonds issued by the government, financial institutions and companies. Peking wants to recreate Shanghai as China's financial capital and it also wants to attract funds for an ambitious Dollars 10bn industrial and commercial development planned in an area of Shanghai called Pudong. 'The securities market is a long term aim to develop a financial market which will help to finance Pudong and will introduce market mechanisms into resource allocation and company management,' says Mr He Gaosheng, director of the Office of Shanghai Economic System Reform. 'But public ownership will remain the mainstay, and the share system will not become very important - it is only on trial at present and that will last for perhaps five or ten years or more.' At least some claim of the quoted companies say they have new managerial freedom, even though the government is still effectively in control. 'We have more autonomy in our management and less direct intervention by the government so we make quicker decisions on investment and other issues,' says Mr Liang Zhengsheng, vice general manager of Shanghai Vacuum Electron Device, an amalgamation of six factories producing television tubes and other electrical goods which in 1987 became the first government-owned enterprise to have shareholders. Shanghai's Developments were held up by China's economic rectification policy of the past two years, but the potential has been demonstrated since December. Trading, which is dominated by the bond market, has rocketed from an average of yuan 6m a day in December to yuan 42m a day last month. Mr Wei Wenyuan, general manager of the exchange, forecasts that it could reach yuan 6bn this year, up from yuan 2.4bn last year and yuan 800m in 1989. An estimated 1m people out of Shanghai's 13m population are believed to have participated in securities transactions. Institutions such as insurance companies, labour unions and workers retirement funds are estimated to account for about 40 per cent of the trading, and the rest is by individuals. There are various forecasts about how fast the market will grow. The bond business might double in a year or so but the speed of the introduction of new companies is less clear. Plans are being drawn up - but could take some time to come into force  - to allow foreign investors to buy a special designation of B shares in certain companies and at least one foreign joint venture has applied to be quoted. In Shenzhen, where trading began in 1987, transactions last year totalled yuan 1.77bn, mainly in equities. There are only five listed companies and there was such rampant speculation last year, much on a kerb-side black market and involving local officials, that government restrictions were imposed and formal approval for the opening of a new stock exchange headquarters and trading floor was delayed. Such problems underline why there is deep suspicion and concern about allowing any rapid expansion.</p>

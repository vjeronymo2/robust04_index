			<p>BFN     [Text] Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer has set up a  commission to enforce the embargo against Haiti. This commission  -- made up of the Armed Forces minister, the military chiefs of  the general staff, and the Army -- will have to solicit from the  United Nations, through the pertinent institutions, the logistic  support it needs to do its job.    This measure by President Balaguer comes after U.S.  Democratic congressmen asked him to assume a more responsible  attitude so as to put an end to the flood of goods that cross  the border between the Dominican Republic and Haiti daily.    According to the Dominican newspaper (LA PRENSA), this  trafficking takes place with the conspicuous complicity of the  Dominican border guards and other Dominican citizens.  Information from Washington says the State Department hopes  Balaguer will ask for UN monitors, so as to strengthen  surveillance along the Haitian-Dominican border.    Observers think this Dominican Government decision to form a  commission with the mission of strengthening surveillance along  the border is a compromise that has been reached among the  divers lobbies in the Dominican Republic and the United States  that criticize international sanctions against Haiti.    Analysts say, furthermore, that Balaguer has exhibited a  position hostile to President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who  accuses him of encouraging the hiring of thousands of Haitians  for the Dominican sugarcane plantations [batey].    President Aristide has stated that the Haitian workers are  treated like slaves in the Dominican Republic, living under  subhuman conditions -- without running water, electricity, or  social assistance -- and working for pathetic wages.    It should be recalled that Balaguer's response to this  accusation was a massive deportation of Haitians.</p>

			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Water companies curb price changes All large water companies in England and Wales have now agreed to reduce the scope for changing price limits between regulatory reviews, which take place every five years. Mr Ian Byatt, the water industry regulator, said yesterday that 21 further companies had agreed the new licence provisions, making 31 in total. Until now, companies or the regulator have been able to seek changes in price limits on eight possible grounds of 'relevant changes in circumstance'. These are to be reduced to three for most companies. Canals board, Page 7</p>

			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Observer: Just the ticket The city of Washington DC, whose depleted coffers are just a little fuller today after the Israeli embassy forked out Dollars 63,000 in parking fines, has Senator Jesse Helms to thank. For it was the ultra right-winger from North Carolina who attached a rider to this year's US foreign aid bill docking the amount of unpaid fines, plus a 10 per cent penalty, from the assistance given to all recipients. Presumably the fact that Israel, the largest beneficiary of US aid, was the first to pay up was no mere coincidence. But, unfortunately for the impoverished city, it is not the worst parking fine offender by a long chalk. That accolade is reserved for the Russian embassy - even if much of its Dollars 3.8m bill was clocked up by Soviet diplomats in the old days. The Russians' excuse is that they are awaiting a new DC parking lot, given Moscow did the honours for the US embassy last year. Next in line comes the Nigerian embassy, which is incensed at its Dollars 77,830 bill. 'We do not park on fire hydrants,' Nigeria's press attache Mohammed Sani complains. 'The bulk of the tickets are for expired meters. We are not parked at places wrongly. There is just nowhere to park.' Obviously the same problem applies in London. In 1992 Nigerian diplomats boasted 167 unpaid parking tickets, making them the fourth worst offenders, after Turkey, Russia and France.</p>

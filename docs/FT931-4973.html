			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Solicitors to sue Mackay over fees THE LAW Society, the solicitors' governing body, is to sue Lord Mackay, the lord chancellor, over his plans to introduce standard fees for criminal legal aid work in the magistrates' courts. This is the second time the profession has taken a lord chancellor to court over legal aid. In 1986 the Bar and the Law Society sought a judicial review of a refusal by Lord Hailsham, then lord chancellor, to award legal aid lawyers a 'fair and reasonable' pay rise. The case was settled out of court. The decision to seek a judicial review of Lord Mackay's standard fee proposals follows a year-long campaign by solicitors to persuade Lord Mackay not to replace the current system of paying solicitors on the basis of the work actually done with a system based on standard fees for different categories of case. Lord Mackay intends to introduce the standard fees system from April 1. The society argues that standard fees will overpay some lawyers and underpay others. This could result in mistrust between client and solicitor and reduce the quality of the service available to those who need legal aid. Mr Mark Sheldon, president of the Law Society, said: 'This case is about ensuring that proper representation remains available to to those who need criminal legal aid. This is not a dispute in which we are seeking more pay for solicitors.' The society said it hoped its application for judicial review could be dealt with quickly and it urged Lord Mackay not to make the regulations to introduce the system until the matter had been resolved.</p>

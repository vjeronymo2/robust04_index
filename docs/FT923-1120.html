			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (6): Code saves time - Profile of Michell Bearings THE IMPORTANCE in modern manufacturing of computer-aided design and computer-numerically controlled machining is crucial, but the link between the two is often ignored, writes Andrew Baxter. Essentially, turning an intricate, multi-coloured Cad design into something that a CNC machine tool understands involves creating a file which can be converted into a machine control tape written in CNC code. The problem, however, has been generating CNC code swiftly and accurately enough without increasing programming resources excessively. This is a particular concern with small batch production, where 'one-offs' and 'two-offs' each require a new code. Over the past three years Newcastle-based Michell Bearings, part of the Vickers marine engineering division, has developed a solution. Michell is one of the world's leading producers of white metal bearings for marine and industrial applications - the white metal is a mainly tin-based metal lining that bears the brunt of the lubrication job. Like Hoover in vacuum cleaners, Michell has become virtually a generic term for the 'pivoting pad' bearing patented by A. G. M. Michell in 1905. Michell is particularly well-known for its thrust bearings used in arduous, heavy- duty applications such as submarines or hydro-electric power stations. Michell would still recognise the products of a company he founded in 1920, and the commitment to pushing the frontiers of technology, but the company's current manufacturing processes and culture would startle any early-20th century engineer. Over the past 10 years, many of Michell's old manual lathes and other machine tools have been replaced by multi-function CNC machining centres. The new machines can do the work of as many as six of their forbears, but the dramatic reductions in machining time caused an unexpected snag. With a large part of Michell's business devoted to small batches, the company found it could not generate CNC code fast enough. 'Three years ago we had 14 CNC machine tools, and for every one we saved four to eight operators,' says Mr Stuart Clifford, director and general manager. 'But it was costing us two programmers to support it.' The solution, developed by Mr Ray High, Michell's production engineering manager, has involved creating a database of the many possible geometric/mechanical features of a bearing, allowing a programmer to construct on screen the equivalent of a photofit picture. As the selection of the various slots, drill holes and chamfers is inputted, and adjustments included to suit the customer's requirements, two files are simultaneously created: one to create Cad drawings, the other a 'sequence file' to create a CNC code in the so-called macro format used by machine tools. The information is stored on disc, which is inserted into the machine tool's CNC unit. In theory, therefore, a customer could give design instructions to a programmer and then watch the component being machined on the shopfloor. Michell plans to move quickly over the next year to implement the system. Some 75-80 per cent of its products are capable of being produced this way, says Mr High. The potential benefits in time saved are important in an increasingly competitive bearings market. Michell's delivery times used to average 22-24 weeks - and even then it was occasionally late - but now it has to deliver in eight to 10 weeks. 'And these days you are not allowed to miss, so it's essential that the new system works,' says Mr Clifford. The stakes are high. Bearing producers are picking up more work from power equipment suppliers that traditionally made their own bearings, and Michell wants to continue its current progress, exploiting growth prospects in Japan, south-east Asia and Europe. Its sales have risen 71 per cent over five years to Pounds 12-13m, due partly to a sharp rise in exports from 30 per cent of sales to 79 per cent over 10 years. Implementation of the new process is in its early stages, but has already caused a stir. In May Michell's system was among the winners of the 1992 ECS Machinery awards for innovation sponsored by Machinery magazine and Engineering Computer Services. Even the Japanese manufacturers of the two Tsugami machining centres fully linked to the system visited Michell to see the effects of turning a machine tool into a 'factory within a factory.' The irrepressible Mr High, meanwhile, is not resting on his laurels, and is already working on even faster versions of his new system.</p>

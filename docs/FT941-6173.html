			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Mexico bows to Zapatista demands The Mexican government has agreed to meet many of the principal demands of the rebel Zapatista guerrillas in the state of Chiapas, preparing the way for a peaceful end to the peasant uprising that began on New Year's Day. 'The formula for peace has been defined,' Mr Manuel Camacho, the presidential envoy in Chiapas, said after 10 days' talks in San Cristobal de las Casas. 'The terms of the peace accords and of the end of hostilities in Chiapas have been made clear.' The government formally responded to a series of rebel demands in a 32-point accord, promising to boost housing, education, health, employment and local democracy in the impoverished state. The rebels will now return to their villages and consult with their supporters. If the rebels backed the government proposals, a formal peace agreement would be signed, Mr Camacho added. He stressed reconciliation in Chiapas would only be possible as peace accords were complied with. 'The work of building peace in the villages, farms and communities is going to be very difficult.' The government is on the point of concluding talks with national opposition parties to make electoral tribunals independent of the governing party. In this way it will be indirectly meeting rebel demands for national democratic changes not reached in the accord. An extraordinary session of Congress to approve such reforms will now be convened. The Zapatistas had seized San Cristobal de las Casas and other towns in Chiapas, in a revolt they said was prompted by poverty. The preliminary accord with the rebels helped the stock market recover from sharp falls early yesterday. The market closed at 2563, 1.9 per cent up on the day. But the agreement did not prevent further weakening in the exchange rate. The 24-hour peso/dollar exchange rate fell to 3.26 yesterday, down slightly on the day, against a rate of 3.10 prevailing for most of February. Analysts attributed the decline in the peso to the recent rise in US interest rates and the decrease in rates on Mexican government paper. Yesterday the steady fall in Mexican short-term interest rates was reversed, as rates on 28-day government paper rose 20 basis points to 9.01 per cent.</p>

			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Poland returns ex-communists to prominent role: Disillusion with market-led economic reforms revives fortunes of leftwing parties POLISH voters yesterday opted for a slowdown in the pace of market-led economic reforms by sweeping the disgraced former communists back into a prominent political role as the largest single party in the next parliament. First results reported early today by Polish television indicated that the Left Democratic Alliance (SLD) had increased its share of the vote from 12 per cent to 19.5 per cent since the last elections in October 1991. What may prove to be lengthy negotiations over a new coalition government are expected to start today. As the polls closed SLD leaders hinted that they would be prepared to enter a coalition only if the Democratic Union (UD), the mainstream party of the fragmented Solidarity movement, agreed to participate. They indicated that they would stay in opposition rather than join a coalition made up entirely of leftwing parties which would be politically vulnerable and unlikely to deliver any economic improvement in the short term. However, as the night drew on, the possibility of a leftwing government strengthened. The early returns suggested that the SLD and another party with its roots in the communist past, the Polish Peasants Party (PSL), might together hold nearly 300 seats in the 460-seat lower house. The PSL was in second place with 15.1 per cent of the vote after winning strong support from Poland's disgruntled rural voters. Mr Aleksander Kwasniewski, the SLD leader, said: 'We are elastic. We are ready for talks which should be quick and energetic.' The UD of Ms Hanna Suchocka, outgoing prime minister, was relegated to third place with 12.1 per cent. It was followed by the leftwing Union of Labour, another Solidarity-based party, had 6.6 per cent. The two main parties datingback to the communist era - the SLD and PSL  - managed to capitalise on the resentments of public-sector workers, pensioners and the 2.8m unemployed who feel they have failed to share in the new wealth created by the booming private sector. The expected results will send a discouraging message to market reformers in Russia, Ukraine and other former Soviet states struggling against conservative forces linked to the former Soviet system. They also send a warning signal to potential foreign investors and the foreign commercial banks that are seeking to impose tough conditions for the rescheduling of Poland's Dollars 12bn bank debt. Five smaller parties are hovering around the 5 per cent share of the national vote required for entry into the 460-seat lower house of parliament, the Sejm. The fate of the minor parties, whose presence in the new parliament would increase the capacity of the post-communist-era politicians to form a coalition that would leave the SLD in opposition, will become known when the votes are counted later this week. The small parties include the Non-party Movement for Reform supported by President Lech Walesa, the rightwing nationalist Confederation for an Independent Poland and the free-market Liberal Democratic Congress.

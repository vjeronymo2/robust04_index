			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / A-Z of Personal Finance (15): Safe but not what they used to be - National Savings NATIONAL SAVINGS and controversy are not likely partners, but after a year in which National Savings regularly made the headlines, it appears to be preparing to retreat to its less newsworthy corner. The controversy was a product of the government's determination to raise funds. In order to increase its contribution to government funding, NS launched a new product - the First Option Bond - last summer. The bond, which was aimed at basic-rate taxpayers, paid a fixed rate of 7.75 per cent net on amounts under Pounds 20,000 for one year. Building societies complained that they could not match the rate and alleged unfair competition. The offending bond has since been withdrawn, and NS has also finally lowered the rate of interest paid on its other products. Like other fixed-rate and deposit-based investments, this means that National Savings products are no longer as attractive as they used to be. But they cost nothing to buy and, short of revolution, are completely safe. Fixed-rate products With the exception of Capital Bonds, these are free of capital gains and income tax, and are therefore of most benefit to higher-rate taxpayers. The drawback is that they do not pay income and that they have to be held for exactly five years to get the rate of interest promised. If they are encashed any earlier, returns will be diminished. Those who forget to encash matured certificates will be put on to what is known as the general extension rate, currently paying 3.75 per cent tax free. Savings Certificates The bedrock of the range, the 40th issue NS certificates, pay 5.75 per cent compound per annum if held for five years. The index-linked certificates guarantee to pay 3.25 per cent above the rate of inflation, again if they are held for five years. An individual can hold a minimum of Pounds 100 of either certificate, and the most that can be held is Pounds 5,000 of each. An additional Pounds 10,000 of matured certificates can be reinvested in either or both certificates. If the holder of NS certificates dies, their heir can inherit the certificates without prejudicing their own holding. Yearly Plan This is a scheme designed to help those who want to buy a savings certificate through regular payments. Monthly payments of between Pounds 20-Pounds 400 are made by standing order for one year to buy a four-year Yearly Plan certificate. The maximum that can be put in over a year is therefore Pounds 4,800. If you can afford a lump sum of Pounds 4,800, you would be better off buying the certificates directly. At the end of the five-year term, the investor will receive 5.75 per cent compound, once again free of income and capital gains tax. Because payments are made piecemeal during the first year, the interest earned during the year is staggered. The Yearly Plan can be held alongside the savings certificates. Children's Bonus Bond Launched about 18 months ago, the bond is a way of investing money for children, perhaps as a gift for their 21st birthday when the bond matures. Rates of interest are fixed for five year terms. The present Issue E offers a fixed 7.85 per cent compound if held for the five-year term. After five years, another fixed-rate offer is made, and the bond will attract the new rate automatically unless it is encashed. This can be done at the fifth year anniversary, or when the holder is 21 years old. The bond will attract no interest if it is encashed in the first year and only 5 per cent in subsequent years. The maximum that can be put in the bond is Pounds 1,000. Capital Bonds Unlike the other guaranteed products, these are taxable, and tax has to be paid before the bonds mature. But since interest is paid gross, the bonds are primarily attractive to non-taxpayers. Series G pays 7.75 per cent gross when held for five years, equivalent to 5.8 per cent for a basic rate taxpayer. Higher-rate taxpayers will be better off buying the NS certificates. The minimum investment is Pounds 100 with a maximum holding of Pounds 100,000. Unlike the other products, the bond is automatically repaid on the fifth anniversary, so there is no risk of the holder being put on to the general extension rate. Variable-rate products Income Bonds: Particularly popular with non-taxpayers, because interest is automatically paid gross, the bonds pay regular monthly income. The current rate is 7 per cent gross equivalent to 5.25 per cent for a basic-rate taxpayer. Holdings are in multiples of Pounds 1,000, with the minimum holding at Pounds 2,000 and the maximum at Pounds 50,000. For couples who wish to hold the bond jointly, the maximum is Pounds 100,000. Interest is earned on a daily basis, and is paid as monthly interest on the 5th day of every month, once the saver has held the bond for six weeks. The first payment includes the interest due since the bond was taken out. Monthly income can be paid directly into a bank or building society. Investment Account: This is a one-month-notice account, currently paying 6.25 per cent gross, which compares favourably with instant-access building society accounts, particularly on lower amounts. The minimum for each deposit is Pounds 20 and the maximum that can be held in the account is Pounds 25,000. Interest is paid gross, but the account is taxable. Ordinary Account: The replacement for the Post Office Savings Account, this is advertised as an instant access account, but notice may need to be given if you wish to draw amounts over Pounds 100. The minimum deposit is Pounds 10 with a total maximum at Pounds 10,000. The account pays two rates of interest, depending on how long you leave the money untouched. The standard rate is 2.5 per cent gross, but if a minimum of Pounds 500 is left for a whole calendar year, it will earn the higher rate of 3.75 per cent gross. Premium bonds: Premium bonds pay monthly tax-free prizes, from Pounds 250,000 to Pounds 50. The minimum purchase is Pounds 100, to a maximum of Pounds 10,000. The return on the fund is 5 per cent per annum.</p>

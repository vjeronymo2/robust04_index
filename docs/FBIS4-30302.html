			<p>BFN     [Text] The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song received a  solidarity letter from Zhirinovsky, chairman of the Russian  Liberal Democratic Party, supporting our people's cause for  peace and peaceful reunification on the Korean peninsula.    The letter is as follows:    Pyongyang.    To DPRK President Comrade Kim Il-song:    Dear Comrade Kim Il-song, on behalf of the great Russian  people and the Russian Liberal Democratic Party, which was  chosen by the Russian people to speak for their interest, I send  you a solidarity letter.    The Russian people are facing the world imperialists'  pressure, which is being inflicted upon the fraternal DPRK, with  anger and indignation. We, who are Russians, regard that as a  sovereign state, the DPRK has a complete right to conduct  voluntary science and research work to safeguard its people's  welfare and interest.    I attentively studied your country's history and know very  well that just like Russia, Korea's patriotism was not to occupy  another country's territory, but to safeguard even an inch of  their land. Korea has never committed an aggressive war. The  chuche idea is a manifestation of the traditional Korean-style  patriotism.    Russians are well aware of the fact that the DPRK never  threatened another country and does not threaten another  country, but that as a sovereign state, it will not allow anyone  to attempt to yield the DPRK for its interest. Also, we do not  want other countries to force their intention on the DPRK.    History shows that when it came time for the DPRK to defeat  outside aggression, the Russian people sincerely helped the  DPRK. Currently, we are supporting your policy to peacefully  resolve the country's division. I think that the 10-point  program of great national unity for the fatherland's  reunification, which you put forth, is the most magnificent,  practical, and just road for the country's reunification.    In the name of the Russian people, I wish that the fraternal  Korean people can establish a national, peaceful, nonaligned,  and neutral reunified state in the form of a confederal system  as soon as possible.    [Signed] Zhirinovskiy    [Dated] 21 June 1994, Moscow</p>

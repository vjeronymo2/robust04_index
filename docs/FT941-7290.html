			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: No foul play over rent reviews for commercial properties Sir, Mr V A G Tregear (Letters, February 9) questions the 'sense and legality' of upwards-only rent review provisions in commercial leases. But he presents no evidence to support the emotive suggestions that such provisions have led to 'agony' for tenants. In its submission to the government's recent review of the commercial lease structure, the British Property Federation supplied detailed research on the effect upwards-only rent reviews (UORRs) have on the market. The principal conclusions of this research were: 1. For all but seven of the last 22 years, the retail prices index has been at a higher level than either net rental income or rentals value. 2. Rental values moved faster than retail prices in the early 1970s and late 1980s, but in each case only for a period of about three years. 3. Of new leases agreed on a conventional basis in each of the past 22 years, all but those let in 1989 and 1990 would have produced savings for the tenant compared with RPI-linked agreements. The average level of savings to the tenant would have been 24 per cent of the total rent bill. From this, we see nothing to support Mr Tregear's passionate cry of foul play. The government is expected to make an announcement on the conclusions of its review shortly. There is no case for intervention based on the suggested effects of UORRs or on principle. The market has demonstrated that it is able to respond to client needs: 20, 15 and 10-year commercial leases are now available, as are break clauses. The rental price of much commercial space has also responded to market pressure in tenants' favour. Over recent weeks, ministers have made much play of the government's deregulation initiative and, more particularly, the powers it needs to repeal legislation burdensome to business. The commercial property market has responded to the rapid change in clients' needs. It would be a particular irony if the government were now to ignore its own guiding principle of minimum intervention by distorting the market.

			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Land Agency [NLA] will start studying  "East Asia Energy-Information Highway Plan," designed to connect  Japan with East Asia region by placing pipelines. Investing  Japan's technological and financial power in the project, the  NLA aims to complete the project, which will establish a new  industrial and communications base in cooperation with other  Asian nations, around the year 2020. The NLA has worked out the  plan in line with the National Land Development Council's  recommendation that "it is necessary to work out a national land  development plan that covers the Asia-Pacific region." The NLA  plans to put the finishing touches on the project at a meeting  of a research panel which will be established in June, with aim  of incorporating the project in the next national land  development plan.    The project is to establish energy and power supply lines  and  optical-fiber information and communications lines by placing  huge pipelines between Japan and the East Asian region,  including Russia, South Korea, and China. According the plan,  the pipelines, starting in Siberia, will run through to Japan  via Sakhalin and will reach China via the Korean Peninsula. In  addition to these pipelines, the NLA plans to place transport  pipelines for raw materials.    With the establishment of pipelines, it will be easy for  Japan to obtain resources from Asian nations, and its supply of  energy and raw materials will also be stabilized. The project,  which includes the placement of high-speed, mass-storage  communications lines, will also help promote and improve the  international exchange of information.</p>

			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / This is Christmas, season of turnover: Lisa Wood joins in the seasonal rush at southern England's largest shopping centre The first telephone call from a customer to the Thurrock Lakeside Shopping Centre in Essex yesterday came at 3.15am. 'What time do you open?' asked an anxious male voice. Throughout the rest of yesterday caller after caller asked the same question of the 24-hour operations room in what is the largest shopping centre in the south of England. Mrs Muriel Taylor repeated with infinite patience: '10am until 6pm - No, I'm afraid Marks and Spencer is closed on a Sunday.' The centre, whose 52 metre glass dome rises over the countryside near Dagenham in east London, has been open for three previous Christmases. Lessons have been learned with each festive rush. Yesterday, the last Sunday before Christmas, everything looked neat as more than 30,000 cars disgorged their occupants. Mr Chris Fear, operations manager at Lakeside, developed by Capital &amp; Counties at a cost of Pounds 350m, said the Christmas operation had become more efficient every year. 'We really start to lay out our plans for Christmas in late January and early February, when managers produce assessments of how the previous Christmas period progressed and any opportunities we may have missed. 'We learn a lot. The second Christmas we had substantial traffic jams. So we built 3,000 car parking spaces, taking the total to 12,000, with a new control team. The centre has more car parking spaces than any town in Essex.' The centre employs about 200 maintenance, cleaning and security staff - the last monitoring more than 100 closed-circuit television. Mr Fear said no extra staff were taken on at Christmas. 'Floors need cleaning whether 10 feet or 100 feet have walked over them.' But the workload is much higher at this time of the year. Saturday night cleaning staff dispose of about 10 tonnes of waste - much of it the packing cases from Saturday's deliveries. In a normal week the centre generates about 20 tonnes. Mr Fear said: 'It's more people to look after, more rubbish to dispose of and more problems to deal with. But it's routine - the problem is trying to keep the standard of service.' Mr Fear spent much of yesterday patrolling the 1.3m sq ft of retail space where many of the crowds appeared to be spending a day by window shopping. Most of the shops opened at 10am yesterday but the centre opens at 7.30am and the management company encourages caterers to open early for early birds. The patisserie opened at 8.15am yesterday and had done more than Pounds 600 of business by 10am. Ms Tracey Horton-Reeve, the manager, said: 'It's hectic despite the extra staff we've taken on. But it's worth it. What we can make, particularly on a Saturday at this time of the year, may be the equivalent of a week's takings at the end of January.' She said consumer demand was not always predictable. 'Last year we did a lot of mince pies but we couldn't give them away. This year scones and sausage rolls are the favourites.'</p>

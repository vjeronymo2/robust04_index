			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / International Company News: Suzuki takes over joint venture SUZUKI Motor, the Japanese minicar and motorcycle producer, has taken control of Pak Suzuki Motor, its nine-year-old joint venture in Pakistan which runs the country's only car plant, by increasing its equity to 40 per cent from 25 per cent, Reuter reports from Islamabad. Mr Osamu Suzuki, president of Suzuki Motor, told a news conference his company had taken control of the venture with the aim of improving efficiency and exporting cars to the newly independent central Asian republics. Under an agreement signed on Saturday, Suzuki bought an additional 15 per cent of Pak Suzuki shares worth Y861m (Dollars 7m) from the state-run Pakistan Automobile Corp as part of the privatisation programme of Mr Nawaz Sharif, prime minister. The new management has agreed to increase production to 50,000 cars a year within two years, and to 100,000 in five years, from 25,000 now, said Mr Saeed Qadir, head of Pakistan's privatisation commission. Pak Suzuki will be Pakistan's first privatised company to have a foreign management. More than 50 state enterprises have already been privatised. Mr Suzuki said the company was now losing Rp600m (Dollars 24m) a year, which had eaten up earlier profits. He said he intended to 'improve everything' in Pak Suzuki to make it financially sound. Pak Suzuki was also interested in marketing its cars in the former Soviet republics of central Asia, Mr Suzuki said. 'If we achieve good results in Pakistan, we will export from Pakistan rather than open another plant in central Asia.' Toyota and Honda also plan to make cars in Pakistan.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [By Yasuhiro Goto] </F>   [Text] What should be done to make gasoline cheaper?  --Discussion surrounding the Designated Petroleum Products  Import Provisional Measures Law and gasoline price issues have  been the sole talk of the procurement side by the appearance of  "100 yen a liter" in Aichi Prefecture, where resale within the  industry is considered a procurement source. However, sound cost  reduction measures also are being refined in a more modest sense  by the industry. It is a reduction of distribution costs such as  by enlargening tank trucks. Then, it also appears that something  will come of substantial regulation relaxation.    A superlarge tank truck with a 24-kiloliter load capacity  was  seen for the first time in Japan at the Sakai oil refinery of  General Sekiyu on 2 June. It is no more than a test vehicle with  no General logo or anything on the body, but the appearance of a  24-kiloliter truck was epochal for the industry.    Previously, a 20-kiloliter capacity tank truck had been the  biggest in Japan, but up to a 30-kiloliter capacity has become  possible by the relaxation of Fire Services Act regulations  which took effect on 1 April. If there is 1.5 times the load  capacity, very simply speaking, the number of truck trips will  be two-thirds that of the present and it should become a big  weapon in lowering distribution costs.    However, a different regulation wall is standing in the way  even with this relaxation of regulations. That is the Road Law  provision which prescribes that "The weight per vehicle axle  must be less than 10 tons." A 20-kiloliter truck has a structure  with a total of three axles, one axle directly under the  driver's seat, and one axle each under the front part and the  back part of the tank. The total weight of the 20 kiloliters of  fuel and the vehicle body is less than 30 tons and it can clear  the provision of 10 tons per axle. In transporting over 20  kiloliters of fuel, however, somehow it must add one axle.  Normally, the axle in the back part of the tank is changed to  two axles. If that is done, the length of the vehicle will be  extended for the added axle portion and balance. Vehicle length  must be extended to a certain extent because of the need to  enlarge the tank, and the Road Law regulation restricts free  design.    The vehicle length of current 20-kiloliter trucks is 11.79  meters, but according to test design, a 24-kiloliter capacity  would be 14.70 meters, and a 26 kiloliter capacity would be  15.50 meters. Considering turning radius and Japanese road  conditions, it is said that 24 kiloliters is the maximum size  that can be realized. The limit of 30 kiloliters obtained in the  relaxation of regulations cannot be fully put to use.    Of course, the Road Law was determined considering strength  of bridges and elevated roads and wear on roads. However,  traveling with over 10 tons per axle is possible on many roads  in the Tokyo metropolitan area. The petroleum companies also  will not use superlarge trucks to deliver to all stations, and  they should be able to use them within the limits of being able  to make deliveries on roads where the strength is confirmed.    On the other hand, if a 30-kiloliter truck is achieve, not a  few stations will raise a cry. According to the Fire Services  Act, the largest storage tank that can be installed at a station  is 50 kiloliters for gasoline, and 80 kiloliters is considered  the limit for total light oil and kerosene. With the current  mainstream 14-kiloliter trucks or 20-kiloliter trucks, the tank  is finally filled with four or five delivery trips, but with the  30 kiloliter, the tank will be filled with less than three trips.    In other words, a station cannot accept a truck unless the  storage volume has decreased to about 60 percent and the  inventory level becomes unstable at stations where a large  amount is sold. That is because there is a fear that inventory  will run out if there is some confusion in the truck service and  deliveries are delayed. If the transport means is made large,  the receiving tank also needs to be made large.    Another big thing in truck delivery is the problem of  observing unloading. Under the present situation, a qualified  person at the station must personally observe it. Except for  stations with 24-hour operation, it is necessary for large  trucks to run around during the day. If a driver could unload by  himself, he could deliver late at night or early in the morning,  taking advantage of relief from traffic congestion and shortened  delivery time.    It is apt to be overlooked, but the greatest part in  petroleum sales cost is distribution cost. In reducing costs on  the procurement side such as import or transfer of business,  uncertain factors such as market prices follow in the shadows.  Thus, it is not strange that efforts to lower the price of  gasoline begin from reduction of distribution costs by sound  relaxation of regulations.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Health specialists encouraged organizations to work  together in the prevention of illnesses transmitted from animals  to human beings, which in medical terms is known as zoonosis.  During a national workshop in Ciego de Avila on the diseases  that animals can communicate to humans, there was unanimity of  opinion that this can not be a task of the Ministry of Public  Health alone, but of other institutions and the population in  general. A call was made to the Ministries of Sugar Industry,  Agriculture, Education, Fishing Industry, and Veterinary  Medicine to cooperate in that area.    Dr. Raul Cruz de la Paz, head of the national program for  control of diseases transmitted by animals, pointed out that it  is necessary to double preventative measures to prevent many of  these cases. It was advised that in May, the Pedro Couri  Institute of Tropical Medicine will begin experimentating with  the Cuban vaccine against leptospirosis in human beings.  Leptospirosis is the most dangerous disease transmitted by  animals in Cuba. In 1993, 1,446 people were affected by this  disease, of whom 75 died. The leptospirosis section of Ciego de  Avila was classified as the best in the country, in 1993, for  its complete and systematic work.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Basel, Switzerland, April 5 (AFP) -- The European  Monetary Institute (EMI) has found a building in Frankfurt,  Germany, for its headquarters, the Institute's Press Department  announced in Basel on Tuesday [5 April].    The EMI, the forerunner of the European Union's [EU] central  bank, has been theoretically headquartered in the German city  since January 1, but it had not found premises.    The announcement said the Institute would be moving into its  premises next November 1, in the Eurotower Building in the city  center, facing the Frankfurt Opera. It formerly belonged to BfG  bank.    EMI President Alexandre Lamfallusy of Belgium signed a lease  to the building on Tuesday. The Institute has been temporary  housed in Basel at the headquarters of the Bank for  International Settlements -- which Lamfalussy headed until last  January 1.    The Institute's status as the forerunner of a European  central bank and in preparation for the EU common currency was  laid down in the Community's Maastricht Treaty.</p>

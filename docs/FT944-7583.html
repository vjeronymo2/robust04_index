			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Getting the dirt on mucky past: The latest moves in the struggle to clean up contaminated land The government's forthcoming legislation on contaminated land will be the latest stage of a five-year struggle to get to grips with the legacy of Britain's industrial past. In 1990 the Commons environment committee published its first report on contaminated land, estimating that up to 100,000 sites could be described as contaminated. The government was quick to respond - too quick, according to its critics. Section 143 of the Environmental Protection Act, passed in November 1990, proposed that district councils maintain publicly available registers of contaminated sites. The idea, in line with the environment committee's proposals, aimed to assist local authorities and developers by identifying potential problems. But the proposal soon ran into difficulties as the government consulted local authorities and the property industry on what the register should include. It is costly to establish if a site is actually contaminated, so the government proposed that inclusion should be based on the historic uses of the land. The first consultation document suggested a list of 40 uses which could potentially cause contamination. Environmental groups applauded the proposals but landowners and property developers argued that the net had been cast too widely. There was clearly a risk that formerly industrialised areas would be blighted as developers chose to build on greenfield sites instead. The Merry Hill shopping centre, built on a former steelworks, was just one site in the heavily industrialised Black Country which would have been affected. The Department of the Environment's London headquarters, built on the site of a gas works, would also have appeared on the register. The number of uses that might cause contamination was later reduced to eight, which would have cut the area covered by 90 per cent. However there were other reasons why the proposals were seen as unworkable. One problem was that contaminated land would have stayed on the proposed register even after cleaning. The government's arguments for this were: that information on the site's history would be necessary when any future change of use was proposed; contamination from a site might have moved to adjacent sites; treatment rarely removed all contamination, while new hazards might be discovered later. More seriously, the proposals did not address the problems of clean-up targets and funding. Without targets or an idea of who should pay to meet them the register would not have solved the underlying problem. Mr Michael Howard, then environment secretary, announced in March last year that Section 143 would not be brought into force. But that was by no means the end of the problem. Numerous acts of parliament set out criminal and financial penalties for contamination. Property owners had no way of knowing the extent of potential liabilities. The question of liability was clarified by the Lords ruling last December in a battle between Cambridge Water and Eastern Counties Leather over liability for water pollution. The Lords ruled that Eastern Counties Leather, a leather treatment company, could not be held responsible for pollution caused years ago because it could not reasonably have foreseen the damage. In doing so, they rejected the application of strict liability of the kind which applies in the US - that polluters are liable regardless of whether they foresaw the damage or took steps to alleviate it. In March the government published a consultation paper, Paying For Our Past, with preliminary conclusions about the direction of future legislation. The paper included three principles: US-style strict liability would not be introduced. In line with the Cambridge Water ruling polluters should, in general, only be liable if they were at fault and could have anti-cipated the problem. Land need not be cleaned to a pristine state, only to the level necessary for its intended use. The proposal, which has been attacked by environmentalists, is an attempt to avoid some of the huge clean-up bills which have arisen in other countries. Although polluters should be primarily responsible for clean-up costs, banks should, in some circumstances, be held liable for cleaning pollution caused by companies to which they had made loans. This worried bankers, who argued that it would discourage lending to industry.  -----------------------------------------------------                    MAN-MADE WASTELANDS  ----------------------------------------------------- February 1990 - Environment select committee's                 first report on contaminated land  ----------------------------------------------------- November 1990 - Environmental Protection Act.

			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPECIAL SCREENINGS: TRIPLE FEATURE IN FRENCH SERIES  </P> <P> The French Revolution Bicentennial series, running at UCLA's Melnitz Hall, has  a truly strange and enjoyable triple feature today.  </P> <P> To begin at the bottom: Richard Pottier's 1951 "Caroline Cherie" is a naughty  travesty, but an interesting one. Based on the Cecil St. Laurent best seller,  and scripted by French playwright Jean Anouilh, it's another of those  heavy-breathing tales where a loose heroine in a tight bodice sleeps or flirts  her way all through a historical epoch, until true love rears its unlikely  head. As aristocrat teen-ager Caroline, Martine Carol -- whose reign as  France's premier blonde sex kitten preceded Brigitte Bardot's -- pouts and  slithers, strips to a chemise and rolls provocatively under the sheets, while  dastardly rebels and fat cads keep trying to seduce or guillotine her.  </P> <P> The 1949 "The Black Book" sounds formidable. Anthony Mann -- master of the  moody '40's gangster film before he turned to Westerns in the '50's --  reconceived the Terror as a gangland war, and shot it as a period film noir.  Aiding him were the nonpariel noir cinematographer John Alton ("T-Men," "Raw  Deal"), scenarist Phillip Yordan ("Johnny Guitar") and, in an amazing casting  coup, Richard Basehart as Robespierre ("Don't call me Max," he threatens,  memorably.)  </P> <P> In his day, Sacha Guitry's work was damned by cinema purists as stagy and  static. No film is more susceptible to that complaint than the 165-minute 1954  "Si Versailles m'etait Conte" ("Royal Affairs at Versailles"), shot almost  entirely at Versailles, with a huge all-star French cast as most of the  luminaries who, for several centuries, trod its halls: Jean Marais (Louis XV),  Jean-Louis Barrault (Francois Fenelon), Orson Welles (Benjamin Franklin),  Gerard Philippe (D'Artagnan), and Guitry himself, constantly seated or in a  wheelchair, as the older Louis XIV. (Even Bardot shows up, as a  lady-in-waiting.)  </P> <P> Later Guitry admirers, such as Alain Resnais, tend to dislike the historical  films; this version of "Versailles" is indeed constructed oddly. The Louis XV  and Louis XIV scenes are taken out of sequence and placed at the end, for no  sensible-looking reason. But there's still some fascination here. Guitry was a  legendary actor-playwright of the French stage, and a fantastically prolific  film maker as well. Even here, at 69, he retains his easy elegance. And, for  its views of Versailles, for the astonishing cast members (with their carefully  modulated, theatrically crisp readings), even for such weird moments as Edith  Piaf, as the Woman of the People, storming the Bastille with song, the movie  becomes a charming museum piece.  </P></p>

The session has been going on in the Cernin Palace in Prague  since Wednesday [2 March] ends today. The situation in the  former Yugoslavia was a key question of the session, Hoynck said.    Hoynck said it was emphasised that the only real way out was  a complex solution, and this could only be achieved through  close cooperation by the international community and the  recognition of the constructive role which could be played by  all its components. The CSCE could play a new role here,  especially in the sphere of human rights and freedoms and above  all by establishing ombudsmen appointed and supported by the  CSCE. Negotiations were also going on for the renewal of CSCE  missions in Kosovo, Sandzak and Vojvodina.    The participants of the session approved a decision to renew  the activity of the CSCE mission in Georgia, and to enable it to  monitor the peacekeeping forces in South Osetia and Georgia and  widen its mandate. They expressed themselves in favour of an  active role for this mission in stimulating dialogue between the  sides involved in the conflict by organising round-table talks.  They also favoured the arrangement of an international  conference under the aegis of the CSCE and with UN participation.    Hoynck also talked about the necessity for close cooperation  between the CSCE missions in South Osetia and Abkhazia. He  pointed in particular to the humanitarian aspect to the  problematic situation of this area, where thousands of refugees  needed help which could only be provided to them by the  international community.</p>

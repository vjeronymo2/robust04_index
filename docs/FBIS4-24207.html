			<p>BFN     [Text] There are serious rumors that the ANC and the NP  [National Party] intend to become one party at a later stage.    Perhaps it is only a section of the NP that thinks along  those lines, or a section of the ANC. Nonetheless, such a  development is still politically significant. It focuses  attention on the NP's total opportunism.    Firstly, the NP turned its back on the right wing, and then  adopted the old program of the United Party. But that was not  leftist enough. It then went on to hijack the political  platform of the Democratic Party, to a point where there was  virtually no difference between the NP and the DP. Through the  referendum, the NP completely swallowed up the DP. It would  then only be in keeping with the trend if the NP united with the  ANC. There are no differences in principles between the two  parties. The difference lies only in color. The ANC is a party  for blacks and Indians, while the NP is a white-led Colored  party.    There is another reason to lead one to suspect that there  could be something in the rumor. This is in keeping with plans  for the left-wing's "new South Africa," concocted since 1973 by  the ANC and the money powers. The primary objective had been  the destruction of the Afrikaner's political power. To succeed  in keeping it powerless, and to prevent any existence of an  opposition, the new structures have to be made as inclusive as  possible; not only the new multiracial state, but by implication  also its governing party.    The next logical step will then be to promote an NP/ANC  coalition, which will eventually lead to the country becoming a  one-party state.</p>

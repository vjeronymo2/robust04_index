			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Fall in value of arms trade THE WORLD arms trade in large conventional weapons dropped by 25 per cent in value last year to Dollars 22.114bn, according to the annual survey of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute published yesterday. The break-up of the Soviet Union was the main reason, Sipri argues. During the 1980s that country was responsible for around 40 per cent of the global trade, but that figure had shrunk to less than 20 per cent by last year. The value of Soviet weapons exports last year was roughly 22 per cent of that recorded in 1987, says Sipri. The US is now by far the largest exporter of large conventional weapons, accounting for 51 per cent of deliveries last year to a value of Dollars 11.195bn. The dissolving Soviet Union accounted for Dollars 3.93bn worth of arms exports. But Sipri reveals that Germany is now the third largest conventional arms supplier in the world with sales last year valued at Dollars 2.015bn - far more than China (Dollars 1.127bn), Britain (Dollars 999m) and France (Dollars 804m). Last year there was a marked reduction in arms imports to the developing world - Dollars 12.336bn from Dollars 16,720bn in 1990. However india was the largest arms importer (Dollars 2.009bn), followed by Israel (Dollars 1.676bn), Turkey (Dollars 1.559bn) and Afghanistan (Dollars 1.220bn). Thailand increased its arms imports substantially.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The leadership of federal Russia has called on the  two sides fighting in Yemen to immediately halt all military  operations. It said in a statement issued by the Foreign  Ministry that whatever the differences between the disputing  parties and whatever ends they had in mind could not constitute  a justification for bloodshed and fratricidal strife or the  suffering of the Yemeni people, nor justify the destruction of  what is new.</p>

			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / UK Company News: Resilient Spirax-Sarco ahead 2% SPIRAX-SARCO Engineering, the international steam engineering company, yesterday demonstrated the resilience of its international spread of markets by reporting profits up 2 per cent last year. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 22m to Pounds 22.5m on sales up 6.8 per cent at Pounds 158.3m (Pounds 148.2m). The 1990 figures have been restated to take into account the re-emergence of hyper-inflation in South America. Earnings per share rose 0.2p to 18p and the company surprised the market by increasing the final dividend to 6.3p (6p) to give a total for the year of 9p, up 3 per cent. Mr Chris Tappin, chairman, said the results were good in a demanding year when the group lived up to its reputation for consistent performance. Spirax had a particularly strong second half, partly due to the inclusion of Watson-Marlow, the peristaltic pump maker, which it acquired in 1990, and partly through cost savings. Sales in the steam speciality business, which accounts for 85 per cent of sales, were stable at last year's levels but the group increased margins. The South American businesses improved, with Argentina contributing a significantly increased profit. Interest charges doubled to Pounds 2.2m, following the Watson-Marlow acquisition. But debt was only marginally higher at the year-end at Pounds 17.4m after strong second-half cash flow and a lower dollar rate. Gearing fell from 28 to 25 per cent. COMMENT In an uncertain world there is something reassuringly predictable, like mother's cooking, about Spirax's performance. Behind this British engineering company is a stranglehold on a world market and a conservative approach that might have something to do with the Cheltenham air where the company is based. Thus, it has chosen to recognise higher sales and lower profits for its South American businesses because of a resurgence of hyper-inflation and it is playing down the significance of surprisingly strong recovery in the second half of last year. Like Weir Group, Spirax is also blessed with a highly visible profits stream, more than half of turnover coming from replacement sales for equipment already installed. The corollary is that once recovery sets in, Spirax may appear relatively unexciting. It remains, therefore, a stock for those cautious about the UK market and economic recovery and those uncertain that now is the time to be buying the cyclical recovery stocks. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 24m this year, giving earnings per share of 20p, give an undemanding prospective multiple of about 13.</p>

			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Major claims EU follows his lead Mr John Major claimed yesterday that other European Union governments had adopted Britain's agenda for economic recovery and were endorsing policies which many had regarded as 'unthinkable' a few years ago. In an uncompromising statement in the Commons, the prime minister told MPs that the government had endorsed Mr Jacques Delors' plans for higher growth and employment only because 'we took out the bits we rubbished.' What remained, he added, was the British prescription of firm control of public spending and inflation, open markets, decentralisation and de - regulation and flexibility in Labour markets. But Mr Major's account of the weekend summit of EU leaders drew scorn from opposition leaders. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, accused Mr Major of backing in Brussels policies to boost employment but of failing to deliver high-quality training and education in Britain. The Labour leader also attacked Mr Major's refusal - underlined again in the Commons exchanges - to agree to higher Community borrowing to finance major European transport projects. Mr Smith asked MPs: 'If projects make sense, what is so wrong about borrowing for genuine investment in vital infrastructure projects that will improve our economy, create jobs, stimulate growth and competitiveness and, in the medium term, put our public finances in proper order?' Mr Major said the EU had at last rejected 'outdated policies' involving extra burdens on business and borrowing. Stressing repeatedly the importance of a successful conclusion of the present GATT round of world trade negotiations, Mr Major said that Europe now agreed 'the only road to economic recovery is the one on which this government is already embarked'.</p>

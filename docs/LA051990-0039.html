			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A 17-year-old boy was sentenced Friday to 25 years to life for killing another  teen-ager in a drive-by shooting last year.  </P> <P> DeShawn Stallsworth, who was 16 when he shot and killed Armando Bracamontes,  16, in the head, was tried as an adult.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Jesus Rodriguez recommended that Stallsworth begin serving  his term with the California Youth Authority and be transferred to an adult  prison when he turns 25.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Gloria Michaels called the Aug. 8, 1989, murder on Wunderlin  Avenue "an incredible, senseless and stupid killing."  </P> <P> Michaels said Stallsworth had planned to rob a nearby house, but the occupants  weren't home. He then saw a group of young people nearby, who included  Bracamontes, staring at him.  </P> <P> "They just looked at the defendant wrong," said the prosecutor.  </P> <P> Stallsworth shot repeatedly into the crowd, also wounding David Sanchez, 21, in  the leg, said Michaels.  </P> <P> Another teen-ager with Stallsworth during the shooting went on trial in  February, but was acquitted by a jury.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOT, HIP &amp; HAPPENING: EX-FOOTHILL STUDENT 2ND IN CONTEST  </P> <P> Jennifer Anderson, a June graduate of Foothill High School in Santa Ana,  finished second in a nationwide poster contest sponsored by the Knights of  Pythias to enlighten young people about drug abuse.  </P> <P> Anderson, now a student at Golden West College, received $1,100 in bonds and a  $200 scholarship for her poster based on the contest's theme: "The Hazards of  Drug Abuse." Amber Goodwin of St. Clarksburg, W. Va., was selected the national  winner.  </P> <P> The Knights of Pythias is a fraternal order founded in Washington in 1864. Its  members support children's charities, a youth camp in the Sierra Nevadas and  the Children's Welfare Foundation.  </P> <P> Huge enrollment increases in California public schools will continue at least  until the end of this decade, the state Department of Finance has predicted.  </P> <P> New figures released last week by the department's population unit show that  enrollment in kindergarten through 12th grade will grow from almost 5 million  this fall to 6.8 million in the fall of 1999.  </P> <P> The increase this year over 1989 was 193,000 pupils, which is 10,000 more than  the department was projecting last May and almost 40,000 more than was  predicted a year ago.  </P> <P> These huge annual enrollment jumps are the underlying causes of problems such  as overcrowded classes, the shaky financial condition faced by 20 to 30 school  districts and a $5-billion backlog in unmet school construction needs.  </P> <P> The department's population experts said the enrollment increases are due to a  continuing rise in the state's birthrate, which has been climbing since 1974,  and to continued heavy increase of out-of-staters moving to California.  </P> <P> The highest projected percentage increase would be in Riverside County, where  school enrollments are expected to increase by almost 107% -- from 201,600 this  year to 417,100 in 1999.  </P> <P> San Bernardino County is expecting a 91% increase in the next 10 years, San  Diego County 55%, Santa Barbara County 49%, Orange County 44%, Los Angeles  County 36% and Ventura County 30%.  </P> <P> "History repeats itself. That's one of the things wrong with history." --  Clarence Darrow (1857-1938) From a Times Staff Writer  </P></p>

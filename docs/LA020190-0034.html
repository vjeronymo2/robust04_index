			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE BUTCHER: A LOT OF GOOD EATING IN VEAL BREAST  </P> <P> A letter from a reader recently suggested a new twist on an old subject that  sounded like something worth sharing -- veal breast. "For years," she writes,  "I have been buying breast of veal, cutting a pocket along the bone, stuffing  the pocket with any number of various stuffings, sewing it up and braising the  roast. Veal breast has provided a lot of good eating for our family.  </P> <P> "Recently, my market had veal breast at 99 cents a pound. They were huge -- at  least 24 or more inches long. I realized what I had been purchasing before were  pieces. This was such a good buy I bought the whole thing. Then I got home and  wondered what to do. So I did some 'cutting up in the kitchen.'  </P> <P> "I cut along the bone, removing the spare ribs with the skirt meat attached. I  wrapped them in plastic wrap and put them in the freezer. I stuffed and rolled  the boneless breast -- Italian-style with hazelnuts. It was marvelous.  </P> <P> "Weeks later after two days of thawing them in the refrigerator, I marinated  the ribs in a mixture of oil, wine, garlic, rosemary, parsley, salt and pepper.  My husband barbecued them and they were delicious. I've never heard of 'veal  spare ribs,' but that's what we had and they were superb. Do other people  barbecue veal ribs?"  </P> <P> You bet they do. Some of the best barbecue I've ever tasted was a Barbecue Veal  Breast created for a special tasting of wine and barbecue by Roland Hinni,  chef, at Benton's Steak &amp; Chop House at the Westin Crown Center in Kansas  City. I was there as one of the judges for the Royal National Barbecue Contest.  The purpose of the tasting was to show off a wide range of the best barbecue  tastes and then pair them with various wines. Hinni decided to depart from the  barbecue tradition and his barbecue veal breast was the result.  </P> <P> There are those (I am one of them) who would argue that it is not true barbecue  since it is not cooked long and slow over coals. I would classify it as a  "barbesauce" but it is delicious. It goes, I found, wonderfully well with  Fetzer's new light-fresh Red Zinfandel.  </P> <P> BARBECUE VEAL BREAST  </P> <P> 1 whole veal breast  </P> <P> 1 pound smoked bacon, chopped  </P> <P> 2 medium onions, chopped  </P> <P> 4 cloves garlic, minced  </P> <P> 3 stalks celery, finely chopped  </P> <P> 1 (6-ounce) can dark beer  </P> <P> 2 (8-ounce) cans tomato sauce  </P> <P> 1 cup catsup  </P> <P> 1/2 cup brown sugar, packed  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons prepared mustard  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> 1/2 cup oil  </P> <P> 3 green onions, finely chopped  </P> <P> Bone veal breast, leaving small amount of meat on bones.  </P> <P> Saute bacon in large saucepan. Add onions, garlic and celery. Cook until onions  are translucent, then drain off oil and grease and deglaze pan with beer. Add  tomato sauce, catsup, brown sugar, Worcestershire and prepared mustard. Cover  and simmer 30 minutes.  </P> <P> Season veal ribs on both sides with salt and pepper to taste and brown well in  hot oil on both sides. Cut veal into strips between ribs.  </P> <P> Place veal in heavy, covered casserole, pour over sauce and braise at 325  degrees 30 minutes. Sprinkle with chopped green onions before serving. Makes 6  servings.  </P> <P> Note: Reserve boneless meat for Italian-Style Rolled Veal With Hazelnuts.  </P> <P> ITALIAN-STYLE ROLLED VEAL WITH HAZELNUTS  </P> <P> 1 (2- to 3-pound) boneless veal breast  </P> <P> 3 cloves garlic, minced  </P> <P> Salt  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg  </P> <P> 1/4 pound prosciutto or cooked ham, thinly sliced  </P> <P> 1/3 cup shelled hazelnuts, chopped  </P> <P> 2 eggs  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons milk  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon butter  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon olive oil  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons brandy  </P> <P> 1/4 cup beef stock, about  </P> <P> Butterfly veal breast by cutting horizontally through meat, leaving 1/2-inch  thick uncut hinge along side so meat may be opened like book. Flatten opened  meat with pounder as thinly as possible (approximately 1/2-inch thick).  </P> <P> Spread minced garlic over meat and sprinkle with salt to taste and nutmeg.  Place ham slices over breast and sprinkle on hazelnuts.  </P> <P> Make thin omelet with eggs and milk and place on top of veal. Roll up breast,  jelly roll fashion and secure with string at about 1-inch intervals.  </P> <P> Heat butter and olive oil in heavy casserole over high heat and brown roll well  on all sides. Pour over brandy and cook until evaporated.  </P> <P> Reduce heat to medium-low, add 1/4 cup beef stock, cover and simmer about 2  hours, basting occasionally with pan juices. Add more stock if necessary.  </P> <P> When meat is cooked, transfer to carving board and allow to cool to room  temperature. When cool (not before or meat will fall apart), remove string and  carve in 1/2-inch thick slices. Arrange slices on heat-proof serving dish into  which pan juices have been poured. Reheat at 300 degrees. Makes 6 to 8  servings.  </P></p>

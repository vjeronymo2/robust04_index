			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The National Bank of Ukraine Tries </F> to Recover Its Stabilization Credit: It Will Be Interesting to  See What Comes of This"]    [Text]In February of this year, the National Bank of  Ukraine made a credit of approximately 10 trillion karbovantsi.  The credit was to play a stabilizing role (to be turned over  once for carrying out mutual settlements), and to be returned to  the National Bank of Ukraine by 27 February. In any case, this  is what Viktor Yushchenko planned...    Viktor Yushchenko said in February that the problem of  mutual  indebtedness among Ukrainian enterprises was having a paralyzing  effect on the economy in general. Thus, it was decided to put 10  trillion karbovantsi into circulation for stabilization. In the  plan of the National Bank of Ukraine's leadership, the credit  did not have any inflationary character; but it seems that  Yushchenko's fears that the money could be used for other  purposes have been been realized. The National Bank of Ukraine  has not made public the data on the movement of the money from  the stabilization credit, but during March and April the Bank  was constantly getting indications, the basic content of which  led to reminders that the credit had to be returned on time.    Among the actions which the National Bank conducted with  this  goal have been:    control over the deposit accounts of the debtors. The credit  provided by the Bank can (and must) be redeemed with funds which  the debtors have in another bank;    the establishment of priorities for the banks in carrying  out  settlements, in this order: settlements for energy, payment of  wages, execution of the instructions of state taxation  inspections concerning the assessment of payments not made on  time, and the financial sanctions for this.    The National Bank is now preparing changes in the order of  the formation of reserve requirements for commercial banks.</p>

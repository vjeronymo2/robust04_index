			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kiev, 25 Jan -- A letter, dated 24 January 1994,  from the president of Ukraine to Ukrainian deputies and Ivan  Plyushch, chairman of the Supreme Council of Ukraine, numbered  1-14/23 and concerning the Moscow statement, was distributed to  people's deputies of the Supreme Council of Ukraine. In  particular the letter says:    "In connection with the recommendation by the Supreme  Council  of Ukraine contained in point 11 of the resolution of the  Supreme Council of Ukraine of 18 November 1993, I am informing  the Supreme Council about the steps taken by myself and the  government of Ukraine. Talks in a bilateral and trilateral  format with the Russian Federation and the United States of  America were initiated by us to implement the Supreme Council  resolution. As a result of intense talks in Kiev, Washington,  and Moscow, a trilateral statement by the presidents of Ukraine,  the United States, and Russia was elaborated, which was signed  in Moscow on 14 January of this year. The text of the statement  and the appendix to it contain clauses going in the direction of  implementing the issues noted in the resolution. In particular  the accords reached in Moscow envisage granting Ukraine  guarantees of its national security after the START I Treaty  comes into force and Ukraine accedes to the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty. They contain pledges regarding  confirming independence, sovereignty, and existing borders and  refraining from threats of force or using force or measures of  economic pressure; a pledge by the United States to grant  Ukraine a minimum of $170 million for the dismantlement of  nuclear weapons with the possibility of the size of this  assistance being increased; moving all nuclear warheads in  Ukraine to Russia for their dismantlement with simultaneous  compensation being granted in the form of deliveries of fuel  assemblies to Ukraine for the needs of its nuclear power  engineering.    "In addition, and this is of especial political  significance,  it was confirmed that Ukraine, the United States, and Russia  will cooperate with each other as fully fledged and equal  partners and that relations between them should be developed on  the principles of respect for the independence, sovereignty, and  territorial integrity of every state.    "The United States also stated its readiness to render  assistance to Ukraine in creating a market economy in Ukraine.  In this way, the trilateral statement and the appendix to it,  and also their implementation, meet the demands set forth in the  resolution of the Supreme Council of 18 November 1993. In  connection with this, in accordance with an article of the  constitution of Ukraine, by way of a legislative initiative I am  submitting proposals to remove the reservations contained in the  resolution of the Supreme Council of 18 November 1993 concerning  article 5 of the Lisbon Protocol and Ukraine's accession to the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. A draft of a corresponding  resolution of the Supreme Council of Ukraine is appended."    Appended to the document is the Supreme Council's draft  resolution on this issue of the following contents:    "The Supreme Council's resolution on the implementation by  the Ukrainian president and the Ukrainian Government of  recommendations contained in Paragraph 11 of the Ukrainian  Supreme Council's resolution on the ratification of the Treaty  between the USSR and the U.S. on the Reduction and Limitation of  Strategic Nuclear Offensive Weapons, signed in Moscow on 31 July  1991, and the protocol to it, signed in Lisbon on behalf of  Ukraine on 23 May 1992;    "Taking account of the specific steps that were taken by the  Ukrainian president and government in the period from November  1993 to January 1994, in respect of the implementation of the  provisions of the Supreme Council's resolution of 18 November  1993;    "Proceeding from the results of the meeting between the  Ukrainian, U.S. and Russian Federation presidents in Moscow on  14 January 1994 and the trilateral statement and appendix to it,  signed by them;    "Taking account of the fact that it was confirmed to Ukraine  by the U.S. and Russian presidents that they were ready to  extend to Ukraine national security guarantees after the START I  treaty is brought into effect and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation  Treaty is acceded to by Ukraine as a nuclear-free state;    "As well as taking account of the obligations by the United  States, Russia, and Great Britain relating to Ukraine, to  respect its independence, sovereignty and existing borders,  refrain from the threat or use of force against its territorial  integrity or political independence, as well as refraining from  economic pressure, and taking account of their obligation not to  use any weapons against Ukraine;    "In view of the confirmation from the Ukrainian, American,  and Russian presidents that they will build their relations on  the basis of respect for the independence, sovereignty, and  territorial integrity of each of the states, as well as the  confirmation of their readiness to assist Ukraine in setting up  an effective market economy; and    "Acknowledging the fact that the United States assured  Ukraine of providing technical and financial assistance to  dismantle nuclear weapons securely and safely and preserve  fissionable material, as well as of promoting the speedy  implementation of the agreements on this assistance, that are  already in existence, the Supreme Council of Ukraine resolves:    "1. Taking into account the specific measures taken by the  president and Government of Ukraine regarding implementation of  the resolution of the Supreme Council of Ukraine on 18 November  1993 and the steps on the part of the United States and Russia  to meet Ukraine half way, to remove the reservations regarding  Article 5 of the Protocol to the START I Treaty signed in Lisbon  on 23 May 1992.    "2. To charge the Government of Ukraine to exchange  instruments of ratification of the START I Treaty.    "3. To accede to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty of 1  July 1968, which will henceforth be called the Treaty, as a  state not owning nuclear weapons, with the following statement:    "1) Ukraine owns the components of the nuclear weapons that  it inherited from the former USSR. After the weapons are  dismantled and destroyed under its control and in accordance  with a procedure that will rule out the possibility of reusing  these weapons' components for the original purpose, Ukraine  intends to use the material extracted from them exclusively for  civilian purposes, as fuel for Ukrainian AES [nuclear electric  power station]'s in particular, or receive compensation for them;    "2) The Treaty does not fully cover the unique situation  that  arose as a result of the disintegration of nuclear power of the  Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The presence of nuclear  weapons on the territory of Ukraine until they are eliminated  entirely, as well as appropriate activity to maintain, service,  and eliminate them, does not contravene Articles 1 and 2 of the  Treaty.    "3) Ukraine will hold talks with the International Atomic  Energy Agency with the aim of concluding agreements regarding  the guarantees envisaged by the Treaty;    "4) The violation of the territorial integrity or  inviolability of Ukraine's borders on the part of any nuclear  state will be viewed by Ukraine as a violation of the Treaty."</p>

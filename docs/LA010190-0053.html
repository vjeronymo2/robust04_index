			<p><P> January 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Ed Chynoweth, the president of the Western Hockey League, stepped in and  persuaded members of the Tri-Cities Americans that they should play their  scheduled game against the Portland Winter Hawks at Portland Sunday night.  </P> <P> The night before, the Americans and Winter Hawks were scheduled to play in in  Kennewick, Wash., but that game was canceled after 20 members of the Americans  refused to play.  </P> <P> The revolt was aimed at Bill LaForge, the team's new director of hockey  operations. The players want him fired.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the players said Saturday that they disliked LaForge's approach  and would not play until he is gone.  </P> <P> Chynoweth said a compromise was reached Sunday. He didn't say what it was, but  added: "What I pointed out to them, very simply, was that if they weren't  prepared to play, then I had no choice but to look at possible suspensions and  the possible loss of scholarships.  </P> <P> "I don't think that's a threat. I think that's a fact of life."  </P> <P> LaForge, hired Dec. 17, has taken on the duties of co-coach with Rick Kozuback,  who has been head coach since the hockey season began. The Americans began the  season as a favorite to win the WHL's Western Division but have fallen into  third place at 16-16-3.  </P></p>

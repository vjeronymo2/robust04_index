			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Second half of 1993 before 3i flotation The delayed flotation of 3i, Britain's largest venture capital group, is not now expected to take place until the second half of 1993 at the earliest, according to sources close to the company. 3i said yesterday: 'When we announced a further postponement of the flotation in June we undertook to make a further announcement before the end of the year. Since then we have not seen adequate signs of economic recovery and we have decided to defer to 1993 any decision as to a possible date. We will keep the matter under review.' 3i had originally planned a flotation, then expected to have a market capitalisation of up to Pounds 1.2bn, in early 1992.</p>

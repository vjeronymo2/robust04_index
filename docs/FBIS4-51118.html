			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 24 (AFP)--Beijing's security chief has  called for a strict public order crackdown in the capital, a  report said Tuesday, less than two weeks before the fifth  anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre.    Su Zhongxiang, director of the Beijing municipal Public  Security Bureau (PSB), called on all the capital's PSB organs to  strengthen the defence of social stability and deal swiftly  "with any problems that might emerge suddenly." Su, whose  remarks were carried on the front page of the Public Security  News [RENMIN GONGAN BAO], also stressed the importance of  preventative policing in clamping down on criminal activity.    Security has been noticeably stepped up in Beijing in the  past month amid heightened tension in the run up to the  anniversary of the June 4 suppression of the 1989 pro-democracy  movement. According to western military analysts, the number of  People's Armed Police in Beijing has been steadily built up  since 1989 and now totals some 100,000 officers who have been  given intensive anti-riot training.    A general law and order crackdown launched at the beginning  of the year has achieved "certain successes," the newspaper  said. "But, in order to guarantee social order, the Beijing PSB  has decided that all departments must take a stronger initiative  in suppressing criminal activity."    The Beijing police have uncovered 2,731 criminal cases since  January and broken up more than 400 criminal gangs, the  newspaper added.    Su's remarks follow a series of warnings by top government  and party officials on the issue of public order nationwide.  President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng both made recent  speeches -- given wide publicity in the Chinese media --  stressing the paramount importance of ensuring social stability  by all means necessary. Jiang even went so far as to defend the  military suppression of June 4, which he credited for laying the  foundation for China's current stability.</p>

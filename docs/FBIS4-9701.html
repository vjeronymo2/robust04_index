			<p>BFN     [Text] San Salvador, 30 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- The ruling  Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA) captured 49.05 percent  of the votes in the 20 March election, while the leftist  coalition, partly formed by former guerrillas, garnered 24.9  percent of the votes. Today, the Salvadoran Supreme Electoral  Tribunal (TSE) announced that as a result, a runoff election  will be held. The right-wing ARENA candidate, Armando Calderon  Sol, fell just short of an absolute majority (over 50 percent of  the votes). He will face Ruben Zamora, from the leftist  coalition, in a runoff on 24 April.    After 10 days of vote counting, the TSE has announced the  official election results and has scheduled runoff elections,  the date for which has already been agreed upon although it will  be officially announced in 72 hours. Electoral authorities have  not yet announced official results of legislative and municipal  elections, also held on 20 March, in which, according to the  provisional vote count, the two leading groups won percentages  similar to those in the presidential election.    Yesterday Calderon acknowledged he had not won an absolute  majority and announced his participation in the runoff. This  despite the fact that while the vote count was still proceeding  Calderon asked Zamora to withdraw from the runoff and concede  the election.    Zamora was nominated by former guerrillas of the Farabundo  Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) and by the social  democratic parties: Democratic Convergence (CD) and the National  Revolutionary Movement (MNR).    According to official presidential election results, ARENA  won 641,108 votes, which represent 49.05 percent; the leftist  coalition 325,582 (24.90 percent); and the Christian Democratic  Party (PDC) 214,277 votes (16.39 percent). The National  Conciliation Party (conservative) garnered 70,504 votes (5.39  percent); the Unity Movement (MU, evangelical), 31,502 votes  (2.41 percent); and the National Solidarity Movement (MSN,  evangelical) 13,841 votes (1.06 percent). The Authentic  Christian Movement (MAC, right-wing), which nominated a woman  for the presidency, Rhina Escalante de Rey Prendes, was unable  to attract the 1 percent needed to stay alive in the political  arena and thus will cease to exist as a political party. The  total number of votes cast in the presidential election was  1,411,320, of which 4,849 were challenged, 70,503 were annulled,  and 28,311 were blank.    Even though the TSE did not announce official figures for  abstentionism and even though the total number of eligible  voters (some 2.5 million) has not been provided due to census  problems, the provisional vote count placed abstention at around  45 percent.    Jaime Romero Ventura, a TSE magistrate, said that today,  political parties will be officially notified that a runoff will  be held so they can resort to any available legal mechanisms. He  added that according to the law, 72 hours must pass once results  are announced so any party can appeal before the TSE can  officially call a runoff in the presidential election. Romero  Ventura said Easter might delay the announcement until Tuesday,  the first working day after the holiday, when the TSE would  announce the results and call a runoff election between ARENA  and the leftist coalition.    The two political forces have already begun campaigning and  molding alliances with their sights set on 24 April, even though  the main potential source of additional votes, the PDC, has  announced it will not support either candidate. Of the smaller  organizations, the PCN, traditionally linked to the military,  has already expressed its support for ARENA, an organization  already favored to win the election.    The 20 March elections, witnessed by some 3,000  international  observers, were held without major incident. They were the first  elections in the country since the 1992 peace agreements between  the FMLN and the Alfredo Cristiani government, which ended 12  years of civil war.</p>

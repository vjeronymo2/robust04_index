			<p>Language: <F P=105>Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin to a visiting U.S. </F> delegation of the Hadassah women's movement "this evening;"  place not given--recorded in English with Arabic subtitles]    [Text] We made our decision, we signed the DOP  [Declaration of Principles]. We are in a process of  negotiations with the PLO, the Palestinians, about the  Gaza-Jericho First; first phase, to put it into a test, to see  what can be done.    But, in this agreement, we achieved the following:    One, during the period of the interim arrangements,  Jerusalem  remains united. We did not succeed to achieve it in Camp David.  [applause]    Second, to remain in all the settlements. And, believe me,  to my humble opinion, many of them have no justification  whatsoever. They don't contribute whatsoever to Israel's  security. Not all of them, a considerable number of them.  Today, the way that they were established creates a problem to  the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and the security forces to  protect the lives of the settlers, because they were not settled  in a way to protect the life of those who live there. Gush  Qatif, yes; many others, no.    I believe that in 1994 we'll see a year in which decisions  --  and major decisions -- will have to be made. It's a year which  I believe will serve as a crossroads in which direction  developments in the Middle East, especially in the context of  the Arab-Israeli conflict, will go: towards peace or towards  stalemate, and whatever stalemates have created in the past in  the region.</p>

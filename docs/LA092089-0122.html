			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR 2ND TIME IN 2 WEEKS VAN NUYS ELKS REJECT 2 BLACKS AS MEMBERS  </P> <P> Two black men who tried to join the Van Nuys Elks Lodge were rejected Tuesday  for the second time in two weeks -- a development likely to prompt more  protests against the fraternal organization's policies toward racial  minorities.  </P> <P> The lodge's rejection of Jules S. Bagneris III and Thomas J. Montgomery came at  a closed meeting that drew about 53 of the 370 members. Only 35 members voted  in last week's ballot.  </P> <P> Elks officials would not comment on Tuesday's vote, other than to say that the  two men could re-apply in six months.  </P> <P> But some members said Bagneris' and Montgomery's bids to join the organization  failed by a slim margin.  </P> <P> Bagneris and Montgomery were sponsored by state Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana),  a lodge member.  </P> <P> Rejected along with them Tuesday was Robbins aide Jack Sheffield, who is white.  </P> <P> "There was not a proper basis whatsoever" for the rejection, Robbins said. "I  am obviously disappointed. But if the majority of the membership were here,  they would not have condoned or participated in racism."  </P> <P> Robbins said he is considering transferring to the Lompoc Elks Lodge in Santa  Barbara County, which last week admitted two black members.  </P> <P> Other members of the Van Nuys lodge said they were embarrassed by Tuesday's  vote but planned to remain in the organization.  </P> <P> "I feel awkward, but I also have friends in the Elks," said John Pulskamp, a  member and former exalted ruler of the Van Nuys lodge. "The fact is everybody  in United States has at least one friend who discriminates against others for  racial reasons."  </P> <P> Dan Davis, acting exalted ruler, said the lodge should not be considered racist  because "the charities we support extend to everyone, regardless of who they  are or where they come from."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ran for Council  </P> <P> Bagneris, 29, is a Lake View Terrace resident and minister at an African  Methodist Episcopal Church in El Centro who ran unsuccessfully against Los  Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi in April. Montgomery, 67, is a World  War II veteran and a retired state Motor Vehicles Department examiner living in  Pacoima.  </P> <P> "I'm disappointed, but I'm not disheartened," Bagneris said. "African-Americans  historically have been despised and the struggle continues. This is 1989, there  is no way I could expect this to occur, even in the San Fernando Valley.  </P></p>

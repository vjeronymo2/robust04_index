			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Letter: Not a lot of paper in Brazil Sir, In his profile of Chris Patten (February 25), Philip Stephens inaccurately blames piles of research papers for extracting a 'sizeable chunk from the Brazilian rain forests'. This is a common misconception which has been widely adopted. In fact, the destruction of the Brazilian rain forests is in no way connected with the production of paper. Tropical hardwoods are unsuitable for paper-making. Wood pulp which is exported from Brazil comes primarily from eucalyptus plantations, carefully managed and grown specifically for pulp production.

			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Brown's support ebbs as Blair seeks backing from Labour left Support for Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, was ebbing rapidly among Labour MPs yesterday as Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, put out feelers to the left in his attempt to succeed Mr John Smith as party leader. Mr Blair was believed to be seeking the endorsement of Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, who is one of two potential leftwing candidates for the leadership. Mr Cook is picking up support from the small group of hard-left Labour MPs, but his backers among soft-left and Scottish MPs believe he would be well advised to reach an agreement with Mr Blair because he cannot win the leadership. If support for Mr Brown continues to fade, such a deal would open the way for a straight fight between Mr Blair and Mr John Prescott, the centre-left employment secretary. Friends of Mr Prescott said Mr Blair would 'definitely' face a contest for the leadership, even if all the other candidates withdrew. 'The party will demand an election,' one said. Some MPs said the leadership race would be simplified if Mrs Margaret Beckett, deputy leader, entered the contest. Mrs Beckett is not expected to run, but her candidacy - which would also create a deputy leadership vacancy  -would open the way for a virtually unstoppable right-left ticket teaming Mr Blair with Mr Cook. The rapid growth of support for Mr Blair may reduce the contest to two candidates shortly after campaigning begins following the funeral of Mr Smith in Edinburgh on Friday. Candidates for the leadership are avoiding public campaigning until after the funeral, in deference to the wishes of Mr Smith's family and the shadow cabinet. Mr Blair withdrew from a scheduled speech to a police audience, and Mr Brown cancelled a planned visit to south Wales. However, Mr David Blunkett, party chairman, said the party was already suffering from election 'hype' in spite of requests for 'the dignity that John Smith deserves'. He said Labour's national executive committee would probably decide next week to complete the election by the end of the third week in June. Mr Blunkett dismissed a call from Mr John Evans, the MP for St Helens and a member of Labour's organisation committee, for the election to be held at the party conference in September. 'For this to go on through August and September is not a happy prospect for the Labour party and ugly for Britain as a whole,' he said. Friends of Mr Brown said he believed many MPs would rally to his cause next week, but only one MP gave his public support yesterday and prominent members of his Scottish powerbase said they would back him with 'reluctance' if he insisted on entering the final stages. Mr Brown's camp also believes that he has greater backing among constituency and trade union activists than Mr Blair, but said he would not risk a battle for the centre-right vote if support for Mr Blair continued to harden.

			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow stages recovery after Friday's sell-off Wall Street US MARKETS yesterday regained some of the ground lost during last week's big sell-off, but trading was light because of the Columbus Day holiday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 37.83 at 3,174.41, almost recouping Friday's 39.45-point loss. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended firmer, up 4.77 at 407.43, while the Amex composite finished up 1.13 at 365.98 and the Nasdaq composite 3.32 higher at 573.84. Turnover on the NYSE was 126m shares. With banks and the bond markets closed for the day, trading was subdued. The rise in share prices was seen primarily as a reaction to the 120-point drop in the Dow over the preceding seven trading days. Although the underlying mood of the market remained gloomy, both about the economy and third quarter corporate earnings, some investors believed the recent losses created attractive buying opportunities. Investors were also cautious about trading ahead of this week's economic statistics. Retail sales and producer prices for September are due tomorrow, followed by consumer prices (Thursday) and industrial production (Friday), both also for September. There was little reaction from the markets to Sunday's presidential television debate. Political analysts judged that the none of the three contenders established a clear advantage during it, and consequently Governor Bill Clinton's lead in the polls would probably remain unchallenged. Among individual stocks, the motor sector was in strong form, buoyed by some positive comments from Mr Scott Merlis, the industry analyst at Morgan Stanley, about the outlook for the big three manufacturers in 1993. Ford climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 36 1/4 , General Motors added Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 30 3/4 , and Chrysler rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 22 7/8 , all in heavy trading. Advanced Micro rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 12 1/2 after analysts at two broking houses, Merrill Lynch and Gruntal &amp; Co, upgraded their ratings on the computer company's stock. IBM climbed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 78 5/8 as some investors bought in anticipation of a better-than-expected earnings report on Thursday. Maxus Energy rose Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 7 1/4 after Wall Street invest ment bank Kidder, Peabody agreed in an out-of-court settlement to pay the Texas-based energy group Dollars 165m to settle an insider trading lawsuit stemming from a 1983 takeover. General Electric, Kidder's parent company, was unaffected by the news, and was up Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 75 3/8 . Avalon jumped Dollars 1 to Dollars 3 5/8 and Zemex rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 5 1/2 after Dundee Bancorp proposed to acquire the former for Dollars 3.75 a share and the latter, in which Avlon holds almost 50 per cent, for Dollars 5.50 a share. Toronto was closed yesterday for Thanksgiving.</p>

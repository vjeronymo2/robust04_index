			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At 1600 yesterday a Turkish patrol boat attacked the  Greek fishing boat "Ayios Yeoryios" six miles off Samos. The  Turks pursued and fired shots to immobilize the boat just two  and a half miles from the island's shore. They later tried to  tow it to Turkey, but were unsuccessful because the Greek  freighter "Avandi," which sailed from Karlovasi Harbor, arrived  carrying port authority officials and soldiers.    The Turks were frightened, and abandoned their efforts.  Brothers Panayiotis and Mikhail Dhritsakis, each married with  three children, were aboard the fishing boat and in shock from  the attack. The Samos Port police boats pursued the Turks to  international waters.</p>

			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / It's a matter of doing the splits: Reshaping Japanese party politics THE Liberal Democratic Party has governed Japan for 38 years by hanging together while its opposition fragmented. During the 1960s the social change unleashed by Japan's rapid economic growth gave birth to minor opposition parties - the Democratic Socialist party and the Komeito (the Clean Government party) - which competed with the well established socialist and communist parties. Now the same process of fragmentation is affecting the ruling party. The current breakaway moves, notably the launching yesterday of the 44-strong Rejuvenation party by Mr Tsutomu Hata, are a far more serious threat to the LDP than the New Liberal Club, the only previous splinter group. It was set up in 1976 with just six members who returned to the LDP, tails between their legs, 10 years later. The LDP is very different from what it was in the 1970s, when it was governed by powerful patrons such as Mr Kakuei Tanaka who maintained party discipline. Now the LDP's leadership is weak and unpopular. The split in its ranks reflects deeper seated social change - the growth of a cosmopolitan, urban electorate which the old LDP finds difficult to represent. Yet there is little prospect of the Hata group becoming a leading party in its own right. It lacks the funds to become a large party. The LDP plans to borrow Y20bn (Pounds 125m) from banks for the election campaign. The Hata group's members are busy arranging second mortgages. Mr Kazuo Aichi, one of the group's leading members, said it would field only 60-70 candidates. He estimates 100 are needed to launch a major party. Many Hata group members are young politicians with weak local organisations thatcould be vulnerable to a concerted LDP attack. Nor will it be easy for the Hata group to get across a clear message amid the confusion of proliferating reform groups in and outside the LDP. The risk for the reformers is clear - the welter of new parties could simply split the opposition vote. The biggest loser in the election may not be the LDP but the socialists as their more independent supporters may prefer to vote for one of the new reformist parties. The rebels recognise the risks, according to Mr Aichi, but they are united by their determination to defeat the LDP and enact political reforms. For all their determination, the opposition parties will need three further developments to form a coalition to defeat the LDP. First, they need an electoral pact to limit competition between themselves and to maximise their joint chances of defeating the LDP. Second, to create a coalition government, splits may be required in the socialist ranks, to divide the hard-line leftists from the modernising centrists. A hard-line minority in the Social Democratic party, which opposes the Japanese security treaty with the US, would not accept a coalition with the Hata group, which includes vociferous supporters of US policy. Third, the LDP must fail to attract away potential components of the coalition. The LDP will respond to the challenge with a change of leadership and perhaps ideas on reform, although not before the election. The prospect of the socialists gaining power is likely to drive people back towards the LDP. An LDP-led coalition, perhaps with the Komeito, may become attractive to cautious voters who nevertheless want some change. It is widely expected that whichever group emerges in power after the July 18 election first will have to assemble a coalition and then introduce plans for political reform. Then another election probably would be called under the new rules. The main message of all this: Japanese politics will be unstable and unpredictable for weeks to come.</p>

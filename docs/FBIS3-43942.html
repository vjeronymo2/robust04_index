He was speaking at a Black Lawyers  Association function in Johannesburg.    He said the right wing posed a far more serious threat in  South Africa than the likes of (UNITA [National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola] leader) Jonas Savimbi posed in  Angola. "We are facing even more violence than that which is  raging now," Mr Mandela said. He said the ANC was not bothered  by the right's black surrogate forces, which he did not  identify. "But the ultra-right is powerful in the proper sense  of the word. They are trained and experienced and they know the  country better than we do. They are likely to create havoc," Mr  Mandela said.    To illustrate the right wing's destructive capacity, Mr  Mandela said the ANC's armed wing Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of  the Nation], in spite of its small size and inexperience, had  been able to strike at will.    He said the ANC had made it clear there was no question of  it  accepting a separate "volkstaat" [Afrikaner homeland] and that  it would be suicide for the ANC to accept an ethnic solution.    Rightist demands presented a challenge which black lawyers  would have to contribute to sorting out.    Earlier, Mr Mandela said constitutional democracy was  incompatible with continued white domination of the economy.  Paraphrasing former South African Prime Minister John Vorster,  Mr Mandela said the implications of continued white domination  were "too ghastly to contemplate".    At a second function on Thursday night, this time at  Investec  at which the company announced plans to help establish a  business school at the University of the North, Mr Mandela said  the exclusion of the black majority from mainstream economic  life was a major ANC concern. "Up until now black business  persons have been restricted to the role of taxi owners,  shebeeners, tuckshop owners and the like. Notwithstanding, they  have performed with remarkable aplomb. We can no longer be  content with that limited role," Mr Mandela said.</p>

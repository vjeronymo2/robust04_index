			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / UN aid routes to Bosnia-Hercegovina SARAJEVO Requiring food aid: 380,000. Being delivered: 78% Most of Sarajevo's food aid has got through in recent months, but the city is critically short of fuel: 85 per cent of the population depends on nautral gas, and the city's water pumps depend on electricity. SOUTHERN BOSNIA AND HERCEGOVINA Requiring food aid: 335,000; being delivered: 21% The situation here is criitical, aid agencies say, with fighting between Moslem and Croat forces blocking most deliveries. The Split warehouse has stockpiled food, but agencies warn of disaster in cities like Mostar if fighting continues. CENTRAL BOSNIA AND TUZLA Requiring food aid: 740,000; being delivered: 48% The Tuzla region is relatively stable, but there is strong concern about Tesanj and Maglaj, where up to 150,000 Moslems have been cut by Serb forces. Clashes between Moslem and Croat forces have also isolated many communities, with critical situations reported in Jablanica, Zenica, Vitez and Vares. EASTERN BOSNIA Requiring food aid: 336,000; being delivered: 69% A considerable proportion of the aid supplied from Belgrade is getting through. However, clashes between Moslem and Serb forces around the Moslem enclaves of Zepa, Goradze and Srebrenica have blocked some convoys, and all these towns are seriously overcrowded with refugees, with the water supply in Srebrenica reportedly serious. BANJA LUKA AND BIHAC Requiring food aid: 489,000; being delivered: 78% The situation is relatively stable, with most food aid supplied from Zagreb reacing the area. Concern remains, however, about continuing harrasment of the Moslem population in Serb-held Banja Luka and the presence of a large refugee population.</p>

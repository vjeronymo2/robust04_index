			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> METS' CARREON OUT FOR SEASON  </P> <P> New York Mets outfielder Mark Carreon tore a ligament in his right knee Monday  night and will be lost for the rest of the season, the preliminary medical  report said.  </P> <P> Carreon slipped when rounding third base in the eighth inning of the Mets' 3-1  loss to San Diego.  </P> <P> He was carried off the field on a stretcher with a torn anterior cruciate  ligament.  </P> <P> "Rounding and having to plant his foot, he just collapsed," New York Manager  Bud Harrelson said. "It didn't look good, and obviously he was in a lot of  pain."  </P> <P> Carreon entered the game with a .308 average over the previous 11 games, going  17 for 55. He went hitless in three at-bats before walking in the eighth.  </P> <P> Carreon is batting .250 in 82 games with 10 home runs and 26 RBIs.  </P> <P> Harrelson said the Mets will wait a day to decide on a replacement for Carreon.  </P></p>

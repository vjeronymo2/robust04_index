			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 23 (XINHUA) -- Russia today agreed  with the United States to shutdown its plutonium production, and  the U.S. side pledged 10 billion dollars investment in Russia's  oil and natural gas production.    These agreements were within the 22 documents on cooperation  in energy, space, environment, nuclear safety and other areas  between the two countries signed by U.S. Vice President Al Gore  and Russian visiting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.    The signing came at the end of a two-day meeting of a number  of U.S.-Russian committees established 14 months ago when  presidents of both countries met in Vancouver, Canada.    Before the ceremony, Chernomyrdin met briefly with U.S.  President Bill Clinton.    According to the accord, the U.S. will invest 10 billion  dollars in Russia's oil and natural gas production in Sakhalin  Island as well as widened environmental protection cooperation.    The accord on plutonium stipulates that both U.S. and Russia  stop operation of plutonium production reactors by the year  2000. Russia has three such reactors in operation, two still  producing weapons grade plutonium.    The joint committees meet twice a year alternatively in  Washington and Moscow. Gore will head a U.S. delegation to  Russia in the winter for the fourth meeting.</p>

			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOREIGN CARS' IMPACT ON TRADE  </P> <P> The editorial "Front Seat for Honda Accord" (Jan. 6) was apparently written by  someone who needs to explore the situation a bit deeper. True, the Accord is  assembled here, but its parts are almost 100% imported. The writer lavished  praise on the Japanese auto industry and scorn on our American counterpart for  its lack of initiative.  </P> <P> It's really unfortunate the U.S. auto industry has been under such heavy fire  (fueled by this and similar editorials) for so long that many American  consumers have become reluctant to give an excellent, quality product a fair  chance. Our U.S. auto manufacturers and workers have turned the corner in both  design and efficiency. We are now building and selling better than imported  domestic vehicles at competitive prices.  </P> <P> In reference to our efforts to bolster the U.S. auto industry, your writer  retreated to the standard right-wing line in deploring "protectionism" and  hailing "free trade." Free trade should be a quid pro quo. The Japanese have  effectively closed their market to U.S. exports and they'll never open it as  long as U.S. consumers trip all over themselves to buy their products without a  thought as to what Japan's restrictions are doing to the trade deficit and our  economy.  </P> <P> Another point the writer should have pondered is the fact that the root word of  "protectionism" is "protect." I, for one, see absolutely nothing wrong with  American business and labor lobbying for legislation to protect our jobs, our  economy and our way of life. Virtually every other industrial country in the  world has tariffs or import duties designed to protect its own industry, labor  and economy. We don't. If trade is to be truly free, it must be evenly  balanced.  </P> <P> All we ask is fairness in our trade with other nations. Instead of thumbing  your nose at the notion, you should insist on it.  </P> <P> AL YBARRA  </P> <P> President  </P> <P> United Aerospace Workers  </P> <P> Local 887, Anaheim  </P></p>

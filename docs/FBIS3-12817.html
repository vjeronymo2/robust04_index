			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with PLO Executive Committee member Sulayman </F> al-Najjab by Tawfiq 'Abid, "at his residence" on 5 March]    [Text] ['Abid] The Ibrahimi Mosque massacre has dealt a  severe blow to Palestinian action at this stage. Is it possible  to contain the effects of this massacre? How?    [Al-Najjab] The Ibrahimi Mosque massacre cannot be  contained. The same goes for the continuing massacre committed  by the Israeli Army all over our occupied territories. The  effects of what happened cannot be contained on the Palestinian,  Arab, Israeli, and international levels. Any attempt to bypass  the massacre, similar to what Israel and the United States are  trying to do, will result in the failure of the peace process.    There is a national Palestinian consensus on the need to  suspend the negotiations and to have a more serious stand toward  this far-reaching Israeli crime. The crime has raised again the  question of providing security and protection for the victimized  Palestinian people, and not for the Israeli settlers and Army,  who carried out this massacre.    This is not the first massacre the Israeli occupation  committed against our people that has elicited worldwide  condemnation and anger. The Israeli side, however, has  continued to get away with these massacres.    All sincere people should now work to prevent the repetition  of this bestial crime. This is very important. Another point  is that the impact of this massacre on the negotiating process,  as well as Israel's actual stand -- apart from sympathy --  should be assessed.    This massacre and subsequent developments have cast a heavy  shadow on the entire negotiating process. Regrettably, the U.S.  position, which has not stopped being hostile to our people  despite the end of the Cold War, is still keeping the Security  Council and the world community from taking the necessary steps  to prevent a repeat of this crime. The Security Council has  been holding deliberations for a second week without reaching a  serious resolution in this regard.    The Palestinian side and the other Arab brothers should  reflect on what happened and draw lessons about the true U.S.  position and how to deal with it as it is without embellishing  it.    We should consider that the European and Russian positions  are better than the U.S. position, which still insists on  imposing an Israeli solution on all Palestinians and Arabs and  which is playing a serious role in obstructing the progress of  negotiations.    On the Palestinian level, whether the negotiations continue  or not, the question of ensuring protection for the Palestinian  people and stopping the crimes committed against them must top  the agenda of the Palestinian leadership.    In the aftermath of the massacre, the Rabin government has  imposed a curfew and comprehensive siege against more than two  million Palestinians under occupation. The Israeli side has  also adopted other measures to fully isolate Jerusalem from the  rest of our occupied territory and to bolster its annexation to  Israel. In addition, the confiscation of territory and  expansion of settlements has not stopped. More than 10,000  Palestinians remain in the occupation prisons.    Moreover, thousands of deportees are still away from their  homeland. The question being asked by every Palestinian citizen  is: How can we believe Israel is serious about reaching a  settlement based on Resolution 242 when the first item of this  resolution stipulates Israel's withdrawal from all the  1967-occupied territories, including Jerusalem?    The isolation of the Palestinian negotiator from his people  will weaken him and weaken the front of negotiations if we  regard it as a new struggle and and a new front to end the  Israeli occupation.    The recent massacres have put the Oslo and Cairo agreements  to the test and shown the serious gaps in these accords,  particularly with regard to the question of settlements, which  is postponed until the final status negotiations.    The criminal acts practiced by settlers and the measures  taken by the Israeli Government to curb them are trivial and can  deceive nobody. I would like to ask: What will be the state of  Palestinian authority in Gaza and Jericho if one of the settlers  in Gaza, Jericho, or Hebron -- who is fully protected in  accordance with the Cairo accord -- commits a new crime? If we  are talking about a real withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, all  settlers must withdraw from these two areas. Regrettably, the  Cairo accord, which was signed by President 'Arafat alone,  thereby violating the Executive Committee's decision, has turned  the withdrawal from Gaza, stipulated by the Oslo Declaration,  into a redeployment of forces because it has given the Israeli  settlements -- under the pretext of maintaining their security  -- an area which is three times the actual areas of these  settlements. The Cairo accord also gave the Israeli Army the  right to control and move patrols on three roads in Gaza, which  have fragmented the strip into separate parts. The Israeli side  refuses to expand the Jericho area to more than 50 km under the  pretext that there should be no Israeli settlements in the area.    This situation simply calls for going back on what was  agreed  upon in Cairo and Oslo in this regard and for insisting on the  withdrawal of the settlements together with the Israeli forces  in these areas so that there will be no excuse to maintain the  Israeli Army in these positions.    Furthermore, the recent massacre and subsequent acts have  canceled any sense of security among the Palestinians,  particularly if the settlers, such as the gangs of settlers in  Hebron, are close to them. This requires the immediate  evacuation of these settlers-- a matter adopted by one-half of  the Israeli Cabinet.    The crime also exposed the serious mistake represented by  delaying the discussion of settlements to the final stage. This  mistake must be rectified before there can be any talk about  resuming the negotiations. We have paid a heavy price for the  Palestinian side's acceptance of the Israeli concept of peace  and the Israeli interpretation of the Declaration of Principles,  as was very evident in the Cairo accord.    ['Abid] Following the massacre, we have seen a split in the  Palestinian arena. Some people call for withdrawal from the  talks and others call for suspending these talks. Where do you  stand in this regard?    [Al-Najjab] First, we do not call for withdrawal from the  talks. The overwhelming majority of our people support the  talks that will lead to a political settlement on the basis of  Resolution 242. Suspending the talks is something else. That  takes place in any talks. And the suspension in itself is a  negotiating stand that shows that the party that adopts such a  stand adheres to its stand, seeks through pooling other  national, sisterly, and international forces to influence the  other party, and mobilizes world public opinion, including  Israeli public opinion, to stand against stands that are  undermining the peace process.    We must always remember that the Rabin government is held  responsible for obstructing the talks and eroding its  credibility in the Palestinian and Israeli streets. Putting the  issue of settlements on the top of the agenda receives unanimous  Palestinian and large-scale support. Therefore, we should  exploit this.    The large-scale criticism of the performance of the  Palestinian leadership with regard to exploiting this is correct  and legitimate. The hesitation and confusion in announcing the  suspension of talks -- even following the suspensions of these  talks by Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon in solidarity with our  people -- have weakened the credibility and seriousness of this  leadership in responding to a general national stand.    President 'Arafat was quick to accept U.S. President Bill  Clinton's invitation to move the negotiations to Washington,  without referring to the Executive Committee. By this he  contributed to giving the U.S. Administration credibility that  it does not deserve. He also gave the illusion that the reason  for what is happening is the geographic location of the  negotiations, which is not close to the White House in  Washington.    We saw how the United States used this acceptance at the  Security Council and we now see the current U.S. attempts to  prevent the council from adopting a resolution that meets the  requirements demonstrated by the recent massacre.    I would like to say here that the U.S. side is trying to  force us to pay the price for a formal condemnation of the  Ibrahimi Mosque massacre by excluding Jerusalem from the  occupied territories in the draft resolution.    Regrettably, some Palestinians have the illusion, the same  ones as the U.S. side, that delaying the negotiations for a few  days will calm the situation and that the negotiations could  then be resumed as if nothing happened.    This idea is an illusion because the bullets fired at the  faithful worshipers kneeling before God were at the same time  fired at the policy followed in the negotiations. The facts  raised by this crime are solid and cannot be overcome with the  passage of time.    As for the argument that says it is impossible to review the  agreements, this conclusion is totally wrong because the  agreements are not an objective in themselves. They are a means  to implement Resolution 242 and all its articles, to secure the  Israeli withdrawal from our occupied land, to guarantee our  right to self-determination, and to attain peace and security  for all parties in the region.    These agreement proved that they are incapable of securing  all these demands, therefore, they should be revised in a manner  that serve their purpose. We should consider the meaning of  Rabin's insistence on these agreements, and on the Cairo  agreement in particular, in refusing to reconsider the subject  of settlements and the timing of discussing this subject.    Backing off from unjust and dangerous agreements will not  undermine the credibility of the Palestinian leadership, but not  considering the dangers contained in these agreements and the  possibility that they may lead to more Israeli massacres and  entrenchment of occupation will.    ['Abid] Some people hold 'Arafat responsible for the  massacre, and say that the massacre was the result of the  agreements he signed with the Israelis, especially the Cairo  agreement. Do you share this view?    [Al-Najjab] I do not believe that a Palestinian or an Arab  could say such a thing. How can the victim be responsible for  the crime? I can say that the Israeli Government--not 'Arafat  as some went too far in saying--is responsible for the crime.  We should not make mistakes about this and we should continue  to work to let the criminal pay for his crime. The one who  occupies our land is the Israeli Army, and it is the Israeli  Government that builds settlements, arms settlers, and remains  silent toward their recklessness and crimes. In this, the  Israeli labor and Likud governments are equals.    ['Abid] Some Palestinians have urged 'Arafat to resign,  saying he does not represent the Palestinian people any more.  Do you share this opinion?    [Al-Najjab] First of all, and in this particular situation,  fights and demands should be focused on the perpetrators of the  crime. We should distinguish between the measures that should  be taken to force the perpetrators of the crime to pay for what  they did, and the internal Palestinian demands, or what we call  reorganizing the Palestinian house in a manner that develops the  performance of the leadership and the Palestinian establishments  and restores people's confidence in the PLO.    What should be toppled is the current policy, which has been  proven untenable by all the challenges and tasks of the new  stage of our national struggle. There are very strong and wide  criticism of President 'Arafat's policy. It is up to him now,  and he has to decide whether to continue this policy, thus  leading to more isolation, or to rise to a new situation.    If this is how I see things, this is because we are talking  about an issue of concern to the entire Palestinian community.  We are talking about the protection of Palestinian rights and  gains. All the national forces, figures, and institutions must  join hands to secure international protection for the  Palestinian people and to tackle serious problems caused by  Israel's arrogance and the open U.S. support it enjoys, as well  as the sorry state of Arab solidarity and coordination.  Additionally, the performance of the Palestinian leadership  leaves much to be desired and the legitimate Palestinian  institutions, including the PLO's Executive Committee, have been  in a state of inertia. Nor has there been a commitment to the  PLO's plan of action or the peace initiative.    ['Abid] 'Arafat is said to be very much in control of the  Executive Committee. Why is it that some members are boycotting  its sessions most of the time?    [Al-Najjab] I would first like to draw a line between two  groups within the PLO, although they have much in common. There  is the group of six who tendered their resignation from the  Executive Committee. Their resignations, however, are not  valid, since it is up to the Palestine National Council to  accept or reject them. Another group is supportive of the  negotiations.    As for me, I made my boycott of the Executive Committee's  sessions known twice. The first time was when 'Arafat  unilaterally signed the Cairo agreement, thus presenting the  committee with an fait accompli. I and others did not show up  for that session and, therefore, it lacked a quorum. The second  was when 'Arafat unilaterally accepted President Clinton's  invitation for the talks to continue in Washington. 'Arafat  thus turned a deaf ear to the voice of local and dispora  Palestinians, all of whom want the negotiations to be suspended  until international protection is secured. Hence, the call for  an Executive Committee meeting so that 'Arafat may explain a  decision he made on his own.    Only seven members turned up for that session. Five members  did not attend in order to deprive the session of a quorum.    It is not too late yet for the Executive Committee to  reconvene, according to rules. To facilitate this, 'Arafat  should break off the negotiations and go along with the  Palestinian consensus. That would open the door for a serious  assessment of the negotiating process and, having drawn the  necessary lessons, put it back on track. Such a development  would also arrest the deterioration in the Palestinian position  as happened when the Palestine Central Council endorsed the Oslo  accord by a majority, if with certain qualifications.    We have asked the brothers who resigned from the Executive  Committee to attend at least one session at which it may be  possible to take a vote on and abrogate the Cairo accord.    ['Abid] 'Arafat is said to have files on each and every  member of the Executive Committee so that he can win over  whoever he needs to whenever he wants to. Is this true?    [Al-Najjab] I have been asked this question often enough by  journalists. Regrettably, the cake has been carved up so as to  reflect the closeness of this or that PLO member to 'Arafat.    As an old political party [reference to the Palestinian  People's Party], whose participation in the Executive Committee  is fairly recent, we can claim to have nothing to do with such  tactics. How close we are to 'Arafat or other PLO Executive  Committee members depends on how much or little we have in  common.    We support serious and persistent efforts to defend our  people's rights and promote coordination and cooperation with  fraternal countries. We participate in a serious mechanism to  achieve all this. As is known, we participated in the  Washington talks, but we suspended our participation in the  ninth session for well-known political reasons in protest  against the course of the negotiations and the performance that  unfortunately still prevails.    ['Abid] But one of your party central committee members  still  participates in the Taba negotiations?    [Al-Najjab] Hasan 'Asfur was elected as the People's Party  Central Committee member at the second party congress. As was  announced at the time in the statement and by 'Asfur himself,  his participation in the negotiations was a personal decision  and he represents no one. It is known that his case was  referred to a party commission to have him account for not  abiding by his party's decision not to participate in the Taba  negotiations.    The fate of 'Asfur, whether he remains a Central Committee  member or not, will be decided by the party congress. We are  making arrangements to hold this congress. We are a democratic  party, and will respect the decisions of the congress, which is  the highest authority in the party. As yet, the violations  Hasan 'Asfur has committed are organizational and not political  violations.    ['Abid] Many voices are being raised calling for revenge  against the Israelis following the Hebron Mosque massacre. What  do you have to say to this?    [Al-Najjab] If we want to really avenge all the victims of  the Palestinian people, we must pursue work to seek salvation  from the occupation and to wrest our people's national rights.  I do not support any personal reaction and I am against  attacking Israeli civilians. Our cause is just and the weapon  we use should remain clean. It is impermissible to give the  Israelis any justification to cover up for their crimes or to  give those who defend them in Washington the excuse to speak  about terrorism without specifying the party they mean.    We must take into consideration the need not to lose the  Israeli voices that condemn the settlers massacres and call for  their removal by not carrying out individual operations against  civilians.    ['Abid] What is required on the Palestinian level at the  present stage? How can one develop some of the stands that were  shaken by the Hebron Mosque massacre?    [Al-Najjab] Our battle is a protracted one. What is  important now is to enhance our national unity, as well as Arab  coordination and cooperation, particularly with Jordan, Syria,  and Lebanon. We wish success to the efforts under way to  restore coordination among the parties participating in the  negotiations, especially since all the parties abide by the  comprehensive solution, which means the implementation of all  the provisions of UN Security Council resolution 242 on all the  tracks.    We must also pursue work with all of the international  parties angered by the recent crime to have them continue and  develop their support for our people and rights, taking into  consideration that these parties are getting more and more  convinced that peace cannot be achieved at the expense of these  rights, or by ignoring them.</p>

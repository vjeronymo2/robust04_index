			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Jean-Claude Martino, spokesman for President  Aristide, announced on 4 January that the 15 January conference  would essentially turn on the question of refugees. The  political crisis talks also will tackle the problem of a massive  exodus of Haitians. It is difficult today to prevent desperate  Haitians from going aboard on flimsy boats in order to reach the  coasts of Florida.    President Jean-Bertrand Aristide demands the departure of  the  military officials before the designation of a new prime  minister, his new spokesman Jean-Claude Martino said. During a  statement in Creole on the Voice of America, Martino recalled  the obstacles faced by the government of resigning Prime  Minister Robert Malval, a government which could not function.  As long as those obstacles are not removed, you can appoint  another thousand governments; they will not be able to function,  because those who prevent them (?form) an illegal government of  dictatorship that fears neither God nor man and that has no  other program than to kill Haitians and to make money, Martino  said.    Several Haitian parties, including the National Congress of  Democratic Movements, which is one of the two rival branches of  Haitian socialism and which favors Father Aristide, have  demanded recently the quick appointment of a new prime minister  by Mr. Aristide so as to get the country out of the crisis.  [passage omitted]    The U.S. State Department has let it be understood that the  question of governing the country will have to be resolved  before tackling the refugee problem. The State Department has  coldly reacted to the idea of a conference on the problem of  refugees on 15 January.</p>

			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JERRY LEE LEWIS IS AN AMERICAN ORIGINAL, A ROCK 'N' ROLL WONDER. HE'S ALSO  RIGHT OUT OF A FAULKNER NOVEL.;  </P> <P> ORNERINESS &amp; DEMENTIA  </P> <P> So you saw "Great Balls of Fire" when it came out last year. Frisky fellow,  that Jerry Lee Lewis. Apple-cheeked and yellow haired, full of those boyish  high spirits. Practically a puppy dog.  </P> <P> Yes, Hollywood took a good, long look at Jerry Lee, and it blinked. Flipper  bears a closer resemblance to Moby Dick than Dennis Quaid's screen  interpretation bore to the real Jerry Lee.  </P> <P> My own face-to-face brush with the Killer came three years ago in a stadium  dressing room. I was a complete stranger being introduced to him for the first  time. And I happened to have a set of binoculars dangling from a strap around  my neck. The first thing Lewis said when we were introduced wasn't "How do you  do?" It was: "How would you like it if I took those binoculars and rammed them  right back through your eyeballs?"  </P> <P> I allowed, as calmly and pleasantly as I could, that I probably wouldn't care  for it very much. This, after all, was the man who once shot his own bass  player in the stomach, who turned up outside Graceland waving a gun and  hollering for Elvis Presley to come out, who -- well, the stories are endless.  Jerry Lee Lewis is a character more worthy of a Faulkner novel than Hollywood  entertainment, a force of warped nature and ever-surging ego who is liable to  do or say anything. He is also a rock 'n' roll wonder, an American original  whose combination of orneriness and dementia have kept him burning through the  most haphazard career imaginable.  </P> <P> The Ferriday, La., native took off like a meteor in 1957 and '58 with his  piano-pounding Sun Records hits, "Whole Lot of Shakin' Going On," "Great Balls  of Fire" and "Breathless." Then a scornful world found out about his marriage  to his 13-year-old cousin, and the meteor crashed. Ever dogged, Lewis rocked on  out of the limelight until 1968, when he was embraced by country music fans,  racking up a series of hits that brought him into the '80s.  </P> <P> Not even a couple of near-fatal illnesses that led to the extraction of a fair  section of his innards has stopped Lewis' drive. Last year he re-recorded his  oldies for the "Great Balls of Fire" soundtrack. Now, at 55, he's back with two  cuts on an album of music from the "Dick Tracy" film.  </P> <P> My encounter with Jerry Lee ended with a handshake, rather than a pair of black  eyes. He saved his aggression that day for the place where he hones it into  spontaneous outbursts of primal rock -- at the keyboard of his blazing 88.  </P> <P> Who: Jerry Lee Lewis.  </P> <P> When: Saturday and Sunday at 7 and 9 p.m.  </P> <P> Where: Calico Square at Knott's Berry Farm, 8039 Beach Blvd., Buena Park.  </P> <P> Whereabouts: Take the Beach Boulevard exit from the San Diego Freeway and go  north, or from the Riverside Freeway and go south.  </P> <P> Wherewithal: $21 ($12 after 6 p.m.) admits you to all park attractions.  </P> <P> Where to call: (714) 220-5200.  </P></p>

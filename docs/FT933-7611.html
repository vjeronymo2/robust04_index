			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Arts: Reich's 'The Cave' reaches London In quick time The Cave has proceeded from Vienna (premiere in May) via Berlin and Amsterdam to a six-day stint at the London South Bank centre. Paris, Brussels and New York are set to follow. The music-theatre-cum-documentary epic by Steve Reich (music) and Beryl Korot (video images) is receiving a high-class launching. Reich's status, and the fact that this is the latest, largest and most ambitious of his multi-medium compositions, would seem to demand no less. As Andrew Clements reported on this page in July, after the Amsterdam Festival showing, The Cave is a three-part, three-hour melange in which excerpted interviews are interleaved with visual images and musical episodes inspired by the presence and the actual words of the interviewees. The purpose is to contrast Jewish, Arab and American attitudes to a crucial piece of Holy Land religious history - the relationship of Abraham, Sarah, Hagar, Ishmael and Isaac - in a way to pinpoint conflicts, dilemmas and misunderstandings both ancient and modern. Act 1 is the Israeli act, Act 2 the Palestinian; in Act 3, which focuses on the much more detached responses of Americans, threads of summing-up are drawn together. As witnessed at the opening Festival Hall performance on Wednesday, the installation gleams and glitters impressively - a large metal set-up enclosing five video screens amid walkways and stations for singers and players, a structure simultaneously practical and poetic. The package is expertly glossy, the presentation faultlessly crisp and confident. The technological aspects of the three-part unfolding, the linkage of 'live' musical sounds and statements and screened pictorial and verbal information, are achieved with considerable dexterity. For a while the fascination with 'how do they do it?' keeps concentration from flagging. Thereafter nothing can disguise the banality of the experience, the fidgety, flattened-out, repetitious quality of juxtaposed statement and counter-statement, the stupefyingly predictable patterns of Korot's image-creating devices. Amplification of all the sounds crushes the dynamic range to a uniform loudness, restricting the expressive range of the 'live' musicians in wearying parallel. In interview Reich has made much of the way his musical lines pick up and underscore the inflections of all the speakers, essaying comparisons with Janacek's celebrated method of creating musical cells out of 'speech rhythms' that in no way work to his advantage. The systemic patterns of Reich's musical lines, which could well bear repetition on their own, become nightmarishly tedious when linked to words far less capable of supporting similar repetition. Quite soon into Act 1, as a phrase such as 'Almost a pale figure' issued from the speakers for what seemed the millionth time, I wanted to scream 'Yes, yes, we get the point, now for heaven's sake get a move on]'. In sum, I though this a project boldly imagined but, in terms of basic material, numbingly dull, insubstantial and longwinded in the execution. If, as has already been loudly proclaimed, this is 'serious art for the MTV generation' and 'a glimpse of what opera might be like in the 21st century', then all I can say (with Samuel Goldwyn) is: include me out.

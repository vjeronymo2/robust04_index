			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WALTER DURANTY: REPORTER IN MOSCOW COULD HAVE OPENED THE WORLD'S EYES;  </P> <P> BOOK MARK: DRIVEN BY AMBITION, CORRESPONDENT WALTER DURANTY REPORTED HISTORY IN  THE MAKING FROM THE SOVIET UNION FOR ALMOST 20 YEARS. BUT, SAYS AUTHOR S.J.  TAYLOR, DURANTY'S AMBITION LET HIM BE SEDUCED BY PROXIMITY TO POWER, AND HE  HELPED COVER UP SOME OF HISTORY'S BIGGEST LIES AS WELL. AN EXCERPT.  </P> <P> In 1933, the watershed year, when Stalin finally achieved U.S. recognition,  rumors had begun to surface about a famine in the grain-growing districts of  the Ukraine, the Northern Caucasus and across the nomadic cattle country of  Kazakhstan: a calamity of incalculable dimensions.  </P> <P> For later generations, as the magnitude of that event emerged, questions would  arise as to why the American public hadn't been told. How did Stalin manage to  conceal the greatest man-made disaster in modern history, when perhaps as many  as 10 million men, women, and children were allowed to die by slow starvation  as a result of their refusal to conform to Stalin's plan to collectivize  agriculture?  </P> <P> Had this been a deliberate act of genocide or, as Walter Duranty (of the New  York Times) characterized it, an example of anti-communist propaganda  promulgated in "an eleventh-hour attempt to avert American recognition by  picturing the Soviet Union as a land of ruin and despair"? . . .  </P> <P> In mid-November 1932, Duranty paid a visit to William Strang, counselor at the  British Embassy in Moscow. By this time, the British Foreign Office was  formulating a general assessment of Duranty's character that was less than  flattering. Duranty was described as "a somewhat shady individual, who has been  accused (though not on convincing evidence, as far as I can tell) of being in  the pay of the Soviet Government . . . " It was felt to be out of the question,  however, that any of Duranty's opinions favoring the regime sprang "from  genuine conviction," as was the case with other correspondents who held  pro-Soviet views.  </P> <P> On this occasion, Duranty attributed what he called "the present breakdown in  agriculture" to the shortage of labor and of draft power. The peasants'  slaughter of livestock in 1930 and its continuation "by fits and starts" since  then, plus a serious shortage of fodder, meant that the livestock population of  the country had shrunk to "only about 40% of the population in 1929." Current  grain collections, Duranty continued, were "going badly."  </P> <P> Less than a month later, Duranty again visited the Embassy, this time as a  result of a dispatch he had written which paralleled his earlier conversation  with Strang. The Soviets had viewed the report as being unfavorable, and  shortly after its publication Duranty was visited by government emissaries who  reproached him with his unfaithfulness.  </P> <P> Duranty had planned a trip to Paris, but now postponed it, Strang wrote,  worried that he wouldn't be allowed back into the country. Other Western  correspondents documented the methods of coercion exercised by Soviet  authorities over foreign newsmen, chiefly the ominous threat of losing their  visas.  </P> <P> At about the same time, a curt announcement of the execution of 35 agricultural  officials for "wrecking" appeared in the Moscow papers. Forty others had been  given long prison sentences. Duranty was to attribute much of the mismanagement  of collectivization to this "quite efficient conspiracy," persisting with a  version of events that ignored all the outward signs of a major catastrophe.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a young man named Gareth Jones, who in early 1933 had taken a  three-week walking trip through the famine-stricken area, reported that he had  seen mass starvation. He announced this first in a press conference in Berlin,  then at a lecture in London and at last in a story written for the Manchester  Guardian, published only two days after Malcolm Muggeridge, who had been a  stringer for the Guardian in Moscow, had published a number of similar  dispatches.  </P> <P> According to another correspondent in Moscow, Jones' report, coming hard on the  heels of Muggeridge's eyewitness accounts, put the Soviet Press Office into a  terrible state. Knowing that the Western correspondents were desperate to cover  the Metro-Vickers trial (an industrial espionage trial of six Englishmen and a  number of Russians), a Soviet official indicated that the reporters would be  denied credentials if Jones' report were not repudiated. The reporters came to  the conclusion that "compelling professional necessity" required them to go  along with the request.  </P> <P> Duranty himself took the lead in disputing Jones' account. In an important  dispatch on March 31, 1933, one that worked out his rationale for  collectivization, Duranty agreed that it was "all too true that the novelty and  mismanagement of collective farming," plus a conspiracy in the agricultural  sector by "wreckers" and "spoilers," had "made a mess of Soviet food  production.  </P> <P> "But -- to put it brutally -- you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs,  and the Bolshevik leaders are just as indifferent to the casualties that may be  involved in their drive toward socialism as any general during the World War  who ordered a costly attack. . . . In fact, the Bolsheviki are more indifferent  because they are animated by fanatical conviction."  </P> <P> He was ready to agree that there had been "serious food shortages." But on the  question of starvation, "there is no actual starvation or deaths from  starvation but there is widespread mortality from disease due to malnutrition .  . . " It was cutting semantic distinction pretty slim, and it remains the most  outrageous equivocation of the period.  </P> <P> Jones didn't hesitate in striking back. He wrote to the New York Times,  (saying) he had visited some 20 villages where he saw incredible suffering, and  talked personally with peasants and officials who told him that indeed the  peasantry was starving to death. It was an uncompromising statement, but Jones  was up against an Establishment larger than Duranty. The newspapers in the West  were for the moment more interested in the Metro-Vickers trial than in any  reports of famine.  </P> <P> At long last, in September, 1933, Duranty headed south to report the famine.  </P> <P> His first three stories from Rostov-on-Don, the heart of the famine district,  consisted mostly of praise for the procedures used on the communal farms. He  spoke of happy workers and plentiful harvests. Any talk of famine, he said, was  "a sheer absurdity."  </P> <P> Once he reached Kharkov, new evidence forced him to change his tack  dramatically. "Early last year, under the pressure of the war danger in the Far  East," he reluctantly admitted, the authorities took too much grain from the  Ukraine. Meanwhile, a large number of peasants thought they could change the  Communist Party's collectivization policy by refusing to cooperate.  </P> <P> The only clue he offered to the devastation was a comparison of the famine to  the Battle of Verdun. But even this symbol of ultimate carnage fell short of  the mark. As scholar Marco Carynyk has pointed out, during World War I, people  were dying at the rate of 6,000 a day; in the Ukraine, peasants had died at the  rate of 25,000 a day.  </P> <P> The Ukrainian Famine of 1932-33 remains the greatest man-made disaster ever  recorded, exceeding in scale even the Jewish Holocaust of the next decade. It  was Duranty's destiny to become, in effect, the symbol for the West's failure  to recognize and understand it at the time.  </P> <P> When all is said and done, he alone, of all the witnesses to the terrible  events, had sufficient prestige to exert an influence. Had he, a Pulitzer  Prize-winner at the peak of his celebrity, spoken out in the pages of the New  York Times, the world could not have ignored him, as it did Muggeridge and  Jones, and events might have taken a different turn. If Duranty had taken a  stand, he might now be accounted one of the century's great, uncompromising  reporters. But he didn't.  </P> <P> When it came to discretion and expediency, the Western Establishment that feted  him, no less so than the Kremlin, had found their man.  </P> <P> 1990 by S.J. Taylor.

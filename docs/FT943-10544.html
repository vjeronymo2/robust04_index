			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: American Home truths It is so long since the pharmaceuticals industry saw an unsolicited bid that American Home Products' Dollars 8.5bn offer for American Cyanamid came as something of a shock. But while the nature of the bid and the whopping 50 per cent premium to the market share price are startling, the trend towards consolidation was already clear. The mergers which created SmithKline Beecham and Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Roche's agreed acquisition of Syntex in May, were steps in this direction. Since pressure on industry margins shows no sign of easing, further moves are likely. But the kind of multiple offered by American Home - 20 times this year's forecast earnings - only makes sense if costs can be cut without damaging the acquired business. The marriage of SmithKline and Beecham was successful in this regard, but neither party was dragged to the alter at gun-point. Cyanamid has outperformed the US market by 50 per cent from the trough in March, so management could be more than usually reluctant to surrender. Such considerations argue against an outbreak of hostile takeovers. Yet drugs companies which are struggling to deliver volume growth and are being squeezed on price by their customers may have little alternative but to look for appropriate partners. If the prices now being paid are any guide, a restructured drugs industry is worth substantially more than the current model. Yesterday's rise in the shares of other mid-sized drugs companies, such as Wellcome and Warner Lambert, is speculative but logical.</p>

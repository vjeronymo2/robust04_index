			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sergey Ponomarev: "When There Is No Bread, </F> Voters Have No Time For Manifestos"]    [Text] Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk -- The local legislative organ  elections in the Far East were valid only on Sakhalin. But even  on the island, where 51 candidates were running for the 16 seats  in the oblast duma, the results were very different from what  the organizers had expected. In two multiseat districts --  Korsakovskiy and Kholmskiy, which unite the central and southern  parts of the oblast as well as the Kuril Islands -- only  slightly more than 25 percent of registered voters turned out.  The turnout in Tymovskiy District in northern Sakhalin was  slightly higher at around 32 percent. But the most discouraging  poll result was the fact that the elections were almost wholly  ignored by the population of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk -- only 18  percent of voters turned out.    It is possible that the weather played a mean trick on the  election organizers -- as a result of heavy snow falls many  residents of the south of the island had no water for several  days, power supplies were intermittent, and no bread was  delivered to the stores.    Nonetheless, the main cause of the Sakhalin people's  political apathy, it seems to me, lies elsewhere. As one of  Russia's most "expensive" regions, the island is drifting from  one economic disaster to another. The lack of diversification  in the old economy, geared mainly to fishing and timber  procurement and enriching a narrow group of merchants and former  members of the party nomenklatura, has left most of the  population on its uppers, and there are only a few projects (of  dubious worth from the islanders' viewpoint) as evidence of the  widely trumpeted promises to "Taiwanize" Sakhalin and turn it  into a kind of oil and gas El Dorado.</p>

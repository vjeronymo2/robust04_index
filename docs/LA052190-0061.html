			<p><P> May 21, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC NOTES  </P> <P> Political and social instability, a labor shortage, high prices and rising  crime are making foreign and local investors look away from Taiwan.  </P> <P> Foreign investment approvals fell about 48% to $138 million in April from $267  million in 1989, the steepest fall in two years, the Investment Commission  said.  </P> <P> Overseas investment by the Taiwanese jumped 276% to $139 million from $37  million during the same period.  </P> <P> "In the past we were known as an investors' heaven, but these favorable factors  no longer exist in Taiwan," said Lu Ming-jen, economics professor at National  Chengchi University.  </P> <P> Economists said local and foreign businessmen were looking for somewhere else  with a better investment climate.  </P> <P> Constitutional reform protests, high prices and wages, and reports of a rising  crime rate had slowed foreign investment in Taiwan and were driving local money  out, they said.  </P> <P> Officials at the Bureau of Statistics said Taiwan's private domestic investment  would grow at a real 3.3% this year, down from last year's 5.44%. Domestic  investment rose 11% to 24% between 1986 and 1988.  </P></p>

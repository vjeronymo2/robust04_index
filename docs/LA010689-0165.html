They instead  added a Requiem Mass for victims of Armenia's devastating Dec. 7 earthquake.  </P> <P> Hundreds were expected to fill the church hall by the end of the three-hour  service, which began at 10:30 a.m. "This year we are not happy," church member  Wartini Jakerian said. "We are praying for our people."  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 21, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Connie Chung's agent said Monday she is "close" to making a decision about  whether to stay at NBC (her contract expires in late May) or jump to CBS.  Alfred Geller wouldn't hint at which way she's leaning, and muddied the  speculative waters further by saying if she does go to CBS, she might not work  on either "West 57th" or "60 Minutes." Rumors have circulated that she was  headed for one or the other of those CBS magazine shows. CBS has yet to replace  Diane Sawyer who left "60 Minutes" last month for a new job at ABC.

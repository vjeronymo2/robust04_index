Health Minister Datuk Lee Kim Sai said the unit set up under  the Disease Control Division of the Health Department last year  is manned by seven senior medical officers headed by a director.  The unit is responsible for the Malaysian program, strategy,  and approach in tackling the AIDS problem.    He said this at a news conference after presenting a check  for 100,000 ringgit [Malaysian currency] to the nongovernmental  organization's council on AIDS at the ministry. The financial  assistance is to help Malaysian AIDS Foundation to carry out its  activities. Datuk Lee said the special unit, which has replaced  the AIDS task force set up earlier, will monitor all AIDS cases  and take appropriate steps to control the disease.</p>

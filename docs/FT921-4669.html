			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Writs issued over audits at BCCI WRITS were issued in the High Court yesterday alleging negligence and claiming damages against Ernst &amp; Young over its 1986 audit of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International's holding company and one of its two main banking arms. The issuing of the writs is the first of what is expected to be a flurry of civil actions by administrators against advisers of the fraud-riddled bank which was closed down last July by the Bank of England. The writs, in the name of BCCI Holdings and BCCI SA, both registered in Luxembourg, allege negligence, breach of duty and breach of contract over their 1986 audits. Both banking entities are effectively under the control of Mr Brian Smouha of Touche Ross though - unlike BCCI SA  - BCCI Holdings, the holding company, is not yet in liquidation. The writs, which were also issued in Luxembourg, need to be filed before expiry of the five-year limit for bringing such actions under Luxembourg law. The 1986 audit was signed off on March 10 1987. Up to 1987 BCCI employed two sets of auditors for its main banks. Ernst &amp; Young audited BCCI SA and Price Waterhouse audited BCCI (Overseas), based in the Cayman Islands. The whole of the audit went to Price Waterhouse in 1987, when Ernst &amp; Young became unhappy with the arrangement and refused to be reappointed unless BCCI gave it the whole group. It also asked BCCI to make commitments to strengthen management and systems. One of the two writs lodged with the court yesterday named Ernst &amp; Whinney, since this was the trading name of the partnership before it merged with Arthur Young. Under the liquidation agreement for BCCI, negotiated between Touche Ross and Abu Dhabi but still to be approved by the Luxembourg court, the Sheikhdom would share 50-50 in any damages recovered from advisers. The Abu Dhabi government owns a majority stake in the bank. The 1986 audit of BCCI covered an important period for it. In that year Price Waterhouse carried out a review of treasury functions which proved to be one of the bank's most disastrous operations. Price Waterhouse wiped Dollars 225m off BCCI's profits for 1984 and 1985. The treasury losses were discovered later, however, to have been far higher. Mr Elwyn Eilledge, senior partner at Ernst &amp; Young, said: 'There are circumstances where protective writs may be appropriate but we believe these claims to be totally misconceived. We regret that this action is inevitably at the expense of depositors and creditors.'</p>

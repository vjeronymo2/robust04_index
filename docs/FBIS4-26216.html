			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 19 (XINHUA) -- China will allow more  overseas law firms to open offices in the country, especially  those of high credit that could help bring in investment, an  official from the Ministry of Justice said here today.    The number of pilot law firms from foreign countries and  from  Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan will be increased from the current  41 to around 100 by the end of 1995, said Shen Bailu, director  of the ministry's lawyers administration department, in an  interview with XINHUA.    "They will be allowed to open offices in more coastal cities  and provincial capitals than the current five cities of Beijing,  Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Haikou," Shen said, adding  that the move is part of China's effort to meet the rising  demand for foreign trade and economic cooperation.    However, the official noted, so-called "human rights  lawyers"  or "democracy lawyers," who might jeopardize China's social  stability and investment environment, "will be barred from  coming in."    Shen said China holds a tight rein on the operation of  overseas law firms in the country, because "restrictions in the  field of legal service are just common practice in the world."    Through pilot schemes, China is drawing experience on the  administration of overseas law firms in China, he said.  Relevant laws and regulations will be made to govern them in  the next several years to safeguard the Sino-overseas exchanges  and cooperation in the field of legal services, shen added.    The official said the overseas lawyers' offices have played  an important role in introducing investors and projects to  China. They have also handled quite a number of cases for  Chinese clients and provided consultation for both government  organs and enterpreneurs.    According to Shen, some 120 overseas law firms have lodged  formal applications to his ministry to set up offices in China,  whose economy is booming and where business opportunities abound.    While overseas law firms are coming in, their Chinese  counterparts are planning to set up offices abroad, shen said.  So far, two Chinese law firms have opened offices in the United  States and Singapore.    But shen said his ministry will be strict in approving such  offices to avoid random set-ups and only those with good  business prospects might be ratified to venture into overseas  markets.    The business operations of the two law firms abroad were  both  ranked "very good" by the ministry official.</p>

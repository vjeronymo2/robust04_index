			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "jc": "Meciar Was Speaking in the Park of </F> Culture and Repose; Another Movement for a Democratic Slovakia  Preelection Rally"]    [Excerpts] Bratislava--The overcrowded Theater Hall of the  Park of Culture and Repose was the scene of the second  preelection rally of Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]  (and Slovak National Party) supporters last night. It was  addressed by most members of the "shadow cabinet," with Vladimir  Meciar at the head. [passage omitted]    Responding to the criticism of the so-called wild  privatization in the last weeks and days of his government,  Vladimir Meciar declared that, in this way, the government  wanted to prevent the sellout of state property abroad and make  it possible for the employees of the privatized companies to  become their co-owners. [Former Minister of Culture] Dusan  Slobodnik told the rally in this context that the fall of  Meciar's government has been contributed to also by a certain  sector of foreign capital, which supposedly needed a more pliant  Slovak Government. The HZDS chairman spoke, furthermore, about  various pressures to sell the Slovak gas industry. A certain  Western financial group has supposedly offered our high-ranking  officials a commission of 1.6 billion korunas for being helpful  in this transaction. The HZDS Club of Deputies intends to  disclose the details at a meeting of the National Council of the  Slovak Republic, where it also plans to expose other facts about  the interest of some members of the present government in the  privatization of specific companies, about attempts to restore  Czechoslovakia, about the unlawful activities of the  Presidential Office, and the like. The main speaker also  criticized the provisional government's excessively  accommodating attitude toward, in particular, the Czech Republic  and Hungary, whereby it supposedly goes beyond the limits of  Slovakia's state interests.

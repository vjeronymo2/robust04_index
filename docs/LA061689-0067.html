			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CONFEREES DISCUSS 'KILLER' BEE QUARANTINE SITES AND EMERGENCY SERVICES  </P> <P> Agriculture officials from California, Texas and Arizona discussed plans  Thursday to quarantine sites of initial swarms of Africanized honey bees and  prepare emergency services in cases of massive stinging attacks if or when the  bees arrive to stay.  </P> <P> Task forces to handle the anticipated northward migration of Africanized bees  into the United States -- as early as next spring, some say -- are determining  how each state's agencies and departments should react.  </P> <P> Conferees at a symposium that ended Thursday in Mission Valley continued to  debate what impact the so-called "killer" bees might have in the more temperate  climates found in the United States. Africanized bees prefer tropical to  subtropical climes.  </P> <P> California has already been given the go-ahead by Gov. George Deukmejian to  appoint a task force to study the impact of the bees headed by the Department  of Food and Agriculture, said Len Foote, control and eradication chief of the  Department of Food and Agriculture.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Jeopardizing Honey Industry  </P> <P> The migration of the bees into California would jeopardize the $18-million  annual business of the honey industry, as well as result in loss of livestock  and small animals caused by mass stinging by the bees if precautionary steps  are not taken, conferees said.  </P> <P> Much of the infrastructure for the task forces, though, is already in place.  </P> <P> "California is prepared to deal with Africanized honey bees which arrive in  advance of the migratory front," Foote said. Baited hive traps have been set at  ports along California's coast to trap any swarms that might come over by ship,  he said.  </P> <P> A joint San Diego and Imperial counties task force should be in place by  October.  </P> <P> Approval for a Texas Africanized Honey Bee Management Plan is expected soon,  said John Thomas, an entomologist with the Texas Agricultural Extension  Service. The Texas plan, which the other states have followed in slightly  modified versions, stresses rapid detection and eradication of the isolated  Africanized colonies that are likely to precede the bees' main migratory  population.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Establishing Quarantine Zone  </P> <P> Once an Africanized colony has been identified, a 150-mile quarantine zone  around the area will be established, Thomas said. Conferees could not agree on  what methods would be most effective in handling the pest, if or when it  becomes well-established.  </P> <P> Two contingency plans in combatting the insect have emerged. One idea is to  destroy all feral, or non-commercial, bee colonies. Proponents of destroying  these "wild" bee colonies say it is necessary because the colonies' domestic  European bees are easily overtaken by the Africanized strain.  </P> <P> But some experts say that destroying all wild beehives is unrealistic.  Authorities are bound to miss some.  </P> <P> Bees "can nest just about anywhere," said Ivan Shields, director of the Arizona  Commission of Agriculture and Horticulture. "If that's happening now, it's  certainly going to happen with the Africanized variety, probably even more so."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mating Queens With Drones  </P> <P> Another idea is to continuously repopulate colonies with the European variety  of queens. The Texas plan requests funding for research into mating the  European queens with European drones under controlled conditions, Thomas said.  </P> <P> Under natural conditions, honey bees always mate in flight. The Africanized  drones, faster than their European counterparts, are generally more successful  in mating with a European queen. Previous, unsuccessful attempts at controlled  mating were conducted in cages or closed rooms with little or no regard to  flight behavior.  </P> <P> Researchers are looking into designing a wind tunnel to simulate natural  conditions for free-flying mating. If successful, such a wind tunnel could be  used for large-scale production of "pure" European honey bee queens. What is  not certain is how effective this method might be in combatting feral  Africanized colonies.  </P> <P> One of the more intriguing problems posed by the bee is liability in the event  of a stinging death. Under current laws, commercial bees -- those handled by  beekeepers for apiary products -- are classified as domestic animals, according  to Ivar Leetma, a San Diego attorney specializing in environmental issues.  Those laws may change with the advent of Africanized bees, Leetma said.  Governmental agencies could be held liable if signs warning of the danger of  the bees are not placed in public parks or other open areas where a stinging  death might occur, he said.  </P></p>

			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / International Company News: Pharmacia income gains 43% Pharmacia yesterday reported pro-forma operating income of SKr3.66bn (Dollars 463m) for 1993, the group's first full-year figures since being demerged from the Procordia group and acquiring Italian pharmaceuticals concern Farmitalia Carlo Erba (Fice). The Swedish pharmaceuticals and biotechnology company, one of the world's top 20 drugs companies, said the result was a 43 per cent improvement on operating income of SKr2.55bn in 1992. Pro-forma sales expanded to SKr27.4bn, up 22 per cent from SKr22.4bn. The group said the upturn was due almost entirely to currency movements. Volumes grew only a 'modest 1 per cent or 2 per cent,' according to Mr Jan Blomberg, executive vice-president, because of difficult conditions in important markets. The group's B shares fell SKr4 to close at SKr129. The state is planning to sell its 45 per cent stake in Pharmacia in May or June in a move which would raise some SKr16bn at current values. Exact timing of the offer will depend on whether Sweden decides to hold a referendum on membership of the European Union in June. In local currency terms, sales were 18 per cent higher in Japan, the group's largest market, and there were small increases in Italy, France and the UK. However, the group suffered a setback in the US, its second largest market, where local currency sales were down 10 per cent and in Spain and Germany, where they were 9 per cent lower. Pharmacia said the contribution from Fice was better than it expected when it acquired the company last May. The Italian unit's pro-forma operating income in 1993 rose to SKr1.07bn from SKr580m on revenues which were 23 per cent higher at SKr8.63bn. The company is proposing a SKr2.20 per share dividend. It believes conditions in many markets will continue to be difficult this year because of government clampdowns on healthcare spending. But it expects profits to improve due to cost cutting.</p>

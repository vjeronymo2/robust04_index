			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Money Markets: Overnight cut again THERE were signs of a small softening in European interest rates yesterday, with France, Portugal and Finland all easing monetary policy, writes James Blitz. At the start of the day, the Bank of France lowered its overnight rate of lending for the second time this week, reducing it from 8.75 per cent to 8.25 per cent. The franc has performed quite strongly inside the reformed European exchange rate mechanism in recent days, allowing the French authorities to ease monetary policy without fear of endangering the currency. The news led to a rise in French franc interest rate futures. The September franc contract gained 8 basis points to close at 93.16, while the December contract was up 7 at 94.28. Three-month French francs dropped sharply to about 7.07 per cent on the bid side at the close of trading from an earlier 8.00 per cent. A dealer suggested that one more cut in the overnight rate, to 7.75 per cent, would be enough to trigger moves in the more internationally sensitive official rates. He recalled that the five to 10-day lending rate was at 7.75 per cent before the recent rise to 10 per cent - and that it could soon be lowered to that level again. In Germany, the figures for M3 money supply growth for July had little effect on the market, coming in below expectations at 7.5 per cent, from 7.0 per cent in June. Dealers expected that the August figure, which would comprise heavy intervention to support the franc, would come in a good deal higher. But December Euromark futures were down only 4 basis points yesterday at a close of 93.99. Sterling futures continued to fall on the back of Wednes-day's comments from a UK government minister that another interest rate cut should not be anticipated. The September short sterling contract declined 1 basis point to finish at 94.15. Lower expectations of a rate cut were also reflected in the cash yield curve. Although three-month money was unchanged at 5 7/8 per cent, both six-month and one-year cash rates were slightly higher, the latter closing at 5 7/8 per cent from a previous 5 9/16 per cent. In the discount market there was a large shortage of Pounds 1.45bn, which was difficult to remove. There was late assistance of Pounds 550m and the overnight rate peaked at 7.50 per cent.</p>

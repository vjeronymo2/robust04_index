			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Row grows over Labour regions Labour's ruling National Executive Committee yesterday defied a threat by the party's northern region to break away, and insisted that it would press ahead with plans to merge the party's north of England and Yorkshire regions. The merger plans have prompted opposition in the northern region - which covers Northumberland, Tyne and Wear, Durham, Cleveland and Cumbria - where officials are to ballot the 30,000 members on whether to declare independence from the rest of the party. The NEC said that the decision to merge the regions had been taken by last month's party conference - as part of cost cuts - and could not be rescinded. But some in the region dispute this view, and the NEC also agreed to summon northern region officials to London to try to persuade them to abandon the ballot. Northern region officials believe the merger would rob them of their identity. Mr Nick Anderson, northern region chairman of the Labour party, said: 'We are determined the NEC should be made aware not just of the views of the northern region executive but of the entire Labour party northern region, on the basis of one-member-one-vote.' Mr Anderson, who is also northern region secretary of the GMB general union, added: 'We hope when they have the ballot results they will take them into account.' The GMB, the area's biggest union, said members were incensed at the insensitivity of the merger proposals. It said the NEC had failed to understand what the party's northern region had done in the last 14 years to create regional structures to help withstand the rundown of manufacturing industry and promote a regional identity. The results of the ballot are expected to be announced at a delegate conference in the new year, probably in February.</p>

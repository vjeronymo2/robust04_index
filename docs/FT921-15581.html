			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Bush In Japan: Poor image works against American 'gas guzzlers' - Why the Japanese steer clear of imported cars PRESIDENT George Bush's car sales pitch in Japan this week has apparently had an impact. At Chrysler's largest showroom in downtown Tokyo, the number of potential customers walking through the automatic doors has doubled since the US president landed - from a meagre five a day to a Bush-inspired 10. 'People have become more curious, but American cars still have a poor image among Japanese,' a Chrysler salesman explained. 'They ask me whether the lights are faulty and they worry about fuel consumption. Some models don't have enough gadgets to keep drivers happy. We Japanese love gadgets.' The presence of Mr Bush and his entourage of executives from the Big Three US manufacturers - GM, Ford and Chrysler - has generated much publicity for the US industry, but it remains unclear whether the visit will prompt an increase in sales of US cars. About 12,350 vehicles made by the three US companies were sold in the the first 11 months of last year. For the whole year, the Japan Automobile Dealers' Association (Jada) reported sales of 5.74m units, including 199,920 imported vehicles, sales of which were down 10.7 per cent on 1990. The travelling US executives argue the domestic market has been a 'sanctuary' for Japanese producers, who have ploughed domestic earnings into aggressively building market share in the US and Europe. But the executives have identified few reasons for Japanese consumers' continuing reluctance to buy their product. At Chrysler, which has four showrooms in Japan, a salesman suggested that Japanese consumers have failed to recognise the advances made by US makers in recent years, although the makers still export over-large cars which don't fit the market or Japanese streets. Unfortunately for the US companies, some of their best customers over the past two decades have been the yakuza, Japanese gangsters, who have a well-known fondness for cars such as GM's Cadillac. Chrysler sales staff are encouraged to be cool in dealing with gangsters, who apparently like the company's Imperial model, which is 5.165 metres long and costs Y6.2m (Pounds 26,700) before taxes. 'If we know that a customer is a gangster, perhaps we will not provide them with the finance to buy the car. We are very conscious of the image of our company,' an official said. US manufacturers have not always had such a tiny portion of the Japanese market. Foreign makers, with Ford and GM leading the pack, held a 95 per cent share in the early 1930s, a figure which fell sharply after the government introduced a law in 1936 torestrict imports and the assembly of foreign companies' vehicles in Japan. By 1939, foreign makers were squeezed out completely, though they returned at the end of the war in 1945, and imports accounted for 44.6 per cent of the market in 1951. The introduction of steep tariffs and the gradual development of the Japanese industry, assisted by foreign technology transfers and government funding, reduced the share to 8.9 per cent in 1955 and to 0.4 per cent in 1969. Foreign investment in the Japanese industry was effectively prohibited until 1970 and the government inconveniently insisted, until 1983, that each imported car be inspected by customs officers. Meanwhile, the quality of the domestic product had improved significantly, and exports grew from 194,000 in 1965 to 6.1m in 1984. US manufacturers suggest that access to the Japanese market is still restricted, but Japanese companies insist the quality and price competitiveness of their vehicles are behind the marginal gains made by foreign vehicles in the past decade. Jada says its members, most of whom have direct links to Japanese manufacturers, are ready to sell US vehicles, but that these cars are not tailored to Japanese taste.</p>

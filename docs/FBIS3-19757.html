The National Assembly delegation headed by Assembly Speaker  Sa'di Mahdi Salih demanded that this issue be added to the  agenda of the IPU conference, which was opened by French  President Francois Mitterrand earlier today.    The correspondent of the Iraqi News Agency in Paris said  that  the parliamentary delegations attending the conference,  representing 125 countries, will discuss the Iraqi proposal and  make a decision on it.    The week-long conference will discuss the means of averting  international conflicts; the United Nations' peacekeeping role;  protecting the environment; the international political,  economic, and social situation; and the possible drafting of a  plan to remedy inequality between men and women in politics.</p>

Particularly when it comes to major infrastructure projects, D66  sets great store by the protection of the environment and  landscape. The Betuwe [train] line must still be built in a  ditch and partly underground; the extension of Schiphol  [Amsterdam airport] must take environmental factors more closely  into account. [passage omitted]    At the election conference, D66 formally designated Van  Mierlo as its leading candidate Lower House elections. In the  fight for the candidacy for the European Parliament, the  incumbent MEP [member of the European parliament], J.W. Bertens,  defeated his competitor, top European official L.J. Brinkhorst.  Bertens gained 350 votes, Brinkhorst 300.    On Saturday morning, the party summit announced how D66  would  make the extra savings of 2.5 billion guilders, on top of the  10.5 billion called for in its draft program. The extra amount  for restructuring will be found by cutting back on agricultural  subsidies, civil servants salaries, road building, the WW  [unemployment benefits act], family allowances, and the AWW  [general widows and orphans act]. [passage omitted]    Until 1998, D66 wants the provisional package of 13 billion  guilders to [help] create approximately 100,000 jobs, including  6,000 in the area of education, 10,000 in the police force, and  18,000 in the health care sector.    According to Van Mierlo, the CDA [the Christian Democratic  Appeal] and VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] "are  being tremendously gutsy" by increasing their savings much more  rapidly for the sake of employment. The CDA intends to save a  total of 17 billion, the VVD 20 billion. The PvdA [Labor Party]  is proceeding on the basis of partial separation of wages and  benefits, which will benefit people covered by the Pensions Act.  However, D66 wants those pensioners with substantial  supplementary pensions to pay a premium on their state pension,  so that, in effect, they will contribute to the maintenance of  this provision for their old age.    Compared with the other major parties, D66 goes rather far  with its increases in energy taxes (raising the price of natural  gas for households) and with its reductions on labor taxes. On  balance, D66 arrives at an average annual tax reduction of 450  guilders per taxpayer.    In his speech, party chief Van Mierlo accused the cabinet of  having damaged political credibility and alienating citizens.  The examples he cited included the decision on Zestienhoven,  and the letter from Minister Bukman on natural gas prices for  truck farmers.    Van Mierlo said: "The most serious thing, to my mind, is  that the cabinet thinks it can get away with this. The prime  minister described Bukman's letter as `superfluous and  constitutionally erroneous.' This now applies to the entire  cabinet."</p>

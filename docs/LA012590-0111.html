			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AZTECS ARE BULLISH ABOUT DOW;  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL: OK, SO HE'S NOT SO HOT IN A COW PASTURE. THE 7-FOOT-1  CENTER HAS HAD A BIG IMPACT ON THE COURT FOR SAN DIEGO STATE.  </P> <P> It was late at night. They were out in the middle of some field, shrouded in  darkness and surrounded by mystery.  </P> <P> There was mooing.  </P> <P> Six months later, 7-foot-1 Marty Dow would be playing center for the San Diego  State University basketball team. On this night last year, though, he was on an  outing. A few friends had dragged him out to the pastures for a night of  cow-tipping.  </P> <P> "I just stood there and watched," Dow said. "I was too scared. They had done it  before."  </P> <P> His friends spied a sleeping cow. They snuck up on it and pushed. Tip, thud,  chuckle. The cow hit the ground, mooed and got back up.  </P> <P> "They always told me they went cow-tipping," Dow said. "I never believed them."  </P> <P> An easy grin crossed Dow's face. He shifted in his chair.  </P> <P> Ah, memories.  </P> <P> When you're a basketball player, you play basketball. You go wherever you can  find a team, wherever there is a position open. And when you get there,  sometimes you find yourself doing zany things with the locals.  </P> <P> The bouncing ball has taken Dow from high school in Aurora, Colo., to the  University of Cincinnati, Northeastern Oklahoma A&amp;M and, finally, to SDSU.  Dow has been a pleasant surprise for the Aztecs this season, stepping into the  starting lineup immediately and improving each week. He has started all 19  games, averaging 12.1 points and six rebounds.  </P> <P> The interesting thing about those numbers is that they are more impressive than  his statistics last season at Northeastern Oklahoma A&amp;M. There, for the  national community college champions, he scored 8.3 points a game and also  averaged six rebounds. He didn't start. It was a guard-oriented offense, and  Dow had to be content watching shorter guys toss up rainbows from the outside.  The Norsemen went 36-4.  </P> <P> When the season ended, Dow went cow-tipping. What else was there to do? Shoot,  there were about 15,000 people in Miami, Okla. And there were only about 1,500  students at Northeastern Oklahoma A&amp;M.  </P> <P> "It was different," Dow said. "The school had its own farm. You're an athlete,  or you're an aggie. That was pretty much it."  </P> <P> He made some friends. They saw a few movies at the local theater; the movies  had been released three or four months earlier, but they were only a buck.  </P> <P> Dow and his friends also played a lot of cards.  </P> <P> When you're a basketball player, you go where you can find a team.  </P> <P> His first college stop was Cincinnati, but there were problems between Dow and  Tony Yates, then the team's coach.  </P> <P> "I didn't think I was really getting along with the coach very well," is all  Dow will say on the matter.  </P> <P> He got some garbage time during his freshman season there and then was  red-shirted during his sophomore season. He left midway through his second  year, after calling an old friend of the family: Jim Brandenburg.  </P> <P> Dow's high school teams had attended some of Brandenburg's basketball camps  when Brandenburg was the coach at Wyoming. Brandenburg, in fact, recruited Dow  but lost out when Cincinnati made a late push before the fall early-signing  date during Dow's senior season.  </P> <P> So when things didn't work out at Cincinnati, Dow called Brandenburg, who by  this time had accepted the coaching job at SDSU.  </P> <P> "He said he didn't have any scholarships left and that it would be pretty  expensive to pay my own way," Dow said. "He said he would see what he could do  about helping me find a junior college for a year."  </P> <P> So Dow packed his bags and took off for Northeastern Oklahoma A&amp;M. A year  later, faced with the loss of center Mitch McMullen, Brandenburg had a position  and a scholarship, and Dow moved again. When you're 7-1 with a good work ethic  and a pair of nice, soft hands to shoot the basketball, you can generally find  a place to play.  </P> <P> Although his height is one of his attributes, it was about as welcome as an  outbreak of measles when it first snuck up on him. He started summer vacation  at the end of his freshman year in high school at 6-feet. By the time he  stepped through the front door to return for his sophomore year, he was 6-7.  </P> <P> "It used to bother me a lot," he said. "I had a real problem with it in high  school. They made fun of me, and I was real gangly. I couldn't walk and chew  gum at the same time.  </P> <P> "Now, I love it. I wouldn't change anything."  </P> <P> Dow, a junior, has surprised quite a few people this season. He has outplayed  Villanova's 7-3 center Tom Greis twice, and he out-rebounded New Mexico's 7-2  Luc Longley last week.  </P> <P> The first game against Greis was the Aztecs' season-opener in the Maui Classic,  and that was the real shocker. Dow had 15 points and six rebounds. Greis had 14  and three.  </P> <P> "He kicked Greis' rear end," Brandenburg said. "From there, I thought, 'Maybe  this kid is a gamer.' He works hard in practice, but he takes it to another  level in games."  </P> <P> The second game against Villanova was for the championship of the annual SDSU  holiday tournament and broadcast nationally on ESPN. It was the first time  Dow's father, an Episcopalian minister, and mother were able to watch him on  television. Dow had 11 points and five rebounds, and Greis had five and six.  </P> <P> Last week against New Mexico, Dow out-rebounded Longley, 11-7, but Longley had  22 points and Dow had 13.  </P> <P> Since Western Athletic Conference play started Jan. 4, Dow has led the Aztecs  in scoring (15 points a game) and rebounding (6.3). He is shooting 64% from the  field in WAC games (52.5% overall), which is good for third in the conference.  He has scored in double figures in each of the past five games.  </P> <P> "He has played a lot of good minutes for us in the last 10 or 12 games,"  Brandenburg said. "I think he's more confident. I've been very pleased with his  progress. I think he's getting better all the time."  </P> <P> Dow said he would like to improve his defense. That will come with hard work  and, maybe, a little more weight. Right now, he is a reed-thin 240 pounds. He  hasn't lifted many weights since a back injury in September, but he has  promised himself to start as soon as the season has finished.  </P> <P> "He needs to put on some solid muscle this summer and fall," Brandenburg said.  "I can see where he could be a nice force in this conference next year."  </P></p>

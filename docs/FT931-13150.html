			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Minorco's stance may hinder JCI plans PLANS BY Johannesburg Consolidated Investment, the South African mining company, to buy a 29.9 per cent stake in Johnson Matthey, the precious metals group, may not go unchallenged. Charter Consolidated, the UK industrial conglomerate, owns a 38.4 per cent stake worth about Pounds 350m in Johnson Matthey. It has been discussing selling to JCI a 29.9 per cent stake to avoid triggering a full bid for JM, and would have sold the rest of its shares in the market. However, Minorco, the European-based investment arm of Anglo-American which holds a 36 per cent stake in Charter, yesterday pointed out that any such transaction would require the approval of Charter shareholders. Minorco said it had supported Charter's plans to seek ways of realising its investment in JM, but would examine any proposals put to it by Charter to ensure that any disposal was in the best interests of all shareholders. Analysts took that as suggesting that Minorco would want Charter to obtain the best price for its JM stake, regardless of whether the sale led to a takeover bid. JCI would be acceptable to JM because it is thought to have no intention of bidding for the entire company. If the sale of the JM shares does go ahead, Charter could use the proceeds to repurchase Minorco's stake in the company. Charter would have preferred to announce both deals simultaneously, but accepts that the leaking of the disposal story means that it is only likely to be able to proceed in stages. JM's shares rose last week on speculation that Charter had been approached by a company wanting to buy its entire interest. Yesterday they closed 8p higher at 506p, while Charter shed 6p to 692p.</p>

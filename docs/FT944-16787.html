			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Hints of cut in M-way spending Dr Brian Mawhinney, the transport secretary, yesterday called for a new debate on the future of roadbuilding in Britain amid signs that the government is preparing to curtail spending on trunk roads and motorways. In his first speech as a minister to a Conservative party conference, Dr Mawhinney gave a clear indication that he is reassessing the annual Pounds 2bn road-building programme he inherited from his predecessor, Mr John MacGregor. He spelled out his commitment to 'manage the existing road work in the most effective manner', and to minimise new trunk-road building through open countryside and cities. He also announced a range of measures to combat car pollution including the introduction of tougher emission standards for diesel vehicle emission and random spot checks on polluting vehicles in major cities. 'People are worried about the effect road schemes have on the landscape, historic sites, woodlands and on wildlife,' he told the conference. 'Part of our response is to carry out environmental assessments of all road schemes.' Talking to journalists yesterday, the transport secretary said he was undertaking a reassessment of the future of roadbuilding. 'I have started to ask a few questions about the programmes I have inherited. We are now going to enter a debate as we seek to find a balance between the economic, social and environmental criteria of road building policy.' On rail policy, Dr Mawhinney gave the first confirmation since the end of the rail strike that the government would press ahead with the privatisation of Railtrack. 'Our country needs a modern and efficient railway,' he told delegates. 'As with every privatisation, this will improve efficiency, free up investment, enhance services that the customer wants and expand choice.' He was warmly applauded by delegates after announcing that driving licences will carry photographs from July 1996. He said that some 85 per cent of respondents to a recent consultation exercise had approved the idea. Rail rules, Page 15</p>

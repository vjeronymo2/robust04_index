			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Leslaw Maleszka: "Third UD Congress: Stitching </F> Together What Has Unraveled"]    [Text] By an overwhelming majority of votes, the Third  Democratic Union [UD] Congress adopted a declaration on joining  forces with the Liberal Democratic Congress. The unification  congress of the two parties will take place toward the end of  April.    There were 318 delegates voting in favor of the union, four  who voted against, and 27 who abstained from casting their  votes. Suggestions of a name to be given to the eventual new  party included such propositions as "Liberal Democratic Union,"  "Democratic Congress," and "New Democracy."    Fortunately, attempts to avert a major conflict that  threatened to "blow up" the Congress ended in a successful  resolution of the underlying problem just a dozen or so hours  before the official opening of the deliberations. During a  session of the UD presidium that lasted from late Friday night  through the early hours of Saturday, Tadeusz Mazowiecki agreed  to stay on as UD chairman and to run as candidate in the  forthcoming election of the leader of the new united party.  Everyone joined in persuading Mazowiecki to stay: Bronislaw  Geremek, Wladyslaw Frasyniuk, Jan Rokita, and other parliament  members collected signatures on an open petition concerning this  matter, while local UD circles kept sending in telex messages in  support of Mazowiecki's continuing chairmanship. Finally,  Mazowiecki decided to stay out--and was applauded by the  assembled delegates in a standing ovation. He replied with a  concluding address in which he firmly demanded strict loyalty  from all of the leaders of the individual UD factions. "Maybe I  really am too slow, and maybe I do indeed need to be prompted  into acting, but this can be done internally within the party  rather than through outside manipulation. I would prefer other  ways of finding out about a whole variety of controversial  utterances made by my colleagues than coming across them as I  listen to broadcasts of radio programs.    It is true that Mazowiecki plays the role of "middleman," or  mediator in UD: He reconciles sides and settles conflicts when  it comes to program-oriented and tactical differences between  the party's right wing (represented by Rokita) and the left wing  (headed by Frasyniuk). In internal "Unionese" language,  Mazowiecki is sometimes dubbed "Paper Clip" or "Safety Pin," to  denote his ability to pin back together what has become  unraveled.  <H5>  UD Congress Program Debate </H5>   There are really no substantive differences over party  program between supporters of the number of separate factions  within UD. Faction leaders were unanimous on this point,  regardless of the fact that they had earlier--sometimes as  recently as a few days before the Congress--insisted that a  split in the party was inevitable.    Marek Dabrowski emphasized the need to present an integrated  vision of a social and economic program. Jacek Kuron asserted  that UD faced an obvious dilemma between the concept of a  rational economic policy and the need to demonstrate sensitivity  to social needs and expectations. The way out of this dilemma  can only be through social movements galvanizing citizens to  engage in a reform program, and certainly not a war waged  against the state budget by the trade unions.    The final Congress declaration was formulated along similar  lines: Social discontent was caused by the left-wing  coalition's failure to realize the promises it had made during  the election campaign as well as from the lack of a clear-cut  concept of the necessary reforms. Nevertheless, social conflicts  should be resolved at a debating table rather than through  organized strikes.    UD radicals engaging in strong campaigns against the  Catholic  Church took a rapping across the knuckles. Jerzy Turowicz  argued that anticlericalism engendered unnecessary conflicts in  a situation where even the church itself, through the words of  such authorities as John Paul II or Bishop Tadeusz Pieronek,  secretary to the Polish Episcopate, supports the idea that a  state should officially adopt a neutral worldview. A most  forceful line of argument tackling the same subject was put  forward by Aleksander Smolar: "Various politicians, mostly more  popular than eminent, have misrepresented UD's real position  through their utterances on church-state relations. There are  limits to such misrepresentation, and those who overstep them  should look for suitable niches for themselves outside UD."    Smolar's words were interpreted by the audience as an  allusion to some recent statements by Barbara Labuda referring  to "creeping clericalization of the state." The culprit herself  failed to reply to the challenge. She was absent from the  debating hall throughout the second day of the Congress.</p>

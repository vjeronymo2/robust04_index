			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Mexican Crisis: Mexico's violence claims a rare victim from politics Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio was shot as he was leaving a campaign rally in the sprawling city of Tijuana, the fourth largest in Mexico, just over the border from San Diego. He was Mexico's first presidential candidate to be assassinated since President-elect Alvara Obregon was murdered in 1928. Since then Mexico had enjoyed remarkable political stability, with every president having lived out his term, peacefully handing power over to his successor. Inevitably there was speculation that the assassination, coming so soon after the New Year's peasant uprising in the state of Chiapas, had been planned by groups that were set on damaging the Mexican government, or seeking to replace Mr Colosio with a presidential candidate more favourable to their interests. As of yesterday there was no evidence of any conspiracy. Police in Tijuana arrested Mario Aburto Martinez for the killing. Mr Aburto, 23, an industrial mechanic, had been grabbed by eyewitnesses and dragged to the nearest police station. Police have not linked Mr Aburto to any group. The Attorney-General's office said Mr Aburto confessed to the killing in the presence of local lawyers, and to buying the pistol several weeks ago with the purpose of assassinating Mr Colosio. It said it had forensic proof Mr Aburto had shot twice from a .38 pistol. Police investigations were continuing. According to the Attorney-General's Office, Mr Aburto said he was a pacifist, and claimed to have written several books. The police also detained a second man, Vicente Mayoral, although it appeared he was just a witness to the shooting. Given the widespread violence in Mexico, and the few security precautions politicians take, it was remarkable that so long had passed without such a political assassination. In 1990 Mexico suffered 30.7 murders per 100,000 people, more than Brazil, and compared with 13.3 in the US. Last year drug traffickers accidentally killed Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas of Guadalajara in a shoot-out with a rival gang, according to the official explanation. Last week an unknown group of men kidnapped Mr Alfredo Harp Helu, co-head of Banamex, Mexico's largest bank. Tijuana, a city whose population, thanks to migration and economic integration with the US, has nearly tripled in 20 years to an official 900,000, is one of Mexico's most violent cities. Long known for its sleazy bars and nightclubs, it has more recently become a centre for drug traffickers, and home to thousands of factories, and the shanty towns that surround them. Mr Colosio was on the edge of one of the shanty town when giving his last speech. Like all Mexican politicians he though nothing of mingling with the crowd after giving his speech. That will now change.</p>

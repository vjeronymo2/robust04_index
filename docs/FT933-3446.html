			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Arts: Schreier's 'Liederabend' delights - Weekend music in London The Wigmore Hall season of 'Master Concerts' began on Saturday with a Liederabend by Peter Schreier, received with respectful delight. In the Austro-German song repertoire he is, I suppose, the premier tenor of our day; given his austerely idealised notion of how Lieder should be sung, he has no peer, and few competitors. Between thrusting tenors with larynxes focussed upon opera, and sensitive artists - mostly British - with white-ish voices on the Pears model, sincere intentions and stilted German, the middle ground is under-populated. Except for Josef Protschka and perhaps Laurence Dale, no younger tenors stand out just now in Lieder. Since the cruelly premature death of Fritz Wunderlich (at 36, in a trivial accident), there has been no comparable tenor to match him, not with the kind of voice Schubert must have had in mind for his Schone Mullerin: lightly natural, expressive and heartfelt, with no need for strenuous Italian top-notes. If Schreier is not exactly that kind of tenor, in his particular way he is the Compleat Artist. There used to be jokes about his surname (meaning 'screamer', as in 'Your baby is a real Schreier, isn't he]') that were quite off the mark - except for his upper register, which sometimes strikes my ear as uncomfortably tight and overwrought, perhaps because he controls it so strictly to keep it in line with his easier middle-voice. He cultivates a seamless legato, for with him the line is the essential thing, most delicately and scrupulously inflected. Vocal colour-effects probably strike him as vulgar in the great Lieder, and he eschews them. In this recital he allowed himself just the odd moment of audible theatre; otherwise his tone was consistently bright, forthright, unassuming, without much depth. His diction is immaculate and he is no less searching with the texts than Schubert himself, or even Hugo Wolf. Everything has been thought out and polished to the hilt. There is a sense that precious objects are being reverently displayed. Not that there is anything remotely pretentious in Schreier's platform manner: on the contrary, he is the very image of the affable, sympathetic bank manager you never had. At the Wigmore this time he sang Schubert and Brahms, including some of the latter's late, lusty 'folk songs'; a last-minute decision to reverse the two halves of the programme was a good idea, for then the 'folk songs' laced his recital with a deceptively relaxed, informal air from the outset. All the rest of his 'serious' Brahms was exquisitely shaped and shaded, further enhanced by Graham Johnson's searching accompaniments. So also Schreier's Schubert - and Johnson's. I think the latter has learned to be an unintrusive but genuinely inspired Schubert accompanist in the course of his monumental recording project (the complete Schubert songs with the best Schubert singers, on Hyperion CDs). 'Ganymed', on one of Goethe's most erotically subversive poems, was a marvel of subtle, suggestive tact. In his 'Uber allen Gipfeln', and in Ruckert's 'Du bist die Ruh', the singer underlined the lofty contours so that we could not miss them. Simpler might have been better  - but Schreier is a long way beyond that now, and he is an artist of rare distinction.</p>

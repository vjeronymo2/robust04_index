			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / UK aims at compromise over European forces BRITAIN outlined proposals last night for military forces to come under the authority of the Western European Union. It accepted for the first time that the controversial joint corps planned by France and Germany might be among the forces made available to the WEU. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, insisted however that Nato should have first call on troops in the event of a crisis. He said he hoped WEU ministers would reach a consensus at a meeting in Germany on June 19. But it was unclear yesterday whether the UK proposals, expected to be welcomed by Washington because of their emphasis on Nato ties, can form the basis of a compromise. The row over how Europe should move towards forming its own military capability has been brewing for the past year, after Nato drew up plans for a British-led rapid reaction corps and France and Germany countered with proposals for a joint corps under separate command. The Franco-German plan bewildered both the US and Britain, which saw it as competing with Nato. President Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl are to finalise plans for the corps next week. The 35,000-strong corps is due to be in place in October 1995. Mr Rifkind said the corps, which Bonn and Paris have invited other WEU members to join, could be among forces made available to the WEU. These might also include the current UK/Netherlands Amphibious Force and the new air mobile division which Britain, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium are setting up as part of the Nato's rapid reaction forces. UK officials made clear no British troops would be assigned to the Franco-German corps. Mr Rifkind said command of European forces in cases where Nato was not involved would come under the WEU's council of ministers, and a special planning cell would draw up contingency plans. But he opposed setting up standing WEU forces or a command structure in parallel with Nato's. In a lecture to the Centre for Defence Studies in London, Mr Rifkind made an apparent concession by accepting that the WEU might use forces in certain circumstances within Europe. But this would only happen when Nato chose not to be engaged, for instance in humanitarian operations. Bonn has assured Britain that German troops in the Franco-German corps will remain assigned to Nato. French forces are outside Nato's military structure, but arrangements are envisaged for the whole corps to come under Nato operational command in the event of a war in Europe.</p>

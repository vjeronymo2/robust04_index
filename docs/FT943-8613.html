			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / International Company News: Charter sets new deadline for Esab bid Charter, the UK industrial group, has declined to raise its stalled Pounds 260m (Dollars 400m) bid for Esab, the Swedish welding group, but extended its original offer for two weeks to August 26 in the hope of a change of mind by reluctant Esab shareholders. The UK company said it had received acceptances at its offer price of SKr345 a share worth 53.1 per cent of the voting capital in Esab by last Friday's initial deadline. With shares acquired in the market, Charter is assured of 57.3 per cent of the votes in Esab. But the bid, recommended by the Esab board, is conditional on Charter receiving 90 per cent acceptances and has been blocked by Swedish institutional shareholders who say it is underpriced. Since the bid was launched in late June, Esab has raised its earnings forecast and its share price has risen as high as SKr365. The share price has been kept high by the expectation that Charter will raise its offer.</p>

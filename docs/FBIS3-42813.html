Is it necessary to mention  what an enormous role this has been called upon to play in  providing assistance to the working individual, improving his  health and treating him? As long as trade unions managed  Russia's Social Insurance Fund, it completely coped with these  goals.    Last year, as is known, an edict of the Russian Federation's  president transferred the fund's management to the government  "with the participation of the all-Russian trade unions."    At the time, RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA and other publications warned  the people: This document unties the hands of the executive  branch's civil servants to patch holes in the state budget using  social insurance, as has already occurred with the pension fund.    Seemingly, this forecast has started to come true. On 17  January, Yuriy Shatyrenko, the fund's chairman, adopted a decree  without considering the opinion of the trade unions and the  board of directors. It ordered them to abolish the fund's  separate central branch departments and transfer the property,  which had been acquired using social insurance assets, to the  fund's central executive board of directors. On 21 January, this  same Yu. Shatyrenko sent a teletype message to the heads of the  regional administrations about suspending the issuing of joint  stock in the trade unions' sanitarium and health resort system.    It is impossible to call the actions of the Social Insurance  Fund's leadership anything other than arbitrariness since they  were completely contrary to a whole series of legal acts. We  will mention only the main ones. In the new Russian Federation  Constitution, it is written: "Any normative legal acts affecting  the rights, freedoms and duties of the individual and citizen  cannot be applied if they have not been published officially for  general information." The Social Insurance Fund decree has not  been published.    Let us also recall the president's edict, according to  which,  first, the new procedure for managing social insurance is called  a temporary one -- until the Federal Assembly adopts special  legislation. Second, management was entrusted to two subjects  possessing equal rights: the government and the trade unions.  Third, it was also ordered that "the existing procedure for  paying state social insurance and for financing expenditures for  these purposes should be retained in enterprises,  establishments, organizations, and other economic agencies  regardless of the form of ownership until legislation is  adopted." In other words, the procedure for paying through  branch and regional departments of the Social Insurance Fund of  the all-Russian trade unions should exist even today because  nothing else existed at the time the president's edict was  published.    Conclusion: The fund's new masters have displayed not only  an  extreme lack of respect for the country's constitution, which  has direct effect, but also for their management partners -- the  trade unions -- and, in them, for millions of workers also.  Mikhail Shmakov, the chairman of the Federation of Independent  Trade Unions of Russia, and Vyacheslav Goncharov, his deputy,  who were alarmed by this development of events, met with Yu.  Shatyrenko, chairman of the Russian Federation's Social  Insurance Fund. A joint teletype message was sent to the heads  of the local administrations and the directors of the regional  trade associations as a result of the discussions. It informed  them that the fund was retracting its claims to the property of  the trade unions' sanitarium and health resort installations.    The directors of the branch trade unions, which are in the  Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia, unanimously  spoke out in their meeting also for abrogating the fund  chairman's decree of 17 January.    Word for Word    Mikhail Shmakov, chairman of the Federation of Independent  Trade Unions of Russia, said during the discussion of the  critical situation that had been created:    "The leadership of the Social Insurance Fund and its  chairman, Yu. Shatyrenko, assume that trade union activists have  been so occupied with current social insurance matters on social  principles that they will not continue further. No, it is  necessary to continue the situation to the end: If the  reorganized fund assumes all management and threatens another's  property -- let it not count on us. Let it establish a new  machinery whose size will increase by far. It will barely live  on the percentages, which are withheld from wages for social  insurance. Nothing will remain for payments.    "Let them know in the fund that our protest is not a mutiny  by the Federation of Independent Trade Union of Russia leaders.  The boycott will be universal -- from the top to the bottom.    "We will invite Yu. Shatyrenko to visit us and we will put  the question to him point-blank: Either he revokes his decrees  or we will be forced to look for other ways."</p>

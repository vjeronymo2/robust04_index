			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Turmoil on bond markets hits M4 lending Turmoil on the bond markets in February fed through to the money supply figures last month. A Pounds 1.95bn repayment of debt by securities dealers meant that sterling lending to the M4 private sector was just Pounds 600m on a seasonally adjusted basis, compared with market forecasts of Pounds 1.8bn. It was the second consecutive month that M4 lending was much weaker than expected and followed a lending figure of Pounds 141m in January. The main factor behind February's weakness appears to have been the need for securities dealers to repay debt and reduce their vulnerability to further price falls in the bond market. According to the British Bankers Association, dealers borrowed Pounds 2bn in October and November, money which probably helped finance the end-of-year surge in bond prices. But prices fell sharply in February. Mr John Shepperd, chief economist at Yamaichi International (Europe), said: 'The inference (from the lending figures) is that securities houses have reduced their positions in the bond market.' The BBA reported that total sterling lending by the main British banking groups to the UK private sector fell Pounds 244m in February, following a rise of Pounds 652m in January. Consumer borrowing was a weak Pounds 38m, down from a revised Pounds 82m in January. Lord Inchyra, director general of the BBA, said: 'Overall, despite the recent cut in interest rates, there is little demand for funds from the corporate sector, which seems to be obtaining any necessary funding from a combination of improved profitability and continued use of the capital markets.' The weakness of the lending figures was offset by other money supply figures yesterday. The annual growth in the whole of M4, the broadest measure of the money supply, was 5.9 per cent, up from 5.6 per cent in January. The monthly rise between January and February was 0.9 per cent, which was above analysts' expectations. M4 has been accelerating in recent months and the annualised growth rate over the three months to February was 6.8 per cent. The government's monitoring range is 3 per cent to 9 per cent. Mr Adrian Cooper, UK economist at James Capel, said that January's strong growth in M4 was due to special factors, particularly a large public sector borrowing requirement which was not fully funded by gilts issues.

			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Markets: A green-backed bear - Global Investor International markets face a serious test of confidence this week: the dollar crisis shows no signs of abating and it has now pushed US long bond yields, which set the pace for global markets, very close to the top of their recent trading range. A significant downward break-out would send fresh shock waves through fixed income and equity markets around the world. The weekend resignation of Japanese Prime Minister Hata has hardly helped market stability. The political turmoil in Tokyo is likely to intensify pressure on the dollar this morning, with traders arguing that it will make a US-Japanese trade agreement much harder to achieve. This in turn increases the likelihood of further rounds of concerted central bank intervention to stabilise the dollar, but there is little reason to think this will prove any more successful than Friday's Canute-like failure to stem the tide running against the US currency. Whatever the cause of the dollar's weakness (inflation worries, the US trade deficit, distrust of President Clinton), the central message of the market is that the US does not offer nearly large enough a risk premium to encourage foreign investors to hold American assets. The markets suspect this will force the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy again, either at the next meeting of its policy-making committee, on July 5 and 6, or even before then. Irrespective of currency factors, the robust (though slowing) American economic expansion probably justifies another quarter point rise in the Fed Funds rate some time over the summer, but gradualism of that order will hardly encourage investors to hold dollars, while a sharp rise in rates would risk damaging the economic recovery. Last week's sharp drop in bond and equity prices has already factored some tightening into the US market, but that may not prevent further market instability if the Fed does act. The low rate of US inflation may give some underpinning to the bond market. Although Wall Street has been focusing anxious attention on the recent sharp increases in commodity price indices, the fact is that labour costs are a far more important component of output and they appear to still be well under control. The equity market, however, looks more vulnerable. Since the Fed first tightened in early February, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has been relatively robust, losing less than 10 per cent of its value at the worst point and trading in a drifting, sideways range. There has, however, been a slight downward bias to the movement and last week's near 140-point drop brings the average near the bottom of its post-tightening trading range. Until now, investors have bought on the dips and private individuals have continued to be net investors in stock mutual funds. However, mutual fund cash inflows dropped last week to their lowest level since early April, when the market suffered its only week of net redemptions this year, and further dollar problems will only increase the private investor's edginess. If the Dow dips through 3,600, it could trigger a sharp drop in US equities over the coming few weeks, with an inevitable ripple effect around the world. The US market correction of the past five months has yet to produce the kind of sharp downward lunge, the final submission to the bear, which often marks a turning point. Unless the dollar bounces, one could be coming. Mexico Emerging markets will take their lead this week from Wall Street, but Mexico could face additional volatility following Friday's resignation of interior minister, Mr Jorge Carpizo McGregor, even though this was rejected by President Salinas, who will try and twist Carpizo's arm this week. Carpizo is the man responsible for Mexico's August 21 presidential election and his departure, complaining that 'diverse sectors' are trying to block his efforts for fair poll, are bound to throw fresh doubts on the validity of the country's electoral processes. Some analysts suspect his resignation may be linked to that of Mr Manuel Camacho Solis, who last week stood down as the government's peace envoy to Zapatist rebels after criticism from ruling PRI presidential candidate Mr Ernesto Zedillo. The implication is that Camacho allies (who may include Carpizo) will not support Zedillo's campaign. The resignation increases the perception of political risk in Mexico. The IPC index fell 55.66 after Friday's news and is down 16 per cent on the year. Mr Geoffrey Dennis of Bear Stearns says the country is suffering from a 'buyers' strike', with investors seeing little reason to buy. He thinks the country remains a long-term buy but does not rule out further short-term weakness. General Motors This week General Motors is expected to announce its first big shake-up in senior management since the autumn of 1992, when the board ousted Mr Robert Stempel and replaced him as chief executive with Mr Jack Smith. Mr Smith will remain chief executive but hand over responsibility for GM's North American vehicle operations to young turk Mr Rick Wagoner. The handover is a measure of how far Mr Smith has turned round GM's North American operations. In the first quarter they were more than Dollars 500m in the black, thanks to, in part, an improving market, which has allowed all US car manufacturers to cut sales discounts. But the distance GM still has to go was underlined by a report last week from consultancy Harbour &amp; Associates, which estimates it would have to cut 20,000 jobs to become as efficient as Ford. GM shares trade on a 1994 p/e ratio of a mere 7.3 and many Wall Street analysts rate it a buy, given its restructuring and the strong cyclical upturn in North American vehicle sales. But GM still has much to prove, the market will soon start focusing on the next cyclical downturn (if it has not already done so), and a very jittery equity market means this is not the time to be increasing exposure to US consumer durable stocks.  ---------------------------------------------------------------            TOTAL RETURN IN LOCAL CURRENCY TO 2/6/94  ---------------------------------------------------------------                             % change over period                 US    Japan    Germany    France    Italy   UK  --------------------------------------------------------------- Cash  --------------------------------------------------------------- Week          0.08     0.04     0.09       0.10     0.14    0.09 Month         0.36     0.18     0.44       0.48     0.63    0.42 Year          3.75     3.22     6.56       6.19     9.50    5.81  --------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 3-5 year  --------------------------------------------------------------- Week         -0.14    -0.50     0.19       0.29     0.22    0.34 Month         0.63    -1.49    -0.59      -1.58    -3.32   -0.98 Year          0.51     5.33     5.60       3.67    10.70    3.59  --------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 7-10 year  --------------------------------------------------------------- Week         -0.15    -0.91     1.17       0.74     1.89    0.46 Month         0.89    -3.00    -0.91      -3.66    -5.09   -2.15 Year         -1.45     6.70     3.84       1.02    12.10    1.59  --------------------------------------------------------------- Equities  --------------------------------------------------------------- Week          -2.6     -1.1     -1.0       -0.7      2.1    -2.7 Month         -0.5      1.3     -9.2       -9.9     -6.7    -5.3 Year           4.1      9.3     19.0        6.8     31.0     5.9  --------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Cash &amp; Bonds - Lehman Brothers.

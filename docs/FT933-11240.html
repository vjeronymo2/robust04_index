			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Management: A revised flight plan - BA's new plant, opening today, has a Japanese feel At a bleak airport overlooking the Bristol Channel, British Airways is launching an adventurous attempt to transfer Japanese ideas on the management of manufacturing to a maintenance operation. The airline has built a Pounds 70m maintenance hangar on a greenfield site at Cardiff airport in south Wales. Officially opened today, British Airways Maintenance Cardiff (BMAC) is devoted to looking after Boeing 747 aircraft, BA's most important model which flies on money-spinning, long-haul routes. The project was earmarked from the start as a testbed for management ideas that might be extended to other parts of the company. 'We set out quite deliberately to emulate other greenfield sites: to go back to basics and structure the working relations and the shop floor ideally,' says Alistair Cumming, chairman of BMAC, BA's director of engineering and a member of its executive board of management. South Wales seemed suitable because the local population is familiar with the Japanese management style in local factories owned by Sony, Hitachi and Panasonic. The results of the strategy are a striking piece of architecture in which offices and hangar are naturally lit, and a long list of management ideas under test. The schemes new to BA include: Breaking down demarcations between mechanics, engineers and avionics experts as far as skills permit. The idea is encourage staff to be able to do each other's jobs as much as possible. Training programmes are designed to break down barriers further. Ensuring that all staff, from receptionists to managing director, spend at least one day in every quarter on the hangar floor working on aircraft. Creating a single union agreement with the AEEU, the general engineering union, outside BA's existing multi-union arrangements; the wage bill is more than 20 per cent lower than it would have been at London's Heathrow airport for similarly qualified staff. Subcontracting all non-core work such as security, catering, plant maintenance and cleaning. Describing staff as 'company members' not 'employees'. Insisting that all staff, including executives, clock in and wear identical white boiler suits. Equipping all grades of office with identical furniture. Building a single canteen for all staff and eliminating reserved car parking spaces. The company has also tried to instil a culture of cleanliness: office cleaners work during the day rather than when staff have gone home. All tools are 'shadowboarded', that is, a cardboard cutout is uncovered when a tool is taken from its storage box. This reduces the risk that a tool might be stolen or left inside an aircraft. BMAC was careful in who it chose to work at the plant. It was wary of mechanics accustomed to sloppy work in local car repair garages and wanted people who already had a flexible approach to their work, says Alan McDonald, general manager. Half the 340 staff recruited so far have never worked on aircraft and only 31 came from elsewhere in BA. Staff numbers will eventually rise to about 1,000, to cope with BA's new 747s which otherwise would have been maintained by subcontractors, probably in East Asia. The test of whether BMAC can compete with these rivals will come when the third and final 747 maintenance bay opens in a year's time. BA does not need the extra space and BMAC will try to sell its services to other airlines. But by then the low-cost base strategy will have advanced another notch. Today, only one in five employees is in support and administration. Next year it will be one in six.</p>

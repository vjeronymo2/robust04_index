			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets: Istanbul pauses after record-breaking performance - Robust economic growth and planned share issues provide the incentive The Istanbul stock exchange has been outperforming other emerging markets for much of 1993. Continued robust economic growth, coupled with signs that companies are preparing to float new stock, has pushed the market to new heights. With just 146 companies listed, the index closed 3.4 per cent up on Friday at 8,375, the last day of trading before a week-long holiday. In the IFC index of emerging markets, Turkey is the clear leader, showing a gain of 79 per cent in dollar terms since the start of the year. However, following Mr Suleyman Demirel's election as president earlier this month, after the death in April of President Turgut Ozal, and with the centre-right True Path party (DYP) due to choose a new leader to head the coalition government at a special congress on June 13, brokers anticipate a spate of profit-taking before the market settles at new levels. On the economic front, one worry is inflation: after hitting 4.4 per cent in April, the monthly figure is expected to rise further in May to between 6 and 7 per cent after a series of price increases in government-controlled monopolies of petrol, tea and aluminium. External support for the Turkish reform effort has also been dampened by the decision of Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit agency, to downgrade Turkey's rating to BBB minus. For all that, figures on industrial production suggest that the economy will equal, if not better, last year's 5.9 per cent growth rate, higher than any other country in the OECD. Moreover, interest rates have come down, encouraging new investment and helping to reduce the high levels of liquidity suffered by the banking sector. In a further sign of market confidence, the government's privatisation agency, the Public Participation Administration, which handles state sales to the public, has been offloading stock. Brokers confirm that the PPA has been a seller of Tofas, the Fiat local car assembly company, 22 per cent of which is due to be sold by public offering later this year. The PPA was also a seller of Netas, the telephone equipment manufacturer now 51 per cent-owned by Northern Telecom, of Canada. The PPA was taking advantage of increased public demand for the stock, which is currently trading at around twice the issue price when the PPA floated a 20 per cent stake in March. Output of both cars and cement, two of the favoured sectors, continues to grow. Otosan, the local Ford collaboration producing a range of commercial vehicles, reported production up sharply in April - a good indicator of general economic activity. Cement companies such as those at Mardin and Adana, in Turkey's south east, are attracting interest in anticipation of construction demand on both the new Birecik dam and the irrigation network for the vast south-east Anatolian Project. Brokers report some profit-taking in Ege, the beer stock, currently on a p/e ratio of 22 times earnings compared with a market average of 7 times. What is more encouraging is that, at last, brokers discern a pick-up in the pace of new issues, vital if the market is to sustain these heights. For example, Aktas, an electricity utility in Istanbul, has recently announced plans to float stock, while the local Lee Cooper subsidiary is also considering an initial public offering. With interest rates falling, government paper, hitherto the main attraction for investors, has lost some of its allure, and banks, the largest buyers, are switching into equities. Such was the lack of interest that last week's Treasury bill auction was cancelled. The new portfolio strategy has been driven by legislative changes, encouraging banks and trading houses to switch funds into equities. Under the reforms, introduced last December, long term investment funds, with at least 25 per cent of their portfolio in equities, will only have to pay a 10 per cent withholding tax. For companies setting up new funds, investment income is tax deductible. Koc, Turkey's largest company involved in car assembly with Fiat, and the dominant player in consumer electronics and retail gas markets, has launched three new funds, each with a portfolio of TL500bn (Dollars 49m). Brokers estimate that TL10,000bn is currently under fund management by various institutions in Turkey. If just a quarter of that is attracted to the stock exchange, the effect could be dramatic.</p>

			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL ELECTION / DOWNEY MUNICIPAL COURT;  </P> <P> ILLEGITIMATE SON CLAIMS VICTORY IN FATHER'S DEFEAT  </P> <P> A candidate for Downey Municipal Court judge whose illegitimate son campaigned  against him was defeated in Tuesday's election.  </P> <P> Observers, however, were unable to agree on whether Leo R. Villa's son was  instrumental in causing Villa's loss Tuesday to trial lawyer David W. Perkins.  </P> <P> Leo Villa, a 62-year-old part-time court commissioner and retired deputy  district attorney, was the target of a campaign waged by his son, Richard L.  Villa, who was born out of wedlock 34 years ago. Richard Villa said he was  angry because his father has seen him only twice and barely acknowledges his  existence. Three weeks ago he took to the streets of Downey, Norwalk and La  Mirada, posting more than 400 campaign signs that read, "Leo R. Villa's son  says vote no on Villa."  </P> <P> Richard Villa attributed his father's defeat to his campaign. He said, "(It)  looks like voters are looking at morals as an issue when electing a judge, and  my campaign was effective."  </P> <P> But Perkins downplayed any effect Richard Villa's campaign might have had on  the race. "I don't think it (the campaign) had that much to do with the final  result . . . . My perception is that I would have won anyway. If I am going to  win, I win because of my record." Perkins added that he was not involved with  Richard Villa's campaign.  </P> <P> Perkins said voters based their decision on his experience in civil and  criminal law. Leo Villa's background is mainly in prosecution. "I think voters  wanted someone with a wider range of experience," Perkins said.  </P> <P> Leo Villa could not be reached for comment.  </P></p>

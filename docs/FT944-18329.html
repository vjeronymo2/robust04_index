			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Further disposals at Lucas Industries The streamlining of Lucas Industries will continue with the sale of Lucas Management Systems, a software business, and the possible sale of Lucas Engineering &amp; Systems, a consultancy specialising in manufacturing systems. The disposals continue a line of divestments dating back to 1992 but come in immediate response to a review of the Lucas business which was undertaken by Mr George Simpson, chief executive since last April. That review, Lucas noted yesterday, had concluded that resources should be increasingly directed at the group's automotive and aerospace interests, and further divestments were in prospect. 'We cannot have so many irons in the fire. There must be a focusing down to the real core businesses within Lucas,' Mr Simpson said in August. The two companies up for sale are part of the group's old applied technology division, now increasingly concentrated on the manufacture of electronic products. Management Systems is based at Slough, following extensive cutbacks in 1992-93. It has annual sales of about Pounds 45m and employs 800 people. Engineering &amp; Systems, whose business is based on sales within the Lucas group, has turnover of about Pounds 20m and a staff of 400. Lucas would not say whether the companies were profitable.</p>

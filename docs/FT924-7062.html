			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / International Company News: Flaws found in Spain's bid rules A BITTER fight for control of a small Spanish property group, El Encinar de los Reyes, has exposed serious flaws in the country's new takeover rules and, according to some foreign investment bankers, threatens the authority of the Spanish stock market regulator, the Comision Nacional del Mercado de Valores (CNMV). As the bidding war between the family controlling El Encinar and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV), Spain's second largest bank, intensifies, foreign investor attention is focusing on the CNMV's role in the dispute. 'What is happening here is enormously important; we have a set of takeover rules and the BBV is ignoring them and being allowed to get away with it,' said one UK investment banker yest-erday. The Olazabal family that controls 35 per cent of El Encinar - owner of a large residential development outside Madrid - launched a formal public offer for a further 14 per cent of the company last month for Pta2,500 (Dollars 22) a share. This would give them majority control of El Encinar as the target company owns 3 per cent of itself in Treasury stock. Under takeover rules published in June 1991 a competing bid by BBV - which built up a stake of 24.9 per cent in El Encinar earlier this year  - should have been formally registered with the CNMV, together with a pricing prospectus. Instead, BBV ran a series of press advertisements urging El Encinar shareholders to reject the Olazabal offer on the understanding that the bank would make an improved offer once the bid from the Olazabal had expired. BBV said its offer would be clearly superior to the Olazabal's but never said by how much. Spanish takeover rules say a competing bid must be registered within 20 days of the original, leaving the first bidder time to respond within the maximum two months allowed for share offerings. It is being claimed that the bank's tactic, which one Olazabal adviser described as 'inventing a parallel takeover market', has thrown the original offer off course. The Olazabal family raised their offer to Pta2,750 a share and BBV replied it would better that. The Olazabal's yesterday offered another Pta20 but complain that while BBV is simply allowed to sit back and promise more without saying how much more, they are being forced to fight in the dark. 'What kind of rules do we have after this, what kind of advice can I give a foreign company seeking an acquisition here?,' complained one Spanish investment banker who asked not to be named. BBV claims that it has not broken any rules. 'The CNMV has to decide whether what we have done is right or wrong and so far it has said nothing to us,' said the bank. An official at the CNMV admitted that 'a new (takeover) channel appears to have been opened' by BBV. 'If we had seen any illegality we would have done something about it'. The CNMV says there is nothing in the takeover code to prevent successive informal offers such as BBV's. Critics say that this attitude severely compromises the CNMV's position as a regulator and that in a transparent market, the written rules must be the only guide to what can be done. Advisers for the Olazabal family are pressing the CNMV to take a formal position and are threatening to test the BBV bid in court.</p>

They are escaping from North Korea,  individually or in family groups, to take refuge in China.  Sometimes the number of escapees reaches dozens per day. They  cross the border suffering from unbearable hunger, and they seek  freedom. In China, however, they do not find the freedom they  sought or even a comfortable place to rest. Most of them are  captured, taken back to North Korea, and executed. Reporter Pak  Son-kyu of the mobile news coverage department has this report:    [Male escapee] I escaped to China about two months ago.  Hiding in the daytime, I came to an area near the border to  determine when the guard change took place. I decided that 0630  would be the most suitable time for my escape and crossed the  Yalu River by way of Huchang.    [Reporter Pak Son-kyu] Desiring freedom and food, they flee,  risking their lives. The area you see behind me is Tumen in  Yanbian. Further in the distance is Namyang in North Korea.  The escapees from North Korea find their way into China via  border towns like Tumen. The number of escapees living  scattered in various areas of China is reported to be around  2,000. In Dalian, a port area, some 800 of them are living in  hiding. A considerable number of them are living scattered  about northeastern China in such places as Yanji, Hunchun, and  Dandong, according to the escapees and the residents of these  areas.    Escapees began coming to China about 10 years ago. Their  numbers started to increase some three years ago, and beginning  last October, the influx became even heavier, with  representation from more walks of life, the residents say.    [Unidentified Tumen resident] Many are coming. When the  Tumen River is frozen, the escapees come in family groups.  There are senior cadre members among them.    [Reporter Pak] How are the escapees living in China? This  shabby office room on the outskirts of Yanji is where two  escapees lived in hiding until recently. The owner of this  office, who gave them a hiding place at the risk of banishment,  had to put them out recently.    [Office owner] I urged them to learn Chinese, but it was not  easy for them. Therefore, people could easily tell they were  from North Korea. So they had to leave. If they could stay  without being noticed by the neighbors, they would not have to  leave. But since this was not possible, they were restless and  I was restless.    [Reporter Pak] So they had to leave here after all, and no  one knows their whereabouts. Most of the escapees would prefer  to seek asylum in the ROK or a third country rather than to live  in China, which is ready to arrest them and hand them over to  North Korea, under an agreement with that country, instead of  protecting them. The escapees seek assistance from the ROK  Embassy through various channels, but few manage to get help.    [Unidentified escapee] When we visited the ROK Embassy, we  were certain that they would receive us with compatriotic love.  But the reality was to the contrary. We do not think them cold  -- they may be bound by some limitations.    [Reporter Pak] The reason the ROK Government is not actively  dealing with this problem is that it wants to avoid adverse  effects on inter-Korean relations and adverse influences on our  relations with the Chinese Government. For this reason, the  escapees have to live in hiding in China. However, under the  watchful eye of the Chinese public security authorities, they  find it very difficult to find a place to live in seclusion.    The reason for this is that North Korean nationals living in  China, commonly called chogyo, are making desperate efforts to  find them. There are some 2,000 chogyo in the Yanbian area  alone.    [Male escapee] There is a chogyo committee in Yanji. There  are many of them in various places in China. There is one in  every town, including Heilongjiang. The escapees are arrested  because of chogyos. Many a poor compatriot was arrested in  China and taken away because of these chaps.    [Reporter Pak] For this reason, the escapees, not knowing  what to do, are in imminent danger. In this process, many of  them are arrested and taken away.    [Unidentified North Korean residing in China] We have heard  that many of them have been arrested.    [Unidentified witness] I saw a woman being taken away. She  resisted so hard that most of her hair was pulled from her  scalp. She said that she would rather die than be taken back to  North Korea. Although she would be killed in North Korea  anyway, she would rather die right there in China than in North  Korea. She was very tough.    [Reporter Pak] Because they know how painful it would be to  be taken away and cruelly executed in North Korea, the escapees  feel all the more miserable.    [Unidentified escapee] This is rat poison. I would much  rather kill myself than be arrested.    [Reporter Pak] Taking advantage of the escapees' urgent  plight, there are criminal gangs that use them to smuggle goods  in exchange for providing a hiding place for them. There are  also impostors who cheat the escapees out of their money.    [Unidentified escapee] I can hardly sustain myself in China  any longer. They cheated me out of 3,500 won. I got this money  with the help of an ROK man. The impostor cheated me, saying he  would give me a permit to reside in China.    [Reporter Pak] In some port areas, like Dalian, there are  organizations that let escapees board ocean-going vessels to  travel overseas. For this, they charge 10,000 Chinese yuan,  about 1 million ROK won.    Some Chinese residents and Korean residents in China extend  a  helping hand to them out of compassion, but the risk is too  great for them to do so as much as they wish.    [Reporter Pak] I am now standing on the Tumen River which  forms the border between China and North Korea. As you see, the  entire river is frozen hard. Only 20 percent of those who  attempt to escape succeed. The remaining 80 percent are  captured and executed, the escapees testify. Some 2,000  escapees will have to live in endless, cautious seclusion even  if they cross the border. And others are waiting for an  opportunity, which may or may not come, to cross the border for  freedom and food. Will there be no humanitarian measures to  relieve them of their pain?

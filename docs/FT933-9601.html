			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Letter: Changes, yes - but no 'demise' of The Engineer Sir, Rumours of the 'virtual demise' of The Engineer (Letters, July 28) are not merely exaggerated - they fly in the face of the facts. Important changes are indeed afoot at The Engineer. We are making them in response to a change in manufacturing as industry recovers from recession, leaner, fitter and more commercially aware than ever before. Mr Gibson asserts in his letter that engineering is a dynamic business which needs publications with real authority. Quite so. The Engineer has achieved that authority by evolving to keep pace with the industry it has served throughout its 137-year his-tory. The latest developments to be unveiled this September are geared to help engineers meet the challenges of today's and tomorrow's manufacturing environment. There will be a stronger editorial focus on manufacturing-specific, job-useful information, particularly in feature articles. Our popular new technology section will be joined by a highly selective new product section, and we will reinstate a reader inquiry service. What will not change is our emphasis on hard, interpretative news, underlined by a new editorial design. With this kind of investment in The Engineer, it should be easy to conclude that we are committed to keeping the stream of information to industry constantly on tap.

			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MAYOR UNDER FIRE;  </P> <P> THE BRADLEY PROBES: STILL NOT OVER  </P> <P> City Atty. James K. Hahn filed a civil lawsuit on Wednesday, charging Mayor Tom  Bradley with failing to meet financial disclosure requirements, but said he  would not file criminal charges against the mayor.  </P> <P>  Release of Hahn's report completed a six-month investigation of the mayor's  connections with Far East National Bank and Valley Federal Savings and Loan  Assn.; the Task Force for Africa/Los Angeles Relations, and Bradley's personal  investments through the investment firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert.  </P> <P>  But Hahn's report does not conclude the investigation of Bradley's personal  finances and conduct. The following are still pending:  </P> <P>  The City Clerk is attempting to identify and reconcile all campaign  contributions to Bradley's most recent campaign fund for possible violation of  the city's limits on donation amounts.  </P> <P> The City Controller is reviewing the city treasurer's office transactions with  Far East National Bank and auditing possible misuse of city funds by the  "sister cities" program headed by Bradley associate Juanita St. John.  </P> <P> Various City Council committees continue to conduct inquires into the mayor's  ties to two financial institutions and the Task Force for Africa/Los Angeles  Relations.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Police Department is investigating whether funds from the Task  Force for Africa/Los Angeles Relations were illegally transferred into the  accounts of a real estate investment in which Bradley and Juanita St. John were  among the partners. THe LAPD also is looking into actions by officials in the  treasurer's office seeking to cover up Bradley's connection to a $2-million  city deposit into Far East National Bank.  </P> <P> The Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Department of Justice-Public  Integrity Section and the Securities and Exchange Commission are focusing on  the mayor's relationship with Drexel Burnham Lambert examining possible insider  trading violations in his stock dealings.  </P> <P> The State attorney's general's office is tentatively planning to conduct an  audit of the Africa Task Force.  </P> <P>  In addition to the Hahn inquiry, the following investigations are concluded:  </P> <P>  An audit by the city controller of the Task Force for Africa/City Relations  concluded that Juanita St. John owes the city $260,714 in missing taxpayer  funds, including $180,000 in unaccounted funds. A second audit of the city  clerk's office, which has responsibility for authorizing payments to such  groups as the Africa Task Force, was found to have inadequate procedures along  with several other areas of weakness.  </P> <P> The City Council's Governmental Operations Committee conducted three hearings,  which sought to learn the focus, methods and progress of the city attorney's  investigation.  </P> <P> The Federal Urban Mass Transit Agency conducted a review of its transactions  with the city, which were processed through a non-interest-bearing account at  Far East National bank. The review concluded that proper procedures were not  followed by the bank and city. But UMTA decided not to require the city to pay  it the estimated $12,000 in lost interest.  </P></p>

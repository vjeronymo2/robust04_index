			<p>920626 FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (10): An all-round advantage - The prospects of Haryana, the north's only Congress-ruled state THE ONLY Congress-ruled state in the northern Indian Hindi-speaking belt, Haryana has ambitious plans for economic development. Mr Bhajan Lal, its controversial chief minister, won the state a year ago when Mr Devi Lal, the former deputy prime minister, and his party, the Janata Dal, were trounced. Because of the Congress victory in Haryana, while the party was routed all over northern India, the state's officials expect preferential treatment for its economic development plans. These are no longer confined to agricultural growth, although it is readily conceded that Haryana is primarily an agrarian state where food grain production has made rapid strides. Haryana contributes to the national food grain stocks far more than larger states because it was one of the states where the green revolution succeeded. But Haryana has ambitions to be an industrial state as well. Earlier this year, Mr Bhajan Lal released a statement on its industrial policy which laid great emphasis on industrialisation as employment in agriculture had reached saturation point. Haryana encircles the union territory of Delhi and Mr Lal thinks that this is the state's biggest advantage in its drive towards industrialisation. Indeed, one of the objectives of the statement on industrial policy is to exploit the state's 'strategic advantage' of proximity to New Delhi, which officials believe to be the gateway to foreign markets. For this reason that the state aims to attract export-oriented, high-tech and electronics industries. Indeed, Haryana's industrial belt is like a noose round the capital. Most of the major industries are located in towns on New Delhi's border, such as Faridabad and Gurgaon, or a short distance away. This has already created problems of overcrowding and pollution, which the state's officials do not accept though, even in a small state like Haryana, there are schemes for 'balanced regional development'. These give incentives to companies to start industries in districts that have none. The 'so-called' backward areas of Haryana provide incentives such as a capital investment subsidy worth 15 per cent of the total, subject to a maximum of Rs1.5m, but so far there have been no takers. Industries are still drawn to areas lying in Delhi's periphery even though land prices are high and congestion is creating problems such as electricity shortages and transport bottlenecks. What are known as 'pioneer' units will get subsidies if they come, varying from Rs5m to Rs1.5m and depending on size. To encourage them to go to 'backward' areas, these units will qualify for additional subsidies. These are available for agro-based and food processing industries at the attractive rate of 25 per cent of investment in fixed assets (subject to a maximum of Rs3m). Similar subsidies are available for electronics units. Officials say they have received many inquiries but it is still too early for investment decisions. Haryana has several industrial estates where small and 'tiny' units do a thriving business, although the driving force is the Haryana State Industrial Development Corporation, which plans to start five new estates in addition to small village ones to provide self-employment opportunities for the state's educated youth. The corporation has already arranged foreign collaboration, including a halogen auto-lamp project with South Korea, a disposal syringe project with technology from Britain and an automobile radiator project with Canadian help. The state's industrial policy, in fact, provides special incentives for investment by non-resident Indians and foreign firms, citing as successful examples Maruti Udyog, the country's largest car maker, and Escorts, a big manufacturer of tractors and motor cycles. Haryana's success in its plans for industrialisation do not depend entirely on political stability. The state has a tradition of political defection (Mr Bhajan Lal himself suffered through defections when Congress was in power six years ago). New public sector units will be limited by India's economic reforms and hoped-for handouts from the central government may not materialise. To industrialise, Haryana must attract private investment and proximity to Delhi is at present the only attraction it offers for this. Much will depend on how successfully it deals with providing an adequate infrastructure for industrialisation. Although the state boasts that every village has electricity, the claim is belied by erratic supply. Power supply cuts sometimes last several days in the peak harvest season. Many factories have learnt not to depend on the state electricity board and have installed expensive generating sets. The government recognises this and has provided subsidies for them. The state's roads are in an appalling state. Corruption is rampant and funds for road building are siphoned off by politicians, officials and contractors. Unfortunately, corruption is a way of life in Haryana; anything that is connected with officialdom moves only if it involves a bribe. Prospects in Haryana are not improved by its proximity to Punjab. Violence has already spilled across the state's borders and investors hesitate to start businesses in areas close to Punjab which the government wants to develop. Fortunately, Haryana does not have a serious communal problem. It does, however, have a caste problem, with a bewildering array of castes and sub-castes that have their interests, rather than the state's, uppermost in their minds. Caste is all-pervasive and makes inroads into politics and officialdom and is responsible for vendettas that are the bane of life in Haryana. It is intangibles like this, as are concrete factors like power shortages, that Haryana must tackle to be on the road to successful economic development.</p>

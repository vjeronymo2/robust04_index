			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Super-regulator woos banks PLACES will be reserved for banks and building societies on the board of a proposed new super-regulator for retail financial services, in a move intended to encourage banks to participate in a body they say they do not wish to join. Sources familiar with a consultative document on the new self-regulatory body, to be known as the Private Investment Authority, said it left room for up to 30 members on its board of directors. Of those, 10 to 12 would be 'product providers' such as life insurers and unit trust companies. Should the banks become members, some of the seats will be allocated to their representatives. Six or seven of the remaining seats will be reserved for public-interest members such as consumer representatives, lawyers and accountants. The retail financial services arms of the big banks are mostly regulated directly by the Securities and Investments Board. Persuading them to switch to membership in the PIA is considered critical to its success. The large life insurers have said they will not participate unless the banks become members as well. Members of the PIA formation committee, headed by Sir Brian Hayes, have sought meetings with the Treasury and the Bank of England to urge them to promote membership among banks and others.</p>

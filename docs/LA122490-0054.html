			<p><P> December 24, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THORN IN THEIR SIDES: STATIONS AT ODDS OVER PARADE;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: KTLA SAYS KTTV'S 'COMMERCIAL-FREE BROADCAST' CLAIM IS BUNK. KTTV  INSISTS THAT ITS 'INFORMAL' MENTIONS OF SPONSORS DO NOT CONSTITUTE A  COMMERCIAL.  </P> <P> The Tournament of Roses Parade has provoked a stink between two local TV  stations that will broadcast the event live on New Year's Day. What smells,  according to KTLA Channel 5, is KTTV Channel 11's claim that it will air the  annual pageant "without any commercials whatsoever."  </P> <P> KTTV's parade broadcast will be sponsored by several major corporations that  will pay to be mentioned and thanked at the beginning and end of the 2 1/2-hour  program, said Don Tillman, KTTV's vice president of programming.  </P> <P> The dispute is one of semantics over what will happen every half hour in  between. Tillman conceded that four times during the course of the parade, the  Channel 11 hosts will explain that viewers are seeing the parade without  commercial interruptions because of the cooperation of the sponsors -- who will  be named.  </P> <P> "It will be very informal," he said. "They might say, 'And if you are enjoying  the telecast, you might want to drop them a note.' "  </P> <P> Tillman said that there will be no visual identification of the sponsors  superimposed on the screen over the parade scene, as the station has done in  the past. KTLA also uses that approach, superimposing the logos of its sponsors  over the picture while the hosts read a brief ad.  </P> <P> Tillman insisted that KTTV's "informal" mentions of the sponsors do not  constitute a commercial.  </P> <P> Channel 5 thinks otherwise. "It's very deceptive and misleading," said Ed  Harrison, KTLA's spokesman. "These sponsors are still paying for that mention.  It is an advertisement. True, it may not be a traditional commercial that we  are all used to seeing. It's not a hard sell, but it is a paid corporate  endorsement. If they say there's going to be absolutely no commercials, then  they should be fair about it and not have any commercials. This is just another  one of their gimmicks."  </P> <P> Tillman, whose station broadcast the parade in 3-D two years ago, would not say  how much the sponsors are paying to be a part of KTTV's coverage. But when  asked if the station would lose any money, he replied: "I certainly hope not.  That's not what I'm here for.  </P> <P> "The sad part about this whole thing," Tillman added, "is that this is  something that is a real sincere gesture to our viewers and a real good-faith  effort on the part of our sponsors, and our competitor is trying to make it  look like something that is evil and ugly."  </P> <P> KTLA is also miffed about one of KTTV's promos for its so-called  "commercial-free" broadcast that purports to show what the parade telecast  looks like on other stations. A sign emblazoned with a big fish advertising  "Fishman's Fish Market" is then flashed on the screen, blocking the view of the  parade in the background. Hal Fishman, of course, is KTLA's news anchor.  </P> <P> "It's pretty funny," said KTLA's Harrison. "But it is a cheap shot, and even  worse, it's inaccurate. We don't block any part of the parade. The visual logos  are shown very discreetly on the bottom third of the screen. They don't  interrupt anything."  </P> <P> The Rose Parade will also be telecast live beginning at 8 a.m. on Channels 2, 4  and 7 and on Spanish-language station KMEX Channel 34.  </P> <P> Last year, KTLA clobbered KTTV and all other stations in parade ratings,  grabbing about 1.1 million households in the Los Angeles area and 46% of all  those watching television at the time. That was more than the combined audience  of KTTV and the other four local stations broadcasting the parade.  </P></p>

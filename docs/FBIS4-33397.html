			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Hugo Sergio del Aguila] </F>   [Text] Caracas, 2 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Venezuelan President  Rafael Caldera will ask his colleagues, who will participate in  the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, to seek urgent solutions for  the demands of millions of poor people in the region, Foreign  Minister Miguel Angel Burelli said today.    The Venezuelan foreign minister said the Ibero-American  Summit will be a good opportunity to find solutions "for social  disorders and urban overcrowding," which have become common and  serious problems for Latin America and the Caribbean. "Latin  America and the Caribbean have common problems such as poverty,  social disorders, and overcrowded cities because of people  moving in from the countryside and becoming disorderly masses,"  Burelli said.    In an interview with NOTIMEX, the foreign minister said  Venezuela regrets to see that the development of the last few  decades has not kept man as its center of attention with his  various needs, such as education, health, food, and housing.    He confirmed that President Caldera will participate in the  summit in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, on 14 and 15 June,  which will be attended by 21 heads of state and government,  including Spain and Portugal, because "Venezuela will fulfill  its obligation once again." It will be Caldera's first trip  abroad since he was sworn in on 2 February.    According to the Venezuelan foreign minister, Ibero-American  summits are of great importance far beyond their agenda points,  because of the opportunities they represent and because they  provide a greater awareness of reality. "The Ibero-American  Summit will also be a good opportunity--without ruling out other  forums such as the OAS--to clearly establish the desire to give  greater importance to human development," Burelli said.    The minister said work is still being done on the summit's  agenda, but noted that, in addition to the discussion of social  problems, it is necessary to discuss "the Haitian tragedy, one  of the most difficult topics because of its lack of solutions."    He said it is important to "exchange ideas" about the Summit  of the Americas convened by U.S. President William Clinton for  Miami, Florida to which all countries of the hemisphere have  been invited, except Cuba. According to Burelli, the Miami  meeting will be an opportunity for Latin America to talk to the  United States about topics of extreme importance to the region.    Venezuela will reiterate at the forum the proposal it made  during the recent Rio Group Summit in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on the  urgent need to create an instrument to fight corruption, such as  drug trafficking, in a drastic and expeditious manner. The  foreign minister explained that the Venezuelan proposal  coincides with a law being drafted by the Ecuadoran Government  to curb influence-peddling and corruption. "We seek to merge  both initiatives so as to propose an agile and useful instrument  to stop the wave of corruption in our countries," he said.  Burelli said we must take advantage of the Ibero-American  Summit and other forums to insist on this serious problem  because democracy "must involve proven honesty."    As for the topic of continental security, the foreign  minister pointed out that, in view of the failure of the  Inter-American Security System, which was dismantled following  the Islas Malvinas War [Falkland Islands War], a mechanism to  detect elements of destabilization and insecurity in the region  is necessary. "There are sufficient reasons to undertake an  Ibero-American action on the security issue. Some of these  reasons include drug trafficking, guerrillas, extreme poverty,  human rights violations, hunger, and injustice," he said.    According to Burelli, the agenda for the Ibero-American  Summit will include topics such as culture, education, and the  exchange of technology as a mechanism to free ourselves from our  dependence on huge industrial centers. "We are going to seek  mechanisms that can allow universities and industries at a  hemispheric level to make innovations that can contribute to the  reduction of the high costs of social development," Burelli said.    The minister reiterated the importance of the so-called  Group  of Three's (Mexico, Colombia, and Venezuela) signing an  agreement to create a free trade zone, which is to take place in  Cartagena de Indias on 13 June. Burelli said the trade  agreement, which will open up a market of 245 million potential  consumers with a gross regional product of $370 billion, will  greatly contribute to the regional integration process and will  promote the economic development of the region.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Claudiu Harceaga: "Good-bye Hope! At a Meeting </F> With Heads of Other States, Ion Iliescu Introduces Adrian  Nastase as the Future President of Romania"]    [Text] We have learned through foreign diplomatic channels  and from well-documented and verified sources that Ion Iliescu,  at various meetings held with leaders or prime ministers of  other countries, is introducing Adrian Nastase [president of the  Chamber of Deputies of the Romanian parliament and leader of the  ruling Social Democracy Party of Romania, PDSR] as the future  president of Romania. If Nastase is not present at the  respective meeting, the current president is recommending him to  foreign diplomats as the major partner for dialogue in his  absence and the person who will accomplish the reform and the  current political orientation (which is basically a neocommunist  orientation!) of Romania. The respective situation should not  surprise us if we recall the behavior of the president of the  Chamber of Deputies in the past year: He blocked the  extraordinary session of the parliament in December 1993, has  come closer to the tough wing of the PDSR, and mainly,  repeatedly threatened that if the opposition continues to  support the idea that His Majesty Mihai I of Romania is the only  solution for pulling Romania out of crisis, the party that he  leads will institute a dictatorial regime.    Thus, after confiscating the revolution and after pushing  the  country into chaos and poverty, Ion Iliescu is not letting  things slide but is carefully preparing our future. Considering  that at the next general elections the current president of  Romania will not be able to run for office again, and that the  levers of a rule-of-law state (is it indeed a rule-of-law  state?) are in the hands of the ruling party, it is obvious that  the PDSR president must "graduate" on time from Ion Iliescu's  political school.</p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / International Company News: Privatised Austrian engineer ahead VA Technologie, the Austrian plant engineering group privatised and floated in May, has reported first-half net income of Sch286m (Dollars 26m), up 68 per cent year-on-year. Pre-tax profit was 50 per cent higher at Sch307m on sales of Sch10.2bn, up 40 per cent. New orders were 10 per cent ahead to Sch17.1bn and the order backlog at end-June stood at Sch56.8bn, 5 per cent higher. The group said the largest part of its turnover would be achieved in the second half, and forecast higher full-year profits. 'This will enable a shareholder-friendly dividend policy,' it said. The Austrian government sold 51 per cent of the shares in VA Tech, formerly part of the Austrian Industries combine, in May, raising Sch6.9bn.</p>

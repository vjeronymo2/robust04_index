			<p>BFN     [Text] The People's Assembly will resume its meetings today  under the chairmanship of the speaker, Dr. Fathi Surur. In last  night's session, the Assembly ratified the foreign currency  bill. Under the new law, all individuals and corporations will  be allowed to retain all their foreign currency earnings [rather  than convert it into Egyptian pounds].    Assembly members stressed that this law will boost  confidence  in the Egyptian economy, encourage foreign and domestic  investment, and stimulate the national economy.    Mahmud Muhammad Mahmud, minister of economy and foreign  trade, told the Assembly that the law will benefit both  importers and exporters. The minister added that the $16  billion that the Central Bank has in reserves measure the extent  of the success of the country's economic policy. There is an  oversupply of foreign exchange in Egypt and the new law will  help bring about a balance between the supply and demand for  foreign currency, Minister Mahmud stated.</p>

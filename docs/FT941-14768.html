			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Those other Ulster talks are on again: How attention is shifting to an internal political settlement With the UK-Irish peace initiative stalled, the delicate talks process aimed at securing an internal political settlement in Northern Ireland is poised to re-emerge from the shadows to which it has been consigned since November. The talks, co-ordinated by Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister, and involving Ulster's four main constitutional parties, have inevitably fallen out of the spotlight while it seemed the Downing Street declaration might persuade the IRA to renounce violence. But now that the government has concluded that the odds are against an early end to the 25-year republican campaign - clearing the way for Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, to enter the political process - this order of priorities is about to change. This was signalled last week when Mr Ancram began a new round of bilateral meetings, seeing a delegation from the largest party in the province, the Ulster Unionists. Yesterday he saw senior Alliance party members. Next week he is due to meet the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party. The message to republican leaders is clear. Their hesitancy over the joint declaration will not be allowed to delay efforts to piece together a political settlement. After yesterday's meeting Dr John Alderdice, leader of the Alliance party, added his voice to those calling for the government not to wait for Sinn Fein. Those familiar with the talks say the focus of the minister's efforts is to pin down an agenda that would permit participants to move on from the current time-consuming bilateral format - disparaged by some as 'blind-date politics' - to round-table discussions. It will not be easy. Ministers have said in the past that a resumption of round-table talks would be counter-productive until agreement is achievable. An earlier round-table talks process broke up without success in 1992. The hardline Democratic Unionist party has said it will not return to the talks process, bilateral or otherwise, until the meetings between Mr John Hume, the SDLP leader, and Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, end. Sinn Fein, as might be expected, is scathing about the exercise's prospects of success. Mr Tom Hartley, the party's national chairman, says: 'I don't think the dynamic for change can be found any more in those sorts of talks.' Mr Ancram is thought to have identified a certain amount of common ground on structures for devolved government in the province, including an 85-member Ulster assembly. But less headway has been made on 'strand two' of the talks  -how to handle relations between the province and the Irish Republic. Ulster Unionists are keen for efforts to be focused on setting this assembly up. But the SDLP is unlikely to consent to this without agreement on north/south relations, and on strand three - relations between the two governments. Mr Hume is said to have received assurances last week that the talks process would continue to embrace all three sets of relationships. But London is still waiting for a paper setting out Dublin's ideas on strands two and three which it requested last September.</p>

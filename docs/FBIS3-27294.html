			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, February 22 (XINHUA) -- The United  States today lodged a strong protest with Moscow over a Central  Intelligence Agency (CIA) officer's allegedly spying for the  former Soviet Union and later Russia since 1985.    Secretary of State Warren Christopher summoned Vladimir  Chkhikvishvili, charge d'affaires of the local Russian Embassy,  and registered "a formal diplomatic protest over circumstances"  surrounding the arrest of the former chief of the Soviet Branch  of the CIA's counter-intelligence group.    At the center of the latest diplomatic bickering is Aldrich  Hazen Ames, 52, who was arrested Monday by the Federal Bureau of  Investigations (FBI).    Christopher "protested the allegations of the Russian  intelligence service in engaging in the alleged espionage  activities at issue in this case," State Department Spokesman  Michael McCurry said in a statement.    Clinton has directed National Security Advisor W. Anthony  and  others to gauge the damages caused by ames' selling of the CIA's  vital operations and personnel information to Russia.    In Moscow, U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering also "raised  this  case with senior Russian officials," McCurry said.    A senior administration official was quoted as saying that  Moscow had been told to take responsibility for the case to  avoid damaging the U.S.-Russian relationships.    Washington was demanding that Russia recall their diplomats  involved or, the anonymous official said, the U.S. would "take  the actions ourselves."    During the past nine years until his arrest on Monday, the  Justice Department said, Ames and his 41-year-old wife Maia del  Rosario Casas received more than 1.5 million dollars from the  former Soviet Union's KGB and its Russian successor for giving  vital information on the CIA's operations and personnel.    If convicted, the couple could be sentenced a maximum of  life  imprisonment and 500,000 dollars in fines.    According to Helen F. Fahey, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern  District of Virginia, Ames also passed classified information  to, and received cash from, Russians through "dead drops" in the  Washington, D.C. area.    A "dead drop" is a prearranged location where a foreign  agent  drops off or picks up material from his contact.    It is not clear for the time being if any Russian diplomats  here would be pronounced as "persona non grata" as a result of  the couple's arrest.    When telephoned for comments on the U.S. protest, a duty  officer in the local Russian Embassy said nobody from the press  office was available today.    Attorney Fahey said in the complaint that Ames and his wife,  a native of Colombia and a naturalized U.S. citizen, used at  least two Swiss bank accounts to store and transfer the money  they got from the Russians.    The couple spent the money on, among other things, a 540,000  dollar house, Jaguar automobiles and more than 165,000 dollars  in stocks and securities.    FBI agents have seized the couple's residence in Arlington,  Virginia, and frozen numerous bank accounts belonging to or  controlled by the couple in the United States and abroad.    Ames' wife is a part-time student at Georgetown University  and previously acted as a paid source for the CIA in Mexico  City, Mexico.    "FBi Agents worked doggedly on this case -- not for months  but for years -- with the CIA's unwavering assistance every step  of the way," FBI Director Louis Freeh said.</p>

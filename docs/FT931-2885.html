			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / International Company News: Thomson lifts annual earnings 15% EARNINGS of Thomson Corp, the Canadian-owned travel and publishing group, rose by 15 per cent last year before taking into account previously-announced charges against its UK and North Amer-ican newspaper opera-tions. The charges, totalling USDollars 170m, pulled net earnings down to Dollars 166m, or 30 cents a share, from Dollars 292m, or 53 cents, in 1991, but dividends remained unchanged. Revenues rose to Dollars 5.98bn from Dollars 5.59bn. The main boost to last year's earnings came from the information and publishing division, whose operating profit climbed by 10 per cent to Dollars 401m, equal to 56 per cent of the total. New acquisitions contributed a 3.6 per cent increase, with the rest coming from growth of existing businesses. The company said overall opera-ting margins were maintain-ed. The information and publishing business accounted for the entire Dollars 336m spent by Thomson on acquisitions last year, which was double the 1991 acquisition budget. The company said that the results of its two biggest purchases, Institute for Scientific Information and Micromedex, both exceeded expectations. UK regional newspapers achieved 'substantial growth' in profits and margins. But the UK-based free newspapers incurred significantly higher operating losses. Thomson is planning to sell or close a number of its free sheets, and Dollars 60m of the special impairment charge relates to these titles. Thomson Travel, the UK's biggest tour operator, reported an increase in operating income to Dollars 115m from Dollars 101m. The figures include profits of Dollars 12m and Dollars 5m respectively from the sale of aircraft by Britannia Airways. Thomson Tour Operations sold 3.3m holidays in 1992, up 10 per cent from 1991. But fierce discounting last summer pushed down profits 'substantially'. The company said the market for summer 1993 holidays remains 'as competitive as that experienced last year'. TTO said it expected to sell a similar number of holidays as last year, with market share remaining about the same. In the light of the recent hostile takeover bid for Owners Abroad, the second-biggest tour operator, Thomson Travel affirmed its policy of remaining the leader 'whether measured by size, quality or profitability' in all markets in which it operates. 'We will not allow our competitive position to be eroded,' the company said. Owners Abroad this week succeeded in staving off the protracted Pounds 290m (Dollars 412m) bid by Airtours. The travel industry had predicted that Thomson would launch a ferocious price war had the Airtours bid succeeded.</p>

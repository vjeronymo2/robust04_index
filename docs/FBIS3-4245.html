			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by staff reporter Li Ping-hua (2621 3521 5478): </F> "Central Authorities Call for Efforts To Supervise and Manage  Foreign Enterprises According to Law, Strengthen Measures  Against Tax Evasion"]    [Text] Beijing, 20 Mar (TA KUNG PAO) -- A central leader  recently pointed out that while continuing to give play to the  role of foreign-invested enterprises, it is necesssary to  further strengthen and improve supervision and management over  them according to the law; to establish and develop mechanisms  for supervision and restraint on the input-output of the assets  of Chinese partners; to strengthen measures against tax  avoidance; and to promote the healthy development of  foreign-invested enterprises.    This leader also said: We welcome foreign investment in the  technical transformation of old enterprises and in  infrastructural projects, but a project may not get underway  until it is examined and approved according to required  procedures following a rational evaluation of state property by  a state-acknowledged appraisal institution, and after the  financial authorities and state property management authorities  have reviewed and confirmed the results. Promising a fixed  investment-recovery rate without authorization is not permitted.    The State Council has made it clear that in the future, it  is  necessary to strengthen guidance for foreign investments through  industrial policies; to continue to encourage foreign investment  in projects in infrastructure, basic industries, high- and  new-technology industries, and the technical transformation of  old enterprises; and to encourage the establishment of  export-oriented enterprises. It is especially necessary to try  to attract large enterprises and multinational companies to  invest and set up high- and new-technology projects in China,  and to open the domestic market to them selectively and to an  appropriate degree. Such projects as automotive assembly and  exclusive apartments, vacation villages, and deluxe recreational  facilities which exceed the actual demand should be curtailed.  Projects that cause a high level of pollution, require a high  level of material consumption, and endanger the ecosystem and  people's physical and mental health must be sternly forbidden.  Retailers partnering foreign enterprises must emphasize balance  of import and export and balance of payments in foreign  currencies. As this is quite a sensitive field, in which we  lack experience, prior approval must be obtained for pilot  operations, so as to to accumulate experience and improve  relevant laws and regulations before gradual expansion. At  present, attention must be focused on introducing experience in  the operation and management of chain stores abroad, so as to  activate the production and export of China's convenience  articles and raise the standards of commercial management and  service. In other fields of opening up where experience is also  lacking, pilot operations are also necessary before gradual  popularization. The joint-venture projects in the tertiary  industry to be set up now should concentrate on fields that  directly serve production.    This year, China will continue to let special economic zones  and the Shanghai Pudong New Zone act as pacesetters in the  reform and opening up; encourage these places and coastal open  areas to create a better investment environment; accelerate the  upgrading of products; and concentrate energies on developing  high- and new-technology industries and fund- and  technology-intensive tertiary industries. In order to gradually  narrow the gap between the eastern and western regions in  economic development, China will make a point of giving more  support to the central and western regions in the use of foreign  investment to exploit and utilize resources.    As for the development zone rush in recent years, the  central  authorities also have come to see a clearer picture in the  process of adjustment and rectification. The construction of  development zones should follow the principle of overall  planning, rational layout, acting according to capabilities,  gradual development, overcoming blindness, and raising the  efficiency of development. It is necessary to make a  conscientious effort to run well the economic and technological  development zones and bonded zones that have been approved. For  setting up new development zones and bonded zones, it is  necessary to conduct feasibility studies well and to secure  approval according to the required procedures. Development  zones that have been set up with approval should concentrate on  high- and new-technology and export-oriented projects, integrate  with the adjustment of industrial structure and the  transformation of old urban areas and old enterprises, and  integrate with the adjustment of industrial structure and  product mix. It is necessary to avoid the practice of  neglecting the transformation of old urban areas and old  enterprises and setting up large numbers of new concerns in the  development zones. Development zones should depend mainly on a  well-developed and healthy investment environment to attract  foreign investors, and may not formulate their own preferential  policies at the expense of national interests.</p>

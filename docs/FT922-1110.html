			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Support grows for private landlords THERE IS widespread support among politicians and housing experts for reviving the private landlord system, a report commissioned by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the social research organisation, said yesterday. It called for incentives to encourage private landlords and to secure funding for rented housing from financial institutions. The report said reversing the decline in private rented housing was the only way to meet the demand that councils and housing associations could not meet. Revival would require government subsidies to bridge the gap between landlords' likely income from rents and the returns available from comparable investments. The Future of Private Renting.

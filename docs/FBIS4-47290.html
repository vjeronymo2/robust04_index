As a result of a parametric numerical study it was  found that the optimum solution has two branches and the  optimization process has a bifurcation character: with some wing  span value there is a jumplike switch from one branch of the  solution to another, accompanied by a fundamental change in the  appearance of the optimized wing. The characteristic  configurations of optimum wings are illustrated. An appreciable  gain in hypersonic quality is obtained in a wide range of angles  of attack. An algorithm is proposed for computing pressure in  the inverse problem of streamline flow with a given form of  jump. The pressure distributions on the surface of optimum wings  are studied. Computations of aerodynamic forces are made by  direct integration of pressure, making it possible to refine the  maximum hypersonic quality value, which proved to be greater  than that found by the authors earlier using an approximate  formula. This article represents a continuation of earlier work  along these same lines by the same authors (``Optimization of  Spatial Configuration of Supporting Surfaces With Short  Elongation at Hypersonic Velocities,'' ZH. VYCHISL. MATEM. I  MATEM. FIZ., Vol. 31, No. 12, pp 1858-1870, 1991; ``Increasing  Aerodynamic Quality of Wings With a Short Elongation at  Hypersonic Velocities,'' PRIKL. MATEM. I MEKHAN., Vol. 56, No.  3, pp 392-403, 1992) and draws heavily on these materials.  Figures 7; references: 9 Russian.</p>

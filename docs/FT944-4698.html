			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: BSS advances to Pounds 6.7m midway Interim profits at BSS Group, the heating, plumbing and process control supplier, grew 33 per cent from Pounds 5.07m to Pounds 6.74m. The shares edged ahead 1p to 520p, prompting Mr Peter Cooper, chief executive, to remark that the group's shares were always 'slow to respond'. However, he said he was pleased with the results. Turnover in the six months to September 30 rose 13 per cent to Pounds 139.7m (Pounds 123.3m). Operating profits emerged 27 per cent ahead at Pounds 7.11m (5.58m), after a Pounds 100,000 charge for the reorganisation of the domestic division. Mr Cooper said that 'at long last', the group had seen a degree of recovery in the industrial and commercial construction industry. He thought that after 'three, though it seems like four, years of recession', this recovery looked set to continue. 'We have seen a 2 1/2 per cent increase in the market as it affects us, as a group,' he said, adding that BSS was now being vindicated in its policy of not reducing investment through the recession. The industrial and commercial division, comprising BSS and Manor, lifted profits 16 per cent to Pounds 7.99m (Pounds 6.88m) on turnover up at Pounds 84m (Pounds 78.5m). Sales on the domestic side expanded 24 per cent to Pounds 55.7m (Pounds 44.8m) and losses were reduced to Pounds 31,000 (Pounds 567,000). Mr Cooper said the division, which is heavily biased towards the colder second half, was recovering market share. He reckoned that the whole market had grown 3.7 per cent on last time and that the division's share rose from 10 to 12 per cent. This puts the group second behind Wolseley, which has 27 per cent. Mr Cooper said BSS now had a base for organic growth over the next two or three years. The new distribution centre was complete and the unification of the whole group onto one computer system was in process. Earnings were 16.7p (12.3p) per share and the interim dividend is lifted to 6.25p (5.75p).</p>

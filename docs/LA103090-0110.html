			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT;  </P> <P> WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> CHARGERS;  </P> <P> GOEAS HAS KNEE SURGERY; HE WILL MISS TWO GAMES  </P> <P> Left tackle Leo Goeas had arthroscopic knee surgery Monday to repair cartilage  damage in his knee. Charger Coach Dan Henning said he expects Goeas to miss one  or two games.  </P> <P> Joel Patten, activated Saturday off injured reserve, will share time with Eric  Floyd in Goeas' absence. Patten played his first game this season in Sunday's  41-10 victory over Tampa Bay at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium.  </P> <P> Other injuries:  </P> <P> Tackle Broderick Thompson, who suffered a slight ankle sprain Sunday, is  expected to be ready for Sunday's game at Seattle. Safety Martin Bayless, who  missed Sunday's game with an ankle injury, is also expected back.  </P> <P> Henning was asked if he said anything to his quarterback, Billy Joe Tolliver,  after Tolliver was greeted by the home fans with a chorus of boos Sunday.  </P> <P> "No," Henning said. "We didn't expect chimes."  </P> <P> General manager Bobby Beathard said Tolliver played his best game of the season  Sunday. Tolliver completed only 11 of 24 passes for 157 yards and a touchdown,  but four were dropped.  </P> <P> "He's a very tough kid," Beathard said. "He's been able to withstand the  pressure."

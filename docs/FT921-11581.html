			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Luck finally runs out for the great survivor of Irish politics: A scandal too many led coalition partners to pull rug from under Haughey - The downfall of Ireland's prime minister 'LIKE HIM or loathe him, it was impossible to ignore him. Irish politics will certainly be duller without him as Taoiseach.' The 38-year political career of Mr Charles Haughey, 12 of them as leader of his Fianna Fail party and four times elected prime minister, was thus summed up yesterday by one of Mr Haughey's arch opponents, Mr Prionsias de Rossa, the leader of the Worker's Party. The 'great survivor' of the Irish political scene, a self-made man who seemed to thrive on controversy, Mr Haughey finally ran out of luck this week, when a telephone-tapping scandal from nine years ago came back to haunt him. A former justice minister, Mr Sean Doherty, told an astonished press conference last week, that Mr Haughey had been fully aware that two journalists' telephones had been illegally bugged in an attempt to trace cabinet leaks. Mr Haughey has always denied the allegations. But for the Progressive Democrats, the junior partners in his coalition, the truth of the allegations were no longer relevant. The government's credibility was at stake, and they demanded he resign or face an election. The incident was the culmination of a succession of scandals in which close associates of Mr Haughey became embroiled in property and share-deals involving state-run companies. Barely a week has gone by since last September, without Mr Haughey having to defend himself against vitriolic opposition attacks in the parliament over his alleged involvement. At one point, an opposition deputy described him as 'looking like a lawyer defending a poor brief'. Last week the Progressive Democrats decided they had had enough. Backbenchers and ministers in his party were equally nervous at the prospect of an early general election. In the five elections since Mr Haughey became party leader in 1979, an absolute parliamentary majority has eluded him, forcing him into coalitions with which he has never been really comfortable. Mr Des O'Malley, the Progressive Democrats leader, praised the 1992 budget presented on Wednesday by Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister. Mr Ahern is a strong candidate to succeed Mr Haughey, and whether he decides to challenge Mr Albert Reynolds, a former finance minister who is considered the strongest candidate, or to throw his support behind him, the future of the coalition is guaranteed. Like Mrs Thatcher, with whom Mr Haughey crossed swords in 1985 over the Anglo-Irish agreement (which he described as 'a sad day for Irish nationalism), he will not be a comfortable figure on the backbenches. Last year, following intense pressure to resign, he said 'growing roses is not the same as a political career'. He was even to adopt Thatcherite economic policies in the late-80s when he regained the premiership, admitting that borrowing and budget deficits 'make matters worse'. He hands on a financially-sound government. As a pragmatist rather than an ideologue he even came to accept the Anglo-Irish agreement as the framework for progress on Northern Ireland.</p>

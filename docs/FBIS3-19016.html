			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Date for Membership Can Be Observed"] </F>   [Excerpts] In statements on the European Union [EU] to the  Bundesrat on Thursday [10 March], Chancellor Franz Vranitzky and  Foreign Minister Alois Mock both expressed optimism that the EU  will reach agreement on the issue of the blocking minority and  that the EU schedule can be maintained with 1 January 1995 as  the date for accession. In political terms, the traffic lights  on the road to a common Europe have been showing "green" for  Austria since 1 March.    "I am going on the assumption," Mock said, "that in the next  few days it will be possible to formalize the membership  negotiations." In their statements Vranitzky and Mock briefed  the Bundesrat about the conclusion of the negotiations about  Austria's EU membership. For Vranitzky the result of the  negotiations is "certainly something that can be shown proudly"  at home and abroad. He stressed that during the intensive  discussions over the next weeks and months until the referendum,  it will also be pointed out "that in some small, definable  fields it will be necessary to make adjustments." Some people  see this as a disadvantage. However, with a view to  safeguarding the future, this is not a disadvantage.    Vranitzky also pointed out that our eastern neighboring  countries are already "knocking" on the EU's door. This refutes  the argument that Austria wants to join a European "fortress."  The EU is not a "fortress" but the "core" of the process of  European unification.    The foreign minister, too, stressed that "we have achieved  an  overall result that we can present to the Austrian people for  the referendum with a clear conscience." The result of the  negotiations shows "that we are moving along the path toward a  common Europe with self-confidence." Austria now has the  opportunity to join an EU in which peace and security are not  empty utopias and which offers the concrete hope that national  wars between its members will become impossible. "We simply  must not miss the historic opportunity to belong to such a  union," Mock stressed.    At a press conference on Thursday Nationalrat President  Heinz  Fischer cited three constitutional requirements for joining the  EU, which is to form the basis for the EU referendum. The law is  to contain a "clear constitutional authorization" for the state  organs to ratify the EU accession. Furthermore, it is to  facilitate a clear yes or no in the referendum and to define the  contents of the EU treaty exactly. As a date for the  referendum, 12 June has "great appeal" for Fischer, because that  is the day on which the elections to the European Parliament  will be held. However, the deadlines for 12 June are very tight  and thus 19 June is more likely.    According to Fischer the Federal Constitutional Law on  joining the EU is to be brief and precise. A clear definition  of the contents of the treaty will render it legally impossible  for any kind of changes are made in the text of the treaty after  the referendum. Fischer called the accusation by Freedom Party  of Austria Chairman Joerg Haider that the government might  present a "fraudulent package" as a "politically unfair  insinuation." [passage omitted]    Heinz Fischer also commented on the internal EU discussion  about the question of the blocking minority for votes in the  Nationalrat of the expanded EU. Since it is, in particular,  Spain that is blocking a decision on this issue, Fischer  appealed to those responsible in Madrid not to turn this problem  into a stumbling block for the accession of strong new members,  which is also very important for the EU. Fischer expressed  optimism that this conflict will be solved in time so that the  EU schedule will not be endangered. [passage omitted]</p>

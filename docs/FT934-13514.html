			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Lloyd's insurance It would be a relief if brinkmanship over the future of Lloyd's came to an end with yesterday's vote in favour of the introduction of corporate capital. The threat of litigation from disaffected Names still has to be resolved. But that is not a mortal threat if a steady supply of corporate capital can now be secured. Still, agents acting for the proposed Lloyd's investment trusts might find themselves diverted from the task of analysing and negotiating with underwriting syndicates. Another round of legal action against market professionals would do little for Lloyd's attempt to rebuild its image among international investors. Both sides have an interest in reaching a settlement. Yet it is difficult to see where cash to meet claims for restitution might come from. Providers of corporate capital are unwilling to foot the bill. The proposal that Lloyd's should raise a loan to fund a settlement is unlikely to win support, since interest payments would dilute underwriting returns in future years. Reserves within Lloyd's itself are insufficient to satisfy Names. With corporate capital in the bag, though, Lloyd's management has the stronger hand.</p>

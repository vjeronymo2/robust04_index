			<p>BFN     [Text] Ambassador 'Umar Yusuf Baridu, the first under  secretary of the Foreign Ministry, has denied reports carried by  some news agencies and media organs on Sudanese troops taking  part in the ongoing war in Yemen. He added that the propagation  of such allegations may be aimed at widening the scope of the  war using it as a pretext for foreign intervention in the  ongoing conflict in Yemen. Ambassador Baridu reaffirmed Sudan's  principled attitude toward what was taking place in fraternal  Yemen as exemplified by Sudan's eagerness to see the crisis  approached within a Yemeni context. He said Sudan's position  was based on clear and specific principles, including  noninterference in the internal affairs of states and commitment  to the charters of the United Nations, OAU, and the Arab League.</p>

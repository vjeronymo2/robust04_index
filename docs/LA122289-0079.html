			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE NOTES;  </P> <P> KIMBLE TOPS 50 POINTS 3 TIMES  </P> <P> Bo Kimble's scoring assault during Hank Gathers' absence is taking on epic  proportions.  </P> <P> Kimble goes into Saturday's Oklahoma game with three straight performances of  more than 50 points (his 57 against Athletes in Action isn't officially  recognized as part of the schedule), raising memories of the late 1960s when  the likes of Pete Maravich, Calvin Murphy, Rick Mount and Elvin Hayes made  nightly raids on the record books.  </P> <P> Maravich, who set most NCAA scoring records for Louisiana State, scored 50 or  more 10 times, including three in succession as a junior -- 66 against Tulane,  50 against Florida and 54 against Auburn.  </P> <P> Murphy, a scoring whiz at Niagara, scored 50 points six times, including a  one-week span as a junior when he got 50 against St. Peter's, Buffalo and  Syracuse. Notre Dame scoring star Austin Carr managed back-to-back 50-point  games three times, including 61 against Ohio and 52 against Kentucky in the  1970 NCAA Tournament. Mississippi's Johnny Neumann hit 53 against Vanderbilt  and 60 against Baylor in successive games in 1970. Mount of Purdue, Hayes of  Houston, Bill Bradley of Princeton and Rick Barry of Miami are among the  all-time collegiate scoring stars who never managed back-to-back 50-pointers.  </P> <P> Kimble, with 51 against UC Santa Barbara and 53 against Oregon State, has  raised his season average to 34.4, which tops the NCAA.  </P> <P> What is unusual about Kimble's increased production is that he has shot fewer  three-pointers and is working inside with Gathers out. Basically, he's scoring  for two.  </P> <P> "I and my teammates try to make ourselves versatile so that we can play other  positions," Kimble said. "I'm trying to show my leadership. I wanted to take  the ball inside to replace Hank. I figure if I can take the ball to the basket  I have a higher percentage (of making the shot)."  </P> <P> In his recent spree, Kimble has hit 35 of 51 shots, 22 of 23 free throws and  six of seven three-pointers.  </P> <P> Even his teammates were amazed at how tough the 6-foot-5 Kimble has been on the  boards in Gathers' absence. He had 12 rebounds against Oregon State and 16 in  the exhibition against Athletes in Action.  </P> <P> "He's a great outside shooter," Lions Coach Paul Westhead said, "but he may be  even better inside."  </P> <P> Earl Martin's demeanor usually reflects his nickname -- Sleepy -- but the  fifth-year senior out of Carson has caught much of the Pacific-10 Conference  napping.  </P> <P> The forward for the Oregon State basketball team has played most of his career  in the shadow of stars like All-American guard Gary Payton but is quietly  moving up through the Beavers' record book in many categories.  </P> <P> Against Loyola on Tuesday, the 6-foot-5 Martin had a quiet 16 points, hitting  seven of 11 shots, to raise his season average to 12.9. That put him within 57  points of becoming the 23rd player in Oregon State's 1,000-point club. Martin  is 312 points from breaking into the Beavers' career top 10 scorers. If he  does, it won't get much mention because Payton -- who scored 48 points Tuesday  -- will be breaking most school career records.  </P> <P> Martin, who played only five games as a freshman due to injury and was awarded  another year's eligibility, cracked Coach Ralph Miller's starting lineup the  next season and has averaged 8.8 points on 50.4% shooting since. This season he  has added the three-pointer to his arsenal. After making only four of 21  three-point shots in the previous three seasons, Martin has hit 14 of 25 (56%)  this season, helping explain his increased scoring.  </P> <P> "Of course, everything up here is Payton, but I think I've helped the team a  lot and I'm looking forward to doing more," Martin said. "I checked where I was  this summer (in career standings) and figured I could get in the top 10."  </P> <P> Martin worked on his three-pointer this summer. He said the coaching changeover  from Ralph Miller to longtime assistant Jim Anderson has given the players more  individual leeway.  </P> <P> That game plan didn't include losing to Loyola at Corvallis. "That was a fun  game to play, but it didn't turn out the way we wanted," Martin said. "We try  not to lose any games at home. Our goal is always to be undefeated here, so it  was a letdown."  </P> <P> Martin has long been like a familiar character actor whose name nobody quite  remembers, even at Carson High where he signed an early letter of intent with  Oregon State then saw teammate Earl Foreman outshine him. But without doing the  spectacular, Martin has always been a steady.  </P> <P> Martin's nickname refers to the smallish Beaver team two years ago that was  known as Miller's Dwarfs. The laid-back Martin, appropriately enough, became  Sleepy.  </P> <P> "Now I'm trying to wake up a little bit," Martin joked. "If things go my way, I  hope to keep on playing (after college)."  </P> <P> That would be no small accomplishment.  </P> <P> The Loyola Marymount women's basketball team, which had lost five straight  games and its outside touch, got back in the groove this week in a 85-71  victory over visiting Western Michigan.  </P> <P> The Lions shot 52% from the field and had the best shooting night of the season  from guard Kristen Bruich, who hit nine of 17 shots, including five of seven  from three-point range to ring up 28 points. Her back-court companion, Lynn  Flanagan, added 20 points on six of 11 accuracy and hit eight of nine free  throws. The Lions' shooting was augmented by forward Jamie Jesko, who hit four  of six shots off the bench. The Lions held the visitors to 42.5% shooting, 35%  in the second half.  </P> <P> The victory raised the Lions' record to 3-5. After taking the Christmas weekend  off, they take a chilly holiday swing north, playing at Boise State on Thursday  and Idaho State next Saturday before returning to Gersten Pavilion in January  for a five-game home stand and the start of conference play.  </P> <P> College Notes: Basketball official Bill McCabe on working hectic Loyola  Marymount games: "I did six of them last year. I've paid my dues" . . . The Cal  State Dominguez Hills women's soccer team was honored with a proclamation from  the Carson City Council for its outstanding season.  </P></p>

			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / World Commodities Prices: Aluminium peaks - Market report ALUMINIUM's price touched a 6 1/2 -month peak on the LME as speculators gambled that the plan for global producer cuts would succeed. Late profit-taking pegged the rise and three-month aluminium closed at Dollars 1,246.25 a tonne, up Dollars 10.50. Aluminium prices have gained 12 per cent this month and are 21 per cent above 1993's eight-year lows. Traders suggested the COPPER market would not be troubled by Codelco's trading losses and prices tested Dollars 1,890 a tonne again before three-months metal closed at Dollars 1,883.50, up Dollars 11. GOLD drifted lower amid rumours that Venezuela's financially troubled Banco Latino might have 10 to 15 tonnes to dump. Compiled from Reuters</p>

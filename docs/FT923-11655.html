			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Leading Article: From chronic to critical THE ITALIAN state is on the brink, both financially and morally. But amid the stale and corrupt atmosphere of Italy's politics, Professor Giuliano Amato represents a breath of fresh air. The new prime minister knows his country is fast heading for a financial crisis and wants to prevent it. Yet his budget plans are too small to make more than a small dent in the bloated budget deficit; and his admirable vigour has blown away the veil of complacency that masked the eyes of the world's financial markets, making his task even more difficult. Success requires emphatic parliamentary support for a more ambitious budget package. Failure remains the more likely outcome. Italy has been living on borrowed time for almost a decade. Membership of Europe's exchange rate mechanism signifies Italy's determination to remain at Europe's centre. But its politicians have never been able to modernise and slim down the Italian state along European lines. Instead, the ERM and the abolition of capital controls have removed the inflation tax as a source of revenue to fund the Italian state. Rather than cut spending or find new sources of tax revenue, its politicians have been borrowing at an accelerating and unsustainable rate. Italy's bluff would inevitably have been called sooner or later. It is the only European country in which the stock of government debt both exceeds the annual output of the entire economy and is still rising. Already, in the first four months of 1992, the budget deficit was overshooting its target range by more than 50 per cent. Yet, ironically, the markets have turned against the lira just when a government appears finally to have realised the seriousness of Italy's plight. The differential between Italian and German short-term interest rates has grown by 5 percentage points since the end of April and by more than 3 percentage points in the past three weeks. And the lira remains close to the bottom of its permitted range within the ERM. The markets' nervousness reflects, in part, the government's weakness. Mr Amato's team of technocrats, backed by only a slim parliamentary majority, looks feeble set against the massed parliamentary representatives of Italy's complacent vested interests. Yet the government has also made mistakes. Its privatisation plans remain vague, while the clumsy handling of the partial debt default by Efim, the state holding company, can only undermine investor confidence. Most important, the government's proposed budget package is too small even to stabilise Italy's debt stock this year, let alone start to reduce it. A stable debt ratio is a minimum requirement if the markets are to be pacified. But the L30,000bn in extra taxes and spending cuts is only half the figure that would be required to do the job. Even if parliament agrees to Mr Amato's package, the deficit will remain in double figures while the primary budget, excluding interest payments, will remain in rough balance. Stabilising the debt ratio would require a primary budget surplus of at least 2-3 per cent. The government, as a result, finds itself locked in a vicious circle of rising interest rates, slower growth and rising deficits and debt. Every 1 percentage point rise in interest rates adds another L15,000bn to the government's interest bill, pushing the required primary surplus ever higher. Italy must regain the confidence of the financial markets. It cannot afford to wait until next year's budget to introduce reforms which will set the debt stock on a downward path. To give in to market pressure and devalue the lira, without first putting in place a serious fiscal package, would only further undermine confidence and accelerate inflation. But it cannot go back to the good old days of capital controls, low interest rates and high inflation without waving goodbye to the ERM. An additional budget package of pensions reform and extra direct taxation is required on a scale which would together cut the budget deficit by a further 3 percentage points this year. This package should be presented to parliament as a vote of confidence in the Italian state, a vote for modernisation and against accelerating inflation. Mr Amato represents Italy's last best hope of avoiding a financial calamity.</p>

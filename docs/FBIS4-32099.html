			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by wk: "Foreign Investors' Industrial-Commercial </F> Chamber; `Strategy'--Yes, but..."]    [Text] Foreign investors are happy that the  government announced an economic program covering several years.  Still, they would like to get familiar with details of the  program.    Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak met with foreign investors  yesterday. "We are united by a common goal--to score success in  a market economy and in building democracy," said Pawlak.  "Foreign investors who are members of the  [industrial-commercial] chamber, as well as their Polish  partners, support those political forces that guarantee the  development of a market economy open to the world and based on  private ownership," replied Chairman Stefan Lewandowski.    The businessmen had high praise for the government for  having  prepared the "Strategy for Poland," which creates the foundation  for making business plans based on reliable data. Still, they  asked the prime minister to provide more details.    Foreign investors asked the prime minister when the  government will speed up the privatization process. "More  companies may have been sold earlier, but, in general, these  were sales for low prices. We are not eager to see privatization  at any cost," Pawlak responded.    "What about taxes? Can we count on stability in the tax  system?" the investors kept asking. "We are eager to see  stability. There is the VAT [value-added tax], there are customs  duties and income tax, and that should be enough," Pawlak  explained.</p>

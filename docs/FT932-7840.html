			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Arts: Enterprising 'Soundbites]' - Opera The BOC Covent Garden Festival, a highly various affair, got underway this week. At the Donmar Warehouse on Tuesday and Wednesday we had 'Soundbites]' There was loose talk in advance about the commissioned '10-minute' pieces; in fact the norm for the five mini-operas - three commissioned, two older pieces by Gerald Barry and the late Stephen Oliver - was about twice as long as that. The company was the ENO's Contemporary Opera Studio (artistic director David Pountney), whose musical director David Barry and the producer and designer David Fielding achieved more than creditable results for every work. The composers, it seemed, were allowed to draw upon only a modest band: string quartet, flute, clarinet, harp and keyboards. In fact Sally Beamish used only three of them for her Ease, and Barry's 1977 The Garden just a whimsical cello and piano. But the striking thing (so to speak) was the absence of any percussion whatever, unless you counted the typewriters in Ease: even five years ago, I believe, the notion that a bunch of young composers might forgo percussion would have seemed wildly improbable. There was not a single synthesiser to be heard, nor any taped sounds; there were TV sets in David Horne's Jason Field, but their screens showed nothing. And where the teenage opera-composers reviewed here (glumly) by Andrew Clements last week resorted wholesale to minimalism - it enables you to write many more minutes of music with much less effort - there was no trace of that at the Donmar. Barry's Things that gain by being painted does offer minimal music in another sense; its quaint text, drawn from a 10th-century Japanese pillow book (and mostly spoken), is really all, and the instrumental duo supplies only airy asides. As the snobbish aesthete-heroine, Jacqueline Horner was encouraged toward theatrical over-statement, where a more innocent manner might allow us to relish her comic self-revelation more. Cooler impersonations by Lynne Davies and Andrew MacKenzie-Wicks, as bereaved wife and mysterious gardener, served The Garden better. As often with Oliver, the score sounded fluently effective, without promising that further acquaintance would discover anything more strongly coherent. Ease is a punning title, for its 'E's are the suicidal Emma Bovary and Eleanor Marx, who made the first English translation of Flaubert's novel. In Edward Kemp's text they become ghostly, anguished intimates, to no great purpose, though Miss Davies and Margaret Preece enacted them with fervour. The Beamish score sports some interesting, short-breathed ideas of its own, but scarcely turns the situation into music-drama. At different, confident extremes, the music of Horne's Jason Field and Colin Huehns' Solid Assets lent far more vital charges to their texts. In the former, a 27-year-old labourer meets - perhaps only in imagination - the parents of a 12-year-old boy he has murdered. In the cast-list they appear simply as Mother, Father and Son, which suggests how their instinctive family roles will reach across the dreadful confrontation. Overlapping sung lines left many details inaudible; but in any case, what Horne has through-composed is really a dramatic cantata a tre, one with an instrumental ensemble as prominent and as urgently expressive as the voices. The idiom is up-to-date but palatable and clear, and respectful of British tradition (he is a Scot): it struck me that Jason Field seemed a natural descendant of, say, Vaughan Williams' On Wenlock Edge. Huehns is plainly a natural theatre composer. Meredith Oakes's rhyming text for Solid Assets is a wry, neatly amusing sketch, and Huehns finds bright musical touches, sometimes bare-faced devices, for bringing it all to crisp life. As a 'gross', middle-aged art-lover who is happy to pay millions for an ancient Egyptian piece that is now less than dust, the baritone Karl Morgan Daymond was no less apt and sonorous than as the homicidal young hunk in Jason Field: this singer has a fine career before him. The role of the art-dealer allowed MacKenzie-Wicks at last to exercise his lyrical tenor to best effect, and Miss Horner made a doughty art-widow. Huehns is bound to go off in some enterprising direction; it will be interesting to learn which one he chooses.

			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> Singer-actor Howard Keel, saying it has taken him more than 37 years to get  across town from the MGM lot to the Greek Theatre, will finally make his Los  Angeles concert performance debut when he appears as a special attraction July  15 at the Greek. During his years at MGM, he starred in a score of musical  films, including "Show Boat," "Annie Get Your Gun" and "Seven Brides for Seven  Brothers." For the last several years, he's been on the lot working as Clayton  Farlow in the long-running CBS series "Dallas." This fall, he'll be heading out  for his fifth concert tour in five years of the United Kingdom. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

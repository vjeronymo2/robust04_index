			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] In Bordj Bou Arreridj Province, Abderrahmane  Meziane Cherif, minister of interior, local authorities,  environment, and administrative reform, attended the official  installation of the governor today. He delivered a speech in  which he outlined the government program in the transitional  period. Over to Nourredine Daroui from Bordj Bou Arreridj:    [Daroui] In his meeting with officials and members of the  public, the minister talked about the internal situation in the  country in general.    [Begin Cherif recording] Regrettably, we notice that the  spirit of factionalism and extremism has triumphed over wisdom  and clear-sightedness. All Algerians have to overcome these  beliefs that are so incompatible with the national interest and  the spirit of fraternity and brotherliness which has enabled us,  through the centuries, to preserve our personality with all its  aspects. This is the spirit which led to the uprising of  November [1954] and its intrinsic significance. [end recording]    [Daroui] The interior minister also talked about the  importance and objectives of the transitional period in all  fields within the framework of action aimed at bringing the  country out of the stifling crisis it is going through. He said:    [Begin Cherif recording] The world is now watching, with  astonishment, our acute disagreements and our confrontations and  it is interfering in our affairs by supporting parties or  deviant groups. Local and then legislative elections were held  and democracy was nearly wiped out because some people regard it  as blasphemy, while others see it as a means to remove others.  Thus, we are now going through a transitional period which we  hope will take us, once and for all, out of the contradictions  and conflicts and lead us toward a bright future under  democracy, the democracy which respects the country's ideals.  [end recording]    [Daroui] Regarding the real perspectives for the future, the  interior minister pointed out that the best alternative is  action on the ground. [passage omitted]</p>

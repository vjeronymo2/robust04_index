			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Revenge of the Armenian diaspora: A decisive force in the long territorial war with Azerbaijan Until a year ago, two Californian men cut among the boldest images to be seen in Armenia's long separatist war with Azerbaijan, careening around the battlefield in a jeep with 'Crusaders' emblazoned across the doors and fighting harder than many local comrades. The pair was there as the Armenians penetrated deep into neighbouring Azerbaijan, grabbing a towering advantage over the enemy. One of them, an import-export trader named Mr Garo Kakhejian, was even suspected by the FBI of running guns to the homeland to buttress the Armenians' effort. Now, with a tense ceasefire holding since July, the Armenians seem poised to gain suzerainty over the patch of Azerbaijan for which they have fought since 1988; Azerbaijan, which has lost more than a fifth of its territory and been pushed to the brink of disintegration, appears ready to offer Armenia a political settlement in peace talks that have narrowed to one or two differences. But only one of the Californians will be around to savour the apparent triumph; Mr Kakhejian, 31, was killed by a sniper in June 1993. Now his buddy fights on alone. 'I'm not a Rambo, I'm not a trained specialist, but I do my best,' says Mr Chahe Ajamian, 32, at his friend's grave. . . . We have one slogan: 'Death or Freedom'.' If the Armenians do ultimately carve out an independent region of Azerbaijan for themselves, as seems probable, it will be largely a result of the efforts of zealous diaspora Armenians such as the California pair. The world's 8m-strong Armenian diaspora community, concentrated in the US cities of Boston, Fresno and Los Angeles, and in Paris, Beirut and Damascus, has been the war's key private backer. Responding to the Armenians' demand for independence in a tiny, kidney-shaped Azerbaijan region called Nagorno-Karabakh, diaspora groups have raised millions of dollars a year in telethons, political fund-raising drives and individual donations. In one California telethon alone in February, the radical, Athens-based Armenian Revolutionary Federation raised Dollars 1.5m, according to a group spokesman. The donations have helped break an Azerbaijan blockade of Armenia, financing food and clothing, but also arms, ammunition, communications and other equipment. The result has been to underpin Armenia's dramatic shift from a rear-guard defence of Nagorno-Karabakh two years ago to its vast advantage today. The success of the Armenian diaspora illustrates an outgrowth of Europe's post-cold war rash of nationalist wars. This has been an increase in the power of diaspora groups - especially from eastern Europe and former Soviet bloc nations such as Ukraine and the Baltics - to influence politics in the western countries where they live, and in the nations from which they emigrated. A decade ago, Armenian diaspora organisations were near political pariahs in Europe and the US, as Armenian extremists went on a 10-year terrorist streak in which 41 Turkish diplomats around the world were slain. Now, groups such as the Armenian Assembly of America and the Armenian Revolutionary Federation, known as 'Dashnak', operating in the US Congress, the United Nations and the Elysee, are among the world's most sophisticated political lobbyists, according to western political analysts and diplomats. Their influence has almost entirely overshadowed Azerbaijan's thus-far feeble efforts in Washington. Nagorno-Karabakh has been a binding glue for the diaspora, which grew up after the 1915 massacre of up to 1m Armenians in Ottoman Turkey. Armenian groups, for example, have claimed credit for the US Congress's decision to single out Azerbaijan for Washington's only sanctions in the ex-Soviet Union; the 1992 Freedom Support Act bars all but humanitarian aid to Azerbaijan because of its blockade of Armenia. Meanwhile, Armenia was allocated Dollars 195m in 1993 US aid, second only to Russia among ex-Soviet states. Analysts say the lobby has been especially skilfull in targeting campaign contributions. One of its strongest supporters, the Democratic congressman Mr Joseph Kennedy II, for example, received more than 10 per cent of his 1994 individual campaign donations from Armenian contributors, according to public records in Washington. 'There is a real sense in the (US government) agencies that Armenia absolutely must not be slighted,' says Mr Corbin Lyday, of the Stanford-Berkeley Department of Soviet and post-Soviet Studies. The war has its roots in Josef Stalin's divide-and-rule tactic of shifting entire ethnic populations on to others' lands, or awarding one people political control over land populated by a rival nationality. In 1923, Stalin laid the seeds for today's war by placing the Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians under Azeri control. In 1988, the Armenian population openly rebelled, alleging decades of discrimination against its language and culture, and the fighting has escalated steadily since. In July, Moscow brokered a truce, and has proposed that Russian troops form a cordon between the two sides. Peace talks have narrowed to two questions - who will control a strategic corridor between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia proper called Lachin, and a town called Shusha, to which both sides claim a sentimental attachment. The Armenians now control both and, since Azerbaijan has few bargaining chips aside from hoped-for leverage from Moscow, the chances are that the Azeris will not regain control over either. The diaspora's most important assistance has come on the battlefield itself. The Armenians' weapons and ammunition caches far outstrip their obvious resources; diaspora groups are responsible for supplying a significant part of the materiel, and Moscow the remainder, western analysts say. A puzzling feature of the diaspora support, however, has been a relative dearth of army volunteers. Just four to five dozen diaspora Armenians have fought at any one time, say local and western sources. Almost all these volunteers have been from Lebanon and Syria. One of them is Mr Mike Melkonian, 41, who until recently operated a jewellery store in Montibello, California. Wounded in the back earlier this year, Mr Melkonian was interviewed on his return to Montibello to recuperate. 'I'm going to spend two or three days in the jacuzzi,' he said, lounging on an airliner from Yerevan. 'But then I'm coming back. Not everyone can fight.'</p>

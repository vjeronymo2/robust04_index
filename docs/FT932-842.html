			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Letter: Morse put on wrong TV beat Sir, It was clever detective work by you to discover the solution to the mystery being investigated by Inspector Morose in the BT3 campaign. Unfortunately, though unravelling the clues, you made one serious error: Inspector Morse is one of Central Television's many successful dramas and not Thames's, as Observer said ('BT3 - the end', June 23). I fear you are destined to continual walking on the beat without any sergeant stripes, if you make errors like this. John Palmer, controller, press and publicity, Central Broadcasting, Central House, Broad Street, Birmingham</p>

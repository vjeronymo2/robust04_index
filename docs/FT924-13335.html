			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / China rejects British proposals on Hong Kong airport finance THE long-standing Sino-British deliberations over the financing of Hong Kong's new airport reached another impasse yesterday when China's negotiators rejected Britain's latest proposals, despite these being based on ideas put forward by the Chinese. Mr Anthony Galsworthy, Britain's senior representative within the Sino-British airport committee, said 'they criticised most aspects of (the) proposals, but they put forward no ideas of any kind of their own'. Britain had suggested injecting an extra Dollars HK40bn (Pounds 3bn) in revenue from land sales connected to the airport infrastructure, in an adaptation of China's own proposals. China's main concerns were over the possibility that Hong Kong might be saddled with airport-related debt after 1997 when sovereignty of the colony reverts to China. The latest proposals were viewed as a more cost-effective strategy, which would at least buy the support of China. The only interpretation of China's latest refusal to play ball is that the discussions are now purely about politics and not economics. There had been little expectation of any resolution of the dispute before Governor Chris Patten's visit to Beijing next week. The proposals had been met with a barrage of criticism from pro-Beijing newspapers that only weeks before had been offering similar ideas as a workable solution. Mr Galsworthy indicated that Britain would not be calling for a further meeting. 'I think it is impractical for the British side constantly to produce new proposals which the Chinese side then reject. If they don't like our proposals, we would expect them to produce some ideas of their own,' he said. Mr Patten has said that if China wanted to go ahead, a decision could be reached in a morning, over a cup of coffee. But he has six weeks to get to the coffee table before the close of the deadline for the Dollars 9bn airport site formation contract. Beyond November, this contract might have to be re-tendered, resulting in the escalating costs that the Chinese negotiators claim to be most anxious to avoid.</p>

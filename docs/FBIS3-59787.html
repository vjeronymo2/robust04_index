			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The Government Industrial Research Institute in  Osaka (GIRI/Osaka director: Reikichi Iwamoto), which is part of  the Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, has  successfully developed a solid electrolyte battery with high  electrical output at room temperature. The battery reportedly  suffered no loss of performance even after 200 repeated charging  and discharging operations.    Until now, solid electrolyte batteries have demonstrated  poor  ion conductivity and weak current output at room temperature.  The solid electrolyte battery which GIRI has developed resolves  these problems by employing a solid electrolyte called  tetramethyl-ammoniumhydroxide pentahydrate which is known to  have good hydrogen ion conductivity.    The tetramethylammonium hydroxide pentahydrate battery  maintains its hydrogen ion conduction properties even when  melted and recooled. When this material is used as the  electrolyte, the battery uses nickel hydroxide for the positive  electrode and a hydrogen-occluded alloy for the negative  electrode. When the hydrate is melted and enclosed, the gap  between electrolyte particles, and the electrical resistance  between the electrolyte and electrodes, decreases. As a result,  a high current density of 10 milliamps per square centimeter is  obtained.    The solid electrolyte battery suffered no loss in  performance  even after being subjected to repeated charging and discharging  up to 200 times between temperatures of 0&deg;C to 40&deg;C.  When the battery was left to stand for one day after being  charged, however, electrical output dropped and it could not be  used at temperatures greater than 40&deg;C, so GIRI says it  plans to try and resolve this problem in the future.</p>

			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Reichmann and top investor plan US property venture MR Paul Reichmann, the man at the centre of the world's most spectacular property company collapse, is to advise Mr George Soros, one of the world's most successful money managers, on the real estate market as the two join forces to invest in north American commercial property. Mr Soros, a Hungarian-born Wall Street investor, made more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) speculating against sterling on 'Black Wednesday' last autumn. Toronto-based Mr Reichmann built Olympia &amp; York into the world's biggest property developer in the 1970s and 1980s, only to see its main Canadian business file for bankruptcy court protection from creditors last May. Canary Wharf, O&amp;Y's development in London's Docklands, has been in the care of administrators since then. The deal represents a remarkable vote of confidence in Mr Reichmann, who was praised by Mr Soros yesterday as 'one of the most astute and visionary figures in real estate investment'. The Soros-Reichmann partnership, to be formally announced today, follows last Friday's approval by an Ontario court for O&amp;Y to emerge from bankruptcy protection, albeit as a shadow of its former self. Mr Reichmann, who will have no executive relationship with the ongoing O&amp;Y, is setting up a new company, Reichmann International, which will provide advisory services on property matters to Soros Fund Management, Mr Soros's private investment management firm. This already has in-house property experts. Mr Soros is establishing a new fund, Quantum Realty, which plans to raise up to Dollars 525m to invest in property, with up to another Dollars 130m available from Soros-related co-investors. Mr Soros and Mr Reichmann, as the representative of the Reichmann family, will jointly contribute Dollars 75m-Dollars 100m to Quantum Realty. Much of the remainder seems likely to come from investors in Mr Soros' existing, Netherlands Antilles-based funds, who have the option to plough back more than Dollars 1bn of 1992 fund profits into new Soros investment vehicles. The deal is also significant because of the interest Mr Soros is displaying in the north American property market, severely depressed for two years. Mr Soros said he believed now was a time of 'great opportunity to begin to assemble a prime portfolio of commercial real estate at advantageous prices'. Observer, Page 13</p>

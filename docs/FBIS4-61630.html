			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian Government is working out a new  mechanism for state support to the north, Deputy Prime Minister  Sergey Shakhray has told INTERFAX. He said that the northern  regions were today the hardest hit by the socioeconomic crisis,  and because of the short Polar summer, delivery of cargoes to  hundreds of districts takes over a year. Delivery of essential  freight was previously financed through the credit system, but  owing to high Central Bank interest rates, northern enterprises  have been unable to repay these credits. The government is  currently working on extending the effectiveness of an  advantageous system of granting credits, and is setting up a  federal fund to back delivery of goods to the north. This year  over seven billion rubles are to be allocated from the state  budget into the new fund. Supplies to the north will be  interrupted unless state resources are transferred to the fund  in good time, Sergey Shakhray pointed out.</p>

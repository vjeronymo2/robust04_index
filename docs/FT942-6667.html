			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Survey of Residential Property (7): Debate over home curbs - Andorra and Switzerland Swiss parliamentarians will begin debating a series of government proposals next month to loosen the country's severe restrictions on the acquisition of property by foreigners. The main elements in the proposed liberalisation are enlarged and more flexible quotas for foreigners to buy holiday homes and the elimination of restrictions on foreign residents in Switzerland buying property for their own use. If accepted by both houses of parliaments, and provided that no one insists that it be put to a referendum, the package could become law late this year or early next. However, it is always difficult to judge the mood of parliament or the Swiss electorate on this issue. The current restrictions, built around the so-called Lex Friedrich, were put in place in 1985 when the Swiss were anxious that every available Alp would be taken over for holiday homes by rich Germans and Italians. Since, the property boom in the country has collapsed and in some mountain holiday areas, especially in French Switzerland, hard-pressed local developers are pleading to be allowed to sell more holiday homes to foreigners. Moreover, the political environment surrounding Switzerland has changed since the mid-1980s. Harmonisation of many laws and regulations in EU countries has increased the pressure on Switzerland to fall into step. Lex Friedrich also infringes the spirit of Switzerland's commitments under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Substantial liberalisation in many areas, including property ownership, would have been forced on the country if it had joined the European Economic Area (EEA), an enlarged free trade area. However, a slim majority of the Swiss people rejected the EEA in a referendum in December, 1992. Undaunted, the government then undertook a liberalisation programme of its own, and so far it is going well, although the issues treated to date, such as cartel control, do not rouse public sentiments in the way property can. The timing of the parliamentary debate may be propitious. The angry reaction of neighbouring countries to the referendum vote in February to outlaw transit lorries on Alpine passes from 2004 has startled the Swiss. Perhaps they will be more inclined to mollify their neighbours on property rights than they might have been a few months ago. The legal pillar of the liberalisation plan is the replacement of the criterion of nationality with that of residence. A foreigner who is resident in Switzerland or who lived in the country in the past for at least five years would no longer face any restrictions on property purchases. People who live outside but who normally work in the country would no longer have to obtain authorisation to buy a secondary home. For those who do not meet these conditions, the existing holiday home quota scheme would be substantially loosened. The principle of a continually declining national quota would be abolished. The quota would rise from the present 1,420 per year to the maximum 2,000 allowed by Lex Friedrich. If a foreigner who owns a home sells it to another foreigner, that transaction would no longer be counted from the quota. Some foreigners had difficulties getting permission to sell their holiday properties because the local authorities preferred to allot quota to new properties. Similarly, distress sales would be removed from the quota.</p>

			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / No particular Asian cocktail Mr Chris Patten counters his critics in the Hong Kong business world with the argument that the colony's economy cannot prosper after 1997 without some kind of democratic underpinning. He accuses his opponents of appeasement, write Ian Hargreaves and Simon Holberton. 'I think the divide is much more clearly between those who think we should actually stand up for Hong Kong and those who think we shouldn't have a bottom line except to do what China wants,' said the Hong Kong governor. 'But would the business community actually think we'd be better served if I had to spend my time explaining to interested American pension funds, when they come through Hong Kong, how a batch of (undemocratic) arrangements for elections in Hong Kong were really going to enable us to maintain the rule of law and Hong Kong's values after 1997?' In an interview in his office at Government House, Mr Patten argued that democracy and the rule of law are inseparable, disputing the idea that there is a 'particular Asian cocktail' which delivers prosperity without political rights. 'I don't happen to believe that,' he said. 'The notion, which is sometimes advanced by Lee Kuan Yew (former Singapore prime minister) and others, that somehow democracy helps to blunt economic prospects and growth in Asia and elsewhere, doesn't seem to be an argument that is applied very obviously to Japan. Korea and Taiwan are both emerging as much closer to participative multi-party democracies than the sort of benign authoritarianism that existed there before.' An accountable and credible government in Hong Kong would underpin business, not weaken it, he asserted. 'If we agree to rig the election in 1995, that won't produce political stability in Hong Kong in 1997 - anything but - and it is exceptionally short-sighted not to recognise that. Second, it will harm the prospects of the rule of law surviving 1997. I think that would open the door to corruption, I think it would open the door for the flight of capital. If Hong Kong is no different from anywhere else on the (south China) coast, why stay here, why do business here, why give Hong Kong a better credit rating?' Did he not find it remarkable that a former chairman of the UK Conservative party, appointed to the governorship of a colony built on commerce, should be so at odds with the business community? Did this not weaken Britain's negotiating position with Beijing? 'I don't think it makes any difference to our negotiating stance,' said Mr Patten. 'I'd much prefer it if I had the unanimous support of the business community. What I'm delighted about is that I still seem to have substantial support in the community at large. I'd be more worried if everyone in the business community thought I was doing a terrific job and hardly anyone in the community thought I was.'</p>

			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / International Company News: Cost-cutting boosts profits at Exxon EXXON comfortably exceeded market expectations yesterday with third-quarter profits which were bolstered by recent cost-cutting and disposals of assets. The US energy group's 19 per cent rise in net income for the period, compared with the previous year, came against a backdrop of lower oil prices which has held back earnings at other oil companies. 'These strong earnings were generated despite soft worldwide economic conditions, weak crude oil prices, and provisions associated with the tax rate increase in the US,' said Mr Lee Raymond, chairman. Net income for the period rose to Dollars 1.36bn, or Dollars 1.09 a share, from Dollars 1.15bn, or 91 cents, on sales down to Dollars 27.9bn from Dollars 30.6bn. On Wall street, Exxon's shares rose Dollars 1 to close at Dollars 65 1/2 . While exploration and production profits in the US remained flat, at Dollars 273m, overseas earnings in this area jumped to Dollars 549m from Dollars 468m. Atlantic Richfield (Arco) said net income in the third quarter fell to Dollars 68m from Dollars 332m in the previous year due to the increase in the US corporate tax rate and the cost of settling a legal action. The results were held back by an after-tax charge of Dollars 115m resulting from the effect of the tax rate rise on deferred taxes. The company recorded after-tax charges of Dollars 50m against the costs of litigation. These mostly related to the decision by the US Court of Appeals to confirm a judgment against the company in a class action suit over breaches of energy pricing regulations between 1973-1981.</p>

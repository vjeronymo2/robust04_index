			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / As They Say in Europe: Power to the people - a heated debate / France's generation gap LOOKING out at Germany from an aeroplane as I did on Tuesday I was struck by its size - a mere two-thirds that of France with some 20m more people. It has borders with nine other countries. No wonder things get a bit heated down there. This reflection was provoked by the memory that it was three years to the day that I had attended a somewhat tense event which confirmed to me that the removal of the Berlin Wall was not going to do much good. In February 1990, I went to a student meeting that turned rowdy in what was still East Berlin to listen to lectures on the 'social market economy'. The West German government had shipped in lavish pamphlets and politicians whose job it was to demonstrate the delights that awaited the hitherto luckless locals. It would take six months or a year to get things right, people would fall into the new jobs in the service sector and with their high wages and new deutschemarks at one-to-one, the old GDR would boom. The students rightly did not believe it. A couple of months later my employers arranged a seminar on the new Germany where I said the whole thing would be a complete bust and eastern Germany would be a burden to the west, and everybody else, until about 2010. I mention this not because it demonstrates any great forecasting gifts, but because it was obvious to anybody who spent a few days in the country asking people how it worked and finding out that it did not. At the Lindenhof restaurant on Leninstrasse in the Calcutta-style industrial centre of Bitterfeld I asked for a menu at one o'clock and the waitress said, 'Not now. We're having our lunch.' Sitting above Europe at this moment I thought I would have a look at the shape of another ghastly thing to come. In Britain there has been a huge public debate on energy policy. This has touched on the question of French nuclear power which is cheap and when imported into Britain leads to the closure of coalmines. But one interesting thing that emerged from the privatisation of power generation in Britain was that it was impossible to sell nuclear plants to investors because the discounted costs of owning a nuclear plant were greater than the income to be derived from them. In other words, nuclear power is uneconomic and the plants are worthless because of the decommissioning costs. So today Britain has to subsidise its nuclear power in order to sell any. Since there is such a subsidy to domestic supplies, it has to be granted to already cheap French power as well - European Community rules permit no discrimination. (The consequent closure of British coalmines is deplored by large numbers of worthy people who only six months before were demanding that the British government take the initiative at the Rio Summit on the environment by demanding the elimination of greenhouse gasses. Such are the penalties of living in a country where public policy debate is ubiquitous, unceasing and uninformed.) No energy economist has explained to the British public why it is that their nuclear power is too expensive while the French is too cheap. The answer could provide the clue to the next European economic disaster. France relies on nuclear plants for three-quarters of its power generation. This has happened because France is the one working command economy the world has seen. It is organised by graduates of the so-called grandes ecoles. They are brilliant, they possess technical skills of the highest order, they think the same way and they control almost everything. It may sound like a recipe for disaster but the system has worked wonders. Nemesis may emerge in the nuclear power industry where, I assume, electricity is produced cheaply because decommissioning costs have not been included in the price structure. The 80-odd nuclear power stations were built by Electricite de France on borrowed money. The debt stands at FFr195bn (More than Pounds 24bn). The worry is not that there will be a Chernobyl, but that there will be a rumour of one, or something will go a little bit wrong. That would cause hysterics in Germany or Switzerland and even make some Frenchmen doubt the perfection of the original choice. If that happens many will wonder about EdeF debt, which is backed by the state, and think seriously about an investment that cost zillions and might have to be decommissioned and replaced at a cost of tens of zillions. There will be meltdown problem, not nuclear but financial. Maybe there is a simple answer as to why the economics of the French nuclear power industry are totally different from those of the British but nobody has told me. I tried on several occasions to talk to someone at EdeF about this but nobody answered the phone. James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

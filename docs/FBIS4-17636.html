			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 26 TASS -- The Russian State Duma  turned down on Tuesday a proposal of the Liberal Democratic  Party [of Russia -- LDPR] of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy to include  into its agenda the issue of dismissing Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev and special envoy to former Yugoslavia Vitaliy Churkin.    Alexey Mitrofanov from the LDPR proposed that the Duma  discuss "recommendations to the Russian president" on dismissing  the two politicians for "collapse of the Balkan policy of  Russia", a clear reference to the latest Bosnian developments.    Zhirinovskiy, known for his open pro-Serb policy, has often  stated that Kozyrev is the main government member whom he wants  to be sacked.</p>

			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / BBC fee to rise in line with inflation THE GOVERNMENT has granted the BBC a licence fee increase in line with inflation until the corporation's present charter runs out at the end of 1996, Raymond Snoddy writes. The announcement by Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, was influenced by a report on BBC efficiency by consultants Touche Ross. The consultants found that the BBC had pursued opportunities to make savings and efficiency improvements 'in a rigorous and effective' manner. Touche Ross did, however, offer the government a number of licence fee options, including the option for a fee increase below the rise in retail prices for two of the three years involved. Mr Brooke said the settlement would enable the corporation to channel savings into programmes 'and over the next three years allow the BBC steadily to reduce and largely eliminate its annual borrowing'. The decision was welcomed by Mr John Birt, BBC director-general. As a result the colour television licence will rise by 1.8 per cent from April 1 next year, from Pounds 83 to Pounds 84.50.</p>

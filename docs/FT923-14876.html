			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / US Senate approves aid for Moscow THE US Senate on Thursday night approved the Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 570m) assistance package for Russia and its neighbouring republics, which is the cornerstone of the international effort to promote market democracies in the former Soviet Union. The House of Representatives is expected to consider equivalent legislation later this month. The convincing margin of the Senate vote makes its approval more likely. The US contribution to the international aid package had appeared in doubt prior to the visit here last month of President Boris Yeltsin of Russia, the high point of which was his powerful speech to a joint session of Congress. Until then, congressional sentiment had been in favour of first spending scant resources on US economic needs. In the event, the Senate passed its bill by 76 to 20, with only a handful of insignificant amendments tacked on for domestic political purposes. Simultaneously addressing internal concerns on Thursday, the House passed its version of the urban aid bill and both chambers approved an extension of emergency unemployment benefits. President George Bush had lobbied hard for passage of the Russian aid bill, which includes authorisation for an additional US contribution to the International Monetary Fund and for the proposed rouble stabilisation fund. The Senate action will help the president when he meets Mr Yeltsin at the end of the G7 summit in Munich next week. Also on Thursday, the Senate foreign relations committee gave Russia its pat on the back by approving last year's Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (Start), negotiated with the former Soviet Union and subsequently amended to take account of new political realities.</p>

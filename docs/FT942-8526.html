			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Bentsen argues for caution in drive to police derivatives Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, yesterday warned the US Congress against 'interfering in markets in too heavy handed a way' in its efforts to regulate more closely the risks posed by trading in financial derivatives. The warning came as congressional committees began to chew over the findings of a report by the General Accounting Office, Congress's audit agency, which warned of gaps in the supervision of derivatives dealing, especially by securities business affiliates and insurance companies. Mr Edward Markey, chairman of the House of Representatives subcommittee on telecommunications and finance, said the GAO report had 'identified some serious gaps in the current legal and regulatory structure relating to derivatives,' and argued that regulatory and legislative reforms were needed 'to successfully avert the potential for a future derivatives Dunkirk.' In the light of the findings, he said, 'I cannot agree with those who would argue that the thousand points of light of industry volunteerism and a few incremental changes by regulators can effectively address the risks posed by exotic derivatives.' Mr Henry Gonzalez, House banking committee chairman, said he saw 'eye-to-eye with the GAO report on the need for increased disclosure, for improved supervision and for stronger international co-operation on derivatives regulation and supervision' Mr Gonzalez said he planned soon to introduce derivatives legislation in co-operation with Congressman Jim Leach, his Republican counterpart. Republican members of Mr Markey's subcommittee yesterday took immediate aim at some of the proposals in the GAO report, warning they ran the risk of meddling in normal company decisions that were no business of government. 'In the process of protecting stockholders from the consequences of bad business decisions in derivatives, we need to make sure that we don't drive companies to foreign derivatives markets, said Congressman Dennis Hastert of Illinois. Even some Democrats feared they might end up mollycoddling multinational companies well able to handle the complexities of derivatives.</p>

			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> LABOR DEPT. ORDERS SAFETY LOCKS ON PLANT MACHINERY  </P> <P> The federal government Thursday gave 631,000 factories and plants two months to  install locks so that power to machinery is cut off during maintenance and  repairs, a step the Labor Department said will save 120 lives a year.  </P> <P> The department said the new rule will affect 39 million American workers, most  of them in manufacturing and service industries, and estimated that it will  also prevent 60,000 injuries a year, 28,000 of them serious, such as loss of  limbs or crushed bones.  </P> <P> It will cost the affected establishments $214 million in the next year for the  necessary equipment and training and $135 million in subsequent years, the  department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration said. Those costs  will range from $120 for small establishments -- such as a small print shop --  to $28,000 for large plants with scores of machines, OSHA said.  </P> <P> The regulation, 10 years in the making, is tougher in its final form than when  it was proposed.  </P> <P> At first, the government proposed requiring that employers either install locks  or place warning tags on the power source to alert workers that the machinery  was being worked on and was not to be activated.  </P> <P> But the final rule released Thursday places far greater emphasis on locks,  allowing tags only when an employer can prove that equipment cannot be "locked"  or that its tag program is as effective as locks.  </P> <P> "We have so many fatalities, loss of fingers, crushed bones and other serious  injuries because these precautions are not taken," said Alan McMillan, acting  chief of OSHA. "This will have a major effect on workplace safety."  </P> <P> Joseph Kinney, executive director of the National Safe Workplace Institute, a  nonprofit job safety organization that has been bitterly critical of OSHA in  the past, praised the issuance of the new rule.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Standard's Applications  </P> <P> The standard applies to most machinery used in manufacturing and in services  such as industrial laundries. OSHA data shows that packaging and wrapping  equipment, printing presses and conveyors account for a high proportion of  accidents blamed on a failure to cut off power during major maintenance and  repairs.  </P></p>

			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / International Company News: Brown and Tawse plans will leave Pounds 20m loss A FAR-REACHING management shake-up and a restructuring plan costing more than Pounds 12m that will push losses in the year just ending to almost Pounds 20m was announced yesterday by Brown and Tawse Group, the troubled steel and pipes distributor. Mr Gilbert Black, chairman for more than five years, is standing down, along with Mr Edwin Hartley, managing director of Brown and Tawse Ltd, the core company. The new non-executive chairman is Mr Donald McFarlane, chairman of Senior Engineering and James Dickie. Mr Richard Wilson, who joined as group chief executive from GKN last year, is also to take over day-to-day charge of Brown and Tawse Ltd and has brought in Mr Richard Hunt from Courage and Mr Robin Gigsby from GKN to head the group's logistics and commercial operations. The company said it was expecting a pre-tax loss for the year to March 28, 1993, of around Pounds 19.8m, the third year in a row the group has shown a loss. An Pounds 8.9m trading loss was expected, after charges for a business review and nearly Pounds 2m in increased stock and debtor provisions. Other exceptional charges will total Pounds 10.9m, including Pounds 5m to cover writing off an information systems infrastructure installed at Brown and Tawse Ltd only four years ago, but which is now deemed inappropriate. Mr Wilson said the group would now focus on Brown and Tawse Ltd, which would be heavily restructured.</p>

			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / N Sea project brought forward BRITISH Petroleum is expected to announce plans today to go ahead with a project for eight or nine oil and gas fields in the central North Sea, Deborah Hargreaves writes. The Eastern Trough Area Project, involving eight companies including Shell and Esso, is to go forward sooner than planned because of changes to the oil tax regime proposed in the Budget. It is expected to cost Pounds 600m to Pounds 1bn to bring the fields into production by 1998. They are believed to contain between 600m and 1bn barrels of oil and more than 1,000bn cu ft of gas.</p>

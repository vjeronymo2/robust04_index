			<p><P> April 9, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ESCONDIDO MAYORAL HOPEFUL LEADS WATER CRUSADE;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: SLOW-GROWTH COUNCILMAN JERRY HARMON WANTS TO RECYCLE SEWAGE,  CONVERT IT TO DOLLARS AND REVIVE NEARBY AGRICULTURE AT THE SAME TIME.  </P> <P> Jerry Harmon looks like a typical middle-management type in his proper blue  suits, white shirts and conservative ties. But, beneath that button-down  exterior, he's a revolutionary who is about to turn Escondido around and march  it back to its youth.  </P> <P> The Escondido city councilman has a plan to convert the city's sewage into a  cash crop that will give Escondido $1 million to $2 million a year to spend on  acquiring land on the city's fringes and elsewhere, land where orchards and  citrus groves again can thrive as they did a century ago. Only this time on  reclaimed water.  </P> <P> Harmon concedes that it may appear that his plan is too good to be true. His  critics say it is.  </P> <P> His plan is to convert waste into dollars by purifying the city's sewage water  and treating it to a point that it can be used for everything but drinking.  This commodity, which Escondido now discharges down a pipeline and into the  ocean off Cardiff, could bring in millions of dollars if sold to farmers at  cut-rate prices, Harmon contends.  </P> <P> Those dollars would be used to acquire more land -- both inside and outside the  city -- to create a greenbelt similar to those around European cities. But,  more important, it could halt the urban development which is slowly spreading  from the valley floor up into the foothills that surround the inland North  County community.  </P> <P> "I looked at a satellite photograph of the Los Angeles basin and saw  'suburbia.' If you could see that map, you would know what suburbia means,"  Harmon said. "From 450 miles up, there is not a speck of green. It is  completely urbanized. You can't tell where one city ends and the next begins.  Even the Los Angeles River is a concrete ditch."  </P> <P> San Diego County, on the other hand, still has undeveloped land, especially  inland. Harmon has set out to save what's left from the developer's earthmovers  because Harmon is an environmentalist and a slow-growth advocate.  </P> <P> "If we use the income stream from sale of reclaimed water to buy up as much  vacant land as we possibly can, we keep it out of the free marketplace and  prevent developers from speculating on it," he explained. Otherwise, without  public land acquisition, water reclamation would be growth-inducing by  providing additional supplies of that finite commodity, he said.  </P> <P> For every gallon of reclaimed water produced for irrigation or flushing  toilets, a gallon of potable water is saved, he explained. "I looked at this  carefully and concluded that it would hurt me (by providing water for  additional development), unless we follow through and take a vital commodity  for development -- land -- out of the marketplace," he said.  </P> <P> "We're not trying to plow new ground here," Harmon said. "We are trying to  catch up with what has started elsewhere."  </P> <P> Monterey has been reclaiming sewage water for years, as have other Northern  California communities, Harmon said. A series of water reclamation plants at  Whittier, Pomona, Long Beach, Cerritos and Whitter Narrows cleanses huge  quantities of sewage water for use by industry, he points out.  </P> <P> For 14 years, Harmon sat on the five-member Escondido City Council as the lone  vote against annexations and development while the city doubled in population.  Then, two years ago, two like-minded council members were elected and, as  Harmon put it, "now I'm leading the parade." And he is leading it back to a  slower-paced, environmentally sensitive lifestyle.  </P> <P> Now he is convinced he has found a way to make his environmentalist ideas pay.  </P> <P> "This plan not only makes good environmental sense, it makes good business  sense, too," Harmon explained. "The Chamber of Commerce (not one of Harmon's  backers) is always saying that government should be run in a more businesslike  way. And, that is what I am proposing: to preserve a precious commodity --  water -- and make money in the process."  </P> <P> Harmon has a report from an independent engineering firm that found that  Escondido can use all of its reclaimed water within the city boundaries. The  Engineering Sciences report also found that the cost of creating new reservoirs  and miles of dual piping to distribute the reclaimed water is economically  feasible.  </P> <P> "Business people, including my loyal opposition all these years, Jim Rady, are  going to see the good sense of this plan," Harmon said. "But when Rady first  hears of this, he is going to hit the ceiling. If, in two, three, four years  down the road, he has a plurality elected to the council like I did, he will  have a tough time overturning what I am going to put in place for him to  enjoy."  </P> <P> To Rady, the former Escondido mayor who did not run for reelection in the 1988  when Harmon's star rose, the plan to turn the city's sewage into an income  stream is "anything but realistic." If it were such a good deal, Rady said,  "then everyone would have done it by now."  </P> <P> Rady views Harmon's plan as a ruse to prevent the much-needed expansion of the  city's ocean outfall off Cardiff, a needed expansion to handle increased sewage  flow expected from Escondido.  </P> <P> "If he can convince people that he is going to reduce the city's sewage flow  down to the outfall to a trickle so that the expansion isn't needed, he will  have an effective weapon to stop growth and development in this city," Rady  said. "I think that's his primary goal."  </P> <P> Former City Councilman Doug Best, who is running against Harmon in the first  direct election for mayor in June, also questions Harmon's motives. He contends  that Harmon is advancing the water reclamation plan to curry favor with "the  coastal voters" in preparation for a bid for a state Assembly seat.  </P> <P> Rady concedes that reclamation is a good idea. When he ran the city before the  slow-growth troika headed by Harmon took over, the council was looking at a  deal to sell millions of gallons of its sewage water to a neighboring sewage  district, which would treat it and use it on golf courses and landscaping.  </P> <P> It was that deal and the immediate need to expand the ocean outfall that got  Harmon moving on his water reclamation plan.  </P> <P> "If others were willing to pay us for something we are just throwing away down  a pipeline to the ocean, then it only makes sense that we do the same thing  here," he explained.  </P> <P> Harmon said he has talked to environmental groups along the coast about his  idea to reduce Escondido sewage flows off their ocean beaches rather than to  enlarge the outfall and has found them very receptive.  </P> <P> "The point is to quit alienating the people on the coast. We can do that by  reducing the amount of effluent we dump into the ocean," Harmon said. "I am  saying to them, 'Don't sue us,' which I think they have the right to do, for  one reason because we dump our waste without removing the viruses and bacteria.  It's bound to have an effect on tourism, which is their lifeblood on the  coast."  </P> <P> Escondido had planned to expand its ocean outfall capacity -- a $7 million  project -- but coastal residents are demanding that the city extend its outfall  to the edge of the Continental Shelf -- a $24 million task -- to prevent  contamination of the recreational waters offshore and the beaches.  </P> <P> Environmental groups, although lauding Harmon's water reclamation plan, believe  it is too little and too late.  </P> <P> Escondido's sewage flows are increasing dangerously to near capacity of its  land pipeline and ocean outfall, said David Winkler of the San Elijo Lagoon  Conservancy, producing sewage spills that have contaminated ocean shellfish and  degraded the quality of the lagoon environment.  </P> <P> To continue to cause major environmental damage to the lagoon and ocean while  implementing an untested water reclamation project is not an acceptable  alternative to Winkler because it leaves the short-term possibility of  land-line failures, which would pollute San Elijo Lagoon, and more ocean  pollution from increased sewage flows through the ocean outfall.  </P> <P> Winkler and Richard McManus, an attorney and spokesman for People for a Clean  Ocean, say the problem has not yet reached the lawsuit stage.  </P> <P> "Personally, I think he (Harmon) is a very earnest man, and I support his plan  wholeheartedly," McManus said. But he is not sure that the reclamation project  will resolve the problems that Escondido sewage is causing the coast.  </P> <P> Even if Escondido city leaders are intent on reclaiming the city's sewage  instead of dumping it in the ocean, there are other levels of bureaucracy to be  hurdled, including the Regional Water Quality Control Board, and other state  and federal water and environmental watchdog groups, McManus noted.  </P> <P> Sam Blick, a friend of Harmon and attorney for a number of developers,  acknowledges that the far-reaching reclamation plan is "a wonderful concept,"  but echoes the reactions of others that it seems too good to be true.  </P> <P> "I don't have enough information about it to determine if it will work or not,  but it is a fantastic concept," Blick said. "However, I have no evidence that  it would be profitable."  </P> <P> However, San Diego County is entitled legally to only a small portion of its  current supply of imported water, Blick pointed out, and the guarantee of an  uninterrupted water supply for land might boost the value of that land to a  level that would make such an ambitious reclamation effort economically viable.  </P> <P> Roger Frauenfelder, deputy San Diego city manager who is handling that city's  plans to recycle at least half its sewage flows by the year 2010, has a problem  with Harmon's financial analysis.  </P> <P> Even with federal grants and other subsidies, purifying sewage water to federal  standards is expensive, far more costly than importing water, Frauenfelder  said. He estimated that treatment and distribution costs for recycled water  would be about $630 an acre-foot. That contrasts with a $250 to $300 an  acre-foot cost for imported potable water in the foreseeable future.  </P> <P> Frank Dudek, a principal in the engineering firm of Dudek &amp; Associates, who  specializes in water reclamation, raises an eyebrow at the prospect of profits  from Escondido's sewage recycling project, but wholeheartedly supports Harmon's  efforts to initiate it.  </P> <P> He has done water plans for Poway, Carlsbad and other North County communities  and finds that "some look good and some look bad" in water-reclamation  projects.  </P> <P> The trend is for increasing constraints on imported water, higher costs for  importing water and more restrictive regulations by state and federal agencies  on the quality of water discharges, Dudek explained.  </P> <P> He predicted a time, not too distant, when Escondido and other inland cities  will be required to treat their sewage to tertiary levels -- the levels Harmon  is now proposing -- before it can be dumped into the ocean, or anywhere else  for that matter.  </P> <P> "If you are going to have to treat it to that extent anyway, then why pour it  down the drain?," Dudek asked. "Escondido is just a step ahead in the process  and, because of its location and surrounding (undeveloped) lands, I think it  has a better shot at water reclamation than some more urbanized areas."  </P> <P> Harmon said he is looking for feedback, for criticism that might reveal any  chinks in his plan. He is also confident that he can amend the reclamation  program to meet any criticisms.  </P> <P> The first complaint he expected to hear was that he planned to acquire large  tracts of property as public land, taking them off the tax rolls and causing  budgetary crises in affected cities, school districts and other governmental  agencies. Harmon has an answer for that one:  </P> <P> "We would lease out a certain amount of these public lands for agricultural or  recreational uses. Then we would use a portion of the lease revenues to keep  (property) tax revenues up to at least present levels."  </P> <P> Leasing of the property he plans to acquire would have a double benefit by  providing subsidies to replace lost tax revenues and by assuring customers for  Escondido's reclaimed water.  </P> <P> "We would require lessees to buy a certain amount of reclaimed water as a  condition of their leases," Harmon said. "And, in return, we would provide them  with a guaranteed supply of water during the term of their long-term lease.  </P> <P> "In Southern California, where water is like 'liquid gold,' a guaranteed supply  of water is a very valuable asset," Harmon said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Gaza -- Major General Nasr Yusuf, commander of  the Palestinian national security forces in the Gaza Strip, has  affirmed that no agreement has yet been reached with Hamas,  because we insist on the surrender of those who murdered two  citizens the day before yesterday. We have informed the party  to which they belong about this.    He emphasized again that the security forces will pursue  anyone who kidnaps or harasses any citizen or who tampers with  the security of the citizens. There is only one Authority in  the Gaza Strip, and this Authority has been entrusted with  safeguarding the security of the citizens and punishing those  who violate the law.    Asked whether an ultimatum has been given to these parties,  he explained that the responsible party has been officially  requested to hand over those who carried out the killing, and we  will pursue the murderers. It would be important to us and to  them if they hand over the murderers, he said. [passage omitted]</p>

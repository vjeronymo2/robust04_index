			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Observer: Olympian struggles The hunt is on for a chief executive of the Sydney Olympic Games organising committee; but Rod McGeoch, a 47-year-old Sydney lawyer, couldn't care less. That's odd, because McGeoch led Sydney's successful September bid to host the games in the year 2000. McGeoch is cheesed off at lack of official recognition for those who worked on the bid; he has walked out. There have been other hiccups too. John Fahey, the New South Wales premier, has incurred some ire for having snatched responsibility for the games from Bruce Baird, NSW transport minister. Baird had done most of the work in the bid run-up. Then there are the rumours of a 'budget blowout', euphemistically disguising possible capital expenditure excesses. Finally, John Valder, the bid's main fundraiser, claims he has been kicked off the organising committee's board because no-one had remembered to appoint a woman. The first task of the new chief executive will be to engender a little more jeu d'esprit amongst the organisers.</p>

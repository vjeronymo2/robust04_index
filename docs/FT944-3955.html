			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Norweb claims PowerGen rejected plant approach Norweb, the regional electricity company, yesterday claimed PowerGen had rejected its approach to buy plant which it must sell to meet the industry regulators' demands for increased competition. The news comes just a day after Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator, expressed impatience with the two main generators over their progress on plant disposals. National Power and PowerGen have been ordered to sell between 5,000MW and 6,000MW of generating capacity before the end of next year. Mr Ken Harvey, Norweb's chairman and chief executive, said at the company's interim results meeting that he had approached PowerGen in conjunction with other 'potential generators'. 'PowerGen told us they did not wish to proceed any further,' Mr Harvey said. 'They said they had other options.' PowerGen denied it had rejected Norweb outright. The generator had decided initially to pursue options with potential European partners. 'Options include asset swaps or potential joint venture arrangements,' the company said. 'We have made it clear that the priority at the moment is to pursue proposals with European parties, but we have not ruled out other options.' Mr Harvey said Norweb was talking to National Power about the possible acquisition of plant. Mr Harvey's comments came as the group announced a 19 per cent jump in pre-tax profits to Pounds 77.5m (Pounds 65.1m) in the six months to September 30. Sales were up 5 per cent to Pounds 677.3m. Norweb also announced it was reducing its standing charge to domestic customers by Pounds 1.50 to Pounds 9.34 a quarter. This means prices to domestic customers have fallen by about Pounds 25 a year, including the 6 per cent tariff cut in April. These reductions more than offset the 8 per cent VAT charge, Mr Harvey said. The distribution business increased operating profits by 5 per cent to Pounds 62.5m, while supply profits jumped from Pounds 4.2m to Pounds 13.3m. The interim dividend was increased to 8.2p (6.7p). Earnings rose from 27.1p to 33.9p. COMMENT These were strong results and the underlying growth in the distribution business is even better than it appears. Profits there were held back by provisions for the restructuring which will further enhance the utility's performance. The only real question over Norweb now is the decision to expand the retailing division. This is likely to leave the market with a certain degree of unease for the immediate future. Forecasts are for profits of about Pounds 196m. The forecast dividend of more than 27p leaves Norweb with a prospective yield of about 4.4 per cent. On that basis, the shares appear to be fairly valued.</p>

			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets: Indian foreign initiative reaps limited rewards - A disappointing inflow of orders India's securities scandal is only one reason why, nine months since the market was opened to foreign portfolio investment, there has been a flood of enquiries but no big inflow of orders. So far, less than Dollars 20m has come in, disappointing the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the market watchdog which also keeps track of capital flows. For decades, foreigners were kept out of India, by official fiat; and last September, when foreign investors were given permission to hold up to 5 per cent of quoted Indian companies, they were discouraged by archaic trading practices, and share prices which moved more on rumours than on facts and fundamentals. No official target was set for foreign involvement. The authorities in New Delhi were hoping for Dollars 2bn in foreign direct capital inflow, including Dollars 1bn of portfolio investment, this year; but even this objective is proving as tough as Mount Everest to scale. Mr Stephen Barnes, at the Bombay office of BZW, says: 'One should talk of hundreds of millions, not billions', for the next couple of years. It will be a long haul at this rate for overseas investors to reach their 5 per cent quota, which works out to Rp58bn (Dollars 1.84bn), taking the market capitalisation of the top half of the 650 companies listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange. Foreign fund managers have had a lot of bad news to contend with. Early last December they were pondering the outbreak of communal riots, triggered by the destruction of the Babri mosque at Ayodhya. Subsequent events have included pre-budget blues in February; a series of bomb blasts on March 12, which upset commercial activity in major Indian cities; and, finally, the bombshell dropped last month by Mr Harshad Mehta, the stockbroker at the centre of India's Rp50bn securities scandal, alleging a Rp10m pay-off to Mr PV Narisimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, who denied the accusation. The stock market has reacted bearishly. The BSE 30-share index hit its 14-month low of 2,036 at the end of April, down by 55 per cent from the peak of 4,500 a year ago. A ban on short sales by BSE authorities last month took the bears' teeth away, but share prices have since moved in a narrow range, the index closing yesterday at 2,187.81 after a downward flutter on Monday. Foreign investors now have a feel for the environment. They are able to identify quite a few companies with price/earnings multiples of less than 25, and this makes an attractive change. The market was governed until recently by Mr Mehta's theory that p/e ratios were less important in valuing companies than the cost of replacing existing assets. On this basis, ACC, India's biggest cement producer, was bought up to Rp10,000 in April 1992. It is now down to a realistic Rp1,660 and a p/e of just under 19. Fundamentals have improved. Inflation is running at a six-year low of 5.8 per cent per annum; and interest rates at commercial banks are down by 2 percentage points over the past four months and are poised to fall further. Monsoon rains this season so far have been timely, and evenly spread throughout the country. If the weathermen's predictions come true, agricultural production will see strong growth, laying the foundation for a sharp rise in gross national product this year. The stock market has now focused on around half a dozen companies with strong fundamentals, such as ICICI, the finance house, Great Eastern Shipping, SCICI (basically shipping finance) and the Housing Development Finance Corporation, all of which are in the p/e range of 9 to 17. Foreigners have devised a dual strategy, testing the market with small orders and then striking bilateral deals with local institutional investors. 'It is possible to get discounts on large orders,' says Mr Barnes, justifying the bilateral approach. On the sell side, the Unit Trust of India is interested in selling part of its portfolio because it needs to generate Rp50bn in cash to service dividends in July. Mr P Sankaran, of Ind-Global Financial Services, expects the tempo of foreign portfolio investment to accelerate over the next two months, if there is no major setback to the equity market over the same period. 'The immediate problem,' emphasises Mr Sankaran, 'is political stability.'</p>

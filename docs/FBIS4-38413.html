			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Dmitriy Kamyshev report: "Regional Policy in New </F> Conditions. Regions Combat Moscow and Bad Weather"]    [Text] The changing weather of May meant continuous  troubles for the organizers of the "Federalism And Interethnic  Relations in Modern Russia" conference that ended in the "Forest  Vistas" [Lesnyye Dali] guest house near Moscow Saturday. First,  owing to the sudden spell of cool weather and other state  affairs, Ivan Rybkin and Sergey Filatov could not make it to the  conference. Second, the participants in the conference, whom the  inclement weather drove under the roof of the main building of  the guest house, started to show marked boredom by the end of  the first day and started to slip away.    Even despite the absence of the heads of the State Duma and  the President's Staff, however, it was full house during the  first plenary sitting, with Sergey Shakhray, who had not been  permitted to quit [as vice premier] the day before, appearing on  the panel apparently as an attraction. The vice premier, who  presented a paper [doklad] on the problems of federalism in  Russia, expressed the conviction that the main problem is a  contradiction between the ethnic and territorial principle of  the state's construction (the "asymmetrical" nature of the  federation), and he once again lauded the treaty with Tataria  [Tatarstan] whose model, in Shakhray's words, is quite  applicable in Crimea, the Dniester Region, and Karabakh. The  vice premier also complained that market relations in conditions  of weakness of federal authorities increase regional  disproportions, and declared for regulation of prices of energy  and shipping by rail.    Shakhray's speech provided the point of departure for the  conference participants, who had come, according to its  organizers, from 66 federation components. Remarkably, the  number of critics of the "May Theses" [Shakhray's keynote  address, paralleled with Lenin's "April Theses"] was greater  than of those who went along with them. For example, Ramazan  Abdulatipov, Federation Council vice speaker, deemed the signing  of separate agreements with federation components to be  incorrect, while delegates from the republics did not like the  idea of a gradual transition to a territorial structure of the  federation.    Despite the cool weather outside the window, especially  heated debates flared up during the second day of work at the  sittings of the sections and "roundtables." In the course of  the discussion the participants divided in two big distinct  groups: representatives of the republics, who demolished the  new Constitution, which should never have been passed in a  referendum, and those who were demanding that the Federation  Treaty be religiously observed and suggested that separate  agreements be signed with all who would like to sign them.  Delegates of the krays and oblasts (supported by Moscow  politicians and academics) tried to persuade the "republicans"  not to hurt ethnic Russians, to give up the idea of sovereignty  and remake their constitutions as Moscow is asking for. At the  end, everyone remained of the same opinion, agreeing only that  the State Duma, 40 percent of whose members are Muscovites,  cannot reflect the regions' interests adequately.</p>

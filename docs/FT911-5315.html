			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / International Company News: US court decision on Laidlaw lawsuit A New York court will decide today whether to allow Laidlaw and ADT to speed up proceedings under the lawsuit brought by the Canadian waste management company as part of its efforts to force greater disclosure of ADT's affairs. Laidlaw, the biggest shareholder, is seeking various injunctions against ADT relating to disclosure of the Bermuda-based company's financial condition and alleged violations of US securities laws. By proceeding directly to the discovery stage, Laidlaw hopes the case can be finalised before the scheduled reconvening on June 3 of a special ADT meeting in Bermuda. Laidlaw used its 28.4 per cent shareholding earlier this month to force adjournment of the meeting, which was to consider three ADT proposals opposed by the Canadian company. The fate of the lawsuit has become a central element in negotiations between Mr Donald Jackson, Laidlaw chief executive, and Mr Michael Ashcroft, chairman of ADT, to settle the differences between the two companies. Mr Jackson told analysts in Toronto on Friday that Laidlaw will review the value of its stake over the next few months to determine whether a writedown is appropriate. In a filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Laidlaw said the market value was about USDollars 400m, less on February 28 than the carrying value of Dollars 950m. Mr Jackson said Laidlaw was unable to develop a strategy for its stake until it had a 'better understanding' of the state of affairs at the security and car auction company. Meantime, it was keeping all options open, including adding to or cutting its interest. He added that ADT's earnings were expected to fall by 5-15 per cent this year largely as a result of a decline in income from unspecified non-operating sources. ADT last month reported a 22 per cent drop in 1990 earnings. As for Laidlaw's own businesses, Mr Jackson acknowledged that North American waste disposal had turned out to be more sensitive to the business cycle than was previously thought.</p>

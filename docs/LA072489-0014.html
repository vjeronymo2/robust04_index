			<p><P> July 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES : THELONIOUS MONSTER'S LOVABLE LOUDMOUTH  </P> <P> Sometimes it looked as if Thelonious Monster's Bob Forrest could hardly wait  for a song to end so he could start talking during Friday's concert at the  Palace. Not that he shortchanged the music, but really, there's all this stuff  going on. Can you believe the Dodgers? Is anybody actually going to pay money  to see the Who and the Stones? The Palace is OK, but don't mess with the  bouncers. Guess what my kid did today? Forrest also discoursed on his career,  his girlfriend and Michael Jordan; made fun of Tone Loc, and got some girls to  join the guys in stage-diving.  </P> <P> Forrest is the David Lee Roth of L.A.'s street-rock set: different values, but  still the lovable loudmouth. Like Roth, he's both hero and pal to his audience,  taking them through days they recognize and share. They're days of staying one  step ahead -- borrowing $20, going to the bank and the 7-Eleven, making the  gig.  </P> <P> This quintet isn't just attitude: "So What if I Did" is simply one of the best  songs to ever come out of the L.A. rock scene. With the players hitting Byrds  and Love L.A. rock grooves and then cranking up a punkish, bluesish blur with  the wall-of-pain power of old Crazy Horse, Thelonious Monster is making a fair  bid to join Mott the Hoople in the Glorious Failure Hall of Fame.RICHARD  CROMELIN  </P></p>

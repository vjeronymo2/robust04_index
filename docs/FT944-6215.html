			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Their Budget): Superstore manager Richard Woodall, 29: general manager of the Norwich branch of Asda. Married with two small children. Earns: Pounds 38,000 plus car. Politics: 'Staunch' Tory. Wanted: From a personal point of view, no increase in petrol duty. Hoped for a generous budget which would return consumer confidence. Said yesterday: The cuts in public spending mean there can probably be tax cuts next year. From a business point of view it probably means at Asda we are going to have the lowest-cost Christmas in relative terms since 1966.</p>

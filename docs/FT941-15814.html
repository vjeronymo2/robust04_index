The other members of the management team are Geoff Green, Vic Luck, Anyas Morse, Pat Sherry and Peter Hazell, who takes responsibility for Smith's previous role for London operations. Richard Stone, the fourth candidate for the Coopers' chair, will not be part of the team, but remains head of the firm's corporate finance practice. Roger Davis, head of audit, accounting and advisory practice, is supported by an executive partner, Ed Smith. Vic Luck replaces Malcolm Coster as head of management consultancy.

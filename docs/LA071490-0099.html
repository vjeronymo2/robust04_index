			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> 8,000 JOBS MAY BE LOST TO SAVE OWL  </P> <P> Reconsidering the extent of its decision earlier this week, the state  Department of Forestry said as many as 8,000 jobs may be lost when it expands  protection of spotted-owl habitat to private lands.  </P> <P> The rules, similar to those regulating national forests, originally were  expected to cost no more than 1,900 jobs. The rules forbid logging that damages  owl nests or reduces owl habitat. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service recently  declared the northern spotted owl, which lives in valuable old-growth forests,  to be threatened with extinction because of heavy logging. This forced the  state to take measures to protect the bird.  </P></p>

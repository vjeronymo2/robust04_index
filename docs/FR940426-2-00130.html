			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary shall propose or implement rules governing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities under this Act only in accordance with this section except for routine matters and matters having no significant impact. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary's most recent semi-annual agenda of rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities was published on October 25, 1993 (58 FR 56632). As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the agenda indicates, it was based on reports submitted by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department's initiating offices in July 1993, five months prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the publication of the Notice and well before the agency had  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formulated its proposal. We do not believe that the publication  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement serves to foreclose FTA's ability to proceed with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposals to amend rules or guidance that were developed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsequent to the most recently published agenda and prior to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the next. Moreover, as the agenda itself notes, its purpose is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to ``enable the public to be more aware of and allow it to more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effectively participate in the Department's regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activity.'' This objective has been clearly met, as an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extraordinarily large number of commenters have participated in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this proceeding. FTA has complied with the public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation requirement by providing prior notice and a 60-day  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public comment period. FTA believes that in this proceeding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it has met the requirements of section 12(i).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters in particular objected to the path FTA has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> followed, arguing that FTA should instead conduct a rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proceeding under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5 U.S.C. 553, that would entail a notice of proposed rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and provide for public comment. FTA finds this essentially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> semantical argument to be without merit. These commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identified no procedural defects in the process FTA has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> followed, nor did they assert any prejudice to their ability to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meaningfully participate. In short, these commenters simply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> argue that FTA's action is legally defective because it titled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its November notice, ``Notice of Proposed Recision *&blank;*&blank;*,''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instead of ``Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.'' FTA believes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> since it has followed the notice and comment procedure of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 12(i), the labels used are irrelevant. We note also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that, although the APA requires prior notice and comment, that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement does not apply to a matter relating to a Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grant program. 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The objection of these commenters would have been more valid in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the context of the process used to adopt the current policies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1984 and 1986, FTA did not provide prior notice and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity for comment. If these commenters believed the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policies then issued in final form without prior notice or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment to constitute a ``binding norm,'' they could have gone to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> court asserting the consequent invalidity of the 1984/1986  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the past, FTA has issued guidance in the form of statements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of policy and circulars. For example, FTA has issued circulars  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressing third-party procurement, cross-border leasing, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suspension and debarment. Thus, FTA's 1984/1986 guidance was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with its general practice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Even if FTA wanted to use the label favored by these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters_thus agreeing that action to rescind the 1984/1986  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidance constitutes rulemaking_it would have faced a certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> awkwardness. Issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking to propose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the amendment of a rule generally refers to something codified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the Code of Federal Regulations. Here, no such target  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exists; accordingly, FTA judged that a proposal to rescind the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current nonregulatory guidance, especially when providing prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice and comment, would be appropriate and would adequately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> serve the evident public interest in this issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Objections Based on the Record&hyph;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters argued that the Notice fails to state a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rationale for recision of the guidance and is thus legally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> defective. They cited  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> State Farm Mutual Insurance, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  463 U.S. 29, 42 (1983), in which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Court held that ``an agency changing its course by rescinding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a rule is obligated to supply a reasoned analysis for the change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beyond that which may be required when an agency acts in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first instance.'' They pointed out that FTA based its proposal,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in part, on its belief that some grant recipients have found  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elements of the policy to be burdensome. They noted that in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> response to a request for documents under the Freedom of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Information Act, FTA produced few such written grantee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complaints. They concluded that FTA has acted in an arbitrary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and capricious manner, since it has not supplied the ``reasoned  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis for the change'' required by  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> State Farm.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We note, however, that elsewhere in State Farm, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  which involved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recision of a passive restraint requirement for automobiles, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Court stated: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Recision of the passive restraint requirement would not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arbitrary and capricious simply because there was no evidence in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> direct support of the agency's conclusion. It is not infrequent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the available data do not settle a regulatory issue, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the agency must then exercise its judgment in moving from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facts and probabilities on the record to a policy conclusion.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &hyph;&hyph;&hyph;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=3 --> Id.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> at 44. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The question, then, is not whether FTA has evidence in support  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of its belief that grantees find the current policy burdensome.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Indeed, the Court invalidated NHTSA's finding that the passive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restraint requirement was unnecessary not because it lacked  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supporting evidence, but because there was substantial evidence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to contradict that finding. Moreover,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> State Farm <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  involved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review of a final rule, and no court has held that an agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> proposal <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is somehow invalid for lack of a sufficient record.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FTA believes that the record it has developed in this proceeding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fully supports the action it is here announcing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / County NatWest break-up begins COUNTY NatWest, the ill-fated investment banking arm of National Westminster, is to be broken up and its operations submerged within the NatWest group, it emerged yesterday. The move spells the end of NatWest's dream at the time of Big Bang six years ago to create a free-standing, full-service investment bank. However, NatWest said that County's operations would continue under the umbrella of NatWest Markets, provided they could generate adequate profits. The bank will decide before the year-end whether to keep parts of the business in separate legal entities, or whether to bring it all on to NatWest's own balance sheet. Mr Derek Wanless, NatWest chief executive, said that the enlarged NatWest Markets division would bring together all of the group's services for large companies and institutional investment clients. The division will also oversee lending to the group's 800 largest corporate customers around the world. By centralising all financial markets operations, NatWest hopes to make considerable savings on back office activities. Mr Wanless said no decision had yet been made on how many of the 1,500 back office staff would lose their jobs, but he hoped the new division would expand and eventually create new jobs. NatWest Markets was set up in January this year. It is backed by Pounds 3bn of the group's capital and employs 5,000 people. NatWest plans to promote its branding strongly in the financial markets, while County will be reduced to a secondary branding on some of its products. A decision will be made over the next six months on whether to retain County as a brand name for parts of NatWest's operations. County's equities division, which has been the cause of its poor performance, is to be run as a separate unit alongside NatWest's treasury division. Besides saving on costs, this will enable the group to make better use of County's equity research unit, said Mr Martin Owen, who has been appointed head of the enlarged markets division. Other parts of County will remain under the direct control of Mr John Drury, who will now report straight to Mr Owen. Lex, Page 22; Observer, Page 21</p>

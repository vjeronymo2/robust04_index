(``Bayer'') in this civil antitrust proceeding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> I <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> Nature and Purpose of the Proceeding <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The United States of America, acting under the direction of its Attorney General, filed this civil antitrust suit on August 4, 1994, alleging that defendants violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. &sect;1, by entering into an agreement and understanding that unreasonably restrained interstate trade in the manufacture and sale of household insecticides. The agreement featured an exclusive license arrangement and the transfer by Bayer to Johnson of the assets assembled by a Bayer subsidiary, Miles,Inc., to compete in the sale of household insecticides in the United States with a new product, called Laser. Laser's chief active ingredient was Cyfluthrin, which Bayer developed and patented. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that defendants engaged in the following activities: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Bayer licensed Johnson to use Clyfluthrin in household insecticides in the United States, and granted Johnson a right of first refusal for exclusive rights for the United States on future active ingredients developed by Bayer for household insecticides; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Bayer refrained from licensing Johnson's competitors to use or sell Cyflutrhin; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Bayer ended its plans to market Laser and compete with Johnson in the United States household insecticides market. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> The Complaint alleges that the appropriate product market in which to access the competitive effect of the Cyfluthrin license and transfer of assets is the market for the manufacture and sale of household insecticides. This is the appropriate market because other types of insect killers, such as agricultural pesticides, are not good substitutes for household insecticides used to kill ants, roaches, and other insects that typically infest dwellings. The Complaint alleges that the entire United States is the relevant geographic market. In this market, the Complaint alleges, Johnson is the largest firm, and the licensing arrangement helped it to maintain its commanding position. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Marrakech, Apr. 15 (MAP) -- The U.S. Vice President  Al Gore held a meeting here Thursday [April 14] afternoon with  heads of Arab delegations to the GATT ministerial conference  currently held in Marrakech. Al Gore discussed with his  interlocutors the issue of the Arab boycott of Israel saying the  lifting of the boycott will give a new momentum to the Middle  East process in general and to economic cooperation in the  region in particular, reliable sources said.    The US official told MAP at the end of the meeting that  talks  mainly focused on the Middle East peace process. `This meeting  was very positive and I appreciated this opportunity', the US  Vice President said.    Tunisian Foreign Minister Habib Ben Yahya who took part in  the meeting on his part told MAP that the US official explained  to the heads of Arab delegations the stand of the United States  regarding the peace process. As to the Arab boycott of Israel,  Ben Yahya said a decision on the matter falls within the Arab  League competence and does not arise at the level of Arab states  taken separately. It is a collective decision made in the Arab  League context, the Tunisian official said adding that this  issue is not only economic but has also a political dimension.  The Arab world, he went on, is open to dialog and contributes  to the peace process, Ben Yahya said expressing hope to see the  peace process reach positive results and usher in a new regional  order.    Eleven Arab countries are participating in the Marrakech  conference namely Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait,  Qatar, Mauritania, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and the United  Arab Emirates.</p>

			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Lloyd's confirms block on payments LLOYD'S OF London confirmed yesterday that it would act to block payments from the Pounds 116m Outhwaite settlement to Names with outstanding liabilities from their underwriting accounts. Two legal advisers to Lloyd's suggested that the recoveries on behalf of Names - the individuals whose assets underwrite the insurance business - could be dealt with in accordance with its premium trust deed. The deed will allow members' agents to retain any money from the settlement to each Name up to the amount of any liabilities they have from membership of underwriting syndicates. The decision comes after talks started last Friday with representatives of the 987 Names, who were members of the Outhwaite 316/661 syndicate in 1982, and were due to benefit from the out-of-court settlement announced in February. Mr Peter Nutting, the businessman who negotiated the settlement, said he was 'absolutely furious' with the Lloyd's decision. He said preparations had been made for payment of the money to Names this week, and some were away on holiday without any knowledge that Lloyd's might try to prevent payments being made. The Names are seeking to avoid payment of claims this year and believe evidence presented to the commercial court last week alleging irregularities in the management of Gooda Walker syndicates has strengthened their case. Mr David Coleridge, chairman of Lloyd's, said he considered the decision was 'entirely fair' to other Names who had met their own obligations and had to contribute to central funds to meet others' liabilities. It was unclear last night how many Names or how much of the settlement would be affected by the decision.</p>

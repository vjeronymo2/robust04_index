			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Casas pledges to defend foreign exchange system: New chief at helm of Venezuelan Central Bank Mr Antonio Casas Gonzalez, an economist with experience in domestic and international finance, took over as president of Venezuela's central bank at the weekend following three days of pressure on the nation's foreign currency reserves and a sharp decline in the bolivar. In Mr Casas' first public statement as head of the central bank he underscored his commitment to defending the institution's autonomy and pledged to maintain the system of supply and demand of foreign exchange in effect before last week's crisis, when his predecessor resigned. The Venezuelan central bank controls more than 90 per cent of the nation's foreign exchange reserves and its presence on the exchange market, until recently managed under a crawling peg system, is an important factor in determining the value of the bolivar. Problems began last week when Mrs Ruth de Krivoy resigned from the bank presidency; her departure precipitated a rush to buy US dollars. Mrs Krivoy resigned after two years in the post because she felt the government of President Rafael Caldera was trying to compromise the bank's independence. The government quickly appointed Mr Casas as governor but at the same time the central bank was trying to slow sales of dollars to commercial banks, some bankers reported. The initiative, which was started last Wednesday but which was not encouraged by the Caldera government, succeeded only in raising fears of exchange controls. On Friday the central bank set an informal limit on sales to commercial banks and the bolivar suffered its worst decline against the US dollar in the last 16 months, falling by 4.6 per cent to close at 124 to the dollar. At midday yesterday the bolivar continued to fall and demand for dollars was so strong that some banks ran out of US notes. At one commercial bank in Caracas, Banco Venezolano de Credito, the dollar opened yesterday morning at 126 bolivars to the dollar and closed just before noon at 132. This amounted to a devaluation of 4.5 per cent in only a half day's trading.</p>

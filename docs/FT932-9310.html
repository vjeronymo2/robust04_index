			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Abta payouts challenged: Travel companies seek injunction to stop cut in customer refunds SIX TRAVEL companies have applied for an injunction requiring the Association of British Travel Agents to withdraw a threat to limit repayments to customers of failed school-trip operators. The application follows a letter Abta sent to education authorities last month saying the association had decided to limit the losses it suffered when school-tour operators, particularly those offering ski holidays, failed. A High Court hearing on the application began last Tuesday and finished yesterday. The six companies  - Travelbound, Equity, Campus Centres, Ski Partners, Seasun Holidays and STS Travel  - are awaiting judgment. Since setting up its system of consumer protection in the mid-1970s, Abta has said it will ensure that customers are repatriated and their deposits repaid when member companies fail. Abta members have bonds to protect customers, but when these prove inadequate the association's insurance makes up the shortfall. But in 1991 the association came close to financial collapse when it had to make repayments to parents who had paid for ski trips organised by companies which folded. In its letter, the association said it had paid out almost Pounds 12m to parents over the past three years. It said that deposits paid after April 23 this year would not be protected if paid more than 12 months in advance. If paid less than a year in advance they would only be protected up to Pounds 25 a head. The balance of payment would be protected only if it was paid less than 10 weeks before departure. The association subsequently wrote to education authorities and schools pointing out that the limits only applied where failed companies' bonds were inadequate. The restrictions applied to coach and ferry trips only. Charter flight holidays would still be protected fully by Air Travel Organisers' Licences, administered by the Civil Aviation Authority. Mr Andrew Lay, Travelbound's commercial director, said the letters had caused confusion. He said: 'At present, everyone believes if they book a holiday with Abta their money is secure.'</p>

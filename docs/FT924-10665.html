			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / International Company News: Paramount Pictures chairman resigns MR BRANDON TARTIKOFF, a former senior executive at the NBC television network who left NBC 16 months ago to become chairman of Paramount Pictures in Hollywood, resigned from Paramount yesterday citing family obligations. The 43-year-old Mr Tartikoff said he was leaving Paramount to spend more time with his daughter, who was seriously injured in a car accident last year and is undergoing therapy in New Orleans. Mr Martin Davis, chairman of Paramount Communications, the parent company that also owns publishers Simon and Schuster, accepted the resignation after saying he understood this 'had to be an extremely difficult decision for Brandon to make'. Mr Davis said he was naming Mr Stanley Jaffe, Paramount's chief operating officer, as acting chairman of Paramount Pictures on an interim basis. Although there have been rumours in Hollywood of friction between Mr Tartikoff and Messrs Davis and Jaffe, Paramount yesterday heaped praise on the departing studio head. The financial performance of the studio, which Mr Tartikoff had worked to improve, has been considered lacklustre in recent years. Paramount's entertainment division has improved its earnings in recent quarters, thanks to the box office success of films that Mr Tartikoff oversaw such as The Addams Family and Star Trek VI. For his part, Mr Tartikoff told senior executives at Paramount that he needed to be out of Los Angeles for protracted periods to assist his wife in New Orleans 'in this critical stage of my daughter's ongoing rehabilitation from her head injury'. Meanwhile, Paramount's parent company has been rumoured to be interested in making a bid to acquire NBC Television, which is owned by General Electric. Earlier this week it emerged that Mr Bill Cosby, the popular television comedian who is friendly with Paramount's chairman, is keen to acquire NBC.</p>

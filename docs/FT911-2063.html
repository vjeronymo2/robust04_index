			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Tanker held in Yemen dispute: Insurers dismiss port authorities' pollution claims YEMENI authorities have detained a tanker managed by an independent California-based company for alleged pollution caused after an accident in its waters. The Mendana Spirit, managed by Western Marine, part of the Teekay Shipping group, has been detained for 12 weeks in the port of Aden. Teekay's insurers, the London-based Britannia P&amp;I Club, said the vessel's release was dependent on the payment of several million dollars. Demands have ranged from an initial Dollars 59m-Dollars 60m (Pounds 34.7m-Pounds 35.2m) to Dollars 7.5m. The 39,976 gross ton tanker is the third vessel to be held during the past nine months on the same grounds by Yemen's recently formed Public Corporation for Maritime Affairs. Britannia said yesterday that in each case no actual pollution damage had been proved. 'It appears the authorities in Aden are using mere allegations of pollution damage as justification for the detention of ships in order to extract heavy cash payments.' Teekay operates a fleet of 60 tankers and is one of the world's largest independent tanker operators. The Mendana Spirit collided with a Turkish bulk carrier on February 10 but lost none of its fuel or cargo, which was duly unloaded. The Turkish carrier subsequently sank and some of its fuel escaped from the wreck. Port authorities refused permission for the vessel to leave Aden on 14 February and asked Britannia and the carrier's insurer, Steamship Mutual, to help remove the wreck. Britannia said international salvors had submitted bids of between Dollars 3m-Dollars 4m for the wreck removal contract and that the 'balance of the money demanded must therefore relate to the allegation of pollution damage, for which there is no evidence whatsoever'.</p>

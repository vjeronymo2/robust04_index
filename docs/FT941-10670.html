			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / International Company News: Telecom posts record NZDollars 134.6m Telecom, the New Zealand utility controlled by Bell Atlantic and Ameritech, reported record third-quarter earnings of NZDollars 134.6m (USDollars 77m), an 8.9 per cent lift on the NZDollars 123.6m achieved in the same period last year. The improvement pushed Telecom's net earnings for the nine months to December 31 up to NZDollars 386m, a 15.3 per cent increase on the NZDollars 224.7m earned in the same period of last year. Mr Jeff White, chief financial officer, said the company was well on the way to achieving another record profit for the full year. Mr Roderick Deane, chief executive, told a news conference: 'It was a very satisfactory quarter, reflecting growth in the business, systems advances and market retention.' Per-share earnings for the third quarter rose to NZDollars 5.7 cents from 5.2 cents, and earnings per share for the nine months rose to 16.3 cents from 14.2 cents. Third-quarter operating revenue rose by 1.6 per cent to NZDollars 634.6m. Telecom executives said this reflected strong growth in core markets as well as a continued rise in revenues from cellular services, directories and new network services. Volumes in the national call market climbed 10.1 per cent while growth in international calls was up 15.7 per cent.</p>

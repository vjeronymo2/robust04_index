			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Project Columbus sets about trimming the crew: John Gapper reports on moves at Royal Bank of Scotland to reshape its branch network by investing in technology PROJECT Columbus is the name given by Royal Bank of Scotland to its five-year plan to reshape its branch network by investing in technology and cutting 3,500 jobs. 'It seems to symbolise a move forward to a brave new world,' Mr Tony Schofield, the man in charge of the project, said yesterday. The metaphor of a voyage is appropriate to Royal Bank's approach, which is more gradual than that of other banks. But it also symbolises the risk of encountering similar problems to the Italian explorer, who limped back from his last trip 'with the ships rotten, worm-eaten, all in holes'. Such pitfalls have become common for banks that have tried to cut costs and boost income by automating mundane tasks and training staff to sell more products. Spending on technology has often not been accompanied by cuts in staff numbers, so that cost-income ratios have continued to climb. One reason is the traditional culture of banks, which have given staff greater employment security than other sectors of private industry. Many now believe that deteriorating profits have left them with little choice but to press forward with aggressive cutting costs in branch networks. Barclays plans to cut at least 8,000 from its present 77,000 branch staff by 1995, and has closed 120 branches this year. National Westminster is reviewing networks in each of its 21 regions after the first review in the London West End region led to plans to cut 35 of the 90 branches. Royal Bank comes late to this process, compared with a bank such as Midland, which centralised all its branch back office processing in eight centres and closed 250 branches between 1988 and 1991. Yet Midland still has a cost-income ratio of 70.1 per cent, higher that the RBS figure. Mr Schofield, managing director of branch banking at RBS, estimates that if Project Columbus were implemented in full today, the network's cost-income ratio would fall from the present 68 per cent to 53 per cent. That would bring it respectably into line with many building societies. Project Columbus is less ambitious in terms of technology than the efforts of other banks but firmer in cutting staff. The 3,500 cut represents 27 per cent of the 13,000 people working in branches. Mr Schofield says: 'We are trying to match technology to business need, not have the best technology around, which some have tried at enormous cost.' He cites the decision to move back-office work to one branch in a small group rather than adopt Midland's more centralised approach. The reform will be carried out in three stages. The first - between now and the start of 1994 - will include two changes. One is the consolidation of back-office work, the second the introduction of an credit-scoring system like that already used in the bank's Direct Line insurance subsidiary. In the second overlapping stage, between 1993 and the end of 1995, the bank will try to reform the structure of its 780 branches to respond to what it calls retail 'micromarkets'. That will mean having more specialist branches giving specialist advice on products such as mortgages. Mr Schofield cites the example of an experimental RBS outlet in the Meadowhall shopping centre on the outskirts of Sheffield, South Yorkshire. That has no traditional counter service, but opens in the same hours as the centre and has a range of advisers selling financial products. The bank also wants to develop a telephone banking service similar to National Westminster's Actionline service. The third wave will - like Columbus's third voyage to the West Indies - depend on the outcome of the first two. Mr Schofield says the rapid development of technology means it makes more sense to have 'a gestation period' to see what is the best way forward after it has gained experience. There are many uncertainties over Project Columbus, but probably the most pressing is whether the bank will win the necessary co-operation from staff. Mr Sandy Boyle, the Bifu financial services union's deputy general secretary in Scotland, says that is already in jeopardy. Mr Schofield says the use of technology will enrich the average job by reducing paper-shuffling. He says there has been considerable enthusiasm among younger staff for the change. A larger question is whether the longer-serving staff will respond well to the new service culture. 'I can't see how you produce a highly motivated sales team by making every employee look over their shoulder for the next five years,' says Mr Boyle. Like Columbus, the bank's reform may be remembered as much for its destruction of a traditional culture as for its discovery of a new world.</p>

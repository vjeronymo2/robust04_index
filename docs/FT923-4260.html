			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Letter: Inflated record Sir, You class Mr Kevin Maxwell as Britain's biggest bankrupt. Aside from the rather specialised nature of Mr Maxwell's circumstances, no journalist appears to have applied the retail prices index to the former record holder's debt. I calculate Mr Stern's 1974 debt of Pounds 118m to be equivalent to Pounds 632m in 1992. Should we not reinstate Mr Stern with this, er, honour? E Guy Abel, 56 Telford Avenue, London SW2 4XF</p>

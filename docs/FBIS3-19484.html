According to initial reports, which were denied today,  details of the plan had been learned from Luigi Sparacio, a Cosa  Nostra supersnitch who has been collaborating with authorities  for several months. The first stage of the plan to do away with  the two anticorruption prosecutors had already gone into  operation, said well-informed sources, with a mysterious person  paying 500 million lire (300,000 dollars) to an unnamed  recipient to lay the groundwork for an attack. Little  information has emerged about investigations into the case,  since three sticks of explosives were found near the elevator  that goes to Giorgianni's office in the Messina palace of  justice. The explosives had no fuse or detonator. Security has  been stepped up around the Messina prosecutor's office.</p>

			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CUT YOUR UTILITY BILLS: HOME IMPROVEMENT;  </P> <P> SOLAR HEATER PROVIDES DRINKING WATER TOO  </P> <P> QUESTION: We have a large family and spend over $300 per year to heat hot  water. I would like to use a solar system to save money and help save the  environment. Are there still solar systems available?  </P> <P> ANSWER: When the energy tax credits were eliminated, many of the high-priced  solar contractors went out of business. Although solar equipment that you can  use to build your own system is a little harder to find now, it is still  available. There are even some new, very efficient designs.  </P> <P> A typical solar system can provide 60% to 75% of your family's hot water needs  throughout the year. The annual savings can total a couple of hundred dollars.  Since this is after-tax money, it can be equivalent to $300 to $400 of  additional income from your job.  </P> <P> The two most common types of solar systems for heating water utilize flat plate  collectors or concentrating collectors. Concentrating collectors use one of  several methods to focus the sun's rays on to the water to produce higher water  temperatures or steam.  </P> <P> One new and very efficient solar system uses a small concentrating collector to  produce steam and pure distilled drinking water as a byproduct. The collector  is rotated by a small motor throughout the day so it continually faces the sun  most directly. Being relatively small, it is not very noticeable on your house.  </P> <P> The steam from the collector circulates through a pipe in your existing water  heater where it condenses to transfer the heat to the water. On a typical sunny  day, it produces about 3,000 BTU/hour.  </P> <P> Tubing runs from the tank to a water storage jug to collect the purified  distilled drinking water. It produces more than 700 gallons of distilled water  per year. This can save several hundred dollars in bottled water costs or  additional energy consumption to operate an electric distiller.  </P> <P> In recent years, photovoltaics (solar cells that produce free electricity) have  become much more energy-efficient and cost effective. You can tie these into  solar systems to power the small electric motors and controls. It is a natural  fit since the electricity output is greatest when the hot water production is  greatest.  </P> <P> Before you select a solar system for your home, contact a solar designer to  plan a system for your needs. You can always add more collectors to a system as  your budget allows.  </P> <P> You can write to me for Utility Bills Update No. 359 describing the new solar  water heating system that makes distilled drinking water, a list of solar  collector manufacturers and several piping layouts of solar systems. Please  include $1 and a self-addressed business-sized envelope.

Do I need a special type of paint that won't  adversely effect the heat transfer efficiency of them?  </P> <P> A: Most rust-inhibiting paints are fine, as long the cover doesn't get hotter  than 190 degrees. Although the cover normally shouldn't get that hot, check  with the supplier of the baseboard heaters for the temperature specifications.  Painting the cover won't affect the efficiency.  </P> <P> If the temperature gets above 190 degrees, use heat-resistant paints made for  barbecues. Don't paint the actual heating fins under the cover. They get too  hot and the paint can effect the heat transfer properties.  </P> <P> Letters and questions to Dulley, a Cincinnati-based engineering consultant, may  be sent to James Dulley, Los Angeles Times, 6906 Royalgreen Drive, Cincinnati,  Ohio 45244.  </P> <P> </P></p>

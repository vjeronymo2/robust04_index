			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Red tape ties Ossie entrepreneurs: Bureaucracy east Germans thought was a thing of the past Mrs Heidlinde Fatteichar is an energetic east German who expected a lot from unification. She gathered her savings, exchanged her Ost Marks for D-Marks, and confronted the market economy. She leased a small shop in the hamlet of Prebberede in the eastern German state of Mecklenberg-western Pomerania. The size of a large room, it is located in the wing of a dilapidated Schloss, or castle, which once belonged to the old Bassewitz family from Prussia. There are no brash advertising slogans and banners hanging from the ceilings; no piped, anodyne music. It is a simple grocery store offering a limited, but adequate, range of goods for her customers. But no sooner had the unification treaty been signed than she and her friends began to realise that some aspects of life had not changed all that much. The 'Ossies' (the west's scoffing term for easterners) discovered they were being swamped with just another set of rules, regulations and laws to replace those they thought they had left behind. Mrs Fatteichar points to legislation regulating shopping hours. Shops in Germany must close by 6.30pm on weekdays and 2pm on Saturdays. There are some exceptions; shops can remain open until 8.30pm on a Thursday - depending on location - and 4pm on a Saturday, depending on how close they are to the centre/railway/airport. 'I make my own law,' says Mrs Fatteichar, who is in her mid-30s. 'Don't talk to me about those west German regulations. If we took them seriously, we would not be allowed to do anything. I will stay open as long the people want it.' She has an acute business sense. She wants to increase her turnover so that when she moves out - by the end of next month because westerners have bought the Schloss - she can go to the bank, prove she is creditworthy and lease new premises. She is not very hopeful. Not only is Mrs Fatteichar up against antiquated shopping hours, but the local Raiffeisen bank in Teterow is reluctant to grant her a loan of DM120,000 (Pounds 46,000) to lease space. 'I can't win with these western German bankers,' she says. 'They want us to create capital but they will not advance us a loan.' Her bankers have insisted on security. Mrs Fatteichar has more than obliged. She offered them her home. But the bank wanted more security. She offered her 10ha of land as additional mortgage. 'It's still not enough. More and more red tape and obstacles stand in my way,' she says, adding that she had never before asked for credit. 'I have no debts.' Restrictive shopping hours and tight credit restrictions for easterners are two examples of what many see as an inflexible and rigid economic system being imposed on east Germans desperate to unleash years of pent-up energy and channel it into the private sector. It is a view shared by some senior industrialists. Mr Kurt Lauk, a board member of Veba, Germany's energy-based conglomerate, wrote in a recent issue of Daedalus, the journal of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences: 'It is obvious that a competitive renewal in the Federal Republic presupposes a willingness to . . . contain the flood of state intervention, to recognise how regulation and licensing can hinder productivity.' He continued: 'Unfortunately (such regulations) have been carried over to the new states and greatly complicate the problems for their economic reconstruction . . . .' There are some cautious signs that Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the economics minister and member of the liberal Free Democrats, the junior partner in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing coalition, is prepared to start cutting through the myriad of regulations. Last week the minister scored a small victory. The cabinet, pending approval by the Bundestag, voted to get rid of the Rabattgesetz - a law, drawn up in 1933, which prevented shops and retailing outlets from lowering their prices by more than 3 per cent. During the winter and summer sales, retailers will now be allowed a taste of real competition. Already the federal association of medium-sized and large retailers is critical about any reforms. 'Why should we change it?' says Mr Gert Nacken, one of its legal experts. 'We have enough strong competition. With the present kind of price system, customers know where they stand. There is stability.' Many east and west Germans regard the link between price 'stability' and regulation as tantamount to giving the producer precedence over the consumer. There are even some who want to reduce red tape, such as Mr Herbert Helmrich, justice minister of Mecklenberg-western Pomerania. Twelve years ago he founded the Society for the Promotion of de-Bureaucratisation. One of its aims is to speed up decision-making processes by granting civil servants some powers of initiative without the constant and lengthy reference to rules and legislation. The federal Justice Ministry has set up a commission to examine the issue. Meanwhile, Mrs Fatteichar will continue battling with the bankers and will ignore red tape to get on with life in a united Germany. 'Sometimes I don't understand capitalism. Is it meant to be about competition or not?' she asked.</p>

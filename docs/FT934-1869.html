			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / International Company News: More funds for Magyar Suzuki Suzuki Motor of Japan and its partners in the Magyar Suzuki joint venture in Hungary yesterday agreed to increase equity to Ft11.7bn (Dollars 117m) after heavy losses at the car assembly operation. The infusion more than doubles Magyar Suzuki's original equity of Ft5.5bn, with which the venture was established in 1991 as the largest Japanese investment in eastern Europe. Total project costs exceed Y32bn (Dollars 293m). Suzuki, the parent company, will control 49.9 per cent of the capital compared with 40 per cent when the group was formed. This follows a vote of shareholders yesterday. Suzuki's partner Itochu, the Japanese trading house, takes 15.5 per cent compared with 11 per cent in 1991. Suzuki attributed the losses, which it has not quantified, to the depreciation of the Hungarian currency against the yen. Exchange rate movements made the import of parts from Japan more expensive, and increased the burden of Magyar Suzuki's yen borrowings, which the company can now repay. In addition, recession and the importation of second-hand cars have depressed the Hungarian new car market. Local industry analysts also say many Hungarian customers regard the Swift hatchback model produced at Suzuki's factory in Esztergom as too small. Sales have recently begun to increase, with Suzuki forecasting 7,600 local sales and a 25 per cent market share for 1993. The company is nevertheless trying to gain easier access to the EU market so it can offload output originally planned to reach 50,000 by the third year of production. To meet EU requirements, Magyar Suzuki plans to increase domestic content to 50 per cent and EU content to 10 per cent.</p>

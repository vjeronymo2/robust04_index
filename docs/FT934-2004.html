			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Court puts curbs on Nissan UK Strict controls have been placed on the future conduct of business by Nissan UK, the troubled former importer/distributor of Nissan cars, under the terms of a High Court order agreed yester-day. The Inland Revenue, which is seeking repayment of up to Pounds 238m from Nissan UK, issued a petition last month for the winding up of the company. This was followed by the appointment of provisional liquidators. Under yesterday's order, the appointment of the liquidators has been withdrawn. But the company, which was at the centre of Britain's biggest tax fraud, has agreed to onerous conditions. The winding-up petition was sought by the Revenue to prevent the company, which is headed by Mr Octav Botnar and is now largely involved in property, from disposing of its remaining assets prior to the resolution of the Revenue's tax claim. The Revenue petition will now be postponed until: The appeal by Mr Michael Hunt, a former Nissan UK director, has been heard against his conviction and eight-year prison sentence for his part in a conspiracy to defraud the Revenue of Pounds 55m in corporation tax. The company's appeal against the Revenue's tax claims has been resolved. Mr Hunt's appeal is expected to be heard early next year, and the company's tax appeal may be heard late in the year. It is understood that the company made payments in gold bars worth several million pounds earlier this year to Mr Botnar and to Mr Hunt. Under the terms of yesterday's order all Nissan UK 'books, records and documents' are to be removed and lodged with Jeffrey Green Russell, the company's London solicitors. The company's entire issued share capital is to be transferred from Nissan UK Holdings, whose ultimate parent company is the Panama-incorporated European Motor Vehicles Corporation, to the four directors of Nissan UK. They will hold the shares as nominees. The four directors, Mr Frank Haddock, who is the company's local solicitor in Worthing where it is based, Mr Brian Groves, Mr Botnar and Mr Manfred Weder, have given court undertakings. These include to inform the court and the Revenue about any attempt to change the make-up of the company's board, or to remove any assets or alter the company's bank mandate. The directors cannot resign without the court's permission. The company has also agreed not to issue any new shares. Nissan UK last night accused the Revenue of trying to 'destroy' the company. It said the Revenue's objective in trying to wind up the company 'was nothing less than an attempt to deprive Nissan UK of its right to defend itself and its ability to pursue its legitimate claims.'</p>

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Deutsche Bank dips on dimmer outlook Mr Hilmar Kopper, Deutsche Bank chairman, yesterday downgraded his assessment of business prospects, presented unexpectedly poor interim results, and prompted Frankfurt stock exchange traders to mark down the banking group's shares. Announcing a 19 per cent fall to DM3.57bn (Pounds 1.45bn) in operating profits for the first 10 months - earnings at this level were up 1 per cent after six months - he predicted only a 'satisfactory' outcome for the full 12 months. That contrasted with his assessment of an 'above average' performance at halfway after an 'exceptional' year in 1993, and led analysts, due to meet board members tomorrow, provisionally to reduce their earnings per share forecasts for 1994. Deutsche shares closed down DM2.50 at DM735.80 in Frankfurt yesterday, while Dresdner Bank stock, affected on Tuesday by worse-than-expected losses on own-account trading, recovered DM2.30. According to Mr Kopper, Deutsche's earnings from its own account dealings - down 67 per cent at DM543m, the same proportion as at halfway - were generated mainly by equities trading. The own-account securities business, on the other hand, was affected by DM327m in write-offs on bonds in the 10 months under review. Deutsche wrote down some DM147m on its bonds business in the first half. Net commission income was virtually unchanged on the comparable part of 1993 at DM4.87bn after being up 6 per cent in the first six months. Interest earnings, unchanged at halfway, fell 2.7 per cent to DM9.5bn. Heavy risk provisions, after rising during the recession, were still needed to cover potentially bad loans especially in the domestic market, Mr Kopper said. About DM1.5bn of provisions were written back compared with DM1.3bn in the comparable part of 1993, reducing net provisions to DM1.6bn. Group loans outstanding at the end of October totalled DM327bn, 1.8 per cent less than at the end of the last financial year. There was a fall of DM11bn in short and medium-term loans to customers, while long-term lending increased by almost DM7bn. Lex, Page 26</p>

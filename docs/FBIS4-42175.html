			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Labour's Choice, the More Open the Contest, </F> the Better"]    [Text] By deciding to hold its leadership elections in  July, the Labour Party has ensured that John Major will not be  unseated in a fit of panic after the European elections.  Instead, for six weeks, Labour will be the focus of media  attention. In most of the past 15 years, such close scrutiny of  the Opposition would most probably have ended in political  disaster. Whether this leadership campaign can be conducted in  a spirit of constructive argument will be a sign of whether  Labour has indeed matured into a party fit to be considered for  government.    To hasten the procedure was wise. Already Labour is likely  to suffer in the European elections from not having filled the  gap left by John Smith's death. To have left the leadership  unresolved through the summer would have been to invite a long  campaign from which the contestants would have emerged stale,  exhausted and possibly embittered. Margaret Beckett has not  only saved the party money by conceding a contest for deputy  leader on the same day; she has also prevented the risk of the  second placed candidate in July deciding to challenge her for  deputy leader in the autumn.    Some in the party are still keen that a Blair and Beckett  "dream ticket" should be adopted by acclaim without a contest.  Others are hoping that Gordon Brown will refrain from standing  so as not to muddy the modernising message of Tony Blair. Both  are misguided. The Labour Party would do far better to hold an  open contest with as many contenders as want to compete.    The transferable voting system that the NEC [National  Executive Committee] has chosen means that there is little  danger of Mr Blair and Mr Brown splitting the modernisers vote  and letting John Prescott in. If the two men are united on  policy, then it is right that they should each set out their  personal visions of the future of the Labour Party so that their  electorate can decide which articulates them better.    As long as the contestants avoid attacking each other, this  debate will be good for Labour. For six weeks, senior shadow  Cabinet members will have a free run in the media, unopposed by  their Conservative counterparts. The more contestants there  are, the more talents will be on show to the voters.    This is a chance too to define a new Labour Party. However  successful Mr Smith was at uniting the party and attacking the  Tories, his was still a holding operation. He had not spelled  out his philosophy; and the lacuna was allowed to continue while  feuding Conservatives captured the news. The only pledge he  made in his leadership campaign was to introduce  one-member-one-vote into party elections. The contenders in  this much more closely fought campaign will not have the luxury  of silence.    Yet their arguments need not be divisive. Neil Kinnock and  Mr Smith encouraged Labour to shed its old nostrums. There is  now a thirst for the new. Mr Blair, in particular, seems ready  to quench it with his talk of a new compact between the  individual and the community. After more than a decade of  successfully promoting the individual over the collective,  voters are starting to think further ahead. Many fer moral  breakdown and yearn for a politics that talks of duties as well  as rights, responsibilities as well as entitlements. Senior  Conservatives, led by Michael Portillo and Michael Howard, have  entered this ground. But so can Labour. Mr Blair called on  Tuesday for "a modern notion of citizenship," where rights and  duties go hand in hand. Under the spotlight of a leadership  contest, he and his colleagues can spell out more precisely what  these notions mean to them.</p>

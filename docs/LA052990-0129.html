			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> NORWAY SUCCESSION CHANGED  </P> <P> Norway today scrapped rules giving royal sons first rights to the throne,  abolishing one of the last bastions of male dominance in a country that prides  itself on equal rights for women.  </P> <P> Only seven members of the 165-member Parliament voted against the amendment,  the Norwegian news agency NTB reported.  </P> <P> But the current Princess Martha Louise, 18, will not precede her younger  brother Prince Haakon Magnus, 16, in the line of succession because the rule  applies only to royal heirs born after 1990.  </P> <P> Both the prince and princess are children of Crown Prince Harald, the son of  King Olav, who at 86 is Europe's oldest reigning monarch.  </P> <P> Also today, the Socialist Left Party revived a parliamentary proposal to  abolish the monarchy upon King Olav's death. But only 19 votes were cast in  favor of making Norway a republic.  </P></p>

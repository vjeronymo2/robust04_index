			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Arts: Good Friday Television Television has never been awfully good at Easter. Not so many years ago we used to have circuses, but those have gone and nothing much has taken their place ..unless you count A Song For Europe which certainly has some circus-like qualities (8.30 BBC1). This is not the Eurovision Song Contest, of course, but the programme in which Britain's entry for that competition is chosen. Earlier in the day (a video recorder would seem to be in order) Channel 4 brings what some of us regard as the greatest piece of music of any sort ever written: Bach's St Matthew Passion (9.30am). First heard on Good Friday 264 years ago, it is performed today by the Neubeuern Choral Society and the Bach Collegium in the Romanesque church of Alpirsbach. It lasts 3 1/4 hours. Bookmark screens the first of a two-part biography of Philip Larkin (9.40 BBC2).</p>

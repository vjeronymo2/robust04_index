			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Allegations over former NUM man MR TAM DALYELL, Labour MP for Linlithgow, has linked Mr Roger Windsor, a former National Union of Mineworkers official who was a leading figure in the 1984-85 pit strike, with Mrs Stella Rimington, the recently appointed head of MI5, the security service. He used business questions in the Commons to claim that he had heard statements linking Mrs Rimington with Mr Windsor since tabling a motion inquiring into the MI5 official's activities during the strike. The motion called on the government to make a full statement on connections between Mrs Rimington and Mr David Hart, an adviser to Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the former prime minister, and Sir Ian MacGregor, the former Coal Board chairman who was closely involved with opponents of the strike.</p>

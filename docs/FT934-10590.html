			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / International Company News: Repap reduces losses with firmer pricing REPAP Enterprises, one of North America's top coated paper producers, reduced third quarter losses, thanks to firmer pricing and increased efficiency at its Canadian and US mills. The lower Canadian dollar and lower interest rates helped, writes Robert Gibbens. The pre-tax loss was CDollars 32.2m (USDollars 24.6m), down from CDollars 51m a year earlier. Revenues rose 7 per cent to CDollars 309m, with coated papers and construction timber showing good gains, but market pulp remained. The nine-month pre-tax loss was CDollars 103m, against CDollars 171m.</p>

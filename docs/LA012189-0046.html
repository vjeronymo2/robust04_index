			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> APPLE POLISHER?  </P> <P> Three cheers for Ken Adams' blasting of the L.A. Times' love affair with New  York City (Saturday Letters, Jan. 14).  </P> <P> But Mr. Adams is too general in his complaint. The chief culprit is Dan (Brooks  Atkinson Is My Idol) Sullivan, who makes a yearly trek to Broadway to tell us  all about shows that we might be able to see in two years, if a Los Angeles  company is formed, that is.  </P> <P> My favorite of Broadway Dan's New York reviews concerns Mike Nichols' recent  production of "Waiting for Godot." Here was a show that sold out long before it  opened; that was so packed that they had to hold a lottery to determine who  could see it. It was a production that had nothing to do with L.A., but Dan  spent half a page telling us about it. In the meantime, our Equity Waiver  theater is relegated to one column in Stage Beat on Fridays. Jeesh!  </P> <P> JON MULLICH  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P></p>

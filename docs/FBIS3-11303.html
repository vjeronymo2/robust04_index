About ten of them denounce, in a  statement to Radio Metropole, the disastrous effects of the  international sanctions imposed on Haiti. Enough is enough said  the residents of Cite Soleil who are calling on the concerned  authorities to assume their responsibilities. The residents  assert that they are willing to accept any solution to the  crisis as long as it allows the lifting of the embargo and the  end of the nightmare for the Haitian people.    [Begin unidentified speaker recording in Creole] Even if the  Army takes power we do not mind. We want the embargo to be  lifted, the population to find food to eat, gasoline prices to  drop, and the security problems to be solved so that everyone  can normally go about his activities. Whether it is the  parliament or the Army which takes over, as long as we can eat  and drink, we do not mind. We heard on the radio that [Front for  Haitian Advancement and Progress Leader] Mr. Constant asserted  that he would find a solution to the crisis.    We are calling on those people to find a solution. It is  time that they save the country because Aristide is out of the  question. We are not concerned with Aristide since he did not  return on 30 September. It is a scenario being played. It is a  movie, a play but they [not further identified] want to use the  population as a cover. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, 14 Apr, BNS -- Lithuanian President  Algirdas Brazauskas on 8 April named Lieutenant Colonel  Audronius Beisys, Army vehicles engineer, to be aide-de-camp to  the president.    A President's Office official said Brazauskas had no  aide-de-camp until now because "we could not afford one."    The principal function of an aide-de-camp is to assist the  president in fulfilling his duties as the supreme commander in  chief of the Armed Forces.    Until his present appointment, Beisys, 41, served as acting  commander of the Gelezinis Vilkas (Iron Wolf) infantry brigade.  He is a graduate of a Soviet military academy in Leningrad and  until 1988 served in a paratrooper brigade of the Transcaucasian  command.    Beisys began service in the Lithuanian system of defense in  1991. He is divorced and has two children.</p>

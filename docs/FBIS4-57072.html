			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Castello's column, by Marcelo Pontes: "Understanding the </F> Latest Poll Results"]    [Text] At first glance, one of the most striking findings  of the latest IBOPE [Brazilian Public Opinion and Statistics  Institute] election poll--the decline of Luis Inacio Lula da  Silva from 37 percent to 31 percent once Jose Sarney enters the  race--is not, strictly speaking, a surprising revelation.    Since last year, whenever Sarney is included in IBOPE's  scenarios, Lula's rating drops. Today, neither is Lula's 31  percent his most modest performance vis-a-vis Sarney, nor does  the former president's current 13 percent represent his best  score against the PT [Workers Party] candidate. Last September,  Lula had 27 percent to Sarney's 14 percent. The tally was 26 to  12 percent in January of this year, and 30 percent to 11 percent  at the end of March.    It is interesting to observe how Lula and Sarney, whose  ideological traits differ so greatly, have such similar profiles  in the IBOPE surveys. Both do better with low-income voters who  have less schooling and live in the Northeast.    Sarney has hovered in the 11 to 14 percent range since last  year, fluctuating with the drubbings he gets. He has still not  been heavily attacked enough by the opposing candidates for  measures to be taken of the resistance of the armor that keeps  him stuck in the same IBOPE bracket, regardless of the changing  cast of characters of candidates around him. Quercia enters,  Maluf leaves, Amin and Flavio Rocha appear, Fernando Henrique  settles in--and Sarney holds on to his captive electorate.    There are two ways of interpreting Lula's persistent  leadership in the polls. One is the reading given by IBOPE. The  institute's experts think it is strange that Lula does not get  60 percent of voter intentions when he is not in office, is not  living in a glass house, has become the counterpoint to all the  bad that Fernando Collar embodied, and has passed unscathed  through the tough times experienced by politicians in general in  the past three years.    The other, and more accurate, way to look at this is to  consider Lula's first-place position as an electoral miracle. He  has a little more than 30 percent thanks to the virtues that, in  IBOPE's opinion, ought to propel him up to 60 percent. And one  of the reasons he is not reaching that 60 percent is that his  face is not on everyone's TV sets in prime time as is Fernando  Henrique's, for example.    The slippage of two or three percentage points in Fernando  Henrique's rating compared with the previous poll falls within  the survey's sampling error, IBOPE says. What is most important  to the tucano candidate are the trends recorded  within his own universe of likely voters.    Although he has not risen in the general index, Fernando  Henrique has improved his profile in the heartland of the  survey. In that fat slice of voters who have gone no further in  school than 4th grade--50 percent of the electorate--he has  climbed from 8 to 12 percent. In the 25 percent slice of the  electorate that finished 8th grade, Fernando Henrique has risen  from 13 to 19 percent. In the other groups (high school and  college graduates), his standing is stable. In other words,  Fernando Henrique has grown in stature right where he needs to  grow--among the 75 percent of voters who will actually control  the outcome of the election.    This evolution of the tucano candidate is  consistent with the findings in another variant of the survey,  the one that groups voters by family income bracket. Fernando  Henrique has improved his likability rating from 6 to 10 percent  among the multitude of Brazilians who earn no more than one  minimum monthly wage. And among the neighboring population that  earns from one to two minimum wages he has jumped from 10 to 14  percent.    Separating voters by regions, Fernando Henrique turns in his  best performances in the Northeast, home to almost 30 percent of  the electorate (where he went from 6 to 11 percent), and in the  South (he increased from 13 to 17 percent).    Seen as a whole, the poll sends certain messages. One of  them  is that Fernando Henrique still depends on the favorable breeze  from the real, a monetary unit that has a flair for  becoming election currency. Another is that Sarney is  establishing himself in the mind of the voter-in-the-street as a  more viable candidate than Quercia, which does not mean he will  have the same success among voters in the PMDB [Brazilian  Democratic Movement Party] who will choose their candidate in a  primary.    A third message is the remarkable 10-point (from 39 to 49  percent) growth in the index that measures voter rejection of  Leonel Brizola. Pollsters did not ask about motivation for this  change, but suspects it is a repercussion of the numbers-game  scandal in Rio de Janeiro that involves politicians associated  with the former governor.    But none of these indications is more important than the  certainty that a lot of water has yet to flow under the bridge.  The election campaign will not heat up until after the World  Cup, and will not go into high gear until after 2 August, when  free radio and TV air time becomes available.</p>

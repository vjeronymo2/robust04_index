			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FORMER STATE S&amp;L COMMISSIONER LAWRENCE TAGGART;  </P> <P> EX-REGULATOR'S RULING ON LINCOLN QUESTIONED  </P> <P> Lawrence W. Taggart, former commissioner of the California Department of  Savings and Loan, made a ruling favorable to Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in late  1984, a month before he left office to join a firm that then received a  $2.9-million investment from the S&amp;L.  </P> <P> Taggart acknowledged Thursday that he gave Irvine-based Lincoln approval in  December, 1984, to put $800 million into subsidiaries that were allowed to make  direct investments in real estate, securities and other risky ventures.  </P> <P> On Jan. 1, 1985, Taggart left office to join TCS Financial Inc., a San  Diego-based financial services firm. About three weeks later, Lincoln invested  nearly $2.9 million in TCS to pick up a 19.1% stake in the firm's initial  public offering of stock.  </P> <P> The nation's top thrift regulator at the time, Edwin J. Gray, said Thursday  that Taggart was "lining up (future) clients rather than regulating."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Consultant to S&amp;Ls  </P> <P> Taggart has become a target of criticism in recent years for permitting  speculative practices by S&amp;Ls -- even though they were allowed by law --  that some critics say caused the industry's multibillion-dollar debacle and led  to the recently enacted bailout law.  </P> <P> He has also been criticized for agreeing to consult for S&amp;L executives who  were running their institutions into the ground with risky business strategies.  Taggart said he has offered his services to those most in need -- troubled  institutions.  </P> <P> Since leaving his state post, Taggart has tried to devise new business plans  for such insolvent institutions as Vernon Savings &amp; Loan in Texas, which  failed in 1987 when regulators said that 96% of its loans were bad. The failure  cost the government $1.3 billion.  </P> <P> He also headed a subsidiary of Trafalgar Holdings, the company that Charles W.  Knapp founded after being ousted from American Savings &amp; Loan. Knapp's  policies were blamed for leading American Savings into insolvency and costing  the government $1.7 billion.  </P> <P> In regard to Lincoln, Taggart denied that there was any "quid pro quo" in his  actions toward the S&amp;L while he held public office. He said in an interview  that he didn't even know in January, 1985, that Lincoln had bought TCS stock.  </P> <P> Thomas C. Stickel, the founder of TCS Financial (now called TCS Enterprises)  and a prominent state Republican with ties to Gov. George Deukmejian, said it  was "absolutely ridiculous" to suggest that Taggart had anything to do with  Lincoln's investment in TCS. In fact, Stickel went on, the investment came only  after he (Stickel) met with Charles H. Keating Jr., whose Phoenix-based  company, American Continental Corp., owned Lincoln.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Approved Application  </P> <P> Regulators seized Lincoln on April 14, a day after American Continental filed  for bankruptcy protection. Regulators recently declared Lincoln insolvent and  put it in receivership. The S&amp;L is projected to cost taxpayers up to $2.5  billion to sell or close, which would be the nation's costliest thrift failure.  </P> <P> Taggart became the state's S&amp;L commissioner in 1983 as industry  deregulation was attracting numerous real estate developers and other  entrepreneurs into the business. In early 1984, he approved American  Continental's $51-million purchase of Lincoln. It was one of about 150  applications he approved, he said.  </P> <P> From the start, though, Lincoln was aggressive, embarking on rapid growth  through investments. The S&amp;L rapidly turned away from making traditional  home loans in favor of funding large real estate developments. The new  direction was permitted under the industry's deregulation, which allowed  S&amp;Ls to invest federally insured deposits in a variety of risky ventures.  </P> <P> Taggart said Lincoln was often asking approval for one type of investment or  another. Through 1984, he said, he approved about half of Lincoln's requests.  </P> <P> Meantime, Gray, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, was becoming  alarmed about the new investments that some S&amp;Ls were making, and he  proposed a rule that would force all S&amp;Ls to limit direct investments to  10% of their assets.  </P> <P> In late 1984, Lincoln applied to move $800 million into subsidiaries that would  be allowed by the new rule to continue making direct investments. Gray's rule  was adopted in early 1985, and "grandfathered" such transfers of cash made  before Dec. 10, 1984.  </P> <P> On Dec. 7, 1984, Taggart approved the transfer, thus allowing Lincoln to beat  what would become the deadline.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Hit it Off'  </P> <P> A month earlier, Taggart had announced he would step down as commissioner at  the end of the year. He said no one but Stickel knew that he would join TCS.  Stickel, a self-made millionaire, said he had been trying to lure Taggart from  his post for most of that year.  </P> <P> In early January, Taggart said, Keating called him to arrange a consulting  contract, and the former commissioner said he took Stickel with him to Phoenix  to meet Keating. From there, he said, Stickel and Keating "hit it off" and  began working on deals he was unaware of.  </P> <P> TCS, for instance, invested $400,000 in the Hotel Pontchartrain in downtown  Detroit and received a 4% interest in the hotel. A partnership in which Lincoln  was a general partner and Keating one of the limited partners owns the hotel.  </P> <P> Lincoln's $2.9-million investment in TCS was more than half the $4.3 million  the company raised in the stock offering. It bolstered the 18-month-old firm,  which had been losing money from start-up costs, Stickel said.  </P> <P> TCS lost $1 million in its first two years, but had earned $1.3 million in the  next three years. It posted net income of $538,000 for the first six months of  its fiscal year ended April 30.  </P></p>

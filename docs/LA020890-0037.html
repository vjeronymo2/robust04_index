			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> KANSAS LEARNS LESSON, BEATS OKLAHOMA STATE  </P> <P> Roy Williams hopes his second-ranked Kansas Jayhawks learned something, like  how a 24-point lead can sometimes be a mirage.  </P> <P> The Jayhawks' lead dwindled to six points before they put away Oklahoma State,  83-76, Wednesday night in a Big Eight Conference game at Stillwater, Okla.  </P> <P> "I'm a very positive person," Williams said. "I'm not happy about it, I don't  like it, but maybe it's good for us."  </P> <P> Kansas (23-1 overall, 6-1 in the Big Eight) had a 60-36 lead with 10:21 left,  but Oklahoma State (13-8, 4-5) rallied to make it 75-69 with 2:16 remaining  before the Jayhawks escaped.  </P> <P> Mattias Sahlstrom and Byron Houston scored 17 points each for Oklahoma State.  </P> <P> No. 3 Arkansas 100, Texas Tech 77 -- Todd Day scored 22 points as the  Razorbacks rolled past the Red Raiders for their 12th consecutive win in a  Southwest Conference game at Fayetteville, Ark.  </P> <P> Ron Huery and Lee Mayberry each scored 15 points for Arkansas (20-2, 11-0),  which took control with 12 consecutive points for a 30-19 lead.  </P> <P> Will Flemons had 16 points and 13 rebounds for Texas Tech (5-15, 0-10), which  lost a school-record 11th consecutive game.  </P> <P> No. 5 Georgetown 97, Pittsburgh 81 -- Dikembe Mutombo scored 17 points, grabbed  15 rebounds and blocked eight shots and the Hoyas took over the Big East  Conference lead by defeating the Panthers at Landover, Md.  </P> <P> Alonzo Mourning added 20 points and Mark Tillmon had 17 for Georgetown (18-2,  8-2), which led by 18 at halftime and moved a half-game ahead of second-place  Connecticut.  </P> <P> Bobby Martin scored 27 points for the Panthers (9-11, 3-6), who had a  three-game winning streak snapped. Pitt is 0-8 against Georgetown at the  Capital Centre.  </P> <P> No. 11 Louisiana State 82, Auburn 71 -- Chris Jackson scored a career-low nine  points but big men Shaquille O'Neal and Stanley Roberts took over to lead the  Tigers to a Southeastern Conference victory at Baton Rouge, La.  </P> <P> The 7-foot-1 O'Neal had 19 points and 10 rebounds for LSU (18-4, 8-3), while  the 7-foot Roberts had 15 points and 10 rebounds.  </P> <P> Ronnie Battle scored 29 points for Auburn (8-14, 4-7).  </P> <P> No. 13 Oklahoma 86, Iowa State 81 -- Skeeter Henry scored 25 points, including  the go-ahead basket with 2:14 left, and the Sooners got past the Cyclones in a  Big Eight game at Ames, Iowa.  </P> <P> Iowa State (7-12, 2-5) had a chance to tie the game with five seconds left, but  Doug Collins made only one of two free throws and the Sooners sank four free  throws in the closing seconds.  </P> <P> Victory Alexander scored 20 points for Iowa State.  </P> <P> No. 16 Georgia Tech 79, Wake Forest 70 -- Brian Oliver scored 31 points,  including seven three-pointers, and the Yellow Jackets got an Atlantic Coast  Conference victory at Atlanta.  </P> <P> Dennis Scott had 17 points for Georgia Tech (15-4, 5-4) despite a bruised  shoulder, but he didn't hit a three-pointer for the first time in 70 games.  </P> <P> Chris King scored 25 points for Wake Forest (8-12, 0-8), which lost its 10th  consecutive ACC regular-season game.  </P> <P> Kentucky 100, Vanderbilt 73 -- Derrick Miller scored 40 points, becoming the  36th player in Kentucky history to reach the 1,000-point mark, as the Wildcats  snapped a three-game losing streak against the Commodores in an SEC game at  Lexington, Ky.  </P> <P> Miller sparked a 28-10 run with 16 points in the first eight minutes of the  second half to give Kentucky (11-10, 7-5) a 74-46 lead.  </P> <P> Derrick Wilcox scored 16 points for Vanderbilt (12-8, 5-6).  </P> <P> Clemson 75, Maryland 73 -- Elden Campbell scored 18 of his 20 points in the  second half and the Tigers got an ACC victory over the Terrapins at College  Park, Md.  </P> <P> It was only the third victory for Clemson (17-5, 5-3) in 21 years at Maryland's  Cole Field House.  </P> <P> Jesse Martin scored 18 points for Maryland ( 13-9, 4-4).  </P> <P> North Carolina State 88, North Carolina 77 -- Rodney Monroe scored 22 points  and the Wolfpack beat the Tar Heels at Chapel Hill, N.C., for the first time in  14 years.  </P> <P> The Wolfpack (16-6, 5-3) broke the game open with a 13-3 burst that gave them a  73-61 lead.  </P> <P> Rick Fox scored 22 points for North Carolina (18-8, 5-3).  </P></p>

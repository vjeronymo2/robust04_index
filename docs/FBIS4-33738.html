			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Gustavo Patu and Monica Izaguirre] </F>   [Text] Central Bank [BC] figures have cast doubts over the  possibility that the government will be able to balance its  accounts, as is provided for in the Union's budget for 1994 and  in the Real Plan.    According to BC estimates that were made available to FOLHA,  interest payments on the foreign and domestic debts will surpass  the $7.7 billion budget provision.    The BC estimates that such payments will amount to 2.1  percent of the GDP (gross domestic product, or the goods and  services produced by the country). This percentage amounts to  from $9 billion to $10 billion, depending on the GDP figure.    This difference is enough to make government spending  surpass  the income provisions of the 1994 budget. In the budget bill  submitted to Congress, government spending and income are equal.    Balancing government accounts is considered a foundation of  the Real Plan, as it will prevent the government from printing  money or contracting debts to pay its expenses.    The BC estimates were made in February and, according to BC  technicians, they were not updated. The budget provision for  paying the interest on the debt has remained unchanged since  December.    PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] Deputy for Sao  Paulo Barbieri, the rapporteur of the budget bill in the Chamber  of Deputies, also suspects that the budget provision for  repaying the debt is underestimated.    In a preliminary report, Barbieri said it was "very strange"  that the $7.7 billion provision made in December had not been  modified to match the rise in interest since the beginning of  the year.    Since the end of 1993 interest rates have risen from about  17  percent annually above inflation to more than 30 percent. The  domestic debt grew from $48 billion to $53.5 billion.    The IMF mission that looked into the government accounts in  March shared this distrust.    The IMF considered that spending was underestimated and that  part of the budget income was overestimated. The IMF preferred  not to conclude an agreement with Brazil.</p>

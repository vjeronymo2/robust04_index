			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SWARMS OF YELLOW JACKETS PUT CALIFORNIANS TO FLIGHT  </P> <P> Many Californians will remember this summer not for heat waves or pennant races  but for the swarms of meat-eating yellow jackets that have declared a painful  war on bare skin as far north up the Pacific Coast as British Columbia.  </P> <P> "Those suckers are eating us alive," said Ruth Budesa of Sonora, a town in the  Sierra Nevada foothills that has one of the worst infestations in what has  become the worst summer for yellow jackets in memory.  </P> <P> Yellow jackets are a plague to late-summer picnickers every year in much of the  West. But this year the wasps are driving loggers out of the forests, forcing  campers to flee state parks and sending many more people to the hospital, some  in serious condition. At least one horse has died after scaring up a nest of  the wasps, sometimes called meat bees because of their appetite for flesh.  </P> <P> "This in my 10 years of experience is the worst I've ever seen for meat bees,"  said Ed Heneveld, who treats sting victims in the emergency room at Tahoe  Forest Hospital in Truckee. "I've treated five people myself who have been  stung inside the mouth."  </P> <P> More than 20 sting victims sought aid at the Yosemite medical clinic this  weekend, including one person in severe shock, spokeswoman Mallory Smith said  Monday. About 100 visitors have reported stings in the last three weeks, and  park rangers are advising campers to avoid eating outside if they can help it.  </P> <P> Weather is one factor in the yellow jacket invasion. Mild winters allowed more  queen yellow jackets to survive and set up new nests in the spring.  </P> <P> This time of year is also when the worker yellow jackets turn more assertive in  their search for protein to stock the queen's winter nest. The workers go after  sandwiches, fish, soft drinks, hamburgers, even human skin -- anything that  resembles meat or sugar for the nest.  </P> <P> But entomologists also put some of the blame for the yellow jacket invasion on  a new, more aggressive species of wasp from northern Europe. The Germanica  variety swarms in much bigger colonies than the native California wasps.  Instead of 150 to 300 worker wasps capable of stinging, a nest of the German  intruders can have 5,000 to 6,000.  </P> <P> And they are more belligerent, say insect experts, although the yellow jacket  is not one of the more friendly airborne insects even on his best days.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Initiation Disrupted  </P> <P> Last weekend some ornery yellow jackets disrupted the initiation of new  "Clampers" -- members of the fraternal group E Clampus Vitus -- at Kennedy  Meadows in the central Sierra Nevada. In one rite an egg was broken over the  head of an inductee.  </P> <P> "They swarmed all over his head," said Terry Barchus, an observer who escaped  with one sting on his arm. "He had to be washed off real fast. Luckily he  wasn't stung."  </P> <P> Fighting back is not advisable, say those with experience.  </P> <P> "As soon as you slap at a yellow jacket they immediately sting," said Glenn  Bissell, who has fought a losing battle against the wasps for nine years for  the El Dorado County Health Department. "You have to brush them off slowly."  </P> <P> Last year, which was the worst of the 1980s before now, Bissell caught about  five or six wasps a week in each trap he set out in the Lake Tahoe area. Now he  is catching more than 50 a week in each trap, some of them the German variety.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Phenomenal Number'  </P> <P> "We're seeing just a phenomenal number of yellow jackets," Bissell said. "The  beaches are just humming with them right now."  </P> <P> Earlier this month, Janice Carmen was riding horses at Clark's Fork, east of  Sonora in the Emigrant Wilderness, when the two lead horses walked over a nest  and scared up a cloud of wasps. The third horse, a 14-year-old gelding named  Cody, was stung severely on the legs and haunches. Carmen, riding on the fourth  mount, managed to help gather the horses and get them away without being stung  herself.  </P> <P> Cody was surrounded by a second swarm and stung again before the group made it  back to camp. The animal went into shock, Carmen said, and died soon after  despite a veterinarian's care.  </P> <P> "The best thing you can do is find where they go in the ground at night, pour  motor oil into the burrow and light it," Carmen said.  </P> <P> All yellow jackets make pests of themselves in about the same way. They hover  around food and sweet drinks and, when they land, will try to grab pieces of  food with their mandibles. The mandibles can also be used to bite humans, but  it is the stinger that contains the venom. Unlike honey bees, which typically  sting once and leave their stinger, yellow jackets can sting repeatedly.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sting Can Be Deadly  </P> <P> "One sting is enough to kill a hyper-sensitive human," said George Poinar, an  entomologist at UC Berkeley. "Fifty to 75 stings are enough to kill a normal  human."  </P> <P> California officials are unable to recall any fatalities blamed for certain on  yellow jackets. However, Roger Akre, an entomologist at the University of  Washington who wrote the landmark book on yellow jackets, said that more than  500 people a year in the United States may die of sting reactions that are  attributed to heart attacks or other ailments.  </P> <P> Loggers and other forest workers are being hit harder than tourists this year.  Trucks and tractors on the forest floor disturb the nests, then the wasps swarm  and drive the operators and loggers for cover.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Loggers Refusing to Work  </P> <P> In some areas, loggers have been refusing to work, said Dan Ward of the Sonora  office of the California Department of Forestry. "As soon as you get out of the  truck you have them buzzing around your head," he said. "If you come near their  nest they come out with a vengeance."  </P> <P> The good news, say the insect experts, is that the wasps should begin to die  off as soon as the weather turns cool. "This is probably the last big month,"  Poinar said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> NASTY SUMMER VISITOR  </P> <P> Yellow jackets, wasps of the genus Vespula, are most active in late summer.  Found in most of the West, they sometimes build hives in attics or under eaves,  but the most threatening species to humans nest in the ground. This time of  year they are drawn to many kinds of foods -- meat, fish and sweet things such  as soft drinks and candy -- seeking protein to store in the nest for winter.  Yellow jackets sting when provoked and, unlike honey bees, can sting  repeatedly. They also have mandibles used to grab meat and, sometimes, to bite  humans. Sting victims should seek immediate medical help if they feel any  difficulty breathing, a lump in the throat or chest pain.W.T. DAVIDSON /  National Aububon Society  </P></p>

			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: Northwest Airlines maintains advance Northwest Airlines yesterday reinforced the picture of recovery among the big US carriers by reporting its highest-ever quarterly profits for the three months to September. Northwest said net income jumped from Dollars 110.7m to Dollars 170m in the third quarter, its fifth consecutive profitable quarter. The size of the increase echoed the figures reported a day earlier by American Airlines, which increased net profits to Dollars 188m from Dollars 102m. Northwest said revenues rose 6.5 per cent to Dollars 2.5bn and operating profits rose 34 per cent to Dollars 359.2m. Earnings per share, fully diluted, were up 19 per cent at Dollars 1.73. Like American, Northwest has been responding to competition from smaller, low-cost carriers in the US by cutting unprofitable routes and increasing productivity in its remaining operations. It has also benefited from lower fuel prices and economic growth. Last year Northwest won a substantial reduction in its costs by reaching a deal with its workforce in which it swapped a 27.4 per cent stake in the company for wage cuts and other labour concessions worth Dollars 886m over 39 months. The airline has also suffered less badly from low-cost competition than some other big carriers. Many of the areas Northwest serves are less densely populated and are therefore less suitable for the high-frequency, short-haul shuttle services that low-cost operators offer. Southwest Airlines, the biggest of the low-cost US carriers, continued its strong profits growth with a 20 per cent increase in net income to Dollars 58.6m in the third quarter.</p>

			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> JOB ACT CHANGES PROPOSED TO AID YOUTHS  </P> <P> Labor Secretary Elizabeth Hanford Dole proposed changes in the nation's main  jobs program for the poor that she said would direct aid and training to those  most at risk of failure in the employment market. "Those without basic skills  are on a one-way street to a dead-end future," Dole said in announcing a  package of proposed amendments to the Job Training Partnership Act. At the  heart of her proposal is a Youth Opportunities Unlimited program, which would  offer "challenge grants" to communities with large numbers of economically  disadvantaged youths and young adults. "We must break the cycle of cynicism  that has hold of many of our youth," Dole told the House Education and Labor  Committee. "There is an urgent need for more than job training. Many  desperately need basic skills training, literacy and remedial education."  </P></p>

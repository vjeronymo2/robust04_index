			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RED HOT 'CHINA'  </P> <P> I've been a devoted fan of "China Beach" from the very beginning, and if  anything the show is better than ever. I admire the producers for having the  guts to break away from the status quo and explore new methods of storytelling.  You couldn't get better writing, directing and acting than this season's  "Fever" episode in which McMurphy returns home.  </P> <P> Lynn Woods, Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Port-au-Prince, 18 May (AFP) -- Provisional  President Emile Jonassaint (who is not recognized by the  international community) asked Haitians on Wednesday to rally  around the national flag and reconcile themselves "as brothers  of the same nation."    In a radio and television message broadcast to the nation on  18 May on the occasion of Flag Day and of the University of  Haiti [as received], Jonassaint said the "union of the (Haitian)  people is as necessary now as it was during the conquest for  independence." He also urged Haitians, at a time when  "consciences are being manipulated, to receive the legacy of our  ancestors" and "hoist the flag before the people" and "protect  its honor."    Prime Minister Robert Malval, who was forced to resign (and  is recognized by the international community), asked students  earlier at the same celebration not to allow "force to be more  important than the law." Malval, in the presence of the  diplomatic corps that went to his house to offer support,  reiterated (?his rejection of) Jonassaint's "illegal" regime.</p>

			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Election 1992: True-blue loyalty wearing thin - Media Watch ARE the Tories being maltreated by the press? The very question sounds a bit of an April Fool given the political bent of the bulk of Britain's tabloids. Yet yesterday at the end of another less-than-uplifting Conservative news conference, that was the view of one disgruntled spin doctor who claimed that Mr Neil Kinnock was undergoing softer questioning than his Tory opponent. Perhaps there is a case to answer. But it is hard to make a judgment about unfair treatment - if, indeed, there is such - without accepting the natural imbalances that stem from a three-term government on the defensive and an Opposition with its tail up. Morale is all. And though there is barely more than a statistical blur between the two parties in the polls, the contrast in mood between the camps has had its consequences. Two examples emerged yesterday. In the morning Mr Trevor Kavanagh, political editor of The Sun, asked why the prime minister was raising the dangers of a hung parliament at a time when his party was promising an outright victory. Before the question was even out an irritated Mr Major felt forced to interrupt him. In the afternoon a hostile reporter shouted a question at Mr Kinnock, demanding to know why he had refused an interview for the 5m readers of the Daily Mail. Before the Labour leader had time to respond, a chorus of knowing laughter from his supportive audience of business people and academics made a serious response redundant. 'I think you have got your answer,' Mr Kinnock replied to a stoney-faced questioner who clearly thought he had not. Labour's media campaign has been a mixture of fast footwork, good planning and good luck. The shadow Budget - the party's opening shot - combined all three. By putting up the stolid Mr John Smith to tough out the hard number-crunching questions with the economics correspondents, Mr Kinnock escaped the ordeal for which he is widely deemed least well equipped. The luck came when the Conservative reply was to centre on the iniquity of penalising those on Pounds 21,000-plus a year, rather than to pick away at the Budget's seams. At the outset, too, Mr Jack Cunningham, the campaign master of ceremonies, made ruthlessly clear he was allowing no supplementary questions: a draconian measure that, nonetheless, made palpable hits well nigh impossible. With the Conservatives' two key themes - 'You Can't Trust Labour', and, ditto, Mr Kinnock - both couched in negatives it should have been clear to experienced media manipulators that their raw material would run thin over four weeks. So it has proved. When the charge of disloyalty to the cause was put to one rat-packer from the Tory tabloids yesterday, his reply was splenetic. 'What are we meant to do? We have been attacking Kinnock for eight years, it is as exciting as cold potato,' he said. 'The fact is Kinnock on the run is yesterday's news. The Tories on the run is a real story.' Whatever Labour might say, there is no question that their leader has been sheltered to some extent from the worst of the press rottweilers. What is more, there have been more than a few blunders, but luck has repeatedly seemed to fall the people's party's way. In the now infamous Jennifer's Ear saga, the high emotion of Mr Kinnock's press secretary's tearful confession at the microphone was good television that may actually have worked in Labour's favour. By contrast the same day, poor Mr William Waldegrave, as innocent as a lamb, appeared to be thrown to the wolves with not a protective, shepherding Patten or Wakeham in sight. When the pack smells blood, the wisest course for the wounded is either to bluff it out - 'A two-point margin will simply dissolve in the privacy of the voting booth, dear boy' - or to go to ground. Whingeing does not wash.</p>

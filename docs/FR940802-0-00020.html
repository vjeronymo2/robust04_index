			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed renewable oxygenate requirement would be applied in conjunction with the reformulated gasoline program. It did not alter the performance standards or other provisions for the reformulated gasoline outlined in the final rulemaking for reformulated gasoline. In addition, the proposal did not mandate the use of any particular oxygenate, but rather ensured some minimum use of the class of oxygenates deemed renewable, defined in the proposal as ethanol and methanol from renewable sources, and their ether derivatives. This proposal was designed to supplement and not negate the Agreement in Principle arrived at through regulatory negotiation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA received over 12,000 comments in response to the renewable oxygenate proposal. The vast majority of these comments were letters supporting the proposal written by farmers, ethanol producers, and their supporters. Several hundred responses containing detailed, substantive, technical comments were received from representatives of the oil industry, the ethanol industry, corn farming and other agricultural interests, methanol producers, environmental groups, federal agencies, and state and local governments. Some of these comments supported the proposal while others opposed it. Detailed responses to many of the comments are provided in subsequent sections of this preamble and in the Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) in the docket.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The remainder of this preamble is organized into the following sections:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> II.

Overview of the Renewable Oxygenate Requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is hereby promulgating a renewable oxygenate requirement for reformulated gasoline similar to that proposed on December 15, 1993 (58 FR 68343, December 27, 1993). EPA believes that this action will ensure that the requirements for the reformulated gasoline program promulgated on December 15, 1993 (59 FR 7716, February 16, 1994) are consistent with existing government programs and initiatives supporting renewable fuels. For many years, both Congress and the Executive Branch have promoted through various actions the use of renewable fuels and the development of the renewable fuels industry for various energy, economic, environmental, and agricultural policy objectives. Renewable fuels have been viewed as a key element of policies to enhance domestic energy security, reduce oil imports, conserve fossil energy resources, and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Congress, along with present and past Administrations, has supported these goals through a variety of mechanisms. The Departments of Energy (DOE) and Agriculture (USDA) have invested hundreds of millions of dollars over the past 20 years to research and develop renewable fuel feedstocks and production techniques. Congress has supported the increased use of renewable fuels since the late 1970's through various legistative actions. The Energy Security Act of 1980 established a number of federal policies to expand fuel ethanol production and use. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 stated the intent of Congress to expand ethanol use. Under the Alternative Motor Fuels Act (AMFA) of 1988, the Alternative Fuels Council identified a significant role for ethanol. The National Energy Policy Act (EPACT) of 1992 includes provisions to stimulate the use of a wide-range of alternative (nonpetroleum) fuels, including several renewable fuels. Congress and prior Administrations have also stimulated renewable fuel use through mechanisms such as the 1.0 psi volatility waiver in the CAAA for gasoline (other than reformulated gasoline) blended with ethanol (the major renewable fuel in use today), the oxygen content requirements of the wintertime oxygenated gasoline and reformulated gasoline programs, and various economic incentives such as tax credits since 1978 (currently equal to 54 cents per gallon of renewable fuel).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These programs, combined with additional tax incentives in many states and continued innovation in production techniques, have helped the renewable fuels industry develop and grow. It has become economically attractive to add ethanol to conventional gasoline in many areas of the country, primarily by splash-blending ethanol with gasoline. This process involves mixing ethanol into finished gasoline at the terminal. (Due to materials compatibility concerns and the hygroscopic properties of ethanol, ethanol generally is not added into the existing gasoline distibution system at the refineries.) The resulting ethanol blend, commonly known as gasohol, has higher volatility than either the ethanol or the original gasoline in isolation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

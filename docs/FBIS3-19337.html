			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, March 16 (AFP) -- French Prime Minister  Edouard Balladur said Wednesday [16 March] that the European  Union's [EU] differences over voting rights for new EU members  should not penalize new EU members such as Sweden.    Speaking at a dinner in honour of Sweden's King Karl XVI  Gustav, Balladur said Paris would continue to work "towards  finding acceptable solutions" to the problems over voting rights  in an enlarged EU.    He was referring in particular to British refusal to give  way  in a row over how to change the voting rules in ministerial  councils -- the EU's main decision-making organs -- to take  account of the four new members.    Balladur conceded that the agreement signed on March 1  setting out the terms of Sweden's admission to the Union "like  all agreements, is not perfect." But he insisted it was "good  for the Union and for Sweden."    The French prime minister added that economic relations  between France and Sweden should not be tainted by the "failure"  of the merger between carmakers Renault and Volvo.    He said the joint venture, which broke down earlier this  year, "could have been a good adventure."    Sweden is applying for membership along with Norway, Finland  and Austria. If all four countries join the Union would be  boosted to 16 members, possibly as early as the start of next  year.    Earlier Wednesday, some 20 leading Swedish businessmen,  accompanied by the king, met their French counterparts at the  National Council of French Employers.    The two groups discussed boosting cooperation, reinforcing  European competitiveness and the economic situation in Sweden,  Council officials told a press conference.</p>

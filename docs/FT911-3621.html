			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / UK Company News: Bridgend considers offer in Cowan de Groot battle A BATTLE for control of Cowan de Groot is in the offing after Bridgend Group, the distribution, leisure and property concern, announced it was considering making a cash offer for the toys, electrical components, and household goods company. Bridgend had earlier purchased 1.15m shares in Cowan, lifting its holding to 9.98 per cent. The move comes as a response to last week's agreed share-exchange offer from Wilton Group, chaired by Mr Michael Buckley, who also heads Cowan. Bridgend had earlier unveiled a 74 per cent expansion in taxable profits for 1990. The outcome - Pounds 1.06m against Pounds 608,000 - included a nine-month contribution from the Woodington leisure and property group purchased in March 1990. Interest charges took more at Pounds 819,000 (Pounds 549,000). Turnover totalled Pounds 7.85m (Pounds 3.87m on continuing operations). Earnings per share on the sharply increased capital emerged at 3.5p (3.1p). A recommended final dividend of 0.8p brings the total for the year to 1.2p (1p).</p>

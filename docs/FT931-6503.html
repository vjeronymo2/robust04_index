			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / UK Gilts: Adjustment in perception of inflation trends THE SLOW but steady rally in gilts is starting to attract attention. It indicates the degree to which perceptions about long-term inflation trends in the UK have changed over the past month. Since late January, yields for 10-year gilts have come down by about 50 basis points from 8.2 per cent to around 7.7 per cent, their lowest level for 21 years. The reduction in yields for 20-year bonds has been even more marked, with a fall of 90 basis points, while the fall at the five-year mark has been about 70 basis points. According to Mr George Magnus, international economist at S . G. Warburg Securities, the downward movement in yields underlines how gilt practitioners are taking a sanguine view on price pressures in the UK economy over. That fits in with the fragile state of much of the world economy, with demand pressures and consequently inflationary pressures extremely muted. These trends have depressed yields for government bonds in most markets in the past month. While the investment return on gilts rose by a healthy 2 per cent during February, the performance of Japanese, German and French bonds was slightly better, at between 2.2 per cent and 2.3 per cent. The return for US bonds was somewhat lower at 1.9 per cent, according to calculations by Warburg Securities. Economic data published in the UK during the past week have done little to alter the view that any economic recovery will be slow and protracted. Economists have tended to ignore indications that the M0 measure of the money supply is rising at above the Treasury's target rate, a development which would normally be taken as a sign of inflationary pressures. According to preliminary estimates based on Bank of England figures, M0 rose in February by a year-on-year rate of between 4.2 per cent and 4.6 per cent. Confirmation of these figures, due later today, would make last month the second month running in which the measure has risen at above the 4 per cent year-on-year target. However, many in the gilt market accept the explanation that recent cuts in interest rates have reduced the incentive for consumers and businesses to hold money in bank accounts. As a result, more funds have found their way into notes and coins - the main constituents of the M0 measure. Over the longer term, worries remain that the Pounds 50bn or so of government borrowing expected in 1993-94 will lead to such a large volume of gilt issues from the Bank of England that yields along the yield curve will be pushed up to an unacceptably high level. According to Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Bank, the government is making a strategic mistake by issuing most new gilts in the form of long-dated bonds which threaten to cause 'unnecessarily high long yields'. His view is that - in order to reduce the threat of what he calls a 'financial crisis' - the Bank of England should switch more issues into a mixture of short-dated gilts, National Savings bonds, index-linked gilts and foreign currency debt. He reckons this would ensure long-dated yields did not go too high, helping to bring down the long-term costs of borrowing and aiding economic recovery in Britain over the next few years. According to calculations by Mr Neil Williams at the London office of Japanese investment house Daiwa, the government is likely to overfund the public sector borrowing requirement in 1992-93 by about Pounds 4.5bn, meaning that cash of roughly this amount will go towards funding the 1993-94 PSBR. That news should be generally positive for the gilt market. It should depress the volume of issues in the coming financial year. More goods news for the gilt market would come from any government announcement that the full-funding rule is to be abandoned, meaning that purchases by banks and building societies of gilts would count towards financing the PSBR. While many gilts specialists have been pressing for some time for a change in the rules, there are confident expectations that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, may indeed announce an end to full funding in the March 16 Budget, on the grounds that the switch would boost the money supply and so help an economic upturn.</p>

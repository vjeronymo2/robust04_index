			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Fracturing Janata Dal"] </F>   [Text] It is natural for the Janata Dal leaders to be upset  and angry at the way Mulayam Singh has moved 10 Janata Dal  legislators who supported his government into his party. This  anger is reflected in the resolution sent by the U.P. [Uttar  Pradesh] unit of the Janata Dal to the party's national  president Bommai. It asked permission for the state unit of the  party to take back the endorsement it had given to the Mulayam  Singh government. However, a decision on this resolution is not  expected soon because of the uncertainties and problems within  the Janta Dal. One reason is that the disintegration of the  Janta Dal has just begun, and even the party leaders do now know  how many legislators will be left within the party in the end.  They expressed fear that some of the remaining 17 Janata Dal  legislator might join Mulayam Singh Yadav's Samajwadi Party.  Another half dozen legislators are expected to follow Ajit Singh  into the Congress Party. They were waiting until now because the  one-third number required to avoid breaking the party-deserting  law was not available. Now, in the shrunken Janata Dal, their  number will be about one-third of the party. The other  obstruction Janata Dal leaders' making a final decision about  Mulayam Singh Yadav government is that even V.P. Singh himself  is said to be in support of making Mulayam Singh stronger. Some  other members believe that the 10 legislators who deserted the  Janta Dal had his blessings.    The disintegration of the Janata Dal is believed to be a  foregone conclusion. The legislators who have joined Mulayam  Singh were believed to be ready to go there from the very  beginning. It was Mulayam Singh who was waiting for the right  time for this division to occur. One reason for this wait was he  did not want to help the legislators who were waiting to form  one-third [of legislators] so they could jump to the Congress  party. However, seeing the attitude of the Bahujan Samaj Party  and then of the Congress Party recently, he felt that his  government was in a precarious situation and he could be forced  to have new elections any time. Mulayam Singh, on getting this  feeling, started to strengthen his position among the  Samajwadis, Yadavs, and Muslims. To this end, the first division  was created in the Communist Party of India followed by the  division in the Janata Dal. The leaders frustrated with Mulayam  Singh's strategy have accused him of trying to steal some  Bahujan Samaj Party and Congress Party legislators also.  However, this is neither possible nor practical. First, because  it will not be possible for him to convince one-third of the  legislators to defect. Second, Mulayam Singh's government cannot  survive even one day by making either the Bahujan Samaj Party or  the Congress Party angry.</p>

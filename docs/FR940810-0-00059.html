			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> David Kirby of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory stated his belief that:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> I'm not sure if the analytical methodology will be able to support this due to the level of accuracy that's normally associated with trying to take samples under the normal procedures at that level.'' (Tr. 105)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> NIOSH too testified that ``[i]n NIOSH's judgment, the establishment of a PEL or an action level below 0.1 fiber per cc for most industrial or construction work sites would be difficult at this period of time'' (Tr. 215). Additional doubt was voiced by the chairman of the Shipyard Employment Standards Advisory Committee, ``*&blank;*&blank;* an action level, that is 0.05 fibers per cc, is not appropriate or reasonable due to inconsistencies and non-reproducibility with the sampling and analytical methodology'' and noted concern that shipyard environments were especially likely to have high levels of background dust which could overload sampling devices, making determinations at that level more difficult (Tr. 345). Other commenters supported the proposed deletion of an action level (Ex. 7&hyph;2, 7&hyph;39, 7&hyph;99,7&hyph;104, 7&hyph;120, 7&hyph;146).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Asbestos <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1992 OSHA amended the definition of ``asbestos'' from the 1986 standards. The non-asbestiform varieties of the minerals actinolite, tremolite and anthophyllite are no longer included in the definition of asbestos. In 1986 OSHA determined that although tremolite, actinolite and anthophyllite exist in different forms, all forms of these minerals would continue to be regulated. Following promulgation of the rule, several parties requested an administrative stay of the standard claiming that OSHA improperly included non-asbestiform minerals. A temporary stay insofar as the standards apply to the non-asbestos forms of tremolite, actinolite and anthophyllite was granted and the Agency initiated rulemaking, proposing to remove these forms from the scope of the asbestos standards. Following a public comment period and public hearing, OSHA issued its final decision to delete non-asbestiform tremolite, anthophyllite and actinolite from the scope of the asbestos standards (57 FR 24310, June 8, 1992). The Agency, in evaluating the record, found that ``evidence is lacking to conclude that non-asbestiform tremolite, anthophyllite and actinolite present the same type or magnitude of health effect as asbestos,'' and that the failure to regulate them as asbestos does not present a significant risk to employees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Classification of Asbestos Work (Classes I&hyph;IV) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the Construction and Shipyard Employment Standards, OSHA is adding definitions for four classes of activities which trigger different provisions in the standard. Those activities presenting the greatest risk are designated Class I work, with decreasing risk potential attaching to each successive class. The Construction and Shipyard Employment Standards regulate Class I, II and III work; all three standards regulate Class IV work.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Class I'' work is defined as activities involving the removal of thermal system insulation and sprayed-on or troweled-on or otherwise applied surfacing ACM (asbestos-containing material) and PACM (presumed asbestos-containing material); ``Class II asbestos work'' is defined as removal of ACM or PACM which is not TSI or surfacing ACM or PACM; ``Class III asbestos work'' is defined as repair and maintenance operations which are likely to disturb ACM, or PACM; Class IV operations are custodial and housekeeping operations where minimal contact with ACM and/or PACM may occur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Class I asbestos work involves removal of surfacing materials sprayed or troweled or otherwise applied to surfaces, and removal of thermal system insulation. Surfacing materials include, for example, decorative plaster on ceilings or acoustical ACM on decking or fireproofing on structural members. Thermal system insulation includes, for example, ACM applied to pipes, boilers, tanks and ducts. Based on the record, OSHA has determined that the prevalence of these materials and their likelihood of significant fiber release when disturbed, requires rigorous control methods which OSHA has set out in the standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Class II asbestos work involves removal of any other asbestos-containing material_which is not TSI or surfacing ACM. Examples of Class II work are removal of floor or ceiling tiles, siding, roofing, transite panels. EPA refers to these materials as ``miscellaneous ACM'' in the ``Green Book.'' (Ex. 1&hyph;183) Work practices and other control measures to be employed in removing these materials are discussed later in this preamble under the methods of compliance section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Class III asbestos work are defined as repair and maintenance activities involving intentional disturbance of ACM/PACM. Class III is limited to incidental cutting away of small amounts (less than a single standard waste bag) of ACM/PACM, for example, to access an electrical box for repair.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first three classes of asbestos work are intended to cover the kinds of asbestos work which under the 1986 construction standard were designated ``asbestos removal, demolition, and renovation operations,'' including ``small-scale, short-duration operations, such as pipe repair, valve replacement, installing electrical conduits, installing or removing drywall, roofing, and other general building maintenance or renovation.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

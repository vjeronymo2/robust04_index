			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Letter: Swings and roundabouts Sir, It was amazing to see David Butler using words such as 'distort' and 'aberrations' to describe local government election results that deviated from a uniform national swing (April 11). These elections are not national opinion polls; nor are they designed to select MPs. They are to elect local councillors. People do not always vote the same way in local elections as they do in a general election; at least a fifth vary their vote. Local issues, such as the poll tax and standards of service, can produce very different swings in different areas. These variations are not aberrations or distortions. A uniform national swing in such elections would be an aberration. George Jones, professor of government, London School of Economics and Political Science, Houghton Street, WC2</p>

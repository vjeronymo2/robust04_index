			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Johannesburg Jan 4 SAPA -- The Freedom Alliance [FA]  on Tuesday stopped short of committing itself to the April 27  election but said constitutional amendments affecting regions  could still secure its participation. The FA -- a conservative  grouping that includes the Inkatha Freedom Party, the Afrikaner  Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front], the Conservative Party,  Bophuthatswana and the Ciskei -- was responding to a  government/ANC [African National Congress] proposal that the FA  commit itself to the electoral process ahead of changes to the  constitution. The proposal was made in talks between the three  groupings on December 21 last year.    In a statement issued a day after FA leaders met in  Pretoria,  the FA said it had already committed itself to an all-inclusive  agreement through peaceful negotiations if its amendments to the  constitution were included in a minimum package. It urged  government and the ANC to proceed immediately with negotiations  on its proposals.    The statement said its constitutional proposals included  provisions for self-determination of peoples on a territorial  basis; the powers, functions and financial affairs of provinces;  and separate ballot papers for elections for different levels of  government. "The issue of a single ballot paper specifically  undermines the democratic foundations of the system of  proportional representation and the individual voter's right to  choose.    "The FA and its leaders reiterate that for any such  agreement  to be reached, it should immediately be effected through formal  amendments to the constitution of 1993, failing which agreement  and/or consequent implementation, there cannot be any  commitment."</p>

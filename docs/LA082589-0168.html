			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> SWEDISH HOCKEY STAR FACES EUROPE BAN, LAWSUIT IF HE STAYS WITH KINGS  </P> <P> Swedish hockey star Mikael Lindholm could be suspended from playing in Europe  for life and sued with breach of contract if he decides to continue his career  with the Los Angeles Kings, it was reported today.  </P> <P> Lindholm, 24, who has played two years for Brynas and was under contract with  the Swedish Elite League club, signed a two-year deal with the Kings earlier  this summer. But the June 30 deadline for transfers between Sweden and the NHL  had already passed when he signed the contract.  </P> <P> Brynas asked for $121,000 in compensation but reportedly will not receive  anything from the Kings, the Aftonbladet newspaper said.  </P> <P> "Mikael is tied by a contract with Brynas, and the NHL has honored those  throughout the years. I think (NHL President) John Ziegler will stop this,"  Swedish Hockey Federation President Richard Fagerlund was quoted by Aftonbladet  as saying. Fagerlund said he met Ziegler in London last weekend.  </P> <P> Lindholm, a winger, says he will travel to Ottawa next Sunday to join the  Kings' preseason training camp despite risking a lifetime ban from playing in  Europe.  </P></p>

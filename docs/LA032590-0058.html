			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SAVVY TRAVELER: FREQUENT-FLIER MILES COMPLICATED, ALTHOUGH NOT IMPOSSIBLE,  TO SPEND;  </P> <P> AIRLINES: WHAT LOOKED LIKE AN INGENUOUS MARKETING PLAN BACKFIRED WHEN  FREQUENT-FLIERS SUDDENLY BEGAN CASHING IN TRIPLE MILEAGE AWARDS. TO COMPENSATE,  CARRIERS HAVE CHANGED THEIR RULES.  </P> <P> The madness started two years ago when Delta Airlines thought it had discovered  a marketing bonanza. The airline sent letters to its frequent-flier program  members announcing a special mileage bonus deal: For each member flying Delta  and using an American Express credit card, Delta would award triple mileage.  </P> <P> It seemed like a profitable arrangement for both Delta and American Express.  The airline would get passengers and American Express would get ticket sales.  </P> <P> But before the Delta deal got off the ground, Eastern Airlines tried a little  one-upmanship. Eastern announced that anyone who flew Eastern, regardless of  the form of payment, would receive triple mileage.  </P> <P> The war commenced. Within days, every major U.S. airline got caught up in the  triple-mileage madness. In short order, travelers didn't have to be frequent  fliers to rack up big mileage in record time.  </P> <P> That's the good news. But what can you do with those miles?  </P> <P> The airlines had always defended the mileage programs within their industry as  cost-effective, because of low redemption levels. While no specific figures are  available, three senior airline officials of competing airlines told me that  only 5% to 7% of all miles earned are ever redeemed.  </P> <P> One reason redemption levels had been low was that those who earned high  mileage had flown so frequently they were probably the last ones eager to get  on a plane again. Another reason may have been that frequent fliers seemed more  interested in reaching the next award level than in cashing in their existing  miles.  </P> <P> Thanks to triple mileage offers, those award levels were reached much faster  than anyone anticipated. Suddenly, record numbers of passengers were cashing in  their miles for free or discount trips. What had looked like a profitable  marketing idea had turned into a potential disaster.  </P> <P> The airlines already had agreed to a mandate by a number of state attorney  generals not to change eligibility or mileage levels without sufficient notice  to members, so changing award levels was out of the question.  </P> <P> But airlines, suddenly confronted with the numbers -- a significant  accumulation of unredeemed miles -- have begun to significantly change the  bonus game.  </P> <P> Do the words "blackouts" and "capacity controls" ring a bell? If you've tried  to redeem any of your awards, then you know these terms well. More than ever,  the airlines want to control when you fly and where you fly, even the routing  of those flights you can get on using a bonus award ticket.  </P> <P> For example: You've earned an award ticket to Hawaii, and you call the  participating airline to book your seats, only to discover that "there are no  mileage award seats available on your flight."  </P> <P> That doesn't necessarily mean the flight is sold out. What it does mean is that  the airline has severely limited the number of free seats that can be booked on  popular routes. On some Hawaii flights, airlines have allowed only two seats  per flight to be awarded to frequent flier redeemers.  </P> <P> Does this mean you are out of luck if you didn't get one of those seats and you  want to go to Hawaii? Not necessarily. If a reservations agent tells you that  no award seats are available, but that there are seats available on the flight  itself, ask to speak to a supervisor.  </P> <P> A frequent-flier program exists, after all, to reward passenger loyalty. A  gentle reminder to a supervisor of your loyalty can sometimes result in an  agent overriding his or her airline's computer and issuing you a ticket.  </P> <P> The latest frequent-flier bonus, called "one free for three," good through  April 6, promises a free ticket if you fly three round trips between now and  then.  </P> <P> But read the fine print carefully. United and American, for example, offer the  deal if you fly three round trips costing at least $98. But the resulting free  ticket is good only in the continental United States and only in the fall, and  there are holiday blackouts and other restrictions.  </P> <P> Continental offers the deal after only two round trips. But the qualifying  fares must be at least $196 each. To make matters worse, qualifying trips must  be taken between a Sunday and a Friday. (What this means is, you can't book an  excursion fare on Continental that requires a Saturday night stay, which  usually means a lower air fare.) Again, check out when you can use the free  ticket you've earned.  </P> <P> If you're a member of Northwest's frequent-flier program, called "Worldperks,"  don't be surprised to find an occasional free ticket in the mail. That's  Northwest's way of disposing of accumulated mileage.  </P> <P> The airline now automatically sends its program members tickets when they reach  20,000-mile award levels. But each ticket has an expiration date, as well as a  list of blackout dates and other restrictions.  </P> <P> There are some airlines that have somehow managed to stay out of the  frequent-flier craziness.  </P> <P> "We've watched all this frequent flier stuff with a certain amount of amusement  and a great amount of concern," says Herbert Legner, deputy vice president of  Austrian Airlines.  </P> <P> "We decided that a frequent-flier program is a good idea if you're the first  one and the only one. After that it becomes an expensive headache."  </P> <P> Still, when Austrian Airlines recently decided to enter the U.S. market (with  nonstop flights between New York and Vienna), it reluctantly started a  frequent-flier program. But instead of awarding free tickets on Austrian  Airlines, the program rewards fliers with cash in the form of "MCO" tickets.  MCO stands for "Miscellaneous Charge Order," and is a negotiable form of  airline currency.  </P> <P> The Austrian program rewards "cash" based on mileage; MCO tickets are issued  when a member's account rises above $400. The "cash" can then be used as credit  toward the purchase of tickets on virtually any major airline in the world.  </P> <P> Cathay Pacific has also managed to avoid frequent-flier programs. The Hong  Kong-based carrier, while a partner in other U.S. airline programs, offers no  real mileage program to its regular passengers.  </P> <P> "We're happy about that," said Peter Sutch, Cathay's deputy chairman and chief  executive officer. "These programs have reached ludicrous heights in the United  States, and sooner or later that unredeemed mileage has to be accounted for on  your balance sheet."  </P> <P> One more thing. While no one was looking, triple mileage snuck back in. Alaska  Airlines is offering triple mileage to its program members through April 6.  </P> <P> Pan Am, eager to drum up much-needed business during these slow off-season  months, is offering triple miles to its frequent fliers until April 15. Any Pan  Am or Pan Am Express flight within the United States (including Hawaii), and to  Bermuda, the Caribbean or Mexico (even within the Caribbean) qualifies for  triple mileage.  </P> <P> On flights between the United States and Europe, India, Pakistan or Africa,  between Europe and India, Pakistan or Africa or on Pan Am flights within  Europe, the airline awards double the actual miles flown.  </P></p>

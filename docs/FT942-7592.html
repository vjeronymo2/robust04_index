			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Accountancy TV did not cover costs Accountancy Television, the defunct training service for accountants, was not able even to cover its production and marketing costs, the receivers said yesterday. The service generated accumulated losses of Pounds 2.2m according to details of the draft management accounts for the year to December 31 last year, which were distributed to creditors earlier this month. Mr Lee Manning of Buchler Phillips, one of the joint receivers, said it was unlikely that any unsecured creditors would receive dividends, because there would probably not be enough money to pay off a charge worth nearly Pounds 60,000 over the assets secured last year by Lloyds Bank.</p>

			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / International Company News: Mobil declines on fall in oil and natural gas prices MOBIL, the US oil and gas group, yesterday unveiled dramatically lower first-quarter earnings, reflecting soft prices for natural gas and crude oil and a charge to cover job cuts. Net income for the first three months of 1992 dropped to Dollars 127m or 28 cents a share from Dollars 710m or Dollars 1.73 a share last year. Stripping out Dollars 86m or restructuring costs in the latest quarter, Mobil's operating income declined to Dollars 213m from Dollars 710m a year earlier. During the latest quarter, Mobil said it would cut up to 1,000 jobs from US exploration and production by the end of the year and took charges of Dollars 105m to cover both the job reductions and an unproductive well in Peru. Mr Allen Murray, chairman, blamed the slow rate of economic growth worldwide for the unsatisfactory first-quarter earnings. 'Our worldwide facilities turned in a very good operating performance but oil and gas prices decreased and downstream and chemical margins were squeezed.' On Wall Street, shares in Mobil edged Dollars  3/8 lower to Dollars 61 3/4 at close of trading. Mr Paul Mlotok, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said he had expected a poor first quarter and had not readjusted his full-year earnings estimate of Dollars 3.30 a share, 'but my estimate is already below average'. 'We knew that refining and marketing earnings would be down because last year's eastern hemisphere results were at record levels.' Exploration and production also fell because oil prices have fallen by around Dollars 3 a barrel and natural gas has fallen about 40 cents per thousand cubic feet. Mobil's earnings from exploration and production fell to Dollars 175m, including a one-time charge of Dollars 57m, against earnings of Dollars 371m a year ago. The company's earnings from marketing and refining tumbled to Dollars 52m from Dollars 442m. Looking to the second quarter Mr Murray said 'it is still too early for substantial optimism'. Analyst Mr Michael Young, of Smith Barney Harris Upham, said while the overall results met his expectations, the drop in Mobil's operating segments was disturbing. 'They made up the shortfall through lower corporate and other costs, but I feel that Mobil's results were weaker than they should have been, even give the poor industry conditions.'</p>

			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAPID-FIRE BUYING OF ASSAULT GUNS MARKS DEADLINE OF NEW LAW  </P> <P> Two hours before the 9 p.m. closing time at Turner's Outdoorsman in West  Covina, the gun counter was crowded with people looking to buy military-type  assault weapons.  </P> <P> "After this," explained Ruben Diaz, a mechanic, "we won't be able to get them  anymore."  </P> <P> In all, 19 customers bought semiautomatic weapons at the store Wednesday --  thus beating a midnight deadline, after which the ground rules will change for  buying such guns in California.  </P> <P> By buying Wednesday, owners can register their guns and keep them without a  problem. After midnight, a restrictive permit procedure became effective under  a new state law, virtually banning acquisition of 50 different semiautomatic  rifles, pistols and shotguns.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reasons for Purchase  </P> <P> Diaz, who described himself as a gun enthusiast, said he was not looking for a  better way to protect his home -- "to me, they are the same as any other gun,"  he confided -- but simply for another weapon to fire out in the desert.  </P> <P> Others said they were, in effect, taking advantage of the law by making  investments in weapons that are going to be in short supply.  </P> <P> "I'm just going to sell it," said one young customer, who declined to give his  name after bought a Bullpup AK-47 for $799.99.  </P> <P> Many of the guns were going for twice as much as they did just weeks ago. But  that didn't seem to bother a short man wearing dark glasses, a purple sports  shirt and blue jeans, who peeled off hundred-dollar bills to buy a $600 assault  rifle.  </P> <P> "There's no doubt they will increase in value," said another buyer.  </P> <P> Turner's Outdoorsman in West Covina is one of a chain of nine stores operated  by one of Southern California's largest gun dealers.  </P> <P> Reports from around the state indicated that sales were booming elsewhere as  well -- except in Los Angeles and several other Southern California cities that  have banned sale of semiautomatic weapons.  </P> <P> "We were very busy on Thursday and Friday last week, and we are very busy  today, " said Mike Lum, vice president of Chino-based Turner's Outdoorsman.  "Over a year ago at this time, we are probably up four- or five-fold.  </P> <P> In San Leandro, Tony Cucchiara of Traders Sports, the state's largest retail  gun dealer, told Associated Press that customers are buying "anything that  looks ugly, that looks like an assault weapon. . . . There are a lot of people  buying these things for souvenirs. Little old men and little old ladies are  walking into the store, saying they want to buy an AK-47."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Permit Applications  </P> <P> Californians can still legally purchase semiautomatic weapons under the  legislation signed by the governor last week. But those who buy between today  and Jan. 1 must apply for a permit from the state to keep them. And those  denied permits -- similar to one required for machine guns -- will be required  to dispose of their guns in some way, such as selling them to authorized  owners.  </P> <P> The provision of the law banning sales of many semiautomatic weapons goes into  effect Jan. 1.  </P> <P> Lum speculated that, in practice, it will be virtually impossible for gun  owners to get permits during the next six months. Under the state's criteria,  they must have "good cause" to acquire the weapons, such as using them for law  enforcement purposes or selling or renting them to motion picture studios.  </P> <P> "They are not going to give you a permit," he declared.  </P> <P> Will Hunsaker, assistant manager of the West Covina store, said the Turner's  chain will "probably sell the (remaining) guns to dealers out of state."  </P> <P> Gun store operators in Los Angeles were doing business as usual Wednesday,  without a last-minute rush. Sale of military-style assault weapons has been  prohibited since March 1 under an ordinance approved unanimously by the City  Council in February.  </P></p>

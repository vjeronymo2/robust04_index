			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Religion: are we better off without it?: The age-old dispute between science and religion has resurfaced. But science has the moral high ground Why is it that a society that has reaped such enormous benefits from science should have developed such a widespread suspicion and dislike of it? Consider, for example, the following from a columnist in the The Oldie magazine. 'Modern science has become a lucrative, prestigious racket, maintaining its hold over us by force and propaganda . . . It is expensive, dirty and dangerous. It is eating up the world's resources, spreading filth over its surface and creating ever more lethal devices . . . Despite the billions that have been lavished on medical research, there has been . . . no significant reduction in deaths from cancer and heart disease.' This shows all the petulant silliness that has informed much recent anti-science writing, and reflects a widespread outlook, which almost always includes a Christian or Islamic bias. Why has the old dispute between religion and science resurfaced in so crude a form? The reason, I suggest, is that science has come to occupy the high ground of morality, which has prompted bizarre attacks against it. Moral superiority may seem an odd defence against accusations that science is responsible for almost all of the environmental and social problems of the modern world, but the effect of science is not the central issue. It is an old truth that science is neutral, that its applications are as good, or as evil, as people make them. Some recent attacks on science have been more subtle. It has been argued that the neutrality of science means that it is dehumanising. Being neutral, it imposes no spiritual or moral value. It denies the existence of God and rejects any transcendental purpose to justify our existence. It belittles mankind's status in the universe, and threatens a reductionist, materialist interpretation of our thinking and being; it dismisses the possibility of rewards and retribution in an after-life, and enjoins no imperatives towards goodness, kindness, altruism, or even considerate behaviour towards one's fellows. In short, it is amoral as well as inhuman. I will not rehearse the counter-arguments, that science is as spiritually rewarding as a religious experience. Arguments about spirituality are sterile, but those about morality are not. And science is far from being amoral; it imposes a stern, austere morality on its practitioners, one which pervades their lives and results from the fundamental nature of science. Science is a continual linking together of observations and experiences, codified as self-consistent logical structures (catalogues, hypotheses and theories) into what we call knowledge. It requires a particular way of thinking about the world, which we call reasoning. This is not to say that scientific inspiration is necessarily rational; often it is not. But before an observation or concept becomes part of the logical structures of science, it must be seen to be rational when dovetailed into the existing body of knowledge. Those structures are constantly open to challenge and modification, which is the crucial difference between science and religion. There are no dogmas, no absolute certainties, in science; what are thought and spoken of as scientific truths are simply probabilities so high that we can treat them as if they were certainties. Science approaches ever closer to the truth, but never gets there. So for a scientist there is no absolute truth. Why, then, does anyone bother to seek knowledge? For the same reasons that a baby or a puppy explores the world around it; there is no other way. The more we understand our surroundings and can foresee opportunities and events, the safer and happier we feel. This search for what we call scientific truth imposes its own morality of honesty, co-operation and sharing. These virtues are imposed not by priests or mystical authority, but by utterly practical considerations. You do not, as a scientist, advance knowledge or your own reputation if you are guilty of deception, or self-deception; nor if you disregard unwelcome or inconsistent evidence, nor yet if you conceal rather than share data. Why? Because deception, plagiarism and falsification of evidence will be found out, usually very soon; self-deception will engender contempt; concealment, such as failure to publish, will be self-defeating through loss of scientific credit; but above all such behaviour will delay scientific progress. Of course, there are scientific cheats and fraudsters, but they are happily rare. The most common transgression today is probably concealment. It happens for reasons ranging from industrial or military secrecy to gaining an advantage in a race for publication. It rarely amounts to more than a delay in announcing one's findings, and it is always shaming. Fudging results to support a point of view is probably the next most common transgression, but it is rare because every scientist knows it is ultimately pointless. Of course, scientific communities have their share of jealousy, greed, prejudice and envy, but all scientists know that in the end progress depends on openness and the sharing of data. Opinions and convictions may be held as strongly as in any walk of life, but a window of open-mindedness and self-criticism is essential. This becomes a general outlook which can make scientists exasperating to live with; it is also the reason why so few scientists are to be found in politics, or hold religious beliefs. Those scientists who are religious have to think in compartments, closing down for religious thought the critical faculties that they would use for scientific work. Yet in spite of the strong moral foundation of science and the material progress which it has delivered, scientists must be careful not to underestimate the benefits of the world's religions. They have given purpose, morality and social coherence to people's lives. They have nurtured art, learning and literature and, in earlier times, produced the substantial technical and material benefits which stemmed from religious architecture and land use. So if one counts up the benefits of science and religion, the score is roughly equal. But the world's religions have also brought the horrors of human sacrifice, crusades, pogroms and inquisitions. In the modern world this darker side of religion has become dangerous. For unlike science, religion is not neutral; it tells people what to do. And one of the things it tells them is, 'Kill the infidel'. Just consider, for example, Ulster, Yugoslavia, Israel, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Kashmir, Armenia and Azerbaijan to-day; observe Protestant, Catholic, Serbian and Russian Orthodox Christians, Jews, Shia and Suni Moslems, Hindus, Sikhs and minor sects, in their tens and hundreds of thousands, murdering each other, often in revoltingly medieval ways. All in the name of their god or gods. It is sometimes claimed that the conflicts are not religious but ethnic, tribal, nationalist or political. A few surely are - especially in Africa, for example, where genuine tribalism persists - but try asking those who are sniping and shelling in Bosnia, shouting slogans in Tehran and Baghdad, sacking temples in Kashmir, shooting tourists in Egypt, planting bombs in British shopping malls. Some say that these fundamentalist killers are deviants, distorting the true teachings of their religion and perverting its morality; that these modern-day holy wars are a negative fall-out of religion, analogous to the pollution, environmental damage and unethical experiments which disfigure the applications of science. There is something in this, but it does not stand up to close examination. Most religions do indeed forbid killing; a few of the belligerents are mindless thugs, sadistically disobeying this injunction; but most such fighters are ordinary people, following a religious imperative. They find support from their myths and texts, among their priests and their silent co-religionists, because retribution is part of religion. In some devious way they are convinced that they are carrying out their god's will. Therein lies the moral advantage of science. Its morality is incompatible with such imperatives: scientific principles, and logic, cannot be construed as incitement to mass killing, or even individual murder. Science has had its back-sliders: a few scientists have shown themselves capable of murder in the name of research, as happened in Nazi Germany and Japanese prison camps during the second world war. Doubtless, too, there are enthusiastic participants in the current spate of religious conflicts who, in another compartment of their minds, are moral and dedicated scientists. Every walk of life has its aberrants, but can you imagine scientists, in hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands even, arming themselves and murdering, torturing and maiming their fellow beings for some scientific principle or 'truth'? Many people will need religion for decades to come, probably for centuries, because science is comparatively young and the morality it imposes, by example and not precept, is still inaccessible to many people. But to-day religion, with its backbone of retribution, jihad, crusade and battle, presents a threat to mankind that is quite as serious as any of the environmental and social perils attributed to science, and much more immediate. A couple of years ago, I remember a scholar of Byzantine history saying he hoped that 'mankind will soon learn that religion is too important a matter to kill each other about'. It took me two days to realise how tragically mistaken that thought was. I wished him to say: 'If only mankind would learn that religion is too unimportant a matter to kill each other about.'

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 6 (XINHUA) -- Vice Premier Zou  Jiahua today asked the Civil Aviation Administration of China  (CAAC) to institute stricter management and more rigorous  discipline to ensure safer air traffic.    At a meeting convened this morning at the headquarters of  the  CAAC, Zou Jiahua officially announced the appointment of the new  leaders of the CAAC. Chen Guangyi, former provincial party  secretary of Fujian, has been named as director of CAAC, while  Jiang Zhuping, Yan Zhixiang, Li Zhao, Shen Yuankang and Bao  Peide have been appointed as vice-directors.    In his speech, Zou reviewed the development of CAAC since  the  founding of New China, and praised the contributions of CAAC to  the development of the national economy.    But he also pointed out that problems still exist in the  country's civil aviation industry, and that CAAC should  recognize its defects and improve its work.    Zou stressed that civil aviation work should continue to  pursue the guiding principle of "safety first, normal flights  and quality service," which was put forward by the late Premier  Zhou Enlai. Even today the principle still bears immediate  significance.    Zou reiterated the general purpose of civil aviation work,  which is "serving the passengers, serving the development of the  national economy," adding that passengers' opinions are the best  gauge for CAAC's work.    Zou also urged the CAAC to develop a good style of work. The  CAAC staff should be united, realistic, inventive and honest, he  said.    CAAC's new director, Chen Guangyi, also made a speech at the  meeting, saying that the CAAC has much to do to maintain air  safety. All CAAC staff should be inspired with great enthusiasm  to establish a good image in the world for CAAC.    Chen, aged 61, was vice-secretary and governor of Gansu  Province until 1986 when he was transferred to be Communist  Party secretary of Fujian Province. Last month he was appointed  director of CAAC.</p>

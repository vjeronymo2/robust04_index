			<p><P> December 26, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE QUESTION AT SUNKIST: IS FLORIDA RIPE FOR EXPANSION?  </P> <P> Sunkist Growers Inc., the citrus farmers' cooperative whose well-known  trademark has made it a dominant force among Arizona and California growers, is  considering expanding into Florida.  </P> <P> The Sherman Oaks-based cooperative is thinking about selling fruit from Florida  because there's little chance of expanding citrus production in Arizona and  California due to urban encroachment on citrus groves and the skyrocketing  costs of water in the southwest. Florida remains the state with the largest  citrus crop.  </P> <P> The cooperative, projected to do nearly $1 billion in sales in 1989, has sent  three teams of executives and directors to Florida to talk with growers and  packers of lemons, tangerines and grapefruit. A fourth team in January will  visit the state to talk with orange growers.  </P> <P> But Sunkist officials stressed that they haven't yet decided whether to expand  to Florida. "We don't have a consensus even among our current members," said  Russell L. Hanlin, president of Sunkist. "It's too early even to put the  question to them." The cooperative may make a decision next summer, said Curtis  W. Anderson, vice president of member and public relations.  </P> <P> Sunkist is a grower-owned cooperative of about 6,000 citrus farmers in Arizona  and California, who account for about 65% of citrus fruit production in the two  states. The cooperative packs the growers' fruit, advertises and sells it, then  pays the growers most of the proceeds back, minus a fee. For the growers it  saves them the worry of actually marketing their fruit.  </P> <P> In 1988, when Sunkist had revenues of about $887 million, it returned about  $640 million to members, and after Sunkist's costs of $241 million, the  cooperative's retained income was $6 million before taxes.  </P> <P> The cooperative is best known for its sales of fresh fruit under the Sunkist  name, coined by ad men in 1909. But it also was paid about $10 million in 1988  under licensing agreements that allow other companies to use the name. Cadbury  Schweppes Inc., for example, sells Sunkist orange drink.  </P> <P> If Sunkist decides to sell Florida fruit, it would probably not seek new  members there, at least early on. The cooperative would simply charge a fee to  market the citrus and then plow back the profits from selling Florida fruit to  reduce fees for its California and Arizona growers. It could later seek members  in Florida.  </P> <P> The impetus for expanding comes from a need to keep pace with the recent  consolidations of grocery chains. "We don't want to be whip-sawed simply by the  disparity in size between the buyer and the seller," Hanlin said. As the market  chains get bigger they demand lower prices and a more consistent supply of  fruit.  </P> <P> With 33 sales offices throughout North America, Anderson said, Sunkist has  plenty of excess capacity to market more fruit without spending more money.  </P> <P> But California and Arizona -- despite their size -- don't have much room left  for new citrus groves. The two states have lost about 40,000 acres of  citrus-growing land in the last five to eight years, Anderson said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the high cost of water where there is room to expand -- in places  like the eastern San Joaquin Valley -- makes it unlikely that citrus production  throughout Arizona and California will do more than level out in the next few  years.  </P> <P> In Florida, it's a different story. Although the state lost more than 200,000  acres of citrus groves as a result of freezes in 1983 and 1985, new groves are  being planted, especially in southern Florida. Hanlin said, "We believe as the  Florida crop grows they're going to need some additions to their marketing  facilities."  </P> <P> What does Florida think about Sunkist's idea?  </P> <P> "The citrus industry is growing and there's room for everybody," said Cathy  Clay, a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Citrus, which levies a fee on  growers and spends about $77 million a year advertising the state's fruit.  Florida does have some citrus cooperatives, but none on a scale to match  Sunkist.  </P> <P> Although 94% of Florida-grown oranges and about 57% of its grapefruit wind up  as juice, rather than sold fresh in grocery stores, Sunkist would concentrate  on marketing Florida fruit fresh. That would reflect the cooperative's current  emphasis; about 70% of California and Arizona fruit is sold whole.  </P> <P> Florida's humidity helps produce juicier oranges than those typically grown  here. By comparison, cool nights in California and Arizona make for  better-looking fruit.  </P> <P> Despite the difference in emphasis, there's still a substantial amount of fresh  Florida fruit to be sold. In the 1987-88 season, Florida produced about 46  million cartons of grapefruit for sale fresh compared to California and  Arizona's 14 million.  </P></p>

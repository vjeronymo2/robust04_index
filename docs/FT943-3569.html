			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Survey of Sao Paulo (2): A shift in the centre of gravity - The economy Sao Paulo state remains the capitalist heart of Brazil. But its centre of gravity is gradually shifting from a traditional industrial base towards a diverse service economy responding to companies and consumers in what is easily the country's biggest market. The state's 32m people, about a fifth of Brazil's population, produce 37 per cent of national wealth and a third of the country's exports. Its industrial dominance was built on the state's coffee boom of the last century, which spurred a large influx of mainly European immigrants. Agricultural wealth combined with a growing and dynamic population fuelled industrialisation. This accelerated in the 1950s and 1960s with the arrival of multinational car, chemical and manufacturing companies, attracted by government attempts to spur Brazil's industrial growth. But today, like a heavyweight boxer who has spent too much time in the ring, Sao Paulo's industrial punch is gradually losing its power. Between 1980 and 1991 its economy averaged an annual growth rate of just 0.6 per cent compared to 1.4 per cent for Brazil as a whole, according to Seade, the state's research centre. Sao Paulo's share of national wealth in GDP terms fell from 41 to 37 per cent during the period. The state finance ministry puts Sao Paulo's gross domestic product at Dollars 215bn last year. But Brazil's economic statistics are often unreliable, and output was probably lower. The growth slowdown has been caused because other parts of Brazil, particularly Minas Gerais and Parana in the south-east, are catching up with Sao Paulo and attracting new industrial companies with cheap land, tax incentives and weaker unions. Many Paulistas, as the state's inhabitants are known, welcome the move from the often polluting industrial companies to a more services-based economy. Services increased their share of state domestic product from 50 to 58 per cent between 1980 and 1991 while industry fell from 47 to 38 per cent, according to Seade. Agriculture has also lost importance. From a dominant position in the 1940s, it now accounts for 3-4 per cent of domestic product, though the figure is higher if related industries such as food processing are included. Unemployment has increased from an average annual rate of 8 per cent during 1985-1989 to 12-15 per cent since 1990, according to non-government statistics which include underemployment. The official estimate of unemployment at 5.9 per cent in June is widely agreed to be too low. Job cuts are largely due to a general restructuring in Brazilian industry following the opening of the economy to international competition at the beginning of the decade. For example, the jewel in Sao Paulo's economic crown is the car industry, which accounts for nearly 20 per cent of industrial production. Last year Sao Paulo produced more than two-thirds of Brazil's 1.4m vehicles but with fewer workers than in 1990 when around 900,000 vehicles were made. Meanwhile, General Motors' Brazilian subsidiary is expected to build a new plant for 100,000 vehicles a year outside the state, possibly in neighbouring Minas Gerais. The company decided not to expand its plant in Sao Jose dos Campos, Sao Paulo, because of poor labour relations, though some industry observers believe the financial incentives offered outside Sao Paulo were perhaps more important. Mr Carlos Azzoni, an economist at the University of Sao Paulo and a former planning official in the state government, says: 'Part of the problem has been that the state government has not been as aggressive as others in trying to attract companies.' However, the state government has been preoccupied with financial problems, which have made it difficult to find money to improve the state's infrastructure, traditionally one of Sao Paulo's biggest attractions for companies. Partnerships with the private sector are on the agenda but have so far made limited progress. Some large projects, such as an extension to the city's underground rail network and a clean-up of the river Tiete, are receiving support from multinational agencies. Mr Azzoni argues that improved transport and communications infrastructure in other states has allowed companies to move production out of Sao Paulo, but still retain access to its consumer market. '(Companies) will continue to keep their head offices in Sao Paulo but open new plants where it's cheaper,' he says. The move from industry to services has led to Sao Paulo evolving towards a 'qualitative not a quantitative importance,' says Mr Azzoni. Nowhere in Brazil is there such a concentration of universities, research centres and high tech companies. About 80 per cent of Brazil's scientific and technological research is carried out in Sao Paulo, according to Mr Pedro Paulo Branco, director of Seade. The success of Brazil's current stabilisation plan would give a big boost to Sao Paulo, according to Mr Branco, who says that because of its diverse economy, good infrastructure and well-trained workforce it can recover far more quickly than the national economy. Others believe stabilisation will provide only a short-term industrial turnaround and that Brazil's economic centre of gravity is inevitably dispersing to other regions. Similar doubts exist over the importance of the Mercosul free trade area for the state. Some believe Mercosul will mainly benefit states to the south of Sao Paulo, while others point to the development of a powerful economic axis linking South America's two biggest consumer markets: Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires. Whatever happens, Sao Paulo will still remain in the middle of a hugely important consumer market and industrial region, including Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais to its north and developed states like Parana and Rio Grande do Sul to its south.</p>

			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> 'NEW VISIONS JAZZ' FEATURES BILL COSBY'S GROUP  </P> <P> The latest edition of the "New Visions Jazz" series on VH-1, airing at 8  tonight, is the first of two 55-minute segments devoted mainly to Bill Cosby's  new venture as a jazz producer.  </P> <P> With Ben Sidran as host, the program switches back and forth between  performances by Cosby's group, a couple of Sidran-Cosby dialogues, and clips by  other bands.  </P> <P> Among the latter are a super-busy performance by Branford Marsalis, on soprano  saxophone; Miles Davis, in a medley from his own "Tutu" album, and a very  grainy black-and-white item by Duke Ellington playing "Perdido."  </P> <P> Cosby's own musicians -- David Murray on tenor sax, Don Pullen on piano, Sonny  Sharrock on guitar, Mark Egan on bass and Al Foster on drums -- play the Miles  Davis standard "All Blues" and a long, single-chord vamp in G entitled  "Ursalina." It's all strongly funk-oriented, the kind of music more likely to  appeal to young listeners who are into R&amp;B than to older folks who  regularly watch the Huxtables.  </P> <P> In addition to acting as a sort of cheerleader, looking entranced, saying  "Yeah!" and cuing the band to stop, Cosby talks about the intensity and emotion  involved. Jazz, he says, is like comedy: Robin Williams and Eddie Murphy are  "talking musicians." The analogy may be a little hard to follow, but Cosby is  obviously sincere, and Sidran is duly deferential, comparing him to Miles  Davis.  </P> <P> The best spoken moment is Cosby's opening greeting to the diminutive Sidran, to  whom he says: "Hey, you're taller than I thought." Jazz may not be like comedy,  but some jazz aficionados sure have a way with a quip. LEONARD FEATHER  </P></p>

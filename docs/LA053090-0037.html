			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUBBLE TELESCOPE  </P> <P> So what? Your story (front page, May 21) about the Hubble Space Telescope  getting pictures of a star that is millions of miles away leaves me completely  cold.  </P> <P> After a bunch of scientists had worked for 15 years and spent billions of  taxpayer dollars to develop the cameras and other gear, what do they get but a  couple of white spots on film? Any of us, without a penny spent by the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration, could use a box camera aimed at a couple  of light bulbs and accomplish the same thing.  </P> <P> In my opinion, shared by an untold number of others, it is time to put a stop  to this kind of money wasting. If people in Washington want to spend money, why  don't they aim it at schools, hospitals, housing, roads and reduction of the  national debt that would directly benefit everyone in this country?  </P> <P> JACK WEST  </P> <P> Rancho Palos Verdes  </P></p>

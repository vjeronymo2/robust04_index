			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BEIRUT PRESS MARKS HOSTAGE ANDERSON'S BIRTHDAY  </P> <P> Lebanese newspapers published birthday letters to American Terry A. Anderson on  Saturday, his 43rd birthday and his sixth in captivity. One newspaper reported  that fellow hostage Terry Waite will be freed soon.  </P> <P> Seven newspapers printed birthday greetings to Anderson from his sister, Peggy  Say, his youngest daughter, Sulome, and Madeleine, Sulome's mother. They  published the original English text so that Anderson, who did not know Arabic  when he was kidnaped, would be able to read them if his kidnapers allow him to.  </P> <P> Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for the Associated Press, is the  longest-held of the 11 Western hostages in Lebanon. He was kidnaped March 16,  1985, by a pro-Iranian group known as Islamic Jihad.  </P> <P> The newspaper Al Diyar, meanwhile, said British hostage Terry Waite will be  freed either "by the end of this month or within the first half of the coming  November, at the latest."  </P> <P> The short, front-page report attributed the information to an unnamed security  source. The conservative Al Diyar is not known to have special insight into the  hostage issue, but the report was the latest predicting Waite's release since  Iran and Britain agreed Sept. 27 to restore diplomatic ties.  </P> <P> Waite, 51, an Anglican Church envoy, was kidnaped Jan. 20, 1987, after leaving  his West Beirut hotel to negotiate with representatives of Anderson's  kidnapers. Like Anderson, he is believed to be held by Islamic Jihad.  </P></p>

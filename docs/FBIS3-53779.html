He said: The  truth-seeking minds throughout the world are the targets and  recipients of the message of the Islamic revolution. By playing  a more active role in the international system of information,  we will try to respond to cultural needs.    The head of IRIB then referred to the rapid global  developments in the sphere of communications and information  during the present era when technology is enjoying progress and  the nations are awakening. He said: In view of the nations'  growing inclination towards Islam and idealism, the present  cultural vacuum and the intellectual crisis felt across the  world, and finally the vast amount of propaganda against the  Islamic system, it is clear that the responsibilities of the  radio and television, as the largest media, are very grave.    He stressed that IRIB enjoyed potential talents and  capabilities which could be utilized in a more efficient way so  as to expand the sphere of present activities. He then said  that the operation of the 3d [TV] network and the Radio News  were part of the new efforts aimed at accelerating the process  of news and information broadcasting, and filling the society's  leisure time.    According to our correspondent's report, today's meeting  continued with an address by Mr Hemmati, the deputy head of IRIB  in charge of political affairs. He referred to the change in  attitudes towards radio and television, and underlined the  inevitable need to change the system of news broadcasting in  order to create a greater momentum in the society, strengthen  incentives and mobilize the population to participate in the  reconstruction process.    He said: By reliance on its high level of expertise and  capabilities, IRIB has formulated new plans for expanding field  information gathering and broadcasting. He added: With the  start of the Radio News, which will begin transmission during  the blessed 10-day Fajr celebrations [the anniversary of the  victory of Islamic revolution on 11 Feb 1979], the necessary  means for speedy and regular transmission of news will be  provided.    According to IRIB's deputy in charge of political affairs,  the Radio News programs will be varied, and will cover sports,  scientific, cultural, arts, economic, social and political news  from Iran and abroad.

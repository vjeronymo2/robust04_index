			<p>BFN     [Text] Muhammad Ibrahim, a 29-year-old Syrian citizen, was  detained for 15 days on the orders of the 'Akko Magistrate's  Court. The young man surrendered himself to Israel Defense  Forces forces three days ago.    Our correspondent Yo'el Dar reports that the Syrian man is  suspected of infiltrating Israel. He told the court that he  fled Syria so as to receive medical treatment for scars left on  his body by electric treatments he had been given by Syrian  doctors. The judge ordered that the man be given a medical  examination before a verdict is passed.</p>

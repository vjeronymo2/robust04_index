The State Commission for Restructuring the Economy and the  State Economic and Trade Commission immediately decided to  select around 100 state-owned enterprises and designate them as  experimental units for establishing a modern enterprise system.    In the following two months or so, two kinds of situations  arose in some enterprises:    First, a small number of enterprises volunteered for the  work, wanted to become targets of experiment, and tried every  means to stand in the forefront of deep-going enterprise reform.  Second, a considerable number of enterprises held that, since  the establishment of a modern enterprise system was a huge and  difficult project which dealt with a wide range of issues, they  could not hastily "break a new path" without enough meditation  and certainly of success. Therefore, they took no action in  enterprise reform and wholeheartedly waited for popularization  of experimental units' experience.    Such a situation posed a question: What do most enterprises  do when only a very small number of enterprises are operated as  experimental units in the process of establishing a modern  enterprise system?  <H3>  The Decision Pointed Out Clearly: Do Not Stand By  Unconcerned </H3>   The proposal of establishing a modern enterprise system  marks  a new stage of enterprise reform in our country and embodies  improvement of the overall standard of enterprise reform. The  establishment of a modern enterprise system is a social and  economic systematic project which is very rich in content and  interrelated. It is very difficult to achieve the desired  results and accomplish the set goal if we, as in the past, make  a breakthrough in a single area. The Decision of the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th Central CPC Committee explicitly  pointed out: "To establish a modern enterprise system is an  arduous and complicated undertaking. It requires the  accumulation of experience and creation of the necessary  conditions and should be conducted step by step. It is now  necessary to continue to implement the Law Concerning Industrial  Enterprises Owned by the Whole People and Regulations on  Changing the Management Mechanism of Industrial Enterprises  Owned by the Whole People, and to unreservedly extend to the  enterprises the various rights and responsibilities pertaining  to their own management. It is necessary to strengthen  supervision and control over the state-owned assets possessed by  enterprises and reach the aim of maintaining and increasing the  value of state-owned assets. It is necessary to quicken the pace  of change of the management mechanism and readjustment of the  organizational structure of state-owned enterprises.  Unwarranted pooling of funds, arbitrary requisitions of  donations, and exaction of fees from enterprises must be  resolutely stopped. It is necessary to reduce the financial  burden the enterprises have to bear in supporting social  undertakings. It is necessary to, step by step, make an  inventory of and check the stockpiles and capital of  enterprises, define the property rights, clarify debts  receivable and debts payable, evaluate the assets to verify the  amount possessed by the enterprise legal entities. It is  necessary to create conditions in all respects for state-owned  enterprises to shift steadily to the modern enterprise system."    The content of this part of the decision explicitly told us:  At a time when a small number of enterprises are operated as  experimental units, most enterprises have no reason to stand by  unconcerned, but should rather, as always, accomplish the work  of enterprise reform in various respects. Of course, some  demands of the Decision are set on government departments at all  levels. For example, to make enterprises be truly responsible  for their own management decisions, prevent the "three  unreasonables," and lighten social burdens shouldered by  state-owned enterprises, and all these should be mainly handled  by them. However, the course of deepening enterprise reform  should be, of course, mainly completed by enterprises  themselves. Any kind of pause and break cannot shorten the  course of reform, but rather expends precious time to no avail.    As a matter of fact, as far as this reporter understands,  many leading organs of provinces, municipalities, and autonomous  regions and some industrial departments of the state have a very  clear response to the question of "what do most enterprises do  when a small number of enterprises are operated as experimental  units." For example, at the meeting of leading cadres of  national railways held in mid-January, Minister of Railways Han  Zhubin said when talking about the issue of establishing a  modern enterprise system: At present, we must mainly pay  attention to three things -- bringing into effect the  Regulations and the Implementation Method for Changing the  Management Mechanism of Railway Enterprises; laying a good  foundation and mainly paying close attention to the work of  making an inventory of and check of the stockpiles and capital,  defining the property rights, clarifying debts receivable and  debts payable, and evaluating the assets; and setting up some  units to experiment with the corporate system, gaining  experience, avoiding formalism, and never rushing headlong to  mass action. In another example, at the national metallurgical  work meeting held in early January, Minister of Metallurgical  Industry Liu Qi pointed out when planning the work of deepening  enterprise reform: "At present, we must vigorously make all  kinds of preparations and create conditions for implementing a  modern enterprise system." He said that it was necessary to  continue to implement the Regulations, to make an inventory of  and check of the stockpiles and capital of enterprises, and  select a dozen large iron and steel enterprises to make  experiments in supervising their state-owned assets. After  that, he particularly stressed that we must learn from the  experience of such enterprises as Baoshan Iron and Steel Works  and Wuhan Iron and Steel Works, fully implement the reform of  internal enterprise structure, sever links with units and  personnel not related to iron and steel production, establish a  modernized enterprise management system, and deepen the reform  of the personnel, labor, and wage systems in enterprises....    The wishes to try as soon as possible to work according to  the experience of experimental units are understandable, but it  is incorrect if we fail to implement enterprise reform even when  we can do so.  <H3>  Inspiration From the Experience of Wuhan Iron and Steel  Works: Stepping on the Gangplank Before We Board a Ship </H3>   As far as the establishment of a modern enterprise system is  concerned, some cadres commended it but also commented: "Why  did we do it if we had known it beforehand?" The implication  was that: Every effort in enterprise reform in the last 15 years  was a sheer waste, just like lighting a candle for a blind  person!    Such an understanding is incorrect because the practice of  enterprise reform is a continuous process by stages. Over the  past 15 years, enterprise reform underwent different stages,  including the stage of delegating power to lower levels and  letting them retain a portion of profits, substituting two-step  taxation for the delivery of profits to the state, implementing  the contracted management responsibility system, and changing  the enterprise management system. Every step of reform not only  offered experience but also laid the foundation for the next  step of reform, and every new reform measure was proposed in  light of the focal points and difficulties in the previous stage  of reform. We can say that the basis for establishing a modern  enterprise system does not exist without the success of reform  in the last decade or so, and that we would not introduce the  concept of establishing a modern enterprise system without the  exploration of reform practice in the past.    In addition, some comrades said: Since the Central Party  Committee has set the establishment of a modern enterprise  system as the reform orientation of state-own enterprises, why  cannot we wait patiently for some time and achieve our goal in  one move by simply following the experience of experimental  units to be introduced?    Is such an idea correct? Let us look at the reform practice  of Wuhan Iron and Steel Works first.    On 7 January 1994, Liu Benren, president of Wuhan Iron and  Steel Works, addressed the national metallurgical work meeting  and briefed attendants on their decision to spend two years to  reform the enterprise management system: Originally, there were  more than 120,000 staff and workers in Wuhan Iron and Steel  Works but the annual output of iron and steel was only around 5  million metric tons and the per capita output was merely 40  metric tons, which was far lower than the advanced international  standard. The main reason was to plunge all its strength into  work irrespective of the size of production, thus leading to  great waste of labor force, equipment, and technological  resources. From August 1992 onwards, Wuhan Iron and Steel Works  drew on the experience of Baoshan Iron and Steel Works and  started reforming the management system with emphasis on  strengthening the main body and severing links with departments  not related to iron and steel production. Up to the end of last  year, more than 70,000 staff and workers left the iron and steel  profession and successively formed "four large corporations" and  "four small companies" to march to the domestic and  international markets. Last year, the output of Wuhan Iron and  Steel Works was 5.05 million metric tons, registering an  increase of 6.12 percent over that of the previous year.  However, the per capita output of iron and steel increased from  40 to 93.4 metric tons, sales earnings and profits and taxes  realized increased 30.67 percent and 34.45 percent compared with  that of the previous year, and export exchange earnings exceeded  $110 million, thus putting an end to the situation of stagnation  for years. Afterwards, this reporter asked President Liu Benren  about the relationship between reform of the enterprise  management system and the establishment of a modern enterprise  system. He presented a brilliant viewpoint after a little  thought:    "Clearly defined property rights, as well as the rights and  responsibilities of enterprises, separation of government  administration and enterprise management, and scientific  management are characteristics of a modern enterprise system.  If we say that the first three characteristics can only be  realized by relying on the coordination of government  departments, `scientific management' must be achieved in a  practical manner by relying on enterprises themselves. In  particular, under the situation which Hubei Province and the  Ministry of Metallurgy consent to the joint-stock transformation  of Wuhan Iron and Steel Works, we have decided to take the  initiative to reform the enterprise management system, and the  goal is precisely to come close to a modern enterprise system as  soon as possible."    Being positive and taking the initiative without relying on  others and without delay, proceeding from the real conditions of  one's own enterprise to select the breakthrough point for  deepening reform, and trying by every possible means to come  close to a modern enterprise system as soon as possible -- these  are precisely what are inspired by the experience of the Wuhan  Iron and Steel Works. If expressed in a more symbolic  description, we must "step on the gangplank before we board a  ship." Here, the "ship" refers to the modern enterprise system  and the "gangplank" refers to the five aspects clearly pointed  out by the Decision which we should accomplish.    It is a gradual process to establish a modern enterprise  system in China, during which we have to shoulder heavy  responsibilities and can never achieve our goal in one step. We  must, in the first place, work in a down-to-earth manner, be  persistent and dauntless, and march forward courageously. The  more down-to-earth and comprehensive we do our work at early  stages, the less time we spend in going through such a  historical course.</p>

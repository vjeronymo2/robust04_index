			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by political </F> correspondent Shlomo Ganor in the studio on 29 April --  recorded, in Hebrew with Arabic subtitles; processed from the  Hebrew]    [Text] [Ganor] Mr. Foreign Minister, you met with the  U.S. secretary of state today. What did Israel equip him with  in anticipation of his meetings in Damascus tomorrow?    [Peres] He was given significant equipment in terms of ideas  regarding the two issues on the agenda: the method of  negotiations and their content. It is clear to me that it is  impossible to reach agreement on the content before we determine  the manner in which the negotiations will be held. In other  words, no agreement can be reached without holding meetings at  the level of the decisionmaking leadership on one hand and  exchanging ideas at a discreet level on the other. In order to  conduct proper negotiations, we need a quiet place in which  ideas can be exchanged and a public place where the people can  see that both sides seriously intend to attain peace.    [Ganor] And so far, Syria has not understood this message?    [Peres] No. So far, Damascus has been stubborn in its own  way. We are not telling Damascus that it should align itself  with the Israeli way of negotiating. We are telling Syria that  Damascus, like Jerusalem, should conduct negotiations according  to acceptable international norms.    [Ganor] Is Israel insisting that the nature of peace be  defined before it determines the depth of withdrawal on the  Golan?    [Peres] It is very possible that negotiations on both these  issues should be held in parallel. If I tell you that one  should come before the other, then one party would ask why it  should be the first, and so on. We are saying to Damascus: At  this time, let us determine a method that will enable us to  discuss ideas and a method that will enable us to demonstrate to  the people that we are heading toward peace.    [Ganor] In the meantime, there is a feeling in the Golan  settlements that an Israeli-Syrian arrangement will begin with  Majdal Shams first.    [Peres] There is no basis to this story. We have entered no  territorial or detailed negotiations. At this stage, we are  negotiating only about the manner in which we should begin real  and serious negotiations.    [Ganor] Did the United States show understanding regarding  the package of guarantees Israel is seeking?    [Peres] There is no doubt the Americans showed an interest  in the package. I would not want to commit them to more than  that. I believe Mr. Christopher's jet was given enough fuel to  travel to Damascus.    [Ganor] What are the chances of resuming the Washington  negotiations now that the Palestinian issue has been settled, at  least in part?    [Peres] I believe there is more chance of this now because  Israel has once again proven that it is seriously and honestly  interested in reaching an understanding and an arrangement with  the Arabs. After all, no one pressured us in the negotiations  with the Palestinians; there were no thundering guns or pressure  from the superpowers. The decision to reach an arrangement came  from within. Incidentally, this is happening around the world.  South Africa solved its problems from the inside. Communism  was eliminated from within. There is no one out there to apply  pressure. Each nation should decide for itself where it wants  to go, the price it is willing to pay for this, and the stages  it wants to go through in order to solve its problems.    [Ganor] Mr. Peres, what reality will prevail in Gaza and in  Israel starting 4 May?    [Peres] It will be different from anything we have known  over the past 46 years. We left Gaza once, but we were replaced  by the Egyptians. This is the first time we will leave most of  the Gaza Strip and be replaced by Gaza residents exercising  self-rule, self-management, and their own responsibility. Look,  the Palestinian nation has never known the taste of being a  nation. It has never had a territorial address. This is the  first time the Palestinians will have a piece of reality with a  territorial address and the authority of an interim government,  of self-rule. This is a great thing for them.</p>

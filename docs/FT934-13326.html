			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Riot jail was 'at risk for months' THE DANGER of riot at Wymott Prison, the 1970s showpiece jail destroyed last month by inmates, had been widely known for months, Judge Stephen Tumim, chief inspector of prisons, said yesterday. In a damning report on the causes of the riot at the prison in Leyland, Lancashire, the judge said it was disturbing that the risk of riot had been signalled as far back as his own unannounced inspection of the prison 10 months earlier. In the days before the riot on September 6, the jail had been 'close to anarchy', he said. In the seven months before the riot, the incident log for B Wing included repeated reports of inmates being beaten up, false fire alarms, cells and windows smashed up and fires. His inspection had found a world of drugs and bullying with violent gangs terrifying inmates and turning parts of the prison into no-go areas for staff. The shortage of cells in the north-west had led to violent and volatile criminals being sent to Wymott even though it was 'no more than an open prison with a fence round it', Judge Tumim said. He called for standard cell doors so prisoners could be locked in; better trained night staff; improvements in staff/inmate relations; and more effective anti-drug measures. Welcoming the report Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, said there were 'important lessons to be learnt'.</p>

			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH COAST LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MISSION VIEJO USES PRESS TO DEFEAT DANA HILLS, 66-47  </P> <P> By switching defenses, Mission Viejo High rallied for a 66-47 victory over Dana  Hills in a South Coast League boys' basketball game Wednesday at Dana Hills  High School.  </P> <P> "We tried the half-court trap in the first quarter, but we couldn't score,"  Mission Viejo coach Bob Minier said.  </P> <P> "We changed our defense to a full-court press and our steals got Dana Hills out  of rhythm. They just didn't handle the pressure well."  </P> <P> Mission Viejo outscored Dana Hills, 29-10, in the second quarter. Against the  full-court press, Dana Hills could only make one of four field goals and eight  of nine free throws.  </P> <P> Dana Hills Coach Tom Riach said the game was "one of our worst efforts."  </P> <P> "We didn't handle their press well and we knew Mission Viejo would press,"  Riach said. "It was no surprise. After the first quarter we fell apart, got  lethargic and stood around and watched."  </P> <P> Mission Viejo boosted its record to 15-5 overall, 5-1 in the league and remains  in first place. Dana Hills fell to 14-7, 2-4.  </P> <P> Eric Cramer, with two three-point baskets, led Mission Viejo with 16 points.  J.B. Taylor led Dana Hills' effort with two three-point baskets and 13 points.

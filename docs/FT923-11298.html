			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Survey of Second Cars (2): A time to watch the pounds not the clock - Value for Money / Buying new on a limited budget may mean settling for old technology SELECTING a new company car is one of life's more pleasant tasks. A generous budget means you can pick and choose to your heart's content. Air conditioning, a CD player, leather trim - all appear within reach. But choosing a second car, from taxed income, is altogether different: the all-important factor is the price. Never mind how long it takes to accelerate from 0-60 mph; never mind that you have to wind up your own windows. When you're paying the bill, the bottom line is, well, the bottom line. If you need proof, just ask Volkswagen's marketing men. The company's entry level Polo Fox enjoyed all the benefits of being a member of the VW family, with reliability, quality, design integrity, style and panache all taken for granted. Dealers should have been turning buyers away. The fact that they weren't is partly due to the recession, but mainly down to the price tag, a hefty Pounds 6,661 - considerably more than the rivals. After discounting, of course, the prices moved far closer together, but the private buyer tended to forget that and did not consider the Polo in the first place. So, instead of having a car that cost a mint, VW cut dealer margins, lowering the price to just under Pounds 6,000. As the advertisements proclaim: 'For once, a Volkswagen falls below your expectations.' Whether or not the price cut has the desired effect remains to be seen, but there is little doubt that, at the cheaper end of the market, keen pricing is significantly more important than the ultimate in modern technology. Indeed, at under Pounds 7,000, a 'new' car's average age is around 10 years old. Some are older still: the newly introduced Pounds 5,895 Indian-built Hindustan Ambassador (which will shortly be available in the UK) is basically a 1950s Morris Oxford. It makes an elderly Lada or Yugo look positively youthful. And that's the problem when buying new on a limited budget: from a technological point of view, it's a case of 'all our yesterdays'. The two cheapest new cars on the market, the Yugo Tempo and Lada Riva, are designs that Fiat abandoned decades ago. So if all you want is a new K-plate to upstage the neighbours, then maybe less than Pounds 3,900 is not such a high price to pay. But if you're planning to drive the car, maybe you ought to budget a little more, for the Tempo and Riva are crude in the extreme. They offer a great deal of metal for the money but are heavy to drive and poorly made - and let's be honest, they weren't particularly good cars when they were new all those years ago. Stretching the budget to Pounds 5,000 brings a better news. There are still variations on the Riva and Tempo theme available, but from the viewpoint of living with the car it would be better to look elsewhere. Fiat's entry level model is the Pounds 4,500 Panda 750L. Boxy, but not without a certain style, the baby Panda has a delightful engine, reasonable comfortable and minimalist appeal. It's a far better car than the similar looking but cheaper Seat Marbella, which draws on older Panda underpinnings for its power and chassis. Alongside the Russian Riva, Lada sells the Samara (from Pounds 4,695), a front-wheel-drive hatchback that is as modern as the Riva is antiquated. The Samara is a good effort, but not as good as the Skoda Favorit (from Pounds 4,615). While the stand-up comics were having a go, Skoda, helped by new parent VW, quietly got on with the job in hand. The front-drive Favorit is smart, roomy and, whisper it, a good car. With Pounds 6,000 things get better still. The Kia Pride (from Pounds 5,575) may be warmed-up old technology - it's basically an old-style Mazda 121 built in Korea - but there was precious little wrong with the original. Also worth a look are Citroen's AX - the facelifted range starts, fittingly, with the Debut at Pounds 5,760 - and the VW Polo. Deals should be possible on both the Vauxhall Nova (from Pounds 5,650) and the Nissan Micra (Pounds 5,995), as both are due for replacement soon; but unless you are a real masochist, forget the three-wheeler Reliant Rialto estate, massaged back to life by Del Trotter from television's Only Fools and Horses. With a Pounds 7,000 budget, however, one genuinely new car comes into reach. The best in the sector is the Peugeot 106 (from Pounds 6,140), a good-looking and fun-to-drive supermini that has external dimensions almost identical to its big sister, the 205, but is roomier inside. Rivals include the Fiesta, a faithful Ford that does most things well but nothing brilliantly; the Fiat Uno, brimful of Italian brio; and the ancient Renault 5, still on sale despite the arrival of the Clio. Then there's the born-again Rover Metro. The baby Rover may look much the same as it always has, but with the award-winning K-series engine, a five-speed gearbox on most models and new build quality, the Metro is a strong challenger. Value for money is the key to the Proton Aeroback (from Pounds 6,799), the Hyundai X2 (Pounds 6,920) and Sao Penza (Pounds 6,633). Made in Malaysia, Korea and South Africa respectively, they use second-generation Japanese technology with their own interpretation of style - the exception being the Sao, which is a rebadged Mazda 323. Diesel fans can also buy new for under Pounds 7,000 - at Pounds 6,778, the Seat Ibiza, the Spanish version of the Fiat Strada, 1.7D is the UK's cheapest diesel. With Pounds 8,000 to spend, the selection includes: the new Renault Clio (from Pounds 7,350), a roomy, chic and modern hatchback; from Japan, the Daihatsu Charade, Suzuki Swift and Subaru Justy; from Italy, the odd Lancia Y10; and the base hatchbacks in the next size up (cars such as the Peugeot 309 and Rover Maestro). There is also the chance to go off at a tangent with an off-roader. The Spanish-built Suzuki Samurai is fun, if basic, but forget the Lada Niva and Rumanian-built Dacia Duster. And for under Pounds 8,000 you can also buy a slice of history - the Mini Cooper (Pounds 7,688) is back, now with fuel injection and a catalytic converter. It may not be as fast as its more modern rivals, but they can't turn a trip to the shops into the Monte Carlo Rally. Between Pounds 8,000 and Pounds 10,000 the choice is wide, but is evenly split between the top specification superminis and 'cooking' versions of family cars such as the Vauxhall Astra, Ford Escort, Fiat Tipo, Volkswagen Golf, Peugeot 405, Nissan Sunny, Mitsubishi Colt, Mazda 323, Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla (a new version is due soon) and VW-based Seat Toledo. Worth considering, however, are the acclaimed Citroen ZX (from Pounds 8,529), which is smart, comfortable and easy to drive (unlike many Citroens of the past), and the Hyundai Lantra, a conventional looking saloon that packs in a remarkable number of goodies considering its Pounds 9,998 price tag. It's the same story with the heavily advertised Ford Sierra Azura. At Pounds 9580, it is Pounds 1,000 cheaper than the previous entry level Sierra and is loaded with special equipment. Why so cheap? Simply that the 1.6-litre engine is not catalysed and the Sierra itself will be replaced early next year - it's an end-of-season sale bargain. But even with Pounds 10,000 to spend, you'll look in vain for CD players, air conditioning and all the other luxuries found in a typical company car, unless you consider personally importing one of the new breed of micro cars from Japan. But that, as they say, is another story. Free credit? It may be genuinely available, but it, too, is liable to have a price tag: see page 10</p>

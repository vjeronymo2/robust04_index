			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The commentators' arguments against the current proposal, however, appear to based on the assumption that requiring all CQS market markets to register and participate in ITS will increase the extent of internalization in Rule 19c&hyph;3 securities. In its study of the U.S. equity market, the Division of Market Regulation (``Division'') considered concerns regarding internalization of transactions in Rule 19c&hyph;3 securities. <FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>  After examining data on off-board trading for 100 most active NYSE issues during 1992, <FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>  the division determined that the extent of internalization of transactions in Rule 19c&hyph;3 securities was not significant. <FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>  In addition, in their letters in response to the Division's study, <FOOTCITE>27</FOOTCITE>  the Amex and the regional exchanges urged that all third market makers be required to become part of the ITS/CAES linkage and subjected to the ITS trade through rules. <FOOTCITE>28</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 24 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Division of Market Regulation, Securities and Exchange Commission,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Market 2000, An Examination of Current Equity Market Developments, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  (January 1994), (`` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Market 2000 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ''), Study III at 8&hyph;10. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 25 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Of these stocks, 20 stocks were Rule 19c&hyph;3 stocks that are not subject to off-board trading restrictions and 80 were covered by off-board trading restrictions, NYSE Rule 390. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 26 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Division's analysis revealed that the exchange markets have remained the primary marketplace for securities that are not subject to off-board trading restrictions. In addition, the mean proportion of reported share volume executed OTC for the 20 Rule 19c&hyph;3 stocks was 8% versus 5.2% for the 80 stocks subject to off-board trading restrictions. Even if the 2.8% difference between the figures is wholly attributable to internalization by NYSE firms, it is not a large figure. It is less than the volume in these stocks sent by NYSE members to affiliated specialists at regional exchanges.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Market 2000 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , Study III at 10. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 27 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Division requested comments regarding its equity market study in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30920 (July 14, 1992), 57 FR 32587. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 28 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See letters to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, Commission, from James R. Jones, Chairman, Amex, (December 8, 1992); and from William G. Morton, Jr., BSE, John L. Fletcher, CHX, Leopold Korins, PSE, and Nicholas A. Giordano, PHLX, (December 11, 1992). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission believes that the ITS trade-through policy should apply to all third market trading. See Market 2000 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , Study III, at 13, 14. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NASD's proposal will increase the interaction and exposure of third market making activity to other markets by requiring all registered CQS market makers to participate in ITS/CAES. Thus, the proposal will increase the universe of third market trading subject to the ITS price protection rules. On balance, the proposal will benefit the market, advance the development of an NMS, and meet statutory goals. Thus, the Commission believes that the NASD's proposal represents a significant step in the interaction and exposure of securities in the NMS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NYSE also commented that transaction reporting by third market makers is not comparable to transaction reporting by exchanges. Because the NASD's rules require the price reported by third market makers be ``reasonably related to the prevailing market,'' the NYSE believes that third market makers may report a transaction price different from the execution price confirmed to customers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1980, the NASD amended its rules to require third market makers to report transactions on a ``gross'' basis, excluding any mark-up, mark-down, or service charge. <FOOTCITE>29</FOOTCITE>  The NASD's reporting requirements effectively eliminated any disparity in transaction reporting between the exchange and the third market. <FOOTCITE>30</FOOTCITE>  These rules are still in effect. In addition, Rule 10b&hyph;10 under the Act requires broker-dealers to report on confirmations the trade price and mark-up in principal transactions. Because Rule 10b&hyph;10 requires that the trade price broker-dealers disclose on a customer confirmation be the same as that disseminated for transaction reporting, the rule prevents broker-dealers from reporting a transaction price different from that confirmed to customers. <FOOTCITE>31</FOOTCITE>  The Commission continues to believe that transaction reporting by the third market is sufficiently comparable to transaction reporting by the exchange market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 29 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Securities Exchange Act Release No. 16960 (July 7, 1980), 45 FR 47291. To ensure adherence to the rule, the NASD also requires the price reported to be reasonably related to the prevailing market. Generally, the mark-up is the difference between the price the customer paid for the stock and the prevailing market price. Thus, the price third market makers report to the consolidated tape should, at all times, be the ``gross'' price excluding any dealer mark-up or mark-down. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 30 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In 1981, the PSE raised concerns regarding third market transaction reporting, similar to those of the NYSE, to oppose the implementation of the ITS/CAES interface. Because the NASD requires transaction reporting on a gross basis, the Commission stated that the PSE's concerns were not warranted.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt </F> by Thomas Michelsen; place and date not given]    [Text] As members of the European Union [EU] we will have  a security bonus, Prime Minister Carl Bildt declared. If in the  future someone threatens northern Europe it will be a threat not  only to northern Europe, but also to the whole system of  European cooperation.    ``It is true that I do not believe that red-brown revanchism  will win power in Russia. But if this were to happen,  membership in the EU gives increased security. When Finland,  Sweden, Norway, and Denmark participate in the EU's common  foreign and security policy there will be a clearer linkage  between European and northern European stability.    ``This is of significance for the three Baltic states. And  for relations between West Europe and Russia, which only meet up  here in the north,'' the prime minister said.    [Michelsen] But could Sweden not come to be seen as an  outpost of one of the great powers -- precisely that which our  old policy of neutrality wanted to avoid? An outpost that the  other great power (read: the former Soviet Union) would attack  immediately when it came to the crunch?    "They could suspect that we were part of the other side --  something that we were to a large extent, it has emerged," Carl  Bildt said. "What has surprised me most in what has now emerged  is the construction of bases. That we built air bases to  receive large bombers returning after attacks on the Soviet  Union. They were not based in Sweden, thank God. Instead they  were to carry out their attacks on the Soviet Union from bases a  long way away, and for them to be able then to get out of the  unpleasantness Sweden had landing places ready. It is obvious  that this was known in the Soviet Union. It is not particularly  difficult to measure the length of the runways at airports.    ``Now the situation is very different,'' Bildt said. ``Now  we are entering into open cooperation with the other European  democracies with the aim of achieving security and stability in  Europe as a whole.    ``This cannot be compared with the policy in the fifties and  sixties when we played a role in the nuclear strategy of the  Western side. A role that was brought to the knowledge of the  government of the country and no one else. But known in the  Soviet Union.    ``Then, in the fifties and sixties, we had a confrontation  between superpowers. Two systems stood armed against each  other. The whole time there was a risk of nuclear war. This is  something we no longer have. And the nuclear arms are becoming  outdated. The nuclear balance means less and less and the bloc  system is being broken up. Instead systems of cooperation are  on their way. But dangers and instability could also arise in  this new situation. And then the security and cooperation  systems will mean a great deal.''    [Michelsen] What has the government achieved in respect of  the submarine question?    "We do not know much more about why violations occur. But we  have theories that are better founded," Carl Bildt said. ``And  Russian experts have attested that there are minisubmarines in  our archipelagoes. But every `indication' is not a submarine.  We had submarines here last summer, if on a somewhat limited  scale. We have also seen a change in how they behave. And  there have been certain indications this year too, even though  they have not been fully analyzed yet.    ``This is a very big security problem. We have moved  forward in our contacts with the Russians. But we have not  reached our goal,'' Bildt said.    And he believes that it will be a long time before the  submarine question is answered.    So what chance does Carl Bildt think he has of remaining in  office after the election? He has just lost a minister in his  government and opinion poll figures have long been pretty awful  for the government.    But Bildt demonstrated a steely optimism. Most things are  splendid.    "It is really quite remarkable. We have done everything we  said we would do. I have just dug out and reread the government  declaration from October 1991. There is only one thing we have  not managed to do. That was to make it possible to dentists to  set up their own practices -- something that New Democracy  blocked," Bildt said. "The Oresund bridge was the last big  thing that still remained. We have cleared that hurdle now."    [Michelsen] But despite this the opinion poll figures are so  bad.    "What is needed is a solid election campaign. Then the  opposition will also find itself with its back against the wall  with its alternatives being scrutinized. And then people will  see that the only thing that is certain about the Social  Democrats is that they will raise taxes significantly."    [Michelsen] But has not the government pushed this message  quite a lot of times?    "But it has not hit home. It drowns in other issues," Carl  Bildt said. "And do not forget that a third of voters make up  their minds during the election campaign itself. An election is  always a very open affair, regardless of the opinion poll  figures."    [Michelsen] But are not the Social Democrats usually good at  election campaigns?    "No, that is partly a myth. It is true that the Social  Democrats still have a powerful machine. But now people are no  longer as tied to authority and they do not accept diktats from  the trade unions in the same way," Carl Bildt said. ``As a  result the Social Democrats' relative upper hand in election  campaigns has almost disappeared.    ``They could find themselves in the psychologically  difficult  situation of having to fight an election campaign with opinion  poll figures that are falling.''    Carl Bildt said that he is convinced that in four months'  time he will still be leading a government consisting of the  same four nonsocialist parties.    "And I see no reason to change the government team. But this  is up to the various parties. The choice of team players is not  up to me."</p>

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Shirescot Shires High-Yielding Smaller Companies Trust is to more than double in size through a placing and offer for subscription of conversion shares to raise up to Pounds 24m, net of expenses. Shirescot, launched in the summer of 1992, is managed by Glasgow Investment Managers; it currently has a market capitalisation of just over Pounds 21m. Williams de Broe has conditionally agreed to place 10.18m of the C shares at 100p apiece. A further 14.8m C shares are available under the subscription offer, which is not underwritten. The shares will be converted into ordinary shares by October 14, when one new warrant to subscribe will be issued for every five new ordinary shares arising on conversion.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic developments monitored through 5 May.    Jose Roberto Orellana Milla, president of the Salvadoran  Central Reserve Bank, has described as positive the results of  the privatization program of the country's banks and financial  institutions. Regarding the sale of shares of the Atlacatl  financial institution, he has said 25 percent of the shares were  made available to small investors, 25 percent to Atlacatl  employees, and the remaining 50 percent to investors who would  like to obtain more than 100,000 colons. Orellana has announced  that thus far five banks and four financial institutions have  been privatized. (San Salvador Radio Cadena YSU in Spanish 1800  GMT 26 Apr 94)    Central Reserve Bank stabilization certificates totaling  93,715,226.72 colons were negotiated during the early morning  stock market sessions. Stabilization bonds of the Bank of  Guatemala and Emergency Coffee fund were also negotiated.  Yesterday's total negotiations amounting to 109,613,305 colones  showed an upward trend, compared with last month's operations,  which did not go over the 8-million colons mark. (San Salvador  LA PRENSA GRAFICA in Spanish 26 Apr p 14)    The Salvadoran Central Reserve Bank has confirmed that in  1993 imports totaled $1.9 billion, an 11.9-percent increase over  1992. Bank sources have said the increase was a result of the  stabilized rate of exchange, the commercial opening, and  facilities offered to industries. Exports showed a 21-percent  increase compared to 1992. (San Salvador Radio Cadena YSU in  Spanish 1800 GMT 28 April 94)</p>

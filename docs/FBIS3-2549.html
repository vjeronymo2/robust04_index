On the afternoon of 2 March, the commission on politics and  law under the provincial party committee and the provincial  committee for overall improvement of social order held a  telephone conference to mobilize all people of the province to  engage in the battle of improving social order in spring. The  conference urged that the leading comrades of the departments  concerned at various levels and the broad masses of security  cadres and policemen should have a sense of high responsibility  to the party and the people, consciously and positively engage  in the battle of improving social order in spring, bring the  battle of improving social order into line with the major work  agenda of the provincial party committee and the provincial  government, and regard the battle as a great matter and attend  to it. The party and government principal leaders should  personnally assume leadership over the work and personally solve  major problems cropping up in the course of launching the  battle. All departments concerned should work closely in  cooperation with one another, build up a powerful momentum to  meet for the battle, and organize capable work teams to  coordinately meet for the battle. We should concentrate human,  material, and financial resources so as to provide reliable  material guarantees for meeting for the battle.    The conference urged: To win a success in the battle, the  political and legal departments and the public security  departments should bring into play their role as the main force,  fully exercise their functions, resolutely implement the  principle of sternly and rapidly punishing criminals according  to laws, strengthen the extent of attacks, and strengthen  various measures for management of social order according to  laws. The political and legal departments and the public  security departments should work closely in cooperation with one  another, strengthen unity, and enhance the overall functions for  meeting for the battle. All departments concerned should  positively join the battle of improving social order, get rid of  the wrong idea of having nothing to do with themselves, take on  the duty that they should do, and ensure the smooth and  effective progress of the battle. In launching the battle, we  should put attacks in a prominent position.    The conference stressed: We should sternly deal blows to  serious criminal activities with the focus on cracking major  cases, eliminating gangs of criminals, and pursuing escaped  criminals; regard it as the primary important task of battle;  and firmly attend to it. We should intensify the investigation  work, concentrate efforts to tackle difficult problems, and  strive to crack a number of major and appalling cases. Leaders  should personally engage in the cracking of major cases on a  contracted responsibility system. Handsome awards should be  given to the personnel with contributions to cracking major  cases. Those who create serious consequences to the neglect of  duties should be investigated and called into account. The rest  follow-up links relating to the attacks against criminals should  immediately and lawfully handle the cases, that have been  investigated.    The conference pointed out: This battle should be focused on  putting attacks in a prominent position. Simultaneously,  educational, defense, management, building-up, and reformatory  links should appropriately catch up with the progress of the  battle; cooperatively work for and ensure the progress of the  battle; and consolidate the achievements in the battle. We  should study ways and work out necessary measures for solving  key problems, make the measures for overall improvement of  social order coordinate with one another, actually bring into  play the functions of the departments for overall improvement of  social order, and make real achievements in the battle.</p>

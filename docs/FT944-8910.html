			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / International Company News: Yamaha Motor accelerates Yamaha Motor said aggressive cost-cutting was behind a 94 per cent jump in recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax - for the first six months to September, Reuter reports from Tokyo. Yamaha, the world's second largest motorcycle maker, said parent recurring profits soared to Y3.01bn (Dollars 30.6m) from Y1.55bn a year earlier, even though sales were flat at Y223.09bn, compared with Y223.65bn a year ago. Cost-cutting measures, such as using more interchangeable parts, saved the company Y5.8bn in the first half, said Mr Takehiko Hasegawa, Yamaha Motor president. Strong exports of components to China and other Asian nations also helped, he said. The company forecast parent recurring profits of Y4bn for the full year to March 31, up 9.4 per cent from a year ago. It would be Yamaha's first rise in annual profit in four years. But Mr Hasegawa said the company believed there was only limited room to boost profits further, due to the yen's strength against the dollar and an uncertain outlook for the Japanese and overseas economies. 'We were able to increase our sales prices in the first half, but it will be hard to do this in the second half because of the strong yen,' he said. Because of the yen's strength the company has lowered its forecast of motorcycle exports to 330,000 units in the year to next March from a May forecast of 375,000. Exports totalled 388,000 units last year.</p>

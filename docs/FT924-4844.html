			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Standard Chartered to dispose of joint venture STANDARD Chartered yesterday announced the proposed sale of its 50 per cent stake in Chartered WestLB, the London-based international merchant bank jointly owned by Standard Chartered and two German banks. The stake was sold to WestLB (Europe) UK Holdings, which is 75 per cent owned by Westdeutsche Landesbank and 25 per cent owned by Sudwestdeustsche Landesbank. Standard Chartered will be paid Pounds 26.3m plus a dividend of half the earnings of Chartered WestLB for 1992, and a share of dividends for three years after that. The move - if approved by the Bank of England - will complete the disposal of what was Standard Chartered's London-based merchant bank. It will be left with merchant banking arms in Singapore, Hong Kong and Zimbabwe. Mr Rodney Galpin, chief executive, said the transaction reflected a re-refocussing of Standard Chartered businesses to concentrate capital on core activities. It did not affect the commercial banking relationship with WestLB</p>

			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / World Trade News: 'Neighbour' nations defy South Africa THIS week's announcement from the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC) that it plans to turn itself into the more ambitious Southern African Development Community (SADC) is a sign it had failed to deliver the goods. While few dispute the need for a change, it is unclear that this initiative, which aims to replace a loose arrangement of sectoral co-operation between nine nations with a formal treaty seeking greater economic integration, is for the better. With the premise of SADC seeming to provide a bulwark against South Africa's economic dominance in the region, it seems set to fail. As Johannesburg's Business Day argues, it seems an 'exercise in futility' to try to deny economic links with South Africa just when most foreign interest in the region wants to use it as a springboard, not a main player. SADCC's change was forced on it by the South Africa reform process undermining a basic tenet of its existence: the need to achieve economic independence from a hostile neighbour (South Africa itself). Formed in 1980 with nine member states (Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe), since joined by post-independence Namibia, SADCC sought to reduce external economic dependence, especially on South Africa, and promote economic development. This week's changeover to the new SADC raises questions on two fronts: the relationship between SADC and South Africa; and the need for greater economic integration. South Africa elicits contradictory reactions among SADC members. It can be seen as the saviour - the region's economic locomotive and, with foreign aid flows not as free as in the past, a potential paymaster - or feared, as an economy able to swamp its neighbours. The dilemma is real, but this week's decision suggests SADC prefers to delay confronting it. Sound political reasons exist for not having any truck with South Africa until it has achieved full democracy, but it seems clear the only hope for achieving a useful regional economic grouping is with South Africa at its core. Re-organising before addressing the South Africa issue seems futile. Setting aside South Africa, analysts are sceptical about the route of deeper economic integration chosen by SADC. Dr Eric Leistner of the Africa Institute notes: 'The aims of SADC are more ambitious, so they will fail more spectacularly (than SADCC).' Three major problems are involved in this route: the first concerns the Preferential Trade Agreement (PTA). Eight of SADC's members belong to the PTA, and SADC overlaps considerably with the PTA, yet SADC will not merge with PTA - an illogical stance. Second, PTA has had limited success in its aims, such as tariff reduction, due to lack of economic resources and political will on the part of its members. Why should things be different for SADC? Also, the limited success enjoyed in achieving the far less demanding aims of SADCC casts serious doubt on whether SADC can hope to progress in the difficult task of economic integration. Finally, the enormous economic disparities between the member countries of SADC, in terms of such factors as inflation and access to foreign currency, make integration problematical. Given these problems, and an unwillingness to cede sovereignty to regional bodies, a more promising route would for the SADC countries to focus on aims such as co-operation in sectors such as energy, transport and movement of goods.</p>

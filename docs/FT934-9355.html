			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / LDP calls for Ozawa evidence on donations JAPAN'S opposition Liberal Democratic party yesterday demanded that its former powerbroker, Mr Ichiro Ozawa, now a senior member of the governing coalition, testify in parliament about donations received from a construction company. Mr Ozawa has admitted receiving Y5m (Pounds 31,250) late last year, when he was still an LDP member, but insists the donation was legal, and claims the LDP is attempting to use the issue to derail the coalition's political reform programme. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has promised to change the political system by the end of the year, and needs to secure quick agreement on four reform bills. However the LDP has listed 21 objections to the proposals and delayed negotiations with the government. Disagreement over the reform bills has yet to dent Mr Hosokawa's personal popularity, according to a poll published by the Asahi Shimbun newspaper yesterday. After three months in office, his cabinet has an approval rating of 70 per cent, (71 per cent last month), but still higher than any other cabinet since 1946. Apart from convincing the LDP to discuss reform and dealing with the Ozawa controversy, Mr Hosokawa faces difficulty in convincing the Social Democratic party, the largest group in the coalition, to accept even minor changes to the reform bills. The SDP, formerly the Japan Socialist party, yesterday would not accept any alteration to a proposal for 250 MPs to be chosen from single-seat constituencies and through proportional representation, making a total of 500 members for the House of Representatives, the more powerful of Japan's two houses. But the LDP wants 171 seats chosen through proportional representation and 300 from single-seats, which will replace the present multi-seat constituency system. Komeito (the Clean Government party), a coalition member, has suggested 275 single-seats, but the SDP said it would quit the coalition if the original proposal is changed. SDP members, some of whom fear changes to the political system may end their parliamentary careers indicated yesterday that they want Mr Ozawa questioned in parliament about the background to the construction company's Y5m donation.</p>

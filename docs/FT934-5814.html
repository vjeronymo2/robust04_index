			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Books: Saviour of Spain - or brutal fascist? - The first comprehensive biography of Franco FRANCO: A BIOGRAPHY by Paul Preston Collins Pounds 25, 1002 pages Through a mixture of luck and cautious cunning, Francisco Franco Bahmonde emerged in 1939 from the Spanish civil war at the head of a victorious army and became Caudillo of Spain. The next 35 years, during which he ruled Spain, have come to be seen through the prism of ideological opposites. Francoists claimed he saved the country from anarchy and communism, and then went on to lay the framework for a prosperous modern state with a stable succession. Franco's enemies never forgave his civil war victory over the Republicans. To them he was a brutal military dictator who kept Spain isolated from the mainstream of modern Europe, retarding economic and social development by several decades. At his death in 1975 he was still type-cast as a fascist ruler. However, Franco died in his bed at the ripe old age of 82 while still head of state, implying he enjoyed a degree of acceptance which his detractors were never willing to concede. Franco also solved the problem of succession by restoring the monarchy, something which today might allow the regime to be seen in a more benevolent light. This is not the case with Paul Preston, an expert on contemporary Spain and professor of international history at the London School of Economics. In the first comprehensive biography on Franco, Preston says he will be remembered above all for 'his ruthless conduct of the Nationalist war effort between 1936 and 1939 and the determination with which he pursued the systematic annihilation of his enemies on the left'. At a secondary level he will be remembered 'for the sheer duration of his survival'. Franco's achievements, he says, were personal and sectarian. He never made any attempt to heal the appalling scars left by the civil war. His Pharaonic monument to the dead, the Valley of the Fallen near Madrid, where he himself is buried, merely emphasised Franco's vindictive sense of triumph over his enemies. Thus he was no more than 'a skilful manipulator of power who always looked to his own personal interests'. At over 1,000 pages, including footnotes and bibliography, this is a painstaking reconstruction from every available source. Unfortunately, Preston's manifest absence of sympathy for Franco colours the tone of his judgment - even if the general thrust of the judgments themselves are likely to stand the test of time. Preston takes the conventional view of Franco's military skill, arguing he was a safe but unimaginative commander. He faults Franco's excessive caution for prolonging the civil war. But this overlooks Franco's belief that, in a fratricidal conflict, a clear victory was essential to ensure subsequent stability. The biography is at its most convincing dealing with the tense period in 1940 when Franco was tempted to join the Axis powers. Franco cultivated the idea that he had saved Spain from involvement in the second world war. The reality was more prosaic. Franco admired Hitler and believed he would win. By backing Hitler, he anticipated the victor's spoils of Gibraltar and French North African possessions. However, Hitler had serious doubts about the value of Spanish entry into the war, and this gave time for Franco to reconsider. By then the tide had begun to turn and the Allies were offering economic aid; so Spain remained neutral. In his negative assessment of Franco, Preston should have considered whether in fact Spain needed a period of repressed stability, like that provided by the Caudillo, to recover from the ravages of civil war and its long history of political instability. The civil war had in part been provoked by the advent of the republic in the 1930s and the introduction at a forced pace of a secular democratic state when there had been no such previous tradition. Linked to this is the issue whether Franco, having come to power by accident rather than design, should have stepped aside. And if so, how and when? The earliest feasible moment would have been in 1946. Then concerted Allied pressure might have forced him to step down in favour of Don Juan as part of an internationally-negotiated settlement that included Spain in the Marshall Plan. But Franco had by then acquired a taste for power and the monarchist solution was fraught with danger. The monarchy was not particularly popular, the previous monarch, Alfonso X111 having done little to distinguish himself off the hunting field and out of the bedroom. Don Juan himself was a weak figure with little appeal to the Republicans other than as a means of ousting Franco and his fascist supporters in the Falange movement. At this stage the army, the pillar of Franco's power, was dead against any reconciliation with the Republicans and there was still a guerilla problem inside Spain. Thus Franco stayed on, a prisoner of his and the regime's fear of instability. But Franco always had the monarchist solution in mind and astutely coopted the monarchy by persuading Don Juan to educate his son, the future King Juan Carlos, in Spain. Franco's fierce anti-communism meant that he could count on US and Vatican protection at the onset of the Cold War. Despite public anti-Franco posturing, no western government seriously challenged the status quo in Spain. In fact, the stability of the Franco regime (and that of his fellow dictator Salazar in Portugal) removed one post-war security problem for Nato. Meanwhile, Franco was flexible enough to tolerate a degree of internal opposition and was willing to listen to technocrats who persuaded him in 1956-57 to drop the economic policy of autarchy and begin to liberalise. His enemies crushed, and only mildly molested by hostility, much of Franco's rule was surprisingly easy. As the years went on, he spent more and more time shooting and fishing, less and less dealing with the cabinet. Fortunately, he could depend upon the loyal services of Admiral Luis Carrero Blanco, who ran government business and shielded his senility. Franco is supposed to have had two in-trays on his desk - one labelled 'problems solved in time' and the other 'problems solved by time'. He just shuffled paper from one to the other. Franco emerges from this biography a dull, rather mediocre figure - the proverbial sphynx without a secret. Yet Preston has avoided psychological analysis, leaving plenty of room for others to investigate the formative influences on Franco - such as his small stature, his pious mother and dissolute father, the near-fatal wound sustained as a young officer in Morocco, his bossy and socially pretentious wife, Dona Carmen. This might show Franco was not quite as dull as Preston makes him out.</p>

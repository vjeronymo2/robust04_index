			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Oil talks aim to stop price slide OIL MINISTERS from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries yesterday continued talks in Geneva aimed at setting future production levels which they hope will halt the slide in oil prices. Dr Subroto, the Indonesian secretary general of Opec, denied that specific output figures had been discussed by the 13 oil ministers, who began their official deliberations on Saturday. But he hoped a 'firm consensus on where the ceiling should be' would emerge during a second round of meetings between a sub-committee of 'three wise men' and the various delegations which began yesterday. A meeting of all 13 ministers is scheduled to be held today. A production ceiling of 23.5m barrels a day was agreed in June, but cheating by some producers resulted in third-quarter output at least 1m b/d higher. Opec overproduction and the prospect of rising output from other sources, including the North Sea, has caused the Opec basket price - the average of prices from seven Opec countries - to fall to just over Dollars 15 from Dollars 18 in April. In his opening speech on Saturday, Mr Jean Ping, the Gabon oil minister and current president of Opec, issued a blunt warning of the dangers of failing to agree on a 'credible' fourth-quarter output ceiling and an allocation of it that satisfied members, all of which are keen to increase revenues. 'The current state of the market gives us no room to manoeuvre,' he said. 'We cannot sustain another oil collapse such as the one in 1986.'</p>

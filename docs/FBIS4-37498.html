			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi has denied  that he is not a representative of the PLO or of its  institutions. Al-Tibi told Qol Yisra'el that his activity was  part of a mission to bring the Palestinian and Israeli peoples  closer together. I have done so in the past, and will continue  to do so in the future, he said.</p>

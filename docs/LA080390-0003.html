			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KEEPING KOSHER;  </P> <P> RULES GET TOUGHER AFTER MAJOR STORE LOSES ITS CERTIFICATE  </P> <P> Rabbi Leo Erlich, a kosher meat inspector, doesn't often climb into trash  dumpsters. But when he does, he can find the strangest things, like boxes from  non-kosher meat companies.  </P> <P> According to his account, that's what happened two months ago when he followed  up a tip about fraudulent meat sales at Emes Kosher Meat Products on La Cienega  Boulevard, the biggest kosher retailer in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The discovery led to the cancellation of Emes' kosher certificate and the  closing of the store, whose name means truth in Hebrew. Orthodox rabbis say  that plans were already in the works to raise standards of kosher enforcement  before the Emes case attracted headlines, but that the effort gained momentum  as a result of the publicity.  </P> <P> Last week, the 47-member Rabbinical Council of California, the largest kosher  inspection agency in the state, adopted a set of toughened rules governing the  eligibility of butchers for kosher certification and providing for expanded  inspections.  </P> <P> "I think the (Emes) scandal took us a long way. It was really an important  stimulus," said council member Abner Weiss, chief rabbi of Congregation Beth  Jacob in Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> "I'm still sick from that Emes business," said Erlich, 66, a short, wiry man  who wears a straw hat as he makes his rounds of 15 kosher butcher shops on the  Westside and in the San Fernando Valley on behalf of the Rabbinical Council.  </P> <P> "People tell me, 'You're a hero. You caught him,' " said Erlich, speaking in a  sharp Polish accent. "I say, 'I'm no hero.' It's a bad feeling when a Jewish  person does it to other Jewish people."  </P> <P> Semion Rachshtut, owner of the now-defunct Emes, has denied any wrongdoing, and  there are no state charges pending against him or any other kosher butcher.  </P> <P> The untrained eye may find it hard to tell the difference between kosher and  tref, or non-kosher -- the real thing tastes saltier and looks duller -- but  the difference is obvious in the price.  </P> <P> The intricate routine of ritual slaughter, draining, salting and deveining can  add a dollar or two a pound to the cost of meat or poultry, and the opportunity  is there for the unscrupulous to make a quick buck.  </P> <P> Erlich, who was trained at a yeshiva, or seminary, in Sosnowicz, Poland, said  he tries to look in on each of his 15 shops at least once a day, but at  variable hours.  </P> <P> Despite the occasional disappointment of finding a dishonest merchant, Erlich,  the Rabbinical Council's No. 1 inspector for butcher shops, said he gets a  certain satisfaction from his job.  </P> <P> No one is sure exactly how many of Los Angeles County's 600,000 Jews observe  traditional dietary laws. But a survey released by the Jewish Federation  Council of Greater Los Angeles said that 5% identify themselves as Orthodox,  while 33% said they belong to the middle-of-the-road Conservative wing of  Judaism. Both groups advocate adherence to the dietary laws.  </P> <P> During a recent visit to Rahamim's Kosher Meats on Pico Boulevard, Erlich  walked carefully across the brick floor, slippery with water and blood, and  stepped into the walk-in freezer, where he shrugged into the green sport coat  he carries folded over his arm.  </P> <P> Inside, he pointed to a quarter of beef hanging from a hook -- "Look here. It  has a kosher seal on all four corners" -- and poked at a pile of chickens in a  wooden box to make sure the ones on the bottom did not come from a non-kosher  source such as a supermarket.  </P> <P> "Business is very, very good, especially since they closed Emes," said owner  Yoram Cohen. "I've got three or four times the business I had before."  </P> <P> At Century City Meats, another shop nearby, Erlich watched as butcher Ezra  Gamzu wielded a curved blade to trim the fat that hides three forbidden veins  that must be removed before meat can be sold as kosher. The meat must also be  soaked in water for an hour and a half, covered with salt for an hour and  rinsed three times to remove as much blood as possible.  </P> <P> A small number of butcher shops and bakeries and about 40 kosher restaurants in  Los Angeles County get their certification from smaller, independent rabbinical  groups rather than from the Rabbinical Council.  </P> <P> Other eyes are watching, too, and not necessarily Jewish ones. Under a state  law enacted in 1985, county inspectors routinely check delivery invoices at  kosher butcher shops to make sure shoppers get what they pay for.  </P> <P> The sale of anything else would amount to false advertising, said Paul Branum,  an official of the state Department of Food and Agriculture, which administers  the $70,000 kosher inspection program in Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, Santa  Clara, San Francisco and Alameda counties.  </P> <P> Unlike the Rabbinical Council and its competitors, government inspectors are  not concerned with the rituals and ancient rabbinical rulings that govern the  preparation of kosher food. Instead, they check the records that butchers keep  to prove they bought their merchandise from kosher producers or packing houses.  </P> <P> Those who cannot account for their merchandise may be fined or closed, said  senior Assistant Atty. Gen. Herschel Elkins, who works with Nahan Gluck, head  of the county Department of Weights and Measures, to enforce the law in Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> Erlich credits a county inspector with tipping him to possible violations at  Emes, whose wide variety and low prices attracted customers from as far away as  Texas.  </P> <P> Despite the work of kosher inspectors, Jews who care about their religion's  dietary laws still have to trust their butcher, said Rabbi Joshua Berkowitz,  newly named chairman of the kashrut (the noun form of kosher) committee of the  Rabbinical Council of California.  </P> <P> Scheduled to go into effect over the coming year, the new rules will require  shop owners to be strict observers of the Sabbath. Those who are not observant  Jews will be required to have a full-time inspector on their staff in order to  keep their kosher certificate.  </P> <P> Out-of-state wholesalers whose kosher standards are questionable will be  banned, said Berkowitz, associate rabbi at Beth Jacob in Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> "L.A. was somewhat behind other communities, and I think it has come finally to  the recognition that L.A. is the second-largest (Jewish) community in the U.S.,  and we don't have to act . . . like a backwater," Berkowitz said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITY BASKETBALL PREVIEW;  </P> <P> L.A. POWERS CRENSHAW, MANUAL ARTS AGAIN HAVE STATE INTENTIONS  </P> <P> Since March, when Manual Arts, the City's top-ranked and last surviving  postseason basketball team, was ousted from the state playoffs, anticipation  started to build for this season.  </P> <P> With several City programs on the rise, at least four teams are considered  among the state's best. City teams have won five of the nine modern State  Division I titles: Crenshaw four of them and Manual Arts one.  </P> <P> Last season, Manual Arts won its first City 4-A title since 1981 by defeating  Crenshaw, 84-72. But in the state playoffs, City teams were slighted. Manual  Arts was seeded only third and Crenshaw and Fremont, which was runner-up in the  3-A Division with a 29-3 record, were passed over.  </P> <P> This season, quality teams and players can be found throughout the City  Section.  </P> <P> A look at The Times' preseason top 10 City Section basketball teams:  </P> <P> 1. MANUAL ARTS  </P> <P> Western League (4-A Division)  </P> <P> Last Season: 27-4  </P> <P> Third-year Coach Randolph Simpson has a solid team that is expected to repeat  as City 4-A champion. Marcell Capers and All-City center William Celestine are  gone, but the Toilers are still loaded with high-flying Kevin Beal, a 6-foot-5  forward, and Dwain Bradberry, a returning starter at guard.  </P> <P> Manual Arts will start three forwards and two guards because it does not have a  true center. The Toilers' strength will be balance: every Manual Arts starter  is taller than 6-3. Roland Merriwether (6-3), Bryan Smith (6-4) and Wilbert  Knight (6-3) are the other starters.  </P> <P> "We don't have the real big man," Simpson said. "But, we have guys who all can  handle the ball well, shoot well, and everyone plays above the rim."  </P> <P> 2. CRENSHAW  </P> <P> Southern League (4-A Division)  </P> <P> Last Season: 22-5  </P> <P> Last season was supposed to be an off year for the Cougars, but Coach Willie  West simply led Crenshaw to the 4-A final and finished with a 22-5 record. The  Cougars have the two players who led them last season -- guards Kevin Ollie and  Alexious Scruggs.  </P> <P> Ollie, a 6-2 senior, led Crenshaw in scoring last season and is joined in the  backcourt by Scruggs, a 6-2 junior, who loves to shoot. Last season, Crenshaw  did not have its usual depth but look for it this season as West goes for his  12th City title.  </P> <P> 3. FREMONT  </P> <P> Central League (3-A Division)  </P> <P> Last Season: 28-3  </P> <P> There are many who think that Coach Sam Sullivan has the best team in the City,  despite being in the 3-A Division, and they may be right. Last season, the  Pathfinders blasted into the 3-A final with a chance to win 30 games but were  upset by North Hollywood. This season, Fremont may be even better.  </P> <P> Chris Ford, a 6-2 scoring swingman, and Michael Tate, a 6-7 inside force, lead  the way for the Pathfinders, who won the 3-A title two seasons ago. Point guard  Robert Moore controls Fremont's offense but a full-court pressure defense will  again be the key for the Pathfinders.  </P> <P> 4. FAIRFAX  </P> <P> Western League (4-A Division)  </P> <P> Last Season: 22-6  </P> <P> Coach Harvey Kitani may have the sleeper team of the season, led by 6-5 Ryan  Hickman and scoring guard Burt Harris. Last season Hickman averaged 18.5 points  and 12.5 rebounds a game, and Harris has been the leading scorer for the Lions  so far this year.  </P> <P> 5. CARSON  </P> <P> Pacific League (4-A Division)  </P> <P> Last Season: 19-9  </P> <P> Carson is best known as a football power, but this season, Coach Richard Masson  has a basketball team that could duplicate its counterpart's success.  </P> <P> Leading the way for the Colts is Rudy Washington, a 6-4 junior forward. The key  for the Colts, though, could be the return of Khary Stanley, a 6-9 junior  center, who has been out with a back injury. Look for Carson to be a force late  in the season when it can feature a deep lineup with Stanley and several  football players , who will return to action.  </P> <P> 6. WESTCHESTER  </P> <P> Western League (4-A Division)  </P> <P> Last Season: 16-11  </P> <P> The Comets have only one starting senior, but he is LeRoi O'Brien, a 6-8  center. O'Brien averaged double figures in both scoring and rebounding last  season. Coach Ed Azzam will look for leadership from O'Brien, but juniors James  Gray, Lorenzo Ball and Marty Cotwright will have to contribute as well.  </P> <P> 7. RESEDA CLEVELAND  </P> <P> North Valley League (4-A Division)  </P> <P> Last Season: 21-5  </P> <P> The Cavaliers had Crenshaw on the ropes in the 4-A semifinals last season  before losing in overtime, 91-90. Kevin Crider, who previously coached at Los  Angeles High, is now the coach at Cleveland and has an experienced starting  five. Kayheed Murray, a 6-5 senior, and Brandon Martin, a 6-4 junior, give the  Cavaliers a solid forward combination. Cleveland will need time to adjust to  Cryder, who is the team's fourth coach in a little more than a year, but should  be a contender for the playoffs.  </P> <P> 8. WASHINGTON  </P> <P> Southern League (4-A Division)  </P> <P> Last Season: 12-10  </P> <P> Before starting high school, Barnabas James was touted as one the area's top  players. Now, the 6-7 James is a senior and has slowly begun to live up to his  potential. James, who averaged 18 points a game last season, leads a Washington  team that will also have the scoring of guard Kevin Griffis.  </P> <P> 9. DORSEY  </P> <P> Southern League (4-A Division)  </P> <P> Last Season: 22-6  </P> <P> First-year Coach Kevin Gibson has a team that may be a year away, but look for  the Dons to get better as the season goes on. Lynell Wiggins, a 5-6 point  guard, and Juan Harris, a 6-7 center, are key returners. Depth will be a key  for the Dons with Marquette Davis, Davey Fortson and Eric Scott, who will be  joined by Keyshawn Johnson and Lamont Warren when football season ends.  </P> <P> 10. GRANADA HILLS  </P> <P> North Valley League (4-A Division)  </P> <P> Last Season: 17-9  </P> <P> The Highlanders have two starting forwards returning, Adrian Sellers and Jerry  Allen, who combined to average 19 points a game last season. Coach Bob Johnson  will feature a running attack, with point guard Jevon Lee leading the way.  </P></p>

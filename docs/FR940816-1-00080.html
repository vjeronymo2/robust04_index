			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is possible that an exchange of reintroduced wolves may occur between the central Idaho area and an experimental area established by reintroducing wolves into Yellowstone National Park. Such interchange, if it occurs, would pose no problem in determining their status because wolves from both areas would already be classified as part of nonessential experimental population. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Utilization of Federal public lands including National Forests is consistent with the legal responsibility of the Forest Service and all other Federal agencies under section 7(a)(1) of the Act to utilize their authorities in furtherance of the purposes of the Act by carrying out programs for the conservation of endangered species and threatened species. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Management <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As previously stated, the nonessential experimental population of gray wolves would be established in central Idaho by introducing gray wolves into Federal lands under authority of section 10(j) of the Act, as amended. Ongoing wolf monitoring efforts (Service 1994) would continue to document the presence of any wild wolves, and, prior to any reintroduction, the Service would make a determination of the status of any naturally occurring wolf population in this area. Wolves would not be reintroduced into central Idaho if a naturally occurring wolf population is documented in the recovery area. After introduction has been completed according to the Reintroduction Protocol (section 5 above), management of the experimental population will begin. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Forest Service and the Service will be the primary Federal agencies implementing the experimental population rule inside the boundaries of a National Forest. The States of Idaho and Montana and potentially affected Tribes will be encouraged to enter into cooperative agreements for management of the gray wolf in central Idaho and southwestern Montana. These cooperative agreements would be reviewed annually by the Service to ensure that the States and Tribes have adequate regulatory authority to conserve listed species, including the gray wolf. It is anticipated that the States and Tribes will be the primary agencies implementing this experimental population rule outside National Parks and National Wildlife Refuges. The Service will provide oversight, coordinate wolf recovery activities, and provide technical assistance. If the States and Tribes do not assume wolf management responsibilities, the Service would do so, as needed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Management of the reintroduced wolves would allow wolves to be killed or moved under some conditions by Service-authorized Federal, State, and Tribal agencies for domestic animal depredations and excessive predation on big game populations. Under some conditions, the public could harass or kill wolves attacking livestock (cattle, sheep, horses, and mules). There would be no Federal compensation program, but compensation from existing private funding sources would be encouraged. There would be no land-use restrictions applied when 6 or more wolf packs were documented in the experimental population area because sufficient wolf numbers would be available and no restrictions around den sites or other critical areas would be necessary to promote wolf recovery. Enhancement of prey populations would be encouraged. Use of toxicants lethal to wolves in areas occupied by wolves would still be prohibited by existing labeling restrictions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Wolves have a relatively high reproductive rate and, with 6 packs of wolves present in a population, about 20&hyph;25 pups could be born each year to greatly compensate for mortality that would result from management actions. The Service believes that a possible 10 per cent loss of wolves could occur due to control actions and an additional 10 per cent loss could occur from other mortality sources. However, once the number of introduced wolves has reached the goal of 6 wolf packs, the reproductive output of 6 packs of wolves would provide for a wolf population increasing at or near 22 per cent per year. This increase in numbers should easily accommodate more flexible wolf management to further address local concerns and resistance to wolf recovery efforts, and reduce the need and costs of agency actions to resolve wolf/human conflicts. Closely regulated public control also can more effectively focus on individual problem wolves as conflicts occur rather than hours or days after a problem is documented. Agency control actions would more likely target groups of wolves that contain problem individuals, whereas public control could be focused on individual problem wolves. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: DIAMOND BAR;  </P> <P> DRIVE-THROUGH BAN REJECTED  </P> <P> The City Council on Tuesday voted down a proposal to prohibit drive-through  restaurants in the city.  </P> <P> Councilman Gary Werner had proposed adopting a provision similar to San  Marino's zoning code, which bans drive-through establishments. Werner said that  San Marino has "what I consider to be the highest caliber and quality of  development," and that similar restrictions would improve the quality of life  in Diamond Bar.  </P> <P> But his motion, seconded by Mayor Phyllis Papen, lost on a 3-2 vote.  </P> <P> Council members John Forbing and Gary Miller said banning drive-throughs was  unnecessary, whereas Councilman Paul Horcher accused Werner of being "elitist."  </P> <P> "This is not San Marino, it's Diamond Bar," he said. "It's for the  middle-class, and we're proud of it."  </P></p>

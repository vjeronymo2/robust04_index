			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: USD BEATS AUSTRALIANS IN OPENER  </P> <P> The University of San Diego men's basketball team began its season with a 91-81  exhibition victory over Australia's Eastside Melbourne Spectres Friday at the  USD Sports Center.  </P> <P> Senior John Jerome, who red-shirted last season, led USD with 21 points. Senior  Craig Cottrell added 10 points. Shawn Hamilton, a community college transfer  from Mesa, Ariz., had seven rebounds, and freshman Pat Holbert had eight  assists.  </P> <P> USD took an 8-2 lead and never trailed. It took its biggest lead of the half,  42-26, with a 10-0 run with four minutes remaining. The Toreros, who  substituted freely, had a 27-point lead five minutes into the second half.  </P> <P> In the first 7:35, Jerome (6-feet-8) scored 14 of the Toreros' first 23 points,  including two three-pointers.  </P> <P> USD shot well from the floor -- 58% (38 of 66) -- but converted on just 10 of  17 free throws, three of seven in the first half.  </P> <P> Eastside Melbourne was led by Steve deLaveaga's 22 points. DeLaveaga normally  plays for San Diego's High Five America, but Melbourne was permitted to use two  American players.  </P> <P> U.S. International opens its season tonight (7:30) at Serra High against the  same Eastside Melbourne team.

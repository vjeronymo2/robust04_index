			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, May 20 (AFP) -- A conference to launch the  rebuilding of Sarajevo's infrastructure and public services  called by special UN envoy Yasushi Akashi is to be held here  next week, the UN office in the Austrian capital said on Friday  [20 May].    The two-day gathering, opening on Tuesday, is billed as a  conference to coordinate an action plan for the besieged Bosnian  capital. The aim is to mobilise widespread support for  restoring the battered city. An appeal for funds is to be made  immediately after the meeting, with another conference due in  New York within a few months to finalise matters.    The Vienna meeting is being chaired by U.S. diplomat William  Eagleton, named in March as UN civilian administrator for  Sarajevo. Participants are to include 31 countries, UN and other  international bodies, non-governmental organisations and  municipal associations.</p>

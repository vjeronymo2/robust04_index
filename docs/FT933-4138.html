			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Abiola to return 'on Sunday' Thwarted presidential candidate Moshood Abiola, widely believed to have won Nigeria's annulled June election, will return home on Sunday from abroad where he has been lobbying for foreign support, his deputy said, Reuter reports from Lagos. 'We decided that it is time he should return home,' Mr Baba Gana Kingibe, Mr Abiola's running mate in the election said. Mr Abiola has been abroad since August 3 canvassing international support for his claim to the presidency and has twice postponed returning to Nigeria for fear of his security. 'We advised him to come back on Sunday because we think it is safe for him to do so and he has agreed,' Mr Kingibe said.</p>

			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> GOINGS ON: SANTA BARBARA;  </P> <P> A LITTLE HELP;  </P> <P> A GRATEFUL JOE COCKER IS PLANNING A CONCERT TO BENEFIT HIS NEIGHBORS, VICTIMS  OF LAST MONTH'S FIRE.  </P> <P> Joe Cocker knows all about hard luck. So when his neighbors lost their homes,  possessions and peace of mind to the Painted Cave Fire of a month ago -- the  worst in Santa Barbara's history -- Cocker was eager to plan a benefit concert.  </P> <P> Even with hits such as "When the Night Comes" and "Up Where We Belong," many  still remember Cocker from his Woodstock and "Mad Dogs and Englishmen" days. In  an era that gave the world Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison and Janis Joplin -- and  then took them away -- Cocker is a survivor.  </P> <P> Years of drug and alcohol abuse almost robbed him of his health and marked him  with record companies as a high risk. And Cocker's bluesy renditions and  gravelly voice, accompanied by his characteristic contorted movements, weren't  in vogue during the disco decade.  </P> <P> And by not taking care of his own financial interests he lost most of his  earlier earnings. Without money or a job, it took Cocker most of the 1970s to  get back on his feet.  </P> <P> In 1979 he escaped Los Angeles, and the alcohol and drugs, to live on a  mountaintop in Santa Barbara. Now, in his mid-40s, Cocker can claim a string of  hits through the 1980s. He spends his time singing, as well as trout fishing  with buddies, and staying at home playing backgammon with Pam Cocker, his wife  of three years.  </P> <P> "We're just the typical homebody couple; people are surprised at how boring we  are," Pam Cocker said. "Last year Joe toured for seven and a half months, so  when we get the chance, we absolutely love to just kick back at home."  </P> <P> For a short time last month, Cocker thought his mountaintop haven had been  destroyed in the Painted Cave Fire, which demolished more than 4,500 acres and  600 residences.  </P> <P> "I was performing in Pittsburgh, and I didn't even know about the fire until  the next day," said Cocker who is touring the United States and Canada. The  newly added benefit concert at the Santa Barbara County Bowl at 7 p.m. Tuesday  is the last stop of his two-month tour.  </P> <P> "It was 6 in the morning when I saw the reports of the fire on the television,"  Cocker said. "I could recognize the mountains, and I thought that our home must  have burnt down. I was prepared for the worst."  </P> <P> But miraculously, the fire stopped just 50 yards from the front door.  </P> <P> "What worried me was that our three cats and two pigs were at home alone," Pam  Cocker said. "I asked a friend, if it came to it, to shoot the pigs rather than  have them die in the fire."  </P> <P> As it turned out, Rita and Earl, the thousand-pound porkers, slept through it  all.  </P> <P> Grateful for their own good luck, the Cockers, along with manager Michael Lang  and friend Bill Garlock, manager of the Oxnard Strawberry Festival, came up  with the idea for a benefit concert.  </P> <P> "Many of my neighbors and friends, people I have known for years, have been  hurt by this tragedy," Cocker said. "Some of them risked their lives fighting  the fire, and I want to return something to them. . . . If I can do that with  my music, I will."  </P> <P> When singer Pat Benatar learned of the concert through a mutual business  acquaintance, she offered her help as well.  </P> <P> "She and her band, and Joe and the band, and all the roadies and drivers --  everyone -- is helping out for free," said Pam Cocker, chairwoman of a  committee to disburse the money raised by the concert. "And we have use of the  County Bowl for free, and we've gotten free publicity and free printing, free  everything.  </P> <P> "I've never done a benefit before where everyone was so willing to give all  they can," added Pam Cocker, a veteran of political fund raising.  </P> <P> She hopes that the concert will raise about $100,000, and that the reception  after the show, which will be attended by both singers, the bands and a number  of other celebrities, will pull in another few thousand.  </P> <P> Tickets for the reception are $25 and are available at Gary Paul clothing  store, Compact Disc and Tape Stores in Santa Barbara and Goleta, the Santa  Barbara Athletic Club and Distinctions Hair Salon. Tickets for the show are  $25.50, $23.50 and $19.50 and are available at the box office and at  Ticketmaster outlets.  </P> <P> The earthquake of 1925, World War II and a serious drought in 1948 were the  only three disasters to interrupt Santa Barbara's biggest annual event, Old  Spanish Days.  </P> <P> But neither the severe drought conditions nor the devastating Painted Cave Fire  will interfere with this year's festival. Better known as "Fiesta," the  celebration will take place Aug. 1 through 5 throughout Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> To the cultured, Fiesta is a tribute to the city's Spanish and Mexican  heritage. To the business-minded, Fiesta is a way to get tourists into town.  And to the masses, Fiesta is a five-day party.  </P> <P> Besides the array of wine, music and dance, Fiesta features a large selection  of organized events. These include a parade down State and Cabrillo streets at  1 p.m. Friday, a children's parade at 10 a.m. Saturday, a rodeo and horse show  at 8 p.m. Thursday and Friday and outdoor markets, food and entertainment,  including Gypsy flamenco music and dance.  </P> <P> For information about the festival and dates and times and prices of individual  events, call (805) 962-8101.  </P> <P> While most of Santa Barbara celebrates the city's Hispanic legacy, Oak Park  will be the site of the 17th annual Greek Festival. Bouzouki music, authentic  dances and moussaka, baklava and ouzo can all be found there from 11 a.m. to 7  p.m. Saturday and Sunday. At 3:30 Sunday, George Alexiades, somewhat of a local  legend, will perform his famous "table dance" in which he takes the corner of a  dinner table in his teeth, lifts it -- no hands allowed -- then spins it around  in time to the music.  </P> <P> And for those interested in Chinese culture, the Santa Barbara Museum of Art  will open its exhibit, "From Inside the Great Wall: Recent Acquisitions of  Chinese Costumes and Textiles," on Saturday. Featured among the very rare  costumes, accessories and furnishings is a sampling of court costumes from the  Qing Dynasty (1644-1912).  </P> <P> Even more rare than Chinese costumes and textiles is an appearance by Grammy  award-winning musician Wynton Marsalis at a small venue. "We wanted more of a  New Orleans club, speak-easy-type atmosphere where it's more intimate and  people don't have to sit glued to their seats," said Dawn Elder of Crossroads  Entertainment. The 25-year-old jazz trumpet player, who has won Grammy awards  in both the jazz and classical categories, will perform at the Longbar, 111  State St., at 7:30 and 10:30 p.m. Tuesday, (805) 564-1215. Tickets are $16.50,  $20 at the door. General admission and dinner patrons are admitted first. MAJA  RADEVICH  </P></p>

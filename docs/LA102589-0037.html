			<p><P> October 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> SIGNS OF A THAW IN HARRY'S GIG AT COUNTRY CLUB  </P> <P> Deborah Harry opened her show at the Country Club on Monday not with the  expected bang, but with a touch of restraint. It was daring and surprising  enough to enrich the rest of the set, which wasn't all that daring or  surprising -- at least until the final encore, when Harry saluted two New York  influences with versions of the Velvet Underground's "Waiting for the Man" and  the Ramones' "Pet Sematary."  </P> <P> Instead of a splashy Blondie hit or an upbeat tune from her new album, the  new-wave-era pinup girl began with a low-key, Peggy Lee-style version of Smokey  Robinson's 1967 Marvelettes hit "The Hunter Gets Captured by the Game." With  its eerie mood and odd little stairstep lines, the song demanded every bit of  Harry's limited expressive and technical range. It also caught the crowd off  guard Monday, drawing them in instead of blowing them away.  </P> <P> From there it was a more predictable pastiche of Blondie songs (all four of the  New York group's No. 1 hits) and numbers from her new "Def, Dumb &amp; Blonde"  LP. Of the latter, only "I Want That Man" has the spark and buoyancy of the old  stuff, but her five-piece band -- which includes Blondie architect Chris Stein  and a drummer, Jimmy Clark, with the moves and drive of Blondie's Clem Burke --  mowed through it all with such vigor that the momentum rarely let up. Not too  slick, not too sloppy.  </P> <P> Even though she's still looking for her footing as a solo act seven years after  the end of Blondie, Harry retains her Warhol-superstar cool, and remains a  puzzling performer: stiff but sometimes endearing, aloof but somehow able to  connect with a loyal following ranging from pop purists to soft-core  slam-dancers to true believers -- like a guy frantically holding up a leather  jacket with her picture on it, desperate for her notice. She did -- one  indication of a welcome thaw. This was noticeably warmer than Blondie was at  the end.  </P> <P> Harry has moved over to the Roxy, where she continues through Thursday before  shows at the Coach House on Saturday and the Bacchanal in San Diego on  Sunday.RICHARD CROMELIN  </P></p>

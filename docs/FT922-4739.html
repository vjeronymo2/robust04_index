			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Technology: Clear about liquid crystal The LCD project started in 1984, with the long-term goal of producing flat screens for high-definition televisions to be manufactured by Ferguson. It received a boost with funding from the UK government's Alvey and Joers research programmes from 1986. When Thorn sold Ferguson to Thomson of France in 1987, 'its home within the company disappeared but a clear decision was taken that this was a very valuable development and CRL would continue to invest to take it to the point of licensing,' says Ashok Vaidya, CRL commercial manager. Thorn has concentrated on a type of display called digital ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLCD) which has largely been ignored by the Japanese electronics industry with the exception of Canon. It has many theoretical advantages over the thin film transistor (TFT) technology favoured by the majority - simpler, cheaper and faster to respond to electrical impulses - but it has been difficult to develop as a practical screen because it is sensitive to shocks. The FLCD demonstrator built by CRL is based on the VGA graphics standard for up-market portable computers. It shows good colour picture quality and a wide angle of view. Above all, it is rugged and durable - a drawback of other FLCD systems has been their tendency to fail if knocked. CRL has just signed its first FLCD licensing agreement with a large Japanese electronics manufacturer and 'is working to secure further licensees'. As Vaidya concedes, it has been difficult to persuade companies to take up FLCD when most of the industry is so committed to developing TFT technology. Another problem is that Thorn has no FLCD production line to show potential licensees who have doubts about its suitability as a technology for mass-production. Even so, CRL is continuing to develop FLCD because Thorn researchers are convinced that it has the best long-term potential of all display systems. 'We're concentrating on taking the technology leaps, rather than grinding through the production engineering work, which is best done by manufacturers,' Vaidya says.</p>

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Walker's QC accuses two 'evil directors' Mr George Walker, the former chairman of the Brent Walker property and leisure group who is accused of illegal profit-boosting, may have been taken advantage of by two 'evil' directors of the company's film division, the Old Bailey was told yesterday. In his closing speech to the jury, Mr Colin Nicholls, QC for Mr Walker, said he still denied prosecution claims that the company's profits had been fraudulently inflated by Pounds 19m. However, it was possible that Mr John Quested and Mr Donald Anderson, the former managing director and finance director of the Brent Walker film subsidiary, had 'taken advantage' of Mr Walker's trust and friendship for their own purposes. Mr Walker and Mr Wilfred Aquilina, a former Brent Walker finance director, deny charges of theft, false accounting and conspiring to falsify the Brent Walker accounts. Mr Quested and Mr Anderson have been named by the prosecution as co-conspirators. Mr Nicholls said that Mr Quested, the former managing director of the film division, was 'well in evidence' at the time the fraud was supposed to have taken place. He was 'in the background, but you can do a lot in the background'. His conduct was 'highly suspect', added Mr Nicholls. Mr Quested was a 'practised forger' and the prosecution had accepted that some documents in the case might have been forged by him. It could be that in letting staff look after the detailed work of deals, Mr Walker had trusted them too much. During the period when the fraud was alleged to have occurred, 'these two evil men' had been left to do what they wanted, Mr Nicholls suggested. 'Is the fault of Mr Walker that he trusted his friends too much? That may be one of the reasons why he is here now,' Mr Nicholls said. The trial continues today.</p>

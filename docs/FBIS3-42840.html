			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Skachkov] </F>   [Excerpts] On 3 February 1994 deputies finally managed to  begin discussing President Leonid Kravchuk's proposal on  Ukraine's annexation to the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of  Nuclear Weapons as a nonnuclear state, and on reconciling the  trilateral Moscow Declaration with the Ukrainian Supreme  Council's decree of 18 February of last year regarding  ratification of the START-I treaty. Reports on this matter were  presented by Leonid Kravchuk and Minister of Foreign Affairs  Anatoliy Zlenko. The president confirmed his prior statement  that the Moscow Declaration was now one in a series of documents  already adopted by Ukraine on the road to a nonnuclear status,  and that it is "a political compromise by the three powers on  the fundamental questions of nuclear disarmament." Kravchuk also  declared that the declaration also meets the fundamental  stipulations of the parliamentary decree. The explanation Leonid  Kravchuk gave for the fact itself of the advent of this document  was that Ukraine, which had not joined the Nonproliferation  Treaty, had found itself at the brink of international isolation.    [Passage omitted] In the end, the necessary majority voted  in  favor of the Supreme Council's decree, consisting of two items.  It is stated in the first item that with regard for the measures  proposed by Leonid Kravchuk for implementing the parliamentary  decree of 18 November of last year, and for the steps taken in  response by Russia and the USA, Ukraine was "lifting the  stipulating concerning Article 5 of the Protocol to the  Strategic Offensive Arms Treaty, signed in Lisbon on 23 May  1992." By the second item the Ukrainian Supreme Council charged  the government to exchange certificates of ratification of the  START-I treaty and to concurrently begin the work of signing  specific agreements on the procedure and conditions of Ukraine's  nuclear disarmament, foreseen by other stipulations of the 18  November parliamentary decree. A decision was made not to  examine the matter of Ukraine's annexation to the  Nonproliferation Treaty as a state not possessing nuclear  weapons until special discussion of the text itself of the  Nonproliferation Treaty in parliament.    It is now becoming obvious that on one hand Ukraine has  taken  yet another step in the direction of the world community on the  road of nuclear disarmament, since it lifted its parliamentary  stipulation concerning Article 5 of the Lisbon Protocol, which  requires Ukraine's annexation to the Nonproliferation Treaty as  a nonnuclear state. As we know, it was stated in that  stipulation, dated 18 November of last year and designated as No  3, that "Ukraine does not consider itself to be bound by Article  5 of the Lisbon Protocol." But now this stipulation has been  lifted, and Ukraine has declared its readiness to fulfill the  Lisbon Protocol.    However, on one hand Ukraine is clearly in no hurry to  exchange ratification certificates on the START-I treaty, since  other stipulations of the said decree, which foresee the signing  of a number of international agreements, remain in effect. Among  them are agreements on international guarantees of Ukraine's  national security, on the conditions of economic, financial,  scientific and technical aid in fulfillment of the START-I  treaty, on guaranteed servicing of Ukrainian nuclear weapons by  Russian specialists, on reexamining the conditions of financing  inspection activities foreseen by the said decree, on the  possibilities for using missile silos for peaceful purposes, on  the conditions of using weapon materials from eliminated nuclear  weapons, and on guarantees of compensation for the material  value of these components. In addition the stipulations  separately require compensation for tactical nuclear weapons,  and the signing of a special agreement on the conditions and  priority of transfer of nuclear ammunition to Russia and on  coordination of the schedule for this transfer.    In his concluding remarks Leonid Kravchuk told the deputies  that he received a letter from Bill Clinton, who promised to  double the amount appropriated for the destruction of Ukrainian  missiles. It was announced that a group of experts from the USA,  Russia and Ukraine will begin work as early as in February. They  will determine the value of the exported tactical nuclear  weapons, and the procedure for paying compensation to Ukraine.  Valentin Lemesh, chairman of the deputy commission on problems  of defense and state security, told reporters: "We have taken  one more step, and now let them take a step in our direction,  let them give us something else besides talk, and begin  appropriating at least some sort of assistance."    The official interpretation of the adopted degree has not  yet  been made public, but it is clear that the decision reached by  the deputies will have significance both to the internal  political life of Ukraine and to the world community. In its  opposition to executive power and the president, by collective  effort the parliament took at least three important steps: The  image of Leonid Kravchuk as the sole peacemaker and  unquestioning proponent of Ukraine's nonnuclear status was  severely shaken in the eyes of the Ukrainian public. The Supreme  Council confirmed that blame for the current economic situation,  which has placed Ukraine on the brink of nationwide catastrophe,  lies not only with the parliament but also with the president,  and ultimately it "charged" Leonid Kravchuk to do more  concretely and more swiftly something he doesn't like very much  and doesn't want very much, and namely, to sign international  agreements advantageous to the country.    And in the international arena, by accepting the Lisbon  Protocol the Ukrainian Supreme Council is forcing the world  community to choose: Either go on with the policy of pressure on  Ukraine and demand its adoption of the Nonproliferation Treaty,  or finally start helping Ukraine materially, and offer specific  guarantees of security.</p>

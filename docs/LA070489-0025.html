			<p><P> July 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> T-Bill Rates Drop: Interest rates on short-term Treasury securities fell to  their lowest level in eight months. The Treasury Department sold $6.6 billion  in three-month bills at an average discount rate of 7.96%, down from 8.07% last  week. Another $6.6 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average discount  rate of 7.63%, down from 7.78% last week. The rates were the lowest since  three-month bills sold for 7.82% last Nov. 14 and six-month bills averaged  7.48% last Oct. 31. The discount rates understate the actual return to  investors -- 8.24% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling for  $9,798.80, and 8.05% for a six-month bill selling for $9,614.30.  </P></p>

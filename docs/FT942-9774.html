			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / International Company News: Mitel ahead despite tough fourth quarter Mitel, the manufacturer of PBXs, integrated circuits and telephone equipment formerly owned by British Telecom, had a tough fourth quarter, Reuter reports from Toronto. Net profit for the three months to March 25 fell to CDollars 4.8m (USDollars 3.5m) or 3 cents a share, from CDollars 11.9m or 14 cents a year earlier. Revenues for the period increased to CDollars 145.2m from CDollars 118.1m previously. Gross margins eased in the quarter due to non-recurring stock write-offs and higher manufacturing costs as well as an unfavourable product mix in its semiconductor business. The performance for the full year improved, however, with net earnings climbing to CDollars 20.7m, or 16 cents a share, from a profit of CDollars 2.6m, or a loss of 1 cent per share. Sales for the year were CDollars 496.4m against CDollars 423.4m with gross margins rising to 45 per cent from 44 per cent. 'Our efforts will continue in the area of cost control as we focus on R&amp;D and market development in line with Mitel's strategy,' said president and chief executive Mr John Millard. Selling, general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales fell by 1.0 per cent in the year as a whole. Mitel's order backlog was CDollars 86.6m at the end of fiscal 1994 against CDollars 81.5m a year earlier.</p>

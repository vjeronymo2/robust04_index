			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / The Markets: Nickel labour talks loom - Commodities Anticipation of the expiry of labour contracts on Wednesday at Falconbridge of Canada, the second biggest western nickel producer, has been one of the few constructive factors for the nickel market in recent weeks. The possibility of supply disruption during renegotiations was one of the principal factors behind the Dollars 215 rally that lifted the three months price of the metal at the London Metal Exchange close to Dollars 6,000 a tonne last week. With world nickel stocks still at uncomfortably high levels, the prospect of Falconbridge losing output and the strengthening in the market that would surely bring about is far from unwelcome to other producers. And having cut costs to the bone and with prices lan-guishing at around Dollars 2.70 a pound, the company cannot be expected to be in a generous mood when it receives the unions' pay and conditions demands. So metals traders will be watching closely after Wednesday to judge the mood of negotiators on both sides. The nickel market could in any case soon be emerging from its recent gloom if Sumitomo, the Japanese steel maker, is right in its opinion, expressed last week, that a boom in stainless steel demand is just around the corner. Stainless steel producers are big users of nickel. There are also hopes that problems at Norilsk of Russia, the world's biggest nickel producer, could soon reverse the surge in exports to the west after the break up of the Soviet Union that played such a large part in the collapse of prices for the metal. Other events this week include tomorrow's grain and feed trade fair in Hamburg and, from Wednesday, a five-day, Metal Bulletin-sponsored Asian Steel and Raw Materials Conference in Beijing. Wednesday also sees publication by the UK Home Grown Cereals Authority of first results from its 1994 wheat quality survey and the retirement of Mr Aldo Hofmeister as buffer stock manager of the International Natural Rubber Organisation.</p>

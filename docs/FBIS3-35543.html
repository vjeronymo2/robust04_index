			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] Brothers: As we proceed with firm steps and solid  determination to achieve our national objectives, destroying all  obstacles on the path of our march, we should be more alert,  have an honest national awareness, and place Palestine -- land  and one people -- over all considerations. The objective is to  deprive the enemy of opportunities and to foil the seditions  which the enemy is trying to create to undermine our national  unity by pushing us toward despair and internecine fighting, God  forbid.    O brothers: With the exacerbating political confrontation,  the procrastination and prevarication by Israeli officials, and  the escalating Israeli repressive acts against our steadfast  Palestinian people in the occupied homeland, we must be fully  aware that the enemy will not give in easily to the achievements  accomplished by our people under the banner of their sole,  legitimate leadership, the PLO. The enemy will lie in wait to  attack and liquidate these achievements.    The Israeli enemy is endeavoring to evade all its pledges  and  commitments contained in the Declaration of Principles  agreement. The evidence is its continuous attempts to [word  indistinct] the Palestinian negotiator and to (?delay)  withdrawal from the agreed areas and its desperate attempts to  delay the release of Palestinian detainees from Israeli jails.  This is in addition to its continuous procrastination in  transferring powers to the national Palestinian authority in the  areas from which it will withdraw under the pretext that all  these issues need more discussion and more (?recommendations).    Hence, it is evident that the enemy is trying, through all  this, to gain time and prepare the road for a new scheme which,  this time, aims to create seditions and sow discord in front of  the national Palestinian authority. The enemy wants to show  that this authority is unable to tackle the situation and that  it cannot run the affairs of the Palestinian people in the  interim period. The objective is to entrench occupation as the  best way to maintain security and stability in these areas.    As they have always proved, our people can -- through their  awareness, steadfastness, unity, and cohesion -- make the  designs of aggressors backfire. Those who try to encroach on  our people's steadfastness and march toward liberation and  independence must know full well that he who plays with fire  will burn his fingers and that he who plants thorns will harvest  storm.</p>

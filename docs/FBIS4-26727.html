			<p>BFN     [Text] The provincial party committee general office and  people's government general office recently issued a circular  urging all areas across the province to take forceful measures  to crack down on crimes relating to cultural relics and  energetically protect the province's cultural relics in light of  actual local conditions.    The circular stated: This year has seen a growing number of  crimes relating to cultural relics in various cities and  counties across the province. The situation has even become  very serious in a few areas where organized criminals dig up and  steal valuables from a large number of ancient tombs in a  planned way.    The circular urged the province's public security,  procuratorial, and judicial organs as well as cultural, cultural  relics protection, industrial, commercial, and customs  departments to strengthen cooperation with one another in the  on-going struggle against crimes relating to cultural relics and  further improve the province's cultural relics protection work.  The public security organs should, the circular stated,  immediately organize competent personnel to investigate and  crack cases of stealing or smuggling cultural relics; severely  punish criminals involved in such cases; tighten control over  the cultural relics market; and ban the black market on which  cultural relics are sold against the law.    The circular emphatically noted: The party committees,  people's governments, and departments and units concerned across  the province should further understand the importance of  cultural relics protection work and be fully aware of the  harmfulness of crimes relating to cultural relics so as to place  state cultural relics protection high on the agenda; earnestly  organize people to severely and frequently crack down on crimes  relating to cultural relics; resolutely put an end to and crack  down on crimes relating to cultural relics; and strive to bring  about a fundamental turn for the better in the province's  cultural relics protection work.</p>

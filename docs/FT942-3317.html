			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / UK Company News: UK growth behind 28% rise at Attwoods Strong UK growth helped Attwoods, the waste management company, to increase third quarter pre-tax profits by 27 per cent to Pounds 3.8m, on sales Pounds 2.3m lower at Pounds 89.2m. The group was still struggling to overcome difficulties in Germany, however, where recession has hit margins. For the nine months to April 30, pre-tax profits were 43 per cent lower at Pounds 12.8m on sales 5 per cent ahead to Pounds 267.7m. The profits included a Pounds 2.7m exceptional charge for settling litigation in the US. Mr Ken Foreman, chief executive, said 1994 had proved to be difficult. However, he expected a return to profits growth in 1995. UK profits improved 39 per cent to Pounds 2.9m, on the back of both volume and price increases. Further price increases had been implemented in May, which would help profits in last quarter. The US solid waste business had performed well in spite of a 24 per cent fall in operating profits to Pounds 22.3m for the nine months period. The previous year benefited from Hurricane Andrew. Mr Foreman said cash flow had covered the costs of all dividend payments in the first nine months. Attwoods was expected to maintain the payout this year. Normalised earnings for the three months were 0.93p (1.42p).</p>

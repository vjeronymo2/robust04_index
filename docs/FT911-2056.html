			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Beige Book shows activity still weak ECONOMIC activity remains weak in much of the US but there are some indications that the decline may be bottoming out, according to the Federal Reserve's latest assessment of regional economic trends - known as the Beige Book. Retail sales were still sluggish in most areas, with no sign of a sustained improvement following the end of the Gulf war. Retail inventories were lean but higher consumer confidence had yet to be translated into 'solid sales'. Several districts, including Kansas City, Cleveland and Atlanta, noted higher car sales but most reported little improvement. Dallas reported sharply lower car sales. Manufacturing output showed signs of bottoming out in much of the nation. Boston, New York and Chicago were among areas reporting stable or slightly improving conditions. St Louis and Dallas said conditions were still getting worse. Several districts reported strong exports. There were signs of life in residential real estate markets across the nation, with most districts reporting increased sales of new and existing homes. Non-residential construction remained weak. Wage increases generally appeared modest with input prices in manufacturing flat or falling. Loan demand was flat or slightly up in eight of the 12 districts. But credit restrictions were hampering corporate investment plans in New England. The report was prepared by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco based on data up to April 22.</p>

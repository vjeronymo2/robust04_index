			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / International Company News: Canadian banks' credit rating reviewed ROYAL BANK of Canada and National Bank of Canada are having their credit ratings reviewed for possible downgrading in the wake of the bankruptcy filings by Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian-based property company, writes Simon London. However, Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, said it had affirmed the credit ratings of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Bank of Montreal, Bank of Nova Scotia and Toronto-Dominion Bank. S&amp;P said the problems of O&amp;Y 'underscored the likelihood that property markets worldwide will continue to experience high office vacancy rates and diminishing underlying property values.' That set of circumstances would have a negative impact on the banks' assets quality, S&amp;P added. The ratings under review are RBC's AA long term senior debt rating, and the NBC's A1 commercial paper rating.</p>

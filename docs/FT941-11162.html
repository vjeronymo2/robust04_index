			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Fed credit curbs send Dow tumbling Wall Street US stocks yesterday suffered their worst setback in over two years after the Federal Reserve announced that its policy-making body had decided to tighten credit conditions, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 96.24 at 3,871.42. It was its biggest fall in the single day since November 15, 1991. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 plunged 11.41 to 469.81. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was 8.89 lower at 478.29, and the Nasdaq composite 20.51 off at 777.28. Volume on the NYSE was very heavy, with 377m shares traded by the close. Declining issues outnumbered advances by 2,032 to 296. After a soft opening, the market went into a tail spin after Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, said that the Federal Open MarketCommittee had voted to increase pressure on reserve positions, a move associated with a slight rise in short-term rates. Share prices, which have prosperedunder the Fed's long-held policy of accommodation, plunged on the news, with the Dow index falling about 40 points within minutes of the statement. Stockspulled off of their session lows soon after, helped in part by indications thatthe Fed would nudge up its target for the key Fed Funds rate by only 25 basis points to 3.25 per cent. While an early move had been expected, the financial markets were nevertheless surprised by the unprecedented announcement of the Fed's intentions. the At first, the bond market displayed a cooler reaction than equities in the face of the long-anticipated Fed move, intended to staunch incipient inflationary pressures in the economy. But losses started to mount in the afternoon, especially in the intermediate segment of the maturity range, with thefive-year note down  19/32 at 98 21/32 and the yield rising to 5.303 per cent late in the day. When bonds started to sag, the sell-off in stocks accelerated, with the Dow finally hitting bottom at the close. Financial issues and utilities,which are the most sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates, were among the worst performers. Citicorp was marked down Dollars 2 to Dollars 40 1/2 , Chase Manhattan Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 33 3/4 and Wells Fargo Dollars 6 5/8 to Dollars 128 7/8 . Brokerage houses were also hit hard, with Morgan Stanley dropping Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 74 5/8 and Merrill Lynch shedding Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 41 1/2 . Amid the fresh indication that the economy may not have fared as well as expected last month, cyclical issues, including automobile, metals and heavy equipment companies, were also down. General Motors dropped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 61 5/8 , Alcoa Dollars 2 1/8 and 3M Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 104 1/2  . On the Nasdaq, technology stocks led the retreat. Microsoft lost Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 82 1/4 , Sun Microsystems Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 25 1/2 and Wellfleet Communications Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 70 3/8 . Canada The Toronto TSE-300 composite index recordedits largest single-day drop since October 1989, in continued heavy trading. It fell 113.09 points, or 2.48 per cent, to 4,447.19, with declines trouncing advances 694 to 194.</p>

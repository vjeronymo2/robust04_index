			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: India aims for sugar self-suficiency India expects to increase its sugar production to 12.2m tonnes from 9.8m tonnes and to be self-sufficient in the commodity in the season starting October this year. This reverses a steady decline in sugar production over the past three years, when the country had to rely on imports to meet domestic demand. Mr Kalpnath Rai, the Food minister, said this week that the Narasimha Rao government's policy of offering remunerative prices to sugar farmers had yielded a bumper cane crop in the 1994-95 season. India imported 1.9m tonnes of sugar this year, though last year's production of 9.8m tonnes was up by 24 per cent over the previous year. The import of 1m tonnes through government-owned trading companies led to a controversy and a subsequent jump in sugar prices. The country's sugar industry launched a campaign for complete deregulation of the sugar market, saying that plant capacity lay idle because of the government's system of monitoring the distribution of cane. The government has yet to decide on the issue. The minister said the government had cleared 74 licences for the setting up of sugar factories, which would raise sugar production by another 2.5m tonnes in the near future. Mr Rai said the total price payable to cane growers this season increased to Rs54.43bn, compared to Rs44.23bn in 1993-94. Almost 99 per cent of the amount had already been paid by sugar mills to growers as a result of the government's efforts. The government distributes sugar through a subsidised public distribution system using ration cards. Sugar is available on the open market but at much higher prices.</p>

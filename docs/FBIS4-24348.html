			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Rachel Rawlings in Harare] </F>   [Text] The Zimbabwe Government has decided to cash in on  the increasingly peaceful atmosphere in the southern African  subregion. At one time, the Zimbabwe army was heavily committed  in Mozambique and also facing the threat of South African  destabilization, but now it seems there is going to be a peace  dividend. From Harare, Rachel Rawlings reports:    President Mugabe announced his government's intention to cut  15,000 posts in the army, thus reducing its size by about  one-third [figures as heard]. Opening a new parliamentary  session today, President Mugabe said the general tranquility  within Zimbabwe as well as the South African elections and  Mozambican peace accord meant the time was right for the cut,  but he reassured any fears of sudden mass unemployment, saying  the government wouldn't simply put on the streets the affected  young men and women who have so loyally, selflessly, and  gallantly defended the country's sovereignty. He said  demobilization would be carried out in two phases and the former  soldiers would receive training in civilian skills.    The future of the army had been posing a serious problem.  Zimbabwe's structural adjustment program calls for a substantial  reduction in government's spending. The defense budget is  massive, eating up nearly 10 percent of government expenditure,  but it was increased last year despite the scaling down of  military activities. This caused widespread dissatisfaction,  because basic social services, such as health and education,  became increasingly expensive for ordinary people.    On the other hand, as unemployment spirals ever upwards, it  could have been dangerous to have thousands of unemployed  military personnel joining the millions already searching  fruitlessly for work. The peace dividend might be a nice idea,  but it won't be clear until next month's budget exactly how much  money will be saved and whether any of it will be reassigned to  other parts of government or whether most of it will be used up  in the proposed retraining program.</p>

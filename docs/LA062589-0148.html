			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COMPLAINTS SHADOW GOOD-WILL TOUR OF SUNSHINE CANYON LANDFILL  </P> <P> Los Angeles city officials and leaders of half a dozen neighborhood groups  toured the Sunshine Canyon Landfill in Sylmar on Saturday morning to discuss  waste disposal problems with the operators of the dump, Browning-Ferris  Industries.  </P> <P> In the past, Browning-Ferris has quarreled with residents over the dump, one of  the largest in Los Angeles County. The idea Saturday was to bring together  landfill operators, San Fernando Valley residents and Los Angeles city  officials for a discussion of what both sides called the city's looming  waste-disposal crisis.  </P> <P> "We're not here to talk about Sunshine Canyon," said attorney Richard H. Close,  president of the Coalition of Valley Communities. "We've got a trash crisis  here in the city. We need to talk about how the city is going to solve it."  </P> <P> Four of the nine landfills in the county are scheduled to be closed in the next  five years, prompting concern that there will be no place to put the about  45,000 tons of garbage produced in the county each day.  </P> <P> Four landfills rim the northern Valley, and many residents have charged that  the dumps are mismanaged and allow toxic gases and materials to endanger  surrounding residences.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, a Los Angeles City Council committee upheld a decision by the  city's Board of Zoning Appeals that will cut dumping at the Sunshine Canyon  site by 90% after 1989. The decision, which Browning-Ferris intends to appeal  to the entire council, came as the result of longstanding complaints by Granada  Hills residents about the dump's odors, dust and litter.  </P> <P> Browning-Ferris held the tour to improve its image and to push for plans to  extend the dump over the city boundary into the county.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Frequent Inspections  </P> <P> "This site is inspected roughly 300 times a year by the state, the city, the  county and the air quality district," Browning-Ferris Vice President Les  Bittenson said as the bus lumbered to the top of the landfill, a  1,700-foot-high mesa under which lies millions of tons of garbage.  </P> <P> To the north of the landfill lies an untouched canyon on county land, where  Browning-Ferris hopes to expand. At a distance, goats could be seen grazing at  the foot of the canyon. "There's capacity for 13 million tons of garbage  there," Bittenson said.  </P> <P> Some activists seemed impressed, but not Granada Hills resident Frank McArthur,  who called the proposed expansion "a bad idea."  </P> <P> Milena Miller of the Reseda Community Assn. said the landfill was "a necessary  evil," but added that it was important to eliminate garbage "at the source"  with recycling programs.  </P> <P> Several community activists attacked City Councilman Hal Bernson for his  support for development projects that they said are contributing to the growth  of the city's population and adding to the thousands of tons of garbage  produced by the city each day.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'People Keep Coming'  </P> <P> Bernson responded angrily: "The problem is that people are going to keep coming  to Southern California for jobs, for homes. You're not going to be able to stop  growth. That's ridiculous."  </P> <P> Miller appeared unconvinced. "I'm seething inside, Mr. Bernson. Don't tell me  that growth is not an issue," she said. "I'm doing my part and you're telling  me I have to accept this growth all around me."  </P> <P> Bernson said part of the problem may be solved if a dump proposed for Elsmere  Canyon in the Santa Clarita Valley is approved.  </P> <P> Lynn Wessell, a spokesman for Browning-Ferris, said the solution was the  proposed expansion of the Sunshine Canyon Landfill. "We're here operating  safely; we just have to move over a little," he said. "We expect county  approval. We've got community support."  </P></p>

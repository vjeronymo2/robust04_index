			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> ROBBINS SUED OVER PROPERTY PURCHASE;  </P> <P> DISPUTE: A BUSINESSMAN ALLEGES THAT ROBBINS THREATENED TO USE POLITICAL CLOUT  TO PREVENT HIM FROM DEVELOPING ACREAGE NEAR MARINA DEL REY. ROBBINS DENIES  TRYING TO THWART THE DEAL.  </P> <P> State Sen. Alan Robbins warned a Newport Beach businessman trying to buy and  develop choice property near Marina del Rey that he "would never get" a crucial  government permit because the lawmaker wanted to acquire the land himself, the  businessman has charged in court papers.  </P> <P> Robert Blake also said Robbins (D-Tarzana) boasted that he had former Los  Angeles City Council President Pat Russell "tied up" in connection with his  efforts from 1985 to 1987 to buy 16 acres located along Lincoln Boulevard. The  property is subject to city planning rules.  </P> <P> Blake's allegations are contained in documents filed recently as part of a  complex web of civil lawsuits involving Blake, Robbins and a wealthy La Jolla  car dealer, Jeremy Simms. The three were partners in a 3,800-acre parcel of  Ventura County land that sold last year for $22 million. The profits from the  sale also are a subject of the suits.  </P> <P> The litigation -- which already includes enough paper work to form a stack more  than three feet high -- recently prompted the state attorney general's office  to reopen a 1988 investigation that cleared Robbins of allegations that he  illegally used campaign funds to help finance the Ventura County deal.  </P> <P> No trial dates have been set in the suits, the bulk of which are pending in  Santa Monica Superior Court.  </P> <P> In an interview, Robbins denied that he tried to thwart Blake over the Lincoln  Boulevard land. He said he didn't even meet Blake until after he, Robbins, had  signed a deal to purchase the first group of properties he wanted.  </P> <P> According to court documents, Robbins and a different partner purchased the  land for $12.2 million and sold it last year for a reported $45 million.  </P> <P> The veteran lawmaker amassed a considerable fortune before and during his 17  years in the state Senate. He is a lawyer and licensed real estate broker, and  he and a succession of partners have financed apartment complexes, medical  buildings and office towers.  </P> <P> Blake said in court papers that Robbins complained that Blake's attempts to buy  the land were "messing up" efforts by Robbins' firm, Marina East Holding  Properties, to acquire it.  </P> <P> Blake said Robbins told him the property could be developed only if the  successful buyer "got a left-turn lane authorized for entrance and various  other governmental approvals."  </P> <P> "He added that if I got the property, and his group lost it, I would never get  the left-hand turn lane and might have a difficult time in obtaining other  required approvals," Blake said in court papers. "He told me that if we took  the property from him, he would make sure it would not be worth our while."  </P> <P> Robbins said, however, that the property Blake was trying to buy actually was a  different property, adjacent to parcels Robbins already had signed deals to  acquire.  </P> <P> He said Blake wanted to erect a hotel on the land and asked Robbins for  permission to build a driveway through Robbins' lots. The lawmaker agreed, but  Blake was never able to carry out the hotel deal, Robbins said.  </P> <P> "What we negotiated about him buying was access to private property," Robbins  said.  </P> <P> Former City Council President Russell, who was defeated for reelection in 1987,  laughed when told of Blake's charge as it related to her. She said she talked  to Robbins about the land only after he purchased it and that she "would have  blown a fuse" if the lawmaker had tried to enlist her political influence to  cripple Blake's efforts.  </P> <P> "Most people would laugh at the idea that Robbins had me tied up," she said. "I  think I still have a reputation that you can't get me tied up."  </P> <P> Blake said he eventually dropped his bid for the Lincoln Boulevard property and  Robbins offered to provide him with "various profitable business  opportunities."  </P> <P> In 1986, Blake became a partner with Robbins and Simms in a company that owned  the Ventura County acreage, he said. The land, near Moorpark, was once part of  the Strathearn cattle ranch.  </P> <P> In court papers, a lawyer for Simms, the car dealer, said Robbins "brought  Blake into the Moorpark deal to get rid of him in the Marina deal."  </P> <P> Robbins and Simms purchased the Strathearn property in 1985, buying out a  previous owner who paid $300,000 for it. But last year, they filed suit against  each other after the ranch was sold to another firm for about $22 million.  </P> <P> Simms' lawyer said in court papers that Robbins withdrew from the Strathearn  project and agreed to relinquish his share of profits in it in early 1988, when  the state was investigating whether he had improperly benefited by loaning  campaign funds to political and business associates, including Blake.  </P> <P> Robbins was cleared of any wrongdoing in March, 1988, after telling state  investigators that he had no equity interest in the ranchland and therefore  could not have benefited from loans to Blake, his erstwhile partner in the  property.  </P> <P> However, state Assistant Atty. Gen. N. Eugene Hill said his office reopened its  probe after Robbins claimed in a lawsuit he filed against Simms last August  that he still is entitled to some profits from the ranch's sale.  </P> <P> "He alleges an interest that was inconsistent . . . with the statements that  were made to us" during the earlier investigation, Hill said. He said his  office was informed of Robbins' new claim by a lawyer for Simms.  </P> <P> If convicted of having used campaign funds for personal gain, Robbins would be  subject to a fine of twice the amount of the misused money.  </P> <P> Robbins said he should share in the ranch profits because after he withdrew  from the deal in 1988, he lent Simms $1.4 million to help prepare the land for  development.  </P> <P> In court documents, Robbins' lawyer characterized the lawmaker's 1988  withdrawal from the Strathearn deal as a "short-term break" in a four-year  partnership between him and Simms in the land deal.  </P> <P> The lawmaker said he is confident that he will be cleared again of any  improprieties.  </P></p>

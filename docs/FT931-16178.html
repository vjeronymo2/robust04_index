			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Technology: Steering clear of chaos - How British Rail compiles its timetable and how private franchisees will compete for space The government's controversial determination, reaffirmed this week, to press ahead with the privatisation of Britain's rail services opens up exciting opportunities for new train operators, but is also bound to cause practical headaches. One area fraught with potential problems is the timing of train arrivals and departures. Twice a year, British Rail turns to its train service database to produce its national passenger timetable, filling a hefty 1,500 pages. Future franchisees will have to become closely involved in this logistical exercise, likely to become even more complex when they enter the rail scene. Although committed to franchising out passenger services, the government will not abandon the national timetable. Thus operators will have little scope to make their services more attractive than BR's existing trains by obtaining more favourable timetable slots. The main advantages of privatising routes will, as the government sees it, be in improved service and marketing. However, new operators will be involved in the timetable planning process, though timings will be allocated centrally by a new regulatory body. BR employs about 100 planners in six regional groups to draw up its timetable. Their job is to turn a list of competing bids to run services from BR business managers (and, in future, franchisees) into a safe, coherent, integrated service. The timing of every train in the country - there are 16,000 services a day - is worked out individually and interleaved with slower or faster trains that want to use or cross the same track, taking account of engineering works and speed restrictions. One of the busiest regions is handled at Rail House in Crewe, Cheshire. This is the West Coast Mainline, including Intercity services between London and Birmingham, Manchester, Holyhead, Carlisle, Liverpool and Manchester, as well as Intercity Cross country services, local services and freight. In the West Midlands alone, this means juggling the needs of Intercity trains to and from London with the competing demands of Midlands Cross Country Railway, Regional Railways Central, Birmingham's Centro and Railfreight, with the slowest train on the line governing its capacity. The team's main tool is Protim, a system developed by BR computer staff in York. Protim encapsulates BR's train planning rules and is based on personal computers linked in a local area network and connected to the central Train Services Database (TSDB) on a mainframe computer, also at Crewe. The planners also have access to a computer system in Derby which holds data on track geography and speed restrictions and the capabilities of each class of BR locomotive, allowing planners to time any train between two points. The timetable process begins with a bid from Chris Dwyer, West Coast Intercity business manager, and his colleagues for slots, or train paths, to run a set of services. John Whitmore, chief timetable planner at Crewe, needs to know the number of trains for each service, where they will go from and to, and where they will stop. Faced with a barrage of conflicting bids for train paths (the West Coast Mainline consists of a fast up-and-down track and a slow up-and-down track, with few opportunities for overtaking), the timetable planners invariably offer a compromise between the aims of the business manager and the line's capabilities. 'Our aim is to come up with a performance schedule based on a set of rules called Rules of the Plan which are agreed between the operator, train planner and the performance manager who monitors BR's efficiency,' says Whitmore. The Rules of the Plan include such constraints as: Station dwell time - the standard period (now one minute) that trains stop at intermediate stations. Connection allowance - the maximum time needed to get to a connecting train at main interchanges. The approach here is to take the case of, say, an elderly person with bags who cannot use stairs and has to go across a big station. Changing locomotives - some trains will need to change locomotives from electric to diesel; the rules allow 11 minutes. Turnround time - every Intercity train needs a long stop at the terminus while it is cleaned and has reservation tickets attached; 40 minutes is allowed. Engineering recovery time - this is distinct from engineering works and involves a speed restriction applied while new ballast consolidates. In the current timetable, there is an extra allowance of 12 minutes in the London-Glasgow timings for such reduced speeds. BR has a real-time computer system which tells it where each train is and how it is performing against its timetable, providing feedback for timetable planners of any changes needed. Once the planners have a list of the trains BR wants to run and how long each will take on its journey and between all intermediate stages, they still have to fit each service into a timetable, ensuring that timings do not conflict. The main charge levelled by opponents of the franchising plans is that they fail to take account of the complexity of BR's operations. Changes in the timings of trains between London and Manchester can affect services as far away as York and Newcastle.</p>

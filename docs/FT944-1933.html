			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Intercare down 46% Despite turnover 13 per cent ahead, full-year pre-tax profits at Intercare Group, the healthcare product supplier, fell 46 per cent from Pounds 4.31m to Pounds 2.33m. The Pounds 43.4m sales figure for the year to October 31 was up from Pounds 39m last time and included Pounds 976,000 from acquisitions. The group attributed the disappointing outcome to a 'significant contraction' in the Dutch scooter market and poor performance by new ventures in the medical products business. Recovery was expected in both areas. Earnings per share emerged at 5.5p (10.5p). The recommended final dividend is unchanged at 2.8p, maintaining the total for the year at 3.5p.</p>

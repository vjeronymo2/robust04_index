			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Holders shun Lonrho rights issue LONRHO'S rights issue was shunned by most of its shareholders. The offer closed yesterday afternoon. Shares in the international trading group rose 1p to 72p compared with the rights issue price of 85p. Although Lonrho will not announce the results of the issue until Monday, its advisers confirmed that there had been very little take-up by shareholders. The structure was designed to allow Mr Dieter Bock, a German financier who is underwriting half the 200m new shares, to become Lonrho's biggest shareholder. Mr Bock's stake in the enlarged group is expected to be close to 18.8 percent. Charterhouse, which is acting for Lonrho, said it had been important to offer all the group's shareholders the same terms as Mr Bock, regardless of the expected take-up. Other parties have until Tuesday afternoon to bid for the rights rump, which otherwise lapses. However, while there have been several expressions of interest, there have been no firm offers. The German financier will consider whether to join the board next month. If he does take up a directorship it is expected to be as joint chief executive with Mr Tiny Rowland. Many of Lonrho's shareholders, who have been deeply concerned about the unresolved question of the succession, believe Mr Bock will succeed the 75-year-old Mr Rowland. Mr Paul Spicer, Lonrho's deputy chairman, said: 'Mr Rowland has no present intention of retiring for at least three years.' See Lex</p>

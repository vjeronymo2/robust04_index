			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Sedgwick issues Pounds 41.5m bond to help reduce borrowings SEDGWICK, the insurance broker, yesterday announced the issue of a Pounds 41.5m convertible bond. The group said it would use the proceeds for general corporate purposes and reduce debt of some Pounds 200m. Mr Jeremy Pinchin, the company secretary, said markets had responded positively to the issue, much of which had been placed with European investors by lead managers, SG Warburg Securities and NM Rothschild. The bonds will carry a coupon of 7.25 per cent and be paid semi-annually in arrears, with the conversion price set at 190p (15.85 per cent over the price of Sedgwick's ordinary share price at the time of the pricing). Unless previously converted or redeemed, the bonds will be redeemed on May 31, 2008. Sedgwick may redeem the bonds at their principal amount plus accrued interest at any time from December 14, 1998.</p>

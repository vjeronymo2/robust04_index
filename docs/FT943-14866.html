			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of France (15): Une petite crise de confiance - The arts have veered towards cultural conservatism There is a possibly apocryphal story that when Mr Jack Lang, the popular socialist politician, and his wife, Monique, arrived at the gala dinner for this year's Cannes Film Festival they headed straight for their usual seats  -at the table of honour. The hitch was that those seats are reserved for the French arts minister; Jack Lang had been ousted from that post when the socialists lost power in the spring 1992 elections. The best seats at the Cannes gala now belong to his conservative successor, Jacques Toubon, and his wife, Lise. The Toubons  -so runs the story - stood hovering on the sidelines while the festival organisers pleaded with the Langs to move. Apocryphal or not, the story acts as a neat illustration both of Mr Toubon's difficulties in settling into his new job and of the unstable state of the French arts which, like so many other areas of contemporary France, have hit a crisis of confidence. Mr Toubon is in an unenviable position. He has a difficult act to follow in the charismatic Jack Lang who dominated the arts for almost a decade; Francois Mitterrand's longest-serving minister. Mr Lang not only benefited from the president's support but also from good timing. He was in power for much of the prosperous 1980s and secured healthy increases in the culture budget to finance ambitious initiatives such as the grands projets, his modern architectural schemes. His successor has taken over at a more difficult time: the French economy has been in recession and most ministers have been forced to make cuts. To his credit, Mr Toubon has defended the arts budget, which was frozen at FFr13.45bn for 1994. But his tenure has coincided with a turbulent period for France when the country's economic problems have been aggravated by social anxieties such as the rising incidence of Aids and an increase in racial tension. These pressures have taken a toll on the cultural community. Rarely a week goes by without an academic or journalist bemoaning the arid state of the French arts in the media. The cultural life of every country enters a fallow period from time to time, but the issue has a particular poignancy for France, which has prided itself on its artistic and intellectual prowess ever since the 1789 Revolution. Optimists among the French intelligentsia dismiss concerns about the current lull in artistic activity as typical of the Gallic love of self-criticism. But the realists accept that, just as Paris lost its laurels to New York as the international art centre, with the flowering of abstract expressionism in the 1950s, it is now losing its intellectual edge. No new names have surfaced to take the place of the great French thinkers of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s: Michel Foucault, Roland Barthes and Louis Althusser. These problems were already apparent in the 1980s. However, they were disguised by the triumphalist spirit of Jack Lang's policies. The grands projets produced only one world-class French architect: Jean Nouvel, the man behind the Arabic Cultural Centre in Paris. But the excitement of the new buildings created the impression of France as a dynamic architectural centre and fostered the emergence of figures in related fields - such as Philippe Starck, now one of the world's most famous designers. Jack Lang's munificence also stimulated other areas, notably cinema, with the arrival of exciting young film-makers such as Jean-Jacques Beneix with Diva and Luc Besson with Subway. Some of these new talents are now struggling. Jean-Jacques Beneix and Luc Besson have yet to replicate the commercial and critical success of their early work. Jean Nouvel is still creating extraordinary buildings  - notably the Fondation Cartier arts centre which opened in Paris this spring - but his architectural practice has suffered in the recession. The recession has also made it difficult for new names to emerge, not only because budgets are tighter but because the climate is less confident and thus more conservative. Moreover, the French arts have historically fared badly during difficult economic periods, arguably because France, unlike Britain, has no tradition of social-realism. French film critics lionise the work of the British realists, Ken Loach and Mike Leigh, but almost all the important French movies of the 1990s have been historical epics. France's writers and film-makers seem to have little interest in reflecting the harsh reality of contemporary life. Jacques Toubon seems unperturbed by this. His aim is to make the arts more populist by changing the emphasis of his ministry's work away from Jack Lang's multi-cultural modernism, back to a conservative ethos of conservation and patriotism. His main initiatives have been unashamedly nostalgic - notably his ambitious programme to renovate delapidated historic monuments such as the Garnier Opera and Pompidou Centre in Paris. The conservation theme is also apparent in more blatantly nationalistic schemes such as his battle last autumn to defend French cinema against the 'cultural imperialism' of Hollywood during the Gatt negotiations and his new law against the use of English, or franglais, in advertising. Mr Toubon's attacks on Hollywood and franglais have been greeted with derision outside France. But his cultural conservatism has struck a chord with the government's centre-right supporters at a time when they seem to want to escape from the uncertainties of contemporary life by wallowing in the past through the anniversaries of the D-Day landings, the Georges Pompidou presidency and even in the recent trial of Paul Touvier, the Nazi collaborator. However, as Mr Toubon's critics have pointed out, his nostalgia drive is not simply a harmless diversion. It could have the adverse effect of encouraging the French to avoid getting to grips with the problems of the present, thereby prolonging, rather than resolving, the cultural crisis in France.</p>

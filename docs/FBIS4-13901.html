			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Major General Amnon Shahaq, head </F> of the Israeli delegation to the Cairo talks, by Mikha Friedman  and Ge'ula Even on 22 April -- recorded]    [Text] [Friedman] Earlier this morning, we spoke with Major  General Amnon Shahaq, deputy chief of staff and head of the  Israeli delegation to the Cairo talks. In our first question,  we asked Shahaq to comment on Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres'  assertion in Bucharest that when he and PLO Chairman Yasir  'Arafat perused the understandings reached in Cairo, they also  discovered many points of disagreement.    [Shahaq] I assume that at least our foreign minister  discovered nothing new in Bucharest, seeing as we had met before  his departure and Mr. Peres was briefed in advance on all the  points discussed in the negotiations and what we had agreed or  disagreed upon. I can tell you what is happening in Cairo,  however, and I will also take a moment to comment on the  committees. These committees were not established to sit in  Cairo; they have nothing to do in Cairo. These three committees  were not established on a temporary basis. They are all  permanent committees which must operate from Gaza and have  nothing to do with the entrance of any party to the area but  rather must deal with working procedures inside Gaza, as well as  coordination and cooperation between those who will enter Gaza  and the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] troops that will remain  there.    [Friedman] I take this to mean that the committees will be  responsible for translating the understandings in principle  reached in the negotiations into practical developments in the  field?    [Shahaq] Not only that. The committees will also be  responsible for preventing friction and facilitating the best  level of coexistence possible in the field on the basis of the  agreements reached in Cairo.    [Even] Are they supposed to operate until the final signing  of the agreement or until the Palestinian authorities enter the  Gaza Strip and Jericho?    [Shahaq] These committees are part of the understandings  reached in Cairo. The establishment of these committees was  agreed upon in Cairo, and their job mainly begins from the  moment the Palestinians assume authority. Clearly, the  committees will be incapable of operating effectively from the  first day if they are not situated in the area prior to the  transfer of authority in order to familiarize themselves with  the area, with us, and with the joint understandings that were  reached. We will have to work together for a few days before  the Palestinian authority can assume its responsibilities so  that the joint committees, which also feature Israeli  representatives, will have the opportunity to learn how to work  together and cope with problems in the field.    [Friedman] Major General Shahaq, can you give us any new  target date this morning for the signing of the agreement  between Israel and the PLO? Perhaps 5 May, as surmised by an  Israeli television correspondent last night?    [Shahaq] I never had any target dates. According to the  Oslo agreement, there were certain target dates that we intended  to meet but failed. Today, I would rather not mention any  dates, because I simply do not know. If we had a date, I would  not keep it a secret. There is still work to do. I think that  the issues we still have to overcome are neither irresolvable  nor numerous. Therefore, barring the emergence of new obstacles  or the reopening of issues that we consider closed, and if  everything continues the way things went this week -- and I see  no reason for this not to be the case -- the negotiations can be  concluded in not too long a period.    [Even] While you were negotiating with the Palestinians in  Cairo, the families of the Israeli POW's and MIA's demonstrated  and waged a hunger strike. They are demanding a linkage between  information on the fate of their children and their release and  the release of Palestinian security prisoners held by Israel.  Do you accept such a linkage between the two issues?    [Shahaq] I agree that everything must be done on every  possible level to resolve the very painful issue of the POW's  and MIA's.    [Friedman] Does Yasir 'Arafat have information on the POW's  and MIA's that he is not giving us for some reason?    [Shahaq] I cannot say if he has any information. I can  safely assume that Palestinian elements have easier access to  such information, and I believe they must do everything in their  power to not only get this information but also relay it to us.  They must do everything they can to resolve this crucial  problem. I consider it their obligation under the current  circumstances.    [Friedman] Maj. Gen. Shahaq, Israel continues to reject the  Palestinian demand to release Hamas [Islamic Resistance  Movement] prisoners as part of the mass prisoner releases  expected within the framework of the agreement. At the same  time, Israel conducted mass arrests of hundreds of Hamas  activists this week, mainly in the Gaza Strip. What is the  point of these arrests if Israel is pulling out of the area  completely in several weeks?    [Shahaq] One can also ask why Hamas is continuing terrorist  attacks. Israel will continue to fight Hamas as long as it  perpetrates terrorism. I believe that a soldier's body was  discovered only yesterday, after being murdered, to the best of  my knowledge, by Hamas operatives. Israel is at war with Hamas,  and this war will continue for as long as necessary.    [Even] Did your interlocutors in Cairo read the assessments  prepared by the director of the Shin Bet according to which the  Palestinians will start massacring each other as soon as the IDF  pulls out of Gaza?    [Shahaq] I did not hear these assessments. I read about  them in the newspapers, and I am not sure they are correct.    [Friedman] One more question about Israel's agreement with  the PLO: What is the gap between the signing of the agreement  in Cairo and the completion of the IDF's withdrawal from Gaza  and Jericho?    [Shahaq] The interim period between the signing of the  agreement and the transfer of authority to the Palestinians will  take three weeks.    [Friedman] Thank you very much, Maj. Gen. Shahaq.</p>

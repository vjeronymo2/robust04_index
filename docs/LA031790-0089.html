			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ALASKA;  </P> <P> SEQUESTERING OF JURY IN SPILL CASE REJECTED  </P> <P> A defense request to sequester the jury in the Anchorage trial of the captain  of the Exxon Valdez to shield them from publicity of the approaching  anniversary of the nation's worst oil spill was rejected by state Superior  Court Judge Karl Johnstone.  </P> <P> But Johnstone granted the defense what it called a "major victory" in ruling  that Joseph Hazelwood could not be considered guilty of acting recklessly for  attempting to dislodge the grounded tanker from Bligh Reef. The Exxon Valdez on  March 24, 1989, spilled about 11 million gallons of oil into Prince William  Sound, and Hazelwood is charged with reckless endangerment, operating the  tanker while intoxicated, negligent discharge of oil and criminal mischief.  Closing arguments are expected next week.  </P></p>

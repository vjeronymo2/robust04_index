			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The calculated risks associated with managing these wastewaters in surface impoundments are very high. Three constituents are considered to pose a substantial potential hazard to human health and the environment ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , risks exceed 1E&hyph;4). Calculated risks for each of these three compounds are 1E&hyph;4.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three of the constituents that have been projected to pose a risk greater than 1E&hyph;6, namely, acetoacetanilide (AAA), acetoacet- <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> o <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -toluidide (AAOT), and acetoacet- <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> o <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -anisidide (AAOA), are high-volume coupling reactants used in the manufacture of azo pigments. As explained above for K162, these constituents are dominant raw materials in the azo pigment manufacturing industry and generally are present in the wastewater treatment systems at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these sites. As shown in Table II&hyph;5, the risks calculated by these compounds range from 1E&hyph;4 to 1E&hyph;6. As stated for K162, these risks were calculated using metabolic product structural-activity relationships (SAR) for these compounds, an approach which is discussed in detail in Section II.D of this preamble,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and in the Listing Background Document for this proposed rule, which is located in the RCRA Docket for this rulemaking (See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  section).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Table II&hyph;4, presented earlier, shows that AAA and AAOA were detected in all of the wastewater samples collected from facilities that use these reactants. AAOT was found only in one of four wastewater samples, but it was found in all four of the sludge samples collected from facilities using the compound. The Agency believes that the latter compound generally is present in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the wastewater treatment system at facilities that use AAOT as a raw material but that it may be preferentially partitioning to the sludge.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the high risks calculated by the three reactants, AAA, AAOA, and AAOT, the hydrolysis products of these compounds, aniline, 2-aminotoluene, and 2-methoxyaniline, also were detected in the waste at concentrations that pose significant risk ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , risks ranging from 1E&hyph;4 to 4E&hyph;6). Discussions addressing hydrolysis pathways and conditions for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these compounds, and the issue of coeluting compounds associated with the hydrolysis products, were presented earlier in this preamble (see discussion of K162, and Section II.D).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the primary raw materials and breakdown products presented above, the combined 2,4- and 2,6-isomers of dimethylaniline, which also are suspected raw material breakdown products, were detected in this waste at concentrations that pose a very high risk ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , a risk of 1E&hyph;4).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Along with risks associated with the individual constituents found in the waste, the Agency considers the combined risks of constituents that co-exist in the wastestream. In the case of wastewaters generated from the manufacture of azo pigments, all of the reactants and breakdown products previously discussed in this section ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , AAA, AAOT, AAOA, aniline, 2-aminotoluene, and 2-methoxyaniline) are assumed to co-exist in the wastestream. The reactants are used in producing numerous large-volume pigments that are manufactured on a frequent basis. Since this wastewater stream represents several commingled wastestreams from throughout the plant, the constituents are likely to be present simultaneously in the waste. Therefore, the combined risks of these individual constituents, which are projected to be very high under the surface impoundment mismanagment scenario (i.e., 3E&hyph;4 at the high end), also were considered in making this listing determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the calculated risks associated with the plausible management practice for this waste (treatment in surface impoundments), EPA is proposing to list wastewaters from the production of azo pigments as a hazardous waste, designated EPA Hazardous Waste Number K163. However, the Agency recognizes that if wastewater treatment sludges from the production of azo pigments (K162) are listed as proposed, the available options for wastewater management may change and the surface impoundment scenario may not be plausible for the following reason: wastewaters that are managed in an impoundment will generate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sludges through precipitation. In the event that K162 sludges were listed and the wastewaters were not, the sludges generated in a Subtitle D wastewater impoundment would be hazardous wastes and the surface impoundment would become subject to RCRA Subtitle C regulation. The Agency is requesting comment on whether the use of Subtitle D surface impoundments to manage wastewaters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be a plausible management scenario if the wastewaters were not listed but the wastewater treatment sludges were listed as hazardous wastes. The Agency also is requesting comment on the need to list K163 wastewaters, given that the plausibility of the management scenario on which the risk assessment was based may be affected by the final outcome of the K162 sludge listing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons stated above, EPA proposes to add the following constituents to Appendix VII to Part 261_Basis for Listing: Aniline, 2-aminoaniline, 4-aminoaniline, 2-methoxyaniline, 2-aminotoluene, 3-aminotoluene, 4-aminotoluene, acetoacet- <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> o <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -anisidide, acetoacet- <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> o <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -toluidide, acetoacetanilide, 2,4-dimethylaniline, and 2,6-dimethylaniline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, 2-aminoaniline, 4-aminoaniline, 2-methoxyaniline, 3-aminotoluene, acetoacet- <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> o <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -anisidide, acetoacet- <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> o <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -toluidide, acetoacetanilide, 2,4-dimethylaniline, and 2,6-dimethylaniline are proposed to be added to Appendix VIII to Part 261_Hazardous Constituents. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

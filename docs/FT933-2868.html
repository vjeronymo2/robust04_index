			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / International Company News: Amoco wins oil field agreement AMOCO, the US oil group, has secured a preliminary agreement to develop the giant Priobskoye oil field in western Siberia, after a competitive bid with other western companies. The field has reserves of as much as 5bn barrels and could at its peak produce 450,000 barrels a day, making it a field 'of world class', Amoco said. The break-up of the Soviet Union has provided one of the best opportunities for western oil companies to acquire substantial new oil reserves. The agreement gives the US company exclusive rights to negotiate a full production-sharing agreement with the Russian government and the two Russian companies which will jointly develop the field. Amoco said it was likely to take more than 20 years to bring the field up to full production. Its investment in the project will be 'in the billions of dollars,' it added.</p>

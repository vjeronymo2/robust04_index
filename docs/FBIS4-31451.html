			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 9 Jun (MTI) -- The Hungarian Socialist  Party's (MSZP) senior economic expert, Laszlo Bekesi, and the  managing faction leader of the Alliance of Free Democrats  (SZDSZ), Gabor Kuncze, agreed that the preparations for the 1996  World Expo in Budapest must continue, but that all required  financial conditions must be guaranteed. Coalition talks  between the two parties began on Tuesday.    The Expo will be more modest than initially targeted since  the original plan of its financing from business sources has  been aborted, Bekesi said to the daily NEPSZABADSAG.    When the Expo project came into being, the Antall government  did not specify the concessions and ownership rights the  investors would be entitled to. It also failed to specify the  rights of utilisation of the territory and buildings after the  Expo, Bekesi said.    These oversights cannot be repaired now because of the lack  of time before the opening of the Expo. As a consequence, the  Expo, which requires 100-120 billion forints, can be financed  only from budget sources, he said, adding that the 30 billion  forints which has already been allocated by Parliament for the  Expo would not cover the costs of even the most basic  investments. According to Bekesi, the new government will not  revise the plan of the Expo, but due to financial limitations  the Expo will be more modest than was originally conceived.    Kuncze told NEPSZABADSAG that the Expo must be organised if  the deadline can be met and if the event can be financed.    Although the amount allocated by Parliament is not enough,  more than 20 billion forints has already been spent on Expo  preparations over the past three years. Among others, bond  issues and real estate constructions have begun, and 24  countries have officially announced their participation. As a  result, the Expo cannot be cancelled now even if every sign  indicates that it will operate at a loss, Kuncze said.    If the SZDSZ is in a decision-making position, the party  will  recommend modification of the system of implementation and  execution, since present preparations do not meet legal  stipulations, Kuncze added.</p>

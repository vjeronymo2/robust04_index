			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / International Company News: Sorin Biomedica agrees to acquire Pfizer division SORIN Biomedica, the stock market quoted subsidiary of Italy's SNIA-BPD textiles and munitions group, is buying the Shiley artificial organs division of Pfizer, the US drugs group, for Dollars 230m. The deal will be largely financed by a one-for-one rights issue by Sorin Biomedica, which will raise around L218bn (Dollars 178.4m) through the issue of 72.8m new shares, priced at L3,000 each. Sorin Biomedica heads the expanding bio-engineering activities of SNIA-BPD, which is controlled by the Fiat group. Shiley, based in California and with production facilities in Germany and Italy, has around 1,900 employees and expects sales of more than L200bn this year. Most of its products are used in heart surgery. The acquisition will boost Sorin Biomedica's turnover to over L700bn this year, from L444bn in 1991. It will lift the contribution of the bio-engineering division to around 30 per cent of total group sales. Sorin Biomedica has been expanding rapidly in recent years through a number of acquisitions, which have consolidated its position as a leading producer of speciality drugs and high-technology items for surgical and medical uses. Olivetti, the office equipment maker, yesterday signed a letter of accord with the Italian government and trade unions to cut its workforce by 1,500 after a month and a half of negotiations, AP-DJ reports from Milan. The agreement fell far short of Olivetti's initial plans, announced last month, to cut its payroll by 2,200. Olivetti has launched a company-wide restructuring plan in an effort to trim costs and maintain competitiveness despite the slump in the European computer market. Olivetti said last week it expected to post a consolidated 1991 loss of at least L290bn.</p>

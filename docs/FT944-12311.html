			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Management: Talent defects to the private sector - David Goodhart continues a series with a look at the task of overseeing a group of job centres / Public Services Management Margaret Walker runs 12 job centres in south-east London, serving areas with some of the highest and most intractable unemployment in Britain. As a district manager for the Employment Service, she is responsible for about 600 job centre staff and an annual budget of Pounds 13.1m, Pounds 9m of which is spent on manpower. Those 600 are in turn in charge of paying out benefit to more than 50,000 people, policing the rules which claimants must abide by, and trying to return them to the labour market as quickly as possible. Bustling between her different job centres, Walker, 34, seems the very picture of the efficient, compassionate, public-sector manager. She has certainly got results. Her district of the Employment Service (the government agency which runs the job centres) was last month awarded one of the government's Chartermark awards for good service. She has also benefited, winning significant performance bonuses. But such bonuses have only raised her salary to a little over Pounds 30,000 per year, not a large amount by private-sector standards for someone with her responsibilities. And not enough to keep Walker in the public sector. Later this month she takes up a post with the recruitment company NB Selection. 'Private-sector experience will be useful. I envisage returning eventually to the public sector, perhaps to run a big hospital.' But Walker clearly feels there is a glass ceiling preventing people like her rising much further in the civil service. She believes this is more to do with her personality than her sex. She certainly displays an un-civil service directness about the frustrations of the job. 'There are still irritations like the annuality rules on money, which force you to hand back part of anything you save at the end of a year,' she says. Walker also believes promotion opportunities are shrinking as layers of management are cut out. 'When you have a large number of people who entered the department in the 1970s, flat management makes it difficult for the people that came in later,' she adds. The exit of a promising young manager such as Walker illustrates the problem faced by organisations - especially in the public sector - moving from a 'promotion culture' to a performance pay culture. 'In theory the point of such a shift is to make it more attractive to people like Margaret to stay doing something they are good at, such as running job centres, rather than moving them on to things they may be less good at,' says Jeremy Cowper, head of corporate development at the Employment Service. In practice it may be causing promising young managers to flee. Another problem for the public sector is gaining the right balance between local managerial discretion and national rules. An organisation which hands out billions of pounds of public money cannot afford to give local managers too much discretion, but with no discretion at all it becomes impossible to attract talent. Walker has had some freedom - she has, for example, introduced a non-statutory childcare system for single mothers - but most of her job has been about applying national rules. 'We are trying to combine humanity with the spirit of the law,' she says. Walker was recruited from the ranks of the unemployed. After going from a Midlands grammar school to Oxford she failed her bar finals and found herself jobless for a year in 1982. 'Having experienced the system with all its petty humiliations I know how harrowing it can be,' she says. But she insists things have improved since then. There is better integration of job search and benefit receipt under one roof, and a new language of clients rather than claimants. Given a free hand to make one change to the system Walker says she would introduce a third category between formal employment and claimant status. 'I come across a lot of people who are basically unemployable but who still have quite a lot to offer, we need some mechanism for allowing them to receive benefit unconditionally while doing various kinds of unpaid work.' It is not an idea which will find favour with a government trying to toughen the conditions for receiving benefit. But the government is about to become her ex-employer, so Walker does not care.</p>

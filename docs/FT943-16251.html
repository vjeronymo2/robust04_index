			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Vodafone back on line Better than expected new subscriber figures for the second quarter from Vodafone, the leading cellular phones group in the UK, saw the company's shares extend their recent recovery. During the second quarter Vodafone attracted 155,000 net new subscribers to its cellular network. 'These are great numbers; Vodafone has added as many new customers to date as it did in the whole of 1993,' said Mr Mark Lambert, a telecoms specialist at NatWest Securities. The NatWest analyst said the new subscriber figures underpinned increased forecasts for the company's earnings pencilled in following the preliminary figures announced early last month. Vodafone shares, which fell to an 11-month low of 473p only a week ago, moved up a further 10 to 509p on the news, which helped to confirm the group's position as the leading brand name in the UK mobile phones market, in spite of sharply increased competition. This has come from Mercury's One-to-One cellular network, launched last autumn, and a heavy marketing programme for Orange, the new network launched by Hutchison Telecom.</p>

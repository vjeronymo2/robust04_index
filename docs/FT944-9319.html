			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Arts: Today's Television Is it my age or do contestants in University Challenge (8.30pm BBC2) demonstrate a horrible vacuum in what used to be termed general culture? But then we live in an age when what was once called general knowledge is dismissed as trivial pursuits. Neither of the youngsters in Lifeswaps (7pm BBC2) would make the team as they change life styles (bohemian versus libertarian). They're about as interesting as the tabloid hack and Woman's Hour reporter: not much contrast, given Woman's Hours recurrent obsessions. The ex-Sun man's simulated sex for Radio 4 differs little from his calling's usual preoccupations. And the appalling Lily Savage, a relic of 1950s working-men's club naughtiness, should swap lives with a Hebridean crofter forthwith. After a fascinating start this series is spluttering into irrelevance. Who cares if Manchester's trendy clubbers are shocked when their hip DJ is replaced by 'Gatley's mobile disco legend, Norman Tinsel'? The Dying of the Light (8pm ITV) is much more worthwhile, a drama-documentary about the charismatic aid worker shot in Somalia, Sean Devereux.</p>

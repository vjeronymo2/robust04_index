			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / German minister quits over shootout MR Rudolf Seiters, Germany's federal interior minister, yesterday resigned after coming under mounting pressure from the media and politicians for his handling of a shootout between German police and suspected left-wing terrorists. The resignation brings to 20 the number of ministers who have quit Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governments since he came to power in 1982. Six ministers have resigned since the beginning of the year, highlighting the internal problems the centre-right coalition faces as it prepares for re-election next year. The government's public image recently suffered a setback when Mr Theo Waigel, the federal finance minister, announced his willingness to leave the cabinet if he was chosen to replace former Bavarian premier Max Streibl. Mr Seiters and Mr Alexander von Stahl, the federal prosecutor, have been under attack for not disclosing the exact circumstances under which Mr Wolfgang Grams, a suspected member of the Red Army Faction, died last Sunday. Mr Seiters said he was taking personal responsibility for the 'mistakes, the lack of clarity and of co-ordination in the police'. Reports in the German media, based on the accounts of witnesses, allege that police shot Mr Grams at point-blank range when he was on the floor and unarmed. Der Spiegel, the German weekly magazine, quoted a police officer as saying that 'the killing was like an execution'. Earlier in the week the Interior Ministry had said Mr Grams had been shot at from a distance of 1.5 metres. It had called the arrest a model of anti-terrorist action. The German media have also questioned whether Mr Michael Newrzella, an anti-terrorist police officer who died in the shootout, was killed by the suspected terrorist or by a colleague. Mr Gerhard Kohler, vice-president of the federal criminal office, yesterday denied he was killed by police. Mr Seiters, a Christian Democrat, has been in the spotlight recently because of his role in trying to contain violence against foreigners. He was also instrumental in pushing through the legislative amendment which has toughened the country's previously liberal asylum law.</p>

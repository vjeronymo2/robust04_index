			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Herold-Jean Francois] </F>   [Text] Port-au-Prince, 11 Jun (EFE) -- Today, the  organization known as "Capois-La-Mort," which includes  high-ranking extreme right-wing soldiers, demanded strict  measures against foreigners and the closure of the  Port-au-Prince and Cap-Haitiene airports. In addition, they  demanded an end to diplomatic relations with France, Canada,  Venezuela, and the United States and declared the ambassadors of  these countries persona non grata. According to their demands,  no foreign airplanes should be allowed to land at the Haitian  capital or at any other airport.    The demands were listed in a communique issued today. Among  other things, the document asks for border officials to ban the  entry of foreigners crossing the Dominican Republic border. The  document also demands cutting off water, power, and telephone  services to foreign embassies and those "collaborating with the  enemy."    The military group suggests and even demands giving the  French, Canadian, Venezuelan, and U.S. ambassadors 48 hours to  leave Haiti. If they choose to remain in the country, the group  recommends limiting their movements as well as the movements of  other diplomatic representatives, consuls, and members of  international agencies.    They call for ambassadors and other foreign government  officials to be ordered to remain within a 15 km radius of their  official domicile. According to the communique outlining the  special measures, in order for these people to travel outside  the said 15 km perimeter, they must first get approval from the  Ministry of Foreign Relations and the Armed Forces.    "Capois-La-Mort" considers the strict sanctions ordered  against the country and backed by the international community,  as "a declaration of war against the black Republic of Haiti."  The organization urges the government to approve special "war  measures," to enable it to respond to the "foreign aggression."    The written demands presented by "Capois-La-Mort" come while  rumors of a foreign military invasion of Haiti spread.  Observers see the demands as evidence that the military and its  collaborators could take extreme measures.</p>

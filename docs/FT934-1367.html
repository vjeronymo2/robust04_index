			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / ANC takes step towards agreeing to Afrikaner homeland The African National Congress and South Africa's white right-wing groups have reached agreement in principle to establish a 'homeland' for Afrikaners, a significant symbolic concession to rightwing whites who fear black majority rule. The agreement, which has not yet been made public, is due to be signed tomorrow in Johannesburg. It is understood to be hedged with conditions and is only a first step to a firm deal. No agreement appears to have been reached on important questions such as the borders of the proposed homeland, whether blacks living in it would be allowed to vote, and the powers of the homeland government. But the accord has important symbolic value, and illustrates the ANC's commitment to persuading rightwing whites to contest next year's all-race elections. In the agreement, the Afrikaner Volksfront (Afrikaner People's Front), the umbrella group which represents most right-wing Afrikaners, commits itself to participate in the poll if detailed agreement on a homeland is reached early next year. The two sides will now enter intensive talks designed to meet the timetable for detailed agreements in January and February. Difficult negotiations lie ahead over what the term 'volkstaat' (people's state, or homeland) will mean. It is highly unlikely that an independent ethnic state such as Israel could be created for the Afrikaners because there is no substantial area where they are in the majority, and little likelihood that large numbers would move to a newly-created state. Instead, the 'volkstaat' could consist of small areas, sub-regions within the country's provinces, where Afrikaners could exercise some autonomy. Asked to define the degree of autonomy required in a volkstaat, one AVF representative said: 'If emotionally the people feel they are governing themselves, that would be a volkstaat. Language would be a huge thing.' Control over education would also be important. The Swiss cantonal system, studied by a joint ANC-AVF delegation, may be used as a model. But the AVF is not a monolith and hard right groups are holding out for a more powerful ethnic state. The radical leader of the white-supremacist Conservative Party, Mr Ferdi Hartzenberg, is understood to support tomorrow's accord, but reaching detailed agreement with him could prove difficult. Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC leader, has been strongly against demands for an Afrikaner homeland, although he has said significant power could be devolved to Afrikaner areas. 'Sure, we've got a long way to go,' said one AVF official. 'But when we started, it was only a dream.' Negotiators from the government, the ANC and the right-wing Freedom Alliance were to meet this morning in last-ditch attempts to agree on constitutional amendments before the new constitution passes through parliament on Wednesday.</p>

Runzheimer gathered applicable information on taxes by contacting appropriate sources of information in the allowance areas. Runzheimer also drew upon appropriate tax publications, such as the State of Maryland's Sales and Use Tax Laws and Regulations and the Uniform Sales Tax, ``Ordinance Section 69.05,'' of the City/Borough of Juneau.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 3.6&blank;Goods &amp; Services Survey Results  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> In section 2.2 of this report, Runzheimer presented a detailed explanation of the economic model used to analyze the price data. As it applies to Goods &amp; Services, the approach involved comparing the average prices of marketbasket items in each allowance area with those in the Washington, D.C., area. The resulting price ratios were aggregated into subcategory and then category indexes using the expenditure weightings derived from the 1988 CES.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the area of professional services (accountant and legal fees), Runzheimer and OPM noted the existence of a relatively few extreme values that were either exceptionally low or high cost. In situations such as this, statisticians frequently use the median or trim the data in some manner to enhance reliability. Consequently, Runzheimer recommended that the observations be ranked from low to high and that the top and bottom 20% of the observations be ``trimmed'' (i.e. eliminated) from the data before averages or trends were calculated. (Data were not trimmed if there were fewer than five observations.) OPM agreed. These procedures reduce the influence of anomalies and make survey results more stable from one year to the next.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix 4 contains tables showing the ten category indexes, the three weighing patterns, and the three total consumption Goods &amp; Services indexes for each allowance area. The Washington, D.C., area does not require a table because it is, by definition, ``the reference location'' where all category and component indexes equal 100.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> 4. Housing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 4.1&blank;Component Overview  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The Housing component consists of expenses related to owning or renting a dwelling. These include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;mortgage or rent payments,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;utilities,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;real estate taxes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;homeowner's or renter's insurance,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;home maintenance, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;telephone.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At each of the three income levels, Runzheimer measured annual housing costs under the two main housing categories: ownership and rental.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 4.2&blank;Housing Model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.2.1&blank;Expenditure Research  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Section 2.1.2.4 describes how Runzheimer analyzed the 1988 CES to identify the portion of expenses attributable to each of the four components. Runzheimer also used this survey to determine the national average ratio of families who own, as opposed to rent, their residences. Using the expense data from the seven most appropriate income ranges as input into a linear regression analysis, Runzheimer calculated own and rent weights:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 4,L2,i1,s100,12,12,12 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> Own/Rent Weightings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Category <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Income levels <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 2Lower  <!-- PJG 007 0120 intable --> (percent) <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 2Middle  <!-- PJG 007 0120 intable --> (percent) <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 2Upper  <!-- PJG 007 0120 intable --> (percent) <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=4 --> Homeowner* <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 37.10 <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 46.91 <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 62.86 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Renter <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 62.90 <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 53.09 <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 37.14 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=4 --> Totals <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 100.00 <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 100.00 <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 100.00 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0146 intable --> *With mortgage. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

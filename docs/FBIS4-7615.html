			<p>BFN     [Text] Following the return of a delegation of Polish  members of parliament from Moscow, Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy has  given assurances that Russia wants to develop good relations  with Poland:    [Begin Oleksy recording] We were completely conscious of the  purpose of this visit, and we were there to demonstrate that it  is not only possible but also necessary for Poland and for  Russia that our mutual relations be other than perhaps what they  have been hitherto, even though the times then were different.  Now, the times dictate the need for good relations with Russia  for the implementation of Polish interests, and we confirmed in  the course of the visit that Russia wants the same. There are  no matters of dispute, there are no differences of view that  could stand in the way or could be conditions incapable of being  met, so that precisely these good Polish-Russian relations could  come to fruition.    We talked with all of the well-known Russian politicians. We  spoke with left-wing forces and right-wing and centrist ones.  Concerning economic affairs, Russia, just like Poland, sees the  opportunity for significant growth in the dynamics of trade  turnover and of our own new joint economic, capital, financial,  and investment undertakings. This is what Poland needs, this is  what can serve the improvement of the situation in Russia.    We feel that this visit had a deep sense in political,  economic, and state terms. And let no one seek in it something  that was not there; let everyone find in it that which can serve  Poland and Russia in thinking about Europe and its future,  bilateral, and in thinking. [sentence as heard] [end recording]    Bronislaw Geremek, who was a member of the delegation,  evaluates the visit as being very important:    [Begin Geremek recording] This is a visit that ought not to  be measured in terms of what it was possible to achieve because  this was not for executive power or for the signing of  protocols. This was a political visit and, in my view, one of  great significance because the Poles spoke the language of  truth--various political groupings in various ways--but the hard  language of truth. And the Russians replied to us in like  fashion. We know at the moment where the differences of opinion  lie. They relate to the issue of security, and they must relate  to it. They relate to the issue of Polish participation in  NATO, and they must relate to this. But, simultaneously, on the  one side and on the other, there was a certain act of political  will. It is worthwhile, for both Poland and Russia, to build  normal relations. And, first, to start with the economy. There  is business--Polish and Russian--to be done here, and it will  show that there are no aggressive intentions on either side. In  this sense, I judge that this was a successful visit.

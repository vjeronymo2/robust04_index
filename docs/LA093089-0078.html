			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ATWATER CALLS TAX CUT VOTE AN IMPORTANT DAY FOR BUSH PRESIDENCY  </P> <P> Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater on Friday described House passage of  the capital gains tax cut as "the most important political day of the Bush  presidency."  </P> <P> The reason, he said, sitting poolside at a posh Beverly Hills hotel, is that  the vote highlighted a split in the opposition just at a time when Democratic  leaders said it is time to stand up to the President, to stand up for  something.  </P> <P> Atwater spoke to reporters during one of his periodic working visits to  Southern California.  </P> <P> Southern Californians heard a different view Friday from Democrat Bill Clinton,  governor of Arkansas and a possible 1992 challenger to Bush. Speaking over  breakfast with reporters, Clinton said that the House vote on capital gains was  more a matter of self-preservation by congressmen trying to retain their seats.  </P> <P> Sixty-four House Democrats, two-thirds of them Southerners, abandoned Speaker  Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) and supported the President's tax cut on investment  earnings.  </P> <P> Atwater said that was double the Democratic support he had expected. "I think  from a purely political point of view it was the most important political day  of the Bush presidency so far," he added.  </P> <P> Atwater said the Democrats plus the nearly solid bloc of Republicans -- only  one defected from the President -- is "very reminiscent of those coalitions"  that former President Ronald Reagan enjoyed in the early years of his  presidency.  </P> <P> "I'm not naive enough to think that this is a permanent coalition . . . . (But)  the Democratic leadership was hard-core on this. For the President to go and  get 64 votes I think is very encouraging . . . . When you get this many  Democrats on a vote that was this strongly denounced by the party leadership,  that is a good sign for the future. I think it is a potential coalition for the  future," the GOP chairman said.  </P> <P> Clinton said Democrats were suffering from a lack of true national leader who  could pull the party together.  </P> <P> "The Democratic Party in the Congress has become largely an entrepreneurial  enterprise . . . . We haven't won the White House since 1980 and Democratic  members of Congress have become used to having to fend for themselves and to be  responsible for getting themselves elected," he said.  </P> <P> In this light, it is understandable for Democrats to follow the wishes of  constituents back home. In particular, Clinton said, the timber industry was  influential in winning over Democrats in the South with their arguments that a  tax reduction on trees was important for jobs.  </P> <P> "I don't think we can take the fact that a lot of them defected from the party  leadership as evidence the party is dead."  </P> <P> The House vote Thursday of 239 to 190 could hardly have come at a worse time  for Democratic leaders or a better time for Bush. Just this month, influential  national leaders of the Democratic Party, including National Chairman Ron Brown  and New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, had begun sounding the call to end the  party's honeymoon with the Republican President and stand up for the things  Democrats believe in.  </P> <P> sh Cuomo Accuses Democrats  </P> <P> In a fiery speech in Los Angeles earlier this month, Cuomo accused Washington  Democrats of dormancy, timidity and "cordial contentment."  </P> <P> "For myself as a Democrat, respectfully, I think we have given an appropriate  period of deference to the newly victorious President," Cuomo said.  </P> <P> In private meetings over the last couple of weeks, Brown has spoken out just as  forcefully, telling Democrats it was time to start focusing on Bush's  "failures."  </P></p>

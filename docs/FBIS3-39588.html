			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Enrico Marro: "Luigi Abete: Vademecum for the </F> Elections"]    [Text] Rome -- Luigi Abete asked journalists: "Have you  understood anything? I have not." A month and a half from the  general election of 27 March and the situation is more confused  than ever, emphasized the Confindustria [General Confederation  of Italian Industry] chairman. "I have heard many slogans and  read many statements, but people are not talking about  programs." The political forces are thinking solely of  alliances. So what can an association like Confindustria, which  defines itself as being "nongovernmental" and "nonparty," do to  make its own "contribution" to the preelectoral debate? It can  try to force the electoral alignments to reveal their ideas on  the main themes of political and economic debate.    Confindustria tried to do this in December with the  "decalogue," a document listing 10 demands on the parties  concerning taxation, privatization, the market, and  institutional reform, among other things. "However," explained  Abete, "since nobody has replied officially, we had to come up  with the answers ourselves." Thus was born a "vademecum for the  elections," a 40-page document entitled "A Policy For  Development."    Confindustria does not take sides. There is too much  confusion inside the opposing poles, noted its president. Abete  then posed the questions and provided his own answers. He also  touched on the burning issues. Thus, on the question of radio  and television he says: "[state-owned TV company] RAI must be  scaled down and so should Fininvest, in order to promote the  plurality of the managers." He adds, however, that this scaling  down must "begin with the RAI and safeguard the investments made  by private companies over the years."    He asked the progressives, who range from the Democratic  Alliance [AD] to the Communist Renewal and the Democratic Party  of the Left [PDS]: What is your position on working hours and  property tax? The industrialists stress that unemployment has  risen in every country where working hours have been cut.  Confindustria is also opposed to any form of property tax: "It  already exists for companies, households pay it in a thousand  and one different ways, and it is unthinkable to apply it to  treasury bills. From the center-right alignment ([Forza Italia  leader] Berlusconi and [League Secretary] Bossi), Abete asked  for clarification with regard to "economic compatibilities." He  said: "If we want to continue to clean up public finances, then  taxation cannot fall by 1 percent a year, as Professor Antonio  Martino (an economist in Berlusconi's ranks -- CORRIERE DELLA  SERA editor's note) has said." In short, no demagogy. According  to Confindustria, taxes can be cut by one half point a year at  most.    Abete also asked [Italian Popular Party, PRI, Secretary]  Martinazzoli and [Pact for Italy leader] Segni's center group if  they were ready to "complete the electoral reforms."  Confindustria maintains that we must arrive at what is  effectively a bipolar system through a two-round voting system  or the direct election of the prime minister or the president of  the republic. According to Abete, Martinazzoli and Segni cannot  contemplate being the linchpin while possibly retaining the old  conservatism. From the right wing [National Alliance leader]  Fini, Abete asked for guarantees with respect to European  integration and the markets. Finally, he invited people from  all alignments to indicate their candidates for the post of  prime minister before the election.</p>

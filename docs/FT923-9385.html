			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / Walbrook enters liquidation procedure WALBROOK INSURANCE, the insurance and reinsurance company with net liabilities of Pounds 170m, yesterday passed into provisional liquidation on the instructions of the High Court. The liquidation raises the prospect of an unprecedentedly large payout from the Policyholders Protection Board, the UK insurance industry's safety net, which may total more than Dollars 200m (Pounds 104m). Walbrook, which is a subsidiary of London United Investments, the property company which went into administration in 1990, was one of the leading insurers and reinsurers of US liability business on the London market during the 1980s. Mr Justice Harman yesterday approved as joint liquidators Mr Christopher Hughes and Mr Ian Bond of Cork Gully, and Mr Gareth Hughes of Ernst &amp; Young, who will put together a scheme of arrangement under the 1985 Companies Act. His action follows a winding-up petition lodged by Transit Casualty, a Missouri-based insurance company, which went into receivership in 1985, supported by several other large creditors to Walbrook. It comes after a failed attempt by the directors of Walbrook to produce an informal plan of arrangement which would have left them in control of the company and offered large creditors a 40 per cent dividend and a debt-for-equity swap. The directors did not oppose the winding-up petition, and the principal debate in the court yesterday was about a possible conflict of interest over the appointment of one of the liquidators. The decision to create a scheme of arrangement on the court's orders is unusual, and will require approval by 75 per cent of Walbrook's estimated 30,000 creditors at a meeting. Mr Ian Bond from Cork Gully said yesterday that it would be early next year before a scheme would be ready, because the liquidators would need time to analyse new financial information. He said that one element of the scheme would need to be an agreement from the Policyholders Protection Board to contribute for the creditors which it covers. Estimates range from Dollars 200m to Dollars 1bn. Under a recent ruling in the court of appeal, this would include individual policyholders and partnerships for policies written to cover the UK and US.</p>

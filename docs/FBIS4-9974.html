			<p>BFN     [Text] Rio de Janeiro -- Former Governor Leonel Brizola  (PDT) [Democratic Labor Party] has ruled out any possibility of  an alliance with the PT [Workers Party] during the first or  second round of the presidential elections. "An agreement with  the current PT leadership is not viable," said Brizola, adding  that he believes Luis Inacio Lula da Silva's candidacy is being  artificially inflated by the surveys. "No one believes in the 39  percent he is allegedly getting because that is what he obtained  in the 1989 runoff election."    Regarding the possibility of an alliance with other parties,  Brizola -- who yesterday lunched with Minas Gerais Governor  Helio Garcia (PTB) [Brazilian Labor Party] at the Commercial  Association of Rio de Janeiro -- said the only alliance already  signed by the PDT is with the small National Mobilization Party  (PMN). The former governor said a coalition with the PTB is a  "natural" possibility. Regarding speculation that he would meet  with PPR leaders, Brizola said: "Traditional politicians do not  like me because they know I favor change and if I win the race I  would end political chicanery."    Brizola resigned on 2 April to run in this year's elections.  He said he was satisfied with what he did during his term,  adding that no other governor did more. "They may have equaled  me, at best," Brizola said. At the time the PDT governor left  the government, he had the lowest popularity rate for any  governor in the country. He was undecided whether to run for  president or for the Senate. He said: "I am attracted to  participate in the national campaign," adding: "This will be my  last and greatest campaign. I will use all my accumulated  experience."</p>

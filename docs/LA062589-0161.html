"We will be obliged to  shoot, however disagreeable it might be, at whatever aircraft . . . refuses to  obey orders to land for inspection," according to a report published in Granma,  the Communist Party daily. The armed forces also announced that a 47-member  military honor tribunal will convene today in the case of two generals and five  other officers accused of having links with a Colombian cocaine cartel. Last  week, Granma published a report of a drug scandal that led to the arrests of  the seven, including Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa Sanchez, one of Cuba's most decorated  combat veterans.  </P></p>

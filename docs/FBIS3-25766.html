			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Pan Africanist Congress [PAC] supporters should  "sharpen their weapons" because there are bad times ahead,  Azanian People's Liberation Army (Apla) political commissar  Romero Daniels said yesterday. Speaking before a crowd of  10,000 which filled Umtata's Independence Stadium for the  funeral of Apla commander Sabelo Phama, Daniels said attempts to  establish a volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland] amounted to  provocation. Daniels said the "absurd boerestaat" [Boere state]  advocated by General Constand Viljoen could be regarded as  "provocation for the continuation of the war."    "The moratorium on armed struggle declared by the PAC -- and  fully endorsed by Apla -- was not a defeat of the freedom  fighters. We are political fighters giving the masses of Azania  the chance to decide their own form of government. So to Apla  fighters, we say: be ready, be on the alert, sharpen your  weapons for any eventuality by the enemy, be combat-ready. We  are heading for bitter times." [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / OECD reduces forecast for industrial growth THE ORGANISATION for Economic Co-operation and Development has sharply reduced its growth forecast for the industrialised nations this year and painted a bleak picture of high and rising unemployment in Europe over the next 18 months. Largely because the OECD now expects Germany to suffer a serious recession, the Paris-based organisation has revised down its growth forecast for its 24 member nations to 1.2 per cent in 1993 from 1.9 per cent forecast last December. It expects unemployment in the OECD area to rise to nearly 36m next year - a new postwar record - from 35m this year. As a percentage of the OECD labour force, it is forecast to rise from 7.9 last year to 8.5 in 1993 and 8.6 next year. The German economy is now expected to shrink by 1.9 per cent this year with the result that the European members of the OECD will experience a 0.3 per cent fall in output. Six months ago, the OECD expected both Germany and Europe to grow by 1.2 per cent in 1993. The OECD expects the much worse outlook for the German economy to be reflected in sharply higher unemployment. Germany's jobless total is expected to increase to about 4.5m, or 11.4 per cent of the labour force, by the end of next year from 4m or 10.1 per cent this year. Six months ago, the OECD forecast a slight decline in German unemployment to 8.1 per cent of the labour force next year from 8.3 per cent in 1993. The latest OECD forecasts form a gloomy backdrop to the annual meeting of finance, trade and economics ministers from the OECD countries which begins in Paris today. The OECD secretariat has said social cohesion in western industrial countries will be threatened if unemployment persists. Officials are especially concerned that unemployment is falling far more slowly than in previous upturns in those countries such as the US which are recovering. Another problem is that unemployment has affected white collar workers and upper and middle management far more severely in the latest downturn than previously. Europe is a particular problem. The OECD's latest forecast implies that its European member states will have a total of just under 23m jobless by the end of 1994 compared with about 8.25m in the US and 1.7m in Japan. The OECD has made only a slight downward revision to its forecast for US growth. Officials regard the US economy's weak performance in the first quarter as a temporary aberration that should be followed by a gradual recovery in the current quarter. The organisation also believes Japan is close to recovery although it has revised down its expectation of Japanese growth this year to 1 per cent from 2.3 per cent six months ago. Adding to the gloom is the realisation that there is relatively little that governments can do to spur growth and create jobs. There is little scope for more expansionary monetary or fiscal policies, although the OECD believes that countries should try to improve the quality of the public spending programmes to obtain 'more bang for the buck' in terms of growth. Over the next two days, it will urge member countries to reject protectionism and to focus on improving the skills of their workforces to combat unemployment. Trade ministers will meanwhile be engaged in talks on the margins of the OECD meeting in the hope of achieving progress in the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks. Lex, Page 18</p>

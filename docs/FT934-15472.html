			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Airline launches Bristol service AIR BRISTOL, a new airline which hopes to run scheduled services from the British Aerospace airfield at Filton, north Bristol, yesterday said it had started operations although it has not received Civil Aviation Authority licences, Roland Adburgham writes. BAe has contracted Air Bristol to run its daily company flights to Airbus Industrie's plant in Toulouse. The first flight, using a leased BAC Super 1-11 jet, took off yesterday morning. The company described the lack of CAA licences as a 'technical hitch' and it expected to be granted its own licences soon. It added: 'It is our aircraft and our crew but it is still being technically operated by BAe.' British Midland airline is suspending its daily Birmingham to London Heathrow service from next month. The company blamed falling profitability.</p>

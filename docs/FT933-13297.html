			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Chase Manhattan accelerates improvement in credit quality CHASE Manhattan's emergence from the credit problems that have bedevilled it since the late 1980s was confirmed yesterday as it revealed a marked improvement in credit quality during the second quarter. A falling charge for possible credit losses, plus strong foreign exchange and other trading income pushed net income for the period ahead to Dollars 233m, up from Dollars 152m in the same period a year earlier. Earnings per share rose to Dollars 1.20, from Dollars 0.83. Chase, battered by problems on US commercial property lending at the turn of the decade, had moved earlier this year to isolate Dollars 2bn of troubled property loans and to bolster its balance sheet with the sale of Dollars 750m of new equity. Yesterday, the US's sixth biggest bank reported a provision of Dollars 225m against possible credit losses in the second quarter, Dollars 70m lower than a year earlier and down from Dollars 360m in the first quarter. Analysts saw this as a sign of faster-than-expected improvement in credit quality. Credit quality was also reflected in the increase in the proportion of troubled loans covered by loan-loss reserves, to 82 per cent from 67 per cent. Net interest income advanced to Dollars 894m from Dollars 869m in the same period in 1992, and the bank's net interest margin rose from 4.03 per cent to 4.1 per cent. The bank's cost/income ratio, a key measure of efficiency, fell to 62 per cent, down marginally from the first quarter. 'The aggressive action programme we implemented in the second quarter is already beginning to bolster our earnings momentum,' said Mr Tom Labrecque, chairman. Trading in foreign exchange and derivatives, and in lesser-developed country (ldc) markets, pushed non-interest revenues up by Dollars 100m to Dollars 693m year-on-year. Foreign exchange trading made Dollars 85m (up from Dollars 61m), while derivatives trading brought in Dollars 54m and the ldc markets Dollars 35m. Non-interest income was held back, though, by a Dollars 27m fall in consumer banking fees as borrowers moved to refinance mortgage loans. Tier one capital ratio climbed to 7.74 per cent, from 6.1 per cent.</p>

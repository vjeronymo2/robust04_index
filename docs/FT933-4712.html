			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Ex-Soviet republics bow to Moscow over rouble FIVE former Soviet republics yesterday pledged to give up their fiscal and monetary policies as the price for using the Russian rouble as their currency. The agreement - signed by Russia, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Armenia and Belarus, which decided to join despite already having its own currency - marks a retreat, in the face of harsh economic reality, from the republics' declarations of national sovereignty. The accord has still to be endorsed by national parliaments. The republics, pushed to make a decision after Russia invalidated pre-1993 rouble notes in circulation on their territory, are fearful of introducing their own fully-fledged currencies or at least wish to continue receiving gifts of cash until they are ready to go it alone. Mr Boris Fyodorov, the Russian finance minister, said the deal allowed the retention of a common trading area for producers who could not compete on western markets. He added a transitional period would show which republics were genuinely keen to build an economic union and which were simply there for short-term benefits. The accord sets a transitional period of several months during which it will be up to the five republics to adjust their economic legislation to Russia's and conclude bilateral agreements with Moscow, abiding by its monetary and fiscal targets. In the meantime republics will use their own surrogate currencies or receive new rouble banknotes with special markings preventing them being used inside Russia. Although the rouble zone agreement is designed to prevent republics from exporting inflation to Russia, political considerations are likely to impede Moscow's ability to enforce its rules. Uzbekistan, for instance, has already received a gift of Rbs50bn of new Russian rouble banknotes in a decision which Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister for foreign economic relations, yesterday described as illegal. Mr Boris Fyodorov, deputy prime minister and finance minister, said yesterday Russia was not relying on any new foreign finance before the end of the year. His announcement follows indications that the IMF will not be disbursing new credits Russia had hoped to receive this autumn.</p>

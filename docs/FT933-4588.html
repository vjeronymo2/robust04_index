			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: AAF shares tumble after heavy loss from Blackburn business SHARES in AAF Industries fell 51p to 77p as the modular buildings and alloy wheels group announced that 'a very large loss' had been incurred in the first half in its Blackburn system building business. There would also be very large exceptional and non-recurring items as a result of the closure of the Blackburn operations and their transfer to Brandesburton in Yorkshire. The results for the six months to June 30 were now expected to be delayed until October. The shares recovered 5p to close at 82p. On July 7, AAF issued a profits warning for the six months to June 30. This also related to the Blackburn business and prompted a 66p share price plunge to 125p. Only two months previously the group had made a Pounds 7.65m rights issue, which diluted the stake of W&amp;A Investment Corporation, the South African consumer and industrial group, to 43.1 per cent. Mr Alex Brown became chief operating officer of AAF at the time of the July warning and he said the decision to close Blackburn was instigated by him. As a result of the current difficulties in Blackburn, AAF needed additional working capital. W&amp;A has guaranteed the provision of a Pounds 5.1m loan facility to AAF. This has been fully drawn. Further, W&amp;A will provide an unsecured loan facility of Pounds 4m. Mr Jeffrey Liebesman, W&amp;A joint executive chairman and AAF non-executive chairman, said W&amp;A was in no hurry to have the loan repaid. 'We are acting as a white knight,' he said.</p>

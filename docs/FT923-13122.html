			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / UK faces 25% cut in rebate THE European Commission will today suggest a 25 per cent cut in real terms in the valuable rebate the UK receives on its contributions to the EC budget. This is assuming its own plans for a nearly one- third increase in EC revenue under the Delors II budget proposal go ahead. According to a document the Commission is to examine today, Brussels is suggesting a cut in Britain's rebate from this year's level of 5 per cent of the EC budget of Ecu66.6bn (Pounds 47bn) to 3.8 per cent in 1997. The document notes, however, that a change in EC financing under Delors II and bigger farm support payments under the Common Agricultural Policy reforms would leave Britain's net financial position relatively unchanged. Nevertheless, any sign of Commission tampering with the rebate, which the UK won after an epic EC battle waged by former prime minister Baroness Thatcher, is bound to stir political controversy among the Tory Euro-sceptics. And it could set the scene for fierce debate between the UK and its partners. Germany, the EC's main paymaster which is baulking both at the Commission's revenue plans, and at the UK rebate, is certain to argue for a bigger cut in the rebate. The document says the rebate has 'on average exceeded significantly what was expected when the new system was put in place in 1988', under the 'Delors I' package which runs out at the end of this year. For 1991, for example, the 1988 forecast was Ecu2.4bn and the outcome was Ecu3.5bn. The document says the system is 'extremely lacking in transparency,' seemingly referring to resentment by Britain's partners. The UK won the rebate in 1984. The mechanism refunds to the UK two-thirds of the gap between what it pays in and gets out of the EC budget, and has returned a total of Pounds 12.5bn since 1985. The British government has insisted it will veto any change in the rebate system, and yesterday officials said its concern was to preserve the mechanism used to calculate the refund. The Commission believes its plans would give back the Ecu1bn cut in the rebate through extra spending in the UK, which would bring down the refunded amount anyway. This is because the Delors II package would raise less revenue from VAT and more from relative GNP, favouring the UK by an extra Ecu370m. There would also be Ecu1.3bn more farm spending in the UK under already agreed reforms to the CAP. The UK's small share of EC farm spending relative to its contributions was one of the main original justifications for the rebate.</p>

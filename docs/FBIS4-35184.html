			<p>BFN     [Text] Damascus, 29 May (SANA) -- The newspaper AL-BA'TH  has called on the international community to take a firm and  quick position on Israel's continued attacks and piracy against  Lebanese territory.    In a commentary today, the paper adds that these attacks  pose  grave threats to the region in general and to the Middle East  peace process in particular. Israel's impudence and arrogance  are the result of the direct political support provided by the  United States at the Security Council, the paper notes.    AL-BA'TH rejects the feeble justifications made by  Washington  and other states supporting Israel at the Security Council to  explain their positions on the Israeli crimes. The paper says  these justifications try to hold the national resistance  responsible for Israeli practices. It emphasizes that  resistance is a legitimate and sacred right for anyone subjected  to aggression and injustice.    Concluding, the paper says: The deteriorating situation in  southern Lebanon is an alarm that requires a swift international  move to save both southern Lebanon and the peace process, which  is facing a difficult impasse.</p>

			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Clarke likely to continue widening 20% tax band In recent years Conservative chancellors have established a pattern of measures for personal taxation, many of which are expected to continue after the Budget later this month. The 20 per cent lower rate of income tax, introduced in the March 1992 Budget, has been gradually extended from the first Pounds 2,000 of income to Pounds 3,000. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is expected to continue widening the band - if he is feeling generous it may advance by more than the Pounds 500 in the past two budgets. Some allowances and reliefs have been left to wither and are not expected to be revived. These include the married couple's allowance, frozen for many years at Pounds 1,720 for those under 65 and further weakened by its restriction to tax relief at 20 per cent this year and to 15 per cent from April next year. The allowance has been increased for those over the age of 65 and it remains to be seen whether the chancellor regards this as an anomaly worth tackling. Mortgage interest relief is also expected to continue to be restricted, unless the chancellor is persuaded that it would deal too heavy a blow to a lacklustre housing market - or seeks to balance it with a sweetener. A thaw is expected for personal allowances, frozen since 1992. Mr Richard Law, tax partner at accountants Ernst &amp; Young, said: 'There is a belief that some of the real pressure is off the chancellor, giving him scope to deliver a positive message by increasing allowances.' The threshold for capital gains tax and inheritance tax, unchanged in the last Budget, may be increased this time. Accountants Price Waterhouse believe Mr Clarke may declare 'cashback' offers on mortgages and cars exempt from capital gains tax - a small but populist measure. If he is feeling bold he could decide to simplify capital gains tax with measures ranging from abolishing indexation to eliminating the tax altogether. Other expected measures are details on closing National Insurance contribution loopholes, to which Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, alluded last month, and greater movement towards self-assessment of personal tax.</p>

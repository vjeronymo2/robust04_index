Last Friday, the Rwandan Government brought a lot of  arms and ammunition into the country. The UN Mission to Rwanda  [UNAMIR] is said to have known this and is still waiting for an  explanation--which is not forthcoming. [passage omitted].    Currently, there is also a plan being carried out against  UNAMIR using radio RTLM [an FM radio station broadcasting in the  Kigali area]. It is reported that these same messages are being  repeated by Kigali Radiodiffusion Nationale de la Republique  Rwandaise. Their plan is to use terrorism to make the work of  UNAMIR difficult.    As we said before, the Rwandan Government is said to have  brought in arms last Friday. UNAMIR learned about this and is  still waiting for an explanation. The Defense Ministry itself  accepts the fact that it brought arms into the country, contrary  to the peace agreements, and Rwandans cannot tolerate those who  want jeopardize these agreements.    Meanwhile, the U.S. organization Human Rights Watch has  recently expressed its concern and has asked the international  community and all international organizations to stand up and  stop anything that might bring about a resumption in hostilities  between the armies of both parties. All this, as you have just  heard, is because of provocations carried out by the Rwandan  Government by bringing arms, ammunition, and other military  equipment into the country, clearly bringing to light a plan to  cause a war in the country.

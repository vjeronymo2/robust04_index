			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Heads in the sand: The UK's Conservatives should be concentrating on Europe Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secre-tary, sometimes claims that Britain is 'winning the argument' with its European partners over the future shape of the European Union. It is not entirely clear how he reaches this conclusion. What is clear is that most of the other broadly based Conservative parties in Europe have signed up to a manifesto for this year's elections to the European Parliament which is at odds with the beliefs of the UK Conservative government. Europe's Christian Democrats have issued a manifesto explicitly calling for a federal Europe, including a single currency and a European constitution. But even before it was published, Mr Hurd was busy assuring UK Conservatives that their manifesto would be totally different, totally British and totally non-federal. This beautifully British manifesto is slow to appear. Not merely do the UK Conservatives not agree with those who ought to be their natural partners across the Channel, they do not agree with each other: it is not easy to draft a text which straddles the deep gulf between the Europhobes and the relative Europhiles. Inside sources say the compromise version will be virtually devoid of content, because the party cannot agree a positive policy position on Europe. One can see the Conservatives' problem. They were bruised by the interminable struggle over the ratification of the Maastricht treaty, and they are in no hurry to grapple in public with those controversial issues once more. And since they cannot fight the European Parliament election campaign on an enthusiastically pro-European platform, they will try to fight it on an enthusiastically anti-Socialist platform. 'We must avoid a debate about 'Europe - right or wrong',' says a party intellectual. 'Therefore, we must engineer a debate about 'Europe - right or left'.' This will be a difficult trick to turn: the campaign is more likely to turn on the unpopularity of the government at home than on any European issues. But even if it succeeds, it might not be to the advantage of the Conservatives. The paradox is that Europe's Socialist parties once fiercely combated European integration as a big business ramp. But they have come round to thinking it may have something for them after all, in the form of quasi-Socialist palliatives, such as the Social Chapter of the Maastricht treaty, or a strengthening of democracy at the European level. Most British Conservatives, by contrast, seem to have a deep aversion to the Europe that is emerging, and are consequently unable to come up with a creative approach to the opportunities it offers. This is a great pity. Not because any great European issues will be decided by this year's election campaign to the European Parliament, but because history is thundering down on us, and the Conservatives will not be able to deal with it by averting their eyes. They want to forget all about the Maastricht treaty, and pull the bedclothes over their ears. But in the 1996 review conference, which is less than two years away, they will have to face all the Maastricht issues once more, and by then the stakes will be much higher. Take the plan for economic and monetary union. Mr John Major, UK prime minister, says it is as illusory as a rain dance. But by the 1996 review conference, it will be clear that a large central core of the Union is still determined to go for a single currency; and it will not be deterred by the reluctance of the also-rans. What will the Conservatives say then? They do not know; they merely hope it cannot happen; but that's not a policy. Or consider the Maastricht project for a common foreign and security policy for Europe. The UK's Conservatives want to put brakes on it, in the belief that they can hang on to the old familiar ingredients of British foreign policy: national independence, the alliance with the US, and the integrated Nato organisation. Unfortunately, the world is not like that any longer. In the US this week, Mr Major has been trying to resurrect the 'special relationship', and President Bill Clinton has humoured him with some friendly TV exposure and an overnight stay in the White House. But recent events belie these flattering gestures. When the US president gave a temporary visa to Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, it was not to advance the peace process in Northern Ireland; it was to advance domestic support for his healthcare programme in the US. Mr Clinton does not care about a 400-year-old colonial conflict in Ireland; why should he? Or take Bosnia. After the mortar attack on the Sarajevo market, the US president virtually threatened a diminution of US support for Europe's defence if Britain did not agree to the new policy of bombing the Serbs. Since the US has hitherto done its best to keep well away from any engagement in the Bosnia conflict, and shows no sign of being prepared to get more deeply engaged in the future, his warning can only be taken as a disturbing indicator of the depth of his administration's commitment to Europe. This might not matter if we could look ahead to a long era of peace and sunlit security. In fact, events in Russia and some of its neighbours make it much more likely that we are facing a period of profound instability, and possibly danger. If President Clinton prefers to lead the western alliance from behind, in the case of a localised civil war in Bosnia, what will be his attitude in the event of bigger disturbances further east? We may not know the answer to that question. But a prudent politician would surely be looking for an insurance strategy in Europe, not begging for reassurance in a fading 'special relationship'.</p>

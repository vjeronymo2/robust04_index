			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Bail for Virani set at Pounds 1.25m by magistrates MR NAZMU VIRANI, former chairman and chief executive of the property and pubs group Control Securities, who is charged with fraud in connection with the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International, was freed on Pounds 1.25m bail yesterday. Mr Virani, who is accused of a false-accounting conspiracy, had been in custody since being refused bail on his first court appearance on March 30. Yesterday he was remanded on conditional bail until July 7. Magistrates at City of London courts refused to accept Mr Virani's two sisters-in-law as sureties for Pounds 500,000 each after hearing that their only assets were their homes. Mr Anthony Scrivener QC, for Mr Virani, protested, saying the police and the Serious Fraud Office had agreed that Mrs Aneeta Virani, whose London house is valued at Pounds 750,000, and Mrs Aisha Virani, who owns a house in London worth Pounds 575,000 were acceptable as sureties. The magistrates said they would accept the two women's husbands as sureties for Pounds 500,000 each. They were Mr Alnasir Virani, managing director of the property side of Control Securities, and his brother Mr Zulfikar Virani, managing director of Control's leisure company. Each said his annual income was Pounds 225,000. The court accepted a third surety of Pounds 250,000 from Mr Narinder Singh Chadha, a Manchester businessman. Other bail conditions require Mr Virani to report to Rochester Row police station twice a week and to live at his home in Putney, south-west London. Mr Scrivener, who applied successfully for reporting restrictions to be lifted, said the magistrates' refusal to accept the two women as sureties was 'an injustice and tantamount to refusal of bail'. He said the SFO, which had opposed bail at the earlier hearing, had withdrawn its opposition. Mr Scrivener said Mr Nazmu Virani was a man of good character who had been Asian Businessman of the Year in 1990. 'He pleads not guilty. It is not alleged he has taken any money.'</p>

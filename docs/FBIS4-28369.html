			<p>BFN     [Text] Medan, Jun 2 (ANTARA) -- Three ministers of the  Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand growth triangle (IMT-GT) cooperation  project have agreed to continue their fourth talks in Penang,  Malaysia tentatively scheduled on September 28, 1994.    This was disclosed to the press by Coordinating Minister for  Industry and Trade Hartarto in Medan Thursday following the  conclusion of the third IMT-GT Ministerial Meeting which  produced 11 memorandums of understanding on cooperation between  the business companies of the three countries.    At the Penang meeting the three governments are expected to  agree to further their talks on several matters relating to the  improvement of investment and trade climate for an earlier  realisation of the IMT-GT cooperation scheme, he said.    Minister Hartarto at the press conference attended by dozens  of local and foreign news reporters, was flanked by the Perlis  [Chief] Minister (Malaysia) Dr. Abdul Hamid Pawanteh and  Thailand's Deputy Premier for Economic Affairs Dr. Supachai  Phanitchaphak.    Hartarto said the three nations also agreed to continue  their  deliberations on the joint uniformity concept on the granting of  various facilities to support businesses within the growth  triangle.    The joint uniformity concept on the creation of a favourable  business atmosphere covers uniformity in tariffs to be shared on  the flow of goods, immigration, customs and excise, insurance,  special passports and fiscal matters.    Sharing various views with Minister Hartarto, both Perlis  Minister Dr. Abdul Hamid Pawanteh and Thailand's Deputy Premier  Dr. Supachai Phanitchapak once again stressed the commitment of  the three governments to fully support the realisation of the  cooperation project.    In the meantime, Pawanteh reminded the need for the three  governments to give an assurance on the definition of a number  of terms in the IMT-GT cooperation scheme, such as free trade  zone and border development region, to make it easier for the  Asian Development Bank to conduct a feasibility study scheduled  for completion in July.    The meeting of the businessmen and the ministerial  conference  held since May 31, have produced 11 memorandums of understanding  (MOUs), which were signed in the presence of the Industry and  Trade Ministers of the three countries, and also covered the  construction of an international standard hospital in Medan.    The other 10 areas of cooperation included the development  of  television broadcasting facilities, electric power generation,  meat import, fishery, the import and export of used aluminum and  iron, the export and import of batik cloth, coal exploration,  trade, and the construction of sea transport network.</p>

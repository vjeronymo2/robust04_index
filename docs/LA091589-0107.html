			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL MEETINGS;  </P> <P> 1992 ALL-STAR GAME AWARDED TO SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> The 1992 All-Star game will be played at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium,  National League President Bill White said Thursday after a meeting of  baseball's executive council in Milwaukee.  </P> <P> San Diego, which last played host to the All-Star game in 1978, beat out  Houston, Montreal and Philadelphia.  </P> <P> San Diego business and community leaders made a presentation last June in  Kansas City, Mo.  </P> <P> "We owe a real vote of thanks to the city and community officials who joined  with us in putting together an outstanding bid," Padre president Dick Freeman  said. "We were in tough competition."  </P> <P> In other action, owners unanimously approved the sale of the Seattle Mariners  to a group of investors headed by Indianapolis businessmen Jeff Smulyan and  Michael Browning, who promised not to move the team.  </P> <P> Smulyan and Browning purchased the Mariners from George Argyros, who bought the  team in 1981 for $13.1 million. The team was appraised at $76.1 million in  June.  </P> <P> Newly elected Commissioner Fay Vincent said baseball had the assurances of  Smulyan and Browning that they would not move the Mariners out of Seattle,  which already has lost one baseball team. The former Seattle Pilots played the  1969 season in Seattle before moving to Milwaukee and becoming the Brewers.  </P> <P> "There is no question these two fellows love baseball and they made the  commitment to me they will do everything in their considerable power to make  Seattle a more successful franchise," Vincent said.  </P> <P> Smulyan, 42, is head of Emmis Broadcasting Corp., the largest privately owned  radio station chain in the country. Browning, 41, is president of Browning  Investments, a real estate company.  </P> <P> Upon leaving Thursday's meeting, Argyros declined comment. He was not popular  in Seattle and often battled local officials over his lease and the Mariners'  lack of success.  </P> <P> A. Bartlett Giamatti will be honored by baseball on Oct. 31 at a memorial in  New York's Carnegie Hall, and the World Series will be played in his memory.  </P> <P> Giamatti, who died of a heart attack Sept. 1 after five months as commissioner,  had a private funeral at the request of his family.  </P> <P> Commissioner Fay Vincent said the service in the 2,800-seat hall would be by  invitation only.  </P> <P> Vincent spoke of his predecessor Thursday during the major league owners'  quarterly meeting.  </P> <P> "I started the meeting, obviously, with a tribute to Bart," Vincent said. "I  had written an essay about him and read the essay. I reminded the ownership  that it was our judgment that the World Series should be dedicated to Bart. We  obviously will be using the ball that has his signature. The players will be  wearing black armbands. The umpires will wear suitable patches. The flags will  fly at half staff. The World Series program will be dedicated to Bart and we  will reprint in there that wonderful essay 'Green Fields of the Mind.' "  </P> <P> Former Brooklyn Dodger pitcher Joe Black was appointed special consultant to  the commissioner for player personal development. Black will help players  adjust to their retirements, among other things.  </P> <P> "It's important to make players aware that baseball is only one phase of their  lives," Black said. "I hope I can make a difference by helping players prepare  for long, productive and decent lives once their playing careers are  concluded."  </P> <P> Black, the 1952 National League rookie of the year, recently retired as senior  vice president for urban affairs of Greyhound Corp. and is president of JayBee  &amp; Associates in Phoenix.  </P> <P> Brewer owner Bud Selig was presented the August A. Busch Jr. Award for long and  meritorious service to baseball.  </P> <P> The award was presented previously to Walter O'Malley of the Dodgers, John  Galbreath of the Pirates, John Fetzer of the Tigers, and Lee MacPhail of the  American League and Chub Feeney of the National League.  </P></p>

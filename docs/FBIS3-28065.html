This  was revealed by RAM/SFP/YOU spokesman General Edgardo Abenina.  Abenina said that the continued detention of its members is a  violation of the agreement made between his group and the  government last 22 December 1992. The agreement states that all  members of RAM/SFP/YOU will be freed temporarily while their  cases are still being heard. Abenina, however, expressed hope  that the government is sincere in its peace initiative. Abenina  added that the government is not clear on the procedures it is  implementing for the peace talks.</p>

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Shareholders jib at rewards for BP bosses: Spokesman claims share option plan violates Cadbury code Weak crude oil prices are the usual cause of oil company directors squirming in their seats. Yesterday it was the turn of British Petroleum shareholders to provide the irritation when they challenged the BP board over executive remuneration. The most contentious issue at yesterday's annual meeting, at the Barbican in London, centred on a resolution to extend a 10-year-old share option scheme for middle-ranking BP managers. Many shareholders saw the issue as a rallying point for opposition to extensive executive incentive schemes at a time when BP's dividend is frozen. There was never any doubt that Lord Ashburton, BP chairman, would overcome a steady stream of sniping from the floor. He did, after all, have more than a billion proxy votes in favour of the resolution. But the merits of the resolution were soon swamped by broader expressions of shareholder concern over other incentive schemes, including one covering BP's top 80 managers. Detailed questioning by a member of the UK Shareholders Association took its toll. Lord Ashburton conceded that the draft share option scheme had 'technical shortcomings'. He also agreed that a review of the plan by the Association of British Insurers had criticised it for a lack of specific performance criteria. To frequent bursts of applause from the audience, the shareholders' association spokesman claimed the plan violated the Cadbury code on corporate governance, because it failed to provide 'a full and clear statement of the directors' criteria on which performance would be measured'. He also argued that the directors on BP's compensation committee were not sufficiently independent to oversee the scheme. Other shareholders expressed concern at the total number of shares - more than 84m - on offer through the employee schemes. Lord Ashburton's counter-attack stressed the importance of incentive schemes as part of executive salary packages. He said base salary accounted for only 50 per cent of the total remuneration of BP's top executives, with bonuses and share schemes accounting for the rest. He explained that bonuses paid to executives last year were 'materially higher than those paid the year before because the company's results were materially higher'. As for the dividend, it would be raised as soon as 'trading conditions . . . and prudence' made it possible.</p>

Serra and MacLaren on 28 February reviewed some aspects of  NAFTA implementation and prepared the trade agenda for the  Mexican-Canadian meeting that will take place today.    In a brief interview following the meeting, Serra said the  Mexican Government's position remains "as it has always been,"  one of granting other nations access to NAFTA.    Minister MacLaren, who agreed with Serra, added that the  objective is to ensure that the NAFTA area is open, not a  "closed fortress."    Serra and MacLaren met behind closed doors and gave only  brief answers to reporters' questions. The two also announced  that ExpoCanada will be held on 23 and 24 March.    Serra said this was a meeting "between friends" and that he  hopes he will soon be able to return MacLaren's visits.    Today the two officials will discuss trade and investment,  promotion of businesses, cooperation, statistics, intellectual  property, and multilateral relations.    Official figures reveal that trade between Mexico and Canada  has been small-scale with slight growth in 1994.    Mexico has had a virtually permanent trade deficit with  Canada. As of 1993, however, Mexico has became Canada's largest  commercial partner and constitutes Canada's sixth largest  supplier.    In 1993 Mexico sold Canada goods worth 5 million Canadian  dollars, almost twice as much as the amount traded three years  ago. In addition, Canadian investment in Mexico is some $700  million, almost twice as much as the investment figure for 1989.    Leading Canadian imports include assembly material for  vehicles, wheat, radio and telegraphic equipment, iron and steel  sheets, and iron and steel bars and ingots.    The main products Mexico exports to Canada include passenger  vehicles, crude, spare parts and engines for vehicles, and  data-processing machines, among other things.    Trade prospects are expected to increase between the two  nations. Since the end of 1993, some 6,500 Mexican companies  have visited the Canadian Embassy trade section seeking to do  business with that country. Sectors that have expressed the  greatest commercial interest include those dealing with  transportation equipment, food, and traditional areas such as  paper pulp manufacturing and telecommunications.    Meanwhile, Canadians have expressed a great interest in such  the chemical and mining industries. There are 70 Canadian  mining companies in Mexico with the number increasing all the  time.</p>

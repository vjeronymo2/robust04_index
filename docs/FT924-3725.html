			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Finance and the Family (Briefcase): Double tax MY WIFE and I live on a yacht and sailed from the UK in 1990 when I retired at age 64. We have been accepted as temporary residents of Cyprus, our cruising base, and are considering applying to pay tax there. We still have two properties in the UK which are rented out. Can we pay any tax due on income in Cyprus under the double taxation agreement it has with the UK? Under article 7 of the Cyrpus-UK double taxation convention, the UK has the right to levy full income tax on your rental income. Becoming fully liable for tax in Cyprus will not, therefore, reduce your UK tax bills. Under article 24(2), you are entitled to relief from Cyprus tax on account of the tax payable in the UK on income taxable in both countries. Ask your UK tax office for the free booklet IR20 (residents and non-residents - liability to tax in the United Kingdom). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

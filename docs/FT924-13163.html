			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Cumbria (1): Local agony, national issue - Cumbria's economy has been cushioned by defence spending and the nuclear industry, but the good times have suddenly come to an end. A struggle to create new industries and more jobs has just begun THESE ARE worrying times for Cumbria, the English county known best for the Lake District. It is remote from much of England, and even more so from the rest of Europe, but cannot be ignored, for national issues are involved. It is not just the recession, that has wiped out around 2,000 jobs, but the additional impact of two large doses of structural unemployment, which have already resulted in the loss of many thousands more. Cumbria is undergoing a traumatic change affecting two pillars of its economic structure - warship building and nuclear fuels. Each has created a fund of high technology talent and skills. The fear is many of these will go to waste if they cannot be redirected. The first dose of unemployment was expected: British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL) has spent most of the past 10 years building Thorp, its controversial Pounds 2.8bn thermal oxide reprocessing plant at Sellafield. It is nearly complete, and at least 6,000 construction jobs are coming to an end. The community started getting ready for this in 1988, with BNFL putting in the bulk of Pounds 1.15m a year of funding, in partnership with local authorities, to try and help rebuild the local jobs market. A science park has just opened as part of the process, but against a tide of recession, there is little prospect of quick success. Coping with this trauma would have been hard enough, but the end of the Cold War has limited the market for warships. Once VSEL, the former Vickers shipyard at Barrow-in-Furness, has finished the four nuclear submarines needed for the Trident missile system, there will be no more such regular orders from government. More than 6,500 VSEL jobs have already gone and another 3,000 will eventually reduce the workforce to 5,000. Prospects of doing better have been dashed by the recession, which has prevented the company breaking seriously into a depressed offshore market. It is against this background that Cumbria is pressing the government to grant development area status to Barrow, Whitehaven and Workington, and the hinterlands from which they draw their labour. Local unemployment rates of up to 17.7 per cent are forecast for next year. Even intermediate status would be welcome, not only for the discretionary government grants it would unlock, but because of the access it would give to a wider range of European Commission funds. The government's dilemma is that, increasingly, more areas are pressing for such special help as recession bites, while the public purse-strings have been drawn tighter by the latest economic crisis. Cumbria, however, has suffered two other big rounds of structural unemployment in the last 10 years, with the closure of the Workington ironworks in 1982, followed by deep coalmining, centred on Whitehaven, three years later. The experience helps explain the impressive way in which people are approaching their latest difficulties. Given positive thinking and the right partnership between all involved, things can be turned round: Workington's unemployment rate fell from 23 per cent in 1982 to 8.6 per cent in 1990. Of course, development area status and an enterprise zone also helped. Although recession has cut the net gain in jobs in the steel and coal closure areas from 4,000 to 1,000 - and the Sellafield redundancies will push the figure into net loss - no one is whingeing. Indeed, Cumbria is on the reprise, renewing the attack, trying to accentuate its assets. There are many, including the Lake District - although tourism planners are also trying to promote the aptly-named Eden area and its unspoiled Pennines of east Cumbria to ease pressure on the more popular lakes and fells. Moreover, old market centres such as Kendal, Penrith and Carlisle are relatively well off because they are in the north-south M6 corridor. Indeed, it is the comparative remoteness of Workington, Whitehaven and Barrow that is one of the problems no amount of 'talking up' can counter. Not that this has stopped the newly-launched Cumbria Marketing Initiative from trying. It asserts in its flagship brochure that Cumbria is accessible no matter where you are or want to get to. 'Good communications by rail, road and sea make it easy to get into and get out of, both for people and goods,' it claims. The initiative, chaired by the energetic Mr John Hancock of the highly successful Sealy bed manufacturer, is unanimously backed by public and private sectors and the various job- creation agencies, yet these same people and bodies are also campaigning for better roads. 'The Way Ahead,' a lobbying document they jointly produced last year, warns: 'The survival and development of West Cumbria is drastically threatened by its totally inadequate, poor quality, transport network. West Cumbria as an industrial region will not survive without urgent drastic action.' Councillors and business leaders will be arguing their case again next month with Mr Kenneth Carlisle, the roads minister. Top priority is seen as the dualling of the A595/A66 route from Sellafield to Scotch Corner - the A66's junction with the A1 route to Britain's east coast ports - and of the whole A590 from Barrow to the M6. At present, these routes are undergoing only piecemeal improvements, although the Department of Transport's Transpennine strategy report, published last month, has at least raised hopes of a complete dual carriageway link between Penrith and Scotch Corner. According to a recent consultants' report prepared for the county council, Furness Enterprise and the West Cumbria Development Agency, the Pounds 195m cost of comprehensively upgrading the A590, A595 and A66 into dual carriageways would be more than recouped by the government, thanks to the benefits of better road links in retaining jobs and attracting new inward investment. Cumbria's communications strategy, launched last November, also calls for improvements to the west coast main rail line and high quality direct links with the Channel Tunnel. The county's lack of scheduled air services is also seen as a deficiency; a study into the feasibility of a West Cumbrian air strip feeder service is in progress. Because of the high technologies involved in the defence and nuclear industries, Cumbria's roads lead to a highly qualified or skilled workforce which could, as experience elsewhere shows, adapt easily to similar levels of technical demands in other sectors. The ethos and culture favour high quality, mistake-free manufacturing, but on its own, the fear is this will not be enough. Mr Harry Knowles, chief executive of Furness Enterprise, says: 'This is a national issue. You cannot leave it to the local community to deal with. We have an asset that has been built up over many years in terms of skills of local people. If we have to rely entirely on local initiatives, we cannot succeed. We need to be able to offer financial incentives to attract inward investors.' The local community is actually doing all it can to pull together - impressing Mr Michael Heseltine, president of the Board of Trade, with a display of positive determination when he launched the Cumbria Marketing Initiative in Barrow two weeks ago. But courage is not enough. As though to prove Cumbria's needs, bad weather forced Mr Heseltine to cancel half his programme because his helicopter could not fly and roads were not quick enough for him to get to Sellafield and back to London in time for a Cabinet meeting. A few days before, a party of Korean electronics industry specialists had been enjoying better weather, with perfect sunsets and the Lake District turning golden with autumn. 'They were very happy with what they found out about the local skills base and the prospects for recruitment,' Mr Knowles says. 'But they were looking for the best package and we are up against competition from Scotland and Wales. Without their sort of financial assistance, you are at an immediate disadvantage.'</p>

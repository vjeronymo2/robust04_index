International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai  said at a hurriedly called press conference, "We should not  leave the talks alone for a long time, despite the need for both  sides to cool down."    "We want to resume (the talks) as soon as possible, keeping  an eye on discussions on the U.S. side," Kumagai said.    Kumagai suggested he will start refining Japan's strategies  for the bilateral negotiations, in the case that they are  resumed, soon after Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Foreign  Minister Tsutomu Hata return to Tokyo.    Asked about possible increased pressure on Japan as a result  of the failure at the summit, Kumagai said, "We cannot tell how  the U.S. Congress will react. For the time being, we will wait  and see the movement of the U.S. administration."    Kumagai said Hosokawa's cabinet will try to keep the U.S.  side from enacting tough policies against Japan, including  revival of the so-called Super 301 trade retaliation clause  imposed against countries considered to practice unfair trade.    "The Japanese side has to convey (to the U.S. Government)  our efforts to correct the trade imbalance," Kumagai said.    On the outlook of Japan-U.S. relations, Kumagai said, "We  have to make efforts to find a compromise after clarifying  differences in opinion, not making conflicts in interest  ambiguous as before."</p>

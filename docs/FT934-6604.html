			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / People: Standard Chartered The retirement of Alan Orsich, 60, as an executive director of STANDARD CHARTERED is a further sign of the tremendous change which has taken place in the boardroom of one Britain's biggest overseas banks. Orsich, who joined Standard Bank in 1950, was one of the last of the career bankers who had worked their way to the top. After working in East Africa, he became chief dealer of Standard Bank in 1969 and spent the rest of his career on the Treasury side of the bank. During Standard Chartered's more difficult periods, Orsich's side of the business continued to generate good profits and he survived many of the management reshuffles which ended the career of other colleagues. Orsich's departure means that David Moir is the only executive director on the Standard Chartered board who has worked for the group for longer than five years. He joined in 1958. Orsich's responsibilities for treasury operations have been taken over by John McFarlane, the former chief executive of Citibank in the UK, who joined last June.</p>

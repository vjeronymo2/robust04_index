			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Fury over Gillette's Spanish closure plans Gillette of the US will come under strong pressure from Spanish regional authorities this week to drop controversial plans to close a razor-blade factory near Seville and transfer production to the UK and Germany. The closure plan carries echoes of the row early last year over the decision by Hoover of the US to stop making vacuum cleaners at Longvic, near Dijon in France, and move its operations to Cambuslang in Scotland. Hoover's move brought French accusations against Britain of 'social dumping' by using lower wages and less favourable working conditions to lure the US company away from France. The Gillette case is another instance of a multinational opting to move its production base within the single-market European Union. Gillette management told staff at the Alcala de Guadaira factory at the weekend that its decision to close was 'irrevocable'. Its plan for cutting excess European capacity involved concentrating production of razors and razor-blades at Isleworth, west London, and in Berlin. The group had announced earlier this year plans to cut 2,000 jobs worldwide. The Spanish plant, which employs about 250, was set up in the 1960s as part of an industrial development plan for the region. Of the three Gillette plants, it is considered to have the least advanced technology. Employees' representatives claimed the Gillette decision was linked to new investments by the company in Russia, Poland and Turkey, where it could take advantage of lower wage costs. Gillette sparked off a similar storm in France in the late-1980s over its withdrawal from manufacturing at Annecy, near the French-Swiss border. Public sentiment in Andalucia has already been primed by a furore over job cuts at Santana Motor, a subsidiary of the Japanese Suzuki group making four-wheel-drive vehicles at Linares. The workforce at Linares is due to be cut by 1,500, leaving about 900.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mikhail Rutkowski] </F>   [Excerpts] At the beginning of today's debate, the floor  was taken by Supreme Soviet Chairman Mechyslaw Ivanovich Hryb.  He appealed to people's deputies and journalists not to support  abortion, while voting on the draft constitution that is to be  adopted by our parliament. I will recall that in their ballots,  deputies are being asked to define their position on the  legislative, executive, and juridical authorities of the  Republic of Belarus, and respond to whether our state should  become a presidential republic. The results of the voting will  be announced next week.    Having heard the speeches delivered in the miscellaneous  section, deputies continued the debate on amendments to the  electoral law. After that, they began to discuss the Supreme  Soviet draft resolution on the volume of foreign debt and trends  in the use and repayments of foreign credits. The draft  resolution specifies that the volume of foreign debt of the  Republic of Belarus will amount to $2 billion until the end of  1994. [passage omitted]    Because today is Friday, deputies voted to shorten the  working day. The session concluded at 1700 [1200 GMT].  Deputies will reconvene at the Oval Hall of the House of  Government next Tuesday.</p>

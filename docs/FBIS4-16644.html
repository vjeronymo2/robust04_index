			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 19 TASS -- By ITAR-TASS -- ROSSIYSKIYE  VESTI carries an interview with Albanian Foreign Minister Alfred  Serreci who dwells on the role of Russia in the Balkans.    "Russia'a presence in the Balkans is a historical fact, and  her current involvement within the context of the development of  events in the former Yugoslavia is realistic... Any  constribution, including that by Russia, and aimed at  establishing peace should be welcomed," Serreci said.    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on Russo-Ukrainian friction over the  Black Sea Fleet:    "Following last year's October events, the correlation of  forces among the political and military elites of Russia has  long become evident.    "Judging by the latest developments, the Ukrainian generals  also consolidate their positions. Do the accords reached suit  the military and can they hinder their enactment? This is a  rhetorical question after a series of events concerning Russia  and ex-Soviet republics".    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA on the Black Sea Fleet:    "The striving of the Ukrainian side individually to divide  the Black Sea Fleet and thereby write it off as a strategic  operational force protecting the southern flanks of both Russia  and Ukraine, has long become an evil tradition.    "Agreements which were signed by the leaders of the two  countries in Yalta, Dagomys, Zavidovo and Massandra and which  were intended to relieve the accumulated tension, damped the  ardour of the Ukrainian military only for a short while, for  they conceived an intention to have a fleet of their own, even  if a small one, resultant of withdrawal of property from Russia.    "That the Black Sea Fleet together with its entire  infrastructure is really Russian is evidenced not only by the  Massandra protocol but also by the exclusively Russian financing  of it since September last year".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on Russo-Azerbaijani relations:    "Everything seems to indicate that that the backstage talks  between Azerbaijani leader Geydar Aliyev and Russian officials  did not lead to progress in discussing the possibiity of a  Russian military presence in Azerbaijan.    "Moscow still failed to persuade Aliyev into allowing to  deploy if only one Russian military base in Azerbaijan".    NOVAYA GAZETA runs an interview with Tajik opposition leader  Khoji Akbar Turajonzoda, who is currently in Moscow. He said:  "Solving the Tajik issue is the key to a settlement of the  conflict situation in Central Asia. This means thousands upon  thousands of human lives.    "We recognise the great role of Russia in resolving the  issue  and are confident that her geopolitical interests are aimed at  restoring peace and stability in the region. The opposition,  and I must say that this means a large proportion of the  population of Tajikistan, wishes to have good-neighbourly  relations with Russia".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the opposition's regaining its  strength:    "Following last year's October defeat, the opposition slowly  but steadily regains its former strength. According to  information available to the newspaper, the second phase of the  1st congress of the Union of Officers took place in Moscow on  April 16 in an atmosphere of semi-secrecy. The congress was  attended by 184 delegates, representing nine republics and 21  regions of Russia.    "It seems that the death of 10 members of the Officers'  Union  during the defence of the parliament building in Moscow during  the October events, a brief ban imposed on the Officers' Union,  and the five-month stay of its leader Stanislav Terekhov (who  was re-elected the chairman of the Officers' Union now), in the  Lefortovo investigative isolation ward, have only added  popularity to this officers' patriotic organisation which has  now become one of the main centres of the unification of  opposition forces".    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA carries an article by Colonel-General  Mikhail  Kolesnikov, chief of the general staff of the Russian Armed  Forces, who pointed out: "Our principled line is to consolidate  the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty and maintain its  vitality. A certain adjustment of its obsolete provisions is  necessary for that...    "Already now we need an utter clarity in order to choose an  optimum configuration of Russia's defence potential and to  prepare an appropriate infrastructure for the accommodation of  troops. Depending on that are both the course of military  reform, the pace of withdrawal of Russian troops to national  territory, and other major aspects of the activities and  development of the Russian Armed Forces."    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI runs an interview with Aleksandr Livshits,  leader of a group of presidential experts.    Livshits is of the opinion that "Russia is now the only CIS  state in which the population's incomes grew quicker than prices  in the first quarter of 1994.    "Judging by absolute living standards, the position of  people  in Russia is on the whole better. In February 1994, by using  the average monthly wage in Moscow, one could buy twice as much  meat in Moscow as in Minsk and 32 times more than in Yerevan".    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI raises the question as to whether Armenia  is threatened with a social outburst.    "The state of affairs in the social sphere can be described  without any exaggeration as disastrous, not just hard.  Following the latest indexation, the average monthly pay of  Yerevan resident is 300 drams. One kilogramme of butter costs  550 drams, one kg of cooked sausage -- 550 drams, sugar -- 150  drams, one litre of vegetable oil -- 280 drams. And this is so  at a time when the main source of permanent income for 80  percent of the population is wage or pension".    PRAVDA carries an interview with Arkadiy Gukasyan, minister  of foreign affairs of Nagorno-Karababkh, who pointed out: "There  are several factors which explain the Karabakh phenomenon. The  main thing is that we know what we fight for. We have nowhere  to retreat. We have no other land. Every resident of  Nagorno-Karabakh is aware that if he shows cowardice, the next  day there would be neither his house nor family.    "We are confronted with Azerbaijanis who are forcibly  brought  to the frontline from Baku, Sumgait, and Kirovabad. They  personally do not need Karabakh at all. They wait for an  opportune moment to desert from the army. So, our successes  should not be accounted for by Armenia's support".    RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA runs an interview with Mikhail Lapshin,  chairman of the Agrarian Party of Russia. He said "the main  thing is to stop attempts to tackle the most complex problems of  the countryside by administrative methods so that some  high-placed official would not sing in the heat of the moment an  ill-considered directive... There are apprehensions on that  score".    SOVETSKAYA ROSSIA carries an interview with Aman Tuleyev,  member of the Federation Council, the upper house of the Russian  parliament.    "Frankly speaking, the Yeltsin-Gaydar reforms have thrown us  back in time to the days of feudal subsistence economy, not just  20-30 years backwards.    "Wages are paid to people in our country in kind by giving  everything from pressing irons, shoes, fabrics, tobacco products  and even meat to medicines and spare parts for motor vehicles."</p>

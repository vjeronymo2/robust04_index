			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FUTURE OF FEAR;  </P> <P> ALZHEIMER'S STRUCK MOLLIE KAPLAN WHEN SHE WAS JUST 59 YEARS OLD. IT IS A  DISEASE MOLLIE CAN'T FIGHT, A DISEASE THAT MAKES HER HUSBAND AS MUCH OF A  VICTIM AS SHE IS HERSELF.  </P> <P> Don't sugarcoat this. It ain't easy for any of us. -- Samuel Kaplan  </P> <P> Mollie Kaplan can remember half a century ago when she was 12 and met her  husband, Samuel, at a Halloween party in the Bronx. She can remember elementary  school penmanship classes, when she changed her name from the Molly on her  birth certificate to Mollie because she had a bad habit of writing the "y"  below the line.  </P> <P> What she can't remember is whether she had breakfast, so sometimes she eats it  twice. She doesn't cook much anymore, because if the recipe calls for salt, she  can't remember whether she added it.  </P> <P> "It's so frustrating," she said. "I can't read a book anymore, because if I  stop and put a bookmark where I leave off, when I pick the book up again, I  don't know what I have read."  </P> <P> Mollie Kaplan is a victim of Alzheimer's disease. But whereas its sufferers  overwhelmingly are age 65 or older, she was just 59 when she was informed she  had it.  </P> <P> And as medical science searches for a cure -- or even a method of diagnosis  other than the exclusion of other possibilities -- more and more attention is  being paid to those instances where Alzheimer's strikes before 65, especially  since heredity is believed to play a significant role in such cases.  </P> <P> This disease, which somehow affects the brain cells and produces intellectual  impairment, is, according to the Alzheimer's Assn., the fourth leading cause of  death among adults, behind heart disease, cancer and strokes. It takes more  than 100,000 lives annually in America.  </P> <P> Consider the statistics:  </P> <P> * About 4 million Americans are afflicted with Alzheimer's (actress Rita  Hayworth was a prominent victim).  </P> <P> * More than 47% of seniors age 85 or older have the illness.  </P> <P> * More than 50% of all nursing home patients are victims of Alzheimer's.  </P> <P> * The financing of care for Alzheimer's patients -- including cost of  diagnosis, treatment, nursing home care, informal care and lost wages -- is  estimated to be more than $80 billion per year.  </P> <P> * Finally, from onset of symptoms, the life span of an Alzheimer's victim can  range from three to 20 or more years.  </P> <P> Peter Braun, executive director of the Los Angeles chapter of  </P> <P> the Alzheimer's Assn., said there are an estimated 650,000 cases of Alzheimer's  disease in California, probably more than 150,000 of them in Los Angeles  County.  </P> <P> Only 10% of Alzheimer's patients, according to the national association, are  classified as early onset (diagnosed before age 65) -- small comfort to someone  who finds herself in that percentage.  </P> <P> Mollie Kaplan was found to have the ailment three years ago. "I wish it were  cancer, because cancer you can fight," she said. "I can't do anything about  this."  </P> <P> For about 30 years, Mollie Kaplan had been a bookkeeper, most recently for a  certified public accounting firm in the San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> Then about three years ago, strange things began to happen. "Sam and I had  separate checking accounts. I had my own account so I could buy groceries and  such. When my monthly statements arrived from the bank, I found I couldn't  reconcile them. Here I had spent my career keeping books for companies, and now  I couldn't figure out my own statement."  </P> <P> She said that although her bosses exerted no pressure, she resigned. "I was in  charge of books for clients, and I was afraid I would start making boo-boos.  You can't do that with clients."  </P> <P> At the same time, her husband recalled, he began to notice small but unusual  things. There was the afternoon Mollie took a short walk from their Agoura  Hills home:  </P> <P> "She had taken the garage door opener with her, but didn't remember it. When  she got back, she thought she had locked herself out. She panicked and phoned  me at work from a neighbor's house, and I came right home."  </P> <P> Mollie: "If there had been pain -- any degree of it -- it would be so easy to  tell you. But I felt nothing."  </P> <P> It was about that time that Mollie Kaplan went to a local hospital for  treatment of an angina attack. While there, she mentioned her increasing  forgetfulness to her family doctor. "He said that they would do a brain scan.  It didn't prove anything, except that there were no signs of clots or tumors."  </P> <P> Since Alzheimer's was suspected, there were other tests, although Mollie said  she doesn't remember them. Sam Kaplan -- while emphasizing that such testing  shouldn't be done on a person's own -- said one test involved showing Mollie a  chain, a light and a doorknob, and later asking her to recall what she had been  shown.  </P> <P> The doctor's conclusion was that she had signs of Alzheimer's disease.  </P> <P> Sam took his wife to another hospital, where extensive psychiatric,  neurological and radiological testing -- a full medical workup -- was done. The  conclusion again: Alzheimer's.  </P> <P> "I wanted another opinion, and it was suggested that we go to Century City  Hospital," Sam said. "Not only did they do the other tests, they did Magnetic  Resonance Imaging. They reached the same conclusion."  </P> <P> From here, the Kaplans don't know where to turn.  </P> <P> "Nothing can be done for her," Sam said, staring out the kitchen window. "We  are learning to live with it."  </P> <P> Mollie said she has no other medical problems, and there has been no recurrence  of angina. She is on no drug regimen, although she previously participated in a  pharmaceutical company's experiment with a memory drug.  </P> <P> She is aware of her increasing mental impairment and can recall some instances:  "I put water in a pot on the stove to boil so Sam would have hot water for  breakfast. Then I went into the bedroom to make the bed. I got so busy with the  bed, I completely forgot about the water boiling."  </P> <P> Mollie had given up smoking, but has taken it up again. As she spoke, she went  around searching for her cigarette lighter, but, unable to remember where it  was, accepted a match from her husband.  </P> <P> "There is an old Yiddish saying," she began. Then a pause. She had already  forgotten what she had intended to say.  </P> <P> Alzheimer's always claims two victims -- the other one being the care-giver. "I  never thought this would happen to me," Sam said, not without emotion. He later  admitted: "I find myself edgy all the time. I was in the express lane at the  supermarket. A guy started writing a check, and I almost decked him.  </P> <P> "People say to me, 'join a support group.' I say fine. But what is Mollie  supposed to do while I am at the group?"  </P> <P> He said he once drove with his wife to such a support group in Thousand Oaks,  but was told that only he would be permitted in. She said she would drive  around for an hour and a half, then pick him up. When that time came, she  couldn't remember the location and had to phone to get specific directions.  </P> <P> Sam said he checked out a day-care center in Thousand Oaks for Alzheimer's  victims. He found both the appearance and the cost to be satisfactory, and made  arrangements at the paint store where he is a salesman to cut his workday to  five hours so he could drop his wife off in the morning and pick her up after  he finished work.  </P> <P> But so far the point is moot. He drove Mollie over to see the place, he said,  but she said she didn't like it.  </P> <P> If nothing else, Mollie retains a disarming sense of humor. When asked about  anything in the recent past, she often replies, "Who remembers? You are talking  with an Alzheimer's."  </P> <P> It isn't much of a humorous matter to Sam, now 64, who still loves the woman he  met half a century ago but wearily confesses: "You don't know what this is like  until you get there."  </P> <P> Since he worries about her while he is at work (and phones whenever he can find  the time), he has considered another approach -- an adult live-in. "We went to  the temples and passed the word around, but it is very difficult to find  someone."  </P> <P> The Kaplans have an extra bedroom, and they are seeking an older woman who  would agree to be on the premises without charge in exchange for free housing.  </P> <P> Right now, all Mollie has for daytime companionship is Mandy, a frisky terrier  the Kaplans rescued from an animal shelter, who likes to chase rubber balls.  Mollie spends time staring at the photos of her grandchildren, held by magnets  to the refrigerator.  </P> <P> And wondering how this happened. In her case, the illness isn't hereditary; she  said no one in her family has ever been diagnosed with Alzheimer's.  </P> <P> "My fear for Babe (their pet name for each other) is depression," her husband  said. "I look for things for her to do. I got her a jigsaw puzzle. I hope  she'll do it."  </P> <P> Although she didn't in the past, Mollie now watches game shows on television.  "I feel it is good for my concentration. It helps me psychologically. If I can  get the answer before the contestant does, I feel I did something good."  </P> <P> Both said the illness has been difficult on their grown daughter and son. On a  visit to their daughter's house, one of the grandchildren poignantly asked:  "Grandma, do you still remember us?"  </P> <P> Sam said: "During a visit, it's not the same family discussion it used to be."  </P> <P> If having a sense of humor can cure, there is hope for Mollie. When her husband  paused to remember their vacation plans, she quipped: "It's catching!"  </P> <P> Since a 100% accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's is possible only by brain  autopsy, Mollie carries an organ donor card in her purse, hoping that some  worthwhile research could result from her death.  </P> <P> "Take my head, please," she said with a laugh.  </P> <P> In an office at the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute, geropsychiatrist and  assistant professor of psychiatry Dr. Gary Small was discussing the $1-million  study he is overseeing, funded by the national Alzheimer's Assn., the state of  California and the federal government.  </P> <P> It will focus on people who have or had a parent or sibling diagnosed with  Alzheimer's and who have anxiety because they themselves are experiencing  memory changes.  </P> <P> "One part of the puzzle we have an answer to," Small said, "is that if you have  a close relative with Alzheimer's, your risk for developing the illness is at  least twice that of the general population."  </P> <P> The psychiatrist said he has some participants already but needs about 100 --  including those at risk and having memory changes, and some who aren't -- to  use as a control group. Participants will get free medical evaluations, MRI  scan, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan, neurological assessment and  annual follow-ups to check their progress.  </P> <P> Small said the PET scan, fairly new, is being used in this Alzheimer's research  because "it has been found to show characteristic patterns of decreased  metabolism in certain brain regions. . . . This may lead to a positive test for  the disease."  </P> <P> These characteristic defects, he said, are more striking in early-onset cases  than in later ones. A PET scan, he continued, may pick up what an MRI scan or  CT(computerized tomographic) scan shows otherwise to be a normal brain.  </P> <P> "Early-onset cases are more likely to be familial," he explained, "and such  cases may be more likely to have rapid progression. Research has identified a  small number of families where there is a high density of Alzheimer's."  </P> <P> Also, he said, researchers are looking into the possibility that Alzheimer's is  caused by a virus.  </P> <P> Typical symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (named after Dr. Alois Alzheimer, a  German neurologist who described it in 1906) include gradual progression of  memory loss or other cognitive losses (language problems, motor skills),  personality change and eventually loss of function.  </P> <P> Personality changes may include hostility, withdrawal, inappropriate laughing,  agitation and paranoia.  </P> <P> Functionally, Small said, one may forget how to eat, how to use the toilet, how  to take care of personal hygiene.  </P> <P> But not all signs of forgetfulness mean Alzheimer's.  </P> <P> Small: "As people reach, say, age 50, there may be age-associated memory  impairment. They will misplace glasses or keys, or have trouble remembering  names.  </P> <P> "But, generally, they will retrieve that information with effort and over time.  An Alzheimer's victim may have identical things happen, but as the disease  progresses, such information can't be retrieved."  </P> <P> What aren't signs? "If you notice mild changes that don't worsen over time,  then don't worry," Small said.  </P> <P> But when testing is indicated, the process of exclusion is what doctors have to  work with. Alzheimer's is usually ruled out if there are signs of blood clots  on the brain; stroke; thyroid, liver or kidney disease; reaction from  medication, or depression.  </P> <P> Brain autopsies after the death of Alzheimer's victims, Small said, show that  current clinical diagnosis has an accuracy rate of 90% at the best research  centers. Such autopsies, he said, show a high concentration of plaques and  tangles in the brain, instead of normal cells.  </P> <P> Helen Kent, 64, a retired attorney from Southern California, is one of the  participants in the Small study. Her 71-year-old brother is in a nursing home  with Alzheimer's.  </P> <P> "Things are happening to me that do disturb me," she admitted. "I was recently  in a Los Angeles courthouse, and in the corridor I ran into a lawyer I have  known for years. I couldn't remember his name. I thought about it the rest of  the day, and I still couldn't remember his name. And I still can't.  </P> <P> "I am hoping this has no relationship to Alzheimer's."  </P> <P> Kent said her recent memory changes are something like what her brother, a  former chemical engineer, went through: "If somebody asks what I did yesterday,  I have to look at my calendar.  </P> <P> "It weighs on my mind, because as an attorney (she retired four years ago), my  memory was absolutely fabulous. My mind was like a steel trap."  </P> <P> Kent said she doesn't see her Alzheimer-stricken brother often because he no  longer recognizes her. When she does visit him, it is because there is always a  glimmer of hope -- but she winds up seeing it dashed.  </P> <P> There is something else she finds disturbing: "Years ago, my brother would  stumble over words. I find myself doing that -- like when I might be trying to  say 'crumb,' I might come up with something such as 'brump.' I mispronounce  entire words."  </P> <P> Various approaches are being used to deal with the baffling malady. Just two  months ago, a new Dementia Evaluation Clinic was established here to enable  geriatricians at two campuses of the Jewish Homes for the Aging of Greater Los  Angeles to better diagnose the disorder.  </P> <P> Jewish Homes has 875 residents, including those in the 120-bed Amado Foundation  Alzheimer's Disease Special Care Unit.  </P> <P> "Age-associated memory impairment is neither progressive nor disabling, whereas  some dementias are both," says a publication of the Alzheimer's Assn. "Dementia  is not a normal part of aging."  </P> <P> Another association publication advises: "Coping with AD means getting ready  for a lot of changes. The person you have known as a breadwinner or homemaker,  as parent or spouse, slowly will lose the ability to fill those roles. At  times, you may find it hard to recognize that he or she is still the same  person."  </P> <P> Because of the length of the illness, the association points out, "the effects  on family finances are likely to be felt for a long time."  </P> <P> Another point: "Although it is difficult to think about, you may eventually  have to place your loved one in a nursing home."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, inside her home in Agoura Hills, Mollie Kaplan can remember way back  when Sam had to go off and serve in the Navy during World War II, and how he  gave her an engagement ring before shipping overseas -- "he wanted to make sure  I wouldn't date other guys."  </P> <P> But if she puts a grocery bag down after returning from the market, she can't  remember where it is.  </P> <P> "They better hurry up with a cure," she mused. "The clock's running out on me."  </P></p>

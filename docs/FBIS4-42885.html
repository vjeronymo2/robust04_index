			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, June 8 (A.A.) -- Foreign Ministry Spokesman  Ferhat Ataman said today that the straits regulations prepared  and declared by Turkey have not been debated by the  International Maritime Organization [IMO] and that the rejection  of the regulations was out of the question.    He was reacting to a recent claim by the Russian Foreign  Ministry that the IMO had not approved the proposals of Turkey  on the straits and that Turkey was asked to adapt its  regulations to the IMO resolutions.    Ataman said that it was not possible to share the Russian  interpretation that the Turkish regulations were rejected by the  IMO.    `The IMO Sea Safety Committee has reviewed and adopted all  rules and recommendations for the passage of ships and traffic  rules,' Ataman said.    Ataman recalled that the straits regulations were issued in  the Official Gazette dated January 11, 1994 and the traffic  charts were approved by the IMO.    `Turkey believes that the regulations to be put into force  on  July 1 and which are in harmony with the IMO regulations,  contain all arrangements to provide security and environmental  protection and are in the interests of all the countries and the  world maritime,' he concluded. [sentence as received]    The straits regulations were prompted by the March 14  collision in the Bosporus of an oil tanker and a freighter which  killed 20 crew members and dumped thousands of barrels of oil  into the waterway.</p>

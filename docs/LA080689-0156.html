			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL HALL OF FAME GAME;  </P> <P> GIBBS, REDSKINS PLAY EVERYONE AND EVERYONE PLAYS WELL, 31-6  </P> <P> Joe Gibbs took attendance, then gave his team a passing grade.  </P> <P> "The high point was that everyone played and we still won," Gibbs said Saturday  after his Washington Redskins beat the Buffalo Bills, 31-6, in the Hall of Fame  exhibition game.  </P> <P> Three quarterbacks and eight running backs got a chance to show Gibbs what they  could do as the Redskins opened the National Football League exhibition season  by outgaining the Bills, 404 yards to 170.  </P> <P> "There were no serious injuries and both teams looked sharp," Gibbs added.  </P> <P> Said Buffalo Coach Marv Levy: "Our goal was to play everyone and get a good  look at a a lot of people. We did that.  </P> <P> "What was disappointing was that no one stood out. That the game was on  national television didn't bother me. That the score was a considerable margin  did bother me."  </P> <P> Willard Reaves scored on a pair of short runs and Mark Rypien completed 10 of  12 passes for 133 yards and a touchdown to lead the Washington offense.  </P> <P> "Our quarterbacks played cautious," Gibbs said. "We ran a lot of out patterns,  a lot of safe patterns. But I thought the quarterbacks got off to a good  start."  </P> <P> Rypien, a fourth-year pro and the starter while Doug Williams recovers from  back problems, said he's not worried about losing the No. 1 job when Williams  gets healthy. Williams was released from the hospital Saturday.  </P> <P> "That's always a possibility," Rypien said. "I can't worry about it. I just go  out and play hard."  </P> <P> Buffalo's starting quarterback, Jim Kelly, played only one series and connected  on two of five passes for 32 yards.  </P></p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Strike closes Canadian pulp and paper mills MOST OF British Columbia's pulp and paper industry has begun shutting down after two unions refused a management offer made at the weekend and mediation efforts failed. The dispute concerns wages, removal of a statutory holiday and the employment of non-union labour. The unions say that the managements' pay offer did not come close to meeting their demands. The province accounts for about 20 per cent of Canada's newsprint production and 12 per cent of the north American total. The company's have about a month's supply in stock but plenty of spare capacity exists in eastern Canada. British Columbia represents 50 per cent of Canadian northern softwood pulp capacity and 18 per cent of north American and Scandinavian capacity. The mills are working at more than 90 per cent of capacity now and buyer stocks are sufficient for more than a month's paper production. If the stoppage lasts several weeks, woodchips would pile up at the sawmills, forcing reductions in timber production.</p>

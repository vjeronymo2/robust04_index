			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Meron Benvenisti: "Jericho Is No Substitute"] </F>   [Text] The right-wing agitation and the government's  stammering have diverted the controversy over the Jerusalem  issue to marginal matters. The establishment of a command  aiming to stop 'Arafat, the calls for his assassination, the  Jerusalem Municipality tax collectors' move against Orient  House, as well as Shim'on Peres' stuttering, legislative  initiatives aimed to curb PLO activities, and the invitation  extended to King Husayn to pray on the Temple Mount -- all these  have served to divert attention from the main problem: The  traditional Israeli stand on the Jerusalem issue does not  correspond with the political reality that took root after the  Declaration of Principles [DOP] was signed and the PLO was  recognized.    In this sense, right-wing spokesmen are right in assailing  the government for permitting the peace process to lead to  concessions on the issue of Jerusalem, and the government cannot  justify its stance by hiding behind hallowed formulas on the  status of Israel's indivisible and nonnegotiable capital.    No matter how frequently government spokesmen declare their  allegiance to the traditional stands, once the Palestinian  national community was acknowledged and willingness to negotiate  the implementation of its national objectives was voiced, that  community and its collective link to Jerusalem became  legitimate. The approximately 200,000 Palestinians who live in  East Jerusalem (but are not Israeli citizens) have the right to  feel an integral part of the Palestinian collective, and after  the DOP, their right to organize their community life and to  rally around their national symbols and authoritative  institutions can no longer be denied.    Indeed, the traditional Israeli stand concerning the  residents of East Jerusalem has been that the demarcation of the  annexation borders severed the city's Arabs from the other West  Bank residents, making them an inseparable part of the State of  Israel. And yet, with the exception of Central Bureau of  Statistics releases, in which East Jerusalem residents feature  among the totals for Israeli Arabs (designated as "non-Jewish"),  no one has ever considered East Jerusalem residents Israelis.    Israel annexed the territory of East Jerusalem but not its  residents. They have remained aliens, deprived of basic civil  rights, devoid of municipal services, and exposed to every kind  of discrimination. Even the attempts to cultivate a minimum of  coexistence expired with the onset of the intifadah, and Israeli  Governments learned to accept the fact that East Jerusalemites  cannot be separated from the great body of the West Bank  population and that they must not cling to the illusion that  East Jerusalem can be wrenched away from its province and made  into some sort of new "mini-Triangle."    It was the intifadah that established Palestinian  institutions in Jerusalem -- most notably Orient House -- and  every Israeli Government put up with their existence. The DOP  imbued these institutions with a new significance, and it is  that with which the Rabin government is trying to deal.    The government decided to differentiate between "governing  institutions" and "voluntary institutions" dealing with social  and community activities. This distinction, which is equal to  the illusion of cutting East Jerusalem off from West Jerusalem,  is only a fantasy and is unbecoming of people who grew up in  Israel's pioneer days and know how voluntary institutions --  such as the Histadrut labor federation -- can become the  cornerstone of the "nascent state's" voluntary governing system.    The truth is that the continued existence of Jewish  voluntary  institutions with "governing characteristics" is responsible for  the legal experts' inability to propose legislation restricting  the activity of the Palestinian institutions.    As long as the Jewish National Fund is situated in the  western part of the city, its Palestinian parallel can hardly be  banned without risking an appeal to the High Court of Justice  that will discuss the petition on the basis of Israeli  legislation and basic laws.    The attempts to harass the East Jerusalem Palestinian  institutions will be as successful as the closure, which  supposedly cut the city off from its surroundings, although it  is no secret that anyone can enter it. Nonetheless, the  government is tackling the institutions exactly as it did the  closure: It would like to keep up appearances in order to  discourage public debate.    It may be able to prevent Yasir 'Arafat from coming to  Jerusalem, but it cannot move Arab Jerusalem to Jericho.    Israelis who believe in the unity of Jerusalem will also  have  to accept the continued existence of central Palestinian  institutions in East Jerusalem. They would do well to remember  the postannexation years, when the Government of Israel made  every possible effort -- all of which failed -- to move the  Palestinian institutions to Ramallah.    East Jerusalem is the West Bank's economic, political, and  social center, and it is the hub of the Palestinians' religious  and national life.    This fact can be neither obfuscated nor forcibly changed.  The sooner the Israelis accept this, the faster will the root  of the problem be discussed. The debate will then focus on the  search for new formulas to resolve the Jerusalem issue --  formulas that will correspond to the new political situation and  will not be based on illusions and wishful thinking.</p>

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / 'Wise men' boost for chancellor Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, can take comfort. His panel of independent economic forecasters expects growth to continue at a healthy rate next year with a continuing expansion of gross domestic product and subdued inflation in the medium term. But as might be expected from six men with very different economic philosophies, there are variations in some of the short-term as well as the medium-term forecasts. All six expect the economy to grow next year at or above the level that economists regard as its long-term trend rate. The average expectation is for GDP growth next year of 3 per cent after 3.6 per cent this year, with forecasts for next year ranging from 2.5 per cent to 3.7 per cent. But they differ on how next year will turn out compared with this year. Mr Andrew Britton of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, Professor David Currie of the London Business School and Professor Tim Congdon of Lombard Street Research expect growth in the non-oil economy will slow to 2.6 per cent or less from about 3 per cent. Professor Wynne Godley of Cambridge University expects non-oil growth to be little changed at 3.1 per cent while Mr Gavyn Davies of Goldman Sachs and Professor Patrick Minford of Liverpool University see growth accelerating to about 3.75 per cent. This splits the group into optimists and pessimists. The group's forecasts for consumption and investment generally divide in the same way as GDP, although all agree that in the next year the balance of growth will shift from consumption towards investment. On inflation, there is a 'rough tendency' for growth pessimists to be inflation pessimists and growth optimists to be optimistic about inflation. The average expectation is for underlying inflation, excluding mortgage interest payments, to rise to 2.9 per cent by the end of next year from 2.2 per cent in the current quarter. Forecasts for end-1995 range from the monetarist Prof Minford's 1.9 per cent to the neo-Keynesian Prof Godley's 3.9 per cent. There are some striking short-term variations in current account forecasts and significant differences in expectations for unemployment. The average expectation of next year's current account deficit, at Pounds 5bn, is little changed from this year's average forecast of Pounds 4.8bn. But Prof Godley forecasts a 1995 current account deficit of Pounds 12bn, reflecting his doubts about the strength of the UK's non-oil trade. Prof Congdon forecasts a current account surplus of Pounds 2.1bn next year. In his submission to the panel, Prof Congdon says that 'at current exchange rates, UK exports are competitive, perhaps even highly competitive'. All panelists expect UK unemployment to be about 2.5m at the end of this year and most expect a fall of about 250,000 through 1995. But Prof Currie expects his forecast of slower growth will cause unemployment to rise slightly to 2.6m by the end of next year before starting to fall again. Prof Minford forecasts a sharp fall to below 2m, partly because he expects stronger growth and partly because he believes unemployment will revert to a lower trend rate than during the 1980s. Looking to the very long term, the panel believes it should be possible for the UK economy to return to a low level of unemployment of possibly between 3 per cent and 5 per cent compared with more than 9 per cent at present. But this will depend on policies which encourage a period of moderate and balanced growth of demand. The Panel of Independent Forecasters, November 1994 Report. HM Treasury.

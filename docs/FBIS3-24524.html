			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by N.P. Danilova, N.V. Krupina, M.V. Mertts, and </F> R.G. Vasilov, Biotekhnologiya Scientific Production Association,  Moscow; UDC 577.175.444.083.3]    [Abstract] Most immunoassay methods of determining thyroxin  are based on polyclonal sera. In most cases, this does not  present any problems with respect to specificity of the said  antibodies. Problems do arise in cases of antisera with a low  titer resulting from the presence of endogenous thyroxin in  immunized animals. A portion of the binding centers on the  antibodies with the highest affinity are then occupied by  endogenous thyroxin. This is a common problem in obtaining  antibodies to endogenous compounds that can be overcome by using  monoclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies to thyroxin with  binding constants of 1.96 x 10[.sup]9[/] and 2.6 x  10[.sup]9[/] M[.sup]-1[/] for the high-affinity antibodies  have been obtained in several laboratories. Monoclonal  antibodies have now been obtained that have a binding constant  of 3 x 10[.sup]9[/] M[.sup]-1[/]. The new monoclonal  antibodies were obtained by immunizing BALB/c mice with keyhole  limpet hemocyanin and thyroxin conjugate and then fusing spleen  cells from the immunized mice with P3-X63-Ag8.653 mouse myeloma  cells. Polyethylene glycol 4000 was used as a fusing agent.  About 400 clones formed in one hybridization. The four  highest-affinity monoclonal antibodies (9T, 1B7, 2E10, and 10F9)  were selected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] and  partially characterized. The four monoclonal antibodies all  manifested good binding with thyroxin, but they differed greatly  from one another with respect to affinity to triiodothyronine.  The hybridoma producing the said monoclonal antibodies grew well  in ascites tumors. Antibodies were isolated from ascites by  ion-exchange chromatography. According to gel-electrophoresis  data, the ascites contained only one type of antibody, i.e.,  1B7. 1B7 was determined to belong to the IgG1 subclass and to  have a cross-reactivity with triiodothyronine of less than 1  percent and an affinity constant of 3 x 10[.sup]9[/]  M[.sup]-1[/]. Further studies to determine the possibility of  using the new antibodies in immunoassay of thyroxin established  that 8-aniline-1-naphthalenesulfate in rather high  concentrations (0.05 percent) did not affect antibody-antigen  binding. The calibration cure obtained for thyroxin measurement  was linear in log coordinates at thyroxin concentrations of 10  to 400 ng/ml. Figures 4; references 8 (Russian).</p>

Hall, president of La Linda Homes of  Orange and president of the California Building Industry Assn., was heard  complaining about the lack of quality in some developments.  </P> <P> Hall wouldn't name names, but he said during a session at the San Francisco  conference that he is sometimes shocked by the work he sees at some of his  competitors' projects.  </P> <P> Still, he said, at the prices even "cheap" homes fetch in Orange County,  developers are learning that customers will no longer put up with inferior  workmanship.  </P></p>

			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Poll setback for Dutch coalition Local elections have dealt a blow to the Netherlands' two ruling parties ahead of the May general election, writes Ronald van de Krol. Support for the Christian Democrats (CDA) of Mr Ruud Lubbers, the prime minister, (left) fell to 25 per cent of the vote on Wednesday, from 33.8 per cent in the last local elections in 1990. Their coalition partner, Labour, led by Mr Wim Kok, the finance minister, won 20.4 per cent of the vote, down from 26.2 per cent. The main winners were the two largest opposition parties, the right-wing Liberals and centrist D66, and a number of smaller parties, including the far-right. If the local election results were translated into parliamentary seats, CDA and Labour would lose their majority in the 150-member lower chamber, with their combined seats falling to 71 from 103 in the 1989 general election. However, local elections are not reliable as a guide to national elections.</p>

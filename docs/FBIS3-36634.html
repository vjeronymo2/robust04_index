But fate so decreed -- 4  February saw the completion of the almost two-month marathon to  choose the new head of the Pentagon.    Reports that President Bill Clinton had chosen William Perry  as his latest candidate for the post of defense secretary were  headlined in various ways in different American newspapers:  "Mathematics Professor Gets Difficult Job"; "Pentagon Number Two  Becomes Number One." All of them got it right.    Hitherto he held the post of first deputy secretary of  defense, a very responsible post but one, in general terms, with  a not very high public profile. In this capacity, as the  right-hand man to the retiring Les Aspin, William Perry played a  considerable role in preparing and implementing the revision of  the strategic concept for America's military-organizational  development. He also gained a detailed grasp of all the nuances  and subtleties of the budget battles in and around Congress. He  also managed to build working, and to some extent personal,  contacts with the top U.S. generals.    Addressing hearings of the Senate Armed Services Committee,  Perry stated that in his activity at the head of the U.S.  defense machine he intends to continue to a considerable extent  the strategic course set by his predecessor and former boss.  This is not surprising. First, he himself had a hand in  formulating this line and, second, the main guidelines of the  country's military policy are dictated by perfectly obvious  objective factors. There is no way Perry can get away from the  need to reform the Armed Forces, nor can he ignore the  increasing requirement for American troops to participate in  multinational coalitions, including when peacekeeping operations  are being conducted.    However, some new strands can also be detected in the new  defense secretary's first public statements. Among these one  might single out the point that henceforth American troop  contingents -- whether they are under the UN flag or NATO  auspices -- will nonetheless be under American national command.  The only exception envisaged is for small units up to company  level. Definite conclusions have evidently been drawn from the  Somalia operation, whose none too successful outcome had a  negative impact on the Clinton administration's prestige and did  not strengthen the former defense secretary's position, either.    All the indications are that William Perry will also have a  new approach to the problems of forming the defense budget. He  does not intend to repeat the mistake made by Les Aspin, who  advocated a drastic and substantial reduction in U.S. military  expenditure. This is why the word both on Capitol Hill and on  the right bank of the Potomac is already that this process is  necessary but will be more "cosmetic" in nature. During the  Senate hearings Perry himself mentioned a shortfall of $20  billion in the draft budget for fiscal 1995. Avoiding  categorical statements as to whether he agrees or disagrees with  this kind of deficit, the new Pentagon boss promised to find the  money earmarked for paying servicemen's wages at the new,  increased rate by cutting expenditure on certain weapons  systems. So all the niceties will be observed: We have cuts in  the military budget but they do not undermine the foundations of  combat readiness (since cutting expenditure on these weapons  systems one way or another had been suggested under the previous  leadership).    It is easier to understand William Perry's skill or, if you  like, his inventiveness when you remember that before the  Pentagon he headed up a number of enterprises in the U.S.  defense industry, including big ones like United Technologies  and FMC, and that he also worked for a big investment banking  company in Sam Francisco. The defense secretary's career resume  is indeed an impressive one.    He is a mathematician by training who studied at Stanford  and  the University of Pennsylvania, the holder of many academic  titles and degrees, and a member of the National Engineering  Academy, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the  Committee on International Security and Arms Control under the  National Academy of Sciences. He has been a member of a group  of advisers to the foreign intelligence service, the Senate  Technology Review Commission, and the Board of Trustees of the  Carnegie International Foundation. In the early sixties he was  a Pentagon technical expert, and in the Carter administration he  held the post of deputy secretary for research and development  and was in charge of arms purchases.    In "scrutinizing" the as yet still a contender for the  defense secretaryship, as is common practice in America (it was  precisely this which finished off the previous candidate for  Pentagon leader, retired admiral Robert Inman) journalists noted  William Perry's great erudition. In their words, Perry has a  pretty good knowledge of the works of Victor Hugo and Graham  Greene. He has pretty liberal views on the role of women in the  armed forces. Perry himself has five daughters, and his wife is  an accountant and economist.    U.S. senators consider that 67-year-old William Perry will  be  "an excellent defense secretary" and "a real professional with  enormous practical experience." He was given a similar  testimonial by President Clinton when he nominated Perry for the  post of defense secretary. The new Pentagon boss' view of  relations with Russia and its immediate neighbors is not without  interest for us. The development of events in Russia, he says,  can and must be controlled only by the Russians themselves. At  the same time Perry agrees with Bill Clinton's view that help  for the implementation of democratic reforms in Russia is a most  important priority for U.S. national security and the policy of  ensuring lasting and stable peace. William Perry also sees it  as one of his most important tasks in his new post to promote  the nuclear disarmament of Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and  Russia.    It has been reported from Washington that top officials in  the U.S. Administration offered the post of defense secretary to  almost a dozen prominent American politicians and businessmen.  Virtually all of them, including Senate Armed Services  Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, former Republican Senator Warren  Rudman, and Martin Marietta boss Norman Augustine turned down  this honored but exacting post. William Perry joyfully accepted.  He believes that in his new job he will be able to worthily  serve his country and the American people.</p>

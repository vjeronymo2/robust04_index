			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Management: Full of beans but unable to fight fatigue - Dr Michael McGannon explains why it is risky to drink too much coffee / Health Check Fatigue is a serious problem for the manager of the 1990s. Unfortunately, the remedy chosen by most people - a cup of coffee, or five or six - may be more serious still. By automatically reaching for the coffee pot, managers may be adding to their fatigue, increasing sleeplessness, and making their bodies unable to deal with jet-lag. Caffeine, which was introduced by Arabs in the 15th century, has long been used to bolster flagging energy levels. However it is becoming increasingly clear that there is a level at which caffeine stops being a harmless stimulant to the central nervous system and becomes an irritant and health hazard. In moderation, caffeine consumption poses no serious health problem. However the difficulty is to determine exactly what this safe level is: it depends on how the coffee (or to a lesser extent, tea) was prepared. Caffeine comes from a family of stimulants which come from coffee beans, tea leaves, cocoa beans and cola nuts, and are used in headache pills, anti-sleep pills, pain-killers, diet and allergy pills, anti-asthma pills and flavourings. Coffee is the most concentrated form of caffeine: an espresso contains at least 300 milligrams, whereas a cup of American-style brewed coffee has only 100 mgs. Tea and most colas contain about half that. To confuse matters further, some people are more sensitive to caffeine than others. This makes it is hard to establish a clear causal relationship between consumption of caffeine and its ill effects, although it is generally agreed that in excessive quantities (500-1,000 mgs) and in sensitive people, caffeine damages both mental and physical performance. The most common symptoms are: rapid and irregular heart beats, increased breathing rates, dehydration and mineral loss, increased production of stomach acid (possibly leading to ulcers, sleeplessness, irritability and tremulousness. WHAT TO DO If you have a heart problem, ulcers, or are pregnant, caffeine, in all its forms, is off-limits. Consider herbal teas or orange juice instead. Those not in these risk groups, should monitor the symptoms to assess their own caffeine threshold. If you feel nervous, tremulous or cannot sleep, ask yourself how much caffeine you have consumed that day. If you are particularly sensitive, check labels on foods. There may be a hidden sources of caffeine, such as chocolate. If you genuinely enjoy the taste, shift to decaffeinated, or drink tea. Enjoy beverages that contain caffeine for the taste and effect, but compensate for the fluid loss by drinking more water and eating more fruit.

			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Provisions put Laing Pounds 65.3m in red JOHN LAING yesterday became the second large construction group this week to announce a pre-tax loss for 1991 after making large provisions to cover the collapse of UK property values. The deficit was Pounds 65.3m after an exceptional provision of Pounds 87.8m, compared with profits of Pounds 20.1m. About two thirds of the writedown was against housing land in southern England. It is Laing's first pre-tax loss since it was floated in 1954. Immediately after the announcement the shares fell from 160p to 128p but later recovered to close 5p down at 155p. Mr Martin Laing, chairman, said in the light of 'a thumping great loss' the company had decided to cut its final dividend from 10p to 6p for a total of 9p (13p) for the year. Group turnover rose from Pounds 1.53bn to Pounds 1.59bn. After all deductions the group incurred losses per share of 57.4p in 1991 resulting in a Pounds 58m transfer from reserves. The Pounds 7.9m cost of funding dividends was met from cashflow. At the end of last year net cash was Pounds 23.4m. A divisional breakdown showed operating losses for housing of Pounds 2.8m (Pounds 5.8m), Pounds 3.9m (Pounds 3.1m) losses for property development, Pounds 2.8m losses, compared with Pounds 1.5m profit, for the technology division and profits of Pounds 30.9m (Pounds 27.8m) for contracting, which produced a slightly higher margin of 2.4 on turnover increased from Pounds 1.22bn to Pounds 1.29bn. The number of UK private homes sold by the group fell from 1,627 to 1,231. Average prices, however, were marginally higher at Pounds 68,800. The number of homes sold in Virginia and California rose from 360 to 374 but average prices fell by about a tenth. Construction profits are likely to fall this year with the group's order book worth Pounds 1.38bn at the end of 1991 compared with orders worth Pounds 1.88bn at the end of 1990. Margins are also likely to come under pressure as a result of a sharp downturn in UK construction activity. Mr Laing said that UK house sales had improved by about 10 per cent in the first 2 1/2 months of this year. However, that compared with a depressed period last year when sales were affected badly by the Gulf war. The improvement in sales had been much greater in California. COMMENT The fall in Laing's share price, after the initial shock at the size of the writedown, was limited to just 5p. The market appeared to be taking the view that the worst was now over. Laing previously had made only a small provision against its UK housing operations, which it had hoped would have been starting to improve by now. Instead things have got worse. Furthermore, Laing is heavily involved in south-east England where values have been hit badly by the recession. Following the provisions, the company should make an average profit of about Pounds 12,000 a house. Any price rises should come straight through to profit. Contracting earnings, however, will fall this year. A group profit of Pounds 20m on a 33 per cent tax charge would place Laing on prospective p/e of about 10. The balance sheet is strong but after last year's shock the shares may be under pressure for a while.</p>

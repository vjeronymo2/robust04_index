			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Berlusconi sets out his claim to leadership Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate, yesterday staked his claim to the Italian leadership before a crowd of 2,000 supporters gathered in Rome for the first convention of his movement, Forza Italia (Come On Italy]). His message was simple. He represented the sole new face in politics. Italy's fortunes would revive within five years with him running the country. Italians would enjoy a 'new miracle'. For Mr Berlusconi, the enemy to beat in the March elections is the left, led by the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS). Defeating the left was the best guarantee of basic freedoms. His values, he said, were based on the family and rooted in liberal democracy. Italy needed a state that worked for the citizen and encouraged, not penalised, the entrepreneur. He pledged to cut taxes, saying it was possible to reduce fiscal pressure by 1 percentage point a year. Forza Italia's 40-point programme was the most detailed ever prepared by an Italian party to fight a general election, he claimed. It would be released on February 25. Having decided to leave his Fininvest business empire for politics only two weeks ago, Mr Berlusconi seemed still overawed by his new role. As he stood on the podium backed by giant screen image projection and loud music, the overall impression was of a slick promotional package that dominated the man. His style of speaking lacked the rhetoric and toughness of a politician or the timing of a public speaker. His performance was a mix between those of a company chairman talking to shareholders and a chat-show host searching for the invisible public beyond the studio audience. Mr Berlusconi was careful to pay tribute to the populist Northern League for its historic role in breaking the mould of Italian politics. This olive branch signalled that an alliance of the two was close. Suggestions of such a link brought loud applause from the Forza Italia delegates. So did the hints of linking with the neo-fascists. A selection of Forza Italia parliamentary candidates was brought on stage - businessmen, farmers, the wife of a professional footballer, and a Milan magistrate who had been involved in anti-corruption investigations. All had the same clean, scrubbed look as Mr Berlusconi. The delegates and supporters, double the number expected by the organisers, were also briefed by the movement's pollster, who produced statistics demonstrating the strength of Italians' faith in Mr Berlusconi. There were almost 300 spots on Berlusconi television channels during January 15-28, the time when he announced his decision to enter politics. The marketing of Mr Berlusconi has begun.</p>

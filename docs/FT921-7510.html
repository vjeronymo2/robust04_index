			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Nestle ponders bid for Exor as Perrier battle heightens NESTLE, the Swiss food group, may consider mounting a counter bid to the Agnelli family's FFr5.6bn (Pounds 570m) offer for Exor, the controlling shareholder in Perrier, the French mineral water company for which Nestle is in the throes of a FFr13.4bn hostile bid. Mr Reto Domeniconi, director-general of Nestle, said in Paris yesterday that his company had considered the feasibility of bidding for Exor, which controls 35 per cent of Perrier. Any bid would be made together with Banque Indosuez, the French bank, its partner in the bid for Perrier. 'The price offered by the Agnellis for Exor is relatively low and there is clearly room for another bid,' he said. 'So far we have decided against a counter-bid. But we cannot exclude the possibility in the future.' The fight for Perrier, a bitter battle involving some of the best-known names in Europe's industrial establishment, has moved into the legal arena while the protagonists await the conclusion of two French court cases which will be critical in determining the outcome of Nestle's bid. The commercial court at Nimes in southern France has since Tuesday been considering Nestle's appeal to freeze the voting rights on the Perrier shares held by Exor and Societe Generale, the French bank. Next Tuesday the Paris commercial court will begin a second case in which Nestle is trying to annul the recent acquisition of 13.8 per cent of Perrier by Saint Louis, the French sugar company allied to the Agnellis. Unless Nestle wins at least one case, its hopes of seizing control of Perrier seem slight, given that the Agnelli/Exor camp controls nearly 49 per cent of the voting stock. Mr Domeniconi said Nestle was prepared to negotiate an amicable settlement over Perrier. He said he believed the Agnellis would be willing to negotiate, but that the boards of Perrier and Exor, both chaired by Mr Jacques Vincent, were not. Legally, Nestle would have to negotiate a settlement with the Perrier or Exor boards. Yesterday the Perrier board issued a formal statement rejecting the Swiss group's offer. All the directors voted for rejection apart from Mr Philippe Jaffre, president of Credit Agricole, the French bank that owns 2.5 per cent of Perrier, which has already announced its support for Nestle.</p>

			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL'S FIRST LATINOS FACE LIST OF VOWS;  </P> <P> POLITICS: TWO WHO MADE HISTORY IN HUNTINGTON PARK ARE POISED TO CARRY OUT  CAMPAIGN PROMISES. BUT FIRST THERE ARE FENCES TO MEND.  </P> <P> Raul Perez and Luis Hernandez acknowledge that they have plenty of work ahead  of them as the first Latino councilmen in the history of this overwhelmingly  Latino city.  </P> <P> "We're going to have to produce," said Perez, a 47-year-old loan officer.  "We're going to have to show something for the election."  </P> <P> There are several campaign promises to fulfill:  </P> <P> * Increase civic participation in a city where council meetings are routinely  attended by fewer than 10 people.  </P> <P> * Increase citizenship among the city's large immigrant population.  </P> <P> * Increase the number of Latino commissioners and move Latinos into management  positions in City Hall.  </P> <P> * Fight crime in a city where gang-related incidents are becoming increasingly  common.  </P> <P> * Ensure that the city remedies financial problems that forced 25 layoffs last  year.  </P> <P> But those pledges hinge on how well Perez and Hernandez get along with each  other and veteran Councilmen William P. Cunningham, Thomas E. Jackson and Jack  W. Parks.  </P> <P> Hernandez, a 29-year-old financial analyst, has been at odds with the  incumbents for months. He has attacked them at council meetings, blaming them  for the city's financial problems and accusing them of being part of a "good  ol' boy" network that is out of touch with the majority of Huntington Park's  59,000 residents. More than 90% of those residents are Latinos.  </P> <P> Cunningham and Parks said last week that they are confident they will be able  to work with Perez, and that they will try to work with Hernandez.  </P> <P> "I haven't sat with him (Hernandez) on the council yet," Cunningham said. "I'd  rather not have him there."  </P> <P> Parks said: "He's just one vote. He may be boisterous but he's not going to  control everything. Majority rules."  </P> <P> Jackson, Hernandez's most frequent target, declined to comment. Hernandez  called for Jackson's resignation several months ago, saying that the councilman  had received discounted trash service for his local business from a garbage  company that once operated in the city. Jackson has admitted he received the  discount, but said he didn't know he was receiving the price break and put a  stop to it once he found out.  </P> <P> Hernandez said he still would like to see Jackson resign, but added that he  will try to cooperate with his new colleagues. "I'm going to talk to each and  every councilman and try to bury the hatchet so we can move forward," Hernandez  said.  </P> <P> Despite their common goals, Hernandez is just about as much at odds with Perez  as he is with the incumbents, partly because of their contrasting styles.  </P> <P> Perez sees himself as a team player who has more than paid his dues. He had run  for City Council and lost five times before winning a seat in last Tuesday's  election. Political representation for Latinos was a cornerstone of his  campaign. He said he spent about $8,000 on his campaign.  </P> <P> Hernandez grew up in and around the Huntington Park area, but moved to the East  Coast after graduating from USC in 1985. He moved back into the area in  mid-1989.  </P> <P> Hernandez said he spent about $30,000 in winning his first campaign for City  Council. He has not filed his campaign disclosure statements as required by  state law and is subject to a $200 fine. Hernandez said he did not turn in the  statements because some of his contributors feared retaliation from the  incumbents. He said he would turn in the statements next week.  </P> <P> In contrast to Perez, Hernandez downplayed the issue of Latino political  representation, focusing instead on the city's financial problems.  </P> <P> But the differences between the two were aggravated considerably after a  pro-business political action committee -- the Southern California Caucus --  put out a mailer the Saturday before the election.  </P> <P> Among other things, the mailer accused Hernandez of falsely telling voters he  was a Vietnam veteran. It urged residents to vote for Perez and the two  incumbents.  </P> <P> "I think the Hispanic community feels very betrayed by what Raul had done in  his attack on me," said Hernandez, who denied that he ever claimed he was a  veteran.  </P> <P> Perez acknowledged that some alarmed voters had called and questioned his role  in the mailer. He said he had applied for the support of the PAC months before  the election but hadn't heard anything since. He said he did not give  permission for his name to be used.  </P> <P> "I never knew this thing was going to come out," Perez said. "Sometime down the  road we're going to have to be able to talk. I think we have the same goals in  mind."  </P> <P> Tim Carey, the executive director of the Southern California Caucus, could not  be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Perez said he has started making arrangements to hold several neighborhood  meetings next month to get more local residents involved in city government. He  envisions working on a citizenship drive. The 1980 Census indicated that 54% of  the city's Latino residents were not citizens. Perez said he also plans to  visit local schools.  </P> <P> "It's important now that Hispanics are elected that they show up (in the  community)," Perez said. "We need a lot of role models."  </P> <P> Hernandez also talks of organizing a citizenship drive for city residents and  entering the schools to deliver a message against gangs and drug abuse. He  talks of giving Latinos opportunities to fill more key positions in City Hall.  </P> <P> None of the city's top nine administrators are Latinos, and only two of the  city's 18 appointed commissioners are Latinos.  </P> <P> "Things like that have to change," Hernandez said. "This is a new era."  </P> <P> Perez was the top vote-getter with 1,775 votes, followed by Cunningham, who  received 1,500 votes. Hernandez finished with 1,366 votes, 27 votes ahead of  Councilman Jim Roberts, who lost the seat he had held since 1970.  </P> <P> Thirty-six percent of the city's 7,604 registered voters turned out in last  Tuesday's election compared to the 32% who voted in the last council contest in  1988.  </P> <P> The new councilmen are scheduled to be sworn in on Tuesday.  </P></p>

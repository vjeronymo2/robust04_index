			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Time to declare a rare vintage year for gilts Every once in a while UK government bonds produce a spectacular annual return as the markets are caught facing the wrong way. It happened in 1977 when the total rate of return on long-dated gilts was 50 per cent and again in 1982 with 54 per cent. Here we go again with a return for 1993 which could approach 40 per cent as long yields slip below 6.5 per cent. Nobody predicted this. A year ago all the comment was about how difficult it would be to finance the sharply rising budget deficit. Many thought that the initial yield of 8 3/4 per cent would have to go up, and indeed for a few pessimistic weeks in January it did, peaking at 9 per cent. The lowest year-end forecast for long yields that I can recall was that of Midland Bank's Roger Bootle, who picked 7 3/4 per cent (incidentally, he is forecasting 5 3/4 per cent for this time next year). Through the middle of the year the US Treasury long bond yield appeared to be making all the running, but it stalled in October while bond yields in many other countries, including the UK and Japan, have continued to decline. As a result the gap between government long bond yields in the US and the UK has dropped this year from 140 to only about 20 basis points. The rare presence of an index-linked sector in the gilt-edged market makes it possible to calculate that more than half of the drop has reflected a sharp fall in inflation expectations: the long-term inflation crudely implied by the gap between fixed interest and real yields started at 4.9 per cent but has now slipped to 3.6 per cent (on a more sophisticated analysis it is rather less than this, because of the risk premium contained within the fixed interest yield). At the same time the real yield itself has fallen, from 3.8 per cent to 2.9 per cent. The much tougher fiscal stance progressively adopted by the British government in two budgets this year has been an important factor in driving down nominal yields. But the decline in the real yield is essentially a global phenomenon. Falling inflation, too, can be partly attributed to overseas influences, which is why the decline was so difficult to forecast on the basis of historical British experience. The advanced industrial economies appear to be in the grip of overcapacity and intense competition. When long gilt yields tumbled from 15.6 to 10.9 per cent in 1982, also reflecting a sharply tightened fiscal policy and in anticipation of a drop in inflation towards the 5 per cent it reached at the end of the year, they eventually hit a credibility barrier because of the persistence of underlying inflationary forces, as shown by the persistent rapid growth of broad money and earnings. Gilt yields subsequently fluctuated around 10 per cent until 1991. This time yields are searching for a new base level to reflect the much lower underlying inflation suggested by growth in broad money and earnings of only 5 and 3 per cent respectively. However, the eventual answer will not depend entirely, or necessarily even primarily, on domestic considerations because gilts now represent about 5 per cent of the global capitalisation of government bonds in a market which is becoming more and more integrated. Yield differentials have contracted sharply over the past year or two. But some countries still stand out from the crowd. This year long gilts may have outpaced US Treasuries but they have not been able to hold a candle to the currency-boosted returns on Japanese government bonds, where even at the less volatile 10-year maturity the total return to a dollar-based investor has been around 30 per cent. Bond yields in Japan may now be heading below 3 per cent as inflation turns negative and investors perceive that real yields may still be too high. The sub-3 per cent area is where gilt yields were in the mid-1930s (and again, somewhat artificially, in 1946). But it could only happen again if the British government, like its Japanese counterpart on current evidence, became overwhelmed by forces of deflation beyond its ability to respond. Judging by the relatively vigorous economic recovery now taking place in the UK, such a further gilt-edged bonanza is not going to happen any time soon. But never mind, 1993 has been a truly wonderful year for bond investors.</p>

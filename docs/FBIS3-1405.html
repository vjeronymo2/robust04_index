Our reporters on  the scene say the atmosphere is peaceful but that police are  maintaining a strong presence and the area had been cordoned  off. Shops in central Durban have been closed since 10 AM [0800  GMT] and workers have been sent home. The ANC has said the  purpose of the march is to call for free political activity,  especially in areas under the administration of the kwaZulu  government.</p>

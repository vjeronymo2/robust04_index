Violations of CSO-related requirements in NPDES permits; consent decrees or court orders which predate this policy; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Other CWA violations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA will not seek penalties for past CSO violations from permittees that fully comply with the Phase I permit or enforceable order requiring compliance with the Phase I permit. For permittees that fail to comply, EPA will exercise its enforcement discretion in determining whether to seek penalties for the time period for which the compliance schedule was violated. If the milestone dates of the enforceable schedule are not achieved and penalties are sought, penalties should be calculated from the last milestone date that was met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the time of the judicial settlement imposing a compliance schedule implementing the Phase II permit requirements, EPA will not seek penalties for past CSO violations from permittees that fully comply with the enforceable order requiring compliance with the Phase I permit and if the terms of the judicial order are expeditiously agreed to on consent. However, stipulated penalties for violation of the judicial order generally should be included in the order, consistent with existing Agency policies. Additional guidance on stipulated penalties concerning long-term CSO controls and attainment of WQS will be issued.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The information collection requirements in this policy have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and have been assigned OMB control number 2040&hyph;0170.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This collection of information has an estimated reporting burden averaging 578 hours per response and an estimated annual recordkeeping burden averaging 25 hours per recordkeeper.

			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Russians deny sale of diamonds Russia's State Precious Metals Committee yesterday denied allegations by De Beers that it was selling uncut diamonds to the Antwerp market in breach of an agreement to sell only through the South African diamond cartel, Reuter reports from Moscow. The committee, Komdragmet, has nothing to do with exports and did not leak diamonds to the market in breach of the deal with De Beers said Mr Boris Pozdnyakov, the committee's deputy chairman. 'We never exported any diamonds to the Antwerp market,' he said. But he attacked the De Beers contract, saying Russia was losing at least 30 per cent of its potential profits in diamond sales because of the agreement.</p>

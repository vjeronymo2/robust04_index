			<p>BFN     [Text] The Leading Committee of the Fattah Corrective  Stream [al-lajnatu al-qiyadiyatu litayyar fattah al-tashihi] in  the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] has sent a cable to Lieutenant  General brother 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the  Presidential Council, on the occasion of the blessed 'Id al-Adha  and the fourth anniversary of the Republic of Yemen. The cable  stressed that the committee adheres to the unity of Yemen in  that it rehabilitates the history of the country. It stated its  rejection of the secessionist step taken by the traitor 'Ali  Salim al-Bid and his secessionist gang, and called for purging  the country of this rotten band. The cable said that far from  echoing the grass roots opinion in the YSP, the decision only  speaks for the secessionist gang led by al-Bid. The Leading  Committee of the Fattah Corrective Stream in the YSP appealed to  the brother chairman and members of the Presidential Council to  take a determined stand against this separatist step which aims  to take the Yemeni people back to the era of division and to  kill democracy.    The committee emphasized that it is taking the side of  constitutional legality and its courageous forces as they stand  up to the gang of apostasy and secession inside the YSP.</p>

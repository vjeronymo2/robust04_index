			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOUGHT BUSH HUD POST;  </P> <P> EX-REAGAN AIDE WAS PROBED AS HE LOBBIED  </P> <P> Thomas T. Demery lobbied to be appointed secretary of housing and urban  development while knowing he was under investigation for allegedly mishandling  a federal housing program, records released today show.  </P> <P> As assistant secretary for housing at HUD for two years, "I have become greatly  challenged and sensitized to the public policy questions surrounding the  homeless, the availability of low-income housing, and the difficulty the  elderly and first-time home buyers face in finding affordable housing," Demery  said in a form letter to congressmen dated Dec. 7, 1988.  </P> <P> The position went to former Rep. Jack Kemp (R-N.Y.), and Demery has gone into  private consulting. But Demery's conduct at HUD is being examined as part of  the investigation of alleged fraud, abuse and mismanagement at the agency  during the Reagan Administration.  </P> <P> The letter was sent to Sens. Gordon J. Humphrey (R-N.H.), Donald W. Riegle  (D-Mich.), Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), Rep. Carl D. Pursell (R-Mich.) and Robert  Teeter, then co-director of the office of President-elect Bush.  </P> <P> The letters were contained in files opened to the press today under the Freedom  of Information Act.  </P> <P> Demery could not immediately be reached. A woman answering his telephone said  Demery is on vacation.  </P> <P> Demery is a former Michigan real estate agent and mortgage broker who worked in  Ronald Reagan's successful 1980 campaign. As assistant housing secretary, he  administered several of HUD's biggest programs, including $225 million in  moderate-rehabilitation funds awarded annually and the massive Federal Housing  Administration's mortgage insurance program.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Influence Peddling Revealed  </P> <P> The rehabilitation program has been revealed to have been governed by influence  peddling while the FHA lost millions of dollars annually through loan defaults  and mismanagement.  </P> <P> In particular, HUD's inspector general was investigating in 1988 whether Demery  had misused his position to induce contractors seeking HUD business to  contribute to his pet charity, F.O.O.D. for Africa. The inspector general  concluded that Demery may have traded on his position, but last month the  Justice Department said it saw no evidence of criminal wrongdoing.  </P> <P> The inspector general's investigation began early in 1988, and by autumn it was  apparent that Demery was among its targets.  </P></p>

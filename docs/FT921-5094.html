			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Ben Bailey declines to Pounds 107,000 Further eroded margins resulted in a sharp fall, from Pounds 326,000 to Pounds 107,000, in pre-tax profits at Ben Bailey Construction in the six months to December 31. Turnover at this Yorkshire-based housebuilder, however, gained Pounds 2.16m to Pounds 9.66m and the number of houses completed rose 24 per cent to 133. Gearing was reduced from 100 to 59 per cent thanks to the sale of Housecraft (Mexborough), the merchanting division. Earnings declined to 0.7p (2p) per share and the interim dividend is unchanged at 0.3p.</p>

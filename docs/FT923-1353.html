			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gloomy outlook for world sugar A GLOOMY outlook for world sugar prices emerged yesterday from two London commentators. ED &amp; F. Man, the London trade house, expects world sugar production in 1992-93 to hit record levels for the second consecutive year. Its first estimate for next season puts production at 116.95m tonnes, up 1.2m tonnes on 1991-92. Allowing for optimistic consumption figures, Man predicts a surplus of 3.44m tonnes next season, compared with a revised estimate of 4.77m tonnes this season. However, Man points out that this season has seen tight availability of raw sugar for export in spite of the large overall surplus. Next season, it expects the international trade surplus to be more evenly balanced between raw and white sugar. 'With a potential trade surplus of some 2.7m tonnes, lower prices are expected.' GNI, the London futures broker, yesterday suggested that nearby New York raw sugar prices could fall as low as 6 cents a lb. It cited bearish news of higher Thai exports; of large amounts of Argentinian sugar on offer which could provoke Brazil to defend its market share; and rumours of a price war between India and China. In late trading yesterday the New York March contract was 8.69 cents a lb.</p>

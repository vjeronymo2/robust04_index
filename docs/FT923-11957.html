			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Reuters Holdings For a company in the communications business, Reuters sets an extraordinarily bad example. It does not regard the price it is paying to buy out the minority interests in Visnews as material to its shareholders. It does not claim to know exactly how much investment will be required to build up its video news service. It offers only the vaguest of explanations as to where Pounds 15m in rationalisation costs went in the first half. And it does not see any need to disclose the transaction volumes on its newly-launched dealing systems. There is, however, no escaping the lacklustre indications underlying yesterday's announcement of a 10.2 per cent increase in interim profits. Higher interest income accounts for nearly two thirds of the advance and the company admits to disappointment on revenue growth. It has stopped surcharging customers for packaging new facilities into existing financial services and admits to doubts about when demand will be strong enough to permit resumption of this once lucrative pricing policy. It is thus legitimate to ask whether Reuters' heady growth of recent years is now history. Certainly, there cannot be much joy in selling banking products in Japan these days, or in the US, for that matter, where mergers are shrinking the market. The newest dealing products are off to an unexciting start. The thought occurs also that the managers who developed Reuters' great money-spinners like its Monitor service have long since moved on. Perhaps the Visnews announcement is trivial in itself and timed to distract attention from such worries. Perhaps it really is intended to add a significant new dimension to Reuters' news activities. That would make strategic sense. But it would also require heavy investment in a side of the business which has never distinguished itself in terms of margins or earnings growth. Whatever the answer, the shares look expensive on a running multiple just below 19.</p>

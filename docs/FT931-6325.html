			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Parliament to cost over Pounds 200m for the first time next year PARLIAMENT is to cost the taxpayer more than Pounds 200m for the first time next year, according to Treasury figures. Revised figures, to be published next week, will show that the total cost of the House of Commons and the House of Lords is Pounds 198m for 1992-93, including ministers' salaries, and is estimated to be Pounds 210m in the financial year beginning next month. This figure is based on cutting the salary bill by Pounds 3m, in ways which have not yet been decided, so could turn out to be higher. While the government is cracking down on public spending in every department, the parliamentary budget is one area over which ministers have little control. Treasury officials say the rise in the Commons budget for fees and salaries from Pounds 58m last year to Pounds 72m this year comes partly from an MPs' decision last summer to vote themselves a rise which took office costs allowances for each of them to almost Pounds 40,000 - above annual salaries. Spending on the House of Lords, including allowances for the 400 or so peers who regularly attend, is planned to rise from Pounds 36m this year to Pounds 41m next year, while spending on House of Commons administration is set to rise from Pounds 90m to Pounds 100m. Comparisons with previous years are difficult, because until recently costs such as printing or building work were concealed in other departments' budgets. But in 1979-80, the first year of the Thatcher government, the spending on Commons fees and salaries was Pounds 12.5m, while in 1992-93 the comparable figure is Pounds 72m - an increase of well over 450 per cent. Between 1979 and 1991, the retail price index rose by 136 per cent. However, taxpayers may feel they are getting value for money, at least in terms of effort; parliament sits for longer each year than many other legislatures.</p>

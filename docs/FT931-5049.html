			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / International Company News: Australia's Orbital reports firm orders for new type of car engine AUSTRALIA'S Orbital Engine Company has told the New York and Australian stock exchanges that it has won orders from 'a major automotive producer' for its innovative two-stroke engines. Ford, General Motors, Fiat and Volkswagen are among car makers already holding licences from Orbital to develop the technology. Orbital engines are around half the weight and two-thirds the size of conventional car engines. However, Ford, which has several dozen prototype Orbital-powered Fiestas in trial use with fleet operators in the UK - and is widely regarded as the front-runner for bringing Orbital cars to market - rejected speculation that it was involved in the announced agreement. Orbital, in which Broken Hill Proprietary has a 25 per cent stake, said it was prevented by a confidentiality agreement from naming the manufacturer which had signed the letter of intent. According to Orbital, the agreement provides for the vehicle maker initially to take supplies of OCP (Orbital Combustion Process) engines from a US plant being prepared by Orbital at a former GM facility in Tecumseh, Michigan, and which is due to come on stream at the end of this year. This will be complemented by an engineering programme at Orbital's research and development facilities at Perth, Western Australia. The rationale behind the Tecumseh plant is for it to provide licensees with only a sufficient volume of engines for them to gain know-how before committing to their own high-volume manufacture. Ford hopes to have small, Orbital-engined cars in its range by as early as 1995. The engines are said to be 10 per cent more powerful and 12 per cent more economical than conventional rivals.</p>

			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / International Company News: UAP head lowers profits forecast Mr Jacques Friedmann, chairman of Union des Assurances de Paris, the next candidate for privatisation by the French government, yesterday warned that the group's 1993 net profits were at the lower end of expectations at around FFr1.5bn (Dollars 250m). UAP, France's largest insurer and due within the next few weeks be sold off, had previously forecast net profits of between FFr1.5bn and FFr2bn for last year. However, Mr Friedmann, a senior bureaucrat andclose friend of Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, and who last autumn became chairman of UAP following the departure of Mr Jean Peyrelevade to the Credit Lyonnais banking group, told shareholders in Paris that its 1993 net profits would be 'in the region of FFr1.5bn'. UAP, like other French insurers, in recent years has been badly affected by the competitive state of the insurance market and by the impact of the economic recession on its property holdings and banking interests. One of its main problems has been the poor performance of Banque Worms, its loss-making banking subsidiary. Net profits peaked at FFr4.22bn in 1990, but fell to FFr3.77bn in 1991 and to FFr1.08bn in 1992. It has already reported a modest increase in interim net profits to FFr1.09bn for the first half of last year. However, UAP's recovery was checked in the closing months of 1993. 'The main problems seem to have been the performance of Banque Worms and the potential losses associated with the recent flooding in northern France,' said Mr Derek Elias, European insurance analyst at Paribas in London. Analysts are confident that UAP will see more robust profits growth this year, albeit to a total well below its 1990 and 1991 levels. Mr Elias said it should benefit from the recent rise in insurance premiums in France.</p>

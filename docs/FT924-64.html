			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Arts: The laws of time defied - Cinema in 1992 The Western is dead: long live Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven. The heyday of the animated feature was 40 years ago: enter Beauty And The Beast. Woody Allen stopped making side-splitting self-portraits with Annie Hall and Manhattan: welcome, Husbands And Wives. Cinema is exhilarating because you can never out-guess it. The art that earns its living by defying the laws of time - by re-enacting the past as an animated present - defies the clock in other ways. Just when you think a genre is 20 years past its resuscitate-by date (the Western), it jumps out from the morgue with six-guns firing. And just when you thought the Golden Age of feature cartoons was buried with Mr Walt Disney, Mr D's heirs perform a piece of necromancy that would have Walt himself applauding in wonder. If Unforgiven and Beauty And The Beast are top films in the Ghosts of Genres Past event, Woody Allen's Husbands And Wives proves the truth of a well-known Andrews proverb: Truth is stranger than fiction until fiction is given a proper chance to prove itself. Allen's comedy of splintering relationships is more cogent, more enthralling, more surprising, more merciless and (goodness knows) more funny than any of the real events relating to this year's most famous showbiz furore. 'Real,' of course, usually means as reported by the newspapers. And how real is that? Even I, unsaved by fact-checkers, once referred in an article to Woody's almost-fosterdaughter - she with whom he has been romantically involved - as Sun-Li. Should have been Soon-Yi. But there we go: facts turn to factoids with no malice aforethought. Which brings us to a second notable feature of 1992 in the cinema. What was historically real and what was not, and should we care? Christopher Columbus, a bisexual Italian Jew (not many of those characteristics got into the movies), bestrode the Atlantic in three different films. He was Gerard Depardieu, George Coraface and Jim Dale; and his story was celebrated for no better reason than that the sun had risen 1,825,000 times, not counting leap years, since the original Columbus crossed the Ocean in 1492. That was a trip that would lead ultimately to the discovery of Hollywood. And therein, doubtless, lay the film world's infatuation with this explorer. Columbus beached his landing boat in October 1492: the shudder in the sand engendering there Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Grauman's Chinese Theatre, the Walk Of Fame, Francis The Talking Mule, Greta Garbo, Charlie Chaplin . . . And let us stop there again. Of the two CCs who became raw feed for the year's bio-pic bonanza Chaplin could be called the real messiah of the American Dream, working for 40 years inside its very factory, and Columbus his several-centuries-before John the Baptist. The Columbus film-makers were clearly frustrated that they could not get their hero to California. So in the case of the best film, Ridley Scott's 1492: Conquest Of Paradise, they did the Hollywoodish next-best thing. They 'put on the show right there.' Part two of Scott's film was a wonderful visual extravaganza: a knees-up of the imagination that saw Columbus as a battered eco-hero before his time, at bay against savages noble and ignoble. The 'facts' wilted before the onslaught of thrillingly choreographed half-facts. No such luck or licence with Chaplin. The dominion of the checkable fact spreads across his whole life. So all Sir Richard Attenborough could do, apart from casting a charismatic curly-top from America as Charlie, was to have a framing device that nibbled at the edges of biographical record. (Anthony Hopkins played the hovering editor.) This raised an important question. If the cinema cannot play fast and loose with history, should it bother to play with it at all? Since the average bio-pic based on a recent-times subject cannot present any warts in its hero  -only Lux-clear complexions, it seems, will keep most filmgoers in their seats - perhaps we should insist that the form eschew subjects less than 100 years old. At that point the films usually feel free to demonise or mythologise, or at least to do justice to their subject's faults. If Chaplin felt inhibited by the freshness of history or the propinquity of Chaplin's surviving family, perhaps it should have waited until it did not. Not that 100-year rulings are needed with all films. Look at the strength that freedom with truth gave to some truth-based films: Bugsy, The Long Day Closes, Swoon, The Best Intentions, Husbands And Wives. Though none 'lied', all pushed, pounded and poeticised the facts until they turned to art. Bugsy was a dazzling free-form fresco of gangster life in Lotusland. Terence Davies's Liverpool auto-biopic, haunted by music and the movies, presented a childhood made mythic by memory. Tom Kallin's Swoon saw the Leopold-Loeb murder case through a shivered glass of new perspectives. And in The Best Intentions screenwriter Ingmar Bergman turned his parents' courtship and marriage into an epic of glowing Strindbergian power. Fidelity, whether to biographical truth or to literary text, is a pedant's virtue. At best, in adaptation movies like Howard's End and Glengarry Glen Ross, one admires the skill with which a film-maker holds the horses steady while a series of distinguished actors jump on their backs. Sometimes, too, fidelity is shocked into life by a blast-of-the-real as a story leaves printed page for great outdoors: as in Bruce Beresford's spectacular film of Brian Moore's Black Robe. But the year's best films have been those where framing constraints are so boldly breached that we feel, Columbus-like, that we are sailing to the edge of known aesthetic world. Husbands And Wives threw away the recent Allen style of join-the-dots psychodrama for a searingly funny cine-verite rampage. Unforgiven went far, and then went further, in unmasking the Old West as an place of barbarism. And Beauty And The Beast startled Disney observers by stretching the cartoon form to include not just state-of-the-art computer imaging but a strong-willed heroine for our feminist times. Disney has gone even further in its new Aladdin, just opened in the US, where the princess resembles some gangbusting female executive from Century City. Meanwhile from Europe three films - Rivette's portrait of an artist La Belle Noiseuse, Kieslowski's schizophrenic love story The Double Life Of Veronique and Lars Von Trier's neo-Gothic Euro-fable Europa - also took us on strange trips. The films resembled those unnerving taxi journeys where you know that you are being led the long way round but are soon mesmerised by seeing all the things you never saw before. Ten years ago we were all assailed with stories of the cinema's decrepitude. It was given six months to live by some, six hours by others. It still has ailments that should be cured: not least a self-referential fin de siecle narcissism already noted in these pages. But that the cinema will survive into the new millennium now seems beyond doubt. Here are ten good reasons why. Unforgiven, Beauty And The Beast, Husbands And Wives, La Belle Noiseuse, The Rapture, The Long Day Closes, Europa, The Double Life Of Veronique, Raise The Red Lantern, Black Robe.</p>

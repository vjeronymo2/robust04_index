			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / World Trade News: New Zealand to open meat export trade NEW ZEALAND is to allow competition in the export of meat to Europe, ending 30 years of dominance of the Dollars 150m-Dollars 180m annual trade by the British-led Conference Lines. The decision will particularly affect P &amp; O, which dominates the Conference Lines. Its 44,000 tonne container ships, specially developed for the trade, will not be able to use the smaller ports that expect to handle export meat to Europe. There will be far-reaching consequences also for New Zealand's four leading container ports, as well as the railways and road hauliers. The government aims to encourage ships to call at the ports nearest to processing plants, rather than fill containers and send them by rail or road to cities such as Auckland, now the biggest exporter of meat with 171,000 tonnes annually. Mr Brian Lynch of the Meat Industry Association hailed the decision as 'the biggest breath of fresh air to hit the industry for over 30 years.'</p>

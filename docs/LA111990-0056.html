			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> A CUTE, FUZZY LITTLE PROBLEM;  </P> <P> SQUIRRELS: THE DEBATE RAGES AT COLLEGE OF THE CANYONS AFTER AN ORDER TO REDUCE  THE CAMPUS'S POPULATION OF THE RODENTS, WHOSE FLEAS CAN TRANSMIT THE PLAGUE.  </P> <P> The squirrels seem harmless enough -- furry, little creatures, scurrying busily  across the College of the Canyons campus in search of nuts or food left by  their human friends. But look again.  </P> <P> Squirrels may have cornered the market on cute, but they carry fleas that are  potential carriers of plague, and Los Angeles County health officials have  ordered the Valencia college to get rid of some of the creatures. That mandate  has alarmed some COC students and animal rights activists, and left school  officials reluctantly searching for the best method to carry it out.  </P> <P> "I don't like killing animals any more than anyone else," said Cal Allsup, COC  facilities director. "But I fully understand that there's a problem and the  squirrels need to be suppressed."  </P> <P> Although some students and animal rights activists are opposed to killing any  squirrels, others are mostly concerned that it be done humanely.  </P> <P> County agriculture officials recommended killing the squirrels using the  chemicals Diazinon, diphacinone and aluminum phosphide. Diphacinone, an  anti-coagulant, dilutes the squirrels' blood so that it seeps out, causing them  to bleed to death.  </P> <P> Officials said the squirrels would probably return to their burrows to die but  that the bodies of those found aboveground would be disposed of immediately.  </P> <P> Some students and animal rights activists have proposed trapping the squirrels  and putting them to sleep painlessly. Better yet, the squirrels would not have  to be killed at all if they were sprayed with a chemical to eliminate the  fleas, they say.  </P> <P> Squirrels on the Valencia campus are as common as students, and their burrows  dot the hillsides and fields. Some are so tame "they'll actually come up and  take food out of people's hands," Allsup said.  </P> <P> The order to reduce the campus's large squirrel population was issued after a  routine inspection in September.  </P> <P> "Ground squirrels and the fleas that they carry are important in the  transmission of plague," said Franklin Hall, chief of the county Health  Services Department's vector-borne disease control program.  </P> <P> Squirrel eradication programs are common. "In recent years, there has been an  increase of plague occurring in wild rodents throughout Los Angeles County," he  said.  </P> <P> The fleas that live on the squirrels can carry sylvatic plague, Hall said. When  the squirrels come in contact with people or domestic animals, the insects can  be transmitted.  </P> <P> When contracted by people, the disease is known as bubonic plague, whose  symptoms include inflamed lymph glands, fever and delirium. The disease can  lead to death.  </P> <P> Although no squirrels examined on campus have been found to have fleas carrying  plague, the population still must be reduced as a precaution. "It's similar to  inoculating children for measles," Hall said. "We're taking the measures to  prevent something from occurring rather than waiting for it to occur."  </P> <P> Last week, the school's board of trustees allocated $5,000 for an eradication  program but did not decide what method should be used.  </P> <P> The plan proposed by the county agricultural commissioner has met with  opposition from some student activists and others.  </P> <P> "I think that we should look for and find the most humane and realistic method  possible to take care of the problem," said Michael Daly, a student. "I think  ideally we can find a solution where none of the squirrels have to be killed."  </P> <P> Daly and others have posted Save the Squirrels banners around campus and held  meetings to inform students and faculty members about the issue.  </P> <P> Community animal rights activist Kathleen Ungar said a suppression program was  unnecessary. "As far as I'm concerned, people overreacted," she said.  "Everyone's just guessing" that the squirrels might carry the disease.  </P> <P> Daly has expressed concern that the chemicals suggested for use may also harm  people or animals that eat the poisoned squirrels.  </P> <P> Sentiment on campus ranges from apathy to adamant support.  </P> <P> Even before the health department mandate, the squirrels kept groundskeepers  busy. Workers constantly refill holes made on athletic fields by squirrels.  Allsup said squirrels have even caused structural damage to buildings by  burrowing underneath.  </P> <P> "I say, 'Kill 'em,' " said Jim Blankenship, a natural resources major. "I'm an  environmentalist and all that, but they're undermining the grounds."  </P> <P> But other students disagree, just as adamantly.  </P> <P> "I don't think they need to suppress them at all," said Shannon Stark, 19. "We  took their area. We destroyed their home, basically, so where else are they  going to live? They're just trying to survive."  </P> <P> College of the Canyons is all too familiar with animal controversies.  </P> <P> Four years ago, college officials attempted to rid the campus of swallows  roosting on the ledges over the entrance to the campus's main building.  </P> <P> Officials tried driving them off with gooey repellents, sonic beepers and  high-powered water hoses. Nothing seemed to work and six of the birds, which  are a protected species, were killed in the attempts.  </P> <P> Since 1987, however, the school seems to have learned to live with the birds  and now even has a festival celebrating their annual return.  </P> <P> "The student community and faculty at COC realize the value of having the  swallows come home to their college, and now I would like to see the squirrels  given the same respect," Ungar said. "If we can save the swallows, we can save  the squirrels."  </P> <P> Although the swallows and squirrels are a cause celebre on campus, officials  have been killing gophers for years without causing an outcry from students or  community animal rights activists.  </P> <P> "People aren't concerned about the gophers because gophers are ugly things,"  Allsup said. "They look like rats."  </P></p>

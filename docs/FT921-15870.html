			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Ford to export Mazda-made cars to Japan and Britain FORD, the second largest US car maker, is to export Ford-badged right-hand drive vehicles to Japan and the UK, the world's biggest right-hand drive car markets, for the first time since the early 1900s. It said yesterday that a right-hand drive version of the new generation Ford Probe, a sporty coupe due for launch in the US in mid-1992, would be built in the US for export from autumn 1993. Ironically, the Ford Probe is built at the Michigan assembly plant of Mazda, Ford's Japanese affiliate in which it holds a 25 per cent stake. The Probe is a Ford-derived version of the Mazda MX-6 coupe. Mr Allan Gilmour, president of Ford's automotive operations, said that the right-hand drive version of the Probe, would be 'merely the beginning of a series of vehicles built in America that will be exportable to right-hand drive markets.' Historically Ford and other US car makers, have chosen to manufacture vehicles locally around the world, but Mr Gilmour said that the convergence of product concepts and technologies meant that Ford was planning to produce in the US a 'greater variety of right-hand drive products for Japan and the UK.' The introduction of the Ford Probe to the UK will be welcomed by Ford's hard-pressed British dealers, which are suffering in part from the lack of a sporty coupe in their range to rival the successful Vauxhall Calibra. Ford has lacked a coupe in Europe since it stopped production of the Ford Capri in 1987. Japanese car producers last year increased further their share of US car sales, adding to mounting US-Japanese trade frictions. Their advance came as US new car sales fell by 12 per cent to 8.2m, the fourth decline in five years and the lowest level since 1982. With the recession in the US car market deepening the big three US car makers - General Motors, Ford and Chrysler - all suffered heavy losses. The chairmen of the big three are accompanying President George Bush on his visit to Japan this week. Japanese-badged cars captured 31 per cent of the US new car market last year, compared with 28 per cent a year earlier. For the first time Chrysler, the smallest of the big three, was overtaken by two Japanese producers and was relegated to fifth place.

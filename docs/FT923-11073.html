			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Rome considering new tax incentives ITALY'S government may be about to introduce new tax incentives to encourage private investors to buy shares to smooth the path of its planned privatisation programme. Mr Giovanni Goria, finance minister, called on stockbrokers for 'a few more days of patience, then the measures to support the bourse will arrive'. He gave no details of the items being considered. However, bankers believe a suspension, or possible abolition, of the country's relatively new capital gains tax on equity dealings may be among the priorities. Some also think the government might be considering a new law, similar to France's Loi Monory, offering private investors tax incentives to purchase equities. Any measures to encourage share buying would have to be modest, in order not to divert private savings out of funding the budget deficit. Private investors are currently the main buyers of short-term Treasury bills, which have traditionally been given tax advantages over equities in order to siphon investors' savings into covering the deficit. Suspending capital gains tax, which was revised three times before finally being introduced last year, would be popular on the bourse. Brokers say the tax, which has produced only modest receipts for the Treasury, has had a substantial impact on sentiment towards equities. Last week was one of the most dismal in the history of the Milan stock market, with the Comit share index falling to its lowest level since late 1986. After plunging on Monday after the Mafia murder of a leading judge, equities continued to slip on the back of sinking confidence in the domestic economy and corporate profits. However, a lively stock-market is one of the pre-requisites for the plans of Mr Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, for a large-scale privatisation programme. Although shares in public-sector companies will be sold internationally, the domestic market will be expected to absorb a substantial proportion of the equity on offer.</p>

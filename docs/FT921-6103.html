			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Clearer issues at Mideast talks: How US-Israel relations dominate the peace process THE FOURTH round of bilateral Middle East peace talks broke for the weekend yesterday following another week of recrimination and accusations in Washington, with progress on substance remaining elusive but the immediate issues and negotiating tactics becoming clearer. From the moment President George Bush and Mr James Baker, the secretary of state, decided to launch a new peace initiative in the wake of the Gulf war it was almost certain that its fate would be decided by the evolution of relations between Israel and the US, its foremost financial, military and diplomatic supporter. Events in Washington this week have underscored how critical the relations between the two governments have become and how the Israeli public will be given a decisive role in the peace process at the June 23 general election. Officials in Washington make little effort to disguise their belief that Mr Bush and Mr Baker have, in effect, given up on Mr Yitzhak Shamir, Israel's prime minister. Last Monday offered additional evidence. In the morning Mr Baker announced that the US would not provide loan guarantees of Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.7bn) to help settle immigrants from the Soviet Union unless Israel first stopped building new settlements on the Arab territory it has occupied since 1967. Later that day Israel submitted to the Palestinians a plan for an interim self-governing arrangement in those territories. Without a strongly restraining American arm, the proposals could have provoked an Arab walkout. Not only did the plan insist that the Palestinians must accept the right of unlimited numbers of Jews to live and continue to settle in the West Bank and Gaza, but was also far more restrictive than Israeli proposals tabled more than 10 years ago. It could be interpreted as a hardline negotiating stance, but Mr Zalman Shoval, Israel's ambassador to Washington, saw fit to describe the scheme as generous. The bitter response by Mr Shamir and some of his ministers to the US announcement on loan guarantees has done nothing to help the Israeli case in Washington. The famed power of the Jewish lobby has been little in evidence, the media has been generally supportive of the administration's action and there is growing fear among friends of Israel that Mr Shamir is in danger of inflicting lasting damage on a relationship that has done more than any other to sustain Israel over the past 40 years. With even the majority of Israelis opposed to new settlements in the occupied territories, the US administration has no problem in convincing its own public of the correctness of a policy it has followed for 25 years. Mr Baker repeats the total US commitment to Israel's security, but argues that it will not be enhanced by providing loan guarantees of Dollars 10bn in addition to the Dollars 3bn-Dollars 4bn that Israel already receives annually from the US. It is an argument well received by an American public that is increasingly critical of US foreign aid levels, especially now the threat of communism has all but been eliminated. And it is an issue on which, not unexpectedly, the Arab delegations like to dwell. While the Palestinians, Syrians, Jordanians and Lebanese have little tangible to demonstrate from their presence in Washington, they are none the less broadly playing the game scripted for them by the US. That is: to remain patient and calm, and to appear reasonable in their demands. The key issue for them is how long they can keep justifying this attitude back home where, particularly in the occupied territories, new facts are being created by Israel every day. But while they remain on board they have an almost daily opportunity to put to the American public their own case, which is beginning to sound rather close to the US administration's. For that reason alone Israel is again demanding that the next round of talks should be moved out of the US. But the main unadmitted carrot dangling in front of most people involved in the negotiations is the possibility that Mr Yitzhak Rabin's Labour Party might beat the Likud of Mr Shamir in the Israeli elections. Mr Rabin has promised to stop building settlements in the occupied territories and favours exchanging some part of that land in return for full peace. Voting for him can be presented as not only assisting the peace process but opening the door to the loans needed to settle new immigrants in Israel proper. It could also transform the atmosphere at the peace talks. But it would not all be to the Arab advantage. The delegations are working well together precisely because there is nothing on the table. The moment Israel makes more interesting proposals will be when latent tensions begin to surface within and between the Arab partners.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague May 12 (CTK) -- The Czech-Slovenian free  zone agreement will be ratified by parliament as soon as  possible, Parliament Chairman Milan Uhde said today at his  meeting with Slovenian Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle.    The agreement was signed in Ljubljana on December 4, 1993.    Peterle and Uhde pointed to the dynamically-growing  relations  between the two countries.    Peterle said at the meeting that no open problems existed  between the two countries and described the Czech Republic as a  friendly country with strategic importance to Slovenia, for  which the Czech Republic is the most important partner.    He said that Slovenia and the Czech Republic shared views on  entering the European Union as sovereign countries wanting to  share in the making of Europe.    Uhde criticised attempts at dividing Europe into spheres of  interest. Peterle said that the idea "leads to  Bosnia-Herzegovina," adding that if particular pressures had not  been at play there, the country's problems would have been  solved a long time ago.    "We want a Europe and not a package of interest spheres,"  Peterle added.</p>

			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Granada director gets 17% pay rise Mr Gerry Robinson, the chief executive of Granada, now locked in a hostile takeover bid for London Weekend Television, received a healthy pay increase of more than 17 per cent this year. Mr Robinson's remuneration rose in the year to October from Pounds 346,000 to Pounds 407,000, making him by far the highest paid director. In the 12 months, the television, rental, leisure and computer services group achieved a better than expected 53 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 176m on turnover of Pounds 1.6bn. Mr Alex Bernstein, Granada's chairman, actually received a substantial pay cut from Pounds 267,000 to Pounds 169,000. This reflects the arrival of Mr Robinson and the fact that as a result, Mr Bernstein is not working as many hours at the company as he used to. Mr Robinson holds 299,172 shares in the company and has options on a further 737,500. At LWT, which is resisting a Granada offer valuing the company at more than Pounds 600m, directors and management own about 10 per cent of the company, following a share scheme put in place before the competitive tenders for new ITV licences.</p>

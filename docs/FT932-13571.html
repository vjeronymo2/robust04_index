			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US markets search for a new direction Wall Street US MARKETS lay dormant yesterday as investors searched in vain for a lead from bond prices and first-quarter corporate earnings, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 4.05 at 3,439.44, having spent most of the day only a few points either side of the opening level. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 eased 1.47 to 443.63, while the American SE composite was 1.62 firmer at 419.03 and the Nasdaq composite 2.07 higher at 664.04. NYSE trading volume came to 286m shares. After two days of losses, the stock markets struggled to hold prices in positive territory yesterday. In spite of Monday's and Tuesday's declines, sentiment is not particularly bearish - the problem is that there are few reasons to buy stocks at the moment. Bond yields have fallen in the past week, but they were only retrieving lost ground, and there is no indication that they will fall much further. As for the quarterly reports, a few stocks have been boosted by unexpectedly good earnings, but most seem to have had good news on profits already built into the price. Consequently, there has been a lot of profit-taking in recent days, and much shifting of funds in and out of various industry groups as investors search for the sector holding the most promise for quick gains. Bank and airline shares were affected by this switching yesterday. Bank stocks, which have had a good 1993 so far on expectations of improved profitability, have been overrun by profit-takers lately, in spite of good first-quarter earnings announcements. Among those that suffered yesterday were JP Morgan, down Dollars 2 1/8 at Dollars 69 7/8, BankAmerica, Dollars 1 1/8 lower at Dollars 49 1/8, Banc One, off Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 56 5/8, and First Union, Dollars 1 3/4 cheaper at Dollars 46 7/8. In contrast, airline issues bounced back strongly from recent selling on fears of a renewal of the air fares war. They were aided by news of improved operating earnings at AMR, parent of American Airlines. AMR climbed Dollars 6 to Dollars 72, UAL jumped Dollars 9 3/4 to Dollars 149 3/4, USAir put on Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 24 1/4 and Delta added Dollars 2 3/4 at Dollars 59 1/4. AT&amp;T dipped Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 57 3/8 in volume of 2m shares after the telecommunications group announced a first-quarter loss of Dollars 4.19 a share, compared with a profit of 67 cents a share a year earlier. General Dynamics firmed Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 97 1/8 after the aerospace and defence group unveiled first-quarter net income on continuing operations of Dollars 1.30 a share, more than double the earnings of a year ago. On the Nasdaq market, Borland International rose Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 23 on news of its alliance with WordPerfect to produce personal computer software. Canada THE Toronto market showed little overall change for the second consecutive day, in continued heavy trading. The TSE 300 Index rose just 0.5 to 3,663.8 and advances led declines by 352 to 317 after volume of 73.1m shares valued at CDollars 664m. Eight of the 14 stock groups ended higher, with the biggest gains recorded by real estate, transportation and energy, up 1.71 per cent, 1.38 per cent and 1.13 per cent respectively.</p>

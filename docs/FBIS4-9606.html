			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 28 Apr--During Thursday's talks between  Industry and Trade Minister Marek Pol and the striking lignite  miners, the unionists submitted their six demands. Three of  these are of a nationwide nature; the other three apply to their  branch of industry. The sides discussed demands put forward by  industry branches as well as a timetable for further talks.    Late in the evening, following a meeting with Solidarity  leader Marian Krzaklewski, the miners demanded that a fixed date  be given for the coming into force of the Enterprise Pact.    Following Minister Pol's 26 April decision to cancel the  restructuring of the lignite mining industry, the miners  promised that they will deliver enough coal to power stations  before 2000 on Thursday so that they will be able to generate  power to about one-third of their total capacity. If the  government fails to present a timetable for the implementation  of Solidarity demands after that time, the unionists have warned  that protest action will escalate.    Miners striking in the Belchatow and Turow mines have been  delivering coal in the quantities agreed upon Tuesday, while  awaiting the outcome of talks held in Konin, PAP correspondents  were told on at 2200 on Thursday.</p>

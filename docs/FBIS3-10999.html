			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] La Paz, 13 Dec (EFE) -- Various politicians said  today that former Bolivian President Luis Garcia Meza, who was  detained in Brazil, could involve many of the active members of  Bolivian politics in the actions of his de facto government  (1980-1981) for which he was sentenced to 30 years in prison.    Deputy Benjamin Miguel of the Christian Democratic Party  (PDC) said today that Garcia Meza is quite "smart to do that ...  to try to stain with his accusations many people who now appear  to be democrats and respectful of the Constitution but who  encouraged the military dictatorships."    Garcia Meza, who was detained on 11 March by Brazilian  police  in Sao Paulo, said: "I am paying for the things others did and  I will prove it."    Deputy Miguel, who lived in exile during the Garcia Meza  government, said, "the former dictator has nothing to lose" and  he will try to get the greatest political advantage from his  declarations before and after he is extradited to Bolivia.    The La Paz morning daily HOY says in an editorial on 12  March  that there is "fear of Garcia Meza," and that "this time the  people are not the ones who are afraid of this character, but  his old allies and Bolivian politicians who are about to get  another bucket of water" from the former dictator.    Juan del Granado, a lawyer in the civic lawsuit of the  so-called "Trial of the Century" against Garcia Meza that lasted  seven years, labeled the former dictator a "liar and forgetful."  He said, however, that whatever Garcia Meza says will serve to  open the case again against new people who were involved in the  criminals acts committed by the former general.    Miguel Urioste, leader of the Free Bolivia Movement (MBL)  that is in the government coalition, said that "the two previous  governments protected the former dictator" in reference to  former President Victor Paz Estenssoro (1985-1989) and Jaime Paz  Zamora (1989-1993). The first because it let him go and the  second because it did not want to arrest him.    Urioste added: "I hope Garcia Meza is man enough to accuse  his accomplices, accessories, and protectors, and that the heads  that must roll begin to roll."    The MBL announced that it will propose in the next few days  that the Constitution, Justice, and Judicial Police Committee of  the Chamber of Deputies investigate the protection given to  Garcia Meza by people linked to current Bolivian politics and  diplomacy.    Deputy Eduardo Paz of the opposition Conscience of the  Fatherland (Condepa) said that all those who cooperated with the  Garcia Meza government should be "unmasked." He supports any  initiative to identify the former dictator's accessories during  the five years he remained a fugitive from justice.    According to a "confidential" report released by the local  FIDES news agency, more than 100 people have covered up for  Garcia Meza in Bolivia including soldiers, congressmen, close  friends, relatives, and people who benefited in administrative  and political positions during the de facto government from July  1980 to August 1981.    The Bolivian Supreme Court sentenced Garcia Meza on 21 April  1993 to the stiffest sentence, 30 years in jail, for nine crimes  of sedition, murder, malfeasance, and stealing government  property.</p>

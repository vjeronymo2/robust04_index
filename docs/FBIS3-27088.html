Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of XINHUA news agency Hong  Kong branch, made these remarks in response to reporters'  questions about Patten's on-going Australia visit at a spring  cocktail reception here this evening.    "This is not the first time for Patten to play international  cards. He did so as early as in 1992," Zhang said.    He reiterated that the Hong Kong issue should be studied and  discussed only between China and Britain and no third country  has the right to interfere in Hong Kong's affairs.    "We maintain that China and Britain should cooperate in  handling affairs such as elections during the transitional  period, but the British side refused to cooperate and the  Sino-British negotiations have subsequently broken down," Zhang  said.    Without agreements between China and Britain, the three-tier  councils will all be terminated on June 30, 1997, and be  reorganized, the deputy director added.</p>

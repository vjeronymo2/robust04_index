			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORTHWEST PASADENA SAID SHORTCHANGED  </P> <P> The plan launched five years ago to revitalize the mostly minority  neighborhoods of Northwest Pasadena has not been properly funded, and no  substantive gains have been made, according to a report presented Tuesday to  the Board of Directors by a city advisory committee.  </P> <P> The 13-member Northwest Task Force, which has been studying the Northwest Plan  for the last eight months, stated in its report that the plan is a sound  concept designed to enhance human services, housing and economic development  for what long has been a neglected corner of town.  </P> <P> But a lack of clear priorities and the failure to come up with a proposed $35  million to implement the plan doomed it from the start, the report concluded.  </P> <P> "We find the Northwest Plan was undone and under-finished," said the task  force's chairwoman, Melba Guy. "The city has failed to bring the Northwest into  the mainstream of Pasadena life."  </P> <P> City Manager Donald McIntyre, who task force members contended should be held  accountable for the failure, said he is preparing a formal response to the  report.  </P> <P> "It's very critical, and perhaps, most of that is appropriate," McIntyre said.  </P> <P> Although the plan originally was hailed as a $35-million infusion into  Northwest Pasadena, which is home to about one-third of the city's residents, a  budget shortfall quickly trimmed that figure by about $10 million. Of the  remaining $25 million, much came from grants that would have been allocated to  the Northwest even if there had been no plan, said the report.  </P> <P> "There has to be a better sensitizing to just how important this is," City  Director Chris Holden said. "If we don't give it that kind of commitment, what  you ultimately end up with is a sham."  </P></p>

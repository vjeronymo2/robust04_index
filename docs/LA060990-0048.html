			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'PARADISE' LOST  </P> <P> The Times failed to report in its May 30 story on the CBS fall schedule that  the series "Paradise" did not make the cut. We are saddened by its departure,  for it presented a new look at the Old West.  </P> <P> The themes of "Paradise" were not your usual Western fare: a feared gunfighter  struggling to adjust to domestic life and fatherhood; mine owners trading in  opium to keep Chinese workers in line; a respected judge being exposed as a  wife-beater; fear and discrimination against a mentally disabled person that  almost led to his execution; a killer turned preacher.  </P> <P> "Paradise" also was the only TV series to present a recurring positive  portrayal of a youngster, wonderfully played by 10-year-old actor Brian Lando,  who was coping very well with a slight stuttering speech disability.  </P> <P> That is why we will be awarding "Paradise" (Lorimar Television, co-creators  David Jacobs and Robert Porter and actor Lando) our first "Golden Block" award.  </P> <P> IRA ZIMMERMAN  </P> <P> Media Relations Coordinator  </P> <P> The National Stuttering Project  </P> <P> San Juan Capistrano  </P></p>

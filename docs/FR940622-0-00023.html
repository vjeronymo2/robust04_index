			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Responsibilities of Medicare Participating Hospitals in Emergency Cases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Hospitals that choose to participate in the Medicare program agree in writing to meet various requirements included in section 1866 of the Social Security Act (the Act). Before enactment of COBRA on April 7, 1986, the Act did not specifically address the issue of how hospitals with emergency medical departments must handle individuals who have emergency medical conditions or who are in labor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In its Report accompanying H.R. 3128, the House Ways and Means Committee indicated that Congress was concerned about the increasing number of reports that hospital emergency rooms were refusing to accept or treat individuals with emergency conditions if the patients did not have medical insurance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the Report stated that there were reports that individuals in an unstable condition were transferred improperly, sometimes without the consent of the receiving hospital. Because Congress believed that this situation may have worsened since the Medicare prospective payment system for hospitals became effective, the Report stated that the Committee ``wants to provide a strong assurance that pressures for greater hospital efficiency are not to be construed as license to ignore traditional community responsibilities and loosen historic standards.'' (H.R. Rep. No. 99&hyph;241, 99th Cong., 1st Sess. 27 (1985).) Subsequently, section 9121 of COBRA, sections 6003(g)(3)(D)(XIV), 6018, and 6211 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (OBRA 89), Pub. L. 101&hyph;239, and sections 4008(b), 4027(a), and 4027(k)(3) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA 90), Pub. L. 101&hyph;508, have all addressed this concern.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Legislation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Participation in CHAMPUS and CHAMPVA Programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 9122 of COBRA amended section 1866(a)(1) of the Act by adding a new paragraph (J), which requires hospitals in the Medicare program to be participating providers of medical care, for inpatient services only, under any health plan contracted for under 10 U.S.C. 1079 or 1086 (CHAMPUS) or under 38 U.S.C. 613 (CHAMPVA), in accordance with admission practices and payment methodology and amounts as prescribed under joint regulations issued by the Secretaries of Health and Human Services, Defense, and Transportation. This requirement applies to services furnished to CHAMPUS and CHAMPVA beneficiaries admitted on or after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 1, 1987.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Section 9122 of COBRA also required that the legislation apply to all agreements entered into on or after April 7, 1986, but this requirement was deleted by section 1895(b)(6) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99&hyph;514), enacted October 22, 1986.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Participation in the Veterans Administration Health Care Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 233 of the Veterans' Benefit Improvement and Health-Care Authorization Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99&hyph;576) was enacted on October 28, 1986. It added a new paragraph (L) to section 1866 (a)(1) of the Act. It requires hospitals that participate in Medicare to be participating providers under 38 U.S.C. 603, in accordance with the admissions practices, and payment methodology and amounts, prescribed under joint regulations issued to implement this section by the Secretary of HHS and the Administrator of the VA. This provision applies to services furnished to veterans admitted on or after July 1, 1987.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Statement of Beneficiary Rights  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 9305(b)(1) of OBRA 86, which was enacted on October 21, 1986, added a new paragraph (M) to section 1866(a)(1) of the Act. That paragraph requires a hospital that is eligible to participate in the Medicare program to agree to furnish a beneficiary, or an individual acting on his or her behalf, at or about the time of admission, with a written statement of the beneficiary's discharge rights. The statement must explain:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) The individual's rights to benefits for inpatient hospital services and for posthospital services under Medicare;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The circumstances under which the individual will and will not be liable for charges for continued stay in the hospital;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The individual's right to appeal denials of benefits for continued inpatient hospital services, including the practical steps to initiate the appeal;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) The individual's liability for services if the denial of benefits is upheld on appeal; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Additional information that the Secretary specifies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 9305(b)(2) of OBRA 86 requires that we prescribe the language to be used in the statement not later than 6 months after the effective date of OBRA 86. After development of the revised language for the statement required under OBRA 86, the hospitals must comply with the requirement to give the revised statement to beneficiaries upon admission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D.

			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> LAWSUITS CHALLENGE PROJECT ON PIKE SITE  </P> <P> Two citizens groups have filed lawsuits challenging the city's approval of a  massive shoreline development project on the site of the old Pike Amusement  Park, claiming city officials have paid scant heed to traffic and air pollution  problems associated with the $1-billion project.  </P> <P> The lawsuits, filed in Superior Court in Los Angeles, assert that the city's  environmental impact report fails to fully address the development's  environmental problems or ways of alleviating them. The housing association  also claims the upscale, mixed-use Pike development is ignoring a critical need  for more affordable housing in Long Beach.  </P></p>

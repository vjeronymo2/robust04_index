			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / How To Spend It: Great ideas for happier holidays - Lucia van der Post selects nifty gadgets for stylish travelling IT'S holiday time. Time for quick get-aways, time to get wised-up on the essentials for happy travelling. Here are just a few of the best new travel ideas. Homeway &amp; Downpour sells a small range of very useful travelling accessories  -some, such as the picnic rug and the acrylic picnicware, are widely available, but a few genuinely useful items are not so easy to track down. The Pack-a-Bags, for instance, are a series of roll packs with strong, zipped see-through compartments in which things such as medicines, suncare products, toiletries and the like can be kept. They can either be bought empty and filled with whatever you deem to be essential or, for the lazy or the very busy, there is a series of ready-filled packs. These hold the usual holiday emergency items - sting relief creams, insect repellents, plasters, thermometers, paracetamol et al  -but for those travelling to countries where medical standards may be in doubt there is a Sterile Medical Pack (Pounds 9.15) which includes syringes, needles, disposable gloves and other useful things in cases of medical emergency. Write to Homeway &amp; Downpour, The White House, Littleton, Winchester, Hampshire SO22 6QS or tel: 0962 - 881526 for a leaflet. Fun swimming caps - otters, alligators, sharks, frogs, dolphins, turtles or seals - cost Pounds 12.95 each from The Leading Edge, Harrods, Knightsbridge, London SW1. For the climbing, diving, adventurous sort the Minolta Weathermatic is a completely waterproof and shockproof camera - take it water or snow skiing, yachting, pot-holing, scuba-diving, parachuting. It costs Pounds 199.95. If you want a camera with a zoom the Pentax WeatherZoom (Pounds 229.99) has a 38-90 mm power zoom, is compact and though not completely waterproof it is weather resistant and will not give up on you if it gets splashed. International beauties swear by Flight Age Cream, a moisturiser to keep the skin well lubricated while flying in dry aircraft cabins. Pounds 30 from prescriptives counters. If you cannot bear to miss the latest from the Olympics, the Oval or Goodwood, then Casio's palm-sized TV-7 may be just the thing. Small enough to fit into a large shirt pocket (3 ins by 1 ins by 4 1/2 ins) it has a built-in aerial and a socket for an external aerial. Pounds 129.99. Long journeys with small children can be hell - try keeping them quiet with cassettes from Travellers' Tales. There are more than 1,000 titles ranging from Black Beauty to The Hobbit, from thrillers (Peter Cheyney, Agatha Christie, Conan Doyle) to all-time classics. Six tapes can be hired for one week for Pounds 6, eight for Pounds 8 and after the first week the charge is 6p per tape, per day. Annual membership costs Pounds 20, lifetime membership, Pounds 100. Useful not just for keeping the kids quiet but also for those who often have to drive long distances. Write to Travellers' Tales, Great Weddington, Ash, Canterbury, Kent CT3 2AR (tel: 0304-812531) for details.</p>

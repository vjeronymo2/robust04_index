Korean Workers' Struggle for Right to Existence </F> Supported" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, March 23 (KCNA) -- The spring action of  workers for a wage hike in South Korea is a just struggle for  the elementary right to existence, says MINJU CHOSON in a  commentary today.    Noting that workers employed by comprador businesses in  Seoul, Pusan and other areas are waging a struggle, shouting  such slogans as "The Authorities' Wage-Curbing Policy Is a  Policy Killing Workers" and "Increase Wages", the news analyst  says:    Their demand for a higher wage is a demand for a reward for  their labour and for the right and conditions for a life  befitting humanity.    Nevertheless, the Kim Yong-sam clique is trying to pacify  the  workers in their just struggle to be paid for their labour,  urging them to "share hardships" and "restrain their demand,"  while insulting their struggle as "collective egoism" and an  "illegal act" and, furthermore, blackmailing them by invoking  the fascist "emergency arbitration power", which had not been  used even in the "Fifth and Sixth Republics", threatening "a  tough countermeasure".    But no suppression can block the workers' struggle.    The South Korean workers have no more room to step backward  from the present life of barest subsistence.</p>

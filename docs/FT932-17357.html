			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Arts: Artist's block - Cinema THE QUINCE TREE SUN (U) Victor Erice THE SILENT TOUCH (15) Krzysztof Zanussi USED PEOPLE (12) Beeban Kidron NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (18) Tom Savini SPLITTING HEIRS (12) Robert Young MR NANNY (PG) Michael Gottlieb Artists are funny people. Put a pen or brush in their hands and they either bend to their task with monkish devotion (painter Antonio Lopez in Victor Erice's The Quince Tree Sun) or throw tantrums, empty whisky bottles and impregnate their secretaries (composer Max Von Sydow in Krzysztof Zanussi's The Silent Touch). Of the two options, neither guarantees a good time for the spectator. But of the two films both have major curiosity value. Erice's is a Spanish TV documentary that sprouted wings and became a Cannes prize-winning feature. And Zanussi's is a Euro-pudding that plunges earthward only after some fiery, spirit-soaked mumming from Von Sydow. The star of The Quince Tree Sun is the quince tree. Standing in the dusty backyard of Senor Lopez, a real Madrid artist, it beckons his paintbrush. For 2 1/4 hours we watch him fail to complete the canvas that is his main work one wet autumn. Though rain stops paint, it does not deter the film's sense of near-religious eventlessness. Lopez lives on bread, air and the odd glass of Spanish plonk. In and out of his life wander a dog, a wife, two daughters, a painter friend and a Chinese visitor. And there are shots of nearby apartment-block windows, of a rail-line, of Mrs Lopez pottering or herself painting. She is working on a picture of Mr Lopez prone on a bed, his sole recreation away from the quince tree. The film is fascinating: but not for the reason its admirers proclaim. They see an affirmative fable of spiritual and artistic struggle as the film-maker watches the painter work out his subject. Lopez suspends plumblines and paints white check-marks on the leaves to ensure the consistency of the image in face of the capriciousness of Nature. But I am not in the uplifting masterpiece camp. The film fascinates because it embodies the struggle it depicts: it has Nothing To Say and yet says it with a crazed, anomic majesty. Erice is no stranger to minimalism. But where his first film The Spirit Of The Beehive was about the mysteries of growing up in a world of opaque and sinister mysticism - it had a sense of progress, however pained and slow - The Quince Tree Sun is a cinematic cul-de-sac pretending to be a through-road. An absurd artistic task - who needs mathematical pictures of fruit trees? - is absurdly apotheosised, right up to its absurd quietus. The occasional spurt of beauty or serendipitous insight makes the experience more poignant, more tantalising. For inspiration under siege is both the subject of The Quince Tree Sun and the style of its making. It is also the reason we are drawn to Max Von Sydow's crusty Danish composer in The Silent Touch. Wrestling with an uncompliant muse, the only notes Sydow has composed in 40 years are to the milkman. Now he lives in a country mansion with wife Sarah Miles. He is a moody mage wrapped in winter rugs until Polish student Lothaire Bluteau (Jesus of Montreal) bursts into their peace. Bluteau can water-divine; he can heal by the 'silent touch' of hands; and he can re-animate, he claims, Von S's creative juices. Polish director Krzysztof Zanussi has dealt before - and better - with the self-destruct energies of the human mind and imagination. See Illumination and Camouflage. For The Silent Touch, first fruit of a new European Co-production Fund, his original story idea has been hijacked by two English writers, Peter Morgan and Mark Wadlow. A tale that should fly through strange high-altitude corridors known only to KZ is instead forced to make for Banality Airport, where everybody speaks the same language (Euro-English) and stars from different countries can gather in the VIP lounge. When not enacting the timeless drama of the Impossible Genius - Von Sydow beds everything on two legs, including his nubile new secretary, and breaks everything else - the film plods through its over-schemed, quasi-Faustian transference-of-creativity scenario between student and genius. The confrontations are stagey and the dialogue is by hot-air speech balloon. Thank heaven then for Mad Max. The Swedish actor chews his role as if it were the sourest Hesperidean apple. At times he spits out bits he does not like; at others he fills his mouth with noises of pagan, guttural relish. If we must have the art movie as Euro-bathos, let us at least have a Euro-star making a meal of things at the centre. ***** The giant moon that hovered over Moonstruck has been re-hired for Used People. Its presence indicates that rooftop yearnings from New York's ethnic community will loom large and so will bitter-sweet melancholy. 'Life's tough, so laugh a little' insists the moon-bathed poster. So we do: at this likable, oldfashioned, sentimental - let us face it, creaky - comedy about second-chancers. Second-chancers are mature people who, cheated by life to date, suddenly turn around and order life to pay recompense. Thus Shirley MacLaine, a sixtyish Jewish widow from Queens who has spent too long washing dishes and raising children, accepts it when Marcello Mastroianni, an Italian roue dressed in 1930s-era 'Anyone for Venice' clothes, kindles the first spark of romance at her husband's funeral party. Self-liberation soon spreads virus-like through the family. Homebound grandma Jessica Tandy just might buzz off to Florida with best friend Sylvia Sidney. And MacLaine's daughters, frumpish Kathy Bates and neurotic beauty Marcia Gay Harden (her young son already a psychiatric couch-case), just might make a respective dash for glamour and responsible motherhood. Todd Graff's screenplay spreads in all directions like an overturned syrup tin. But British director Beeban Kidron (of TV's Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit) moves essential household objects into position - spaghetti pans, double-beds, televisions broadcasting the first moon landing - to corral the schmaltz. A wry, gawky domestic everydayness stands guard over the escape-prone whimsy. So does a first-class cast. Invidious to pick out one member, so I will. Shirley MacLaine: for crackerjack acting and for having the nerve to look 60, at least until her wedding day when the make-up men hitch up her cheeks and cameraman David Watkin puts about 28 gauzes (my count) between her and the softly focused camera. In Night Of The Living Dead no one gets the soft-focus treatment. Worse, a professional make-up man has escaped and is running amok across the country. George Romero's 1968 zombie classic is here remade in colour by Tom Savini, cosmetician on the earlier film. Savini shreds our nerves with a razor-sharp replay of Romero's opening scene: the graveyard ghouls lumbering forth in broad daylight to terrify the heroine and KO her brother. Then the film battles bravely against dwindling returns, as we movie into the all-colour bloodbath in the zombie-besieged farmhouse. Savini's hopping camera and Romero's own no-nonsense script ensure few lulls in energy. But menace is a more elusive matter. The black-and-white original - perhaps by being black and white - had menace galore. Splitting Heirs and Mr Nanny fight it out for the Week's Worst Comedy award. Before we open the envelope, let us have a sample scene from each. Here in Splitting Heirs, directed by Robert Young, we see writer-star Eric Idle drop his trousers, fall over, bump into John Cleese, disappear down Barbara Hershey's cleavage and discover he is a British aristocrat not an Anglo-Indian Hindu investment broker. (Short pause for polite laughter). And in our scene from Mr Nanny, directed by Michael Gottlieb, wrestler-star Hulk Hogan dons a tutu, biffs a visiting party of gangsters, saves the children he is bodyguarding, rips off Home Alone and falls into a pond. (Same). And the winner is . . .</p>

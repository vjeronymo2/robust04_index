			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROPOSED DEAL FOR UNITED AIRLINES;  </P> <P> WORKER-OWNED FIRMS ARE OFTEN SUCCESSFUL; KEY IS PARTICIPATION  </P> <P> When Hospital Corp. of America sold 10% of its hospitals to an employee group  in 1987, many analysts thought that the workers were being handed lemons. But  if the hospitals were a lemon, the workers made lemonade.  </P> <P> The new company, Healthtrust Inc., gave local hospital managers more autonomy  to transfer equipment among the hospitals and to implement other efficiencies,  resulting in a $50-million cost savings in the first year, according to Corey  Rosen, executive director of the Oakland-based National Center for Employee  Ownership. Today, Nashville-based Healthtrust is regarded as sound enough to  attract a more favorable rating for its bonds than those of HCA, Rosen said.  </P> <P> Not all employee-owned companies are successful. Those that start with an  inherently sound business and not only transfer ownership to the workers but  give them a bigger role in running the company have fared best, according to  experts who monitor worker-owned firms. They also have quickly begun returning  profits to their employee proprietors in the form of cash or stock.  </P> <P> And while the employee buyout of UAL Corp. announced Friday dwarfs past worker  purchases if it is completed -- it is three times bigger than the next largest  buyout -- analysts say the experience of the fewer than 1,000 companies owned  mostly by their workers clearly maps the path to successful employee ownership.  </P> <P> The best employee-owned companies are those that "have combined employee  ownership with a lot of employee participation," Rosen said. "It's not really a  question of board-level representation, but participation in day-to-day  management."  </P> <P> Critics of the fast-growing phenomenon of employee ownership say many of the  plans are designed to insulate management and take advantage of tax benefits  rather than give genuine control to workers.  </P> <P> But the mere fact of owning a share of one's company in itself is a boon to  employees, insists Louis O. Kelso, the San Francisco investment banker who  developed the modern employee stock ownership plan. "The idea is to enable  people to equip themselves with capital," Kelso said Friday. "Capital works for  its owners. But most people don't own any."  </P> <P> Employee ownership does not "automatically lead to increased productivity and  profitability," said Joseph R. Blasi, an employee ownership analyst at Rutgers  University's Institute of Management and Labor Relations. Employees have  increased expectations about their involvement in the company, he said. Those  expectations may be frustrated if the company does not adopt a team approach to  problem-solving, he said.  </P> <P> Overall, more than 10 million American workers own some part of more than  10,000 companies. As a whole, research shows that these companies have been as  financially successful as firms in comparable businesses that are not employee  owned, Blasi said.  </P> <P> The following is a brief review of the experience of some well known  employee-owned firms:  </P> <P> * Hyatt Clark Industries is no more -- killed by labor strife and foreign  competition. The 100% worker-owned company was formed in 1981 when Clark, N.J.,  workers bought their unprofitable automotive bearings plant from General  Motors. For a time, the company appeared to be thriving, attracting new  customers and new product lines to make a modest profit in 1983. But workers  were never fully involved in management.  </P> <P> In 1984, the workers, who had initially taken a pay cut, wanted a raise.  Management thought the money should be reinvested in the plant. A work slowdown  occurred at a time when foreign competitors slashed prices. Eventually its last  customer, General Motors, declined to renew its contract. The company filed for  bankruptcy and was closed in 1985.  </P> <P> * Weirton Steel -- dramatically rescued by workers in 1984 when the domestic  steel industry collapsed -- has been profitable every quarter since the workers  took over. That record of stability is unmatched by any of its competitors,  according to John C. Tumazos, an analyst with the investment firm of Donaldson,  Lufkin &amp; Jenrette in New York.  </P> <P> "The ability to remain profitable in the difficult years since 1986, the  ability to win new customer accounts, to improve product quality and improve  costs are all important attributes that employee ownership has contributed to,"  Tumazos said of the 7,900-worker West Virginia firm.  </P> <P> Weirton's peak year as an employee-controlled firm was 1988, when profit  reached $150 million, and half of that total, $75 million, was distributed in  stock to employees. The firm's performance, even in down markets, has been so  strong that Weirton was able to go public last year, selling about 23% of its  shares to help finance a five-year, $740-million capital improvement plan.  </P> <P> Tumazos credits the success in part to good management and in part to Weirton's  specialization in tin-plate, the material used in food cans, and hence a  relatively stable business. But, he adds, without employee ownership, Weirton  "would not be in business today."  </P> <P> * Avis Inc., the rental car company, has made employee ownership a marketing  tool, inviting customers to step up to airport counters and do business with an  owner of the company.  </P> <P> The traveling public has responded. Avis remains No. 2 but -- with roughly 27%  of the rental-car market -- the Garden City, N.Y., company is bearing down on  industry leader Hertz.  </P> <P> And workers have gotten to exercise their new role as proprietors, meeting with  top managers on the first Thursday of every month to discuss ways to improve  Avis' performance.  </P> <P> The company's officials say the benefits of employee ownership are clearest in  the area of service.  </P> <P> Employee owners, who know their return on the buyout depends upon customer  satisfaction, have improved lost-and-found procedures, helped design innovative  check-in systems and figured out how to make it easier to find cars in airport  parking lots.  </P> <P> The payoff: Service complaints dropped 35% in the year after Avis' 1987  employee buyout and have fallen every year since.  </P> <P> </P> <P> OWNING THE COMPANY  </P> <P> The largest companies majority owned by employees, ranked by number of  employees.  </P> <TABLE

			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (12): The problem is in the east  -Global warming experts think again Fears about global warming have provided much of the impetus behind the energy efficiency programmes of Western countries. But governments have been slower to introduce many long-promised measures than environmentalists hoped. Meanwhile, some politicians, economists and industrialists are now questioning the scientific basis for these fears. For some years scientists have been predicting that if concentrations of 'greenhouse gases' in the atmosphere continued to increase, the earth could warm up. Governments took those predictions seriously enough to agree, at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, that the risk deserved their attention. Industrialised countries pledged to draw up plans for bringing emissions of greenhouse gases back to 1990 levels in the year 2000, while developing countries committed themselves to promoting energy efficiency. The main greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide, produced when organic material, including fossil fuels, is burnt. Policies to combat global warming have therefore concentrated on limiting carbon dioxide. Emissions of other gases which are incriminated, such as methane, are harder to measure and to control, and have so far inspired less political effort. Governments' main policy tool in trying to draw up plans for curbing carbon emissions has been higher taxes on energy in order to encourage more energy efficiency. However such proposals have run into fierce political opposition in many countries. In the European Union, the proposed tax on energy and its carbon content has stalled, even though this is the only tool the EU has at its disposal for meeting the Rio targets. US President Bill Clinton's proposals for energy taxes, drawn up after Rio, met a similar fate. In the UK, the government's decision to introduce value-added tax on heating fuel provoked a ferocious political row, although steep annual increases on motor fuel and car licences have proved less controversial. Moreover, in the past few years, some of the political momentum has been taken out of the issue by recession, which has proved unexpectedly effective at restraining emissions. It has, just as importantly, reduced the amount of money available in many countries for spending on measures to encourage energy efficiency directly, such as household insulation. At the same time, a chorus of scepticism about the level of the threat posed by global warming has become louder. It has questioned the legislative and economic effort devoted to the problem, and arguably has made it harder to force through politically controversial measures. The essence of the science which underpins the predictions is not contested. Physicists agree that greenhouse gases can trap heat which is emitted from the earth's surface and so prevent it passing into space. But there is still scientific disagreement about the prediction that if the concentrations of these gases build up, the earth will warm up. There is even more disagreement about the amount of warming that might reasonably be expected. The best current predictions of the four leading models of climate change used worldwide suggest that, if carbon dioxide levels double, the world will warm up by between 1.9C and 5.2C from existing levels. Mr Bruce Callander, head of the working party which weighs up scientific research for the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, acknowledges that there are still problems with the models. Taking account of the behaviour of clouds and oceans remains the biggest difficulty, he says. While the IPCC is emphatic that the risk of warming should be taken seriously, it points out too that scientists will need years more data before they know whether the predictions are accurate. Global warming is one of the most difficult examples of a conundrum which politicians increasingly face: how to make policy, which may have considerable economic repercussions, when science is uncertain. Cost-benefit analysis, of the kind now modish in environmental economics, offers little assistance in the case of global warming, given that the probabilities of the threat are so hard to calculate. Moreover, there is intense debate, both scientific and economic, about whether a small degree of warming in the earth's atmosphere would be harmful or beneficial. Some countries, such as Russia, have suggested that they could benefit, as they would be able to farm previously ice-bound regions. Such points have highlighted one of the most controversial aspects of the international debate on climate change: the unequal distribution between countries of the costs of warming, and the costs of mitigation. Increasingly, as they try to put together plans to meet the Rio stipulations, industrialised countries are wondering whether they would do better to spend money helping improve energy efficiency in developing countries. The collapse of the former Soviet Union and Eastern European economies has temporarily restrained the rise of global emissions. But although the introduction of new technology into Eastern and Central Europe is greatly improving their energy efficiency, the emissions from those countries will soon begin to rise again as their economies pick up. Meanwhile, the industrialisation and the population growth of China and India, and China's heavy dependence on coal, means that their carbon emissions are rising steeply. As developed countries which have ratified the Rio convention struggle to persuade their citizens to turn off lights as they leave the room, put only one cup of water in the kettle and walk rather than drive to the shops, they are beginning to ask more urgently than before whether the most efficient way of tackling global warming is not to start with the energy consumption of the developing world.</p>

			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / International Company News: IBJ Securities to lead domestic Nissan issue Nissan Motor, the Japanese carmaker, has appointed IBJ Securities, the securities affiliate of Industrial Bank of Japan, to lead manage the placement of domestic straight bonds worth Y20bn (Dollars 192m). The issue, one of three tranches totalling Y60bn, will be the first led by a securities house affiliated to a bank, established last year, when Japan's ministry of finance partially eased barriers between the banking and securities industries. While Nissan said it had chosen IBJ from its past underwriting record and information gathering ability, it has designated Nikko Securities and Yamaichi Securities to lead manage the other two tranches to 'hedge risks'. Japanese companies have traditionally divided their financing into small lots to maintain favourable relationships with several securities houses. Although foreign houses point out such practices hamper cost efficient fund raising, companies have not been able to break away from the relationship based financing. Nissan hopes to launch the issues in late February or early March. IBJ's tranche will have a maturity of five to six years, Nikko's Y20bn is expected to have a six or seven-year maturity, while Yamaichi's issue a four-year maturity. Since it was set up in July last year, IBJ has lead managed two samurai issues and managed 17 domestic straight bond issues, while participating in six underwriting syndicates.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Parkin, PRESS ASSOCIATION News] </F>   [Text] Sinn Fein has sought further clarification of the  Downing Street peace declaration.    In a move fuelling hopes of a breakthrough in the search for  a political settlement in Ulster, the IRA's political wing has  submitted a detailed list of questions to officials in Dublin,  who will relay them to London.    Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds was on a short trip to  the US today after again making clear his determination that the  clarification logjam could not be allowed to continue.    In a Dublin speech last night, Northern Ireland Secretary  Sir  Patrick Mayhew made no reference to clarification, which Britain  has consistently refused to deliver to Sinn Fein.    But earlier Deputy Irish Premier Dick Spring said no stone  should be left unturned in the effort to explain the declaration  signed by John Major and Mr Reynolds last December.    Mr. Reynolds is expected to refer to the peace process in a  speech at Notre Dame University, Indiana, where he is to receive  an honorary dedgree on Sunday [15 May]. He returns to Dublin the  following day.</p>

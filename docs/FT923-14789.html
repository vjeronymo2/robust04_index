			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Shareholder group calls for changes to stock option plans BRITAIN'S largest shareholder group is to call for changes to executive stock option schemes which could cut their value in many cases by linking benefits more closely to performance. The proposals are part of a consultative document being prepared by the National Association of Pension Funds, whose members have Pounds 300bn under management. It plans to seek industry views on the document when published. The NAPF is studying alternatives to the formula used by many companies which links the granting of stock options to increases in earnings per share. Alternatives under consideration would link options either to a lagged share price over the previous year or to a ratio of share price to an index such as the FTSE-100. Earnings per share as a measure of corporate performance is increasingly under attack from the accountancy profession and institutional shareholders, who argue that the ratio is too easily subject to manipulation by senior managment. An NAPF official said it was seeking a new system which would be less open to manipulation. He said that while such a system would produce more losers than winners, it could benefit successful managers in troubled industries if their share price out-performed those of other companies in the same sector. The NAPF is in talks with the Association of British Insurers (ABI), the UK's other large shareholder group, in an attempt to reach a common position before publishing its proposals. Mr Angus Matheson, chairman of the NAPF's investment committee, said: 'It will be very confusing for companies if one group of shareholders urges one thing while another group says something else.' The ABI has been urging companies to use an EPS formula since 1984 and sees little reason to change. An ABI official said the group saw no better alternative. Linking pay to stock prices holds executives hostage to events such as war or swings in oil prices - events which have nothing to do with how well a management has performed. Sir Richard Lloyd, a member of the Confederation of British Industry's Council and the non-executive chairman at Vickers, said non-executives on remuneration committees had increasingly questioned the link between options and bonuses and EPS. 'Because executives are quite keen to earn their bonuses whenever they can, they have been tempted to put restructuring costs into the 'extraordinary items' line.' The effect of this was to bolster EPS despite a poor underlying performance. Sir David Tweedie, chairman of the Accounting Standards Board, who has criticised City analysts' preoccupation with EPS, said it was a poor gauge of underlying corporate performance.

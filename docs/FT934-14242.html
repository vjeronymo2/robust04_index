			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Assured of a future Wednesday's vote on the introduction of corporate capital is as close as Lloyd's will get to a make-or-break decision. Rejection threatens the resignation of Lloyd's management. Even a delay would scupper the introduction of corporate membership for 1994. While that would give disaffected Names time to press for settlement of legal claims, there is little doubt that potential providers of corporate capital will look elsewhere to take advantage of the turn in the cycle. The immediate need for corporate capital looks less acute than earlier in the year. Individual Names have not deserted in the numbers anticipated. Capital from that source next year is likely to be only a little lower than this. The spate of Bermuda reinsurance companies will also underwrite London market risks. It is possible that the introduction of Pounds 1bn in corporate capital will contribute to a softening of rates in popular areas such as motor. But it is difficult to argue that blocking corporate capital is the best way to tackle the problem. The 1991 underwriting year will bring further large losses for existing Names. New Names may not come forward in future even if the present generation keeps faith. In the long run Lloyd's needs new sources of capital to maintain critical mass. The market's management should certainly reaffirm its commitment to rationing the inflow of capital. The onus is also on managing agents not to accept more capital than can be profitably allocated to syndicates. Preventing periods of feast and famine requires commercial discipline and increased professionalism. A vote in favour of the introduction of corporate members would be a large step in that direction.</p>

The other 37 resolutions, which the government accepted in  between the parliament sessions, were sent for consideration to  the Saeima (parliament) standing committees.    The rejected rule stipulated the setup of  counterintelligence  services to prognosticate, monitor and neutralize any danger to  the national security. The services were also designed to  gather information on concrete candidates for important  government posts.    A heated debate arose when considering the Cabinet  resolutions on the Riga local government and the amendments to  the law on the status of a local deputy.    As reported, the government adopted these norms Jan. 10  after  the conflict between local authorities and Russian officers.  The rules allow for dismissing any local government head who  repeatedly fails to observe laws or Cabinet resolutions.    The norms are inconsistent with the principles of a  rule-of-law state, according to which an elected person is  dismissed only by a court ruling, said Maris Budovskis, of the  National Independence Movement faction.    If the Saeima had rejected the resolution, Andrejs Rucs, the  fired Vidzeme district head, should have been restored in office.</p>

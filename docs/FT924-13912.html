			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Mastering Gatwick's history lesson: The dilemma facing operators at one of the world's busiest airports History may have caught up with Davies &amp; Newman, owner of Dan-Air - the oldest British airline still operating under its original name. If Dan-Air collapses, its demise will echo that of other Gatwick-based scheduled carriers. Air Europe sunk with its parent, International Leisure Group, in March last year. British United was taken over by British Caledonian in 1971. Nearly four years ago, BCal was in turn bought by British Airways which is still trying to turn around the Gatwick operations. Some will blame the recession and recall that Dan-Air entered it in a weakened state. Others will ask whether Mr David James, the company doctor, was too daring in expanding the scheduled side of the business, rather than cutting costs and losses. But the question will also be reiterated: is it commercially viable for an independent airline to run a scheduled European network based on Gatwick? The crux of the problem is whether enough higher-fare business travellers can be attracted to Gatwick to prop up the yield (average revenue per seat). Gatwick is one of the busiest international airports in the world, with nearly 20m passengers a year, but only one in five are business travellers. That compares with nearly half of the 44m passengers at Heathrow. Gatwick suffered last year when the London air traffic distribution rules, preventing new carriers operating from Heathrow, were abolished. That prompted several airlines, including Virgin Atlantic, to move flights to Heathrow. According to BAA figures, Gatwick traffic has fallen by 11 per cent, from a peak of 21.2m in the year to March 1990 to 18.9m in 1991-92. Business travel shows a decline to 20.7 per cent, from 22.5 per cent in 1990-91. The BAA also uncovered uncomfortable statistics last year among business people based in the Gatwick heartland south of London. 'Four out of five Brighton businessmen were driving past and going to Heathrow; and only one in six from Redhill was using Gatwick.' Gatwick's prominent role in carrying leisure traffic is reflected in the high proportion of charter flights and of leisure travellers on scheduled services. The 44 per cent of non-scheduled flights from Gatwick compares with 0.2 per cent at Heathrow. Heathrow's greater volume of business traffic creates a virtuous circle, whereby it can offer frequency of flights and connections with other airlines' flights. To offer comprehensive timetables, airlines have to run off-peak services at lower yields to complement their busy morning and evening trips. Again, Heathrow has an advantage. As Mr Randolph Fields, a former shareholder in Davies &amp; Newman, puts it, Heathrow's ability to 'skim off the high-yield cream' also enables airlines operating from there to 'penetrate the low-yield market at will on a marginal cost basis'. The competition for off-peak traffic is effectively cross-subsidised. The advantages are reflected in the contrasting fortunes of Dan-Air and British Midland, the UK's second biggest scheduled airline, which controls 14 per cent of the slots at Heathrow. British Midland is profitable and has attracted a substantial partner. Scandinavian Airlines System paid Pounds 50m for a 40 per cent stake in its parent company. British Airways' losses at Gatwick bode ill. BA is tackling this by making a virtue of Gatwick's 'one-terminal hub and spoke facility', dovetailing short-haul and long-haul services. Traffic has increased after a rescheduling exercise and costs have been cut; about 300 jobs were shed earlier this year. Two conclusions Virgin reached studying Davies &amp; Newman's books were that Dan-Air should be pruned and simplified. The gravity of Davies &amp; Newman's financial position has incurred the problem of ebbing customer confidence. The UK's top three package holiday companies, Thomson, Owners Abroad and Airtours, all have their own airlines. It is, perhaps, no coincidence that Airtours, once a big Dan-Air customer, announced that it was setting up an airline in late 1990, about the time of the first Davies &amp; Newman financial crisis. Uncertainty exacerbates the situation since the suspension of Davies &amp; Newman's shares on September 28. The pressure is on Mr James to organise swiftly the third rescue in two years.</p>

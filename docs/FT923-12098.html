			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Saudi-Yemeni talks on dispute Yemeni and Saudi Arabian officials met yesterday to set up formal talks on a dispute over an oil-rich border region which has jeopardised exploration in the area, Reuter reports from Geneva. They said the heads of the two delegations, who arrived at the weekend, had brief discussions in Geneva and agreed to meet again today. There was no comment, or even confirmation, that the talks had taken place from either the Saudi or Yemeni missions to the United Nations' European headquarters in Geneva.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Liana Minasyan: "Elections Which Were Threatened </F> Were Held After All; 28,000 Georgians Elected 5 Deputies, While  35,500 Ossetians Elected 36"]    [Text] Last Sunday's elections to the state nykhas, the  supreme organ of South Ossetia, were perceived with enthusiasm  by the population. By noontime, half of the voters had already  voted, and the primary result was achieved. By the time the  polls closed, 80 percent of the voters had visited them.    According to the official information supplied by  Tsentrizbirkom [Central Electoral Committee] Chairman Boris  Chochiyev, 41 electoral districts had been created. However,  elections were held in only 36 of them, with the rest falling in  Georgian villages. The question posed by one of the members of  the CSCE [Council for Security and Cooperation in Europe]  mission who was in Tskhinvali at the time of the elections--why  were 28,000 members of the Georgian population given only 5  seats in parliament, while 35,500 Ossetian voters got to elect  36 deputies--remained unanswered. Thus, unlike the parliament of  Abkhaziya, which had been exploded by the quota principle of  representation, the elections to the South Ossetian nykhas  demonstrated once again that Tskhinvali ignores Tbilisi, and the  local Georgian population ignores the local Tskhinvali  authorities.    Nevertheless, many, including the commander of the Russian  peacekeeping forces in South Ossetia, Nikolay Pavlov, even the  day before the elections had serious doubts that the elections  would take place without any excesses. Three days earlier, a  hostage was taken in the Georgian village of Nuli, and a group  demanded a ransom of 50 million rubles (R) for him. Certain  circumstances surrounding this incident force us to believe that  this was not an ordinary criminal action. After a thorough  investigation, official Tskhinvali authorities never were able  to determine who took the hostage. The R50 million were  prepared. However, the members of the CSCE mission, together  with the Russian peacekeepers, never did meet the middleman for  transfer of the money.    Meanwhile, the Georgians responded to this by seizing eight  people (the six women and two children were freed after  negotiations). The Georgian population blocked the roads in all  directions leading to Tskhinvali. The peacekeepers were  seriously concerned that if the situation could not be diffused,  there would be a chain reaction of mutual violence.    The incident really did give reason for mutual suspicions.  The Tskhinvali authorities accused the Georgian authorities of  wanting to undermine the elections. The commander of the  Georgian battalion of peacekeeping forces, Nodar Tatarishvili,  expressed the supposition that this was the work of Ossetian  radicals who had decided to heat up anti-Georgian sentiments  before the election.    However, be that as it may, no hostages have been taken here  for over a year now. Moreover, the sum of the ransom, contrary  to accepted practice, was extremely high (usually they demand  from R1 to R3 million, depending on the "status" of the  hostage). And although General Pavlov was full of decisiveness  to oppose the bandits, the situation has not yet been fully  resolved.    Nevertheless, the elections were held, even though they had  an entertaining topic: There were 151 candidates running for 36  seats. A large part of the candidates were party nominees--12  parties, associations and unions entered into the struggle, and  the most active among them was the Communist Party. The  opposition became concerned when it discovered that many  independent deputies, who in the former Supreme Soviet did not  comprise the majority, turned out to be unable to withstand the  promises to "bring back" the Soviet Union. Also playing a role  was the fact that the leaders of the former Supreme Soviet,  Torez Kulumbekov and Alan Chochiyev, had long ago left South  Ossetia. This overshadowed the farewell with the former Supreme  Soviet and had an effect on the reputation of the remaining  deputies. And although the current chairman of the Supreme  Soviet, Lyudvig Chibirov, believes that "the line of the former  parliament will not be subject to revision, despite the fact  that, according to the estimates, the make-up of the deputies  will change by 60 percent," many believe that not only will the  state nykhas be more "moderate," including in regard to Georgia,  but that it will be simply an unprofessional and pliable organ.  The absence of any active policy and self-sufficient organ of  administration has already brought South Ossetia to the brink of  catastrophe. Chairman Chibirov himself has not yet been elected  to the new parliament but, like most of the deputies running in  the city districts, has remained for the second round. His  rival, the minister of foreign relations of South Ossetia,  represents the Republic Party for People's Unity of Ossetia--a  party representing the higher segment of power structures.    The members of the CSCE mission, who are trying to renew  contacts between Tskhinvali and Tbilisi, believe that Chibirov  is a perceptive man. However, sensing the acuteness of the  moment, he himself is in no hurry publicly to break down the  "wall of China" which, in his words, has arisen between Georgia  and Ossetia over the last five years. Chibirov announced that  "if the parliament of Georgia has repealed the Supreme Soviet of  Abkhazia, we too will not escape this same verdict. But this is  of no consequence for us. South Ossetia has its own  constitution, on the basis of which we held the elections,  placing a legal foundation under our republic."</p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Chesterfield Properties doubles to Pounds 7.81m A sharp reduction in interest charges, reflecting property sales and falling interest rates, was behind more than doubled interim profits at Chesterfield Properties, the investment and development group. Turnover in the six months to June 30 amounted to Pounds 17.3m, against Pounds 20.5m restated for FRS 3, including Pounds 13.9m (Pounds 17.9m) from rental income. After a profit of Pounds 3.38m on the disposal of its 60 per cent stake in a warehouse investment and interest payable of Pounds 5.13m (Pounds 9.85m), pre-tax profits emerged at Pounds 7.81m (Pounds 3.4m). Interest of Pounds 1.18m (Pounds 1.87m) arising on development properties was capitalised. Chesterfield's small entertainment division incurred a deficit of Pounds 184,000 (profit of Pounds 22,000). Directors said the difficult trading conditions for theatres and cinemas in London's West End deteriorated further in the first half. 'No improvement is yet evident', they added. After tax and minorities, earnings per share jumped from 5.48p to 20.3p; the interim dividend goes up 0.5p to 4p.</p>

A survey shows that business people from 54 countries and  regions have set up 7,547 projects in this, China's largest  economic center, and 64 percent of them have gone into operation.    These projects have a combined investment of 14.9 billion  U.S. dollars on contract, and actual investment amounts to 5.1  billion U.S. dollars.    In particular, service trade projects are playing an  important role in Shanghai's municipal economy.    Last year saw them deliver 3.8 billion yuan to the municipal  government in taxes, an increase of 73 percent, or 2.2 billion  yuan, over the previous year. The proportion of taxes accounted  for 16 percent of the city's total collected in that year.    A local official in charge of foreign investment said that  exports by foreign-funded enterprises here earned 7.34 billion  U.S. dollars last year, occupying 21.8 percent of the city's  total.    Economists here agree that Shanghai already has effectively  combined the use of foreign investment with its development of  services first, industry second and agriculture third.    Of the city's contractual foreign investment, projects  involved in agriculture account for 0.17 percent, in industry  for 41.46 percent and in the service trades for 58.37 percent.    Shanghai's improved investment environment has drawn the  attention of noted trans-national corporations.    Altogether, 44 trans-national corporations set up 68  projects  involving a total investment of 950 million U.S. dollars in  Shanghai last year.    So far, 128 trans-national corporations have launched 206  projects in shanghai, involving a total foreign investment of  2.5 billion U.S. dollars.    Of the trans-national corporations, at least 90 percent come  from the United States, Japan and European countries, and 35 out  of the 200 largest industrial trans-national corporations in the  world have invested in Shanghai.    The official noted that the municipal government approved  the  establishment of 205 projects, each with an investment of more  than 10 million U.S. dollars, last year, an increase of 200  percent over the previous year. These projects involve a total  investment of 4.2 billion U.S. dollars, up 220 percent.    By the end of February this year the municipal government  had  approved 466 projects, each with an investment of at least 10  million U.S. dollars. These projects, with a total foreign  investment of 9.7 billion U.S. dollars, accounted for 65 percent  of the city's total.    "The large foreign-funded projects have brought funds and  advanced international technology, and become backbone  enterprises of the city," the official said.    He disclosed that the foreign-funded industrial projects are  mainly in the fields of integrated circuits, optical fiber  communications and equipment, compressor for air-conditioners,  digital program-controlled telephone exchanges and mobile  telephone terminal equipment.    They have played an important role in helping adjust  Shanghai's industrial structure, according to the official.    One example is the Shanghai Volkswagen Corporation, a  Sino-German joint venture, which produced 100,000  Shanghai-Santana cars last year. More than 80 percent of the  car parts were made in China.    With an annual sales output value exceeding 10 billion yuan,  the corporation has become a key enterprise in Shanghai.    Another example is the Shanghai Bell Telephone Equipment  Manufacturing Co. Ltd, also a Sino-foreign joint venture, of  which the telecommunications products occupy at least one half  of the Chinese market.    The official said that service trades have become favorites  for foreign investment, which has penetrated the fields of  banking, real estate trade, commerce, culture and recreation,  information consultancy, catering, design, education and public  health.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian State Duma has adopted at its first  reading the draft Federal Constitutional bill on the Russian  Constitutional Court. The issue of judges' terms of office  provoked a lot of controversy during the debate. The term of 12  years has been defined. The right granted to the president to  suggest candidates for judges' positions in the Constitutional  court was another important norm which also provoked a  controversial reaction among the deputies. However, consensus  was also achieved on this matter.</p>

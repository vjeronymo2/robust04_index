			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / AT&amp;T agrees three-year pay deal: Agreement focusing on job security will go to employees for ratification AT&amp;T, the world's largest communications company, yesterday announced tentative agreement with its two unions which gives employees pay rises of up to 11.8 per cent over three years, stock shares and a generous compensation scheme for laid off workers. The agreement, coming after a month of negotiations with federal mediators, is subject to ratification by about 125,000 AT&amp;T employees. The unions - the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers - this year chose not to strike when the deadline for settlement passed on May 31 but to use other means to pressure the company. Their strategy was to urge other unions and small businesses to switch to other long-distance telephone companies. With AT&amp;T due to cut 6,000 more jobs - in addition to 133,000 lost since the sell-off its regional operations - job security was a main concern. The company agreed that employees declared 'surplus' can choose to take special unpaid leave of up to two years to pursue career or personal interests while the company pays all benefits, including tuition assistance. Those with at least five years of service can be referred to temporary jobs in the company with no loss of pay for two years. AT&amp;T also agreed to establish a stock ownership programme, which would award stock worth Dollars 3,300 (Pounds 1,780) in two instalments over the next three years. With the union demanding pay increases of 13 per cent over three years and the company offering 8 per cent, a compromise 11.8 per cent was agreed with mediators. Pensions are to be increased by 13 per cent. Former employees will get first call on new jobs for three years. Family health benefits were expanded, and AT&amp;T said it would give employees a greater voice in decision-making.</p>

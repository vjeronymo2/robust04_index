			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rahamim Ya'aqov and Uri Arazi] </F>   [Text] "We have been backed into a corner. We were  ostracized when Rabbi Kahana was banned from being a Knesset  member and when our list was prohibited from running in the  Knesset elections. We are under serious pressure. I have the  feeling that Dr. Barukh Goldstein's deed could happen again."    These remarks were made yesterday by a member of the Kahana  Hay movement. "I would not be surprised," the man said, "if  such an action were to take place within the walls of the  Knesset, whose members blackball and persecute us. Look what  one Jew did, and how effective it is."    At around 2100 last night, an anonymous caller phoned  MA'ARIV  and said that "500 Arabs would be slaughtered if Binyamin Kahana  was not released from his prison cell in Hadera by midnight."    A check by MA'ARIV revealed that a similar anonymous phone  call was received by the duty officer at the Hadera police  station. The Hadera police have launched an investigation.</p>

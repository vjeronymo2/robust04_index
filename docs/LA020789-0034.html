			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AUTO INSURANCE CONTROVERSY  </P> <P> Your article on inflated auto insurance claims was great. It showed that the  real cause of high auto insurance rates is greedy accident "victims" and their  equally greedy lawyers and doctors. But why did you wait until now to come out  with this story? Why didn't you come out with it when it could have made a real  impact -- before the elections?  </P> <P> Who knows, if you had, we might now have the no-fault type insurance we need to  eliminate the higher costs brought on by such inflated claims.  </P> <P> ALFRED A.

			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Peseta hit by Basque claims Accusations of government involvement in a secret 'dirty' war against separatist Basque terrorist sympathisers shook Spanish markets again yesterday, sending the peseta to an historic low against the D-Mark. Increased fears of political instability drew Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, into giving a rare press conference yesterday, but he failed to settle market nerves. The Madrid Bolsa fell to its lowest level since the European currency crisis in the autumn of 1992. Mr Gonzalez, who is facing the most testing period of his 12 years in power, rejected allegations that his government had been involved in a shadowy death squad and said he had no intention of resigning or of calling early elections. 'There is a majority that prefers the stability that comes from serving out the full legislature,' said the premier who won a fourth successive four-year term in 1992, although he fell short of an overall majority. But as a relaxed looking Mr Gonzalez dug in his political heels, the Bolsa came under sharp selling pressure and its general index closed at 280.33 points, 3.26 points down on Wednesday. The index has lost nearly 6 per cent of its value since the government was rocked last week by allegations that linked it to an undercover war against Basque separatists in the mid-1980s. The peseta, which had stood at Pta84.64 against the D-Mark on Wednesday, dropped to Pta85.20 before steadying to close at Pta84.94. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year bond was pushed up to 11.88 per cent from Wednesday's 11.72 per cent. The government, which has been shaken by a string of scandals and corruption allegations this year, is highly embarrassed by a well publicised legal probe into a group of mercenaries who fought members of the Basque Eta organisation in southwest France 10 years ago. Three former security chiefs were remanded in custody last week in connection with the dirty war, and more indictments are likely. Questioned over the death squad allegations, Mr Gonzalez said his government had 'acted strictly within the framework of the law in what was an extraordinarily difficult situation'. He rejected opposition calls for his resignation as 'out of the question' and said his government had 'sufficiently solid support' to continue in office. Assurances of continued backing came from the Catalan nationalist leader, Mr Jordi Pujol, whose party has provided Mr Gonzalez with a parliamentary majority over the past 18 months. In an interview with a Barcelona newspaper yesterday, Mr Pujol said the prime minister could count on his 'wholehearted and firm support'. Stability is unlikely to return to domestic politics, however, until the judicial investigation into alleged illicit activities by the security services is concluded. A separate legal probe, that is proving equally damaging, concerns alleged widescale embezzlement of public funds by senior officials at the interior ministry. The politically-driven market nervousness that is battering the Spanish markets meanwhile contrasts with clear signs of domestic economic recovery. Mr Gonzalez said the recovery was 'taking on spectacular characteristics', that there would be net job creation this month and that Spain's growth would be above the EU average in 1995.</p>

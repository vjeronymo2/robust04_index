			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The ANC [African National Congress] has lashed out  at Inkatha. The ANC has accused the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]  of abusing the position of the Zulu king and the name of the  Zulu people to further the political objectives of the IFP and  its leader, Mangosuthu Buthelezi.    A statement from ANC Midlands spokesman Blade Nzimande says  yesterday's march on the Union Buildings in Pretoria was part of  the continued abuse of Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini. Nzimande  said the fact of the matter is that people who marched to  Pretoria yesterday were IFP members and not the entire Zulu  nation. He's also expressed the ANC's condemnation of violence  and thuggery that occurred. He says the ANC regards yesterday's  behavior of the IFP as a dress rehearsal of national  destabilization in the future.</p>

			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Letter: Life up north Sir, With reference to Observer's comments about the government decision to move the Department of Employment's key policy unit for small firms to Sheffield ('Faraway Faceless', May 3), his obvious bias against the north does him no credit. The decision to move any government department out of the over-crowded and over-rated south is to be welcomed. Here in the north-west, our only regret is that the decision did not involve Stockport or Preston or Chester or Blackburn. Despite emotive words such as 'exile' the lifestyle north of Watford can only be described as excellent. On his implied concern about the potential communication difficulties between government departments and ministers, distance has never struck me as a problem. The 'Sir Humphrey' syndrome seems more apposite and that happens whatever the distance. Bruce Scott, managing director, Buckleys, Bredbury, Stockport, Cheshire</p>

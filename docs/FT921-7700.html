			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Bonn urged to speed Uruguay Round talks THE presidents of Germany's six top economic institutes are urging the government to back the effort for agreement in the Gatt Uruguay Round, even if it means more drastic farm reform, Quentin Peel reports from Bonn. Expressing their 'deep concern' that the talks faced collapse over farm subsidies, the six spelt out a string of reasons why failure would damage the German economy. These include the fragile state of the world economy, the exposure of Germany more than any other industrialised country to world trade, and the urgent need for eastern Europe, especially east Germany, to gain access to world markets. The appeal amounts to an attempt to swing the debate in the government in favour of farm reform. 'The government must disregard the particular interests of agriculture, press for reform of European agricultural policy, and overcome the resistance of individual EC member states, if it is to face up to the economic responsibility expected of it throughout the world.' The institutes include those from Munich, Berlin, Essen, Kiel, Hamburg and Halle.</p>

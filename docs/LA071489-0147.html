They're so rude. My favorite  is the classic miniskirt, in denim."  </P> <P> Adrienne Moore, 15, sophomore, Corona del Mar  </P> <P> "I like Stussy clothes. I don't like punk-rock-style and black-on-black  clothes."  </P> <P> Jason Randono, 17, senior, Corona del Mar  </P> <P> "Batman clothes are my least favorite. Birkenstocks (suede sandals) are my  favorite."  </P> <P> Cammie Zenz, 15, sophomore, Corona del Mar  </P> <P> "I like vests and tank tops.

I don't like . . . I hate hot pink. And  skirts, I hate skirts."  </P> <P> Jennifer Poetoehena, 14, freshman, Costa Mesa  </P> <P> "I love the color black, so I like anything that has black.

I like all the styles, I guess."  </P> <P> Matt Polentz, 15, sophomore, Edison  </P> <P> "I like the classic look -- conservative and kind of dressy. I don't like the  shabby look, with ripped jeans and stuff like that."  </P> <P> Jillian Duncan, 17, senior, El Modena  </P> <P> "Fluorescent colors are my favorites. I hate it when people wear hats with  their clothes."  </P> <P> Lesli Steinert, 15, sophomore, El Toro  </P> <P> "I like fanny packs just because they're easy to carry.

I like jeans a lot."  </P> <P> Kathleen Turnbaugh, 15, sophomore, Fountain Valley  </P> <P> "My least favorite is the whole black style, with black on black and all. My  favorite would be the really trendy stuff, like Debbie Gibson wears, and in  Seventeen magazine."  </P> <P> Elisa Gonzales, 15, freshman, Mater Dei  </P> <P> "I like the sporty beach or surf style, and denim.

Vogue is my favorite."  </P> <P> Elizabeth Medina, 16, sophomore, Mountain View  </P> <P> "I don't like fluorescents; they're the worst. I do like Esprit clothes."  </P> <P> Lisa Calvano, 14, sophomore, Ocean View  </P> <P> "I don't like the valley girl trend, like how they talk and dress.

Those new bell-bottom things,  those Vogue-style pants . . . those are crazy."  </P> <P> Chrissy Johnson, 16, junior, Trabuco Hills  </P> <P> "My favorite would be casual classy clothes.

Really nothing is my least favorite, except old-fashioned clothes or anything  out-of-date."  </P> <P> Mike Ventura, 16, junior, University  </P> <P> "My least favorite is probably fluorescent. My favorite clothes are colorful  cotton T-shirts, like tie-dyed."  </P> <P> Kristina Yoseloff, 16, junior, Valencia  </P> <P> "I don't like the real neon, like neon shoelaces. I like Nike -- shoes and  apparel."  </P> <P> Mike Fender, 17, senior, Woodbridge  </P> <P> "Too trendy is yucky. The European look is cool. Wet Seal is too trendy."  </P> <P> Phoebe Hwang, 16, junior, Woodbridge  </P> <P> "I like surf and beach clothes. I don't like the cut-off jeans look."  </P> <P> David Nguyen, 16, junior, Woodbridge  </P> <P> "My least favorite is that dark brown-khaki-greenish color.

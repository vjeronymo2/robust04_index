			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin told  Interfax Thursday that he considered the State Duma's passing of  the draft federal budget for 1994 at first hearing as a  recognition of the economic policy pursued by the government.    Dubinin said the collection rate of taxes fluctuated around  60 percent at the moment, which is obviously insufficient. The  Finance Ministry put forward a number of proposals to increase  the tax influx to the state budget. In part, the proposals  involve taxation bodies' registering all accounts of  enterprises, including hard currency ones, and collecting taxes  directly from the accounts.    At the same time, Dubinin pointed out that the tax basis  shrank due to an economic decline. He said taxes collected in  the first quarter of 1994 were equal to seven percent of the  gross domestic product against 10 percent last year. In March,  the situation was stabilized at last year's level, he added.    Dubinin supported further improvement of the existing  taxation system which needed adjustment rather than reformation.  "The existing set of taxes may be reduced, but not changed for  another one," he pointed out. Dubinin put a special emphasis  on the fact that the federation items had been granted the right  to impose their own taxes, a right which it would be "very  unreasonable to take away from them."</p>

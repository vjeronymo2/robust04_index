			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / World Trade News: US stalls over BA-USAir code-sharing The British and US governments yesterday continued the tense diplomatic poker game over the future of airline services between the two countries as today's deadline for US renewal of a ticket code-sharing agreement between British Airways and USAir approached. Airline lobbyists on both sides of the Atlantic were anxiously scrambling to find out whether the US Department of Transportation would finally renew the BA-USAir code-sharing arrangement or provoke an airline trade war between the two countries by withdrawing the British carrier's code-sharing rights. Under intense pressure from some of its biggest carriers, including American Airlines and Delta Air Lines, the US authorities have also threatened to renounce the existing aviation agreement between the two countries, a move which would badly damage US-UK relations and undermine both countries' efforts to liberalise international air transport. The UK has already warned Washington it would retaliate swiftly against a decision not to renew BA's code-sharing rights with its US airline partner or to renew them only for a very short period. This is likely to involve restrictions on flights by American Airlines and United Airlines into London's Heathrow airport. In turn, such a move would inevitably lead to an escalation in trade tensions, with the US restricting flights by UK carriers into its market, threatening to provoke even more disruption for transatlantic passengers already shaken by the recent IRA terror campaign at Heathrow airport. At the heart of the conflict are US demands for greater access immediately for its airlines into Heathrow airport, which under a 1991 agreement, can only be served by American and United. The US has also sought to link the BA code-sharing rights with USAir, the sixth largest US carrier, with the broader renegotiation of the bilateral aviation agreement between the two countries. The UK has proposed a gradual three-stage process of liberalising transatlantic air services and has insisted that the US must honour its obligations under the 1991 agreement granting UK carriers code-sharing rights in the US. The US, however, refused to discuss the British three-stage proposal and cancelled negotiations in January. The UK side has since attempted to revive the negotiations, but the US has continued to refuse to hold formal talks to try to resolve the deadlock. Both American Airlines and Delta urged their government last week to renounce the current bilateral agreement and withdraw BA's code-sharing rights, arguing that the UK carrier was now able to tap the huge US domestic aviation market without comparable benefits for US carriers in the UK. The issue has been further complicated by BA's decision last week to suspend additional investment in USAir because of the parlous financial state of its US airline partner in which it has already invested Dollars 400m (Pounds 268m) for a 24 per cent stake. The British government has since said it would have to review its position on a new 'open skies' deal with the US given US approval of BA's future investments in USAir have been a central part of the liberalisation talks. But the UK transport authorities said this week that they wanted talks to continue and that the UK was 'not walking away' from the process. In Washington yesterday, the code-sharing pact was to be discussed by the National Economic Council and possibly the National Security Council in the White House. Congressional sentiment has been divided. With the administration, already under international fire for its Japan and China trade policies, not many expect Washington to provoke a trade war with one of its closest allies. The stakes are big: nothing less than the future aviation relationship of two countries linked by international air routes with the world's highest volume of traffic (11.5m passengers last year).</p>

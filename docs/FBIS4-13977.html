			<p>BFN     [Text] London, Apr. 25, IRNA -- After securing land and air  arms deals with Persian Gulf states that are due to go on until  the next century, the UK is now focusing on maritime defense  equipment sales based again on invented fears of a so-called  Iranian threat.    According to Jane's sentinel editor, Paul Beaver,  international submarine suppliers are rushing to exploit the  fears. For example, he points out Britain's offering to rent to  littoral states the first of four new upholder-class submarines  decommissioned by the defense ministry.    The sale pitch is apparently orchestrated around the false  perception in the West of Iran's naval defense capability  following the delivery to Iran of two Russian kilo-class  conventional submarines last year.    To give the drive more credibility, Western navies are said  to have fitted their warships in the region with torpedo decoy  equipment. The old adage about 50 percent of hydrocarbons used  by industrial nations passing through the Hormuz Strait is also  exploited to the hilt.    The switch in emphasis to naval defense follows Britain's  much-trumpeted arms sales in the Persian Gulf, which climaxed  the biggest-ever "al-Yamamah deal" to Saudi Arabia and which has  made the UK the world's second biggest arms exporter after the  U.S.    The British proposal to rent submarines was said by Beaver  to  include an experienced crew as a way of outbidding the French  and Americans, who are also seeking to reap the benefits of the  built-up feeling of maritime insecurity in the region.    In a special report for this week's Middle East Economic  Digest, Beaver quoted numerous Western defense companies bidding  for contracts to supply Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and  the UAE with a variety of submarines.    Although budgets are tight in the Persian Gulf due to low  oil  prices, Beaver believed that there was little doubt that the  need for security of oil platforms will ensure funding is found.  He suggested that the first significant anti-submarine defence  and surveillance systems could be expected in the Persian Gulf  later this year.</p>

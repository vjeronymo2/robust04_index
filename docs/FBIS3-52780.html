After establishing the armed force  (police and public security), 'Arafat now wants to create  security services for the presidency and national security  (intelligence) to control any security problem from the  opposition Palestinian forces.    Arab sources told AL-SHIRA' that 'Arafat is deliberately  procrastinating at the negotiations, setting conditions that are  not mentioned in the Gaza-Jericho agreement he signed with  Israel. He is buying time to prepare his own security.</p>

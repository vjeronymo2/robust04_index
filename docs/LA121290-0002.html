			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. HELP FOR FOOD SHORTAGES IN SOVIET UNION  </P> <P> In response to "So What If the Soviets Starve?" editorial, Dec. 4:  </P> <P> I agree with the principles expressed in your editorial, on high moral as well  as on practical political grounds. And yet, should Washington and the Bush  Administration really rush to aid the crumbling Evil Empire which so long and  so mercilessly exploited its captive and crushed fellow socialist nations in  Eastern Europe, not to mention its own people? Or should public donations of  food and medicine (Dec. 3) start pouring into the world's mightiest nuclear  power?  </P> <P> Should the selfless good-heartedness of the much-maligned American public be  exploited so that the Soviet Union would not have to face serious military  cutbacks or perhaps even temporary suspension of its no-expense-spared space  program? These are disturbing questions.  </P> <P> If the food shortage is caused by the breakdown of transportation, distribution  and storage by the crumbling government-run system, how could this hierarchy be  trusted to store, transport and distribute thousands of tons of massive U.S.  food and medical aid? Wouldn't it be much more appropriate to redouble our  efforts to save the starving and dying children in Africa who are helpless  victims of drought and famine, rather than rushing to aid a European  superpower?  </P> <P> One may indeed wish the Soviets well in their "perilous but necessary voyage  into the unknown," but perhaps not at the expense of U.S. taxpayers or  charities, or perhaps just not yet.  </P> <P> E.

Krikalyov made two space flights on the Russian "Mir" space  station, the first lasted for 151 days in 1988-1989 and the  second - 312 days from May 1991 to March 1992.    Krikalyov who was trained for the shuttle flight in the  United States said the Russian training programme is better in  many aspects.    Krikalyov, who is a computer engineer, said the computers  installed on the "Discovery" had been designed long ago and are  considerably inferior to the computer centre onboard the "Mir".    He also complained about an inconvenient work schedule in  orbit - in two shifts. There is only one sleeping-bag for two  crew members and they have to sleep in turn, according to him.    Krikalyov was surprised that after the training programme  was  completed astronauts did not have to pass any exams or tests.  It is the captain who bears all responsibility for the flight  preparations.    This is the second delay in the launch of the space shuttle.  Initially it was planned for last November 10, but was also  postponed.</p>

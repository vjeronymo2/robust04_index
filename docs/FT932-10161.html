			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Pact on wide-screen TV still eludes EC AGREEMENT on a European strategy for the development of advanced wide-screen television was still blocked last night by a dispute over funding between Britain and its 11 EC partners. But British officials said telecoms ministers were closer than ever before to a deal on advanced television, based on a compromise tabled by the Danish presidency of the Community. Earlier, Mr Edward Leigh, the British telecoms minister, indicated that the UK was not prepared to back a funding plan which would cost the Community more than Ecu150m (Pounds 118.5m) between now and 1998. The UK's EC partners welcomed this as the first sign that Britain, which has been blocking a deal for 18 months, was prepared to allow any Community funding for such a plan. But most member states believe at least Ecu200m is necessary to kick-start what they hope will be a lucrative market for wide-screen, cinema-quality television in Europe. Failure would not necessarily lead to the disintegration of the Commission's seven-year-old ambition to back European advanced television against US and Japanese competition. Discussion would almost certainly resume on June 16 at a special meeting of telecoms ministers in Luxembourg. Under the Danish plan, the Community would match funds put up by programme-makers and broadcasters wishing to develop programmes in the new wide-screen format. Some of the total EC funding would be held in reserve to back projects submitted later by countries with less well-developed audio-visual industries.</p>

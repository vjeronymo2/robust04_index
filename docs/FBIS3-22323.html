			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Underground Nuclear Submarines?"] </F>   [Text] That is right. Now in Maritime Kray submarines that  have served out their useful life will be dispatched for eternal  storage not to the bottom of the sea, but into the rocky soil of  the Far East. The kray is short of electric power, to the tune  of 400 mwt/hr; where to get the needed capacities? At the same  time, 27 nuclear reactors are idle at decommissioned Pacific  Fleet submarines; they can still produce electricity but are no  longer transportable, plus they cannot be put to sea on  rusted-through old vessels.    On the other hand, to simply mount used reactors at existing  AES [nuclear power stations] means making oneself a subject of  justified criticism of the "greens" and add worries to local  population. It has been decided that if these reactors are to  serve for the good of the national economy, it is only from  underground. It has not been decided yet where the underground  AES will be placed: in old mines or specially built tunnels.</p>

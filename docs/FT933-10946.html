			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / How to Spend It: A bright cotton wrap to wear around your middle YOU may think it is a skirt but anybody who has been to east Africa knows better. A Kikoi is a bright cotton wrap that east African men wear around their middles with panache and dignity writes Lucia van der Post. Practical, tough and eminently washable, it is made from a long piece of cloth, 1 metre wide. It is secured by folding in the ends, drawing them around the waist and rolling the top down. It can be worn for sleeping, slopping round the house, beach-combing. It is a perfect holiday garment - and you do not have to go to Kenya to get one. Simon Friend imports and sells them in a variety of colourways at Pounds 22.50. Coming in soon at Davies, 10 Great Newport St, London WC2 and American Retro, 35 Old Compton St, London W1 and 14 Pembridge Rd, London W11. For other stockists contact Simon Friend, 13 Hemberton Road, London SW9 9 LE. Tel: 071-274-7827.</p>

			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Gaza-Jericho Autonomy: Israel will spin out next stage of peace process - The road ahead The Gaza-Jericho agreement could prove to be a small but important step on the road towards Palestinian aspirations for an independent state. The next phases of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process are, however, mired in ambiguity and open to different interpretation by each side. Essentially, yesterday's agreement gives the PLO a five-year interim period of self-rule (more than autonomy but less than statehood) over the Gaza Strip and the West Bank enclave of Jericho. The accord, covering a limited slice of the Palestinian land occupied by Israel in the 1967 Six Day War, is supposed to be a transitional agreement towards a permanent solution to the Palestinian question in 1998. The agreement rules out, for the moment, Palestinian statehood, the definition of international borders, Palestinian control over the rest of the West Bank and Arab East Jerusalem, and the right of return of up to 4m Palestinian refugees. These issues are all left for staged negotiations until 1998, when a permanent solution is intended, based on UN resolutions which realise 'the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and their just requirements'. As such, the interim agreement is a gamble for the Palestinians, as it contains no guarantees of further advances towards an independent Palestinian state in all of the pre-1967 Arab land. Gaza-Jericho is clearly designed by Israel as an experiment, the success of which will determine the shape of a future Palestine. Many Palestinians fear that 'Gaza-Jericho first' could end up being 'Gaza-Jericho only'. Under the agreement, the PLO is supposed to take control over Gaza-Jericho immediately. An advance contingent of 1,000 Palestinian police of a 9,000-strong force will cross into Gaza and Jericho today to pave the way for a phased Israeli troop withdrawal within 21 days. In the coming month, the PLO must take over executive power from the Israeli military administration and build the institutional structures for self-rule. The most important task is the appointment of a 'Palestinian interim self-government authority', to be composed of 24 members or 'ministers' led by Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, which will govern Gaza-Jericho until elections. Mr Arafat and his inner circle of senior PLO officials are expected to return to Gaza-Jericho within six weeks. The next steps of the peace process are much more complicated and ambiguous. The Declaration of Principles signed last September says implementation of the Gaza-Jericho accord is supposed immediately to be followed by negotiations on the second phase of the interim period: the extension of Palestinian self-government to the rest of the West Bank excluding Arab East Jerusalem. Under this phase, Israeli troops are supposed to move out of Palestinian population centres and make way for Palestinian policemen. The declaration says the second phase will be implemented after the PLO holds elections for a National Council on July 13 and the Israeli redeployment must be completed 'not later than the eve of elections'. On the inauguration of the Council, the civil administration will be dissolved and the Israeli military government withdrawn. The elections have to be held under a protocol to be negotiated by Israel and the PLO. However, it is already clear the elections will be long delayed and might even be indefinitely postponed. Furthermore, Israel has promised speedy talks on early transfer of power to Palestinians in the rest of the West Bank ahead of a formal agreement on extension of self-rule. Israeli officials clearly intend to drag out negotiations on the second phase of the agreement until they can assess how Gaza-Jericho has worked. For Israel success essentially means security: whether the PLO can curb attacks by Palestinian extremists on Israelis. If security is not increased there will be tremendous domestic pressure in Israel not to proceed. If Mr Arafat does not hold elections, Israel will be able to hide behind that excuse for not honouring its obligations in the declaration. Mr Rafi Ganzor, Israeli foreign ministry spokesman, said an appointed Palestinian Council and proof that Gaza-Jericho was working were conditions for beginning talks on the rest of the West Bank. Even if Gaza-Jericho goes well, complicated security negotiations for the 150 settlements and 120,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank could well mean implementation of the second phase will be delayed well into next year. The declaration also says negotiations on a permanent settlement to the Palestinian question - essentially statehood or confederation with Jordan - as well as the sensitive issue of Jewish settlements and the future of Jerusalem, are to be discussed not later than the beginning of the third year of Palestinian self-rule. Under the timetable laid out in the declaration, this would mean negotiations on permanent solutions would begin in December 1995 and would be implemented by December 1998. It is unclear how the five-month delay in implementing Gaza-Jericho and any future delays will affect the timetable.</p>

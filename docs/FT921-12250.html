			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Milk board launches co-op plan THE MILK Marketing Board for England and Wales yesterday launched plans to become a single voluntary co-operative with pooled prices. The plans, which follow two years of painfully slow progress towards reform, include the issue to milk producers of shares in Dairy Crest, the MMB's wholly-owned subsidiary with a 25 per cent stake in the UK's manufactured dairy products market. The Dairy Trade Federation, which represents dairies and processors and has resisted any MMB attempt to keep control of Dairy Crest, said: 'This is a major step forward. We strongly support the separation of Dairy Crest with its shares to be directly owned by dairy farmers'. The two sides have been locked in a stubborn contest about how the UK's 60-year-old cartel should be reformed to meet the challenge of the 1990s, particularly the single European market. Mr Bob Steven, chairman of the MMB, said yesterday the board would have preferred to maintain the old scheme, amended within a European context. However, change was inevitable, and the board's objective now was to create a worthwhile industry that gave farmers a chance to maintain their own destiny. Mr Andrew Dare, a former president of the DTF who shocked the industry by becoming an adviser to the MMB, said that shares in Dairy Crest would be given to existing milk producers on the basis of the milk they had supplied in the past over a given period. The shares would be tradeable among milk producers. The plan would give Dairy Crest clear objectives and put it on an equal footing with competitors, he said. The single voluntary co-op could be the strongest and most efficient marketing organisation in Europe. It would collect milk, pool it and pay the farmers monthly as now, as well as maintaining quality assurance. But at the end of the day the new co-op would only survive if it met its customers needs, Mr Dare said. Prices, now fixed according to what the milk is used for, would be set by an agreed pricing system 'to be discussed with the dairy trade, Maff (the agriculture ministry) and the European Commission,' the MMB said. Mr Steven said he would be surprised to see any legislation before the coming election.</p>

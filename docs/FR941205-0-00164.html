			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> However, the requirement for submission of the Questionnaire outlined in the Notice of Invitation and referred to in &sect;266.105(c) is critical to HUD's capacity to review applications. HFAs with a ``top-tier'' designation or ``A'' rating on their general obligation bonds from a national rating agency are subject to an intensive in-depth review of their operations, financial status, administrative capability and a host of other components comprising the other items on the Questionnaire by the rating agencies. Absent that review, HUD must make the same kind of analysis based on the Questionnaire, which is in a clear, concise and focused form. It also affords the HFA the opportunity to present their operations and capacity in a concise and positive way to the Department during the review process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The quality control plan supplements the other descriptive material submitted relative to underwriting standards and procedures, staff capacity, etc., by indicating the checks and balances within the HFA to ensure compliance with procedures and requirements whether performed by in-house staff or, more particularly, by contract personnel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 266.115&blank;Program monitoring and evaluation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Commenter 9 expressed a concern about the program allowing Level I participants to use their own underwriting criteria, fearing that it will make monitoring and reviewing by HUD more difficult. The commenter used the example of HUD's failure to adequately monitor coinsuring lenders who used HUD-established underwriting criteria and to impose sanctions when necessary. The commenter recommended that HUD reconsider its ability to monitor before delegating so much authority to third parties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenter 12 suggested that the &sect;266.115 requirement for semiannual reports is burdensome, and should be changed to annual reports. The commenter also believes that these reports should only contain information indicating a problem or workout. The commenter also suggested that annual physical inspection and audit reports be sent to HUD only in cases where the HFA determines there is a likelihood of a claim.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> HUD Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  With respect to Level I participants using their own underwriting criteria, the statute specifies that HFAs taking 50 percent or more of the risk (i.e., Level I participants) may use their own underwriting standards and loan terms and conditions. As to the comment on semiannual reports, the Department feels it is imperative that we be able to assess the progress and identify any impending problems through this reporting system. The data requested will also help HUD track other matters, such as MIP. Coupled with annual physical inspection reports and project audit reports, this data will aid HUD in meeting its oversight and monitoring responsibility to make its own informed decision as to whether there is a likelihood of a claim.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 266.120, 266.125&blank;Sanctions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Commenter 12 pointed out that &sect;266.120(e)(13) should be changed to make clear that Level I lenders cannot potentially be penalized for following their own underwriting standards. The commenter also recommended eliminating the provision in &sect;266.125(a)(4) that allows HUD to terminate insurance in cases of fraud or material misrepresentation by the HFA. The commenter fears that the provision will be unacceptable to bond holders or secondary mortgage market investors who will not be able to rely on the insurance. According to the commenter, the government's interests are adequately protected under &sect;266.125(a)(2) by the HFA being required to assume a higher risk level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> HUD Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Level I HFAs may use their own underwriting standards but must, nevertheless, also act prudently in accordance with generally accepted practices. This provision is not intended to penalize participants for plausible judgments about underwriting considerations but, rather, to prohibit the wide-scale abuse that occurred under the coinsurance program. We also note that the provision in &sect;266.125(a)(4) that allows HUD to terminate insurance in cases of fraud or material misrepresentation by the HFA is the same as for HUD-processed insurance programs under the National Housing Act. Projects insured under the National Housing Act are often bond-financed or sold on the secondary market, so this provision should not be unacceptable to bond holders or secondary markets. Moreover, two of the major rating agencies have thoroughly reviewed this program and have determined this provision, among others, to be satisfactory. They anticipate that they will be rating such loans with bond financing as AAA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

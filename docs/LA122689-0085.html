			<p><P> December 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ALASKA;  </P> <P> SATELLITES TO TRACK JUMBO OIL TANKERS  </P> <P> The Coast Guard will test a new system for tracking oil tankers in Alaska's  Prince William Sound, site of the nation's worst oil spill. It will utilize  satellite signals and long-range aids to navigation rather than radar, a Coast  Guard spokesman said. A satellite is a good tool for tracking "because it is  not affected by mountains, which is a problem in Alaska," the spokesman said.  He added that the reliability of radar was limited by weather. Tanker traffic  in Prince William Sound has been monitored by radar. But, when the Exxon Valdez  ran aground last March 24, it was beyond the area normally scanned by radar,  the Coast Guard said. The new system will be evaluated for a year in the sound  and 22 other ports and waterways around the country. Vessel owners will be  responsible for the cost of installing the "black boxes" that link up with the  system, a Coast Guard spokesman said.  </P></p>

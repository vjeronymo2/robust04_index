			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Cultural warriors misfiring: Jurek Martin finds the Bush campaign lagging in the polls again TO Congressman Newt Gingrich of Georgia, they can be likened to Woody Allen; to television evangelist Rev Pat Robertson they are agents of atheist lesbians; to California Attorney-General Dan Lungren, they would release convicted murderers in droves; to polemecist/politician Pat Buchanan, they are on the wrong side of a cultural and religious war, and want pre-teens to be able to sue their parents. To President George Bush, they are rarely to be mentioned by name, though inference is fine. For him they are, mostly by implication, mere physical cowards, enviromental terrorists and without God - but everything that everybody else says about them is just fine, too. They would also tax and spend as if there were no tomorrow - and enjoy it. The 'black hats' are, of course, Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, his wife Hillary, vice-presidential candidate Al Gore, and all the Democratic political barons in Congress. The 'white hats' are those with a different, more 'decent' and, naturally, Republican vision of what life in America should be about. Such is the great divide in the past week in the life of the US presidential election campaign. The basic question for the Bush campaign, as the fervour from the Republican convention in Houston last week dissipates, is whether or not it is barking up the wrong social tree by painting an exclusionary picture of an American society that has otherwise long been characterised as a melting-pot eternally susceptible to change. This may only be part of the broader election canvas, which also runs to more legitimate criticism of the opposition and to defence of the presidential record, especially in foreign policy. But the Republicans so far have chosen to make it a very substantial element. The early evidence is that this decision is not working. The New York Times/CBS poll yesterday not only found Mr Clinton's lead over Mr Bush widening again, to 51:36 per cent from the single digits of convention week, but it also revealed a public far more interested in what Mr Bush (and Mr Clinton) might have to say about the economy and health care than about issues, such as the rights of homosexuals and the promotion of religion and family values, that so dominated at Houston. Nor did the poll find much interest in the sort of changes in society that Mr Bush advocates - in effect a return to the traditional nuclear family around one male breadwinner, car-pooling and church. No fewer than 95 per cent of those surveyed agreed there was a need for 'real change in the way things are going in the country'. Only 15 per cent (and only a third of Mr Bush's supporters) thought the president could bring that about; 61 per cent thought Mr Clinton could. Only in the Deep South, where the fundamentalist strain runs deepest, and among Roman Catholics, those most exercised by abortion, had Mr Bush significantly trimmed his pre-convention deficit. Even Mr Robert Teeter, campaign chairman and a veteran pollster, conceded he thought that nationally Mr Bush was still behind 'about 50-40 per cent'. The president, on a personal approval rating still below 40 per cent, is reading and hearing with distressing frequency that no incumbent president has recovered from such depths so late in the campaign and won re-election. Earlier surveys this week from Time and Newsweek magazines had come to much the same conclusion. Time found only 10 per cent subscribing to the Republican party platform's view that abortion should be made illegal in all circumstances. An accompanying article quoted a construction company executive as saying he rated family values as a campaign issue behind 'counting all the sand on all the beaches in the world'. The nature of the Republican onslaught has given a field day to the president's critics. Mr George Will, conservative columnist, yesterday described the Bush campaign as an 'intellectual slum', with 'its riff-raff of liars and aspiring ayatollahs'. A New York Times editorial said that moderate Republicans and principled conservatives 'have every reason to worry about the drift of their party into the hands of those who would use faith as a cudgel'. The Bush campaign dismisses such criticism as a reflection of the liberal media's bias, though no liberal has ever claimed Mr Will as a soulmate. Moreover, the distaste expressed in print and on the air from both sides of the political divide does help shape public perceptions, as any listener to a radio talk show quickly discovers. The president had hoped he could get away by seeming above the most partisan and personal of the onslaughts, especially those directed at Mrs Clinton, portrayed as the ultimate radical feminist. But, since the convention, he has shared platforms with both Mr Gingrich and Rev Robertson, and expressed no visible dissent. Nor has the president dissociated himself in the slightest from the bleak description of cultural and religious warfare conjured up by Mr Buchanan, whose campaign in the Republican primary elections against Mr Bush, for what he used to call 'the soul of the Republican party', only attracted a quarter of the party electorate. The inevitable conclusion is that Mr Bush is being increasingly seen as a captive of the exclusionary religious and ideological right. This alone cannot win him another term in the White House. Another tactical shift in his campaign seems very probable.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the considerations discussed above, the Commission concludes that granting the proposed exemption will not increase the probability of an accident and will not result in any post-accident radiological releases significantly in excess of those previously determined for IP3. The proposed exemption would not otherwise affect radiological plant effluents, nor result in any significant occupational exposure. In addition, the exemption does not affect nonradiological plant effluents and has no other environmental impact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant radiological or nonradiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed exemption. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Alternatives to the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As an alternative to the proposed action, the Commission considered denial of the proposed action. Denial of the application would result in no change in current environmental impacts. The environmental impacts of the proposed action and the alternative action are similar. The alternative would also result in unwarranted expenditures of engineering and financial resources, and could significantly delay restart from the current outage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Alternate Use of Resources <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the ``Final Environmental Statement for the Indian Point Nuclear Generating Station Unit No. 3,'' dated February 1975. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Agencies and Persons Consulted <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission consulted with the State of New York regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Finding of No Significant Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed license amendment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For further details with respect to this action, see the application for exemption dated November 30, 1993.

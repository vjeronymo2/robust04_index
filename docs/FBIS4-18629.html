			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Commission Reacts to New U.S. Report </F> on Obstacles to Trade"; as released by Brussels EUROPE]    [Text] Brussels, 5 Apr 94 (AGENCE EUROPE) -- The European  Commission spokesman reacted with the following spoken comment  following the publication by the United States representative  for trade relations of the new American report on obstacles to  trade:    "1. The American report arrives before the Marrakesh  conference but the USTR [U.S. Trade Representative] is obliged  by the Trade Act of 1988 to submit this report each year no  later than 31 March. As usual, this report, which is the 9th,  takes stock of all the significant trade barriers, whether or  not in compliance with international rules.    ``2. Compared with last year, the 1994 report is  considerably better: Firstly, because there are few new  practices, secondly, because the United States recognizes that a  large number of problems are solved in the Uruguay Round,  thirdly, because it has a United States/European Union dialogue  that enables limiting and solving problems at their initial  stage, like for example, through the negotiation of agreements  for the mutual recognition of technical standards as well as  regulatory cooperation.    ``3. The Commission remains concerned about the particular  nature of Super 301 which makes this report the point of  departure of procedure 301 whose next step will be identifying  `priority practices' on 30 September 1994 which will determine  the future action of the USTR.    ``4. Likewise, the Commission is concerned about the  potential of application of unilateral measures which the USTR  might take on the basis of Title Seven of the Trade Act  (deadline 30 April 1994) and on the basis of Special 301  (deadline 30 May 1994) for public procurement and intellectual  property respectively.    ``5. In conclusion, all these American reports become an  ordinary event of the agenda of American trade policy. For  their part, the Commission's services limit themselves to a  single annual report, which should be out in the forthcoming  weeks.''    The following remarks can be made regarding this statement  by  the spokesman:     -  point 1 obviously aims to make less alarming  the fact that the United States has published a report of this  kind two weeks before the signature of the Uruguay Round. It is  not a blunder or intimidation on the part of the Americans but a  coincidence of dates imposed by the calendar of the 1988 Trade  Act. As for the Commission, it will publish its report on the  obstacles to trade practised by the United States (and by other  countries) after the Marrakesh meeting;    -  in point 2, underlining  that the American report denounces few "new practices," the  Commission obviously refers to the practices for which the  European Union is criticized (whereas Japan, for example, is the  subject of more numerous criticism);    -  point 3 must be understood  in the light of the Super 301 procedures. The indication of  obstacles to trade in the report will serve as a basis for the  implementation of other phases of the procedure: designation  before 30 September of countries which maintain obstacles  considered unacceptable; opening of negotiations with these  countries with a view to eliminating these obstacles; in case of  failed negotiations, possibilities for the United States to  introduce restrictive measures.    EUROPE adds that the new 281-page American report devotes 42  pages to Japan, 25 to the European Union, and the rest primarily  to China, South Korea, Russia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada,  Hungary, Mexico, Taiwan. The obstacles for which the European  Union are criticized are on the whole the same already indicated  in last year's report (particularly in the sector of public  procurement), with nevertheless particular emphasis on the  audiovisual sector. In the absence of provisions on this  subject in the framework of the Uruguay Round, the United States  is of the view that this sector falls under the application of  the general rules of the GATT forbidding restrictions and  discriminations, and they directly attack "broadcasting quotas"  for television and destination of taxes on video cassettes.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Lilian Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 30 (CNA) -- The government is seeking  ways to cut the growing trade deficit with Japan, including  setting up a holding company to produce key parts and components  here and cut Japanese imports of the products, the Ministry of  Economic Affairs said Monday [30 May].    The ministry officials said that Economics Minister P. K.  Chiang will meet with more than 60 entrepreneurs on June 14 to  promote the idea and seek investments in the holding company.    The ministry hopes that the holding company can come up with  NT [new Taiwan] $10 billion (US$370 million) in its first year.    The officials said that although guidelines to reduce the  trade deficit with Japan were established more than three years  ago, they have had little effect.    They said that studies indicate the key to reducing large  trade deficits lie in technology transfers. If the key parts  and components now imported from Japan can be produced here, the  deficit will fall.    The ministry is now screening 75 technology-intensive  Japanese products which cost more than US$75 million each to  import every year. The ministry will then choose ten of the  products for domestication.    The officials noted that they will take into consideration  domestic and foreign market demand, minimum investment and  possibility of technology transfer when selecting the 10  products.    The holding company will either produce the 10 products by  itself or seek cooperation with foreign partners.    Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan hit a record high of  US$14.42 billion in 1993 and is expected to reach US$15 billion  this year.</p>

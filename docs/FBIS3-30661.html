Meyer said that the fire, which occurred in one of the  transformers in the plant's third bloc, was completely  extinguished in two hours and did not cause any leak of  radioactive materials. The fire rated a zero on the INES  International Nuclear Safety Scale.    The Austrian environmental organization Global 2000,  however,  announced that Czech environmentalists from the Duha (Rainbow)  movement had informed them that the accident rated a three on  the INES scale. The environmentalists said that a secondary  cooling system had been damaged, causing a radioactive leak.  Local residents were warned by siren and doses of iodine were  distributed, the group said.</p>

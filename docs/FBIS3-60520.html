This latest report brings the total  number of patients reported from 1991 to the present to 1,524.    In 1993 alone, 1,100 cases have occurred. The patients who  died included a young man of 22 in San Jose Comayagua and two  children, four and 11 years of age, in Tegucigalpa.    The area most seriously affected by cholera continues to be  the southern zone, specifically the department of Choluteca,  where 166 of the 215 new cases occurred. After Choluteca, Valle  and Francisco Morazan are the areas most affected, while the  number of patients reported in Copan and Atlantida remains at  the normal level. Men accounted for 935 of the cases reported,  and women for 563.    Differing with the official figures, Maria del Carmen  Portillo, the coordinator of the Child Welfare and Development  Project of the Evangelical Committee of Development and National  Emergency (CEDEN), has reported that in El Triunfo, in the  department of Choluteca, 200 individuals have been infected with  cholera, and 62 have died.    The total number of patients infected by the Vibrio cholerae  in Choluteca, as reported by the CEDEN, is not included in the  official figures released by the Ministry of Public Health.  According to Portillo, an emergency exists in that locality  because of this disease.</p>

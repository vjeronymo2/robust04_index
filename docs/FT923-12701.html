			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets: Tel Aviv congratulates Labour on its victory - Hugh Carnegy describes the boost for equities The morning after Israel's general election on June 23, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) reacted as if bucket loads of mannah had just fallen from heaven. Prices shot ahead by more than 7 per cent in the first session in record volume. Three weeks later the market remains starry-eyed about the prospects for the economy under the new government. At yesterday's close the blue chip index had risen a further 2.84, or 1.8 per cent, on the day to 160.60, compared with 137.22 on the eve of the election. The fact that the election was won by Labour, historically the party of state socialism in Israel, caused investors no pause. They are convinced that modern-day Labour will accelerate the process of deregulation (foreigners are now free to invest on the TASE) that moved slowly under the previous Likud government. Mr Saul Bronfeld, the TASE chief executive, says: 'Today Labour is supported more by the middle classes and the business sector, while the Likud tends to represent the less privileged parts of society, so the old labels are really very misleading.' The markets also believe Labour will restore battered relations with the US, allowing the release of Dollars 10bn in US loan guarantees, which are seen as vital to generating long-term growth in the immigration-burdened economy. If welcoming a Labour government seems paradoxical, there is another apparent contradiction in the performance of the TASE. Even before the election, the market had been on a marked upward swing for three full years  -interrupted only during the Gulf crisis of 1990-91 - in spite of the clear strains that mass immigration from the former Soviet Union was placing on the economy. Per capita growth has been negligible, unemployment is at record levels and the all-important export sector has been performing sluggishly. Again, Mr Bronfeld says there is no contradiction in this. TASE-listed companies have benefited from the growth in domestic demand, from falling labour costs associated with rising unemployment and by a government-backed trend of declining real interest rates. According to TASE figures, average return on capital among listed industrial companies rose from 1.3 per cent in 1988, to 9.4 per cent last year. In the first quarter of 1992 the figure was up to 14.4 per cent. There is another factor at work, however, which distorts TASE performance and may be engendering unrealistic overvaluation of some companies. The share market is relatively small, with a market capitalisation of Shk55bn (Dollars 22.9bn). The government bond market is worth Shk66bn and private bonds Shk10bn. On the equity market, what is traded is only a small part of the total as ownership of the majority of shares is closely held. Mr Mark Meiras, an indepen-dent analyst, says that even the record turnover in June represented only about 3 per cent of all shares changing hands annually, compared with four or five times in other world markets. Meanwhile, says Mr Meiras: 'There is a hell of a lot of money flying about.' Israel's providential funds, now less bound by regulations to invest in government securities, have assets of Shk60bn, of which only Shk3bn are in equities. Last year was a record for new share issues on the TASE, totalling Shk1.9bn. Already this year, new issues have passed Shk2bn, as the government has at last begun to float shares in state companies such as Bezeq, the telecoms monopoly, and Israeli Chemicals. 'But supply still nowhere near satisfies demand,' says Mr Meiras. The market's hope - and expectation - is that the new government will accelerate privatisation issues to soak up some of this demand. State holdings in the utilities, companies such as the El Al airline, and the oil refineries and the country's four big banks, could be worth several billion shekels. The more worrying trend as far as the TASE is concerned is a growing tendency for Israel's star high-tech companies, such as Scitex, the computer printing specialist, and ECI Telecom, to prefer North American exchanges where their main markets lie. Israeli companies raised more than Dollars 500m in New York issues last year. Mr Bronfeld admits this is worrying for the TASE. He is therefore trying hard to persuade companies such as Tadiran, an electronics maker, and Zim, the government-controlled merchant shipping concern, to balance their plans for a New York listing with a dual listing in Tel Aviv.</p>

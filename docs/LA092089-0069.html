			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FUND THAT INSURES BANKS IS HEALTHY, U.S. OFFICIALS ASSURE  </P> <P> The federal fund that insures commercial bank deposits is not in any danger of  collapsing as the savings and loan insurance fund did, government banking  officials said Tuesday.  </P> <P> But two private analysts said more than two dozen banks were operating with  liabilities greater than their assets and should be closed.  </P> <P> The regulators, testifying before the House banking subcommittee on financial  institutions, rejected that assertion and said their policy is to close  insolvent banks.  </P> <P> "The bank insurance fund is solvent and can meet the obligations as we foresee  them today," Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman said.  </P> <P> Congress adopted legislation in August to bail out the Federal Savings and Loan  Insurance Corp., which will cost taxpayers more than $200 billion over 30  years.  </P> <P> Seidman testified that the FDIC fund had a net worth of $14.1 billion after  losses of $6.3 billion last year.  </P> <P> While economic conditions could change, he and the other officials said they  were cautiously optimistic about the outlook for banks.  </P> <P> But a proposal by Comptroller of the Currency Robert Clarke was criticized by  members of the panel who said it would weaken capital rules for banks and  endanger the fund.  </P> <P> Clarke has proposed that in addition to new international risk-based capital  rules, U.S. banks have minimum capital of 3% of their liabilities.  </P></p>

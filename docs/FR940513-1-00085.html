			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Alyeska estimated that the additional amount of energy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that could be conserved by recovering (instead of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incinerating) tanker vapors at the VMT would be as great or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greater than the energy that could be saved by recovering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tanker vapors at all other U.S. crude oil loading marine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terminals combined (about 250,000 barrels at current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> throughput). Both recovery and incineration result in other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> air pollutants including particulate matter (PM), sulfur  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oxides (SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), nitrogen oxides (NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), carbon monoxide (CO),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and carbon dioxide (CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). Vapor recovery may be more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advantageous when considering the overall contribution of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all pollutants to the environment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed standard does not treat a facility such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the VMT as a separate category or subcategory. However, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is still considering whether these characteristics  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described above are sufficient to warrant treatment of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility like the VMT as a separate subcategory, and is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requesting additional information and public comments on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this issue. Comment is also requested on the extent to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which these factors, largely related to recovery devices,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be considered if such a facility can use an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incinerator. Additional information is sought on the extent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to which factors such as a different detonator device are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relevant to the decision. The EPA also invites comment on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alyeska's suggestion that a VOC reduction requirement less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stringent than 95 percent is appropriate for a terminal in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an ozone attainment area in an extreme northern climate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where ozone formation is not a practical concern. The EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will evaluate all information and comments submitted in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> making a final determination before promulgation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alyeska states that diminishing throughput could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eliminate the need for control equipment at all berths in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the future; if throughput continues to decline, the VMT will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eventually be able to handle the entire throughput at only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two berths instead of the four available berths. Alyeska  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has raised an issue concerning the need to control the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> berths normally not in use if they are used for ``emergency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes.'' The issue is independent of the choice of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control systems and would not be considered in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination of whether it is appropriate to put the VMT in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a separate subcategory. However, the EPA may evaluate a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory approach which requires full control of emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at the primary loading berths, but allows occasional use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uncontrolled berths. This type of regulatory scenario  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumes that emissions from the uncontrolled berths would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negligible when compared to emissions to the controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> berths. For the EPA to evaluate such an approach requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VMT to provide detailed information on the impacts and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tradeoffs for various scenarios of the controlled versus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uncontrolled berths. The EPA is requesting comments on this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> type of approach, including the need to limit frequency of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use or mass emissions, and the details that should be in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule to ensure compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If facilities with characteristics like the VMT were in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a separate subcategory, the MACT floor would appear to be no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control. The EPA would consider requiring control levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more stringent than the MACT floor. The tradeoffs between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incineration and vapor recovery would be considered in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination, and also in the determination of RACT under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 183(f). The declining throughput and its affect on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the number of berths would also be considered in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alyeska is still studying the total impacts associated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with vapor recovery systems. Currently, Alyeska has not yet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided the EPA with the control efficiency of the recovery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process, the energy requirements, costs, or the secondary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pollutants associated with recovery; nor has Alyeska  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided evidence showing that a 93 or 95 percent reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in emissions of HAP using a recovery device is infeasible at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VMT. Moreover, given that the EPA's definition of VOC does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not include methane and ethane, there is some question as to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether a 95 percent reduction in VOC is in fact possible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using recovery at the VMT. Additional information is also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needed on the declining throughput, its effect on the number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of berths controlled, and the tradeoffs involved. The EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could possibly consider the trade-offs among HAP, VOC, PM,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , CO and CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in addition to energy savings when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluating recovery versus incineration. The EPA invites  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment on whether a regulatory approach that would allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the use of a less stringent vapor recovery system at the VMT  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is permissible and appropriate under the Act. Such comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should include the consideration of tradeoffs between HAP,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other pollutants, energy, and whether consideration of such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tradeoffs is permissible under sections 112 and 183(f).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Before promulgating a final rule, the EPA will evaluate all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional information, data, and comments submitted. Based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on this evaluation, the promulgated standards could be set  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at the proposed RACT and MACT levels, but the EPA will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examine all information relevant to including a separate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subcategory for large crude terminals and establishing a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different MACT level for each subcategory.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

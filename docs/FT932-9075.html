			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / UK Company News: BM distribution arm up for sale BM GROUP, the engineering concern in refinancing talks with bankers, is preparing to shed all or part of its global distribution business in an attempt to reduce the more than Pounds 105m debt. The group, which has negotiated finance facilities until next month with a consortium of 11 banks, is in talks with up to five parties. Discussions ranged from an outright sale, dilution or the formation of joint ventures. BM is understood to be talking to several Japanese companies, including Hitachi, Marubeni - a trading house linked to Komatsu - and Tadano. These three groups are already joint venture partners in BM's Australian distribution business. Executives of the group's UK distribution businesses are also seeking to organise a management buy-out of the European operations. Mr Howard Sutton, chief executive, denied that the banks had forced a sale. 'It is our intention and requirement to reduce the borrowing levels,' he said. 'There is no timescale.' BM distributes construction equipment around the world for manufacturers such as Hitachi, Komastu and Ingersoll Rand. The businesses, which cover North America, Europe, Africa and the Far East, have a net asset value of Pounds 85.9m and total debt and financial commitments of Pounds 39.3m. The construction equipment operations incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 600,000 on sales of Pounds 125m in the six months to December 31. The sale of the distribution arm would include the Blackwood Hodge businesses purchased for Pounds 54m in 1990. BM would be left with an engineering business in the UK and US, with annual turnover of about Pounds 300m. The group's shares closed last night firm at 24 1/2 p.</p>

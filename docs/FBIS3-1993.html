This is an important  economic law for improving state macrocontrol, developing a  market system, standardizing the practices of fixing prices,  promoting open and fair trade, and safeguarding consumers'  legitimate rights and interests.    Under the situation of the socialist market economy,  reasonable market prices and market operation must be based on  open, fair, and orderly market competition. At present, the  market system is yet to be developed and trade regulations  remain imperfect with the result that some businessmen demand  exorbitant prices for their goods, cheat customers, and sell  bogus goods. The situation in which the quality of goods does  not agree with their prices is so serious that it has aroused  strong resentment among the general public. According to the  "Regulations," all enterprises, administrative and institutional  units, and individuals must clearly mark prices for their  commodities and services, transaction accounts must be settled  in terms of knock-down prices, no goods shall sell at a price  higher than the marked price and no surcharges shall be  collected, specific items and prices must be listed on invoices,  and punishment must be meted out to those businessmen and those  units providing service which violate the "Regulations." The  regulations will help increase the transparency of prices and  make transactions more open. In this way, the malpractice of  cheating customers with prices will be curbed to a certain  degree, the market will be subject to supervision by the public,  the legitimate rights and interests of consumers and operators  will be safeguarded, and an open, fair, and orderly market  competition will take shape.    With the deepening of the economic restructuring, prices for  most commodities and services have been open to market forces  and thus greatly increased the marketization of the economy.  However, freeing prices does not mean the government will  refuse to have anything more to do with the market. Rather, the  government will exercise indirect and macro-control over the  market by economic, legal, and necessary administrative means.  Since the "Regulations" will keep the public aware of the  process of fixing prices by producers and operators, they will  help the government timely and accurately monitor market prices  and thus formulate scientific macrocontrol measures, which will  guide the operation of producers and operators in the right  direction and effect a rational allocation of resources. In the  meantime, the "Regulations" will also keep the public aware of  the process of fixing service charges by administrative and  institutional units so that the government will improve  administration and put a end to unauthorized charges.    The enterprise is the main body of market competition and  the  core of market competition is price. Fixing prices in  accordance with the "Regulations" will help enterprises have  access to information about commodity prices so they will  formulate correct price strategies for entering market  competition. The "Regulations" will also enable enterprises to  learn their strong points and weaknesses through competition in  the market to improve management, increase efficiency, and  develop the capacity to meet emergencies.    The "Regulations" provide consumers with a legal basis for  safeguarding their rights and interests, enabling them to  compare prices offered by different vendors, and to get good  value for their money. Under the "Regulations," the broad  masses of the people will supervise the practice of demanding  prices for commodities and report any fraud to the government  department concerned for investigation and punishment.    Governments and departments in charge of prices at all  levels  must conscientiously implement the regulations and work toward  the point where when there is a law it is observed, enforcement  is strict, and lawbreakers are prosecuted. All producers,  operators, and units providing services must enhance their  awareness of the need to abide by laws, consciously observe  relevant rules and regulations, and set to others an example of  observing discipline and abiding by the law. The broad masses  of shoppers are expected to supervise implementation of the  regulations. Let us make concerted efforts to implement these  regulations to the letter to promote the formation of a market  order featuring fair transactions and fair competition.</p>

			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Working Life: Both sides of using credit cards on holiday - Finance If you are yet to go on holiday and convenience is your byword, then a credit card is the handiest way of taking cash abroad. Apart from being easy to slip into a pocket, credit cards score because they are usually better value than the alternatives. You should be able to buy more goods and services using a credit card than other type of holiday money. Although the commission on credit card transactions tends to be heftier, particularly for drawing cash, it is usually offset by a more favourable exchange rate. The worst value is usually cash, which tends to have the most unfavourable exchange rates, while travellers cheques and Eurocheques rate roughly equally in terms of value. However, depending on a single credit card as holiday cash can be unwise. To begin with, credit cards are only readily acceptable in some countries in Europe and the US. You may find that although it is easy enough to pay a hotel or restaurant bill in large cities, elsewhere smaller towns or shops may not accept them. Even in continental Europe there may be problems. Germany prefers its own bank cards. Different technology incorporated to beat fraud in cards issued in France, means that British travellers may find their Visa cards rejected or even swallowed by cash dispensers, automatic vending machines and stores. Fraud can also be a nasty problem, as unscrupulous shop keepers or restaurateurs can run off extra vouchers. Before you leave home, make the supreme effort of finding and noting down the issuer's emergency telephone number, along with your card number and expiry date. Most card issuers limit a customer's liability to Pounds 50 - the amount set by the Consumer Credit Act. Scheherazade Daneshkhu</p>

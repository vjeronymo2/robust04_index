			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / International Company News: Troubled Torras names new executive board GROUP TORRAS, the Spanish investment arm of the Kuwait Investment Office, has named a four-man board to run its troubled industrial empire in Spain. This fulfils a pledge made to the Madrid government two weeks ago following the KIO's decision to place Torras in receivership. Two Kuwaitis, Mr Mahmoud Al-Nouri, Torras' current deputy chairman, and Mr Al-Mousherji, were appointed to the new executive committee together with two Spaniards, Mr Luis Vano, Torras' director general, and Mr Jose Luis Lopez Sanchez, a lawyer. The board will replace two partners of the accountants KPMG Peat Marwick who had been placed in charge of Torras' management after the receivership application, although both auditing consultants will remain close to the holding company as administrators of its receivership process. Spain's industry minister had requested a four-man board last month, equally composed of Kuwaitis and Spaniards, in order to negotiate Torras' staged withdrawal from Spain. Although the Madrid administration had hoped a high-ranking official of the KIO would join the board - both Nr Al-Nouri and Mr Al-Mousherji are external advisers to the office - the development was viewed as positive and a prelude to the wind-up talks.</p>

Geydar Aliyev noted that this meeting was important because  it emphasized the need to resolve problems stemming from  existing conditions that concern both countries.    The Azerbaijani president expressed his satisfaction at the  recently improving relations between Azerbaijan and Russia. He  noted that such relations are in the interest of both countries.    Geydar Aliyev drew the Russian ambassador's attention to the  undeniable fact that representatives of various nationalities  are fighting in the ranks of Armenia's occupationist army. This  shows that the soldiers and officers from the 127th Army based  in Armenia are participating in the aggression against  Azerbaijan in the ranks of the occupationist troops.    The Azerbaijani president reiterated that despite the  extremely tense situation, our Republic favors the peaceful  resolution of the problem. Whereas, Armenia not only always  undermines peace efforts and fails to abide by the previous  agreements, it broadens the scope of the aggression.    The Azerbaijani president then referred to the National  Assembly debate on the 20 January 1990 tragedy and said that the  position of some opposition deputies, who blame the Russian Army  and the Russians for this tragedy, can be justified. Those  events were the result of the objectives being pursued by the  former imperialism and communist regime. The Azerbaijani  leadership at that time was guilty in this incident. Those who  put the blame on outsiders want to absolve themselves from their  own responsibility in the tragedy.    In his turn, the Russian ambassador expressed his views on  matters of mutual interest.</p>

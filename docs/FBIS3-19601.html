			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Angelo Lupoli: "Maneuvers Round the Corner"] </F>   [Text] Rome -- Despite the efforts which have been made,  the accounts do not balance: The budget deficit is set to widen  during the year, even if 1993 brought a slight improvement. In  fact, not all the objectives set by the government are easily  attainable and the impact of the economic crisis is weighing  more heavily than expected.    Pending publication of the quarterly figures, however, no  one  is hazarding to advance numbers, even if recourse to a new  economic maneuver already appears inevitable. Yesterday both  the ABI [Italian Bankers Association] and the European  Commission confirmed that Italians will be called on to make  certain sacrifices in 1994. But the choice of measures will  fall to the government which will be formed after 27 March.    The status of the public finances was set out on Tuesday [15  March] at Palazzo Chigi [government seat] where Auditor General  Andrea Monorchio met Prime Minister Carlo Azegli Ciampi.  Conversations focused on the quarterly report, which could be  available as early as the beginning of next week, with very  positive accounts thanks to Ciampi's belt-tightening on  expenditures.    The prime minister and the economics ministers have not  fallen prey to easy enthusiasm. The first quarter's good  performance, however, is only temporary and the benefits could  be lost in the coming months.    In fact, according to initial projections, there could be a  shortfall of 5 trillion lire in the 1994 objective of 446  trillion in tax receipts, while the 10 trillion of "savings"  which the Cassese package is supposed to bring about will be  difficult to achieve. In short, the shortfall, as already  underlined by the IMF, is likely to be on the order of 15  trillion, which will have to be through an ad hoc maneuver: due  in part at least to the lower cuts achieved in spending. The  ABI too confirms this supposition in its monthly report: For  the banks, the failure to meet the budget deficit objective and  the slow economic recovery make it impossible to contain 1994  requirements at 144 trillion.    The path to be taken in order to get the public accounts  back  on track, is not, however, indicated, even if the new government  will have very limited room for maneuver. Imposing new taxes is  out of the question. Fiscal pressure, as the IMF itself has  pointed out, is too high. The only measures which are open  relate to the contents of public expenditures, and in  particular, the revision of the resources earmarked for social  security. A decision which is considered unpopular and not  pursuable in tight times.    The need for a new public finance measure is not, however,  viewed with particular concern by the European Union. "Italy's  public accounts are on the right track: There should not be  particular problems in the granting of the third installment of  the Community's 8 billion ECU balance of payments loan, Giovanni  Ravasio, the Commission's Director General of Economic Affairs  explained. "For the granting of the third installment of the  loan we have agreed with the Italian Government that we will  examine the situation in April- May. Once the accounts for the  first three months of the year are known," Ravasio continued,  "we will assess whether, and to what extent, it will be  necessary to rebalance the public accounts in order to attain  the objectives already agreed between the Community and the  Italian Government". He added that "it may be that some  adjustment will be necessary, but it will be a totally bearable  one, within the reach of the government and citizens."    The Commission will also have to assess the effect of the  recession on tax receipts. "From the first, partial indications  available to us," the Commission's director general for economic  affairs went on, "it would appear that the situation has not  become worse. Therefore, I believe that achieving the planned  target is within the government's capacity. The data on the  deficit, for the first months of the year, are better than  forecast. We do not yet have the details, and we cannot, for  the time being, attribute this improvement with certainty to  improved receipts or to a slowing down of public expenditure."    The year 1993 also closed with an improvement: The deficit  amounted to 153,539 billion compared with a requirement of  158,840 billion in 1992, calculated according to the new version  which excludes public agencies which have been converted into  limited liability companies. At the end of the financial year,  the tax offices recorded final receipts of 510,630 billion,  compared with final expenditure of 650,180 billion, with a net  balance to be financed of 148,550 billion. To this must be  added a 4,989 billion deficit relating to treasury management  operations.</p>

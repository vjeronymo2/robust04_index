			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Euro Disney The business plan for Euro Disney is in suspended animation while the accountants check that the company's famous imagination has not run away with it. Serious negotiation between the company and its banks will thus have to wait for the hard numbers. Yet Mr Michael Eisner, Walt Disney's chairman, seems happy to carry on with his campaign of megaphone diplomacy in the meantime. The banks have to weigh the damage to the Disney image if it walked away from the park against the parent company's very limited financial exposure. So Mr Eisner has every reason to soften the banks up as much as possible. He also has a much more frightening audience closer to home. Walt Disney stockholders are already grumbling about their chairman handing out money to European banks. Still, some battle lines are clear. Euro Disney's operational cash flow is slightly positive, and some further cost savings may be possible. But in the absence of a strong upturn in attendances, the park is not going to generate enough cash to service any great quantity of debt or equity. It is hard to see a rights issue raising more than FFr5bn-FFr6bn, since that would require at least a one-for-one issue. Even that would not cut Euro Disney's FFr21bn debt by enough to put the park on a firm footing. A write-off of a further FFr5bn of bank debt would still leave the company in loss for 1993-94, but would offer hope thereafter. The banks, however, are likely to want equity in return, further diluting existing shareholders. To put any sparkle of value back into the shares, a fairy godmother will have to acquire the park's half-empty hotels.</p>

			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WEEK AHEAD  </P> <P> * MARCH TO YOUR OWN BEAT: From star-studded tradition to offbeat kookiness,  three parades planned for today should offer a little something for everyone.  The 58th Annual Hollywood Christmas Parade led by Grand Marshal Sammy Davis Jr.  kicks off at 6 p.m. at Van Ness Avenue and Sunset Boulevard. The 14th  Occasional Doo-Dah Parade, a spoof of the Tournament of Roses, will take over  Pasadena's streets from noon to 2 p.m. And the East Los Angeles Parade will run  from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. along Whittier and Atlantic boulevards.  </P> <P> * CRUISE WITH SANTA: A double-decker bus, provided by the Hollywood Chamber of  Commerce, will carry Santa Claus, a choir and a different high school band  along Hollywood Boulevard every night for the next 19 days starting Monday.  </P> <P> * SATAN SLEUTHS: Parents who want to ban a textbook because they believe it  contains satanic material will present their grievances to officials of the  East Whittier School District on Monday at 7 p.m. at East Whittier Middle  School.  </P> <P> * STRANGE MACHINATIONS: Engineering students at Caltech will compete Thursday  to see who can build the best ping-pong-ball-collecting machine from a bag of  assorted springs, plexiglass, tubing and electric motors provided by their  instructor. The 4th Annual Caltech Engineering Design Contest gets underway at  2 p.m. in the Baxter Lecture Hall in Pasadena.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WALL STREET / JOHN CRUDELE: INVESTOR SIMMONS MAY BE MAKING MOVE ON LOCKHEED  </P> <P> What does Harold Simmons, the billionaire Texas investor, really have in mind  for Lockheed Corp.?  </P> <P> Simmons currently owns around $280 million worth of the Calabasas-based  aerospace company's stock. But he has confused Wall Street over the past few  months by selling some of his Lockheed holdings.  </P> <P> Michael Lamb, president of Wealth Monitors Inc., a Kansas City, Mo., investment  advisory firm, has been studying Simmons' moves and thinks that he has the guy  figured out.  </P> <P> "I think Simmons wants to own and control Lockheed eventually," Lamb concludes.  </P> <P> Then why has Simmons sold some of his Lockheed stock?  </P> <P> Here, chronologically, is what Lamb thinks happened  </P> <P> April 3: Simmons holds 5.3% of Lockheed's stock. At this point, Wall Street  figures that the company -- although it has a market value of about $3 billion  -- is vulnerable to a takeover.  </P> <P> April 4: Lockheed announces a major restructuring that includes the  establishment of an employee stock ownership plan and the sale of some assets.  </P> <P> April 4: Simmons says he might sell some stock, and that same day unloads  200,000 shares. That brings his total holdings down to 4.9% of Lockheed's  shares (4.2% after his holdings are diluted by the establishment of the ESOP by  Lockheed). Wall Street figures, at this point, that Simmons is being scared  away.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Buys More Shares  </P> <P> Lamb thinks that Simmons purposely wanted to get his holdings under 5% so that  he wouldn't be required to publicly disclose to the Securities and Exchange  Commission certain discussions about Lockheed. "Simmons at this point went into  the shadows," Lamb says.  </P> <P> May 15: Simmons meets with Lockheed's management. Nothing is known about the  meeting because Simmons -- who at this point still owns less than 5% of  Lockheed's shares -- isn't required to disclose what was discussed. "That same  day, Simmons started buying for a solid month, except for one day, May 16,"  says Lamb.  </P> <P> Between May 15 and June 8, Lamb says Simmons bought $69 million worth of  Lockheed stock. And from June 9 to July 17, he bought another $34 million worth  of stock.  </P> <P> Aug. 1: Simmons reports that he purchased another 909,100 shares of Lockheed,  bringing his total to 6,007,200, or 9.46%.  </P> <P> "He now has $280 million in Lockheed, his biggest investment ever," says Lamb.  "He wants to own this company. He's been sitting with $4 billion in borrowing  power for two years."  </P> <P> Lamb's view is unconventional. Most people on Wall Street still think that  Lockheed is too big for Simmons to take over. And the government would be very  reluctant to allow a corporate raider to bother an important defense contractor  like Lockheed.  </P> <P> Because of that, Lockheed's stock has not reacted much to Simmons' buying  pressure.  </P> <P> Lockheed does have one thing that could make it vulnerable. The company has a  very over-funded pension fund that could attract a corporate raider.  </P> <P> If Lamb is right about Simmons action, he will have solved one of Wall Street  biggest mysteries. Simmons, in the eyes of Wall Street, wouldn't be fickle.  He'd be smart.  </P> <P> The way that Wall Street sees it, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan  is a little like the pilot of the jet that crashed in Iowa. His steering  mechanism isn't functioning, so he has to speed up or slow down his engines to  go in a straight line.  </P> <P> Greenspan, of course, is controlling the economy. He gunned the interest rate  engine early this year when it looked like inflation was getting out of hand.  And now he's revving up the economy by lowering interest rates because he's  worried about a recession.  </P> <P> The big question is, can Greenspan keep this baby flying? The financial markets  apparently think that he can, or else bonds wouldn't have risen as much as they  have this year and the stock market wouldn't be up 8% in July alone.  </P> <P> But some experts think that the financial markets are playing with fire. Even  if Greenspan can successfully keep the economy humming for a while at a most  desirable moderate-growth, moderate-inflation pace, most experts agree that  Greenspan has not found a cure to the common recession. And when that recession  does come -- whether it is later this year, next year or the year after that --  the stock market will not like it.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Recession Scare  </P> <P> (In testimony last week, even Greenspan admitted that he won't know if he's  avoided a recession until well into next year.)  </P> <P> "I find it very curious. You are dealing with a study in mass psychology," says  Jon Groveman, president of Ladenburg, Thalmann &amp; Co., referring to the  stock market's recent ascent. "People are buying stocks because they are going  up, rather than buying them in the expectation that earnings are going to  improve. And that could be dangerous."  </P> <P> In fact, Groveman and others worry that the more stocks go up, the more  treacherous it will be when the markets start reacting to fears of a recession.  Just how dangerous the recession scare can be was witnessed during the last  week of June, when the Dow Jones industrial index fell a quick 92 points on  worries that the economy was slowing too much.  </P> <P> The markets were acting skittish again this past week, especially on Tuesday,  when signs that the economy is continuing to slow began to reappear.  </P> <P> Richard Hoey, chief economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert, thinks that the  markets have been reacting correctly -- if they think that Greenspan has the  magic touch and can execute the so-called "soft landing" for the economy. Since  the Federal Reserve has been easing interest rates lately, Hoey thinks  Greenspan may actually be able to avoid a recession in 1989.  </P> <P> But Hoey thinks that a recession will start soon -- probably in the middle of  1990. The Fed, he believes, is laying the groundwork right now by loosening  interest rates. That move will cause an aggravation of inflation and the need  for higher interest rates before next year's recession.  </P> <P> Donald Straszheim, head economist at Merrill Lynch, sees things a little  differently. He thinks that the recession is already starting and that the  nation's gross national product will fall this quarter and next.  </P> <P> But Straszheim also believes that the financial markets will ignore the  recession. "I think the market will look right through the period of weakness,"  says Straszheim, focusing instead on the economic recovery he that predicts in  early 1990.  </P> <P> So place your bets. Will the economy go into that recession? And, can the  financial markets really ignore the problems that businesses will have and  continue to move higher?  </P> <P> Three major drug companies have already agreed to be acquired in the past few  months, and experts say more consolidations are likely in that industry.  </P> <P> For the investor looking to make a killing from one of these upcoming  takeovers, the only trick is to own stock in the company being acquired (which  will go up) and not the one doing the acquiring (which, likely, will go down).  </P> <P> Industry analysts think Pfizer Inc., Rorer Group, Upjohn Co., Warner-Lambert  Co. and Syntex Corp. are the most likely drug companies to be acquired.  American Home Products, a drug company that is also involved in other business,  could also be vulnerable.  </P> <P> You would probably be wasting your time and money on Glaxo Holdings, Merck  &amp; Co., Eli Lilly Co., Johnson &amp; Johnson or Hoffmann-LaRoche, the  analysts say. These five will more likely be the ones doing the acquiring  rather than be the companies bought.  </P> <P> But analyst aren't even willing to concede that these five industry giants are  safe. As David Saks of Wedbush Morgan Securities says, all the rules have  already been broken regarding mergers in the drug industry, so "now any idea  makes sense."  </P> <P> Further down the road, analysts say, biotechnology companies could come under  attack. But the attractiveness of these biotech firms to drug or chemical  companies will depend greatly on the biotech firm's ability to translate  scientific discoveries into useable products.  </P> <P> Smith Barney restricted its salespeople from buying Midway Airlines stock last  week. A spokesman, however, wouldn't say whether it was because the brokerage  firm was representing a corporate raider who might go after Midway, a  Chicago-based airline. Midway's stock has been trading very heavily for more  than a week. . . .  </P> <P> All those speculators waiting for Paramount Communications' next hostile  takeover attempt had better make themselves comfortable. A Wall Street source  familiar with Paramount says the company never had a contingency takeover  target in the event -- as happened -- that it didn't get to acquire Time Inc.  Paramount's chief executive, Martin Davis, moreover, would be reluctant to  attempt another unfriendly takeover so soon, the source says. The source thinks  that the next deal for Paramount will be a friendly one. . . .  </P> <P> Is someone after Conrail? Last week, Conrail -- also known as Consolidated Rail  Corp. -- established an employee stock ownership program. The week before that,  the company raised its common stock dividend. Both are viewed by Wall Street as  defensive measures against a takeover, confirming an earlier report in this  column about the company's nervousness. But is someone really after the  company, which is protected legislatively from takeovers until early next year,  or is Conrail just paranoid? A source on Wall Street says Conrail spotted some  suspicious buying of its stock a few months ago coming out of Chicago and  thinks that someone may be accumulating its shares. . . .  </P></p>

			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Coal Invs plans to raise Pounds 11.5m for development Coal Investments, formerly known as Geevor, plans to raise Pounds 11.5m to develop two pits for which it has agreed terms with British Coal to mine for 15 years. It will raise Pounds 3.5m through the issue of loan stock to shareholders and Pounds 8m through new shares at 65p, half of which will be placed and half distributed through a 1-for-8 rights issue. The shares were suspended at 76p three weeks ago, pending talks with British Coal and the financial arrangements announced yesterday. Dealings are expected to resume on March 28 following an extraordinary meeting. The two pits, Hem Heath, part of the Trentham mine, and Coventry, will be among the first to be licensed by British Coal. Coal Investments is also the front runner for the lease to mine Markham Main colliery in South Yorkshire and may bid for two others. The company started mining coal yesterday at Cwmgwili, south Wales, its only working pit. It plans to produce 120,000 tonnes a year and to make slightly more than Pounds 1m in operating profits on turnover of Pounds 6m at the mine, ahead of previous budgets. The arrangements announced yesterday will lead to the issue of 12m shares. In addition shareholders will receive warrants to buy one share at 85p for every four shares they take up in the rights. Shareholders will also be able to subscribe for zero coupon loan stock which will repay Pounds 1 for each 60p paid, equivalent to a gross yield of 13 per cent. The stock will also have warrants attached. COMMENT As former commercial director of British Coal, Mr Malcolm Edwards, the chairman, has a strong background in sales techniques, which has stood him in good stead at Coal Investments. His ability to sell the potential coal, not to mention the story, of Coal Investments has been crucial in the shares rising by more than four times in the first five months after its re-incarnation. He sounded convincing again yesterday as he spoke of how his company could rely on sales of at least 2m to 3m tonnes a year by concentrating on industrial and household markets: sales to electricity generators would be additional. We will have to wait to see if this is fulfilled. The company does not expect to be making money until the year after next. Charles Stanley, its broker, believes at least Pounds 2.7m is likely for the year ending March 1996, putting the shares on a prospective p/e for that year of 11. These are early days yet and the uncertainty of a declining coal market means that the rights issue is not one for those with limited funds. But the company's cash generative potential and its relatively small capitalisation may prove attractive for institutions which can bear some risk in their portfolios.</p>

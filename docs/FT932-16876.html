			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Leyland Daf rescue suffers double blow EFFORTS to rescue Leyland Daf, the beleaguered UK truck and van maker, suffered two serious setbacks yesterday. One of the company's main components suppliers, Automotive Products, announced that it had stopped delivering crucial components to the Leyland Daf plants. It also emerged that Iveco Ford Truck, Leyland Daf's main rival in the UK, is seeking to persuade 11 of Leyland Daf's 52 main dealers to change franchise. Mr Murdoch McKillop and Mr John Talbot, the joint administrative receivers for Leyland Daf, failed in the High Court yesterday to gain an order compelling Automotive Products to continue supplying components, chiefly brake assemblies and clutches, to the truck-assembly plant at Leyland, Lancashire, and to the van plant in Birmingham. The receivers warned that production could be halted at the van plant as early as Monday and truck assembly could be stopped by late next week. It is understood that as many as 15 components suppliers are refusing to supply Leyland Daf, although the Automotive Products case is the most critical. Automotive Products, a subsidiary of the BBA group, is refusing to deliver more brake and clutch components until it is paid more than Pounds 758,000 that it says it is owed for parts supplied before Leyland Daf went into receivership in February. It would take Leyland Daf months to establish an alternative supplier. Counsel for the receivers argued in the High Court that Automotive Products was in breach of European Community trading law by abusing its dominant position as a supplier and holding the company to ransom. Sir Donald Nicholls, the vice-chancellor, ruled that 'it was not seriously arguable' that Automotive Products' conduct infringed EC law. He said it would be improper to express any view on the criticism of Automotive Products' conduct. The receivers are expected to take the case to the Court of Appeal early next week. It is understood that Leyland Daf owed unsecured trade creditors about Pounds 82m when it collapsed into receivership. Mr John White, BBA group managing director, said yesterday that the company was continuing to negotiate with the receivers. 'We are still very happy to supply if either we get paid or if we get our goods back.' Mr White said that BBA had a 'retention to title' clause in its supply contract with Leyland Daf. He added: 'I advised the receiver that I cannot continue to supply unless I receive substantial monies due to me, or the receiver recognises my right to recovery of the goods.' Iveco Ford Truck, which narrowly lost the leadership of the UK truck market to Leyland Daf in 1991 and 1992, announced that three of Leyland Daf's leading dealers were joining the Iveco Ford franchise. Mr Alan Fox, Iveco Ford managing director, said heads of agreement had been signed with a further three dealers and negotiations were at an advanced stage with five more.</p>

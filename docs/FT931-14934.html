			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Observer: World Bank roundabout With 37-year-old Larry Summers almost certain to be confirmed as David Mulford's successor as the US Treasury's international point man, the World Bank is likely to be hunting for a chief economist. Since the job involves serving both as a personal economic adviser to Lewis Preston, the bank's president, and running a big research department, it calls for an unusual economist - somebody with administrative skills as well as a 'world class' academic reputation. Traditionally, the job has been done by an American, but if Preston wants a respected development economist with strong free-market credentials, he could do worse than pick Jagdish Bhagwati of Columbia University. Being an Indian, he might be a more effective third world ambassador. If the bank decides (as it did with Larry Summers) that an academic reputation is more important than development experience per se, then the field would widen considerably. The bank could consider such respected non-American macro-economists as Willem Buiter of Yale or Olivier Blanchard of MIT. However, the likelihood is that the job will go to another American. Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard, who has made a reputation as a roving adviser to the third world and former communist countries, is one name mentioned. But having recently publicly attacked the IMF for inaction in Russia, he might be seen as insufficiently discreet. But perhaps a more imaginative choice might be Harvard's Martin Feldstein - the director of the National Bureau of Economic Research and a former CEA chairman under Reagan.</p>

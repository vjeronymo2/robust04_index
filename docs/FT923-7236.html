			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / UK Company News: 11.5% growth at Micro Focus SHARES IN Micro Focus, the computer software company, yesterday rose 90p to Pounds 15.43, boosted by reassuring first half results showing an 11.5 per cent lift in pre-tax profit. The shares, which are also quoted on Nasdaq in the US, had been at a 12 month low of Pounds 14.53 after being as high as Pounds 23.78. Mr Paul O'Grady, chairman, said he believed that US investors had assumed the results would be below or at the bottom end of analysts' predictions, following a series of poor results from US software houses. In the event, the interim figures were at the top end and maintained the company's reputation for strong growth despite a tough market. The company was now reporting its results primarily in dollars, arguing that currency fluctuations reduce increases in revenues, earnings and cash deposits when stated in sterling. Pre-tax profits were up from Dollars 15.4m to Dollars 17.2m (Pounds 8.9m), earned on revenues 25 per cent higher at Dollars 54.4m (Dollars 43.6m). Net income per share was 80 cents (70 cents). In keeping with US software house practice the company did not propose a dividend and Mr O'Grady said it was not considering changing. The company specialises in software products which make it easier for other companies to write programs. Mr O'Grady said direct sales grew by 30 per cent, while sales to manufacturers such as IBM, Siemens Nixdorf and Groupe Bull for resale showed slight growth. Micro Focus expected to be able to exploit a move among users of open or industry standard systems through a product which makes it easier to write Cobol business language programs for the Unix operating system. Although market conditions were tough, he expected the company to maintain growth of profits and revenues in the second half of the year.</p>

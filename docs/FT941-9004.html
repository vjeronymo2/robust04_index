			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / PLO and Jordan agree on open border policy Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organisation yesterday agreed an open border policy and wrapped up other details of future economic co-operation in a new spirit of co-ordination following months of animosity over progress in the Middle East peace talks. After two days in Amman, delegates completed talks on issues relating to bilateral trade, infrastructure, and business ventures, all of designed to enhance Jordan's role in the West Bank following establishment of a Palestinian self-governing authority. Foremost was a pledge to adopt an open borders policy for trade across the Jordan River. This comes one month after a banking agreement was signed giving Jordan a central role in developing the West Bank's financial sector with the re-opening of Jordanian banks expected soon. Mr Mohammad Nashashibi, chairman of the PLO's department of economic affairs said this would create an effective economic union between Jordan and the Palestinians. But he expects fierce resistance from Israel at the next round of economic talks in Paris next week. Israel and the PLO have not yet agreed on trade regulations for the new Palestinian entity. Israel is demanding restrictions on entry of Jordanian goods should be continued to avoid them finding their way on to the Israeli market at prices which undercut their own. Israel has suggested a customs union with the Palestinians which Jordan and the PLO say they will oppose.</p>

			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> REMEMBER WHEN;  </P> <P> MR. LUCKY;  </P> <P> JACK LOHRKE, WHOSE BASEBALL CAREER INCLUDED A TOUR WITH THE OLD PADRES, HAS HAD  A WAY OF BEING IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT A TERRIBLE TIME  </P> <P> They call him Lucky, and never in the history of baseball has a nickname been  more appropriate.  </P> <P> Jack Lohrke, who played for the minor league Padres and then spent seven  seasons in the majors, insists today that the series of near misses he went  through was no big deal.  </P> <P> But the facts say otherwise.  </P> <P> Consider this log of Lohrke's good fortune:  </P> <P> In 1944, as a member of the 35th Infantry Division during World War II, Lohrke  participated in the Normandy invasion and the Battle of the Bulge. On four  occasions, soldiers on both sides of him were killed, yet he never got a  scratch.  </P> <P> In 1945, he was scheduled to fly from Fort Dix, N.J., to Los Angeles to be  discharged Nov. 6, but was bumped from the flight -- "for some big shot," as he  put it -- just before takeoff. The plane crashed 45 minutes later, and everyone  aboard was killed.  </P> <P> Then the topper:  </P> <P> In 1946 -- on June 24 -- Lohrke was on a bus trip with the Spokane Indians of  the old Western International League, en route from Spokane to Bremerton, Wash.  </P> <P> Lohrke was hitting .345 as the Indians' third baseman, and when the bus made a  restaurant stop in Ellensburg, Wash., he received a message to report  immediately to the Padres, who had recalled him to the Pacific Coast League.  </P> <P> Shortly afterward, the bus careened off a cliff in the Cascade Mountains, and  nine of the 15 players aboard were killed.  </P> <P> From that time on, it was Lucky Lohrke, and that's the way he is still  remembered by baseball fans of two generations ago. Besides fitting the  circumstances to a T, the moniker is perfectly alliterative.  </P> <P> Still, Lohrke, now 65, won't admit to being impressed by his run of luck. He  lives in San Jose and is retired from his job at the Lockheed Missile and Space  Co. in Sunnyvale.  </P> <P> "I've never been unlucky, that's all," he said. "When I got married, that was  pure luck. My wife, Marie, and I have been married 41 years now, and we have  six children ranging in age from 26 to 40."  </P> <P> Lohrke even sees a positive side to his demotion to the Hollywood Stars of the  PCL after five seasons with the Giants, then in New York, and two with the  Philadelphia Phillies. In January, 1954, he was traded by the Phillies to the  Pittsburgh Pirates, who cut him before the season opened.  </P> <P> "I might have been sent to Wilkes-Barre," he said. "There's nothing wrong with  Wilkes-Barre, but it's not California."  </P> <P> Actually, being assigned to Hollywood by the Pirates meant that Lohrke was  going home. He was born in Los Angeles and attended South Gate High School.  </P> <P> You might think that a player named Lucky would have been given uniform No. 7  somewhere along the way, but Lohrke said, "I never wore 7. I wore 17 with the  Giants, but that was as close as I got."  </P> <P> Beyond the fact that Lohrke was accustomed to being lucky, he says his war  experience had conditioned him to the Spokane disaster.  </P> <P> "At that age, having been in combat, what's going to shock you?" he asked. "I'm  a fatalist. I believe the old song, that whatever will be will be."  </P> <P> This is not to say that Lohrke was unshaken by what happened to nine of his  teammates in the crash. Among the dead were his roommates, second baseman Fred  Martinez and outfielder Bob James.  </P> <P> "When the bus took off from Ellensburg, I bummed a ride back to Spokane,"  Lohrke said. "When I got there, I found out both of my roommates had been  killed. Martinez was from the San Diego area, and a week later, I met his  widow. That was something else.  </P> <P> "I stayed in Spokane a day or so, and then I took Vic Picetti's widow back to  San Francisco. It was very sad.  </P> <P> "After that, I went to Los Angeles and stayed overnight with my mom and dad.  When I arrived in San Diego, Bill Starr (the Padres' owner) chewed me out for  being a couple of days late. He asked me, 'Where have you been?' I said, 'I've  been delivering widows.' He said, 'Oh, I'm sorry,' and I got right into the  lineup."  </P> <P> Lohrke recalled that the first thing he did when he learned of the accident was  to let his parents know he was all right.  </P> <P> "I went right to the telegraph office in Spokane," he said. "I remember the  words to this day: 'Safe and sound. Back in Spokane. Love, Jack.' They didn't  know what I was wiring them about until they read the morning paper."  </P> <P> Two other members of Spokane's 18-man squad missed the fatal bus ride. Pitchers  Milt Cadinha and Joe Faria made the trip by car.  </P> <P> Considering the severity of the accident, it was miraculous that six players  and the driver survived. It was raining at the time, and when the bus veered to  avoid an oncoming car, it skidded through a guard rail and caught fire. It came  to rest 350 feet below, a total wreck.  </P> <P> Lohrke noted that Martinez and Picetti, the latter a first baseman, were  outstanding major league prospects.  </P> <P> "They were natural hitters," Lohrke said. "Picetti was only 19 years old."  </P> <P> The list of victims also included the Indians' playing manager, catcher Mel  Cole. Glenn Wright, a longtime major league shortstop, had preceded Cole, and  his firing early in the season has to rank with the most fortuitous of all  time. He lived to be 83 before dying in 1984.  </P> <P> Two members of the team had played in the majors earlier in their careers.  Catcher Chris Hartje, who had been with the then Brooklyn Dodgers in 1939, died  of injuries two days after the crash. Infielder Ben Geraghty, who had been with  the Dodgers in 1936 and the Boston Braves in 1943 and 1944, was seriously hurt  but recovered. He died in 1963.  </P> <P> "The ones who lived got thrown out through windows," Lohrke said. "They were  all injured, some pretty badly."  </P> <P> With the Padres, Lohrke quickly became a favorite of fans at old Lane Field,  located at the foot of Broadway between Pacific Highway and a parking lot that  is now part of Harbor Drive. Switched to shortstop because 38-year-old Dick  Gyselman was still going strong at third, Lohrke hit .303 in 92 games and  earned a promotion to the majors at season's end.  </P> <P> "When I joined the Padres, Gyselman was one of the first guys I talked to,"  Lohrke said. "He had been up with the Braves long before that (in 1933 and  1934). He said to me, 'I don't know where you're playing, son, but I'm playing  third base.'  </P> <P> "Jack Calvey had been the shortstop, but Pepper Martin, who was our manager,  put me out there, and I got off to a good start. Martin was from the old  school. He just wanted you to hustle."  </P> <P> Of playing at Lane Field, Lohrke said, "If you could hit there, you could hit  anyplace. They had bathtub lights in that park. The only thing you were sure of  was that you were going to play. Compared to the lights in L.A. (at old Wrigley  Field), you would have thought you were in another league."  </P> <P> Lohrke had joined the Padres out of high school in 1942 but played in only  seven games before being sent to Twin Falls of the Pioneer League, where he hit  .271. After three years in the Army, he was ready for the majors, and the route  he took to get there was a story in itself.  </P> <P> Starr, who had bought the Padres in 1945 after a playing career that included  stints as a catcher with them and the Washington Senators, knew he had to make  a deal, because if he didn't, Lohrke would be taken in the major league draft.  He thought he had traded Lohrke to the Braves for four players and $50,000 but  wound up losing him to the Giants for $10,000.  </P> <P> "It was one of the saddest experiences of my baseball career," said Starr, who  still lives in San Diego. "There was no doubt in my mind that the deal would go  through. When it didn't, I was criticized in the press for letting Lohrke get  drafted, but I had to take the consequences."  </P> <P> Under terms of the projected trade with the Braves, outfielder Johnny Barrett  was to report to the Padres immediately, and a pitcher, shortstop and  outfielder were to follow as soon as they cleared waivers.  </P> <P> Barrett became a Padre on schedule, but none of the others, whom Starr declined  to identify, ever did.  </P> <P> Basically, the deal fell through because the Braves didn't obtain waivers on  the three unnamed players before the draft. With Lohrke thus remaining on the  Padres' roster and becoming vulnerable to the draft, he was snapped up by the  Giants.  </P> <P> "When the Giants took him, I was devastated," Starr said. "We would have gotten  three very important players, plus some very important money, and the Braves  had said they guaranteed delivery. I think they could have gotten waivers in  time, or if they couldn't, that they could have adjusted the deal somehow.  </P> <P> "It was the only time in all my baseball experience that anybody in baseball  reneged on me."  </P> <P> Lohrke discussed his confusion about all this.  </P> <P> "I got a notice from the Braves to report to spring training in Bradenton,  Fla.," he said. "Then, whoops, it's the Giants. I had to look up what league  they were in. Is that dumb, or what? I didn't know the difference."  </P> <P> As it turned out, Lohrke never made it big in the majors. He hit only .240 and  .250 with the Giants in 1947 and 1948, spent part of 1949 at Jersey City on  option, and after being recalled, played out his big league career in a utility  role. His lifetime average was .242, with a high of .267 in 1949.  </P> <P> But Lohrke did experience the thrill of playing in a World Series,  pinch-hitting twice for the Giants in 1951. He popped out and struck out.  </P> <P> After his return to the PCL in 1954, Lohrke stayed with Hollywood for two  seasons, then played two with Seattle and one with Portland before retiring in  1958.  </P> <P> "I felt like I could have had a better career than I did," Lohrke said. "I was  playing third base every day with the Giants until they got Hank Thompson and  Monte Irvin in '49. That's when Leo Durocher made me a utility man, and that  hurt me. My hands were tied from then on."  </P> <P> Still, Lohrke cherishes many a memory from his playing days, not only as a  major leaguer but as a Padre.  </P> <P> "When I joined the Padres, I was in awe of everything," he said. "We'd take  trains and spend a week here and a week there. It was great. I thought I was in  the big leagues.  </P> <P> "When I did get to the big leagues, I was really in awe. I'd only played a  couple of years of ball, and I didn't own a suit or a sport coat. There was a  knock on my door, and a little short guy with glasses was there. He said, 'Glad  to meet you. I'm Mel Ott, the manager.' I was flabbergasted. He hit over 500  home runs (511), and he's in the Hall of Fame.  </P> <P> "He took me in to see Carl Hubbell (another Hall of Famer) to negotiate my  contract, and we had a big meeting with dinner. Now guys have agents  negotiating for millions, and they haven't got a base hit yet."  </P> <P> Lohrke hit a career-high 11 home runs as a Giant rookie in 1947, and two of  them were memorable.  </P> <P> "I hit the Giants' 182nd home run of the season, which tied the (Yankees')  record," he said. "Then I hit the 183rd, which broke it. We went on to set a  record of 221."  </P> <P> Lohrke was still with the Giants when a future Hall of Famer named Willie Mays  joined them in 1951.  </P> <P> "He started out 0 for 16, but you could see he was a hell of a ballplayer,"  Lohrke said. "He could have played shortstop, anything. He could have even been  a pitcher, with his natural ability. His hands were twice as big as mine."  </P> <P> As for Spokane, there are times when Lohrke goes back to renew sad memories.  </P> <P> "Every once in a while, they call me for Spokane Indian Day," he said. "The old  ballplayers come, and we talk about the guys who didn't make it and how  fortunate we are."  </P> <P> Especially Lucky Lohrke.  </P></p>

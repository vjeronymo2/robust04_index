			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ROBERTS HELPS GET PADRES UP TO SPEED;  </P> <P> HIS PRESENCE ON BASES IS CAUSING EXCITEMENT -- AND RUNS  </P> <P> It had been a couple of days since Mothers Day, but the topic was mothers.  </P> <P> "Now, I know most mothers can't run very fast," Bip Roberts was saying  Wednesday afternoon in the dugout of Montreal's Olympic Stadium. "But this one,  well, she looked pretty big and mean. And she looked like she could move. I  didn't want to take any chances."  </P> <P> Roberts was talking about a day, maybe 15 years ago, on an Oakland playground.  Roberts had been taunted by a bigger boy.  </P> <P> Acting as he normally would under the circumstances, Roberts listened for a  second, then walloped the kid. The kid started to cry. A big car then pulled  up, and out rolled the kid's mother.  </P> <P> "And here she comes after me, takes off like I don't know what," Roberts  recalls. "And there I go."  </P> <P> And it was at precisely that instant that Roberts came to a realization similar  to one reached many years earlier by another tiny athlete, last name of Pan.  </P> <P> Bip Roberts realized he could fly.  </P> <P> "I turned around, and she was gone," he said, although she wasn't gone, he was  gone. "I realized, I had run so far so fast, the park was out of sight. And I  thought to myself, hey, I can do this."  </P> <P> After seven professional seasons, he is now sharing this insight with the rest  of the National League.  </P> <P> Yeah, Bip Roberts can do that. He can run. He can run faster than any of his  Padre teammates and perhaps as fast as anyone in the league.  </P> <P> He can turn a dull game into an exciting one. Thus far, he has done that in six  weeks worth of season. Into an otherwise mediocre 1989 beginning for the  Padres, Roberts has come bursting out like, well, like a guy whose running  style matches his nickname. What it lacks in definition, it makes up for in  quickness.  </P> <P> Roberts, a 5-foot-7 infielder-outfielder who made the team this spring as a  utility man and a surprise, has since been cast in the role of designated  terror. In the Padres' first 42 games, Roberts was used as a pinch runner 10  times. Three of those times, he stole a base. Three other times, he scored a  run, twice moving from first or second base to score on simple hits that would  score no others on this team.  </P> <P> The five times Padre Manager Jack McKeon has allowed Roberts to start -- twice  at second, twice in right field, once in left -- he has also responded with  speed. He has three triples, second on the club and already one more than he  had in all of 1986.  </P> <P> "He's the fastest man on the team, and you are seeing what speed can do," said  Tony Gwynn, who led the league in stolen bases with 17 in the team's first 42  games.  </P> <P> "Bip is our spark," said Greg Riddoch, the first base coach. "You can see it in  his eyes when he runs down to first base to pinch run. He always wants to take  off. You can tell he's tickled to death to be be here."  </P> <P> It wasn't always that way. When Roberts was prematurely made the starting  second baseman in 1986 following the abrupt departure of Alan Wiggins in 1985,  his life became one of misery and worry. Although he hit a decent .253 that  year, teammates found him cocky and unwilling to change bad habits, and he soon  found himself on the bench. He spent all of 1987 and all but the last couple of  weeks of 1988 in triple-A Las Vegas, lost behind Roberto Alomar.  </P> <P> It seemed his future with the Padres was finished until this spring, when  Roberts showed he can also play third base and the outfield. He also gave  McKeon this idea that, heck, why not keep this fast guy around to replace Jack  Clark or Carmelo Martinez if they reach base in the late innings? If speed is  his best weapon, why not use just that?  </P> <P> "We could see right away his value on this team," McKeon said. "A guy like  that, so you don't play him every day, when you do play him, things happen."  </P> <P> Take Monday in Montreal, where the Padres entered having lost five of their  past six games and then found themselves trailing, 4-3, in the ninth. After  pinch hitter Tim Flannery hit a one-out single off Expo reliever Tim Burke,  Roberts came on to run.  </P> <P> Marvell Wynne then hit a soft single, but Roberts didn't stop running until he  had reached third. From there he was able to score the tying run on Tony  Gwynn's single to shallow center field, which might not have scored him from  second.  </P> <P> But it wasn't enough for Roberts just to tie the game. Two innings later, he  drew a one-out walk on four consecutive pitches from Andy McGaffigan, later  apologizing for it.  </P> <P> "Some guys on other teams say I'm so small, it's hard to find my strike zone,"  he said.  </P> <P> Four pitches later, Wynne doubled to right, and Roberts scored all the way from  first with the go-ahead run. He didn't even need to slide.  </P> <P> "I asked Amos Otis (hitting coach), 'Did the outfielder bobble it, why did I  get in so easily?' " Roberts recalled. "He just looked at me like, 'You don't  know?' It was a nice feeling.  </P> <P> "I guess I don't know how fast I am. You don't feel those things. Maybe you  hear a little wind rushing through your helmet, but you don't feel being fast.  You just run like anybody else runs."  </P> <P> Roberts has obviously not been like any other Padre this year, even when he  stops. He seems to be having more fun. He is often one of the first ones at the  park, one of the first to sit on the bench and watch the opponents take batting  practice and certainly one of the only ones to openly dance to pre-game music.  </P> <P> "You bet I'm having fun," Roberts said. "You spend a couple of years thinking  you're out of baseball, you'd have fun too."  </P> <P> Even if, to this day, people still mishandle his nickname, given to him by an  uncle in memory of a cartoon character.  </P> <P> McKeon still calls Leon Roberts "Biff." A New York newspaper recently referred  to him as "Dip."  </P> <P> And then there was his little weekend first-base visit with the Mets' Keith  Hernandez.  </P> <P> "He turns to me and says, 'How are you doing, Biff?' " Roberts remembered. "I  turned to him and said, 'Fine, Keef.' "  </P> <P> Quick, this kid.  </P> <P> Padre Notes  </P> <P> Joey Cora, the Padres' 1987 Opening Day second base prospect who had recently  fallen on hard times, fell a little further when he suffered ligament damage in  his right ankle May 14 while rounding second base for triple-A Las Vegas in a  game in Vancouver. He will have surgery and probably will miss 6-8 weeks. At  the time, Cora was hitting .294 and leading the Stars with 12 stolen bases. . .  . Another former Padre starter, pitcher Eric Nolte, struggled for Las Vegas in  his first two outings after recovering from an ulcer that required surgery  during spring training. In his first start he allowed four runs in 4 1/3  innings, and in his second he allowed six runs in 4 2/3 innings. . . .  Outfielder Thomas Howard, a top outfield prospect who went backward last season  and finished at double-A Wichita after starting at Las Vegas, finally seems to  be putting it together for Las Vegas this season. In early May, the  switch-hitter reeled off a nine-game hitting streak to improve his average to  .340, with 11 doubles and 11 stolen bases in 37 games. . . . Earlier this year,  the Padres may have had a first in organization history -- two teammates whose  brothers were also teammates in a different organization. Reliever Dave Leiper  and outfielder Jerald Clark each had brothers playing for double-A London,  Canada, in the Detroit Tiger organization. Philip Clark is a top catching  prospect, and Tim Leiper is an outfielder who was recently recalled to triple-A  Toledo. . . . All the stink about the Padre middle relievers should start  easing up, considering their performance in the nine games played thus far on  the trip. The middle men -- Leiper, Mark Grant and Greg Harris -- have allowed  just three runs in eight appearances covering 23 1/3 innings.  </P></p>

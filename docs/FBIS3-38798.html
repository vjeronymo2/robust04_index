The protocol was signed by  Culture Minister Fikri Saglar and Enest Drakovic, Bosnian  minister of education, science, and culture.    Saglar and Drakovic have also issued a joint communique  appealing to the world to end the continuing massacre of the  Bosnian people and the destruction of the Bosnian cultural  heritage. The communique strongly condemns the international  community's indifference against the massacre in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Stressing the necessity of implementing all  the UN Security Council resolutions on Bosnia-Herzegovina, the  communique asks that the unjust arms embargo be lifted  immediately. The communique further calls for an end to the  bombing of the civilian population, the declaration of an  overall cease-fire, and for NATO to undertake every possible  military action to prevent Serbian aggression. The communique,  which is signed by the two ministers, will be sent to  international organizations including the United Nations and the  Council of Europe.    Drakovic also met with National Defense Minister Nevzat  Ayaz.  Ayaz said that Turkey is supporting Bosnia-Herzegovina at  international platforms and that it will also help solve the  problems encountered in the field of education. Drakovic  thanked Turkey for the close interest it has shown and the aid  it has extended so far.</p>

			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Europa Minerals returns to black A strong gold price, increased production and reduced costs helped Europa Minerals, the mining group, return to profit in the six months to July 31. Pre-tax profits for the first half were Pounds 652,000 against a loss of Pounds 313,000 last time; after tax and minorities there was an attributable profit of Pounds 86,000, against a loss of Pounds 575,000. Turnover was up 8.6 per cent at Pounds 9.7m. Earnings per share were 0.3p (losses of 4.3p). Details of the proposed three-way merger between Europa, Burmine and Austmin are being finalised and should be posted to shareholders at the end of the month. Meanwhile, Mount Edon Gold Mines has announced a conditional cash offer for Burmine. This will be considered when a formal offer is made, but at this stage Europa - which has a 38.5 per cent stake in Burmine - intends to proceed with the planned merger.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] On Tuesday, President Yeltsin set out to the Amur  Region and to Tuva (Russia's constituent republic in  southeastern Siberia). On the eve of his departure, he was  interviewed by Interfax corespondent Boris Grishchenko.    Speaking about the goals of his trip, Yeltsin said that both  of these far-away regions were "historically ill-fated", because  despite their enormous riches they still remained economically  and socially backward. The numerous state programs drafted in  the Soviet time failed to bring about the expected results, he  said.    Yeltsin also noted that he did not intend to propose any  programs. "I will take decisions on the spot," he said. "It's  clear, however," he went on to say, "that this region is badly  underfinanced. It is rich in gold, coal, oil and other mineral  resources which can benefit the people. I hope, therefore, that  my visit will help encourage foreign companies--Chinese,  Japanese and Korean (the Republic of Korea - Interfax) to  invest in the local economy."    He also announced that on Monday evening, he held lengthy  telephone talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton. The two  presidents will urge the U.N. Security Council to hold an  international conference on the North Korean nuclear problem and  on international sanctions against that country. "This is an  extremely serious issue," said Yeltsin.    The Russian president's press service circulated a press  release on Tuesday which says that the U.N. Security Council is  drafting a resolution on the North Korean nuclear problem.  "Possible sanctions and the idea of holding an international  conference on the comprehensive solution of the problems facing  the Korean Peninsula must be equally reflected in this  document," says the press release.    To quote Yeltsin, on Wednesday or Thursday, Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev and U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher will meet in Brussels to discuss the North Korean  nuclear problem.    Yeltsin also said that he had accepted Clinton's invitation  to visit the U.S. next September. While in the U.S. he is also  planning to deliver a policy speech during the U.N General  Assembly. "This is likely to happen on September 25," he said.    Speaking about the possibility of signing an agreement on  partnership with the EC during the meeting of the European Union  leaders in the island of Corfu, Yeltsin said: "I was told the  agreement had been almost drafted. This is no good. I will go,  when I'm told that the agreement is completely prepared."    According to Interfax sources, a group preparing Yeltsin's  visit to Corfu, led by Chief of the Foreign Ministry's Protocol  Department, has arrived in Corfu. A team of Russian experts is  to fly out to Corfu soon.    Informed Moscow sources believe that during his trip to  Siberia and the Far East Yeltsin will give his go-ahead to the  construction of Russia's Far Eastern cosmodrome in the city of  Svobodny-18 (the Amur Region). Yeltsin is expected to visit  this city during his stay in Blagoveshchensk.    A spokesman for the Russian Military Space Forces told  Interfax that a feasibility study was being carried out on  commission from the Russian government. IF Note: Previously,  Svobodny-18 accommodated a strategic missile division. The work  to rebuild this facility and adjust it to small boosters Rokot  and space modules for them has got underway.    Commander of the Russian Military Space Forces Vladimir  Ivanov stated that the first rocket would be launched in 1996  from one of the five silos saved after the disbandment of the  division in accordance with the treaty on the limitation of  strategic offensive weapons.    In the future, Svobodny-18 will accommodate a new launching  complex for heavy boosters Angara-24. Compared to the Proton  boosters currently in use, the Angara-24 boosters will have  higher ecological standards and be able to carry heavier  payloads.</p>

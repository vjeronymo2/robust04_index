			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Maastricht in the Balance: Industrialists say vote ignores market realities EUROPEAN industrialists, stunned by the unexpected outcome of the Danish referendum, were anxiously seeking yesterday to assess the wider implications for their companies' operations and the future business climate in the Community. The most dire predictions came, not surprisingly, from Denmark, where Lego, the toy manufacturer, said the referendum outcome had prompted it to postpone a DKr300m (Pounds 26.6m) investment in a new factory and education centre in Jutland. Lego said it feared Denmark would soon have no influence on EC policies, notably in the field of harmonisation. Similar concerns were expressed by Mr Anders Knutsen, managing director of Bang &amp; Olufsen, the hi-fi and television manufacturer. 'Our future growth must take place in markets such as France, Germany, Spain and Italy. If Denmark finds itself having no influence on EC decisions and this has consequences for B&amp;O, we shall have to look at the situation,' he said. Elsewhere, the interest was more in the consequences for the progress of EC integration. In France, Mr Francois Perigot, chairman of the Patronat, the national employers' association, warned that every day lost on the path to monetary union was 'negative for the prosperity, the competitiveness and the development of our companies'. However, Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, chief executive of Metallgesellschaft, the large German mining and industrial group, who said big European companies were already acting as if the Maastricht treaty had been implemented, stated: 'This strategy has created a reality in European corporate life which will not be changed by Danish voters.' Sir Michael Angus, president of the Confederation of British Industry, described the vote as 'sad and serious'. Though he did not think the situation irretrievable, it was a 'warning bell' to Brussels. But many other senior executives were literally at a loss for words yesterday. Attempts to elicit their views on the significance of the referendum result met repeatedly with the response: 'It's far too early to tell.' Nonetheless, except in Denmark, few businessmen appeared to fear any immediate fall-out. Suggestions that the result might slow the pace of cross-border business expansion and takeovers were widely dismissed. Mr Hans Eggerstedt, commercial director of Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group, said the rapid achievement of monetary union had become less important since sterling's entry into the EMS had reduced currency instability. Opinions were much more divided, however, on whether a prolonged setback to the Maastricht treaty would weaken the EMS or, on the contrary, encourage EC governments to reinforce the system to reassure financial markets. The other principal focus of European business is on the single market programme, due to take effect at the end of this year. It is widely felt that work on the legislation has advanced so far that the programme is unlikely to be weakened, still less reversed. Nonetheless, some important decisions remain to be taken in Brussels on issues including investment services, capital adequacy and takeover law. Another closely related issue is liberalisation of the energy market, which the UK had hoped to promote strongly during its EC presidency in the second half of the year. Many businessmen now fear - though some of those threatened by fiercer competition may secretly hope - that these issues will now slip to the bottom of the agenda as the EC struggles to get the Maastricht bandwagon back on the road.</p>

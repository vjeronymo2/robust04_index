			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Letter: A suggested cure to the problem of surplus ACT Sir, Howard Davies (Letters, February 23) is right on diagnosis but wrong on the cure. 'Surplus ACT' is indeed an incentive to move costs offshore. Unpalatably, however, an effective cure would increase the tax bill of those companies which are now complaining. Contrary to general perceptions, the ACT system positively encourages companies to invest overseas, up to a point. This is because they reduce their UK tax bill by paying dividends out of the overseas profits and claiming, quite legitimately, that the dividends come from UK profits. Of course, this analysis regards the ACT as a withholding of income tax on the gross dividend, and not as a tax on the company profits, as your leader of February 19 ('Budget for the supply side') states. If the overseas profits go beyond a point - typically around half of group profits - the company will have made this claim to the full and will run into 'surplus ACT'. It will by then be paying only 8 per cent tax on all its UK profits. A well-advised chancellor would stop dividends funded from overseas profits being used to reduce UK tax bills. UK companies would then find they had a marginal corporation tax rate of 33 per cent and would no longer have a tax reason to export their administrative and development functions. This move would increase the tax liabilities of most UK companies investing overseas and put them on to the same footing as overseas companies investing here.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Customs' Seizures as Low as 4 Percent, Claims </F> Study"]    [Text] As little as 4 per cent of the heroin smuggled into  Britain is being seized, according to a survey published today  which challenges the 10 to 30 per cent figure claimed by Customs  and Excise, writes Duncan Campbell.    A report by the Centre for Health Economics at York  University suggests that the cost-effectiveness of drug  enforcement has been deteriorating since 1985. It argues there  is a lack of accountability among enforcement agencies.    In their study, Trends on the Cost Effectiveness of  Enforcement Activity, Professor Alan Maynard and research fellow  Matthew Sutton say the annual publication of the amount of  illicit drugs seized by Customs and police is traditionally  accompanied by concern pressed about the growing problem. The  authors argue there is no basis for claims that drug traffickers  are being successfully tackled.    Customs and Excise have traditionally suggested that they  seize roughly 10 per cent of all drugs imported and possibly as  much as 20 per cent. The survey disagrees: "Based on annual  figures, Customs rarely achieved the 10 per cent rate."    In 1987 and 1988, the study suggests that a more accurate  figure would be 4 per cent. The estimates are possible for  heroin because there are Home Office figures on heroin use but  not for other drugs.    The budget of approximately &pound;335 million in the last  financial year is divided equally between police and Customs.  The level of spending increased by 74 per cent for the police  and 38 per cent for Customs over the period 1979-89 but, says  the study, were not matched by equivalent increases in impact on  the heroin market.    The study adds: "The light grip which the police had on the  domestic heroin market declined after 1985."    The authors suggest that there is an overall picture of  decreasing cost-effectiveness. "The lack of accountability for  the significant increases in public funding enjoyed by drug  enforcement agencies during the 1980s is surprising,  particularly in a period when the dominant political rhetoric  emphasised `value for money.'"

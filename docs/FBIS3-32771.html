			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Francisco Diez Conseco, peace adviser on </F> human rights, by Francisco Vidal in the station's studios; from  the "Newspaper of the Airwaves" newscast -- live]    [Text] [Vidal] The Democratic Constituent Congress [CCD]  this morning approved a draft bill stating that a military court  will try the La Cantuta case. Francisco Diez Canseco, peace  adviser and human rights representative, is with us today to  share his opinion on the legislative body's ruling, which,  according to some experts, interferes with the judicial branch's  duties. Good afternoon, Mr. Diez Canseco.    [Diez Canseco] Good afternoon. We believe that the draft  bill approved this morning by the CCD -- that is, by the  democratic majority -- is unconstitutional because it is  retroactive and thus violates Article 103 of the Constitution.  It also interferes with the independence of the judicial branch  set out precisely in Article 139, Chapter 2 of the Constitution,  which was approved by a majority of this very same legislature.  Therefore, we believe it is absolutely essential that the  president of the Republic himself -- in accordance with Article  108, which grants him such powers -- assess this law. This is a  gross violation of the law and should not be endorsed by the  executive branch. In addition, it seriously damages Peru's  image to the extent that it implies a cover-up in the La Cantuta  case. This case should be thoroughly clarified and those  responsible punished to the full extent of the law. Both the  Peruvian and international public demand it.    An attempt is being made in this case to defend the Armed  Forces, but instead the institution is being seriously harmed.  We who have objectively acknowledged the government's efforts  toward national peace, specifically the Peruvian Armed Forces'  struggle against terrorism and subversion, want to say on this  occasion that this law is totally inappropriate for the very  Armed Forces themselves, aside from the fact that it is  unconstitutional. As we have said on other occasions, we  believe La Cantuta is an isolated case that does not imply an  intentional policy of human rights violations on the part of the  government. In this case, however, the legislative majority has  grossly violated the law. This cannot be ratified by the  government. We hope it will lead to a presidential assessment  of the law.    [Vidal] But Mr. Diez Canseco, considering the close  coordination between the legislative majority and the president,  and supposing that this law will be published tomorrow in the  official newspaper, thereby becoming effective, what will happen  to Peru's relations with the international community?    [Diez Canseco] In my opinion, they will be seriously and  meaningfully deteriorated, adversely affecting not only the  government but the entire Peruvian community. This is  regrettable because the government has made significant efforts  these past years to correct the errors of past governments with  an eye to reintegrating Peru into the economic community, the  international economic community. The Peruvian people have  cooperated a great deal in this effort with stoicism and  patriotism. We cannot, therefore, allow a gross violation of  the law to put at risk a struggle that has cost considerable  efforts.    To this we must add another aspect which, in my opinion, is  very important. We have already received the report and studies  issued by Mr. Watson, U.S. under secretary of State for  Inter-American affairs, during his visit to Peru several weeks  ago. One of the points that they, the U.S. Government, stress  is the need for an independent judicial branch. The  independence of the judicial branch is being violated here. If  President Fujimori does not assess the law, the Supreme Court  has the means to prove its independence; that is, by applying  Article 138 of the Constitution, the Supreme Court can enforce a  constitutional ruling over a legal ruling that violates the  Constitution.    I do not think we have to go to such extremes. I think there  is a middle road, and the president should resolve this by  taking that road.</p>

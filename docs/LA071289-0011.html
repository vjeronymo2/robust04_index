			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRISONS AND DRUG ABUSERS  </P> <P> I would like to applaud The Times for your editorial "Prisons Won't Do It"  (June 28). The editorial brought out the very important point that more prison  cells are not going to stop or slow the increase in the number of inmates. As  The Times correctly pointed out, 75% of the inmates in Los Angeles have been  incarcerated for drug-related crimes.  </P> <P> On June 19, I convened a public hearing on the shortage of drug treatment  services in the county. At the hearing, representatives of law enforcement,  medicine and public health, children's services, and drug treatment programs  gave startling testimony detailing just how far behind the county has fallen in  its ability to provide drug treatment services.  </P> <P> Ironically, at a time when new federal, state and local funding has been  allocated to interdiction and prevention efforts in the "War on Drugs," similar  funding commitments have not been made for drug treatment programs. It is not  enough to "Just Say No." Federal funding for publicly financed drug treatment  "slots" steadily declined between 1981 and 1987. It would take at least $14  million to restore us to the 1981 level of service, which provided treatment  for almost 7,100 drug abusers.  </P> <P> This is unfortunate because addicts not in treatment place great costs on  society, in the form of crime, prosecution and incarceration costs.  Additionally, there are the risks of drug-addicted babies and AIDS transmission  as a result of addicts not in treatment. Clearly, there is a need to invest  resources in treatment services so as to minimize and possibly avoid greater  human and taxpayer costs.  </P> <P> Were access to treatment available on demand, many drug abusers could be helped  to recover. As UCLA researcher Dr. Douglas Anglin pointed out at the June 19  hearing, "There is incontrovertible evidence that drug abuse treatment works."  Further, research studies of court-ordered treatment have clearly demonstrated  the benefits of counseling and rehabilitation, in conjunction with  incarceration, or the threat of incarceration. Unfortunately, there are more  than 1,700 persons waiting to enter county programs which already have a 4- to  6-month waiting list. When their opportunity to enter a program arrives, many  will have lost interest or be unavailable due to incarceration.  </P> <P> On June 27 the board approved my motion to direct the Department of Health  Services to develop a drug treatment demonstration project for convicted drug  offenders. Such a program, in collaboration with the sheriff, district  attorney, Superior Court and Probation Department, would serve as a model, and  more effectively utilize our limited resources by coupling treatment with  conviction, probation, and/or incarceration. The board will consider funding  for this project when it holds budget deliberations beginning on July 19.  </P> <P> EDMUND D. EDELMAN  </P> <P> Chairman  </P> <P> Board of Supervisors  </P></p>

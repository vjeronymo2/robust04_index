			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SPOTLIGHT  </P> <P> It was not the best of seasons for either Jamie Grossman or Pierce College, but  both gained a measure of redemption in last week's 38-35 loss to Bakersfield,  the top-ranked junior college team in the nation.  </P> <P> Behind Grossman, Pierce gave Bakersfield a shock, even if it did not pull off a  shocking upset.  </P> <P> No one else had played undefeated Bakersfield closer than 12 points, but  Grossman put Pierce on top with two early touchdown passes, then twice led the  Brahmas (4-6) back from second-half deficits.  </P> <P> Grossman, a sophomore from Cleveland High, twice completed six passes in a row.  He finished 19 for 31 for 295 yards with three touchdowns and no interceptions.  </P> <P> Jamie Grossman: Pierce  </P> <P> Football: Quarterback  </P> <P> Soph: 6-2, 195 pounds  </P></p>

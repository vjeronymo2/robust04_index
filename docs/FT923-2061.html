			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Europe's currencies face heavy selling pressure MOST OF the remaining currencies in the European exchange rate mechanism came under intense selling pressure yesterday as investors grew anxious that France would vote No in its referendum on the Maastricht treaty tomorrow. For the second day running, the Bank of France intervened heavily on the foreign exchange markets, buying francs for D-Marks, as its currency came within one centime of its floor against the German currency in the ERM. Investors also sold the Danish krone and the Irish punt in exchange for D-Marks. The switch out of the punt pushed up the interest rate at which commercial banks can lend to one another overnight in the Irish money market to 300 per cent. Sterling, which withdrew with the lira from the ERM this week, again came under selling pressure after Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, cast further doubt over an immediate return to the system. However, dealers in the sterling money market priced in an imminent half percentage point cut in UK base rates. The pound lost another 2.75 pfennigs in London yesterday, closing against the German currency at DM2.6125. At this level, it is 12 per cent below its former central ERM rate of DM2.95. In late New York trading it was at DM2.605. Against the dollar it fell more than 4 cents in London to Dollars 1.74 and lost further ground in New York to Dollars 1.735. However, sterling's suspension from the system continued to raise hopes in equity markets that there would be a cut next week in the UK's bank base rates, currently at 10 per cent. The FT-SE 100 index of leading shares closed up 83.1, at 2,567.0, after a 105-point rise on Thursday. The gains took the index, up 196 points this week, to its highest level for three months. Rates in the sterling cash market also priced in a cut in UK base rates. Three-month money, an important indicator of what the market thinks the next move in base rates will be, closed at 9 5/8 per cent on the offered side from 15 per cent the night before. The French franc was supported by several factors apart from the Bank of France's intervention, including the temporary suspension by the French central bank of one of its key lending facilities to commercial banks. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank deputy president, helped the French currency by saying: 'The franc is in no way at risk. The franc is a very strong currency which has achieved inherent stability.' The franc closed in London at FFr3.4230 to the D-Mark, 0.75 centimes above its ERM floor against the German currency, and in late New York trading was quoted at FFr3.4210. In Belgium the central bank governor, Mr Alfons Verplaetse, said the Belgian franc would move to a slightly wider divergence against the D-Mark.

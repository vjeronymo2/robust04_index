			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] President Guntis Ulmanis speaking in Riga said the  signing of a package deal with Moscow on Russian troop  withdrawals was largely hinged on a solution to the problem of  repatriation of retired servicemen of Russia and the former  Soviet Union residing in Latvia.    To bring this about, the negotiating teams will have to  amend  the initialled agreement on social security nets for retired  Russian servicemen with permanent residence in Latvia, Ulmanis  said. Ulmanis also considers it necessary to create an  international support fund by Latvia, Russia and western  countries to help towards voluntary repatriation of Russian  servicemen (The Latvian government on Thursday had approved  Ulmanis' proposal to set up an appropriate working group-IF).  Nothing short of this can help defuse tension over the issue of  retired servicemen whose presence here is widely seen as being  undesirable, Ulmanis said.    He thinks the fund can also help repatriate 180,000  non-Latvians who are willing to settle in Russia and other CIS  states. The signing of the pullout agreement will be  complicated unless the repatriation issue is resolved, Ulmanis  said.    IF Note: The initialled agreement binds Latvia to ensure  continued residence and non-discrimination of retired Russian  servicemen in areas such social security and medical care.  Official counts put the number of such pensioners at 22,000  with 3,500 of them granted Latvian citizenship.    Ulmanis reiterated that no agreement would be signed with  Moscow until the Russian president recalled his decree of April  5 providing for the setting up of a Russian army base in Latvia.  He considers it to be a tactical move to probe a possible  reaction from Latvia and the West rather than a mistake as  Russian officials try to present the decree.</p>

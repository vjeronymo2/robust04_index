			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Travel: Island-hopping through the South Seas - John Westbrooke watches coconuts grow on the Cook Islands, meets friendly Fijians and studies serious rugby-playing Samoans IS THERE no such word as 'Pacificism'? Maybe we should invent it, to describe the hold the South Seas have on our imaginations. 'Orientalism,' after all, is the way we construct a myth of the east. But the Pacific islands play as big a part in our dreams of paradise. Just think of Gauguin, Robert Louis Stevenson, grass skirts, blue lagoons. We need a word for all this Pacific dreaming. Tahiti is probably the place most people think of as an island nirvana (except Americans, who think of Hawaii). Moorea and Bora Bora fit every requirement: cloud-capped peaks, steep green slopes tumbling to golden sands, coral reefs with white waves outside and calm pale blue water within. The natives are friendly francophones - this is French Polynesia, baguettes and yellow headlights. They beguiled poor Captain Bligh's men into mutinying so that The Bounty could stay a while longer. Their happy promiscuity had long been suppressed by missionaries by the time Gauguin was drawn there, which is probably just as well, otherwise Papeete would be the Bangkok of the South Pacific. But while women no longer swim out naked to greet sailing ships, new arrivals at the airport will be welcomed with leis and ukulele music. Sometimes it is hard to look on all this natural beauty without wondering whether tourists do it any good, and hearing in your mind's ear Big Yellow Taxi, Joni Mitchell's lament for Hawaii: 'You don't know what you've got till it's gone, They paved paradise and put up a parking lot.' A common feature of the beach hotels, for instance, is bungalows built ostentatiously over shallow water and containing glass coffee tables through which you can watch and even feed vivid tropical fish from the comfort of your living room. At one such hotel we saw sand being pumped in from the next bay to improve the beach. Ecologically sound, we were assured; but it does not seem right. By way of an awful ecological warning, there are the Bali Hyatt Ruins on Bora Bora, half-built on a hill when the rains washed the land away and the money ran out. The Tahitians know their Joni Mitchell, and promise that their island will not go the way of Hawaii. Bora Bora will not go the way of Tahiti. Huahine will not go the way of Bora Bora. I hope they are right. And Hyatt (which denies any connection with the ruins) merits some sort of sensitivity prize for its Regency Hotel, which clings so modestly to a hillside outside Papeete you can hardly see it. FOR an equally Pacific and much less touristy experience, fly a few hundred miles west to the Cook Islands. In this easy-going backwater people speak English, drive on the left and wave to strangers; and the towns look like rural New Zealand. The best hotel in the islands, the Rarotongan Resort, is nobody's idea of luxury, but it has beaches and island nights where the vigorous local music and dancing are on display. And again, you are in blue lagoon country. A day trip to Aitutaki, one of the neighbouring atolls, must rank high among the world's best: barbecues under the palms, snorkeling over the coral, white sand between your toes. There is a prosaic explanation for the palm-fringed beaches: coconuts wash ashore, and seeds sprout at the high-water mark. Knowing this does not make them any less idyllic. Though the islands were named after James Cook, the first Europeans to see them were Spanish, in 1595. A Spanish Polynesia never developed, but the notion is a pleasing one: corridas in which matadors throw leis round the bulls' necks, perhaps, and a redoubled respect for manana. These days the Cook Islands' main connection is with New Zealand, in a Monegasque arrangement whereby the islands are self-governing but Wellington provides defence and a lot of aid. ANOTHER short flight takes you on to the islands of Western Samoa, which is a different sort of place. You can see it at once on the airport road, in the vivid gardens, covered in black rocks, rootling pigs and the occasional family grave; in the 100 churches in 20 miles; and in the way most people don't live in houses. Instead they have a fale - a floor and a palm-frond roof, separated only by poles. If it is too hot or cold or wet or windy, blinds are let down, but there are no walls and only basic furniture. Stevenson lived, died and is buried on a hill outside Apia. Somerset Maugham (who set Rain in nearby American Samoa) would be at home in the sunny, slightly seedy capital, too: you might find him observing the crowd in a bar, while Paul Theroux sits next to him muttering into his beer. He would be staying at Aggie Grey's, a burger bar which grew into one of the great colonial hotels and has recently been brightly refurbished. Western Samoa feels unwestern. People are friendly enough, but Theroux is not the only foreigner to have found a sort of teasing hostility in small villages. The country was the first Pacific island to achieve independence, in 1962, after decades of often oppressive rule by Germany and New Zealand; and Samoans are proud of it. But independence comes at a price. Agriculture and fishing provide little money. The banana trade was brought to its knees by bad weather and erratic shipping, and mostly lost to central America. Tourism is one of the biggest businesses, though it is not very big. The locals might look content but many are unemployed, and remittances from those who leave home are a big source of income. Samoans are their own people, but they hold a special place in the western imagination, too, thanks to Margaret Mead's Coming of Age in Samoa (drawn from American Samoa), suggesting that, for Samoans, growing up could be free of trauma and sex free of guilt. Her findings have been hotly disputed and certainly aren't true now, but they are a prime example of Pacificism, the attributing of a better life to a far-off place. IN FIJI, you are back with the tourists. Not so long ago Fiji was the dark side of the Pacific myth. Lots of south sea islanders ate people, but the Fijians seem to have pursued their cuisine with unusual gusto; startled visitors had their buttocks fondled as they arrived, to check for fat content. Bligh passed through these waters, hastily and without landing, the locals hot on his heels. But the missionaries were as successful here as anywhere else. Fijians are now devout Christians, and the singing of a church choir will weaken your knees. Violence is not unknown - we watched a village rugby match end after 10 minutes, with a man carried off and the opposing team facing suspension for the season - but tourists are no longer in danger. If they do not come it may be for another reason: politics. In 1987, the army overthrew the elected government and set out to limit the influence of Indians, originally brought in by Europeans to work the cane fields but now almost outnumbering the natives. Fiji isn't South Africa, and the races seem to co-exist, but the tensions between them are an unwelcome reminder that, even in paradise, some angels may be more equal than others. Liberal travellers are used to seeing locals worse off than themselves (if you want a wealthy Pacific island try Nauru, the Saudi Arabia of guano), but the sight of inequality being imposed, and the thought of the military doing it, may make some of them prefer to holiday elsewhere. They would be missing something if they did. Hard up against the date line, Fiji claims to be the first country in the world. The sun pours down. The people are friendly, without fondling your buttocks. The palm trees are forbidden to grow lower than the hotels. The reefs teem with lurid fish. The blue lagoons. . . well, both Blue Lagoons, the Jean Simmons one and the Brooke Shields re-make, were filmed around Yasawa, a string of islands at the west end. We stayed at the Yasawa Island Lodge in big, bright bungalows amid vegetation so lush it was hard to believe it had been devastated by a cyclone only last January. (The cyclone-free southern winter is the time to visit). At the east end of Fiji, famous for its glottal stops, we stopped at Matagi island, which specialises in diving; you can spend the days among some of the world's richest coral walls and the evenings chatting about tables and bommies, or swim under waterfalls on neighbouring Taveuni and look out at night for the cane toads. You can fly between islands - atolls look particularly beautiful from the air - or take a cruise, or stay at a hotel and luxuriate. And whenever you leave, the locals will sing Isa Lei, the haunting Fijian song of farewell. John Westbrooke travelled as a guest of Air New Zealand.

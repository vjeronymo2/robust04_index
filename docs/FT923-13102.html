			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Warning over tourist industry POORLY paid and badly trained hotel employees, together with inadequate public transport, threaten the UK's position as the world's fifth most popular tourist destination, according to a study by the National Economic Development Council. The NEDC study, published yesterday, says the UK has held its own in the international tourist industry over the past 20 years. Its share of tourists was 4.2 per cent of the world total in 1990, the same as in 1970. Its share of world tourist spending has remained about 6 per cent for 20 years, suggesting Britain has been attracting visitors who spend more than the average. The study says, however, that this success masks worrying trends. Skill levels in UK hotels are lower than in continental Europe. British hotels also employ more staff than their continental counterparts but pay them less. The report says both the private and public sectors should raise the quality of tourist facilities. The private sector should also improve training and productivity, which would make the tourist industry more attractive to job entrants. The UK has attracted increasing numbers of visitors from the US and Japan, but has been less successful in northern European markets. The NEDC, which is due to be abolished at the end of the year, says that UK tourism should not try to compete on price. 'Comparison of the UK with other destinations shows that overall it is not particularly expensive; London falls into the middle range of leading European cities.' The report urges the tourist industry to create a new representative body to stress the sector's importance. Tourist spending, including domestic tourism, accounts for nearly 4 per cent of GDP and employs 1.6m people - more than the health service. Surveys carried out for the NEDC list British culture and heritage, the arts and London as attractions mentioned most often by visitors to the UK. Only the US, Spain, France and Italy attract more tourists. UK Tourism: Competing for Growth. Nedo Books, Millbank Tower, London SW1P 4QX. Pounds 11.20.</p>

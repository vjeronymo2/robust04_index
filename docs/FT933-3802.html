			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Reuters strong International news and information organisation Reuters Holdings advanced 24 to 1554p, buoyed by news about its Globex trading system. The after hours electronic dealing mechanism was developed by Reuters and is owned by the main Chicago trading exchanges, the CBOT and CME. It suffered after the London International Financial Futures Exchange said it would not join forces with the CBOT and CME because of a clash over its lucrative German government bond future contract. Yesterday, it was announced that the talks were back on track. The morning after the night before at Babcock International found investors slightly more forgiving of Thursday's profits warning and the shares slipped back just 1 3/4 to 29 3/4 p. Turnover was another huge 29m, demonstrating good two-way business in the engineering group. Analysts attending a meeting with the management yesterday said that a rights issue was a near certainty to mend the balance sheet, with talk of a Pounds 50m 1-for-3 needed by the year-end. Electricity and water utility stocks surged as investors bought on yield considerations. Smith New Court was said to be recommending the water stocks, although the house refused to comment. All the waters saw hefty rises, among them Severn Trent up 13 at 556p, South West 15 to 580p and Yorkshire 16 to 565p. Among the Recs, East Midlands gained 11 to 530p, Manweb 10 to 592p and Yorkshire 8 to 574p. Mining company RTZ fell 12 to 713p on a downgrade from a London brokerage house, adverse press comment and lower copper prices. Swiss Bank moved to a sell from buy based on a bearish outlook on the dollar and copper prices. There was also press comment that RTZ would find it difficult to match its interim 15 per cent profits rise in the second half. Finally, dealers said copper's early weakness, falling more than Dollars 23 to a low of Dollars 1,877, was another factor. Uncertainty over the outlook for base metal prices as the global economies struggle to recover from economic recession has restrained share prices in the sector. Container leasing group Tiphook jumped 14 to 268p after revealing its first ever breakdown of container use. Telecoms groups rebounded after the mauling earlier this week after the launch of Mercury's new cellular network, One-2-One. Sector analysts were busy advising clients on the likely developments in the industry following Mercury's sudden expansion into what is seen as a highly-prized market. There was also talk that BT was closer to buying the 40 per cent stake in Cellnet owned by Securicor as a result of Mercury's move, although analysts said they believed such a development was not imminent. Estimates put Securicor's stake at around Pounds 1.5bn. BT shares gained 3 to 419 1/2 p, while Securicor ordinary climbed 8 to 1073p. Buying from across the Atlantic again helped Vodafone, ahead 4 at 493p. An unimpressive meeting following the announcement of the results as well as the disclosure of further losses saw Ratners shares lose 2 to 32 1/2 p. The company also received approval to change its name to Signet with immediate effect. August figures from BAA showed an increase in passengers handled of 4.6 per cent on the same period last year. The news helped the shares edge forward 2 to 820p. A recommendation from Kleinwort Benson was said to have aided the rise of Ocean Group, up 2 at 337p.</p>

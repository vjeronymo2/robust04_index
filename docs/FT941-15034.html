			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Unions expect tough pay round: Companies are stiffening their resolve As the first shots in Japan's spring wage offensive were delivered last week, the country's labour unions braced themselves for what are expected to be stiff negotiations in the next few months. Mr Takeshi Nagano, chairman of the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations (Nikkeiren) said yesterday little could be expected in the way of wage increases. 'I am worried about whether this spring's labour negotiations can result in wage increases, or whether we will even be able to support the labour force (at current levels),' Mr Nagano told a group of businessmen. The season will be particularly challenging for the Japanese Electrical, Electronic and Information Union, which represents the country's electronics and software industries. As the union covering one of Japan's leading industries, and as one of the largest unions in Rengo, Japan's Trade Union Confederation, the JEIU's success or failure will be crucial in determining the outcome of talks for other unions. But the difficulty faced by Japan's electronics industry in the face of the yen's rapid rise and the slump in domestic consumption has meant it will take more than the usual negotiating skills to wrest favourable terms from company managements. The union, which represents 298 company unions and has a membership of nearly 870,000, is seeking wage rises of 5 per cent, in line with the 5-6 per cent increase being put forward by Rengo. The 5 per cent rise is a level which the JEIU sees as crucial in raising real wages, stimulating consumption and leading the country out of its economic woes. According to a JEIU survey of member households, real wages fell last year, while spending rose as a result of higher social security costs. As a result, the unions also consider an income tax cut essential for economic recovery and are highly critical of the Finance Ministry's position that an income tax cut can only be made if there is a rise in the consumption tax. 'It is against international common sense to increase taxes at a difficult time like this,' says Mr Yukuo Ajima, bureau director of the JEIU. The unions' position is being challenged on various fronts, not least by the Nikkeiren. The JEIU faces a particularly tough stand from employers, some of whom have suggested that annual wage rises that are part of the employment contract may have to be sacrificed this year. 'The electronics industry has been damaged (in the recession), and we expect (the talks) to be very tough,' complains Mr Ajima. In a bid to bolster the unions' prospects, Rengo members have discussed the possibility of changing the order for when wage settlements are made for each industrial sector. Such order is crucial, since early settlements set the tone for deals made for the rest of Japan's labour unions. If high settlements can be agreed by the first in line, it is easier to convince management at other industries to follow the lead with good offers. Traditionally, the JEIU, together with the three other unions representing Japan's leading industries of car, steel and shipbuilding, have been the first to reach annual spring wage settlements, an arrangement that suited the unions while times were good. But since none of these industries are faring well in Japan's downturn, union leaders are concerned that they might set a negative tone to overall talks. Nevertheless, there are no other candidates for the job, and the JEIU's Mr Ajima is expecting tough talks ahead in the union's role as standard-bearer. This year, the difference between the position put forward by the unions and that maintained by the employers federation is even greater than last year, when Rengo sought a 7 per cent wage hike. Few people expect to see tensions rise to dangerous levels over the wage issue. Japanese labour-management relations have not led to active union protests for at least the past 10 years. Nevertheless, Mr Ajima is not ruling out the possibility of strikes just yet.</p>

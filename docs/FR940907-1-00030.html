Progress payments made by the Contractor to its subcontractors shall be the unliquidated progress payments paid to subcontractors that are mentioned in (b)(1) and (b)(2), if the following conditions are met:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The amounts included are limited to the unliquidated remainder of progress payments made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The subcontract or interdivisional order is expected to involve a minimum of approximately six months between the beginning of work and the first delivery, or, if the subcontractor is a small business concern, four months.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The terms of the subcontract or interdivisional order concerning progress payments_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Are substantially similar to the terms of this provision or to the clause at FAR 52.232&hyph;16, Progress Payments, for any subcontractor that is a large business concern, or that clause with its Alternate I for any subcontractor that is a small business concern;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Are at least as favorable to the Government as the terms of this requirement;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Are not more favorable to the subcontractor or division than the terms of this requirement are to the Contractor;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Are substantially in conformance with the requirements of paragraph 32.504(e) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Subordinate all subcontractor rights concerning property to which the Government has title under the subcontract to the Government's right to require delivery of the property to the Government if (A) the Contractor defaults or (B) the subcontractor becomes bankrupt or insolvent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The progress payment rate in the subcontract is the customary rate used by the Contracting Agency, depending on whether the subcontractor is or is not a small business concern.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The parties agree concerning any proceeds received by the Government for property to which title has vested in the Government or against which a lien has been placed in favor of the Government under the subcontract terms, that the proceeds shall be applied to reducing any unliquidated progress payments by the Government to the Contractor under this contract.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) If no unliquidated progress payments to the Contractor remain, but there are unliquidated progress payments that the Contractor has made to any subcontractor, the Contractor shall be subrogated to all the rights the Government obtained through the terms required by this requirement to be in any subcontract, as if all such rights had been assigned and transferred to the Contractor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) To facilitate small business participation in subcontracting under this contract, the Contractor agrees to provide progress payments to small business concerns, in conformity with the standards for customary progress payments stated in subpart 32.5 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Contractor further agrees that the need for such progress payments shall not be considered as a handicap or adverse factor in the award of subcontracts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Retentions <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Upon preliminary acceptance of each vessel and upon the submission of properly certified invoices, the Government will pay to the Contractor the amount withheld under paragraph (b) of this requirement in respect of that vessel in excess of (i) a performance reserve in the amount of one and one-half percent (1.5%) of the allocated total contract price for such vessel, or (ii) one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), whichever is greater. If at any time it shall appear to the Government that the amount of performance reserve may be insufficient to meet the cost to the Government of finishing any unfinished work under the contract for which the Contractor is responsible, or of correcting defects for which the Contractor is responsible which are discovered prior to preliminary acceptance or during the guaranty period of any vessel, the Government may, in making payments under this requirement, deduct or withhold such additional amounts as it may determine to be necessary to render such reserve adequate;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> provided <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> , that any additional amounts deducted or withheld on account of defects which are discovered during the guaranty period of the vessel shall not exceed the limit of the Contractor's liability as set forth in the requirement entitled ``LIMITATION OF CONTRACTOR'S LIABILITY FOR CORRECTION OF DEFECTS'', reduced by the amounts of the cost incurred by the Contractor for work on such vessel because of Contractor responsible deficiencies which are discovered during the guaranty period of the vessel. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Guardian Royal All credit to Guardian Royal Exchange for grasping the nettle of new European accounting rules by including investment gains in profit. The old format, under which only investment income flows through the profit and loss, makes an arbitrary distinction between yield and capital gain. If the accounting change focuses attention on how insurance companies invest shareholders' funds, so much the better. Yesterday's figures demonstrate that investment performance often matters more than underwriting. GRE's net assets have risen by more than half over the last year despite net underwriting losses. There is room to doubt the company's claim that such returns are the result of deliberate strategy. The Pounds 40m gain from Irish gilts, for example, looks fortunate. Whether such returns justify the degree of investment risk is an open question. Until insurers improve the quality of disclosure on their distribution of investments it will remain so. One might also wonder whether large investment gains are compatible with underwriting profits other than in the short term. Having restored insurance profits by shedding business, GRE would doubtless relish the opportunity to take the initiative. With a solvency ratio of 55 per cent, the best in the sector, it can afford to do so. Yet GRE's record of picking the right route for expansion is less than comforting. That amounts to an argument for caution even if that means returning surplus capital to shareholders, however enticing the investment returns might seem.</p>

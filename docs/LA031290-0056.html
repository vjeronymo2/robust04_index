			<p><P> March 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UC SANTA BARBARA'S PIMM IS LEFT ROOTING FOR NEVADA LAS VEGAS  </P> <P> Jerry Pimm watched the Big West Conference tournament final on television  Sunday afternoon, knowing that his UC Santa Barbara team would make the NCAA  tournament only if Nevada Las Vegas held off Cal State Long Beach.  </P> <P> At halftime, Long Beach trailed UNLV by two points and found out it needed to  win to make the NCAA tournament.  </P> <P> "It was a grind," Pimm said. "You couldn't make a basket or draw up a special  play. It was gut-wrenching, sitting there and watching and rooting for UNLV  hard, knowing that one team was already a No. 1 seed and playing for pride and  the championship, and the other guy was not going to get to go. That was tough,  and it was tough on our conference."  </P> <P> Santa Barbara (20-8) lost to Pacific in the conference tournament  quarterfinals. It plays plays Houston (25-7) Thursday at Knoxville.

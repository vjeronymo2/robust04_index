			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee bounces back as roasters return The Coffee market returned to the offensive yesterday with London prices shooting up and traders predicting more gains as supplies remain tight. Coffee prices recovered much of Wednesday's losses with the September futures contract at the London Commodity Exchange up Dollars 44 a tonne to Dollars 2,080 a tonne. Traders said that much of the speculative and hedge fund selling which had pushed prices down on Wednesday was absent from the market and that roasters were buying again. 'We are not seeing much new coffee come on to the market, the speculators have taken their profits and prices look ready to move up again,' one trader commented. However, Mr Rubens Barbosa, Brazil's ambassador to Britain said yesterday that producers would be damaged if prices went up much more. The cocoa market rose higher on the coat tails of coffee with the September futures contract increasing by Pounds 10 a tonne to Pounds 1,041 a tonne.</p>

			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO;  </P> <P> BOARD GETS VIEWS ON SUPERINTENDENT  </P> <P> The Capistrano Unified School District's next superintendent should be an  academic with strong communication skills, according to residents who addressed  the Board of Education this week.  </P> <P> "In selecting candidates you should consider academic leaders and not just  business managers -- a Ph.D. in English or languages, perhaps," the board was  told by Marilyn Sullivan of the local chapter of the American Assn. of  University Women.  </P> <P> "Interpersonal relationships are most important. We suggest someone who can  bring honor and respect for the administration among teachers and the support  staff."  </P> <P> Thirteen residents attended a hearing Monday at which the board sought public  comment on qualities that should be possessed by the successor to Jerome  Thornsley, who is retiring June 30 after 16 years as superintendent.  </P> <P> The board, however, wavered on its announced goal of hiring a replacement by  Jan. 25. Because of delays in advertising the position in education magazines  and newspapers, board member E.G. (Ted) Kopp said, the board would have to rush  to meet that deadline. He suggested moving the date to Feb. 25, but the board  delayed a decision.  </P> <P> The board did decide to hold similar public hearings at 7 p.m. Monday and 6:30  p.m. Dec. 17, before its regularly scheduled meetings.  </P> <P> The board also invited residents to call Ira Krinsky, the consultant who is  conducting the district's search for candidates, at (818) 568-3311 to express  their views or to write to Krinsky in care of the district.  </P> <P> At Monday's meeting, Nancy Fee, president of the Capistrano Bay chapter of the  League of Women Voters, agreed with Sullivan, adding that the new  superintendent should be able to relate to the growing minority community.  </P> <P> "This is not the same district (as) 10 years ago," she said.

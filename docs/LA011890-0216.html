			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DEAL ON HOTELS SEEN AS PROGRESS IN SOVIET TRAVEL  </P> <P> When the fall semester ended last month, Cal State Fullerton professor Robert  S. Feldman boarded a flight for Leningrad so hastily that he had to grade final  examinations as he crossed the Atlantic.  </P> <P> Feldman, director of the university's Russian and East European Area Studies  program, said the quick exit was worth the trouble. He sealed a deal for his  small Placentia travel company that he said makes him the first American to  deal directly for rooms at hotels in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Under the arrangement, Feldman said, he will book the tour groups he leads to  the Soviet Union directly into the Leningrad Hotel or the Yalta Hotel, instead  of having to make arrangements through Intourist, the national tourist office.  </P> <P> Feldman's deal is significant because he believes it marks the first time a  small U.S. travel company has signed a contract for reservations with major  Soviet hotels.  </P> <P> And he said it will allow him, as a small tour operator, to deal directly for  hotel space that might normally be unavailable, except to large outfits.  </P> <P> "I couldn't get (hotel rooms) through Intourist unless I was a great big tour  operator," he said. "Space is at a premium in Soviet hotels, especially in the  summer."  </P> <P> In addition, Feldman said, booking directly with the hotels and getting to know  their staff members should mean better service for his groups.  </P> <P> As part of the deal, Feldman will arrange tours of the United States for staff  members of the two Soviet hotels. A key part of the tours will be visits to  hotel management schools so the Soviet visitors can see how U.S. hotels are  run.  </P> <P> Feldman is president of East-West International Tours Inc., a private tour  company not affiliated with the university.  </P> <P> The Russian-speaking Feldman said he was introduced to the tour business in  1978 after a neighbor who knew of his expertise in Soviet studies urged him to  lead a sightseeing and cultural trip to the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Much to his surprise, Feldman said, he enjoyed shepherding a pack of tourists  through major Soviet cities and some of the nation's far-flung republics. But  for the next few years, campus responsibilities kept him from developing a  business.  </P> <P> When campus duties lightened, Feldman said, he started his agency in 1984. He  has led about a dozen tour groups so far. During those visits he has developed  business relationships with Soviet hotel officials that blossomed with the  coming of perestroika, Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program of economic  reform.  </P> <P> Business has expanded so much that Feldman said he will take a leave of absence  from the university for a year to work on a book of readings about Gorbachev  and his policies and to expand his tour business.  </P> <P> As for his end of the deal, Feldman said, he is planning to lead Leningrad  Hotel staff members in September for a tour of New York, Washington and the  hotel school at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y.  </P> <P> While details are being worked out, he also hopes a group from the Yalta Hotel  can tour Los Angeles, Santa Barbara and stop off at the hotel school at the  University of Nevada-Las Vegas in November.  </P></p>

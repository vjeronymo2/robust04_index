			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> JAIL FOR RICH MAN, POOR MAN, ASTRONAUT, PILOT, THIEF  </P> <P> A judge refused to reduce bail for a man charged with larceny and defrauding  his wife and her family by impersonating an astronaut and using their credit  cards without permission.  </P> <P> Robert Hunt, 27, of suburban Medford was held on $100,000 surety or $10,000  cash bail.  </P> <P> His attorney, James Cipoletta, asked District Court Judge Frederick Doyle on  Wednesday to reduce the bail to $1,000 cash but the district attorney told the  judge he did not think Hunt would remain in the area if released on bail.  </P> <P> "He (Hunt) is becoming increasingly disappointed," Cipoletta said. "He feels  he's being unfairly accused of being a con man."  </P> <P> Hunt was arrested after State Trooper Andrew Palombo began a private  investigation into the case. Palombo heard about Hunt from a Saugus family who  allegedly paid him $2,000 to get their son out of the Navy.  </P> <P> "He had convinced an 18-year-old to enlist in the Navy, then he told the  parents he could get the boy out of it for $2,000," Palombo said.  </P> <P> The family allegedly gave Hunt a $2,000 check, which he said was no good and  demanded cash, which they gave him. He then cashed the check as well, Palombo  said.  </P> <P> During the investigation, Palombo said he discovered Hunt had impersonated an  array of people. During the last eight years he married at least four times and  allegedly posed as a space shuttle astronaut, a baby powder manufacturer, a  professional baseball player, a successful contractor, a Marine captain and jet  pilot.  </P> <P> Officials say he was none of those things.  </P> <P> His wife of five months, Ann Sweeney, had believed him. However, she filed for  divorce Wednesday.  </P> <P> Hunt's astronaut impersonation, complete with a NASA space suit and helmet, won  the praise of the Lord Mayor of Dublin, who made Hunt an honorary citizen of  Ireland during a visit.  </P> <P> Hunt also dressed in full Marine colors and gave one of his wives a tour of the  U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., where he claimed to have graduated first  in his class.  </P> <P> On a flight to Montreal, Hunt was invited into the cockpit where he explained  to the pilot how he landed the space shuttle Atlantis, Palombo said.  </P> <P> After arresting Hunt, Palombo said he asked him one question on the way to the  police station in Boston.  </P> <P> "I asked him a question and he launched into a 15-minute soliloquy about  corporate takeovers," Palombo said. "Finally I said, 'Cut the bull and admit  you're not an astronaut.' "  </P> <P> Hunt paused and said, "There's no law against pretending to be an astronaut."  </P></p>

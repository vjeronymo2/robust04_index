			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Books: Immigrant returns AFRICAN LAUGHTER: FOUR VISITS TOZIMBABWE by Doris Lessing HarperCollins Pounds 16.99, 442 pages IN African Laughter Doris Lessing goes home - to Zimbabwe, as Rhodesia became in 1980. She had not been allowed back for a quarter of a century because she was a 'PI' - a Prohibited Immigrant to her own country] - but with 'Independence' this nonsense fell aside and in this book she describes the four visits she has made since then. To anyone with the faintest interest in, or knowledge of, Southern Africa, it is an engrossing and fascinating record. It is a long book of artful simplicity. On each trip she arrives, travels, describes, analyses and, sometimes, judges. She loves her country, of course, and the most moving sequences are those in which she returns, first in reminiscence and conversation, and at last apprehensively in person, to the childhood farm of The Grass is Singing. 'We lived in Eden and didn't know it', she and her brother agree. Today there is no shortage of serpents in Zimbabwe, and one recurrent theme is her need to balance her instinctive (almost patriotic) optimism for Zimbabwe with her honest admission that so much is going wrong; in particular, she does not fudge the issue of corruption among the new ruling class. We start in 1982 with a country still recovering from a savage inter-racial war: the people are 'sick'. By 1988 - the longest section  - the war is a fading memory as she roams the country, meeting everyone. In this visit we glimpse a country coming to terms with corruption, the falling-short of the original utopian expectations. By 1992, briefly, we are beyond corruption, and stupid economic policies, and land hunger, and unemployment, and even AIDS (which may kill one million out of nine million before the 2000) - 'Southern Africa is drying up, that's the news. That is the only news.' Are the rains going to come in November? And will Mrs Lessing, after this wise and candid book, be a PI for the second time?</p>

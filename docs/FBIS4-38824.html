			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Solntsev] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 2 TASS -- Korean President Kim Yong-sam  said on Thursday he is quite convinced that "a very bright  future lies ahead of us" in Russo-Korean relations.    Speaking at a dinner hosted by President Yeltsin, Kim  Yong-sam noted that "we will surely share a great future  together if the advanced technology and vast natural resources  of the Russian Federation are combined with the industrial  development and business management expertise of Korea."    Kim Yong-sam expressed confidence that "great friendship and  trust" shared by the two presidents, despite their relatively  brief association, will "serve as a strong catalyst for further  developing relations between our two nations."    The president said he hopes that "the Russian Federation  will  actively participate in the Asia-Pacific economic cooperation  forum."    According to him, documents concerning the Korean war of  1950- 1953 which were handed today to the Korean president by  Boris Yeltsin "will stand as a symbol of our firm determination  to make a fresh start in our relations, putting behind us our  unfortunate past relations during the era of Cold War."    Kim Yong-sam expressed gratitude to the Government of the  Russian Federation for "its positive participation in the  international movement to block the development of nuclear arms  by North Korea."</p>

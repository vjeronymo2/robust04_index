			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Observer: The spunk of Munk Royal Oak Mines of Vancouver, which bid for Toronto-based mining group Lac Minerals earlier this month, was presumably disappointed when the big guns of American Barrick rolled in with a rival offer at the beginning of the week. But perhaps Royal Oak's executives should extract a glimmer of comfort from Barrick chairman Peter Munk's rather formidable schedule in coming days. On Monday, the Hungarian-Canadian entrepreneur went straight from briefing analysts and journalists on his Lac intentions to his first lunch and board meeting as chairman of Trizec, North America's biggest publicly-traded property developer. Horsham, another Munk-controlled enterprise, has become Trizec's main shareholder after investing more than Dollars 500m to keep the developer afloat. Today sees him in St Louis for the board meeting of another Horsham subsidiary which is edging towards the purchase of a Texas oil refinery. All this follows a special American Barrick directors meeting 10 days ago at which Munk and his colleagues decided to press ahead with a feasibility study for a Dollars 170m gold mine in Peru. July normally sees Munk cooling his heels on his private island in a bay off Lake Huron. But it is perhaps no coincidence that this burst of activity comes at the height of summer. One visitor to the island retreat was taken aback to find a relatively modest cottage - lacking a dishwasher. Putting together blockbuster business deals surely beats drying dishes.</p>

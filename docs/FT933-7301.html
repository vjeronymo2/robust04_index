			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Tokyo ready to act on trade surplus JAPAN'S new ruling coalition, grateful to Washington for intervening in currency markets last week to hold back the rise in the yen, is signalling that it has moved the issue of the country's trade surplus with the west higher up its political agenda. Mr Hiroshi Kumagai, minister for international trade and industry in the seven-party government, said yesterday that a continuing high trade surplus would be 'one factor leading to the destruction of the world economy'. A group of visiting US congressmen headed by Mr Sam Gibbons, chairman of the House ways and means subcommittee on trade, at the weekend pronounced itself satisfied that the government sworn in two weeks ago was taking the problem seriously. Mr Gibbons, a Florida Democrat, expressed the hope that talks on a new bilateral economic framework, which begin next month, would produce results by January. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, is due to give a policy speech to parliament today covering issues from political reform - his government's main aim - to how to deal with a prolonged slowdown in the domestic economy. The coalition pledged on Thursday to deregulate administrative procedures in order to free up imports. Although aides were playing down expectations of further initiatives in the speech, it will be followed by two days of questions in the Diet (parliament) which may clarify government economic thinking. It comes as some members of the new cabinet, among them Mr Kumagai, are stepping up calls for an interest rate cut and a public spending programme to boost domestic demand. The appreciation of the yen by some 16 per cent against the dollar this year has battered Japanese export competitiveness but has also swollen the bilateral trade surplus in dollar terms. The yen touched a record Y100.40 to the dollar on Thursday before the US Federal Reserve moved in to buy dollars, allowing it to close the week at Y104.50 in New York. The government disavows having struck any deal on the yen and the trade deficit with the administration of President Bill Clinton, to whom Mr Hosokawa spoke by phone only hours before the Fed's intervention.</p>

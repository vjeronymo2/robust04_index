			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets: Singapore equities burst into activity  -Excess liquidity has been driving the market higher recently At last Singapore's brokers have something to get excited about. For much of the past year the equity market has been in the doldrums, overshadowed by the more spirited performances of markets elsewhere in the region, particularly those of Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur. But not any more. Singapore has burst into life, with the local Straits Times Industrials Index rising about 40 per cent since last October. Earlier this week the index hit an all time high of 1,797 - up from around the 1,500 mark at the beginning of the year and 1,300 in the middle of 1992. Since then the index has eased, closing yesterday at 1,783 for a gain of 0.6 per cent on the week. The recent spurt was initially prompted by heady activity in nearby Kuala Lumpur, with Malaysia related stocks accounting for the bulk of transactions. But in the last few days Singapore companies have been leading the charge. Sembawang and Keppel, two of Singapore's biggest shipyards, have been riding high. So have the local banks and companies in the property sector. Good economic fundamentals are partly behind the new found market optimism. Last year the economy grew by 5.8 per cent and official GDP growth projections for this year are conservatively put at between 6 and 7 per cent. Singapore's all-important export sector is also performing exceptionally well. Government figures released this week indicate that first quarter non-oil exports were up 20 per cent on the equivalent period last year. Market sentiment is tending to reflect broader regional trends. For instance, the rally in Hong Kong, due to the resumption of talks with China, has buoyed up the Singapore market. But the main factor behind the rise is an excess of liquidity. Both corporate and personal taxes were cut in a budget earlier this year. The government is actively encouraging wider share ownership, allowing larger portions of the Citizens Provident Fund, a mandatory savings scheme, to be invested in stocks. 'It's the sheer weight of money available in Singapore that is driving the market up,' says Mr Tom Inglis of Peregrine Securities. 'Bank deposit rates are only 1.5 per cent. People can go and buy a house, but they are very expensive. Instead they are putting their money into the market.' Now about 15 per cent of Singaporeans own shares. The government wants to bring that up to around 30 per cent - in part to counter criticisms that the island republic's wealth is not being adequately spread among the population. A number of partial privatisations of big state controlled companies will add much needed depth to the market. There have also been a number of new listings, most of them massively oversubscribed. The floatation of Singapore Telecom (ST), the state owned telecommunications and postal service, likely in August or September, is being billed as the largest public listing yet in the region. Brokers say that the market will probably value ST at SDollars 10bn-SDollars 15bn (Dollars 6.2bn-Dollars 9.4bn). About 25 per cent of ST is likely to be floated, with some 15 per cent available to foreigners. It's estimated that the floatation will add about 15 per cent to total market capitalisation. Brokers say that foreign fund managers are showing renewed interest in Singapore in the run up to this flotation. The government has already said that it plans further sell-offs of state enterprises, including stakes in the Port of Singapore Authority and the electricity and gas divisions of the public utilities board. Some companies are rushing to the market in advance of the ST floatation. Keppel Bank, part of the Keppel conglomerate, is likely to be listed next month and listed companies are tapping the market for more funds. Analysts say that even with the ST floatation and other company listings there is no sign of market liquidity drying up. 'Plenty of money, particularly local, is still going into the market,' says one broker. 'Some shares are overvalued but there's little sign that people are backing off. Right now there might not be many bargains in Singapore but long term it's still one of the best bets in the region.'</p>

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: US buys Wellcome Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome recovered 19 to 747p on the back of a rush of US buying. The overseas interest was prompted by a shift of stance by US investment bank Morgan Stanley. The house pharmaceuticals analyst Mr Duncan Moore said that following presentations in London and New York 'the risk in breaking mid-teens growth rate is less and there is more potential for upside surprise' He said that he had an 18-month share price target of Dollars 15 (970p) to Dollars 18 and felt the shares had been 'horribly oversold'. Finally, there was a bounce as dealers appreciated that worries over a rival drug to Wellcome's azt anti-Aids treatment were overdone.</p>

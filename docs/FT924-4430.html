			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Control Securities extension Control Securities, the brewing, hotels and property group negotiating a financial restructuring with its banks, has won an extension of the standstill agreement on its borrowings until December 18. This allows it to continue trading during the discussions. The standstill is intended to cover the period when the banks' credit committees are coming to decisions over the restructuring. The standstill is likely to be extended again thereafter to allow time for documentation to be finalised. The group has debts of Pounds 259m. Its shares have been suspended at 16 1/2 p since October last year.</p>

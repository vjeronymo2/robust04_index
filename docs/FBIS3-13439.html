Talking to a group of foreign correspondents in Islamabad last  night, she said that as long as India refuses to take  appropriate steps to make the bilateral talks purposeful, we  will continue to raise the issue at the global level. She said  that it is her government that successfully raised the Kashmir  issue at international forums after the 1940's. I first raised  the issue at the Islamic Conference Organization in 1990, and it  was my government again that decided to raise it in Geneva, the  prime minister said. We made the decision because it was a  matter of principle, and it was the only means by which we could  highlight the Kashmir issue at the international level, she  added.    Ms. Benazir Bhutto said that the Kashmir issue was raised in  an unprecedented manner in the past more than three decades.  India had to agree to allow, though unwillingly, the Amnesty  International and other human rights groups to visit occupied  Kashmir. Despite its hesitation, India also had to agree to  allow the ambassadors of Western and Nonaligned countries to  visit Kashmir.    Ms. Benazir Bhutto said that regarding the resolution, India  had promised us through Iran that it would allow the ambassadors  of Islamic countries to visit occupied Kashmir. Fourteen  countries expressed concern over the people of Jammu and Kashmir  and violation of human rights when the voting on the resolution  was deferred. The prime minister said that India is now  reneging on its promises, but we will not let it do that. India  has lost any sympathy of the people of Jammu and Kashmir because  Kashmir never remained a part of India. The future of Jammu and  Kashmir has not yet been decided, and the solution to the issue  is not to send Indian troops there. The solution lies in  granting the self-determination rights to the people of Kashmir,  a goal to which Pakistan is committed.    Referring to Pakistan-U.S. relations, the prime minister  said  that the two countries are holding bilateral talks on ways to  resolve all their issues. She said that some U.S. officials  feel that the Pressler Amendment failed to realize the objective  of nuclear nonproliferation, and we want the American people  understand the implications of the amendment. Pakistan has  displayed patience in this regard, and it should be rewarded for  that.</p>

			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'DECADES' CELEBRATES ENGLISH PHOTO HISTORY  </P> <P> "The Formative Decades: Photography in Great Britain, 1839-1920," at the County  Museum of Art, kicks off a spate of exhibitions celebrating the 150th birthday  of photography.  </P> <P> Before the year is over, every photo show in the country will probably be  billed as a commemorative event, but this one really digs into history.  </P> <P> Containing 130 images from the riches of the Harry Ransom Humanities Research  Center at the University of Texas at Austin, "The Formative Decades" was  actually organized for the university's centennial, but it serves very well as  a toast to the medium. From early images of leaves produced without a camera  and jewel-like daguerreotype portraits in velvet-lined cases to 1919 X-rays of  incubating eggs, the exhibition is a captivating journey through photography's  early, experimental days.  </P> <P> The English penchant for travel -- typified by the Grand Tour -- is reflected  in many images but it also serves as a metaphor for the entire exhibition.  English photographers actually lugged glass plates and cumbersome cameras to  the Egyptian pyramids and took more up-to-date equipment to the Antarctic, as  we see in works by Francis Frith and Herbert George Ponting.  </P> <P> But even when they stayed at home, the photographers in the exhibition often  behaved as intrepid explorers in unknown terrain, trying every facet of the new  medium and every possible application of this democratic art form. Whatever  else they may be, these pictures are a record of a struggle against technical  and material limitations.  </P> <P> Many of the images in the show don't look like art; instead, they reflect a  period when inventive people were trying to figure out what to do with  photography and how to stretch its capabilities.  </P> <P> The results are sometimes bizarre. An example of "spirit photography," for  example, depicts a draped female head emerging from another head. Though  obviously manipulated, this image was collected by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle as  "evidence" of spiritualism. Other pictures occasionally border on the ghoulish:  portraits of a dead baby, a starving Russian girl and a Zulu prince who was  about to expire.  </P> <P> More often, the photographs are elaborately posed theatrical compositions or  relatively straightforward landscapes that tell us a great deal about British  values and life styles.  </P> <P> Among the most telling are "living" tableaux of costumed characters that  provided entertaining morality lessons for Victorian and Edwardian citizens.  Julia Margaret Cameron, represented here by a couple of romantic portraits, was  the premiere artist of the genre. But we also find Henry Peach Robinson going  to enormous trouble to combine negatives and studio setups in "When Day's Work  is Done," a sentimental picture of an elderly couple.  </P> <P> The firm of Hughes and Mullins photographed members of the royal family acting  out "Idylls of the King," while T. A. Rust posed a devil and an angel in a  wacky scene called "The Game of Life." Another curiosity is a hand-colored  stereograph by Alfred Silvester that features peasants beating up on a goose  dressed as Emperor Louis-Napoleon.  </P> <P> Like writers and painters, these Pictorialists were looking for important  themes. Today, most of their pictures appear to be illustration, though it  simulates painting and bears some relationship to current  "fabricated-to-be-photographed" work.  </P> <P> "Straight" photography and street work didn't come into vogue until the  mid-20th Century, but their counterparts and predecessors are here. Peter Henry  Emerson, who advocated a "naturalistic" approach, is represented by a  surprisingly economical image of farmers in a hay field. Horatio Nelson King's  picture of Hampton Court (circa 1880) is strikingly modern in its emphasis on  the structure and shadows of a bridge.  </P> <P> Other photographs of humble workmen, dramatic waterfalls, rock formations and  tropical plants document the growth of photography as an amateur sport.  </P> <P> Some portraits reveal an urge to show people as working members of a community  rather than picture-perfect subjects. Joseph Parkin Mayall's portrait of artist  Valentine Cameron Prinsep in his studio and W. Currey's shot of Prime Minister  William Gladstone resting after chopping wood are certainly not candid, but  they mark an abrupt departure from the properly stiff, staged images that  predominate.  </P> <P> "The Formative Decade" (to March 19) is a show of details, an exhibition that  has us peering closely at tiny images or intricate bits of larger ones and sets  us to questioning the limitations of dozens of techniques. In fact, it's so  intriguing that we hardly notice how weak it is as an art show. This seems to  reflect a conscious curatorial decision, however. The point is to demonstrate  how photography grew up in England and how firmly it was woven into  middle-class life.  </P> <P> One of the least compelling images illustrates this idea with resounding  clarity. It's an unidentified photographer's picture of a house in India. Out  of focus and produced on a broken plate, it was nonetheless preserved in an  English gentleman's album. More than any other image in the show, this one  speaks of photography's ability to create a surrogate experience, to conjure up  a memory that must be preserved.  </P></p>

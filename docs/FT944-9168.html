			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Derivatives (20): Stability lifts hopes in Brazil / Profile of BM&amp;F, Sao Paulo's commodities and futures exchange It was Brazil's soaring inflation and economic volatility that helped give birth to Sao Paulo's commodities and futures exchange (BM&amp;F), today the fifth biggest futures exchange in the world. And although inflation has recently fallen dramatically, following the launch of a new currency linked to Brazil's foreign reserves, the BM&amp;F (Bolsa Mercadorias &amp; de Futuros) has continued to grow as new uncertainties emerge. Created in 1986, the exchange has expanded dramatically in recent years. The number of contracts traded jumped to 60m last year from 45m in 1992, while during the first nine months of this year contract volume reached 64m and financial volume was Dollars 754bn. Market analysts hope that following last month's presidential election of Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who helped introduce the new real currency and is expected to push for structural economic reforms, Brazil is on the path towards long-term economic stabilisation. That process is likely to create sustained economic growth and reverse the short termism which dominates Brazil's financial system, as well as increase the assets of pension funds and unit trusts. These factors are in turn likely to increase demand for derivatives from companies and investment funds. But the BM&amp;F has still to overcome problems, including government restrictions that limit foreign investment and hamper trading links with exchanges abroad. Also, important areas such as agricultural futures generally lack liquidity, which is concentrated in just a few contracts, notably one-day interbank deposit contracts, dollar futures and stock index futures. Another problem is the narrow customer base, which is dominated by Brazil's banks. They generated much of the exchange's growth in their need to hedge one-day interbank deposit contracts, Brazil's benchmark interest rate. 'There are probably only around 200 customers, nearly all financial institutions,' says a Sao Paulo banker, adding that most company treasurers still do not use derivatives because of the short-term outlook prevalent in Brazil, caused by high inflation. Another reason has been that, despite inflationary volatility, other areas of the economy used to be relatively stable. For example, the central bank used to devalue the local currency on a daily basis, in line with inflation expectations; but since the new currency was launched the bank has generally not intervened in the foreign exchange market, and instead has allowed the real to float against the dollar. This has created new uncertainties for companies and a growth in dollar futures trading. Bankers say the small size of Brazil's over-the-counter market, which represents about 10-15 per cent of the BM&amp;F's volume, is an indication of how underdeveloped the use of derivatives by companies is. But if long-term economic stabilisation is achieved, analysts expect the balance sheets of companies and financial institutions to lengthen, which will probably create more demand for hedging. This process has already begun. Since the real was launched in July, futures contract terms have been gradually lengthening. Mr Marcos Eugenio da Silva, a University of Sao Paulo economist, expects the next six months to be a period of adaptation to low inflation. He notes that in the pre-real days, when inflation was 40-50 per cent a month, there was only very short-term liquidity for the key one-day interbank deposit futures. 'Now that there are fewer worries about inflation, some interbank deposit contracts are being negotiated for terms of six months,' he says. As well as encouraging the lengthening of contract terms, the BM&amp;F is trying to develop international links, partly to increase the volume of agricultural futures trading, which currently represents 5 per cent of contracts, and also to take advantage of Brazil's position as one of the world's leading agricultural producers. The exchange would like to attract some of the agricultural futures trading from Chicago to Sao Paulo, particularly for commodities such as coffee, of which Brazil is the world's leading producer. However, the exchange has had limited success in establishing liquidity for agricultural contracts. Part of the problem, according to Mr da Silva, is that production in Brazil of commodities such as orange juice, cotton and sugar cane are concentrated among a few companies, which are often suspicious of the futures market. He adds that establishing international links is hampered by Brazil's lack of a stable and convertible currency. Another problem in creating trading links with foreign exchanges is government restrictions. Government restrictions also limit foreign investment in the BM&amp;F. Only foreign investors who hold shares on Brazilian stock markets can invest in futures. Foreign investment is mainly in stock index and dollar futures, the latter for investors seeking to hedge the value of their portfolios, and represents 7.5 per cent of total investment, according to Mr Lauro de Araujo Silva, BM&amp;F market relations director. Liberalising foreign investment would increase speculation and liquidity, say analysts. They point to the example of Sao Paulo's stock market, where average daily trading volume has increased tenfold to Dollars 400-500m since it was opened to international investors in 1991. 'We are seeking ways for international investors to trade here, in the same way as they do in New York or London,' says Mr Araujo Silva. The BM&amp;F wants the government to liberalise foreign investment in order to prevent development abroad of the market for Brazilian stock futures. The US over-the-counter market already trades futures of the Brazilian stock indices and basket options made up of a handful of blue-chips.</p>

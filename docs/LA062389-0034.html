			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TEST TUBE PROVES FRUITFUL FOR COUPLE  </P> <P> When David and Luz Barragan turned to in vitro fertilization five years into a  childless marriage, they had no idea it would come to this.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, the Guadalajara, Mexico, couple became the proud parents of a set  of healthy quadruplets. Luz Adriana, Citali, Diego and David were born at 9:30  p.m. at UC San Diego Medical Center, according to a hospital spokeswoman. The  newborns' weights ranged from 3 pounds to 3 pounds, 10.5 ounces.  </P> <P> "I am very happy and relieved because there was a lot of risk," David Barragan  said Thursday. "Now the worries are about fatherhood."  </P> <P> But these days, the risks associated with such a pregnancy are minimal, said  Dr. Thomas Moore, director of the center's perinatal division.  </P> <P> The odds of bearing quadruplets, normally 1 in 10,000, increase with the use of  in vitro, or test tube, fertilization, Moore said.  </P></p>

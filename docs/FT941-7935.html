			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: High cost of share options Sir, Whatever views one may hold about share option schemes, one thing should be made clear. They are not costing large amounts of lost tax - quite the opposite. Most directors who exercise high-value share options will sell the shares immediately. So the director who realises a gain of Pounds 1m will be subject to 40 per cent capital gains tax on virtually all the gain, just as he would have paid 40 per cent income tax on a Pounds 1m bonus. The director's gain is the company's loss. The shareholders will lose value of Pounds 1m just as surely as if the company had paid a bonus of the same amount to the director. The vital difference is that the bonus payment earns a corporation tax recovery of Pounds 330,000, making a net cost of Pounds 670,000, whereas the cost deriving from the share option gets no such relief. So share options are a much more expensive way of delivering value to directors than cash bonus schemes. The only reason share option schemes persist is because the cost to shareholders does not appear in the profit and loss account, or indeed anywhere else in the accounts, and it is only through the newspapers that some of the largest figures are revealed. If shareholders really appreciated what share option schemes are costing them, particularly in terms of extra tax, they would close the schemes overnight and replace them with cash bonus schemes.

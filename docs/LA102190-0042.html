			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW YORK RESTAURANTS NEED NOT BE EXPENSIVE  </P> <P> Feeling the impact of a post-market-crash economy, New Yorkers are hunting for  -- and finding -- great places to dine out for less than $15 per person,  according to an industry survey.  </P> <P> "There is no need to eat badly in any price level," said Punch In  International, an electronic information service that surveys the travel, wine  and restaurant industry.  </P> <P> "The good news is that the quality of food has improved -- thanks to a  health-conscious generation and the nouvelle movement."  </P> <P> "An economy turned sour, a generation of out-of-work yuppies and the current  influx of hot money from abroad have brought back the sorrily missed breed of  wonderful ethnic spots, music and jazz haunts and bistros-cum-trattorias,"  Punch In International said.  </P> <P> Italian cuisine is leading the ethnic pack, with the East Side's Belladona  proposing pasta dishes for only $6, with a bring-your-own-bottle policy surely  helping to slash the check.  </P> <P> "It is a charming sidewalk cafe, BYOB policy and $6 pastas that can rival and  even surpass the $20 variety offered by its competitors," the survey said. "A  three-course meal can be devoured for under $15."  </P> <P> Arlecchino Ristorante Italiano, in the Village, is another Italian restaurant  combining genuine atmosphere (though the chef is from Ecuador) and fine  traditional cuisine, realistically priced.  </P> <P> New contenders on the New York ethnic scene are a string of Middle Eastern  restaurants offering a variety of "sensuous, theatrical and appealing" cuisine,  Punch In said.  </P> <P> Also in the Village is Lofti's Couscous, named after the traditional North  African dish made of grain served with lamb, chicken and vegetables in a spicy  sauce, and described as simply "the best Moroccan restaurant to ever open in  New York."  </P> <P> Also getting high marks for good Middle Eastern cuisine combined with low  prices is the East Side's Sido Abu Salim, which rates rave reviews for its  eggplant puree and tabbouleh salad.  </P> <P> When it seemed that nothing new could emerge on the crowded Chinese restaurant  scene, Triple Eight, dubbed a "Chinatown extravaganza," promises to deliver a  spectacular traditional tea-lunch, delivering cart after cart of dumplings and  appetizers for less than $15 per person.  </P> <P> Also from the Far East, and flourishing on the West Side, are numerous Korean  barbecue houses, specializing in thinly sliced beef wrapped in spices and  lettuce leaves. Ny Kom Tang Bul House is a name worth remembering, while its  West 32nd Street rivals also deserve a visit, the survey said.  </P> <P> For true bargain-hunters and spice-lovers, the India Pavillion is the place to  go on East 54th Street, with the check totaling not more than $10 per person.  </P> <P> And for low-calorie, low-budget diners, the Little White House brings Turkish  delights such as grilled fish and meat -- "New York's best buy in a steak  dinner for under $15" -- although it is advisable for weight-watchers to forgo  the extra-sweet deserts.  </P> <P> Good deals at French restaurants are hard to find anywhere in the world --  including Paris. Punch In praised Les Sans-Culottes, on the East Side, with its  distinct wallpaper depicting leading characters of the French Revolution, and  hard-to-pronounce Pierre's Les Douceurs de Paris, in the Village.  </P> <P> Often crowded is midtown's Kennedy's where a traditional Irish meat pie and a  beer cost about $10. A few blocks away is Kavkazian, a Georgian restaurant  which "may have some of the worst service in town," but "the best fried chicken  in town" and great Russian music.  </P> <P> Recommended: Belladona, 307 East 77th St., (212) 535-2866; Arlecchino  Ristorante Italiano, 192 Bleecker St., (212) 475-2355; Lofti's, 28 Cornelia  St., (212) 929-3693; Sido Abu Salim, 81 Lexington Ave., (212) 686-2031; Triple  Eight, 78 E.

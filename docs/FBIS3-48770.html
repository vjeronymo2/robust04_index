The compromise plan calls for replacing the current  multi-seat constituencies for the House of Representatives with  a combination of 300 single-seat constituencies and 200  proportional representation seats to be allotted based on the  popular vote in 11 electoral units, the sources said.    On the equally controversial issue of political  fund-raising,  the two sides agreed to allow individual politicians to  designate one body for gathering political donations from  enterprises and groups, they said.    Despite prospects that the compromise might undermine the  original purpose of stopping rampant political corruption, the  bills are likely to be enacted before the end of current Diet  session on Saturday, the sources said.    Hosokawa's coalition government moved to bridge the gap  between itself and the LDP by agreeing to amend the government's  four-bill reform package, which was voted down by the House of  Councilors last Friday. The package passed the more powerful  lower house last November.    After the joint council of both houses of the Diet  established for the purpose approves the compromise, the  government-proposed bills may be passed Saturday, the final day  of the current Diet session, and then revised in the next  session starting Monday. The council is made up of 10 members  from the coalition who voted for the bills in the lower house  and 10 legislators from the opposition who opposed the package  in the upper house.    Hosokawa and Kono talked at the Diet building for about two  hours Friday evening after Takako Doi, speaker of the lower  house, urged the two rivals to come to terms on the issue.    Ichiro Ozawa, co-leader of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party],  the second-largest but most influential party in the ruling  coalition, also attended the meeting along with LDP Secretary  General Yoshiro Mori.    Doi proposed passing the bills without setting a date for  implementation and then discussing revision of the package in  the next Diet session, the sources said.    The compromise plan ultimately agreed to was revealed to  reporters during a break in the meeting when both Hosokawa and  Kono visited Doi to report about the plan. During the break,  Mori told reporters that the two sides had agreed not to accept  Doi's own proposals for dealing with the problem.</p>

			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Lottery could raise Pounds 10bn for good causes, say bidders The first national lottery in Britain for more than 150 years could raise up to Pounds 10bn for good causes over the next seven years, it was claimed yesterday. Eight groups representing a wide range of businesses, including TV, bookmaking and entertainment, lodged bids to run a lottery that officials said would create many new millionaires. A leading contender for the seven-year licence, Mr Richard Branson, the Virgin chairman, who together with Lord Young, the former cabinet minister, put in a bid by the UK Lottery Foundation, said the lottery could raise up to Pounds 10bn. Two other leading bidders suggested a similar amount might be raised. The government plans to spend a share of the proceeds on public 'good causes' - arts, sports, charities, the national heritage and a millennium fund. Mr Peter Brooke, National Heritage secretary, said the fact that eight bids had been submitted was 'immensely good news for everyone'. The competition would help cut costs to a minimum and 'in the next year or so the first millionaires' from lottery prizes would be enjoying their new-found wealth. Mr Peter Davis, director-general of Britain's first national lottery since 1826, hopes to pick the winning bidder by the end of May. The first tickets could go on sale by early next year. Mr Branson said the UK Lottery Foundation, which unlike the other bidders would give all its profits to good causes, was talking to Marks and Spencer, which, he said, was 'inclined to support' the bid. The retail group will decide next month whether to allow Foundation terminals into their stores in the event of a Branson-Young victory. Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of Camelot, a front-runner, said its submission represented the combined recommendations of the world's leading lottery experts. Sir Christopher Benson, chairman of Games For Good Causes, said the consortium had devised 'an exciting games strategy'. Mr Gerry Robinson, chairman of the Great British Lottery Company, promised 'the amount retained by us will be very small'. Whatever happens to Richard Branson's lottery bid, he won the publicity battle yesterday. Despite snow, Desert Orchid, the racehorse, was called in to promote his bid. Observer, Page 17</p>

			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Nigeria surveys the wreckage: The end of the oil strike has lifted a cloud, but what is revealed are the conditions for continued economic gloom Nigeria's economy is quick to bounce back from adversity, but while business is back to normal after a two-month oil strike, few captains of industry are celebrating and most are bracing themselves for more shocks. The end of the strike has lifted a cloud only to reveal the wreckage. Big manufacturers estimate that they lost the equivalent of six weeks business to the strike, which brought together industrial, ethnic and political grievances in a trial of strength between a military government dominated by northern interests and the economically dominant south. UAC, Nigeria's leading conglomerate, posted half-year results 17 per cent below forecast. 'Economic policies here are going in the opposite direction to the rest of the world. Unless there are changes we are heading for economic calamity,' says Mr Christopher Kolade, chairman of Cadbury Nigeria, a leading food manufacturer. 'Even though people are back at work, business needs to regain a basic level of confidence that the situation is settled,' says Mr Kolade. While the ports and the banks were closed during July and August, manufacturers could not clear goods through the ports and imports had to be unloaded in neighbouring Benin or Ivory Coast The delays and added costs of imports are hitting hard in the depressed consumer industries. Breweries and soft drinks manufacturers estimate that sales are still 25 per cent below levels in June and are relying on a good pre-Christmas season. Structural problems of the past four years - high government deficits, reliance on oil for nearly all foreign currency and industry's dependence on imported supplies - are compounded by harmful economic policies and an unstable political outlook. Nine months after the military government re-introduced state controls on the private sector, industry faces a period of low demand, low investment and high inflation. Nigeria's economic policies have brought the censure of the World Bank and indifference from bilateral creditors, but no prospect of badly needed aid or debt relief. General Sani Abacha's regime overcame the recent challenge by opponents of military rule not by persuasion but through a show of force, leaving deep dissent and ethnic divisions. He has won Round One in the struggle to stay in power but few analysts doubt that Round Two is coming. If the regime is dismissive of political opposition, it seems deaf to criticisms of its economic policies. After regulations fixing foreign exchange rates in the January budget, the formal private sector pinned its hopes on a policy reversal; when a mid-year budget review produced no changes and the political crisis brought the economy nearly to a standstill, business leaders wrote off 1994 as a bad year. Among the big companies, the fittest will survive but, outside the oil sector, the political and economic risks in Nigeria offer more incentives to short-term traders and speculators than to long-term investment. 'What we wanted to see from the budget review was firstly a more liberal foreign exchange and interest rate policy,' says Mr Bassey Ndiokho, chairman of UAC Nigeria. 'Fixing exchange and interest rates without any control over the demand was unwise.' Electricity supply is unreliable so companies uses diesel generators. During the oil strike fuel costs went up between 300 per cent and 500 per cent. The outlook for the oil industry is better but the government's failure to pay its 60 per cent share of the industry's costs has led to under-investment and job losses. Even after cutting their 1994 budgets, the multinational oil companies which operate the joint ventures in Nigeria have been owed at least Dollars 800m by the state this year. Nigeria's lack of access to new capital is holding up some big projects. A Dollars 550m investment to produce gas which is currently wasted at Chevron's Escravos fields is in doubt because Nigeria depends for its majority share of the funding on the World Bank, which is critical of Nigeria's economic management. A Dollars 4bn investment, the much-delayed Liquefied Natural Gas project at Bonny, hangs in the balance as Nigeria tries to convince export credit agencies such as the US Eximbank that it is an acceptable country risk. Nigeria will need all the help it can get from oil exports. The government promised in January a balanced 1994 budget, but then announced for the first half of the year a budget deficit of Dollars 1.4bn. Western economists believe this figure was on the low side and are forecasting a deficit heading towards last year's figure of more than Dollars 4bn or 17.5 per cent of gross domestic product. Inflation is nearly 70 per cent and accelerating while economists predict negative GDP growth of around 1 per cent by the end of the year.</p>

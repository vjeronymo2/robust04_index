			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: Rolls-Royce The latest job cuts at Rolls-Royce come as little surprise after the Pounds 50m provided against last year's profits. The stated reasons for the cutbacks, though, beg the question whether this sort of trimming should not have been carried out before. The repercussions of the Gulf crisis, airline finances and Defence Ministry cutbacks are all convenient enough justifications. But the running down of the helicopter factory at Leavesden is the sort of move British Aerospace might have made without waiting for the political climate to be right. Rolls-Royce shares have recently been stalled by the uncertainty over big orders for the Trent engine. New evidence that the cost base is being tackled will reassure those convinced of the stock's long-term attractions.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS commentator Tamara Zamyatina article for </F> ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA: "Russia-Tatarstan Treaty: Key to Political  Stabilization"]    [Text] The Russian president's two-day trip to Tatarstan  confirmed that both the center and the components of the  Federation have become convinced that the country's people can  only live a humane life within an integral state. Otherwise the  alternative is civil and political confrontation, unresolved  socioeconomic problems, and hence national enmity. Conflicts  and impoverishment, which are well known from the bitter  examples of Chechnya, Karabakh, and Abkhazia.    Farsighted politicians such as Tatarstan's president,  Mintimer Shaymiyev, have also realized that talk of separatism  and national independence helped them to come to power but not  to remain at the helm, since you cannot feed the people or boost  the economy on political ambition.    It is customary to think that the bilateral treaty between  Russia and Tatarstan concluded 15 February this year has brought  stability to life in Tatarstan. However, I think that the  treaty was the consequence of conscious necessity and not a  panacea for separatism.    The economy of Tatarstan, as you know, rests on three basic  things -- automobile building, military-industrial complex  enterprises, and the agrarian sector. It was not only First  Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets but also the Tatarstan leadership  who stressed during Boris Yeltsin's trip that without Russian  Government aid the republic would not have managed to refurbish  the KamAZ plant, particularly after last year's fire in the  engine plant.    And the subsequent development of the automobile giant would  have been in jeopardy without the 47 billion rubles [R] in  credit given to KamAZ on the eve of the Russian president's  arrival, without the enterprise's being exempted from profits  and value-added tax until the end of the year, and without  Russian Government guarantees in return for which the Japanese,  inter alia, are giving KamAZ $400 million in credit.    Need one say that the military-industrial complex plants  undergoing conversion in Tatarstan would have long since closed  down without financial injections from the federal budget.    As for the agrarian sector, according to Fatikh  Sibagatullin,  the republic's agriculture minister, since the beginning of the  year alone, R80 billion have been paid out of state coffers to  meet the sector's requirements, and in June Vice Premier  Aleksandr Zaveryukha promised another R35 billion. During a  conversation with your ITAR-TASS commentator, Tatarstan  President Mintimer Shaymiyev also acknowledged that the  republic's agro-industrial complex cannot develop without budget  subsidies.    However, Mintimer Shaymiyev in his mild oriental manner  persuaded Boris Yeltsin of the advisability of an "experiment,"  which boils down to Tatarstan implementing "reforms with a human  face." Thus, low food prices are being retained in Tatarstan,  and privatization is proceeding at a far more restrained pace  than in other regions.    At the same time Tatarstan is paying 5-6 percent of the 20  percent in taxes to the state treasury stipulated in the  bilateral treaty, Vadim Pechenev, deputy head of the Russian  President's Staff Administration for Work with the Territories,  and Emil Pain, an expert in the head of state's staff,  calculated. As a result, since the beginning of the year alone  Tatarstan's debts to Russia have amounted to R43 billion (a  figure cited by Boris Yeltsin in an interview with an ITAR-TASS  commentator), while the total is around R2 trillion.    In order not to hurt the Tatarstan leader's feelings too  much, the Russian president told journalists that the republic's  debts are the result of the universal problem of payment  defaults and Mintimer Shaymiyev has himself promised to pay off  the debts as soon as a financial solution emerges.    But, needless to say, these were just statements for the  press, and behind clsed doors the Tatar side won Boris Yeltsin's  support for the funding of a bridge across the Kama and for the  restoration of the Kazan Kremlin. There was also a request for  money for the modernization of the airport in the republic's  capital. "There are always requests for money despite the  desire for independence," one high-ranking representative of the  Russian delegation commented on the state of affairs.    And Mintimer Shaymiyev was indeed far less keen to discuss  with Boris Yeltsin the question of bringing Tatarstan's  constitution into line with the new Russian Constitution. The  point is that the republic is claiming an autonomous role as a  subject of international relations. What is more, under its  laws soldiers only perform their compulsory military service on  Tatarstan's territory. All that is clearly at variance with the  principles of a federal state.    Thus, the bilateral treaty between Russia and Tatarstan on  the demarcation of areas of jurisdiction has today made it  possible to resolve the main problem -- the problem of political  stabilization. "Tatarstan has been transformed from a region  that was almost used to scare children into one of the calmest  republics for people of different nationalities," Emil Pain  said. Thus, in his view, a weight has been taken off the minds  of both the almost 4 million Tatars living outside the republic  and the Russians in Tatarstan who make up half the republic's  population.    However, Boris Yeltsin summed up the results of his trip by  warning that the treaty should not become just a political  declaration, just a "piece of paper." Concrete efforts are  needed to implement it on both sides, which was why a bilateral  commission, led on the Russian side by First Vice Premier Oleg  Soskovets and on the Tatarstan side by the republic's prime  minister, Mukhammat Sabirov, was formed.    The commission is to work out a mechanism for the operation  of the treaty which presupposes the implementation of a whole  series of federal programs and economic agreements.  Subsequently the format of Russian-Tatarstan bilateral  relations may be used to conclude similar treaties with other  republics, krays, and oblasts in the Federation.    Nevertheless, the center's first experience of settling  relations with Tatarstan can rightly be described as the "golden  key" that opens the doors to constructive ethnic and regional  policy and the creation of a strong state capable of protecting  citizens' interests.</p>

			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tender trap planned for cattle ticks Interrupting the sex life of a humble African cattle tick could help save millions of pounds lost each year through cattle disease and constant applications of insecticide, according to scientists at Britain's Keele University. The brown ear tick, which is about the size of a small grape, attacks cattle by drinking their blood, damaging their hide and milk output and spreading deadly East Coast fever. The fever is prevalent in southern and east Africa, killing about 500,000 cattle each year in the latter region alone. Ticks world-wide are believed to cause about Dollars 7bn worth of damage annually in animal deaths and disease, lost production and veterinary costs. Keele is embarking on a Pounds 60,000 one-year project to find ways of tricking male brown ear ticks into thinking they have found a mate. Research on other ticks in the US has already developed decoys - beads that secrete the female pheromone, the chemical that attracts males. Dr Gordon Hamilton of Keele says the UK research, funded by the Overseas Development Administration, will examine the possibility of adding pheromones to insecticides poured or sprayed onto cattle. 'We hope the pheromones will remain active longer than the pesticide and disrupt mating,' he explains. 'Their presence on the host animal would make the male tick feel the whole animal was a female tick.' The aim is to cut the number of ticks, not to eradicate them, as this would reduce cattle resistance to the disease.</p>

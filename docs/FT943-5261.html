			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / The small-screen dinosaurs now everyone's pets: Patrick Harverson finds potential buyers eyeing once-lumbering US TV networks ABC, CBS and NBC - seemed like lumbering dinosaurs facing a slow decline. Under pressure from nimbler, more innovative competitors such as cable TV companies, independent programme-makers and newcomers such as Fox Television, the networks' share of the national television audience was falling - from 98 per cent in the 1970s to about 60 per cent by the start of the 1990s - and their advertising revenues and profits were sliding. Yet today the dinosaurs have roared back to life and powerful entertainment companies such as Walt Disney, Turner Broadcasting, Time Warner, Paramount and Tele-Communications (TCI), the country's largest cable television operator, now appear eager to own a network. Time Warner and Paramount are even planning to launch their own networks next year. Time Warner is also said to have been negotiating to buy NBC from General Electric; Disney is rumoured to be interested in CBS; while the chairmen of Turner and TCI have stated they would like to own one of the big three networks. Only ABC, deemed too large to swallow whole, is immune from bid speculation. The sudden burst of interest in the networks is driven by several factors. For a start, the economics of the business are improving. The long decline in networks' share of national ratings has been halted, advertising sales are forecast to grow and profits are recovering. There is also a growing realisation that as the number of available television channels increases, so does the value of the network. Mr Scott Siegler, former head of Columbia Pictures Television and an ex-network executive, says: 'I think that the advertising community has become aware of the fact that the more fragmented the market becomes, the more important the big three networks become. They are the only people who, on any given night, can guarantee you 60 per cent of millions of households.' Yet there is another reason why the networks have become attractive to potential buyers: a changing regulatory environment. Since 1971, financial interest-syndication regulations, or 'fin-syn', have barred networks from producing much of their own programming and from participating in the lucrative syndication business - selling re-runs of shows to local stations. The fin-syn rules, however, are due to be eliminated in November 1995, after which networks will be allowed to produce their own shows and reap the profits of syndication. 'With those restrictions lifted, suddenly a network becomes a far more profitable business than it was a few years ago,' says Mr Michael Theodore, media specialist at management consultants Arthur D Little. Programme makers such as Time Warner and Disney want a network because it would help them realise profitable synergies not previously allowed under fin-syn and protect revenues from their existing programming businesses. If the big programme makers do not move into networks soon, they could find themselves when fin-syn expires owning a product for which they cannot find a national outlet. Programme suppliers could try to build a network from scratch. This is what Time Warner is attempting, primarily by persuading independent local television stations to sign up as affiliates for its new WB network, due to start early next year. Time Warner's reported interest in NBC may be motivated by the uncertain future that cable television faces. Earlier this year the government imposed price controls on cable operators and the industry fears further regulation. A bid for NBC would be a good defensive move for Time Warner, whose cable operations include the successful Home Box Office channel. Mr John Reidy, media analyst with securities house Smith Barney Shearson, says Time Warner's interest in NBC 'shows you that Time Warner is very nervous about what's going to happen to its TV production business. It also raises the question of whether they have some doubts about the rapidity of the growth of the cable business'. There are many analysts who doubt whether Time Warner will be able to buy NBC outright, at least not just yet. Until limits on cross-ownership of cable and television stations are eased, Time Warner's options are limited. Mr Richard Grand-Jean, head of the entertainment industry investment banking boutique Global Film Equity, adds: 'They (Time Warner) already have a ton of debt. The world is not really ready to see them take on another Dollars 4bn to Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.2bn) of it.' Even Disney may not be in the best shape to do a deal with CBS after the accidental death in April of its president, Mr Frank Wells, and the imminent departure of its studio chief, Mr Jeffrey Katzenberg. Analysts estimate Disney would need to offer at least Dollars 5bn for CBS. Ultimately, Wall Street believes that CBS or NBC (and possibly both) will change hands within the next year, mainly because they have the wrong owners who, moreover, appear to want to get out of the business. As Mr Theodore puts it: 'People always felt that GE and NBC was a poor match. 'As for CBS, Larry Tisch is not a broadcaster, and he does not have much of an idea about the direction the industry is heading. At this point, I think he wants to take the money and run.'</p>

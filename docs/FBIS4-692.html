			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by M Merten] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 13 SAPA -- About 16,000 Umkhonto  we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation, MK; ANC military wing] soldiers  would gather at three MK-administered assembly points in the  Transvaal from next week, MK Commissar Andrew Masondo said on  Wednesday [13 April].    About 8,000 troops were expected at Walmansthal, north of  Pretoria, 2,500 at Bourke's Luck in the Eastern Transvaal and  1,500 at Hoedspruit in the Western Transvaal.    Speaking at a media briefing in Johannesburg, Mr Masondo  said  the aim of the integration process was to ensure a stable  security force which could protect the new South Africa.    MK soldiers did not need any special motivation to report at  the assembly points. "Those who want to be soldiers have no  qualm about going to the points. As soon as a new South African  defence force is created... MK will no longer exist," he said.    Mr Masondo said the 16,000 troops included expatriates. MK  assets such as military hardware and vehicles kept in other  countries would also become part of the new defence force.    MK soldiers would be trained over three to six months to  play  a non-partisan role in the new defence force, according to a  code of conduct still to be finalised by the Transitional  Executive Council.    MK soldiers would not have to learn new military skills,  although they would have to adapt to different technologies.  Training would focus on building a new attitude and culture of  peace and progress, Mr Masondo said.    A new defence force commander would be determined by the new  state president, he added.    MK remained committed to reconciliation and peace, he said,  assuring communities living near the assembly points that they  would not be threatened by the troops. "The new South Africa  will need a new military culture... of non-racialism, equality  for all, particularly women, as well as good relations with the  neighbouring states," Mr Masondo said.</p>

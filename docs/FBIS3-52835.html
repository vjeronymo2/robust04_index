Thousands of people are fleeing the capital, Kabul.  The truce came into effect at 0600 today. The cease-fire  appeal was made by Pakistan to evacuate diplomats, aid workers,  and the wounded to safer places. Pakistan had urged the warring  factions to start negotiations for resolving the present crisis.  A convoy of about 70 vehicles carrying foreign nationals and  diplomats has left Kabul. Thursday's bombardment has caused  extensive damage in the center of the city. Markets and shops  are ablaze and the streets are littered with debris.    Pakistan has offered to use its good offices to end the  fighting. According to informed sources, Iran, Turkey, Libya,  and China have asked Pakistan to take the first step and try to  convince the warring factions for a complete cease-fire. Iran  and Saudi Arabia will later join these efforts to bring normalcy  in the war-torn country.</p>

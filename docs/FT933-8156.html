			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK facing free trade 'quagmire' NORTHERN FOODS, the UK food manufacturer, says 'a quagmire' will result from the replacement of the Milk Marketing Board by a 'monopoly broker', when the milk industry in England and Wales is opened to competition next year. In a paper on the new milk market, Northern Foods points out that Milk Marque, the MMB's successor, will have a dominant position but no processing facilities, given the planned flotation of Dairy Crest, the MMB's trading arm. Therefore the imbalance between supply and demand during the year might tempt Milk Marque to do special deals with milk processors, says the food group, whose Northern Milk Partnership, run jointly with dairy farmers, is the leading rival to Milk Marque. Mr Neil Davidson, group executive in charge of milk policy at Northern Foods, points out that for 10 months of the year there is not enough milk left over, once fresh market demand is satisfied, to make use of all the processing capacity available to convert it into cheese, butter or skimmed milk. But the opposite is true twice a year - in the spring and over Christmas and New Year - when excess milk supplies are large. If these processors insist on fixed quantities of milk at special prices in return for accommodating Milk Marque at its most vulnerable time, this would run counter to the need for Milk Marque to be open and fair with all buyers of milk under competition law, says Mr Davidson. The same would be true, he argues, if Milk Marque offered processors of fresh milk products special deals in order to overcome potential dissatisfaction over the premiums they will have to pay to be sure of obtaining the supplies they need. 'All of this amounts to a quagmire which would not exist but for the presence of a monopoly broker,' he says. Mr Davidson also questions the justification for the MMB's claim that Milk Marque will pay UK producers among the highest prices in Europe. Some northern European milk farmers are paid more than UK producers because their input costs are higher and because they tend to sell their milk directly to the consumer through co-operatives, he says. If Milk Marque did achieve such prices, he suggests, it would be 'by trying to use its monopoly muscle' and the consumer would have to pay.</p>

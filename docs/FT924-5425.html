			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Identifying the shape of bins to come / A look at the link between good design and success It was Thomas J Watson, the former chairman of International Business Machines, who coined the phrase 'good design is good business'. In the 1950s, Watson inculcated a tradition of excellence in product design, graphics and architecture that has persisted within his company to this day. Watson's phrase is oft-repeated, though mainly by designers rather than their clients. But the truth is rather more complicated. Is good design bad business? A number of high-profile design users have recently experienced difficulties. In some cases, design is connected with downfall. In others, it provided a means of escape. The new Lotus Elan won a Design Council award in 1989, but the car was never economical to build. Design was not to blame, however. In addition to coming on to the market as the recession took hold, the new Elan required expensive refitting to meet safety requirements imposed by its owner, General Motors. Had the stubby design been just the first in a line of models culminating in four-wheel-drive four-seaters as GM intended, the design strategy would have been vindicated, says Graham Arnold of Club Lotus. 'When they scrapped the Elan, they scrapped Lotus's future in one fell swoop.' Belling also won awards for a new range of cookers introduced in 1990, but the company went into receivership in May 1992. These cookers were one factor that made Belling attractive to Dimplex as a going concern, but if the company had invested earlier in design, might its difficulties have been avoided entirely? According to Andrew Smith, now marketing planning manager of the Belling Cooker Division of Dimplex UK: 'The company went down for reasons more to do with the overall market than with individual models in the market. By maintaining competitive prices we doubled market share, but the competitive prices undermined profitability.' Belling's design consultant, Paul Priestman, had been brought in to move the company's dowdy product image up-market. He believes that if the company had invested earlier in design, it could have penetrated vital foreign markets and higher-priced sectors early enough to avoid collapse. Good design, then, is not a sufficient condition for good business. Is it even necessary? The Design Business Association, which represents design consultancies, set up its biennial Design Effectiveness Awards in 1988 to judge design, not on the customary basis of aesthetics, but on success in the market. Packaging for Highland Spring mineral water by Michael Peters and Partners was the first overall winner. In 1990, the prize went to a range of electric shavers designed for Boots by Fitch RS. The products reversed a decline in market share and sales increased by 80 per cent in a year. The difficulty is to quantify the contribution of design. Says Barbara Walker, associate director responsible for marketing from the Confederation of British Industry: 'Little is known about design effectiveness at a project level. It is difficult to come up with hard figures because it is interwoven with other things.' Walker is organising seminars to analyse the separate roles of advertising, design and corporate videos. This year's Design Effectiveness Awards will be presented at a ceremony next Tuesday. The winners will have presented sound quantitative evidence to support their case. Sir Anthony Cleaver, chairman of IBM (UK) who chaired the panel of judges, says he was impressed by some entrants' scientific method, shown in their willingness to treat a new product development almost as an experiment, isolating design from other variables such as advertising spending. 'They created a backcloth against which they could measure the success of the design.' One finalist in the product design category is a waste container made by Egbert H Taylor, certainly not an object that would win an aesthetic design award. The new plastic design replaces a traditional steel container. The brief required new functions to be introduced at no extra cost and new European standards to be met. Colin Stanwell-Smith of design consultancy Cosine says: 'We had to make it look credible. It looked terrible before although it basically did the same job.' Like other finalists, Stanwell-Smith and Taylor presented an analysis showing that design was a discrete factor that could otherwise have been left out. The containers are becoming more visible to the general public because of roadside recycling, but this activity accounts for a very small proportion of sales. The market - mainly local authorities - is well known and understood by Taylor, and this is not the sort of product to be launched with an advertising blitz. Thus, the design was the only change. Each year since the launch, sales have increased by 40 per cent and market share has risen from 40 to 55 per cent.</p>

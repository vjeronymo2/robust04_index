			<p><P> November 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRACKPOTS KEEP THE LID ON FETAL-TISSUE RESEARCH;  </P> <P> MEDICINE: EXPERIMENTS THAT PROMISE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON DISEASED HUMAN ORGANS  ARE STYMIED BY ABORTION FOES.  </P> <P> With the extension of an irrational ban started by the Reagan Administration,  the crackpots have won again on forbidding federal money for promising research  on Parkinson's and other serious diseases. The triumph extends an ideological  rampage that has dismayed the medical research establishment and caused several  distinguished scientists to reject invitations to take senior government posts.  </P> <P> After a deliberation -- for which the outcome was never in doubt -- the Bush  Administration recently announced that it would retain the prohibition against  the use of federal funds for research involving the transplantation of fetal  tissue from induced abortions. Never mind that early experiments indicate that  transplanted fetal tissue has beneficial effects on diseased organs, and may be  useful against a variety of dreadful maladies. Or that two panels of  specialists appointed by the federal government concluded that the research  should proceed.  </P> <P> For abortion foes, who fill the upper ranks of the health bureaucracy in the  Bush Administration, there's the far- fetched fear that hesitant women might be  swayed toward abortion by the prospect of helping the sick. Therefore, it's  impermissible, because, as Asst. Secretary of Health James O. Mason, an  abortion foe, told the New York Times, the ban was "a matter of heart and mind  as well."  </P> <P> No doubt, but the scientists who studied the controversy for the federal  government concluded that safeguards could easily be devised to guard against  exploitation of women contemplating abortion. A simple one, for example, would  prohibit payment for aborted fetuses. The experimental results obtained so far  with fetal tissue -- which is fast-growing and resistant to rejection -- have  actually been mixed. But some have been so favorable that medical researchers  believe that further research could lead to effective treatments for several  dreadful maladies. Besides Parkinson's disease, these include Alzheimer's  disease and childhood diabetes. The research may proceed with private funds,  and some is in progress. But Washington is the great bankroll and influence in  health research, and the Bush Administration's endorsement of the ban will  continue a dampening effect on this line of research.  </P> <P> The ban demonstrates anew the grip of the anti-abortion movement on the  Department of Health and Human Services, the giant federal agency for medical  service and research, and the ideological straitjacket that the right-to-life  gang has made the uniform of the day for federal service.  </P></p>

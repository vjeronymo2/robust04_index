			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Government body fails to meet training target THE Employment Service, the government agency that helps the unemployed find work and pays out unemployment benefit, yesterday admitted that it had failed to meet its training target. The target, one of a number set annually by Mr Michael Howard, the employment secretary, specified that for every 2.5 people the service refers to Employment Training, the government scheme which aims to help the long-term unemployed return to work, one person should take up a place. In the current quarter, one person starts a course for every 2.9 people who are referred. Mr Ron Leighton, Labour chairman of the Commons employment committee, said the gap was 'a major shortfall'. Mr Leighton asked Mr Michael Fogden, chief executive of the Employment Service, whether the shortfall had arisen because the number of training places available was fewer than promised. Mr Fogden said the shortfall could not be attributed to the number of places available. He said: 'It is about the quality of our selectiveness and advisory skills.' This week the Labour party accused the government of underspending the Employment Training budget by Pounds 70m and raiding the budget to make good its promises on the parallel Youth Training scheme. Mr Fogden said the figures were an improvement on the last quarter, when for every person starting training, 3.2 people had been referred.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by unidentified XINHUA special correspondent: "The </F> Number `10,000' Undergirds the Effort To Transform Operating  Mechanisms and Establish a Modern Enterprise System"]    [Text] To implement the principle of combining package  reform with breakthroughs in key areas as set forth in the  "Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee, a national economic and trade work conference last  year put forward the plan for "transforming the operating  mechanisms of or establishing a modern enterprise system in  10,000 large and medium state enterprises, 1,000 key  enterprises, 100 different types of large and medium state  enterprises, and enterprises in 10 cities or prefectures." The  practice of transforming operating mechanisms or establishing a  modern enterprise system encapsulates the second section of the  "Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee: We should advance enterprise-related work and  enterprise reform on all fronts, and all state enterprises  should effectively implement the "Regulations Governing the  Change of Operating Mechanisms in State-Owned Industrial  Enterprises" and the soon-to-be-promulgated "Regulations on the  Supervision and Management of Property in State-Owned  Enterprises," focus on changing their operating mechanisms, and  create conditions and lay the groundwork for establishing a  modern enterprise system. The numbers "10,000, 1,000, 100, and  10" give concrete expression to achieving breakthroughs in key  areas in the current enterprise reform. This means achieving  breakthroughs in key areas to promote overall reform through the  pioneering role of some enterprises and through supplementary  reform in some cities. The number "10,000" undergirds this  effort.    The number "10,000" means fully granting approximately  10,000  state enterprises the 14 types of operational rights which  enterprises are supposed to enjoy according to the "Regulations  Governing the Change of Operating Mechanisms in State-Owned  Industrial Enterprises." It also means making great efforts to  realize the transformation of operating mechanisms, effectively  implementing the "two sets of rules," and completing the  appraisal of fixed assets and working capital, so as to lay a  solid foundation for establishing a modern enterprise system and  for advancing toward the market. This is completely consistent  with the goal set by the State Council of increasing the  proportion of well-run large and medium state enterprises from  one-third to two-thirds by the end of the "Eighth Five-Year  Plan."    In implementing the "Regulations Governing the Change of  Operating Mechanisms in State-Owned Industrial Enterprises," we  should mainly carry out four tasks: 1) Promulgating and  implementing supplementary rules and regulations; 2) continuing  to intensify publicity efforts, investigating and dealing with  cases in which the "Regulations Governing the Change of  Operating Mechanisms in State-Owned Industrial Enterprises" are  violated and retaliatory action is taken against enterprises,  and exposing those cases in the news media or even investigating  legal responsibilities; 3) continuing to promote the  transformation of governmental functions, granting enterprises  operational rights, and accelerating the reform of government  bodies; and 4) encouraging enterprises to turn inward, combine  their operational rights and responsibilities, and use the  rights at their disposal to transform their operating  mechanisms. To carry out these tasks, we should focus on  granting enterprises the right to independently conduct export  trade and to refuse to share financial charges, improve  procedures for examining and approving applications for  permission to independently conduct export and import trade  through simplified formalities and greater efficiency. We  should allow enterprises, which have been granted the right to  independently conduct the export and import trade, to enjoy the  same power as foreign trade enterprises in terms of export  licenses and quotas. We should consider the effort to halt the  practice of collecting unwarranted fees an important aspect of  the anticorruption struggle. All localities and businesses  should formulate specific measures in light of their actual  conditions to halt the practice, publish those measures, and  allow enterprises to oversee the implementation of those  measures. We should make active efforts to create conditions,  and guide and assist enterprises in instituting self-control  mechanisms so they will operate in accordance with the law and  assume responsibility for their own profits and losses and for  preserving and increasing the value of state assets. This year,  all localities and departments should uncover and nurture a  number of exemplary enterprises which have successfully changed  their operating mechanisms, and which are well-managed and  efficient, and they should sum up and promote the advanced  experiences of these enterprises.  In implementing the "two sets of rules," we also should  primarily carry out four tasks: 1) Further tracking,  ascertaining, and correctly understanding the situation, and  promoting the implementation of the "two sets of rules" and the  Finance Ministry's "Circular on the Question of Harmonizing  Policies on Implementing the New Enterprise Financial System";  2) Aligning the "two sets of rules" with the "Interim  Regulations on Enterprise Income Tax" and other new tax codes,  and promptly addressing the common problems of enterprises in  implementing the new tax system; 3) Continuing to perfect the  enterprise financial and accounting system in accordance with  the demands of the "Company Law" and the new tax system; and 4)  Actively searching for a management accounting system with  Chinese characteristics that meets the demands of a modern  enterprise system.    Enterprises should perfect their cost accounting system,  enhance their capacity for continued development, and ensure  that the value of state assets is preserved and increased.  Backbone state enterprises which can cope with the situation  may quicken the pace of depreciation after obtaining approval to  do so. To the extent permitted by state policies, state  enterprises may raise money through various channels to  supplement their capital, and wholly state-owned enterprises,  which have been around for a long time and which will be exempt  from delivering their after-tax profits to the state in the near  future, may increase their common reserve funds and public  welfare funds with the surplus money in accordance with the "two  sets of rules."    During this year's appraisal of fixed assets and working  capital, we should bring 10,000 large and medium state  enterprises within the scope of our appraisal, and these include  pilot enterprises that will implement the system of appointed  supervisory boards and the modern enterprise system, all state  enterprises in the 10 cities designated for experimenting with  the practice of "optimizing the capital structure and  invigorating enterprises," and two-thirds of large and medium  enterprises in all localities whose fixed assets and working  capital have not been appraised. We should take care to  coordinate efforts and solve problems in the course of  implementation to ensure that the task of appraising fixed  assets and working capital is completed with good qualitative  and quantitative results. Along with the transformation of  governmental functions, we should improve our work in appraising  fixed assets and working capital and give full rein to the roles  of certified public accountants, registered auditors, and other  intermediary agencies in society.    The plan for "transforming the operating mechanisms of or  establishing a modern enterprise system in 10,000 large and  medium state enterprises, 1,000 key enterprises, 100 different  types of large and medium state enterprises, and enterprises in  10 cities or prefectures" is a new concept for improving large  and medium state enterprises in the new situation. We should  seriously study and publicize the "Decision" of the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the  "Company Law," and increase our understanding of the importance,  urgency, and arduousness of changing the operating mechanisms of  state enterprises and of establishing a modern enterprise  system. The principal leaders of economic and trade commissions  in all localities should concentrate on undertaking meticulous  efforts, organizationally and in terms of leadership; they  should devote painstaking and major efforts to tracking the way  the "two sets of rules" are implemented in 10,000 large and  medium state enterprises so as to make substantial progress this  year.</p>

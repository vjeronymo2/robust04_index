			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: Macy asks for more time R. H. Macy, the bankrupt US department store group operating under Chapter 11 protection for more than two years, yesterday asked for another six months' extension of its exclusive right to come up with a reorganisation plan. Macy faces a takeover threat from the Federated Department Stores group, owner of Bloomingdale's, which last month procured part of Macy's secured debt and won the right to come up with its own reorganisation plan. But it has indicated that it will wait for Macy to file a plan before it comes up with its own.</p>

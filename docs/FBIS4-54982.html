			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["(pes)"-signed report: "Exports From Our Republic Have </F> Declined This Year"]    [Text] Prague -- The Czech Republic's foreign trade  turnover during the first three months of this year increased by  4.8 percent compared with the same period of 1993; of this,  imports rose by 15.9 percent and exports fell by 4.3 percent.  This is apparent from the figures released by the Czech  Statistical Office.    States with an advanced market economy had a 60.8-percent  share in the republic's overall foreign trade turnover (European  Union states had a 42.8-percent share and European Free Trade  Association [EFTA] states had a 12.3-percent share). The Slovak  Republic accounted for 15.2 percent; the countries of the former  Soviet Union for 10.3 percent; developing countries for 7.3  percent; European states with a transitional economy (excluding  the countries of the former USSR) for 5.6 percent; and states  with a state-controlled trading system for 0.8 percent.    Imports in all categories rose. However, imports from  Slovakia fell by 16.6 percent compared with the January-March  period of 1993. Imports from states with a state-controlled  trading system (index 144.2) and from European states with a  transitional economy, excluding the countries of the former  USSR, (index 132.7) rose most dynamically.    Despite the overall decline in exports, exports to EFTA  states (index 161.6) rose. This was mainly due to the dynamism  of our exports to Austria (index 169.0). Exports to Austria  accounted for almost 10 percent of the Czech Republic's overall  exports. Exports to developing countries (index 120.8)  continued to increase. The most substantial decline in exports  -- apart from exports to states with a state-controlled trading  system, which, however, have a small share in overall exports --  was to Slovakia. Exports to Slovakia reached only 66.5 percent  of the level for the first quarter of 1993, which represents a  reduction of 6.6 billion korunas [Kc].    Imports from OECD countries during the first quarter  amounted  to Kc48.6 billion and exports amounted to Kc54.9 billion. The  balance of trade was in the black by Kc6.3 billion. Compared  with the same period last year, imports from OECD countries rose  by 23 percent and exports to these countries rose by 13.8  percent.    The balance of trade for the first three months of 1994  showed a surplus of Kc1.7 billion. A surplus was achieved in  trade with all territories, except the former Soviet Union,  where there was a deficit of Kc8.5 billion. The surplus with  European Union states amounted to Kc4.4 billion; with developing  countries to Kc3.4 billion; with EFTA states to Kc1.3 billion;  with European states with a transitional economy (excluding the  countries of the former USSR) to Kc0.6 billion; and with states  with a state-controlled trading system to Kc0.3 billion.    In overall imports from January to March 1994, the Federal  Republic of Germany had a 23.1-percent share; the Slovak  Republic had a 15-percent share; and Russia had a 13.8-percent  share. Imports from Brazil (a 0.3-percent share in overall  imports), Canada (0.7 percent), South Korea (0.6 percent), China  (0.6 percent), Denmark (1.0 percent), and Switzerland (2.1  percent) grew most rapidly compared with the same period last  year. Imports from Egypt and Bulgaria fell.    During the same period, 29.1 percent of the Czech Republic's  exports went to the Federal Republic of Germany. Some 15.5  percent went to Slovakia; 9.8 percent to Austria; 3.2 percent to  the United Kingdom; and 3.2 percent to Russia. Compared with  the January-March period of 1993, exports to Turkey (a 1.9  percent share in overall exports); Japan (1.5 percent); Taiwan  (0.4 percent); Hong Kong (1.6 percent); and Brazil (0.1 percent)  increased most. Exports to China, Denmark, Romania, and  Slovenia declined considerably.    From January to March 1994, in the structure of imports  according to the categories of goods, the percentage of imports  of machinery and means of transportation declined by 3.5 points  compared with the same period last year. The percentage of  imports of fuels and raw and processed materials in overall  imports rose by 2.6 points and the percentage of industrial  consumer goods rose by 0.9 points. The percentage of imports of  foodstuffs remained the same. The value of imports, compared  with the first quarter of last year, increased for all  categories of goods. During the first three months of 1994, 1.7  million tonnes of oil (1.5 million tonnes during the same period  last year) and 3.1 billion cubic meters of natural gas (1.7  billion cubic meters last year) were imported.    During the first quarter of 1994, in the structure of  exports  according to the categories of goods, the percentage of imports  of fuels and raw and processed materials and industrial consumer  goods rose by 2.1 and 3.0 points respectively compared with the  same period last year. On the other hand, the percentage of  exports of machinery and means of transport declined by 2.4  points and foodstuffs declined by 2.7 points. Compared with the  first three months of 1993, only exports in the industrial goods  category rose, by 19.1 percent.</p>

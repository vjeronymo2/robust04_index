			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Konstantin Pribytkov] </F>   [Text] Geneva April 15 TASS -- Delegations from Georgia and  its separatist province of Abkhazia failed to reach a compromise  on where to deploy UN peacekeepers.    The UN- and Russia-brokered four-day talks were held in  accordance with accords signed in Moscow early in April.    The sides remained adamant in their approach to a proposed  stationing of the UN peacekeepers. Abkhazia suggests they must  be deployed along the border river of Inguri, while Georgia says  peacekeepers should control the whole territory of the breakaway  province.</p>

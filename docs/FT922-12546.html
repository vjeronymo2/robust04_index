			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): The medium is not the message / A look at the lessons for promoting political parties The 1992 British general election serves as a healthy reminder that communications is more black art than well-crafted logic. The Liberal-Democrats had almost as much free media coverage as the two leading parties. They came a poor third. Labour (once more) was widely tipped to scoop the Oscars, thanks to positive advertising and consistent design. It did worse than most observers expected. The victorious Tories were widely accused of being lacklustre and unimaginative, using negative images - tax bombshells and ball-and-chains - shifting at the last minute to an upbeat promotion of a smiling John Major. Any post-mortem should take note of the parties' relative promotional spending. But according to the Conservative communications team, they spent just Pounds 3m on all communications (including press advertising, posters and election broadcasts) - less than a third spent in the 1987 election. At the start of the 1992 campaign, Central Office officials hinted that they had a Pounds 20m fighting fund; that now appears to be a tactically placed exaggeration. According to Concord Posterlink, a specialist outdoor buying agency, political posters accounted for 17 per cent of the Pounds 2.7m roadside advertising spend during the four weeks' of the election. The Conservatives' took a 56 per cent share, against 28 per cent for Labour and 6.5 per cent for the Lib-Dems. Labour spent an estimated Pounds 1 1/2 m on press advertising; the Conservatives claim to have used just Pounds 1m. In any case, cash is not everything; Haagen-Dazs ice cream (owned by Grand Metropolitan), was launched mid-1991 on an advertising budget of just Pounds 300,000. It now has a 20 per cent share of the UK dairy ice-cream sector, selling more than twice its two nearest competitors combined. If marketing style meant victory, then Labour's final campaign rally in Sheffield - all glitz and glamour - should have clinched things. But for some of the Labour's communications team, the election result was a shock, though perhaps not altogether a surprise. The team of 25 came from two main sources; unpaid volunteers working after-hours from the agency BMP DDB Needham - led by Chris Powell, 25 years a Labour party member - and from Philip Gould Associates. Labour's team held daily 'quality research' sessions with groups of some 10 undecided voters. According to one senior member, that research indicated that the 'undecideds' were 'greater in number than usual and were Tory in their values - that was consistently the case throughout the campaign'. On one issue Labour and Conservative communications people agree - Labour was sunk by tax. 'It was clearly a mistake for Labour to have tried to fight a campaign by promising tax increases; that saddled the marketing of the campaign with an uphill task,' said one of the shadow communications staff. Shaun Woodward, the Conservative director of communications, agrees. 'The shadow budget was a gift for us'. One key member of Labour's advertising team believes that the Tories' 'Tax Bombshell' image was effective. 'The message got home. But to attribute the success of an election to an advertising agency would be ludicrous.' The tax bombshell, like most of the Conservative images during the campaign, gets no prizes for subtlety. But Woodward says 'the role of advertising is over-emphasised - you win elections because people think you have got the right policies. Labour lost because they allowed the backroom boys to take over from the politicians.' David Hill, Labour's communications director, blames a vituperatively anti-Labour tabloid press. But he agrees that the party under-estimated the electorate's mistrust of Labour and failed to grasp how far 'Thatcherite individualism' has seeped into mass sentiment. Bill Muirhead, chairman of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and one of the leading figures of the Conservatives' advertising team, says: 'We weren't swayed by adverse media opinion. We had pinned to the office wall a large notice which read: 'Hold fast to the basic idea. Do not give in to the pressures of the moment.'' Knight Ritchie, the Liberal-Democrat's agency, adds: 'Why should we think that advertising should be that influential?' However, one thing is emerging from the inquest, which is, as Woodward puts it: 'You start fighting the next election the day after winning the last one.'</p>

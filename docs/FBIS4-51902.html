			<p>BFN       [Editorial report] The following is a compilation of  articles and editorials published in Seoul vernacular newspapers  on 4 May on North Korean moves to replace the Armistice  Agreement with a peace treaty and to disband the Military  Armistice Commission, MAC.    The conservative CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 5 an  1,400-word article by An Hui-chang entitled: "Experts' View on  North Korea's Recent Moves."    Describing North Korea's recent military moves -- including  the approach of planes to the Military Demarcation Line -- as  "unprecedented," the article notes that ROK experts on the North  Korean issue generally agree that the moves are aimed at  "weakening the system of the Armistice Agreement, while telling  the United States that the issue of signing a peace treaty will  be raised in the upcoming third round of high-level official  talks."    Summing up various experts' opinions, the paper notes North  Korea's military moves are "to clarify its present stance to the  United States by intentionally creating a situation in which the  Armistice Agreement itself is still maintained, while  undertaking a series of military moves violating such an  agreement," and "to make the U.S. military forces withdraw from  the ROK." Noting the timing of North Korea's proposal on  replacing the Armistice Agreement, the experts analyzed that  such a proposal is apparently aimed at "distracting attention  away from the nuclear issue facing North Korea," "sitting down  with only U.S. officials while excluding the South Koreans," and  "showing its peaceful face to the international community to  recover its image which suffered from the remark on 'turning  Seoul into a sea of fire'." The article concludes by calling on  the ROK Government to map out "long-term measures" to counter  North Korea's "strange actions."    The moderate HANGUK ILBO publishes on page 2 a 700-word  article by Song Tae-kyu on the reaction of the ROK Defense  Ministry and the UN Command, UNC, to North Korea's decision to  withdraw from the MAC. The article notes that their first  reaction was "indifferent" since this is not the first time  North Korea demonstrated peculiar actions and North Korea has  not officially informed the MAC of its decision.    The paper reports that the Defense Ministry and UNC accused  North Korea of trying "to neutralize the MAC and divert the  international community's attention away from their nuclear  suspicion" and interprets this move as a "tactic to replace the  existing Armistice Agreement with a peace treaty favorable to  them and also to have talks on its nuclear and other issues with  the United States only, excluding South Korea." Reporting on  the North's pledge to maintain the telephone hotlines between  the South and North military authorities, the paper analyzed  this as the North's plot to gain a favorable position in the  coming negotiations over its nuclear development.    The article concludes that the Defense Ministry and the UNC,  charging the move as an apparent violation of the Armistice  Agreement, have mapped out a plan to take appropriate measures  against the North after consulting with the countries concerned.    The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN publishes on page 3 a 800-  editorial noting that such moves by North Korea shows its  unwillingness to discuss any issue with the ROK delegates and  that "such an unprecedented attitude of North Korea will all the  more heighten tension on the Korean peninsula" and questions  "the true intention of North Korea," which is "contradictory --  calling for great national unity, but only attempting to open  dialogue with the United States, excluding South Korea." The  editorial calls on the government to provide the people with  precise and honest information about the current situation and  cautions against exaggerating the situation for political  purposes, as the past authoritarian regimes frequently did.    The moderate HANGUK ILBO and KYONGHYANG SINMUN both publish  on page 3 800-word editorials regarding North Korea's decision  to withdraw from the MAC. The editorials note that the North  Korean proposal is nothing but the reiteration of a  long-standing demand to replace the Armistice Agreement with a  peace treaty. The editorials, however, interpret that the  motivation for the recent proposal is to achieve an equal  footing with the United States and to eliminate the ROK's role  in the Korean security setup. The editorials call on the ROK  Government to beef up the ROK-U.S. cooperation system and assume  a stern stance toward North Korea's possible provocative acts.</p>

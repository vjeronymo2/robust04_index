			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Sport: Learning at Oxbridge - Cricket One could perhaps be forgiven for wondering whether Oxford University's outstanding success last year - 10 matches, two wins and eight draws in their first season undefeated since 1900 - was partly attributable to a revival of the sport-above-all tradition. Seven of the 1st XI went to Keble, a college much more famous for its cricket, rugby and rowing than for its books when I was at Oxford in the late 1960s. And six of the team were graduates and experienced sportsmen. But I was assured by Dr Simon Porter of Nuffield College, and hon treasurer of Oxford University Cricket Club, that brains are what matters. 'Brains are good for cricket,' he said. Mike Atherton today, and Mike Brearley in the 1960s, have both captained Cambridge and England, and both always give the impression that they have an idea in reserve while on the field. So how valuable is captaincy? 'It's crucial. Clever captains win matches. Ray Illingworth understands that; he did it himself. Away from university, I know, but I wouldn't be at all surprised if he works well with Atherton,' said Porter. Atherton is at once a modern and a traditional figure of Cambridge cricket - modern in that he worked hard and did well academically; traditional in his captaincy and batting skills. In the past, cricket often mattered more than academic ability in retaining a place at Oxford or Cambridge. Ian Peebles kept a place at Braesenose College, Oxford, in 1929 because he was playing cricket well for Middlesex. Worried about his law prelim, he asked his tutor how he had done. In his autobiography A Spinner's Yarn he describes the tutor's answer: 'He eyed me with doleful countenance. 'You got 1 per cent in one subject,' he said 'But you were not quite so successful in the others.'' Peebles was not sent down and took 13 Cambridge wickets with his leg-spinners in the 1930 Varsity Match. Today, students work hard at both. 'Some of our present chaps are exceptional. They do two or three hours work early in the morning, play cricket all day, then work two or three more hours in the evening. I admire that. It only works with a good coach (John Lenham of Kent) to keep them keen and well trained,' says Porter. Strong batting and fast fielding, including wicket-keeping, have always been undergraduate specialities, usually alongside uncertain bowling. I was not surprised that most county cricketers picked out the youth and fragility of university cricket as part of its appeal - probably because it can be plundered for cheap batting points. But Oxford and Cambridge hold up their weaknesses in defence of their first-class status. 'Young players get a chance to develop in another system besides the county system to help them learn the game,' says Porter. But the reality is that university cricket is seldom good enough to compete with county cricket. In 1878 Cambridge University beat the Australians and clearly had plenty to teach anyone who was interested. No one would expect Cambridge to beat Australia now. Even so, Kim Barnett of Derbyshire was just one of several county captains who mentioned Cambridge and Oxford as good teaching places for county, as well as university, players. He explained: 'We like to blood our younger and less experienced players against Cambridge. It gives them a first class game in a friendly atmosphere. An early fixture against Cambridge helps us to work up to full power for the season.' Oxford University v Cambridge University is the oldest first-class cricket fixture. First played in 1827, it has traditionally had an air of glamour and panache, like all cricket played by the two universities. This year's match take place at Lord's on June 29. But there is a danger that Oxbridge cricket could fall short of first-class cricket, on the road to its own first-class extinction. It is time Oxford and Cambridge helped their cricketers fight the cause of university cricket. Variety is the spice of life and a variety of cricket is the spice of a first-class summer.

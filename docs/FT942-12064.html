			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / US upbeat on Syrian peace initiative The comprehensive peace settlement eluding the Middle East appeared to edge forward yesterday as a result of peace proposals brokered between Syria and Israel over the weekend. Israel said it was listening with 'great interest' to Syrian proposals delivered to Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, by US Secretary of State Warren Christopher. Israeli officials said the new Syrian proposals appeared to mark a new recognition on the part of Damascus to discuss Israel's security needs. However, Israel's deputy defence minister poured scorn on Mr Christopher's shuttle diplomacy saying the US secretary of state had failed to deliver anything that would allow Israel to say they were entering a more serious Syrian negotiations. The usually cautious Mr Christopher said the two parties were now 'talking on a comprehensive range of issues' and had entered a 'new, more substantive phase'. A breakthrough in negotiations with Syria remains the key to a comprehensive regional peace accord between Israel and her Arab neighbours, including Lebanon and Jordan. The initiative emerged after Damascus rejected the idea of an Israeli withdrawal from the strategic Golan Heights, occupied by Israel in 1967, which Mr Christopher presented to President Hafez al-Assad in Damascus on Saturday. Israel, hoping tomorrow's peace agreement with Palestinians will unblock peace talks with Syria, had offered Syria a three-stage withdrawal from the Heights. Israeli media reported that under the Israeli package, Israel proposed a pull-out in three stages over five to eight years. In the first stage, Israel would hand over some territory, including Druze Arab villages, in return for establishing diplomatic relations and security guarantees. In the second phase Israel would dismantle Jewish settlements and consolidate security arrangements including a large demilitarised zone. The Israeli proposal, was the first time the Jewish state has offered such a comprehensive withdrawal package. Syria, however, rejected the Israeli proposals. Mr Farouq al-Shara, the Syrian foreign minister, said the Israeli proposals 'did not cause any change in the Syrian position. Full Israeli withdrawal is the basis for the peace process.' However, behind the rhetoric, Israeli and US officials said Damascus had formulated an interesting alternative set of proposals in eight hours of meetings with Mr Christopher on Saturday and Sunday. The Syrian proposals will form a basis for talks with further US mediation.</p>

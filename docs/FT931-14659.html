			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Travel: The hunters with feathers in their caps - Nicholas Woodsworth follows the trail of a band of big-game enthusiasts in the Alps and asks: is it right to kill animals for fun? PERCHED on a ridge amid gloomy stands of pine, the little hamlet of Unter Gosing is not the easiest of places to get to. It sits in the isolated Otscherland, in a part of Lower Austria where the Alps break up into steep, thickly-wooded hills before tailing off into the broad plains of eastern Europe. Foresters, loggers and small-scale hill farmers live in its valleys. Its upper reaches have a different population - they are much favoured by mountain chamois, moufflon, roebuck, red stag, and the men who hunt them. To get there I had left the comforts of the Danube and driven high into the hills through the towns of Ybbs, Scheibbs and Puchenstuben. The wilder the names became, the wilder the country too. Up I snaked through steep-sided valleys, towards a blanket of autumn mist. By the time I pulled up outside the Gosing Alpenkurhotel in the late afternoon, the mist was curling through pine forests below me; I felt as if I had arrived at the end of the Earth. Could this be the right hotel? Surely not, I thought. I was in the Otscherland because I was interested in Austrian stag-hunting, much reputed among that shrinking band of enthusiasts still enthralled by guns and big game. But where were the hunters? There were elderly gentlemen wrapped in fluffy white towels shuffling in and out of sauna-rooms. There were stainless steel dispensers marked 'nerve-tee'. There were doors marked 'colon-hydrotherapie'. None of this immediately suggested unbounded machismo and the simple pleasures of the great outdoors. Could hunting, under the scourge of eco-protectionists, greens, anti-vivisectors and others have become quite this limp? The spa-like atmosphere changed dramatically not long after sunset when a small fleet of four-wheel-drive Toyota pick-up trucks crunched to a halt outside. The men who got out were definitely not health-curists, but neither did they measure up to my image of hairy-chested hunters. Apart from the rifles they cradled, they were dressed from head to toe in that rich tyrolean colour, halfway between olive drab and forest green, that is peculiar to the German-speaking Alps. They wore long socks and buckled knee breeches, elegant jackets with silver buttons, long felt capes, and tyrolean hats with silky plumes and braided hat-bands. I had never seen hunters like these. More convincing was the large stag that lay dead in the back of one of the vehicles. I gazed at its ruddy-brown coat, sniffed its pungent zoo smell, fingered the antlers that rose a good 3 feet above its skull. Somewhat guiltily, I avoided the trusting liquid brown eyes that had stayed open: no matter what Hemingway says, wild animals do not remain beautiful even in death. I may have felt guilty, but not guilty enough to avoid the game pate and venison with cranberry sauce offered on the hotel game menu that evening. Surrounded by hunters now busy quaffing beer, downing rich red meat and swapping hunting stories, I discussed my own stag-hunting plans with Octavian Gassaver, the hotel's owner and an avid hunter. Is hunting barbaric, a slaughter of defenseless animals by inadequate individuals? Or, more nobly, is it part of the larger cycle of life and death in the natural world, an age-old survival instinct buried deep in man's culture? These were not questions Herr Gassaver asked me directly. He merely wanted to know whether I preferred to come along as an observer or wanted to carry a rifle and hunt. Simple questions invite more difficult ones, though, and I found myself hesitating, for I have never been able to come down firmly on one side or the other of that most emotive of issues, the morality of blood sports. I am both attracted and repelled by them, and that is why they interest me. Stalking and killing a large wild animal is both exciting and senseless. Is there such a thing as civilised hunting, or is that a contradiction of terms? My first inclination was to believe that it was all rather nasty. Take stag-hunting. When my host told me I would have a good chance of shooting a stag, I asked him why. 'To shoot a stag you must find a stag, and this is not easy', he told me in his rough and ready English. 'The best way is to hear it cry. And when does it cry? When it is in love.' Herr Gassaver, I finally realised, was referring to the rutting season. Autumn is the time of year when stags lose their caution, come into the open and try to attract females with loud and desperate-sounding mating calls. My moral problem eased itself the moment I asked how much the fees would be. They vary, I found out, according to a complex formula of length, weight, size and shape applied not to the stag itself - the animal is not the final object of the hunt - but to its horns. What about the stag in the back of the truck, I asked. I tried to picture horns like that hanging on my dining room wall. About 180 points, Herr Gassaver suggested. That would cost something over Pounds 5,000 in trophy fees, which did not include 20 per cent VAT. In hunting as in most theatres of life, economics usually push moral considerations out of the picture. I retired to bed with my conscience clear; I would just watch the early morning hunt. I was woken at 3.30am and 30 minutes later was sitting in the back of a Toyota beside Asta, a prized red Bavarian bloodhound. In the front were Christian Kupfer - her master and the Alpenkur's head-hunting guide - and Didier Hugot, his client. Off we bounced through the forest on dirt roads, down the mountainside, along a narrow valley, then high up the opposite ridge. The weather was abysmal. As we drove through the dark our headlights cut through a steady fall of rain. Nevertheless, Didier Hugot, an extroverted company executive from Paris, was up-beat. Hunting, he told me, was no fun if it was too easy. The next few hours were not easy, but neither were they a lot of fun. We stopped the truck in a clearing and stepped out into cold rain. In the pitch black I could barely make out my companions beside me, much less the steep and heavily-wooded hillside. Christian allowed us not a single word, nor the smallest sliver of light. How he and Hugot climbed blind through a forest without making any noise mystified me. My own small achievement lay in smothering foul oaths - within five minutes I had banged into a tree, smacked my ankle against a rock, and nose-dived into a small and muddy stream. By the time we arrived, half-an-hour later, at a small hunting blind, I had begun to feel that the anti-hunting brigade was right: this was a cruel sport. And there we sat, waiting. The rain fell and the light lifted. Occasionally raising binoculars to their eyes, the two hunters kept their eyes roving over the dim grey space ahead. Asta dozed. My bottom was numb, my foot went to sleep. I dripped. Nobody spoke, nothing happened; 6 am came and went. There were no disconsolate mating calls, no love-lorn stags. Finally Christian had to admit defeat - rain was keeping the stags in the shelter of the forest. We trudged away. I felt disappointed. Didier Hugot, on the other hand, did not. There is much more to hunting, he told me, than the kill. He estimated that for every stag he has shot he has put in 30 hours of hill climbing, stalking, or just waiting. I asked him why he came such a long way to spend so much money for such hard-earned results. Was there no hunting in France? Of course there was, he replied. 'But hunting here has nothing to do with hunting at home. In France, especially the South, we blast anything that moves. It is complete anarchy.' In Austria it was different, Hugot said. Here, as in Germany and Switzerland, there was a discipline, a strong and much-cherished hunting tradition. Teutonic hunting culture dated from the Middle Ages when the hunting of 'high game' like deer, roebuck and chamois (as opposed to 'low game' such as hare and fowl) was the privilege of the wealthy land-owning class. Austrian society may be more democratic today, but noble hunting traditions persist. Every hunter subjects himself to a strict code of behaviour. He takes years to build the knowledge he needs to pass an Austrian hunting licence exam. 'Look how hunters in Austria dress', Hugot said, indicating his own cape and clothes. 'In everything they do there is a style and an attitude that gives value to hunting. This is what counts. I did not kill a stag today. What does it matter? It is the ambience, the ethic that is important. The final act, pulling the trigger, is almost irrelevant.' Didier Hugot had not displayed a blood-thirsty, smoking-barrel-and-spent-shot machismo. He had not come remotely close to shooting a stag. But he had thoroughly enjoyed himself. Even I, crashing about on the hillside and with no qualifications to wear tyrolean green, had enjoyed myself. Austrian hunting is an expensive, esoteric art in which the means seem to count as much as the ends. I did see one more stag before leaving Gosing, or at least part of one. I watched Christian Kupfer outside his forest chalet boiling a stag's head in a metal drum to remove its flesh before sawing away its frontal bone and horns. It was not a terribly pretty sight. Sometimes hunting is a cruel and barbaric practice. But I am more tempted now to believe it can also be a civilised sport.

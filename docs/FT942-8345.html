			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / International Capital Markets: DTB gives Globex vote of confidence DTB, Germany's financial futures exchange, said yesterday it intends to join Globex, the electronic futures trading system developed and operated by Reuters, the financial information and news group. DTB's decision gives a badly-needed vote of confidence to Globex, which has been rejected by two leading futures exchanges in the past month. On Tuesday, Liffe, the London futures and options exchange, decided against joining the system, blaming in part the terms which Globex had laid down. Last month, the Chicago Board of Trade said it was pulling out of Globex despite a new two-year agreement designed to give exchanges more flexibility. DTB is the third exchange to join Globex, along with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Matif, the French futures exchange. Ms Rosalyn Wilton, Reuters' managing director for transaction products, said an agreement between Globex and DTB would be signed 'quite soon' and that its products would be listed on the system shortly thereafter. DTB said one of the main attractions of joining Globex was the access it would provide to the US market. The most likely DTB products to be traded on Globex would be its futures contracts in five-year and 10-year German government bonds (bobls and bunds) and the corresponding options. Futures industry observers said that since DTB did not have after-hours trading, it should be able to mirror the success Matif has found on Globex. Matif closed down its after-hours trading system when it joined and its products now account for 80 per cent of volume on the system. 'Our decision forced an initial liquidity into the system because people had no choice,' said a Matif spokeswoman. However, most of Matif's volume on Globex is generated between 4pm and 9pm Paris time and there is virtually no trading during the night, she said. Cross-exchange trading has also failed to meet its goal, accounting for only 3 per cent of volume. DTB's hopes to increase volume in its contracts through Globex could be dashed by counter-moves at Liffe, which is keen to protect its 70 per cent share of the market in German government bond contracts. Mr Nick Durlacher, Liffe's chairman, said earlier this week that Liffe's after-pit trading could easily be extended by two hours, thus taking it to the end of the Chicago morning trading session which ends at 2pm Chicago time. Liffe may also extend its network overseas, following the successful installation of Liffe screens in New York.</p>

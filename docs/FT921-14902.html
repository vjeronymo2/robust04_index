			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont keeps option of tax cuts - Budget speculation MINISTERS signalled yesterday that the option of a tax-cutting pre-election Budget remained firmly open as the Labour party sought to maintain its attack on the government's management of the economy. As Mr Tom King, the defence secretary, switched the emphasis of Conservative campaigning to Labour's defence policy ahead of today's debate in the Commons, ministers dismissed reports that the shape of the Budget had already been decided. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has yet to take any firm decisions on the main measures that will be included. Instead he is understood to be ready to keep open until a week or so before the Budget the option of a cut in the basic rate of income tax or a large increase in tax thresholds. Mr Lamont's colleagues acknowledge strong pressure within the Conservative party for a Budget that highlights the sharp difference between the government and Labour's taxation policies. For many, that points to a 1p cut in the basic rate of tax to present the electorate with a stark choice in an April or May election. In spite of Labour's 5-point lead in the latest opinion poll, ministers believe that their attack over the past week on the opposition's plans for the 'biggest tax increase in peacetime history' has put Mr Neil Kinnock on the defen-sive. The chancellor is said to be instinctively in favour of a reduction in the basic rate as opposed to higher thresholds if the money can be found to reduce taxation. In the past, however, Mr John Major, the prime minister, has indicated that he prefers raising thresholds because of the help that gives to those on the lower end of the income scale. The final decision, however, will depend on the shape of the economy in the weeks immediately preceding the Budget. Ministers believe that if the recovery still looks weak, the pressure for tax cuts will be irresistible. If, however, there is much stronger evidence of an upturn as sterling stabilises, the chancellor will have to balance the possibility of lower taxes against the potential for a pre-election cut in interest rates. Labour meanwhile continued to insist that a tax-cutting Budget would provide further evidence of the Conservatives' 'boom-bust' approach to economic management. Speaking during one the regional tours that have marked the launch of the Labour election campaign, Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, repeated his party's call for a Budget for industry.</p>

			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THEATER COMPLAINTS  </P> <P> Mark Karen to be commended for his May 28 letter imploring moviegoers to assert  their rights when movies are out of focus, but I don't understand why Karen  himself didn't follow his own advice when he went to see "Field of Dreamsa."  Why did he sit through the entire movie without rushing to the manager to make  a complaint?  </P> <P> J. S. BOYD  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

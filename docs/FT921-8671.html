			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Piqued on the peaks: The off-piste financial problems at the Winter Olympics in Albertville A momentous first week of the Winter Olympics in Albertville ends today: records have been set and buckets of tears shed. The Games used to be dogged by political imbroglios; now commercial questions are causing off-piste problems. For the French the spectacle of a Winter Olympics on Gallic soil, or snow, has been greeted with characteristic panache. A son et lumiere Olympics symbol is projected on the Paris skyline every night. Newspapers are packed with pictures of bob-hatted French contestants and reports of every medal win, no matter how obscure the event. Whether citizens of the Savoie region, home of Albertville, will be quite so enthusiastic when they tot up the bill for hosting the event remains to be seen. 'Les jeux paieront les jeux' ('The games will pay for the games') was the catchphrase of Mr Michel Barnier, the ambitious young conservative politican who dreamed up the idea, together with Mr Jean-Claude Killy, France's triple gold medalist from the Grenoble winter Olympics. The organisers were confident that they could meet the original FFr2.9bn (Pounds 800m) bill through a combination of government subsidies, sponsorship and sales of television rights. Unfortunately for Mr Barnier and his fellow Savoyards, the final tally will be closer to FFr3.9bn. More than FFr1bn has been spent on equipment, double the budgeted amount. The bobsleigh run alone cost FFr220m, rather than FFr130m. At the same time less cash has rolled into the organisers' coffers than they hoped. The main problem has been the effect of exchange rate changes on the sale of television rights to the all-important US networks. The rights were sold in 1987, when there were FFr9 to the dollar. Now a dollar buys less than FFr5.5 and the organisers' insurance will not fully cover the shortfall. Nobody will know the real cost of the Albertville Games until the accounts are published in May or June. But observers believe the Games are heading for a loss of FFr250m to FFr500m. The critical question is: who will pay? The Savoyards have already started muttering that whoever does stump up the extra cash, it will not be them. The sponsors have already paid their share, and are too engrossed in their own business battles to pay much attention to the balance sheet of the Games as a whole. The most hard-fought contest concerns the use of the Olympics in marketing campaigns. It has pitted the Visa credit card company and the International Olympic Committee on one hand against American Express on the other. Visa, one of 12 official sponsors of both the winter and the summer games, is reported to have contributed some Dollars 20m of the total Dollars 170m sponsorship budget in The Olympic Programme (TOP) scheme. The scheme - set up by the International Olympic Committee at the 1988 games to amalgamate winter and summer sponsorship - is filled by multinationals such as Kodak, Matsushita, Coca-Cola and IBM. Amex was the official card sponsor of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, but declined to support the 1988 games. Visa stepped into the breach in 1988 and exercised its first refusal rights to sponsor this year's Games. The company has conducted a clever advertising campaign in the US, proudly proclaiming that only its credit card is worth carrying in Albertville - and implying that the Amex card would not be welcome. American Express has responded to this 'comparative' advertising blitz with its own commercials, which contain numerous references to the Olympics, all of which fall short of claiming any official sponsorship role. As a result, Mr Dick Pound, chairman of the IOC marketing commission, has vigorously attacked Amex for alleged 'ambush marketing': he believes Amex is undermining Visa's position as lead sponsor of the Olympics without paying a cent to towards the estimated Dollars 800m cost of staging the Winter Games. For its part, Amex argues that its advertising campaign is simply trying to redress Visa's alleged distortions - the implication that Amex cards are not welcome in the Albertville region. Ms Deborah Botwood, head of Visa's European public affairs operation, says Visa 'does not feel it is an Amex versus Visa issue, more an IOC and Amex affair; I wish we could forget all about this.' The IOC and American Express were, in fact, already embroiled in litigation before the Games even began. The committee recently sued Amex in France over alleged improper use of the Olympic symbol, the five interlinked rings. Last year an issue of Expressions, Amex's magazine for card-holders, ran an article about the Olympics, illustrated by Barcelona's summer games mascot, a cartoon dog called Cobi. Wherever Cobi goes, he carries with him the Olympic, five-ring symbol. Amex claims it had permission from the Spanish Olympic Committee, the national organising body, to use Cobi, but on February 4, a French court ruled against Amex and in favour of the IOC. At the same time, the court ruled in favour of Amex, against the IOC, on a related matter. Amex is currently giving to customers in the Savoie region, home to Albertville, a guide to the Games, using caricatures of skiers, skaters and so forth, which the IOC claimed were similar to caricatures it is using on official literature. The court decided the IOC's claim was groundless. Half-time score: IOC 1, Amex 1. Such litigation might seem to signify nothing more than a short-lived snowstorm on the slopes. But with the winter and summer Olympics combined now attracting something in the region of Dollars 1.84bn of total international sponsorship, it is easier to understand the sensitivity of all concerned. As Mr Pound put it: 'When the only thing you have to sell are the aspirations of youth and five rings, then misappropriation of intellectual property becomes a very serious matter.' Several observers believe that, in the long term, legal disputes and public mud-slinging between sponsors may inflict serious damage to international sport. Mr Ian Muir, chairman of the UK's Institute of Sports Sponsorship and Coca-Cola's UK manager for external affairs, said: 'If ambush marketing is allowed to continue then the major companies will look again at their sponsorship.' Such sentiments help to explain Mr Pound's anxieties and the IOC's determination to seek legal redress against companies that seek to imply a closer connection with the Olympics than they actually have. Any drop in sponsorship would also affect television advertising, since the biggest sponsors also tend to be the largest buyers of TV advertising space. According to Mr Pound, Albertville's TV ratings have been 'extraordinarily good.' CBS, the US network which has paid Dollars 243m for world coverage rights to the Winter Olympics, and is likely to spend another Dollars 100m in production costs, 'will not lose money', he said. In fact, CBS has been thrilled about its Albertville ratings. British-born network boss, Mr Howard Stringer, has been telephoning journalists to draw their attention to a 24 per cent audience share on the opening ceremony and a 33 per cent audience share on the dramatic men's downhill. Both figures were considerably ahead of rival network ABC's viewing figures for the Calgary Winter games in 1988. CBS declines to comment on the pricing of its advertising. Overall the network is showing a total of 116 hours' coverage with the main events shown in prime time, recorded if necessary. In the UK, with contestants destined to come in the lower 50s in the rankings, the Albertville Olympics have not exactly set the ratings alight. BBC figures are likely to show that it attracted between 6m and 7m viewers for the opening ceremony and slightly more than 4m for the men's downhill on BBC2 - up on Calgary, partly because the events are in European time. The Games should give BBC2 a brief respite in the ratings battle and take its audience share to about 13 per cent compared with the less than 9 per cent that it attracted the previous week. As the second and final week of the Winter Olympics gets under way, there is only a short breathing space for television networks to finalise their coverage plans for the Summer Olympics in Barcelona. And executives from the world's largest companies will no doubt be preparing for what could prove another gruelling sponsorship battle.</p>

			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Uncertainty hangs over vital defence side BRITISH Aerospace has become increasingly dependent on defence as the mainstay of its business but faces lingering uncertainties about crucial military programmes. First half results show its defence side as an island of profit in a sea of losses. Defence activities - embracing military aircraft, missiles and the Royal Ordnance munitions and land weapons business - produced earnings before interest of Pounds 296m, up Pounds 15m from the same period last year. The only other sector in the black was construction, with a Pounds 12m profit. Although BAe refuses to break down its figures, all the defence businesses are currently profitable, including the heavily restructured Dynamics division. But the real core is undoubtedly its military aircraft operation based at Warton in Lancashire, now facing unresolved questions affecting both its immediate and long-term future. BAe is counting on new orders from Saudi Arabia to keep its production of Tornado fighter-bombers at Warton going up to 1996. Tornado work on current Tornado orders has already virtually finished. Germany and Italy, the other partners have ended their programmes, and BAe has moved some work on its Hawk trainer aircraft to Warton in order to fill unused capacity. A long-awaited Saudi deal covering 48 more Tornados and a number of Hawk aircraft, together worth several billion pounds, is still pending. BAe is confident that the Saudis' requirement will not be affected by their planned purchase of F-15 aircraft from the US. But the Saudis are not averse to playing one supplier off against another, and it is unlikely the contract will be sealed before the F-15 deal has been cleared by the US Congress. Supplies to Saudi Arabia under a framework deal for which BAe is prime contractor are running at Pounds 2bn a year and are presumed to be the company's biggest single profit source. BAe said a new contract should be signed by the end of the year. But then it was saying the same this time last year. Tornado production is due to be replaced after 1996 by the European Fighter Aircraft, currently under question after Germany's rejection of the four-nation jet and its proposal to launch a less ambitious project. Spain and Italy, the other partners could also drop out of the project as currently conceived. Mr Dick Evans, BAe's chief executive, says the group still aims at a collaborative project, but maintains that it would be 'perfectly feasible' for the UK to produce the aircraft on its own. This, he says would save up to 30 per cent on the cost of collaborative production, and would bring the full export benefits to the UK. BAe and GEC  -the other main British company with a heavy stake in EFA - are both considering the possibility of acting as risk-taking managers of the project on behalf of the UK government. However, possible options for the future of the project will not become clear until the completion of studies by the four governments and industrial partners next month. Also in question is the future of BAe's missile division, where employment has been reduced by two-thirds in the last three years to 5,300. Restructuring in the US - particularly the recent acquisition of General Dynamics' missile operations by Hughes Aircraft - has increased pressure for reorganising the business in Europe to enable it to compete in the world market. Plans to merge BAe's guided weapons' interests with those of Thomson-CSF of France collapsed early last year. Matra of France has recently been in discussions on the future of the BAe division, seeking a link-up between prime contractors which might also eventually embrace the French state-controlled company Aerospatiale. GEC might also be involved in a joint missile venture</p>

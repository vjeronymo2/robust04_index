			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> CASUALTIES OF AN ILL WIND;  </P> <P> TEACHERS WHO BLAME REFINERY FOR SICKENING INCIDENT ORGANIZE A PRESSURE GROUP  </P> <P> Gertrude Delaney has not been in class for two months.  </P> <P> Her daily routine as a special education teacher helping students to overcome  learning disabilities has been replaced by a more painful and personal  struggle.  </P> <P> Now, instead of seeing students, she sees doctors.  </P> <P> Delaney, her teaching assistant, and eight students at Magruder Middle School  in Torrance were hospitalized March 8 after being felled by fumes believed to  have come from the nearby Mobil Oil refinery.  </P> <P> Although the precise source of the fumes has never been identified, the  experience of teachers and students at Magruder has focused attention on the  potential health effects of exposure to toxic chemicals from the refinery.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rotten-Egg Odor  </P> <P> Teachers at Magruder have organized a group to press for the elimination of  toxics and to demand that Mobil provide information about the health effects of  exposure to what is widely believed to have been hydrogen sulfide. The chemical  forms a toxic gas that has a characteristic rotten-egg odor.  </P> <P> Mobil has not accepted responsibility for the fumes but has paid the medical  bills of those injured.  </P> <P> In case of another episode, teachers have asked to have oxygen on hand at the  school on 185th Street, a quarter of a mile northwest of the sprawling  refinery.  </P> <P> Children playing outside Magruder's buff-colored buildings were the first to  complain on that March morning.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shooting Pains  </P> <P> "I heard children say: 'What's that smell? What's that smell?' " Delaney  recalled last week. "I was so used to having odors from that refinery . . .  that I just ignored it."  </P> <P> Moments later, Delaney said she noticed an acid-like smell. "I started having  pain in my throat. As it got worse, it went straight through my body, up my jaw  and down my arms," she said. "I was getting more and more panicky. I couldn't  breathe, the pain was so severe."  </P> <P> Her teaching assistant, Lorie Ustick, also began having difficulty breathing.  </P> <P> Ustick said she too smelled an acidic odor. Tears started running down her  face. She felt as if her sinuses were on fire, that there was fire down her  throat and burning in her chest.  </P> <P> Special education teacher Kathryn Brooks, whose classroom next door to  Delaney's also faces south toward the refinery, described the odor as a very  strong rotten-egg smell.  </P> <P> "The doors and windows were open. It just blew right in," Brooks said. "It  continued to get worse and worse until you could not draw a breath. It felt  like you were suffocating."  </P> <P> Principal Sidney Morrison said the odor was so powerful that he doubled over as  soon as he opened his office door. "It was almost burning in its intensity. It  was the worst kind of rotten egg (smell) you can imagine."  </P> <P> Delaney, 54, of Torrance developed a case of what her doctors called chemical  bronchitis.  </P> <P> She went back to school March 28. But on April 12, Delaney said she smelled the  "very same smell that I smelled the first time."  </P> <P> A spokesman for the South Coast Air Quality Management District said the agency  received three complaints of a bad smell on that day.  </P> <P> Again, Delaney said, she suffered chest pains, hoarseness and a second case of  chemical bronchitis.  </P> <P> "The second exposure was extremely traumatic to me. I could not stay at school  any longer. I cannot go back to that school," Delaney said. "I cannot go  through that again. I could be dead."  </P> <P> Delaney has not taught at Magruder since then. She filed a worker's  compensation claim with the school district and, after 12 years at Magruder, is  being transferred to another school farther from the refinery.  </P> <P> She and Ustick are considering a lawsuit against Mobil alleging that they  suffered long-term health damage.  </P> <P> During an interview in their attorney's Manhattan Beach office, Delaney said  she is "not feeling very well emotionally or physically."  </P> <P> And Ustick, 35, of Redondo Beach broke down in tears while recalling the  incident. Both women said they have suffered memory loss and disorientation.  </P> <P> Brooks said she also suffered from chemical bronchitis that her doctor has told  her was caused by overexposure to hydrogen sulfide. The 40-year-old teacher  consulted an industrial toxicologist who said her lungs could remain inflamed  for up to a year.  </P> <P> The fumes they inhaled have heightened concern among faculty members at the  school, which ironically bears the name of Philip Magruder, a former Mobil  official.  </P> <P> "There are teachers who have been here for many years that have grave concerns  about the safety of themselves and the students," Morrison said. "The incident  itself has reminded people of a clear and present danger. . . . When you see  kids getting carried away, you know there is a danger over there."  </P> <P> The incident was the second involving Mobil and Magruder in four months.  </P> <P> In December, thousands of pieces of fiberglass insulation blew off a storage  tank at the refinery and across the schoolyard. Students were kept inside while  the material was cleaned up.  </P> <P> After the March incident, teachers organized a group -- Faculty United at  Magruder for the Elimination of toxic Substances -- nicknamed FUMES.  </P> <P> "We believe that Mobil Oil Refinery in Torrance is responsible," the teachers  wrote in a petition to the Torrance Teachers Assn. and to the school board.  "Although Mobil has not admitted responsibility, they are 'footing' the bill  for medical treatment."  </P> <P> The organization is supporting the city of Torrance's lawsuit seeking to have  the refinery declared a public nuisance. The teachers also urged the Torrance  Unified School District board to go on record in favor of the lawsuit.  </P> <P> The teachers said they are "deeply concerned about our health and safety not  just for the present, but for the future as well."  </P> <P> The city's lawsuit alleges that teachers and students at Magruder suffered  headaches, nausea and chest pains as a result of a noxious odor and fumes from  the refinery.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Odds 'Good' It Was Mobil  </P> <P> Torrance Fire Chief Scott Adams said Mobil was the likely source of the  problem. "The odds are good that it was Mobil and the odds are also good that  it was hydrogen sulfide," he said.  </P> <P> While paramedics worked on the injured students and teachers, an inspector from  the South Coast Air Quality Management District tried unsuccessfully to locate  the source of the odor.  </P> <P> After inspecting the refinery during four days after the incident, AQMD  officials cited Mobil for three violations of air quality laws. The violations  were for two separate releases of excessive smoke from flares that burn off gas  and for not having a gas flow monitor in operation on a flare.  </P> <P> AQMD spokesman Bill Kelly said the flares could have emitted hydrogen sulfide.  Mobil is contesting those citations.  </P> <P> Mobil did agree last month to pay a $5,000 fine for another violation involving  failure to have properly certified pollution monitoring equipment in operation  on a new sulfur plant at the refinery.  </P> <P> Mobil's environmental manager, Greg Munakata, said the refinery agreed to pay  the fine to the AQMD although Mobil had asked for an extension of time from the  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to meet the monitoring requirement.  </P> <P> In its lawsuit, Torrance contends that individuals living and working near the  refinery are suffering short- and long-term health problems, including  respiratory disease, heart disease, cancer and genetic damage because of toxic  air pollution from the refinery.  </P> <P> </P> <P> City Allegations  </P> <P> The city alleges that short-term exposure to hydrogen sulfide may be lethal and  poses an immediate danger to health, causing severe eye and respiratory tract  irritation and a loss of one's sense of smell.  </P> <P> Mobil denies Torrance's allegations and has begun preparing its legal defenses.  </P> <P> Jim Carbonetti, spokesman for Mobil, said refinery personnel have never been  able to determine the source of the odor at Magruder, although they believe  that it was hydrogen sulfide. "We couldn't find any evidence of a leak," he  said.  </P> <P> Asked why Mobil assumed responsibility for the medical bills of teachers and  students, Carbonetti replied: "The wind was blowing from the direction of the  refinery. The odor was a hydrogen sulfide odor. . . . The circumstances just  dictated that we assume the responsibility for taking care of the people who  were involved."  </P> <P> But he stressed that "we haven't been able to pinpoint it to an exact cause."  </P> <P> Morrison said Magruder's faculty is not satisfied with Mobil's inability to  explain what happened that morning.  </P> <P> "We're still in the dark. No one knows why it happened, but it did happen and  there were consequences," he said. "If you don't know why it happened, then it  could happen again at any time."  </P> <P> Morrison said teachers are concerned about lingering health effects from  exposure to hydrogen sulfide. They asked Mobil to pay for independent medical  tests to assure that there was no long-term damage.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Assurances Asked  </P> <P> After the Magruder incident, PTAs at that school and others in north Torrance  wrote Mobil to express concern and ask for specific assurances about the safety  of teachers and students.  </P> <P> Mobil has invited Morrison and members of the Torrance Council of PTAs to  attend a question-and-answer session and tour of the refinery this weekend.  </P> <P> The dialogue between Mobil and Magruder comes too late for Delaney.  </P> <P> Morrison said Delaney's departure from the Magruder family is a real loss.  </P> <P> "For her to have to leave here has been a devastating experience for her. She  feels a real sense of loss leaving Magruder," he said. "I feel a real sense of  loss too. It should not have had to happen this way."  </P></p>

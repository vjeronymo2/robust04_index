			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / A new direction for Rumbelows: The high street retailer's change of role Since he became chief executive of Thorn EMI five years ago, Mr Colin Southgate has been steadily dismantling the empire built up by Sir Jules Thorn, the group's immigrant founder. Yesterday's announcement that the Rumbelows electrical retailing business is to be converted into an appliance rental operation represents a further retreat from the older, highly-diversified Thorn towards Mr Southgate's vision of a company focusing on two primary businesses: music and the renting out of appliances from television sets to washing machines. In doing so, he is leaving a business in which Thorn had failed to make an impact and seeking to capitalise on the group's leadership in the UK and international appliance rental market. The move will also provide a significant expansion in the market for consumer products rental. Employees at Rumbelows, Thorn's electrical retailing chain, have had to live for at least three years with the knowledge that Mr Southgate was desperate to sell the business. Yesterday he acknowledged that he was unlikely to find a buyer and finally decided to act. Mr Southgate had previously sold Ferguson, the last significant UK-owned maker of television sets, to Thomson of France in 1987. After a protracted search for a buyer, Thorn's light manufacturing division, the Austrian-born Sir Jules's first business, was sold to General Electric of the US in 1990. Rumbelows, according to Mr Southgate, was made up of 'about 45 businesses that Jules acquired in many different ways. Some came to him as payments for debts'. Rumbelows has found it impossible to compete with larger rivals such as Comet, Dixons and Currys. Competition is likely to intensify as regional electricity companies expand their retailing interests. With Rumbelows accounting for only 6 per cent of the UK market and with losses of Pounds 16m last year, Mr Southgate yesterday declared: 'Enough's enough, really.' Rumbelows' head office in Waltham Cross will close, along with the company's service organisation. Existing Rumbelow service contracts will be fulfilled by employees of the Thorn rental business. Initially, 800 Rumbelows jobs will go from a workforce of 4,000. Mr Southgate believes he will have little trouble selling Rumbelows' 45 out-of-town sites. He says fax messages from interested buyers started arriving yesterday morning. The remaining 450 shops high street shops will be reduced to 250 over the next two years. The remaining business will still be called Rumbelows for the time being, but Thorn plans to turn them into rental outlets. They will be different, however, from the existing 1,000 rental outlets which trade under the Radio Rentals, Multibroadcast and DER names. The Rumbelows operation will offer customers an eventual right to buy appliances - something not available at the existing UK outlets but common in the 19 other countries in which Thorn has rental businesses. Rumbelows will also be slightly more down-market than the other UK rental shops and will, for example, rent out used equipment. Rental is big business for Thorn, accounting for 27.5 per cent of 1991 turnover of Pounds 3.7bn. Although rental profits fell from Pounds 185.6m in 1990 to Pounds 138m last year, the division remained Thorn's biggest earner. In the UK alone, Thorn currently has 3.5m pieces of equipment out on rent. Rental, Mr Southgate says, appeals to different types of people in the different regions in which Thorn operates. In the US, where Thorn has 1,000 Rent-a-Center outlets, rental is more of a blue collar habit than in Europe. In northern Europe, Thorn's rental customers tend to be young couples with children. They want expensive television sets or washing machines but cannot afford to buy them outright. In the UK, almost all Thorn's rental business is of consumer electronic rather than kitchen appliances. UK rental appeals to a wide range of customers from impecunious students to pensioners. The latter are often afraid of appliances breaking down or of not being able to operate them and like the quick service visits available from rental companies. The biggest boost to appliance rental in the UK, however, is the appearance of new technologies, particularly if there are rival standards. When the video cassette recorder first appeared, many consumers sensibly rented VCRs rather than buying them until the standards showdown between VHS and Betamax had been settled. Thorn had hoped that the satellite television battle between Sky Television and British Sky Broadcasting - using different, incompatible systems - would result in a similar rental bonanza. The merger of the two organisations into British Sky Broadcasting, using the Sky standard, meant that viewers were less afraid to buy their equipment. Mr Southgate concedes that there are no new technologies in the offing that might tempt confused consumers to rent rather than buy, although he has some hopes for wide-screen and high definition television. Although some consumers might consider renting a better alternative to buying during a recession, the drop in Thorn's rental profits last year demonstrates that the business is not immune to a downturn. Thorn's experience is that during a recession customers tend to hold on to the appliance they have rather than returning it and renting a more expensive and up-to-date one. In the US last year, recession-hit retailers cut the sales price of electrical goods, damaging rental income. Nevertheless, the US side of the business produced a 25 per cent increase in dollar profit. As the world's largest rental company, Thorn is more confident of its ability to compete in this sector than in the cut-throat world of electrical retailing. The City approved of the decision to get out of electrical retailing, boosting Thorn's shares by 15p yesterday to 841p. Whether Mr Southgate has been successful in building a healthy and viable company to replace the group that Sir Jules Thorn built will require longer consideration. Mr Southgate contends that many of the original Thorn businesses were too small and UK-based to compete internationally. Had he been able to turn companies such as Ferguson into world beaters, he would have been regarded as one of the UK's most successful industrialists. That he sold the companies instead is not necessarily to his discredit. Thomson has suffered heavy losses with Ferguson and has closed all its UK research and manufacturing facilities. Someone else might have made a success of Thorn's electrical retailing. But the fact that no one wanted to buy Rumbelows probably speaks for itself.</p>

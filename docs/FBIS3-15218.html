			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich at Belarusian </F> Supreme Soviet session in Minsk, on 1 March -- recorded]    [Text] Esteemed people's deputies! At Supreme Soviet's  request, the government has drafted proposals regarding changes  within the structure of the Council of Ministers and local  executive bodies. In my report I would like to both  substantiate these proposals and inform you about the  government's standpoint on a number of conceptual problems,  typical for the transitional period of the state-building  process in the Republic. Certain circumstances that are vital  for choosing further ways of developing our state demand a more  detailed analysis.    First: We are standing at a historic crossroads; there is no  way back, but neither have we definitely chosen a new path.  Speaking about the crossroads in a simplified way, Belarus has  to choose its foreign policy orientation between East and West,  North and South. Some politicians have been trying to treat this  issue rather inflexibly. In the economy, [we should choose]  between unrestrained market romanticism with all its deadly  consequences and social security for the people; between the  [?ruining] of the industrial and agricultural potential and the  course of gradual reform directed at building a state with  controlled socially oriented market relations. These are the  two primary spheres that cause a division of approaches  determining the fate of our people and our state.    Second: In the sphere of strengthening statehood, stability,  and accord in society, there also exist two diametrically  different approaches. One approach provides for the destruction  of the current basis of the Republic's constitutional structure  -- that is, the elimination of the institute of soviets of  people's deputies, the adoption of a law on lustration and its  introduction into political life. This would amount to a ban on  the activities of the left and (?other) parties. Strange as it  might seem, there are attempts to politicize the history of the  Belarusian nation and to plant Russophobia in the social  mentality.    The other approach is based on common sense and is advocated  by the Supreme Soviet, the government, and an overwhelming  majority of our people. It envisions building a democratic  state of law and a priority nature of an individual. This kind  of state would rule out violence against an individual; and the  ideas of national self-awareness would begin to dominate in  society, based on historic truth and in concurrence with the  political course pursued by the administration and the  expectations of a majority of people. I think that nobody will  negate the fact that since the Republic won independence and the  CIS was formed, the government had to resolve a number of  various complicated problems. It was necessary to reduce social  losses to a maximum, and safeguard [word indistinct],  humanitarian, and moral aspects of reform, as well as the  balance between the interests of the Belarusian people and those  of other CIS citizens and the world community.    This is why we have advocated and will continue to advocate  the policy of sober step-by-step reform directed not against,  but for the benefit of society. Events and developments in  other newly independent states, primarily in Russia, have  affected the rate of changes carried out in our country. Both  [word indistinct] and Russians are concerned over the problems  of civil peace and national accord. We understand perfectly  well that if Russia abandons the policy of integration with CIS  states, this would inevitably produce political and economic  cataclysms in both the Commonwealth states and in Russia. Not  only Belarus is aware of threats to civil peace. That is why our  ideas to form an economic union and a single financial system  have finally become the subject of serious negotiations with the  Russian Government, have attracted the attention of other  independent states, and have been supported in a recent address  by the president of the Russian Federation. It is pleasant to  point out that within the framework of the CIS, alienation,  economic disintegration, and so-called communal sovereignty are  being gradually but ever more steadily replaced with trust,  understanding of common geopolitical interests, and a necessity  to coordinate industrial and agricultural policies, credit and  monetary relations, banking, investment, and finance.    Relations with the Russian Federation are undoubtedly the  main foreign policy priority for Belarus. This is a  well-founded historic choice. It has no alternates because of  the community of Russian and Belarusian cultures, the common  interests of these fraternal nations, close integration, and  former nearness of their industrial potentials and communication  space.    Addressing those who criticize the foreign policy of the  Belarusian Government, I would like to underline once again that  Belarus is ardently following the road of reform and building a  democratic society, and a sovereign state of law, open for  dialogue with all friendly nations.    I am sure that we understand the importance of the historic  moment experienced by the Republic and cannot tolerate the  situation in which nationalism and extremism would prevail over  wisdom, and individual rights and freedoms would depend on  ethnic origin.    Political monopoly of a separate party acting as a prophet  on  behalf of the entire nation, is inadmissible. In recent years,  our society has received a perfect political education and has a  good understanding of rhetorics. People do not want political  fuss and promises; they want real improvement of their lives,  justice, and protection against growing crime. Strong state  power enjoying people's trust is the main condition for leading  the Republic out of an economic crisis. We have had a chance to  see for ourselves that in the period of structural reshaping,  the state must not fail to control the economic development.    [Words indistinct] that in our Republic, where the  overwhelming majority of enterprises and almost the entire  agricultural complex are state-run, rapid reform can be  spontaneous and not supervised by the state. Control over this  complicated process is probably the main condition for a gradual  transition to market relations. Proceeding from what I have  said, the government believes that the economic situation is  complicated. However, our current hardships are to a great  extent a result of the high degree of dependence on external  factors, and can be attributed to the transition to a new-type  economy.    There is a way out of the current situation. The fact that  the government has not lost control over finance and economy,  and has prevented a disastrous decline in production and a  destruction of industries and agriculture, gives ground for  optimism. Working at the brink of its financial potential, the  government has managed to maintain a social security system.    As for implementing reforms this year, we believe the  following tasks should be undertaken. One should accelerate  privatization of small businesses. We are planning to privatize  about 50 percent of the enterprises operating in trade and  services; to transform about 50 percent of large state-run  enterprises into joint stock companies; to hasten work on  finishing building of uncompleted facilities. One should also  pursue active antimonopoly policies intended to reveal natural  and artificial monopolies, their division, and the control over  price monopolism. [The government should] support private  initiative by removing bureaucratic obstacles and their  discriminating policies. The private sector should be developed  in the quickest way possible to compensate for the inevitably  shrinking production in the state sector, to increase the  efficiency of the economy, and to provide jobs for the  unemployed labor force. In addition, industries must be  prepared to manufacture only those products for which there is a  demand.    One of the problems that raises the concern of the entire  society is economic crimes and corruption. The criminal world  is becoming more professional and equipped with modern types of  weapons. One cannot help but see that in some CIS countries,  organized crime poses an immense threat to their national  security and to the course of reforms. In spite of all our  mistakes in this extremely sensitive area, let me remind that  the government declared combating organized crime as one of its  priorities, and toughened measures to counter this evil. First  of all, I am talking about the resolutions issued on 24  September and 25 November 1992. At that time, it was an  excessive measure, but the government was supported by society  and, importantly, by you, esteemed deputies. We appreciate your  support and the fact that later on, the government policies  found their reflection in laws that you adopted. Also to this  end, was government resolution No. 711 curtailing circulation of  foreign currencies. This displayed an understanding that the  unrestrained circulation of different currencies inflicts  substantial damages on the Republic.    The crime-ridden situation in the Republic calls for a  reform  of our law enforcement system, in the first place, the Internal  Affairs Ministry and the KGB. It is important that their  functions be divided to avoid duplication. At the same time, I  am confident that the Internal Affairs Ministry and the KGB  should definitely be part of the executive branch, providing  implementation of the main task -- security of the state and the  protection of its sovereignty and citizens' rights. Combating  crime must be an integrated and uncompromising process. In  conjunction with other interested parties, the Cabinet of  Ministers is completing the preparation of the state program  providing for urgent anticrime measures. These measures will  allow to substantially increase the efficiency of all law  enforcement agencies. The Cabinet of Ministers was given this  task yesterday at the Security Council meeting, which will then  be examined by the Cabinet of Ministers Presidium and later by  the Supreme Soviet Presidium. There is no denying that [words  indistinct] tasks [words indistinct] improve the structure of  law enforcement agencies as well. However, this is not the most  important issue. The key task is to ensure firm governing of  the state, strict executive discipline, and unconditional  execution of all decisions by government institutions. For this  purpose, one should reform power in accordance with [word  indistinct] and the objectives, clearly define the scope of  competence of power branches, and ensure their genuine  independence within legal constrains. Anyone, regardless of  position, who violates the law and oversteps legal limits must  be held responsible for his actions. This task should be central  to the entire judicial and law enforcement system.    The fundamental issue raising heated debates in our  parliament is the issue concerning the structure of government  institutions. The government resolutely stands for introducing  the post of president being the head of state and the executive  branch. Unfounded are the fears of those who think that this  move could lead to a usurpation of power and dictatorship. To  avoid this, the draft constitution includes, to my mind, quite  an effective system of restrains and counterbalances. It is  based on the system of division of legislative, executive, and  judicial powers widely accepted throughout the world. Besides,  one should not forget that our people experienced dramatic  changes in social consciousness over the past years. The  people's mentality has changed, and their political activity has  increased. Today, we have a pretty high degree of freedom,  including political freedom. In my opinion, it is the free  people in a democratic and law-governed state that are the  guarantor preventing the usurpation of power. The legislative  branch should, of course, counterbalance a strong executive  branch and independent judicial power. I believe that the new  constitution provides for a balance among all these branches.  In a bid to make their relations more stable, the authors of  the draft proposed that the prime minister, along with his  deputies, power ministers, and the president, be appointed and  discharged by the Supreme Soviet. Thus, the draft gives the  Supreme Soviet control over the government and makes the  president accountable to it.    The relationship between people and power are the most  important in the process of the political and economic reforms  which are still under way, even though our opponents claim  otherwise. The law on self-government and local economies  passed in February 1991 affects, in the most direct way, the  rights of citizens, because in their everyday life they have to  deal with local authorities, and not the parliament or  government. So they care what those authorities should be like,  what powers they will have, and to what extent they, the  citizens, can influence their decisions. The law has been  passed but we already see its faultiness and isolation from the  federal system of transformation. This law does not ensure the  balance of executive power institutions. This task remains  beyond the competence of the Cabinet of Ministers. However, we  consider it important to present our point of view. Laws and  decisions adopted by the parliament and government are not only  often ignored in the hinterland, but meet with hidden and  sometimes open resistance. This is caused, first of all, by the  lack of a clear system of subordination in the government  institutions, vagueness of competence given to executive bodies,  and lack of coordination among executive and legislative bodies.  Thus we need a fundamental restructuring of local executive  power to define the competence of local governments, ensuring  more responsibility of government officials for state discipline.    What will these representatives of the authorities be  called:  local soviets, or perhaps some other name? This makes no  difference. But there can be some difference. Nevertheless,  the local soviets should not perform the functions of local  parliaments, that is, the legislative organs which go against  the laws of a single unitary state. Life itself shows [words  indistinct] which should be changed, should be changed. These  are, primarily, the following: the adoption of economic  programs and budgets; the establishment of a system of local  taxation which should correspond to the law; the granting of tax  breaks that are being collected by local budgets; the legal use  of natural resources; protection of the environment; the regular  election of judges, and an entire range of other issues. At the  same time, it makes sense to preserve the soviets or other  organs at the level of oblasts, cities, rayons -- except city  rayons -- while in the city rayons, workmen's settlements, and  rural settlements there should only be the organs of executive  power. It is necessary, in our opinion, to promptly reduce the  staff of the representative bodies. To strengthen the management  potential of the entire executive branch, we think it necessary  to elect the chairmen of the local soviets -- who will  simultaneously be chairmen of the executive committees -- to  carry out the recommendation of the chiefs of the higher organs  of the executive branch. By the way, the city executive  committees are entitled to choose candidates to run in the  elections for chairmen of oblast soviets. The same procedure  should be implemented when the chairmen of the oblast soviets  are dismissed from their posts. The responsibility of local  soviets, especially in the sphere of municipal property, should  be streamlined. We have many examples when local soviets, due  to their specific activities, have stalled privatization and  even the programs of privatization have been adopted with  considerable delays from the established terms. We believe that  the constitution should highlight the main things concerning  local administration and self-administration, while the  competence [words indistinct] and the activity of organs of  local self-administration should be determined by a special law.    Let me now move on to the proposal to upgrade the structure  of the Cabinet of Ministers and its organization. Despite the  fact that the government has been empowered with specific powers  in this sphere, I am grateful to the Supreme Soviet for the  understanding of the acute character of the situation. I  consider it my duty to inform the Supreme Soviet deputies on the  essence of the reorganization which is being carried out.  Because we are living through a transition period, we should be  aware that the organization of the state power organs cannot  immediately receive a proper form. While our statehood is  being developed and we are coming closer to the market, there  arises the need to set up new organs of power and eliminate old,  obsolete ones.    Reforming the system of executive power is very important  and is the main direction in our policy in the realm of state  building. The organization of the Cabinet of Ministers, which  was formed by the Supreme Soviet in the summer of 1990, has  already undergone some changes. In the past, the Light, Local,  and Timber Ministries, the Ministries of Municipal Services,  Land Improvement and Water Resources, Construction and  Installation and Special Building Works -- that is, seven  ministries -- were liquidated. Many functions of these  ministries were taken over by independent economic entities --  concerns and associations. In my opinion, two new concerns will  be set up on the basis of the Ministry of Industry and Building  Materials [as heard] and the Ministry of Building and  Exploitation of Motorways. These considerable changes have  greatly expanded the functions of some former ministries and  departments. This allowed republican and local authorities to  adapt to modern conditions. Though this organization has  somewhat increased, it does not look as cumbersome as it has in  the past. Its staff does not exceed 1.3 percent of the total  number of people employed in the national economy, while in  Lithuania this percentage is 1.8 and in Ukraine -- 1.4. In  fact, in 1993, costs for the maintenance of state bodies in the  framework of the overall republican budget stood at 1.21  percent, compared to the 1.31 percent predicted in the budget.    The main purpose of reform in the sphere of management is to  completely avoid direct administrative centralized pressure on  the various domains of economy, to provide opportunities for  economic entities to act independently, in other words, to  create a qualitatively new system of administration on the basis  of global norms. Simultaneously, our task is to preserve state  regulation of state property. In the Republic's administrative  system, the central place should be given to a ministry. The  ministry should actively pursue the government's policy in  various spheres and have the widest-possible powers. The  ministry should be relieved of operative-administrative  functions as much as possible. The number of ministries should  not be large, but it should allow for an entire range of issues  to be implemented on the macro level.    In this regard, it is necessary to strengthen the state  administration, to extend the functions of the ministries, and  to adopt normative acts. Therefore, the government has already  considerably extended the powers of the ministries and  departments, has empowered them with greater responsibility in  the upgrading of the organization of the central bodies, the  management of property, and the setting up of specific funds at  the expense of budget and non-budget sources of financing, as  well as the development of new forms of employment.    I will not speak in detail on the proposed changes. I will  only specify the most important ones. First of all, it goes  about the restructuring of the State Economic Planning  Commission and the Ministry of Finance. This is not only a  change of title or that we take cognizance of the fashion.  [sentence as heard] The problem is that the present status of  this department does not correspond to its tasks, does not allow  for concentration on the development of nationwide economic  programs, to forecast the most important economic processes, and  to implement market reforms. In other words, it should become a  regulator of the Republic's economic life. The organization and  the functioning of this ministry should perform a dual task: On  the one hand, it should provide for the management of the entire  economic complex, and on the other hand, it should develop  economic policy on the path to market reform. To implement this  idea, we are planning to set up an independent center of  economic reforms within the Ministry of Finance. Economic  researchers, managers of enterprises, entrepreneurs, and  representatives of other interested parties will participate in  the work of this center.    Taking into consideration the increase in control over  energy  resources and the need to concentrate the administration in this  sphere in one specific department, we deem it necessary to set  up a Ministry of Fuel and Energy on the basis of the Ministry of  Energy and the Committee for Energy within the Cabinet of  Ministers. Thus, all of the complex issues related to energy  and fuel deliveries will be coordinated by one governmental  body. We deem it necessary to reform the State Committee for  Foreign Economic Relations into a corresponding ministry. The  increased functions of this foreign economic committee demand  that the issue of its status be adequately resolved. This  ministry could become one of the key ministries in the sphere of  foreign economic relations. It should take into consideration  the importance of attracting hard currency and investments to  the Republic.    To strengthen the power of the Ministry of Finance over the  nation's entire financial system, the functions of some state  bodies, including the State Inspectorate of Valuables, the State  Inspectorate for Insurances [Gosstrakhnadzor], and the State  Committee for Minting [Gozznak] are being put under its  jurisdiction. The setting up of a state treasury within the  Ministry of Finance, to concentrate all the budget means and  state non-budget funds, is very important. According to the  decision of the Supreme Soviet, the State Committee for State  Property is being reformed into the Ministry for State Property  and Privatization; the State Committee for Ecology -- to the  Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection, with  the Department for Protection of Fish on the basis of the Chief  Department for Protection and Reproduction of Fish and Control  Over Fishing within the Cabinet of Ministers. After the  liquidation of the Ministry of Resources, a shareholding  association is being set up on its basis. The functions of the  Ministry of Grain Products, which is also liquidated, will be  performed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Foodstuffs.    A Ministry of Culture and Publishing is being set up on the  basis of the Ministry of Information and the Ministry of  Culture. The National State Television and Radio Company is  being reformed into the State Committee for Television and  Radio. The Committee for Social Protection of Servicemen is  being liquidated and its functions will be performed by the  Ministry of Culture and Publishing, the State Committee for  Labor, and the Defense Ministry. We are planning to set up a  Committee for Science and Technology which will be charged with  providing for the scientific grounding of economic reforms. In  general, we are planning to eliminate 13 ministries and  departments. This is almost one fourth of the present number.  It is planned to reduce the staff of the central organs of the  ministries and departments by 12 percent, or by 800 people.  This all represents a savings of 1.5 billion rubles [R] -- in  the terms of yearly salaries -- in December 1993 prices.    Now I will say some words about the government bodies.  Changes in the organization of the state administration  naturally lead to a reorganization of government bodies. In  connection with this, the functions of [words indistinct] and  departments become considerably limited and are primarily handed  over to the ministries which have independence in the management  of their branches. In accordance to the new approaches and  independence, which the ministries will receive, a number of  branch departments and sections are being liquidated within the  organization of the government bodies. Simultaneously, other  bodies will be set up. A Council of Independent Experts will be  set up within the Office of the Chairman of the Cabinet of  Ministers. By the way, this opinion is being supported by the  Confederation of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. In my  opinion, this will allow for deeper analysis of the  socioeconomic situation, and the government will be able to  adopt prompt and precise decisions.    New positions corresponding to the new tasks are being  introduced, and the role and responsibility of advisers is being  increased. The government's press service will be, or, to be  more exact, has already been reformed: Today the decree on the  government's press service was signed. In general, the staff of  the Cabinet of Ministers is being reduced by 10 percent, which  represents a savings -- in the terms of yearly salaries -- of  R100 million in December 1993 prices. The staff of government  bodies will be reduced by one third and will stand at -- I ask  you to listen closely to this figure -- some 200 people. I am  sure that the reorganization of the bodies of the Cabinet of  Ministers will bring new, fresh staff, highly professional and  honest people to the new organs. We hope that the  implementation of the Law on Service in the state bodies --  effective 1 March 1994 -- will also serve this aim. As for the  reduction of staff in oblast, city, and other Soviets, the  Supreme Soviet has charged the government with resolving this  issue. However, under current legislation, the Cabinet of  Ministers has no adequate powers to unify and reduce their  staff. Currently, we have a situation whereby, for example, the  staff in one oblast executive committee has 150 people more than  another. In this connection, the Cabinet of Ministers proposes  to discuss this issue either at the Supreme Soviet session or at  the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, and to develop a unified  organization of local authorities on the condition that their  staff is reduced by 12-15 percent.    Esteemed People's Deputies! I tried to briefly relay the  stance of the government on the main issues of the life and  activity of our state. I hope that our approach will find  mutual understanding among the majority of those who are present  here and, as a result, decisions will be adopted which will  allow you to more decisively and efficiently build our state,  reform the organs of power and administrative, and create a  socially oriented market economy.    Today, we are living through difficult times. However, we  should not dramatize the situation too much. We have the most  important and meaningful assets: extremely laborious people and  an intelligentsia which is educated, highly intellectual,  scientific, and creative. We have definite and noble aims: the  creation of a decent standard of living for the Belarusian  people, the striving to lead the Republic to well-being and  flourishing. To realize these aims, the government will be  resolute and uncompromising. Thank you.</p>

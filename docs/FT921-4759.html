			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Dow obeys the law of supply and demand  -Wall Street WHATEVER the flaws in the science of economics, it is hard to fault the laws of supply and demand. If a lot of people want something which is in limited supply, the price goes up. So it is with the US stock market at present. Reports suggest that investors' money is still pouring into stocks at a staggering rate, as low interest rates make alternative investments appear relatively unattractive. Merrill Lynch, the largest retail brokerage firm in the US, is thought to be attracting around Dollars 275m (Pounds 156.2m) every 24 hours. Other brokerage firms are also seeing substantial inflows. With this kind of 'weight of money' behind the market, it is perhaps unsurprising that Wall Street should continue to scale new heights - even if the heady daily gains of late-December and January are a thing of the past, and progress comes in fits and starts. The only events which seem likely to seriously reverse this situation include a serious setback in the economy or some dramatic change in the interest rate scenario. There has been little indication of either. That does not necessarily mean that future events will unfold smoothly: even if the weight of money gives a solid underpinning to the market, there are plenty of pundits who suggest that a temporary correction is due. This, they postulate, might take the Dow back below 3,200. So it was against this rather ambivalent background that the Dow Jones Industrial Index climbed almost 15 points to 3290.25 on Tuesday - nudging ahead of the previous week's record close, at 3283.32. But as with many of the 'new records' set recently, this remained a half-hearted affair. The more broadly-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index managed only a 0.4 point gain, to 412.85, shy of its all-time high. The Nasdaq Composite Index, which measures over-the-counter stocks, fell 1.22 points to Dollars 634.25. On Wednesday and Thursday, the nerves set in. Waves of profit-taking, ahead of Friday morning's unemployment data, caused falls of over 20 points in the Dow on both days. Publication of the figures provoked fewer ripples, the Dow still dithered. The economic statistics remain opaque - but even the worst news is not so bad that it merits a rethink by investors. Part of Tuesday's rise, for example, was attributed to the sharp rise in January's index of leading indicators. This showed a 0.9 per cent advance, compared with a 0.2 per cent fall in December. New single-home sales in January also surged, while, on Monday, the February 'purchasing managers' index' - another measure of activity in the industrial economy - showed a reading of 52.4 per cent. (Any figure over 50 per cent suggests that the economy is expanding, and in January, the index had stood at 47.4 per cent). Friday's unemployment figures were a slightly different story. There was an unexpectedly large rise in non-farm payrolls last month, up 164,000 while manufacturing employment rose by 12,000. This was tempered by the Labor Department's revision of its estimate for January's fall in non-farm jobs from 91,000 to 149,000. Meanwhile, the headline unemployment statistic rose by 0.2 percentage points to 7.3 per cent - the highest figure since July 1985. This broad picture aside, there are still plenty of individual situations which could give cause for concern. On Thursday, Toronto's Olympia &amp; York Developments, the property giant run by the Reichmann brothers, sent a shiver round the market. Rumours that the company might file for bankruptcy protection - speedily denied  - sent shares in several large US commercial banks lower. Chemical lost Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 31 1/2 , Chase Manhattan slipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 22 1/2 and even the mighty J. P. Morgan eased Dollars 1 to Dollars 59. ITT, the conglomerate whose interests range from insurance to hotels, was also active. News that the company was selling its remaining 30 per cent in France's Alcatel, sent the shares up Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 69 7/8 midweek. By Friday, in the wake of a more cautious stance by Rand Araskog, ITT's chairman, on further divestitures, the shares had fallen back to Dollars 63 7/8 . Anyone hoping to glean some insights in the economy's progress from the February sales figures posted by most large retailers on Thursday, meanwhile, would have simply been confused. At one end of the scale, Wal-Mart, the aggressive Arkansas-based discount retailer, reported a same-store sales gain of 20 per cent; by contrast, Woolworth managed just 3.1 per cent on the domestic front. Most other retailers came in at between six and nine per cent. Like most of the economic news at the moment, it could be better. But it could also have been worse.  -------------------------------- Monday    3275.27  +   7.60 Tuesday   3290.25  +  14.98 Wednesday 3268.56 -  21.69 Thursday  3241.50 -  27.06 Friday    3221.60 -  19.90  --------------------------------</p>

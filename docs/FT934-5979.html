			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: New management pulls South African gold mine back from brink A new management team claims it is breathing new life into East Rand Proprietary Mines, one of South Africa's oldest and deepest, which has been at death's door for many years, was about to default on its loans next month and faced closure. The South African government has in the past rescued ERPM from near-bankruptcy, conscious of the fact that it produced about 40m troy ounces of gold in its 100 years of operation and that there was probably much more to come out. Mr Glen Laing, recruited five months ago as managing director, said in London yesterday that a new mine plan would boost output from 257,000 ounces this year to nearly 385,000 ounces in 1997. A combination of higher ore grades and increased productivity would cut mining costs from Dollars 330 an ounce to Dollars 275 during those four years. The new team had already won agreement from the unions to move to seven-day working instead of the five days traditional in South African mines. This allowed 30 shifts to be worked instead of 24. Also a bonus scheme was making a substantial impact on productivity. The scheme was based on one used at the Harmony gold mine where productivity - measured in square metres of ore mined per man - improved by 46 per cent in the two years since it was introduced 'and saved that mine', said Mr Laing. Mr Deon Le Roux, previously mine manager at Harmony, is now mine manager at ERPM, The scheme encouraged more effective mining by linking bonuses to the rate of advance into the mine face and the grade of the ore produced. There was also a profit-sharing bonus for all employees. ERPM, located 25km south east of Johannesburg in the town of Boksburg, once employed 20,000. Now the workforce totals about 6,000. The underground mining lease is the largest of its kind in the world, covering 13km by 8km, of which only half has been mined so far. The gold comes from ore buried 3km to 3.5km deep. The problems of mining at these depths - rock instability, high temperatures and high humidity - make ERPM a high-risk mining operation. Mr Laing said ERPM had built up huge debts but the money had gone to complete the so-called Far East vertical shaft system that gave access to higher-grade ore as well as leaving the mine well-equipped in many areas. Now the company is raising R553m via a rights offer which will leave it debt free with about R100 surplus cash in the bank. ERPM is certain of collecting the money because the issue is fully underwritten by Paribas Capital Markets (about 60 per cent of the shares are owned by private French investors) and First-Corp Merchant Bank. Mr Laing was with a 'road show' making presentations to investors in the US, London and Paris.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] The chief of the presidential staff Sergey Filatov  believes that no serious risk is in sight of the Russian  Federation falling apart. Filatov told the public chamber at  the office of the President in the Kremlin on Saturday the  diminishing threat of a break-up of the Russian Federation was a  direct result of the treaty of social accord (Filatov is  chairman of the conciliatory commission to effect that document  -- INTERFAX).    "So far 863 political parties, non-governmental  organizations  and associations have signed that treaty and the  signature-raising campaign will go on", Filatov said.    He pointed to what he described as society's "ever more  neutral, in some cases negative attitude" to the opposition's  attempts to resist reform. He said that under the influence of  that treaty the opposition had shifted to "more civilized forms  of confrontation".    Filatov admitted that the social price of reform was very  high: "The gap between wealth and poverty is keenly felt by  society and crime and corruption rates are alarming." The chief  of the presidential staff described the latest package of  President Yeltsin's decrees on economic issues as an "instrument  of the fairest distribution of problems in society during the  transition phase".    Filatov believes that resolving problems of the transitional  period would be possible only in the climate of civic accord.  He said society needed stable rules of political struggle. At  the same time he said that the executive authorities were  prepared for a dialogue with any political forces, provided they  observed the Constitution of the Russian Federation.    Filatov said that attempts to recreate the USSR by force  might trigger a civil war. He said those who sought to revise  the Belovezh agreements and restore the USSR by force must  remember that they gamble with the lives of millions. "Attempts  to act on such ideas is the surest way to civil war comparable  in scale only to World War II".    Alongside other favorable changes resulting from the treaty  of social accord Filatov pointed to "other republics' growing  confidence in Russia". President Yeltsin's chief of staff  admitted that part of society was "ostalgic about real socialism  and sweet deceit and self-deceit".    Filatov said Russia's reformist and democratic forces had  approached a dramatic frontier, where new ideas had to be  formulated and strategy adjusted.    The presidential chief of staff described the crime  situation  in Russia as "close to an emergency". He said that was the main  reason that prompted President Yeltsin to sign the decree to  protect the population from gangsterism and organized crime.  "Ten explosions a day is a sure sign that criminal gangs impose  their mode of life and ideology on society", Filatov told  INTERFAX.    Filatov believes that the main reason why society disagrees  with the presidential decree is that it permits detaining  suspects for 30 days. He said that that measure was "borrowed  from the state of emergency law". Filatov believes that those  who argue this provision of the decree should be compensated in  legal terms, "by eliminating people's old-time fear of the  sweeping powers of policing agencies" are right, too. The chief  of presidential staff believes that that can be achieved with  assistance from the conciliatory commission for effecting the  treaty of social accord.    The speaker of the lower house of the Russian parliament  Ivan  Rybkin believes that the presidential decree "On Urgent Measures  to Protect the Population From Gangsterism and Other  Manifestations of Organized Crime" is a necessary measure. At  the same time he told journalists that in order to avoid  "frictions between the president and the Duma" Boris Yeltsin  should have presented in advance an appropriate bill of  amendments to the criminal code.    The State Duma last Friday included debates on the  presidential decree in its agenda, however, failed to begin it  due to the shortage of time. The State Duma's Security  Committee drafted a resolution entitled "On the Protection of  Constitutional Rights and Freedoms of Citizens While  Implementing Measures to Fight Against Crime" asked the  president to suspend the decree, because it ran counter to the  Constitution and the criminal code [sentence as received]. The  attention of the Supreme Court was drawn to the need to stick to  the current legislation in administering justice.</p>

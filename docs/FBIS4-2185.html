			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Zhang Weidi (1728 0251 1717)] </F>   [Text] Nanjing, 1 Apr (XINHUA) -- The 110,000 township  enterprises established by peasants in Jiangsu Province have  said good-by to the small-scale production and low-level  management that prevailed in their initial stage and begun to  participate in the market competition at home and abroad with a  fairly high level of productive forces.    Jiangsu's township enterprises have so far absorbed more  than  7.3 million workers, accounting for 80 percent of the total  staff members and workers of the province, and their economic  scale has rapidly expanded. Jiangsu Province established 110  provincial-level township enterprise groups in the past few  years. All these trans-regional and even trans-national large  groups have fixed assets worth over 50 million yuan, and more  than a half of them sell over 200 million yuan worth of goods a  year. In the southern part of the province, which has become  one of China's most important industrial areas, counties  (cities) whose township enterprises create more than 20 billion  yuan in industrial output value account for 50 percent of the  total, and those where township enterprises' industrial  aggregate exceeds 100 million yuan account for over 90 percent.    Since the beginning of the 1990's, Jiangsu's township  enterprises have greatly enhanced their capacity for  participating in the international economic exchanges.  According to statistics, they provided over 56 billion yuan  worth of goods for export in 1993, accounting for about 30  percent of the total value of the goods provided by all the  township enterprises in the country for export. So far, 10,000  township enterprises of Jiangsu Province have developed joint  investment and cooperation with foreign firms, and the foreign  capital to be brought in according to contracts totals more than  $7 billion. In addition, they have established 230 enterprises  in 36 countries and regions in the world. As was learned,  one-third of the township enterprises in Suzhou city had been  transplanted with the funds and technology from abroad, and  one-fourth of the income of the city's industrial township  enterprises was earned through the world market.    The technology and equipment and the technological  development capacity of Jiangsu's township enterprises are also  gaining more respect. According to pertinent departments,  Jiangsu has invested more than 10 billion yuan in the technical  transformation of its township enterprises over the past few  years to enable over a half of them to purchase advanced  domestic and foreign equipment. In Wuxi County, which is at the  top of China's 100 strong counties, all the enterprises whose  annual output value exceeds 50 million yuan have established  research institutes to make the county China's largest rural  scientific research base, with several hundred new products with  fairly high technology content being developed yearly.    Since last year, Jiangsu Province has begun to reorganize  the  property rights of its township enterprises and has promoted the  innovation of their systems through the shareholding system and  the shareholding cooperation system. Nearly 10,000 township  enterprises have experimented with the shareholding system.  They have drawn in over 2 billion yuan by selling stocks, and a  large number of rural private and individual enterprises have  also purchased stocks from township enterprises. As was  learned, Jiangsu's township enterprise groups organized through  the holding and buying of shares and joint investment possessed  10 percent of the total assets of all the province's township  enterprises.    The high-quality development of Jiangsu's township  enterprises is effecting a change in local rural society and  accelerating its rural industrialization and modernization.  According to a research report provided by the Jiangsu  Provincial Academy of Agricultural Science, judging from the  economic level, social structure, population quality, life  quality, and other indicators adopted in the world, the rural  areas in the southern part of Jiangsu Province have entered a  stage of modernization ahead of others. As was learned, Wuxi  city's per capita GNP exceeded 10,000 yuan last year, and the  per capita income of its peasants was 2,240 yuan.</p>

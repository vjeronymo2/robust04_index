			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Prosecutor acts on Polly Peck In a bizarre twist to the Polly Peck saga, a Turkish prosecutor has issued an order for the arrest of administrators of the collapsed fruit-to-electronics conglomerate on bribery charges, a lawyer for former Polly Peck chairman Asil Nadir said yesterday, Reuter reports from Nicosia. The lawyer, Ali Riza Gorgun, said he had received a copy of the arrest warrant for the three main administrators - Richard Stone and Michael Jordan of Coopers &amp; Lybrand and Christopher Morris of Touche Ross - and six of their colleagues as well as their Turkish lawyer. Mr Gorgun said the Istanbul prosecutor's office had acted on a complaint by Mr Nadir about how the administrators had handled the affairs of Polly Peck. A similar complaint had been lodged with the prosecutor's office in northern Cyprus, he added. Mr Nadir, who was charged with theft and false accounting following the collapse of Polly Peck, jumped bail in Britain and fled to his native northern Cyprus in May. He accuses the British authorities of mounting a conspiracy to deny him a fair trial.</p>

			<p>940106 FT  06 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Co-operation in Scott inquiry Sir, Your story, 'Further delays for Iraq arms inquiry' (January 5) suggests ministers are in some way responsible for delaying the work of Lord Justice Scott's inquiry. On the contrary, all serving ministers and former ministers have, thus far, co-operated fully. So far as Lord Trefgarne is concerned, I have been informed by his solicitors that he is considering with them whether to provide written and/or oral evidence. Christopher Muttukumaru, secretary to the inquiry, Inquiry into exports of defence equipment and dual use goods to Iraq, 1 Palace Street, London SW1E 5HE</p>

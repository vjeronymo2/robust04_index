			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / UK Company News: Warning hits Jessups share price SHARES OF Jessups tumbled by 9p to 46p yesterday after the Essex-based vehicle distributor unveiled a first-half loss, a reduced interim dividend and a warning on prospects for the second half. According to Mr Alan Jessup, chairman, losses of Pounds 189,000 (profits Pounds 975,000) for the half-year to end-February were attributable mainly to a downturn in new vehicle sales to both the retail buyer and the corporate sector. Profits at the operating level slumped from Pounds 2.81m to Pounds 1.31m. Turnover was relatively resilient at Pounds 44.98m (Pounds 48m) although the effective decline in sales was masked by 'compensations from after-sales activities'. Losses per share worked through at 3.94p (earnings of 5p). The interim dividend is cut to 1.5p (2.25p).</p>

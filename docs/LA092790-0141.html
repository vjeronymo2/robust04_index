			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPERA REVIEW;  </P> <P> MEDDLING WITH MOZART;  </P> <P> GOSPEL OF 'IDOMENEO' ACCORDING TO SENDAK AND CORSARO  </P> <P> Here we go again.  </P> <P> The wonders of a great opera are compromised by gimmickry. A meddlesome  director and designer refuse to trust the composer. The procedure has become  all too familiar.  </P> <P> In some instances, re-creational modernists manage to violate the letter of the  original law, yet still illuminate the spirit. That's terrific.  </P> <P> Other second-guessers are so intent on imposing their own irrelevant vision on  the piece at hand that they distort or even destroy the intended dramatic  impulses. They move against the music. That's irksome.  </P> <P> It becomes especially irksome when the music is sensitively conducted,  exquisitely sung and elegantly played. Sublime sound can go only so far to  outweigh ridiculous sight.  </P> <P> Take, for sad example, Mozart's "Idomeneo" as staged by Frank Corsaro,  illustrated by Maurice Sendak and conducted by Roderick Brydon for the Music  Center Opera on Tuesday.  </P> <P> If our records are accurate, Los Angeles had never before seen a major staging  of the lofty opera seria (USC mustered a modest workshop version in 1966). Los  Angeles still hasn't seen a faithful representation of this stylized  exploration of jealousy, devotion, heroism and renunciation on the island of  Crete in the wake of the Trojan War.  </P> <P> "Idomeneo," written in 1781 when Mozart had reached the ripe old age of 25,  isn't easy. It is long, slow and irrevocably bound to certain period  conventions. The plot, for all its convolutions, is static. The characters are  stereotypes. The musical structure relies on set formulas. Luckily, Mozart's  inspiration transcended any potential liabilities.  </P> <P> One wouldn't have guessed that at the Music Center. Corsaro decided that the  idiom needed to be juiced up. Forget classic nobility. Let's have a  psychosexual charade.  </P> <P> Idomeneo, the king of Crete, was really Leopold Mozart, the composer's  overbearing father. That was Corsaro's irrelevant concept. Idamante, the  troubled prince, was really Mozart himself. The opera, we were told, really  concerns the complex love-hate relationship between the paternal despot and the  youthful pretender to his aesthetic throne.  </P> <P> Calling Dr. Freud. And where are you, Peter Shaffer, when we don't need you?  </P> <P> Everyone loves Maurice Sendak. Everyone loves his cuddly shaggy dogs, his plump  cherubs, his naughty boys, his charming monsters. He is a master of dark-edged  humor, and his magical images cast their spell far beyond children's books.  With "Idomeneo," however, he seems to have strayed into the wrong scenic  milieu.  </P> <P> Reinforcing Corsaro's dubious historical concept, he plays the beginning and  the end in young Mozart's study. There's the young genius in a caricature of a  famous portrait on the wall. There's the boy himself, in the same powdered wig  and breeches, seated at the keyboard.  </P> <P> Quiet. He's composing something. Listen. We think it's "Idomeneo." Gosh.  </P> <P> Enter Papa Leopold, in similar Baroque attire. He scorns the kid's creative  effort. Perhaps he's jealous. No matter. We're off, for a while, to ancient  Crete. Sendak's Crete is a jumbled jungle of ungainly flats and drops, most of  which struggle in vain to avoid looking comical at worst, whimsical at best.  </P> <P> Sendak's costumes -- very unflattering to the women in the cast -- assign vague  fairy-tale antiquity to the non-"historical" participants. But King Idomeneo  remains the courtly Leopold Mozart throughout, and Idamante never forswears the  Baroque trappings of Amadeus. The result trivializes the mythology. It also  looks silly.  </P> <P> The Corsaro/Sendak madness does reflect a method, however obscure and dubious  that method may be. Too bad the management of the Music Center Opera didn't  deem an explanatory essay worthwhile. The audience deserves a little  enlightenment.  </P> <P> In many ways, this "Idomeneo" is best appreciated with eyes closed.  </P> <P> Brydon, who has replaced the originally scheduled Christof Perick, conducts  with tender, lyrical, reasonably stylish care. He accompanies his singers with  obvious compassion but never slights emotional impetus. In the process, he  elicits elegant support from the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra, obviously in  its element here.  </P> <P> He also has made some wise editorial decisions, relying on a nearly complete  version of the Munich edition of 1781. The only major cuts -- both pardonable  -- remove Arbace's second aria and the rather mechanical final ballet of  celebration.  </P> <P> Mozart wrote the role of Idamante for castrato, a vocal phenomenon now  gratefully extinct. Some companies opt for a tenor, but the Los Angeles forces  chose a mezzo-soprano of the Cherubino mold and thus sustained appropriate  timbral contrasts.  </P> <P> The cast functioned as an ensemble of virtuosos. Siegfried Jerusalem, the most  celebrated Wagnerian tenor of the day, brought manly dignity, ample agility,  dynamic finesse and burnished tone -- some passing pitch problems  notwithstanding -- to the title role. Susan Quittmeyer complemented him -- and  Corsaro's directorial conceit too -- as an Idamante of tremendous suavity and  sensitivity. She has become a trouser-role specialist with few peers.  </P> <P> Pamela Coburn looked a bit robust for the sweet-ingenue platitudes of Ilia, but  she sang with limpid, angelic tone that proved especially compelling in her  great aria, "Zeffiretti, lusinghieri."  </P> <P> Although her soprano isn't as dark or as heavy as cliche might have it in this  evil role, Christine Weidinger swept all before her with an Elettra of  galvanizing passion and stunning vocal bravura. She even managed those  hysterical descending cackles of the mad scene, "D'Oreste e d'Aiace," with easy  and accurate aplomb. That claim cannot be made for many a more celebrated  interpreter of the role.  </P> <P> The secondary roles were in good hands. Jonathan Mack coped crisply, even  sweetly, with the demanding but unrewarding duties of Arbace. When he wasn't  straining for high notes, John Atkins sang incisively as the High Priest. Louis  Lebherz boomed imposingly as the Voice of Neptune.  </P> <P> The performance began at 7:30 and ended after 11. The hours crept on apace.  </P></p>

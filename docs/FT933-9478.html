			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Industry keeps down price rises THE PRICES of goods leaving factories barely changed last month, reflecting the continued weakness of inflationary pressures in the economy. The producer prices index rose by a non-seasonally adjusted 0.1 per cent in July compared with June. The movement suggests that, in spite of signs of economic recovery, manufacturers remain reluctant to raise prices for fear of damaging demand. Prices last month were 4.1 per cent higher than a year before. Excluding food, drink and tobacco, for which price changes are more volatile, the index rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.3 per cent on the previous month to stand 2.5 per cent higher than a year before. Prices of raw materials and fuels used by manufacturing industry were unchanged in July against a revised 0.5 per cent increase in June. Although imported input prices have risen sharply since sterling left the European exchange rate mechanism last September, there has not been a corresponding increase in output prices. This indicates that producers have so far absorbed most of the the higher cost of raw materials. Falling labour costs - which account for about two thirds of total producer costs - have made it easier for manufacturers to cope with the higher costs of imports. Input prices were falling by 0.8 per cent year-on-year in September last year. They are now rising at a rate of 6.6 per cent, slightly lower than in March when the rate of increase was almost 8 per cent. The slowdown of input price inflation since March reflects the gradual strengthening of the pound on the foreign exchanges. Unadjusted, the input prices index fell 0.9 per cent month-on-month, reflecting seasonal falls in the prices of home-produced inputs for food manufacturers. The seasonally adjusted index was unchanged last month on the figure for June. The figures from the Central Statistical Office show that any upward pressure on producer prices is coming from imported food manufacturing materials, metals and other imported materials. Prices of imported food products used by manufacturers were 17 per cent dearer last month than in July last year while metals prices were up 16.2 per cent year-on-year. Chemicals prices fell 1.4 per cent month-on-month but were up 7.2 per cent compared with a year before. Home-produced food manufacturing materials were 4.3 per cent cheaper in July than in June. The sluggishness of producer price inflation suggests that the outlook for retail price inflation remains good.</p>

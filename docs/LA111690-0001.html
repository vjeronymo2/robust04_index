			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV WATCH;  </P> <P> POTATO PROGRAMS  </P> <P> For years, children's advocates and advice columnists have warned about the  dangers of too much TV for kids. For parents who worry that there's something  unhealthful about being a couch potato but do not know exactly what to tell the  young ones (especially if mom and dad are Oprah or football junkies  themselves), there is new ammunition.  </P> <P> In 1985, a study linked obesity in children with television. Now, researchers  at UC Irvine have discovered a correlation between television viewing and high  levels of cholesterol in youngsters.  </P> <P> The UCI study found that kids who watch between two and four hours a day are  twice as likely to have high levels of cholesterol as those who watch less than  two hours a day.  </P> <P> Those who watch more than four hours a day are four times as likely. Doctors  say that high cholesterol levels in children are a risk factor for  cardiovascular disease in adulthood.  </P> <P> Are kids somehow getting zapped with cholesterol rays by the tube? No, it's the  sedentary lifestyle that creates the problem. Dr. Kurt V. Gold, a resident in  pediatrics at UCI, says that kids who watch lots of TV are bombarded with ads  for junk food, and, indeed, they are big consumers of those items. And if kids  are watching television, they aren't physically active.  </P> <P> Dr. Gold suggests, only half in jest, that maybe parents should buy a TV set  that only operates when people are exercising. Short of that, how about simply  tuning out such notions as "average three hours a day of TV viewing" as an  acceptable family norm?  </P></p>

			<p>920825 FT  25 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A STEADY performance from sterling and the absence of any move in UK interest rates helped calm the futures market in strong trading yesterday, writes Christopher Price. The FT-SE contract for September delivery opened sharply down at 2,317 but then rallied as sterling held up and fears over a rise in base rates receded. This sentiment continued to drive the contract forward until 10am, when September reached its best level of the day of 2,340. From there, it began to drift away as first the weak gilts market and then poor UK trade figures undermined the contract. In the afternoon, a faltering dollar forewarned of a negative opening on Wall Street which further unhinged September. By mid-afternoon, the contract reached its low point of 2,310, before rallying towards the close. It finished at 2,316, down 58 from Friday's close and at a 2 1/2 -point premium to fair value of around 5 1/2 . Volume was a healthy 12,269 lots. Lacklustre turnover in traded options saw 23,847 contracts dealt, 14.057 of which were in the FT-SE option. Hanson was the top traded stock option on 916 lots, followed by Barclays on 824 and Commercial Union on 571.</p>

			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Observer: Present tension Reflective Liberal Democrats at the seaside town of Torquay for their party's annual jamboree may have bitter-sweet memories of 1985. That year in Torquay, David Owen held his most successful conference as leader of the old Social Democrats. Then, as now, the centrist forces were riding high in the polls, flushed with local election triumphs. There was the same sense of panic among the Tories. Now Paddy Ashdown hopes to cut the same sort of dash as Owen. But Lib Dems must be hoping comparisons end there. For Torquay 1985 marked a watershed; thereafter, it was all downhill as the Tories recovered and won in 1987. The Social Democrats split - the majority merging with the Liberals and the minority following Owen in a splinter group. Still, a reminder of the past which will not upset conference delegates is one of Torquay's more well-known landmarks - the Thatcher rock.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Part 830 is limited to activities at DOE nuclear facilities. Since ``nuclear facility'' is a defined term that does not contain all DOE laboratories or programs, the addition of ``laboratory or program'' could create ambiguity concerning the Scope of Part 830.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. One comment suggested that the definition of fissionable material was not broad enough and suggested that mixtures of nuclides, such as enriched uranium, be included in the definition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  DOE disagrees with this comment because the proposed definition includes mixtures of nuclides as long as the mixture includes one or more of the nuclides which can sustain a neutron-induced fission chain reaction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. A number of comments were received stating that the definition of ``graded approach'' was too vague, and additional guidance on its application is necessary. A comment was received that relative risk should be a mandatory consideration for a graded approach.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The definition of the term ``graded approach'' was developed to describe the process and factors used to determine which actions would be appropriate for a particular facility. DOE believes that this process should be sufficiently broad and flexible to take into account differences among various facilities. The intent of the graded approach is to permit DOE contractors the flexibility to implement activities and processes, as appropriate, to comply with the nuclear safety requirements for the individual facilities. The graded approach does not exempt a facility from a nuclear safety requirement. In applying a graded approach, however, a determination may be made that certain actions may not be appropriate for a particular facility. With respect to consideration of risk, this could be considered under factor six, ``any other pertinent factors.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Several comments stated that the definition of ``hazard'' was too general. It was felt that the definition should be expanded to provide a quantitative statement to establish a threshold for when a situation posed a hazard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> DOE disagrees with this comment. The term ``hazard'' includes all situations with any potential to cause harm to people, facilities, or the environment. Quantitative considerations are taken into account in the graded approach when the magnitude of a hazard is assessed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Several comments stated that the definition of ``hazard'' should be limited only to potential radiological releases because the Price-Anderson Amendments Act, which continued and expanded indemnification for DOE contractors from nuclear accidents and established the civil penalty program under 234A of the AEA, relates only to nuclear safety issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> DOE disagrees with this comment because nonradiological hazards may have nuclear safety implications. For example, nonradiological hazardous materials may contribute to the release of or contamination by radioactivity, such as initiating accidents, or worsening the consequences of accidents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. A number of comments were received stating that the definition of the term ``nonreactor nuclear facility'' was too vague and that some threshold relative to source term or some potential dose to the public or workers (a quantification) should be included in the definition. Several individuals stated that this quantification must be provided in the definition to prevent limited resources from being expended on non-nuclear or low hazard facilities. It was also suggested that the definition of the term ``nonreactor nuclear facility'' be modified by deleting the reference to graded approach in the definition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department disagrees with this comment because the proposed definition was intended to cover all situations (other than nuclear reactors) with the potential to cause radiological harm. The reference to the graded approach was included to take into account the differences that exist between facilities and, thus, to avoid a rigid application of nuclear safety requirements to divergent facilities and to encourage the taking of actions appropriate for particular facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Several comments recommended various operations (i.e., research and development laboratories, environmental restoration, sealed sources, Uranium Mill Tailings Remedial Action Program) be exempt from the provisions of these rules. The potential risks associated with each of these operations was cited as being significantly different than the risks posed by other nuclear facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> DOE has determined that all facilities with which nuclear materials are associated (except incidently) should be covered by part 830. A facility's improper use of, work with, or handling of nuclear materials could result in damage or injury caused by nuclear materials and, thus, are included in this DOE regulatory regime. The use of the graded approach will permit consideration of differences among different facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

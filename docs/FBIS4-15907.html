			<p>BFN     [Text] [No dateline as received] According to the  information of the Black Sea Fleet [BSF] press center,  Lieutenant General Shkidchenko, commander of the Odessa Military  District, arrived at the BSF mothball division stationed in  Odessa on 12 April. He read to the unit's personnel a directive  of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry on disbanding the division and  setting up on its basis the 1st Division Brigade for protecting  the Ukrainian Navy's waters. According to the BSF press center,  in violation of the Russian-Ukrainian agreement on the BSF, the  officers and warrant officers of the division were declared  private individuals. After this, Ukrainian servicemen broke  into office premises and seized the division's secret  department. In the afternoon, a group of military constructors  of the Ukrainian armed forces arrived at the unit in order to  remove the traces of the break-in.    A POSTFACTUM correspondent has learned from sources close to  the command of the Russian Navy that for the time being the  Ukrainian special troops have released only Aleksandr Zelenko,  captain second rank, chief of staff of the division.

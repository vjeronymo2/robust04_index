Russian Ambassador to U.S. Has Not Yet Been  Appointed"]    [Text] SEGODNYA, citing "diplomatic sources," has reported  that Yuliy Vorontsov, currently Russia's permanent  representative at the United Nations, has been appointed  Russia's new ambassador to Washington. Correspondingly, he has  been replaced at the United Nations by Deputy Foreign Minister  Sergey Lavrov. However, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Krylov,  who is in charge of personnel policy, did not confirm this  report yesterday to KOMMERSANT-DAILY's correspondent. Both  Vorontsov and Lavrov, according to unofficial information  received by KOMMERSANT-DAILY, may in fact be appointed to the  aforementioned posts. Currently Sergey Lavrov is at UN  headquarters in New York. KOMMERSANT-DAILY plans to publish an  interview with him in the near future. KOMMERSANT-DAILY will  follow up on the subject once corresponding presidential edicts  are signed.</p>

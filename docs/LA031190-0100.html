			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HANDYMAN Q&amp;A: COPING WITH HAZARD OF DIFFERENT WIRING  </P> <P> QUESTION: We bought our home in 1985, and plan to add several new electrical  circuits and install new light fixtures and ceiling fans into already existing  circuits. The problem is that all circuits, switches, light fixtures,  receptacles and appliance connections were wired with aluminum wiring  components.  </P> <P> We know we must replace failed switches and receptacles with ones that are  approved for use with aluminum wiring, but we don't know what to do about  installing new copper-wired fixtures in existing circuits. A friend warned us  that connecting copper to aluminum wiring could create a fire hazard. Is this  true?  </P> <P> ANSWER: Aluminum wiring is a potential fire hazard. Between 1965 and 1973 about  1.5 million homes were wired with aluminum, which at the time was approved by  the National Electrical Code. Later it was found that dangerous overheating in  15- and 20-amp circuits, at some connections between aluminum wires and  outlets, switches, fixtures and appliances resulted in fires.  </P> <P> Correcting the problem does not require rewiring the house. You can replace  switches and outlet receptacles that are unmarked or marked AL-CU, with devices  that are marked CO-ALR.  </P> <P> Or, you can use existing switches and outlets provided you attached short  copper pigtails to the ends of the aluminum wires and to the devices  (aluminum-to-aluminum splices are an exception). It's also necessary to connect  light fixtures and appliances with copper pigtails.  </P> <P> Because of the potential for a fire, it is important that copper wire pigtails  be attached to aluminum wires with specially designed connectors (wire-nuts can  be used, however, at copper-to-copper connections, such as light fixtures).  </P> <P> The Consumer Product Safety Commission recommends using a compression-type  crimp connector with heat-shrink insulation. These are called Copalum  Compression Connectors. They, and the crimping tool used to install them, are  made by AMP Inc., Copalum Program, MS 140-13 P.O. Box 360B, Harrisburg, Pa.  17105.  </P> <P> Furnace Blows Dust When It's Turned On  </P> <P> Q: Several years ago, we had a furnace installed and started getting a great  amount of dust every time it was on. When we had it checked out we discovered  that a return air duct had been laid over the dirt floor in the crawl space  with no cap, and all the dust was being brought into the house. Other than  taking the ducts down to remove the dirt, is there anything we can do?  </P> <P> A: All warm-air furnace systems must have a filter in the return duct to trap  dirt and dust in the airstream. The filter prevents airborne particles from  getting into the air.  </P> <P> There could be several ways the airstream that enters the room picks up the  particles. The filter may be dirty, it may not be the correct size or it may  not have been installed properly so particles slip past it. Or, you may not  even have a filter.  </P> <P> If none of the above causes the problem, you should consider installing an  electrostatic filter in the return duct. These filters are effective in  removing dust and dirt from the air.  </P> <P> We've assumed you've replaced the missing end cap on the return duct, but you  should also seal the joints between the sections with duct tape. Also, a  portion of the return duct in the crawl space should be insulated.  </P></p>

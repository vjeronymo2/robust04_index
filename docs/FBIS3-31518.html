			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Czech Minister of Defense Antonin Baudys made a  proposal at an extraordinary news conference at the Ministry of  Defense on the resolution of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Martin Dorazin has phoned in:    [Dorazin] The main aim is stop the war immediately. If you  do not give a solution to the warring sides they will not stop  fighting, Minister Baudys said. One cannot, however, seek a  solution that would disadvantage one of the sides. According to  Antonin Baudys, one has to give guarantees to the sides involved  in the fighting.    The basic idea of the Czech proposal, therefore, takes its  starting point as the ethnic and religious background of the  Bosnian conflict. We can stop this war if the states whose  religious and cultural identity is connected with the ideals of  the warring sides become the guarantors of developments and the  overall solution.    Minister Baudys proposes to create an executive goodwill  committee in the United Nations in which Russia, Greece, Turkey,  Pakistan, France, and Italy would be represented. These  countries would thus take over direct protection of the  countries of the former Yugoslavia.    Baudys's plan is based on the fact that the solution must be  sought with a long-term perspective and that an immediate  solution is not known by anyone. A short-term aim of Baudys's  plan is disarmament, administrative arrangements, and the  punishment of war criminals regardless of their national origin.    Political and diplomatic activities would follow in the  coming two to five years, as would economic reconstruction.  Conditions should arise for putting an end to direct  protection. This would be followed for a period of up to 10  years by a long-term solution and an overall settlement of the  Bosnian conflict.</p>

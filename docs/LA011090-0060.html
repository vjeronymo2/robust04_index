			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> ALBANIA, LAST OF STALINIST STATES, MAY FALL NEXT  </P> <P> East Europe's last Communist domino, rigidly Stalinist Albania, may be  tottering.  </P> <P> The fall of the Nicolae Ceausescu regime in nearby Romania, coupled with severe  economic problems in Albania itself, last month triggered the first serious  anti-government demonstration since the Communist revolution in 1944, U.S.  analysts say.  </P> <P> The student-led protest in the northern city of Shkoder, Albania's  second-largest city and a major industrial and transportation center, appears  to have been put down "immediately and violently," according to a State  Department official, though the event passed almost unnoticed in the West.  </P> <P> But the growing undercurrents of resistance to Europe's most backward, isolated  and totalitarian regime led a senior U.S. analyst to predict that "Albania will  fall as a Communist, Stalinist state -- if not from an uprising, then from  economic necessity."  </P> <P> A State Department specialist agreed. "Now that Romania is over, all eyes are  moving to Albania. . . . It's only a question of timing and how it plays out."  </P> <P> Upheaval in Albania would complete a clean sweep of the Continent's Communist  regimes.  </P> <P> A land of rugged mountains along the Adriatic Sea, Albania has been ruled sinc  1944 by a Communist government so uncompromising that its leaders broke with  Moscow in the 1960s, criticizing Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev as too  soft. They still count Soviet dictator Josef Stalin as their model.  </P> <P> Now, however, President Ramiz Alia appears to be on the defensive. Alia, a  relative centrist in a fragmented Politburo, is thought to be uncertain whether  to crack down or ease up.  </P> <P> The senior analyst said: "We're seeing a pattern of economic concessions and  warnings to people that what happened elsewhere is not going to happen in  Albania. The regime is obviously nervous."  </P> <P> For example, Alia, in his New Year's address to the nation, alluded to the  pressures engendered by the dramatic pace of change elsewhere in Eastern  Europe: "The events that have occurred recently in East Europe have inspired  certain known anti-Albanian forces to resume the campaign of slanders against  our country. But, as our people say, they cannot succeed in doing us harm."  </P> <P> Since last summer, there have been unconfirmed reports of demonstrations in  other Albanian towns and villages, including the oil center at Fier and the  southern city of Korca.  </P> <P> Albania's economy has suffered throughout much of the 1980s, bringing  increasing deprivation to what was already Europe's poorest state. After three  years of drought, the country, once self-sufficient, had to import food in  1988.  </P> <P> Albanian officials have reported publicly that 1989 brought a marked recovery,  but a U.S. official warned, "None of their figures have ever been reliable."  </P> <P> "Economic difficulties and necessity are driving Albania into the 20th Century  and forcing it to deal with the outside world," another U.S. official said.  </P> <P> As with most of the new opposition movements in Eastern Europe, anti-government  activity appears to be centered among students. They are a particularly  important segment of the population of Albania because, with one of the highest  birthrates in Europe, an estimated two-thirds of its 3.2 million people are  under 30 years old.  </P> <P> Ironically, the Communist regime may have helped spawn its own opposition.  Albanian government statistics show that only 15% of the population was  literate in 1944. In one of its few positive accomplishments, the regime has  raised that figure to 75%, according to U.S. analysts.  </P> <P> "This generation of Albanian youth is pretty well educated. It's surprising how  many speak foreign languages, especially German and English," the State  Department specialist said.  </P> <P> "They're also not as isolated as we once thought," he added.  </P> <P> Another U.S. expert agreed: "Albania is an island politically from the rest of  Eastern Europe. But geographically it is still there -- and the impact has to  be felt.  </P> <P> "Albanians are not isolated from news. They get Yugoslav, Greek and Italian TV,  plus the Voice of America. They even get 'Dallas' in Italian. The Albanian  press has also given pretty accurate coverage of events in Romania. They know  what's going on," he said.  </P> <P> "They want to read, to travel, to eat well and to be fashionable," he said.  </P> <P> In an officially sanctioned poll last fall, students showed unprecedented  interest in Western rock music.  </P> <P> The Albanian press has recently reported on extensive "hooliganism," widely  interpreted by Western specialists as a denunciation of new student activism.  </P> <P> "This is going to be a young people's revolution," one such analyst predicted.  </P> <P> Another potential source of opposition comes from within the peasant community,  which accounts for 70% of the population and is divided among Albania's  legendary clans.  </P> <P> "(The late President Enver) Hoxha never controlled the peasants. And among the  peasants today, the Communists have no credibility. They are known only for the  negative, not the positive," a U.S. analyst said. "The peasants don't think in  terms of liberation. They only know that the government has taken away their  land and their animals."  </P> <P> Hoxha, who died in 1985, was the guerrilla leader who led the resistance  against the Italians and Germans in World War II and who ruled the state for  four decades in a staunchly Stalinist fashion.  </P> <P> The tightly knit clans have also proven largely impenetrable by the state's  Draconian secret police, the Sigurimi, U.S. officials say.  </P> <P> Ironically, the first visible signs of opposition have emerged at a time when  Alia appears to be moving cautiously toward reform. In a series of steps, he  has encouraged Albania's government-run media to report objectively about some  issues and has publicly criticized the government bureaucracy.  </P> <P> He has also allowed a handful of American tourists to visit and has established  links with American-Albanian organizations.  </P> <P> Alia has even eased the country's official atheism, allowing religious  ceremonies in private homes.  </P> <P> There have also been tantalizing hints of a desire on Alia's part for official  contacts with the United States -- the first from an Albanian leader since the  1950s.  </P> <P> An official of the Albanian Orthodox Church in the United States, the Very Rev.  Arthur Liolin, was granted a brief meeting with Alia in November, the first  time an Albanian Communist leader has met with such a prominent religious  figure.  </P> <P> Liolin met last week with Asst. Secretary of State Raymond Seitz and said  Albania has loosened its prohibition on religious practices and is seeking  business contacts with U.S. firms. "They are very interested in the United  States," he said in a telephone interview.  </P> <P> The United States has no diplomatic relations with Albania at any level, a  State Department official said.  </P> <P> Alia also allowed the publication of a book that denounced the brutality,  absolute power and human rights abuses of the Sigurimi.  </P> <P> "Alia is trying to save the (Communist) Party by finding scapegoats, either in  the bureaucracy or the secret police," said Elez Biberaj, the director of the  VOA's Albanian service and the author of several works on Albania.  </P> <P> He and several U.S. officials pointed out that Alia is trapped in a political  Catch-22.  </P> <P> "The party must reform itself for the sake of the economy, and there are some  indications that Alia is trying to do it. But if he should carry out radical  reforms, it would almost surely lead to the decline of the party and the  system. It's a no-win position," Biberaj said.  </P> <P> U.S. officials predict that Albania's looming upheaval is likely to be violent.  </P> <P> "When Albania goes, it will probably go along the lines of the Romanian model.  In other words, it will start with an incident, a protest over something like a  missed food shipment. That will lead to massive repression and deaths. Then it  snowballs into an uprising," a U.S. analyst said.  </P></p>

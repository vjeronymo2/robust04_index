			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Alberto Pepe Leira] </F>   [Text] Montevideo, 1 Jan (EFE) -- In an interview granted  to EFE, during which he analyzed the 45 months of his government  and the local and international situation, Uruguayan President  Luis Alberto Lacalle stated that Europe is heading toward a not  very bright future, a period "very similar to that of 1930,  closed and with a sense of xenophobia."    He also expressed his optimism over the possibility of  overcoming the common import tariff obstacle within Mercosur  [Common Market of the South] and the implementation of the  integration process among his country, Argentina, Brazil, and  Paraguay as of 1995.    Lacalle attributed the inadequate results of the Uruguay  Round of the GATT (General Agreement on Trade and Tariff) talks  to the protectionist measures imposed by Europe, while locally  he discarded the representative nature of the Chamber of  Industries and the main union central, which is controlled by  the left, which have joined forces to criticize and pressure his  government.    According to the Uruguayan president today's world is quite  different from the one that existed when the Uruguay Round was  created in Punta del Este in 1986.    He said: "Copernican changes had taken place, and the  impetus given by Uruguay at the proper time was very important,  as there were times of optimism and of development in the most  important economies, with the purpose of making trade more  sustainable."    He added: "Today we are facing a very recessive Europe,  which has prevented the Uruguay Round from acting in a more  positive manner in the world economy."    Lacalle was more optimistic within the South American  framework, and said that Mercosur will finally be consolidated.    "We have one obstacle left to overcome -- the common import  tariff -- and with a little bit of realism we will be able to  come to a decision according to the countries' interests. I  think we have achieved a lot within Mercosur, and must not  forget that we have been working on it for only three years," he  said.    Lacalle added: "Intrazonal trade has multiplied, and in our  country it has been the great shakeup causing many people to  start thinking of the future and of investing. I already  consider it a success, and hope that when we presidents meet we  will be able to make a similar judgment."    Concerning reactions against his government by industrial  businessmen and union leaders, he said "they startle me,"  because we have reached the lowest historical level of  unemployment and the highest level of investment in the past 20  years.    Lacalle said he considers very important "the 15 percent  economic growth of the gross domestic product in this stage of  government action."    He stressed the continuous drop in the unemployment rate,  which in 1993 had an average rate of 8.4 percent, the greatest  drop since 1981.    "Unemployment has been reduced, and therefore if it were not  allied to political interests, the union organization PIT-CNT  [Interunion Workers Plenum-National Workers Convention] would  have been saying that this employment policy is best for  workers," he said.    He said that "in Spanish terms we would say that a policy  that reduces strikes must be praised by the union organizations,  but we all know that we are in a somewhat peculiar country, and  I have no doubt there are obvious political intentions on the  part of the PIT-CNT which do not represent the majority of  Uruguayan workers."    Concerning the Chamber of Industries, Lacalle said that it  does "represent some industries, because I know other  businessmen who tell us that the sooner we accelerate the  opening process the better."    The Uruguayan president added: "I therefore see that in the  exercise of liberty which is so valuable for us, we have  opinions which I do not believe to be the exact expression of  the large sectors which they are said to represent."    "The results of the last 45 months are emerging in a  positive  light, because what we had seen before from the government is  now being seen by the people as part of a consistent, clear, and  stable economic policy," he said.    Lacalle insisted that his government practices "social  liberalism" despite its policies being characterized as  "neoliberal," which is traditionally understood as "opposite or  at least contradictory to social-oriented policies."    "However, the arrangement of finances and of the deficit,  the  foreign debt renegotiation, and fiscal prudence have gone hand  to hand with a doubling in budget resources assigned to  education and health," he said.    He added that despite having a minority in Congress, and  having organized a plebiscite against the partial privatization  of state companies, his policy "has brought, to the extent  possible, a considerable improvement in public finances and  administration."    "Taking into consideration all these problems, the results  appear to be much brighter because they are obtained in the  midst of great difficulties," he said.    Lacalle expects that 1994 "will not be a year off because it  is an electoral year, as three months are more than enough for  an electoral campaign."    According to the president the executive branch will send to  Congress important initiatives, and he expects their approval  "in a year which has no reason to be unproductive."</p>

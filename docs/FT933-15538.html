			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: UK food retailers To the puzzlement of investors, two leading grocers have just articulated seemingly contradictory views of the industry's future. According to Mr Archie Norman, chief executive of Asda, it does not work. Looming saturation and growing price competition will undermine profitability. Sainsbury, though, begs to differ. According to Mr David Sainsbury, product of generations of grocery genes, profits will continue to rise. Discount stores have not significantly hit sales. Saturation is a distant prospect. There remain 150 grocery outlets for every one Sainsbury store in the UK. Perversely, both interpretations may be right. The difference is over time-scale. The question is not whether the rate of profits growth will be eroded but how quickly. In the 1980s, efficiency gains from information technology, centralised distribution and fancy out-of-town superstores enabled grocers to ratchet up gross margins every year. But this process is running its course while falling inflation imposes whole new disciplines. The big grocers will maintain earnings momentum for a while but even Sainsbury does not expect further gross margin growth. The food retailing sector will therefore remain a strategic sell - unless cunning diversification plans materialise. But there is scope for tactical buying. Even bearish forecasts suggest that a slowing Sainsbury should lift profits by one third to Pounds 1bn by 1996. With the sector having sunk to an all-time low, it may soon be due a bounce.</p>

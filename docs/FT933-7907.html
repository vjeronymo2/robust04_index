			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Modest rise in inflation lifts hopes of upturn: Portillo damps expectations of early cut in interest rates MODEST price increases coupled with rising retail sales suggest the UK is on course for a sustained economic recovery and yesterday prompted the government to damp expectations of early interest rate cuts. Retail sales were up 4.4 per cent in July compared with a year ago, the biggest year-on-year increase for more than four years, although they fell 0.2 per cent compared with June. The headline inflation rate fell by 0.2 per cent on the month, leaving the annual rate only slightly higher than June's 30-year low of 1.2 per cent. Retail prices rose 1.4 per cent in the year to July. Excluding mortgage interest payments, they rose 2.9 per cent, up from 2.8 per cent in June, inside the Treasury's 1-4 per cent target range. Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, reiterated that the government was not yet prepared to cut interest rates from 6 per cent. 'I don't want to lead you to expect any changes whatsoever,' Mr Portillo said on television yesterday. His comments sent the pound sharply higher. In London it closed up 2 1/4 pfennigs on the day at DM2.545. Against the dollar it closed up just under three cents at Dollars 1.5125, gaining further in New York to close at Dollars 1.5175. Expectations of steady UK economic growth were reinforced by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, a leading economic research body. But it warned that inflation is also likely to pick up next year. The institute forecast that growth would accelerate to an annual rate of 3 per cent by the final quarter of this year and average 2.9 per cent in 1994. While the institute expects underlying retail price inflation to stay within the government's target range this year, it forecast that both the 'headline' and underlying inflation rates would reach around 4.5 per cent by the middle of next year. The institute expects the government to raise indirect taxes by about Pounds 2.5bn and cut interest rates by 0.5 points in its November Budget. But it said the rate cut might have to be reversed in 1994 as inflation moves above the official target range. The Central Statistical Office figures showed that in the latest three months retail sales rose by 0.7 per cent compared with the previous quarter, and by 3.6 per cent compared with the same three months a year ago. Thus the small July drop did not break the upward trend in retail sales. The figures suggest that sales by mixed businesses - mainly department stores - are leading the rise. In the three months to July, sales volumes rose a seasonally adjusted 1.9 per cent, compared with the previous three-month period. Food retailers' sales rose 0.4 per cent. Sales by non-food retailers were up 0.4 per cent in the latest quarter, with the strongest performance coming from household goods. These rose 3 per cent in the three months to July to stand 10 per cent up on a year ago. Clothing and footwear sales fell by 1 per cent in the latest three months.

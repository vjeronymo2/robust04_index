			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  THE STAR </H8>   Prisoners in ANC Offices `Highly Disturbing' -- "Reports  that  five men were detained in a cell at the ANC's regional  headquarters in Johannesburg are highly disturbing," notes a  page-20 editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 19  April. "They compound fears that the ANC believes it is a law  unto itself and that a malignant authoritarianism lurks beneath  its declared love of democracy." The detention of the men in  ANC regional headquarters "follows the ANC's refusal to allow  police to search their national headquarters at Shell House  after eight Zulu royalists were gunned down outside the building  on March 28. At the time there were allegations that the  marchers had been killed by snipers operating from rooftops of  Shell House and nearby buildings." "Doubts have been cast on  its claim that it was an innocent party in the Shell House  massacre and that is guards fired only when the marchers tried  to invade the building. Ballistic tests could have established  the facts but the ANC chose to thwart the police investigation  and, arguably, the due process of law. These signs do not augur  well for the future."  <H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>   IEC Spending Public Money -- Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in  English on 19 April says the Independent Electoral Commission's  (IEC) budget is "commendably frank about how it intends to spend  R700m [million rand] by the end of May, detailing everything  from salaries to stationery." However, "taxpayers are entitled  to know not just where the money is going, but what is being  done to contain costs and ensure value for money." "Neither the  IEC, nor the Transitional Executive Council which drew up its  rules, can regard themselves as too important to cut costs.  They are dealing with the public purse, not a bottomless pit."    Peacekeeping Force To `Provoke Conflict' -- A second  editorial on the same page says the death of journalist Ken  Oosterbroek on the East Rand on 18 April is "a shocking reminder  of the tenuousness of life in South Africa." The shooting  "could well be put down to a stupidly naive decision of our  political leaders. The National Peacekeeping Force is the  product of a legitimate political desire to establish a  multiparty, politically non-partisan force in the run-up to the  elections. In principle, a good idea. In practice, as numerous  experts warned, there was insufficient time to recruit and train  a force which would be able to carry out that function  competently. It has been guilty of indiscipline. Worse, with  Inkatha's non-participation, it was always going to be seen as a  partisan force, and therefore more likely to provoke conflict in  some areas than contain it."</p>

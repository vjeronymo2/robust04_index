			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Theodor Troev report: ``Water Chiefs Fight a Tidal Wave of </F> Red Tape'']    [Text] Today, there are some 30 European Union [EU]  directives or decisions concerned with controlling water. Their  implementation over the past two decades has involved  substantial sums of money.    But key EU officials on one side, and top executives  representing the industry on the other, often have conflicting  views on the problems faced by the sector.    Recently, some industrialists appealed to companies to do  all  they could to ensure that those who make the decisions in Europe  are fully aware of the cost consequences of new directives and  take into consideration the consumers' willingness to pay.    Tom Garvey, deputy director-general on environment at the  European Commission, admits that the Commission is ``sometimes  criticised for making proposals for new legislation without  giving proper consideration to the financial implications.''    He argues, though, that the cost of providing water to very  demanding standards has to be set against the advantage of the  health protection it affords. ``There are two possible points  of departure for such a debate. Firstly, can we afford to pay  for the standards which are set? And secondly, can we afford  not to have such standards?,'' Garvey says.    However, water and waste management companies such as  Britain's Severn Trent draw attention to the huge amount of  money that Europe would need to spend in order to get anywhere  near the standards, for example, of the UK or Switzerland.  ``The enormity of the number of directives -- like the issues  it raises -- renders the whole debate meaningless on a  Europe-wide basis,'' says Roderick Paul, Severn Trent's chief  executive.    The water industry in England and Wales has needed to spend  28 billion pounds ($42bn) to improve its services. Severn Trent  itself has spent more than 2bn pounds over the past four years  to achieve high standards. Apart from providing water services  in the UK, the company's waste water services business handles  domestic, commercial and industrial waste in Belgium. ``When  one considers EU directives in their broadest sense, I always  find it strangely perverse that Severn Trent is helping Flanders  to run its waste water services operation, and that Brussels  itself has no sewage treatment capability,'' says Paul.    Future economic growth is seen by some to be adversely  affected by the high costs for clean water. ``The alternative  -- poorly managed polluted water supplies -- may be an even  worse threat,'' argues Garvey. He urges water sector officials  in Europe to use the best available scientific knowledge, as in  this way ``we are more likely to be able to keep the price of  our water under control in the future.''    However, it may take some time before such a message is  acted  upon by all EU members. Valerie Homer, deputy director of the  Water Companies Association in London, says the UK is the only  EU country which issues comprehensive annual reports on the  quality of water. Denmark and Portugal also prepare reports, but  neither covers the entire country. In 1996, every EU country  will be obliged for the first time to produce a report on  compliancy with the water directives. This will be the first  occasion when it might be possible to draw a clearer picture of  the situation in Europe.    Most water industries have either gone through change or are  about to be reformed. In countries such as France and the UK  they have been privatised, but water in most EU states is still  controlled by municipal authorities. In Spain, public and  private companies co-exist. Public subsidies towards capital  development costs are available in some countries and not in  others. Tariff structures also vary; water is only metered in  certain countries.    Paul believes that the way to meet cost challenges of EU  regulations is to say that everything must be relative, because  the basis upon which the regulations are set vary from country  to country. He says: ``Apart from the EU, the last word lies  with the industry. We cannot go on expecting the customer to  pay for whatever the regulator's latest ideas may cost.''</p>

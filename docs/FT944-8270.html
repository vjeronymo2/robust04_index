			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: UBS under pressure The battle between the board of Union Bank of Switzerland and Mr Martin Ebner, the maverick fund manager, is nearing its climax. Tomorrow investors will vote on a board proposal to strip the bank's registered shareholders, of which Mr Ebner's BK Vision is the largest, of their special voting rights. For registered shareholders, it is clear what to do. Their shares enjoy an effective premium of 17 per cent over the bank's bearer stock, which would be wiped out if the board's proposal carried the day. Given that registered shareholders command 51 per cent of the bank's votes, one might think their self-interest would settle the battle. But things are not so simple. UBS, through its fund management arm, holds power of attorney over a large slug of its own shares. By voting them in favour of the board proposal, it may well be able to neutralise other registered shareholders. As a result, the bearer shareholders' votes will also be crucial. For them, the essential question is whether it is in their interests for Mr Ebner to be stripped of his influence. Probably not. Though Mr Ebner has not spelt out a complete strategy for UBS, he is pressing the bank to improve its returns - perhaps by focusing on its lucrative fund management arm and reducing its less profitable retail banking network. UBS says it too plans to improve profitability. But it is hard to avoid the conclusion that it has been spurred to do so by Mr Ebner's prodding. If he is marginalised, UBS will be under less pressure to perform. So bearer shareholders, too, should vote against the board.</p>

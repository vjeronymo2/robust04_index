			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Arts: Mirandolina - Theatre in London Good playwrights write for actors, bad playwrights despite them. Carlo Goldoni (1707-93) wrote scores of plays that were gifts for actors - but gifts that challenged them. So it is dismaying to feel the Lyric Hammersmith's new version of his Mirandolina fall flat. The Goldoni productions I have seen have taught me that, though you can stage Goldoni in a wide variety of ways, the key factor is vitality. Without spontaneity, without intensity, Goldoni evaporates, and we are left with little to watch but crummy old formulas. (Like Shakespeare and other great playwrights, Goldoni was forever reworking received material.) Here, the six actors all seem to be working in different styles, and everything is laborious. Mirandolina, an innkeeper, is very successful at getting men to fall in love with her - but she has to work hard to vanquish the Cavaliere, an avowed misogynist. She is no mere seductress; she has streaks both of the feminist and the androphobe. The air should be full of intelligent contest. Here, however, Caroline Quentin makes Mirandolina's methods so obvious that the Cavaliere (Reece Dinsdale) seems a dolt. The lines do not dance (though Quentin tries to make them do so); the actors underrate both Goldoni and the audience. They project forcefully into the theatre, but, because the personalities they project are stale, the effect is meagre. The director is Dalia Ibelhauptaite. She directed a decent staging of Goldoni's The Impresario from Smyrna at the Old Red Lion this spring: decent, I now suspect, mainly because the tiny stage space gave the play an intensity that is utterly absent here. The most successful element of Mirandolina is also the most bizarre: Ashley Martin-Davies's scenery, which includes surreal effects - eg a blue piano hanging in the air - and daring clashes of colour. For the seduction scene, an orchard of suspended separate fruit descends to head height: so that Mirandolina lead the Cavaliere through a Hanging Garden of Eden, giving him bites of one apple after another. But Designer's Theatre cannot carry Goldoni. Did Ibelhauptaite intend to elicit any correspondingly surreal acting style from her cast? If so, she has not succeeded. As the Conte, Graham Turner commits several cheap crimes: he employs a plebeian accent in an aristocratic role, he uses blatantly modern movements within exaggerated period costumes, and he tries making the same joke several times. The hangdog Robert Goodale is miscast as Mirandolina's important servant Fabrizio: no spark, too old. Tim McMullan's Marchese is that worst theatrical type, a dull fop. Nobody listens to anybody else with any liveliness. Robert David Macdonald's new translation omits some minor characters, and, with them, some shrewd comedy. The English text has some clever 'quotations' from Shakespeare - usually, however, juxtaposed with unstylish expressions such as 'I mean'. Poor Goldoni's clever play about one woman's efforts to win the battles of love and power has crumbled into a feeble English sex comedy in period frocks. Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith</p>

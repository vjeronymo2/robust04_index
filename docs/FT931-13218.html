			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Kashmir's plight THE MISERY of Kashmir has tended to be forgotten amid the upsurge in disputes elsewhere. It should not be. Thousands have died in Indian-held Kashmir during the insurgency of the past three years. Human rights abuses are commonplace. The current visit by Mr John Major to India offers an opportunity to renew pressure for a solution. India and Pakistan, which have fought two wars over Kashmir, remain at loggerheads. Britain has suggested three steps, to be pursued simultaneously: India should foster political dialogue leading to elections in Indian-held Kashmir and the observance of human rights; Pakistan should not give assistance to militants in Indian-held Kashmir; and the two countries should talk to each other. There is no sign that any of this will happen. Though the Delhi government has announced that elections will be held in Kashmir, there is little prospect that they could be, or that they would be meaningful. India maintains a force of some 400,000 in Kashmir to contain insurgency. Its cause suffered a severe setback on January 6 when paramilitary troops went out of control in Sopore and killed over 50 local people. By insisting that Kashmir is a domestic problem and seeking to solve it by little other than brute force, India has alienated most Kashmiris. An attempt at a political solution, with reduced military presence and moves to win the hearts of Kashmiris, is urgently needed. Talks need to be held under international auspices - whether Britain, the Commonwealth or the UN - in order to try to solve the Kashmir issue once and for all. Whether or not independence were on the agenda, such discussions would not be credible to Kashmiris unless they had some form of representation at the table. It would be most important for the parties not to get bogged down - as they tend to - in fruitless argument about what happened in 1947, but to consider the way forward. India and Pakistan can expect continued pressure from the new US administration on their nuclear plans. International aid donors will increasingly look askance at the human rights records if there is no progress in Kashmir. But the best reason for action is that, as both pursue radical economic reforms, they need to contract military spending and expand trade opportunities. A Kashmir solution would offer scope for both, and bring long-overdue peace to the Kashmiris.</p>

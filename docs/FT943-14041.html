			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Man in the News: Brussels' beguiling new Burgermeister - Jacques Santer, the next president of the European Commission / Lionel Barber on the Luxembourg prime minister chosen to replace Jacques Delors Mr Jacques Santer is known as the man who never says no. Nicknamed 'Smiling Jacques' or 'Champagne Jacques', the long-serving prime minister of Luxembourg, who was selected yesterday as the next president of the European Commission, is a low-key operator who avoids confrontation and specialises in forging compromise. By drifting towards Mr Santer - who was nobody's first choice in the contest for Commission president - European Union leaders could not have chosen a more different character from Mr Jacques Delors, the volatile visionary who has been at its head for the past 10 years. History will show that they have made an important statement about the future direction of the EU. The Santer Commission signals a period of consolidation in the process of integration in Europe, a pause for breath after the bold leaps forward marked by the Single European Market, the European Economic Area, and the grand design for European monetary and political union - all of which bore Mr Delors' indelible stamp. The risk that Mr Santer's appointment will weaken the institutional power and political leadership role of the European Commission is serious, though senior EU diplomats cautioned yesterday that it is premature to pass judgment. Much will depend on the quality of the Santer team and the degree of support the new president can expect from the Franco-German axis, a crucial factor in Mr Delors' successes in the late 1980s, when he became synonymous with Mr Europe. It will also depend on whether Mr Santer, like Mr Delors, can grow in the job during the five-year term which he starts on January 5 next year. Born in the small Luxembourg town of Wasserbillig in 1937, Mr Santer, 57, has spent almost all his life in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. His mighty micro-state has deftly exploited free trade, open borders and a favourable tax regime to build a thriving economy near the centre of a single European market of 340m people. Mr Santer's political career took off in 1972 when he was appointed secretary of state for cultural and social affairs. He became leader of his Social Christian party in 1972, a post which he held until 1982. Long standing in the shadow of Prime Minister Pierre Werner, the intellectual godfather of European monetary union, Mr Santer waited patiently for the top job which he took over in 1984, having held several ministerial posts, including finance. Mr Santer has won re-election three times, most recently in last month's poll. Asked about his strengths, an old schoolfriend who has kept in touch with the prime minister, said: 'He is not a slave to his work. He does not sit at his desk from 6am to 10pm thinking he is the most important person in the country. You meet him everywhere, at each party. He is accessible to everyone.' Another colleague who knows Mr Santer well said that the prime minister is a good delegator, with a light touch and a tough streak. 'He will never say no, but that does not mean he lets himself be pushed around.' Mr Santer's appointment has evoked memories of the selection of Mr Gaston Thorn as president of the European Commission in 1980. Mr Thorn, himself a former Luxembourg prime minister, took over from Lord Jenkins, the former Labour cabinet minister, and served without distinction. Mr Thorn was overshadowed by Viscount Etienne Davignon, the powerful industry commissioner; and many predict that a similar fate could await Mr Santer should heavyweights such as Sir Leon Brittan, the chief EU trade negotiator, retain their posts. Yet Luxembourgers who know both Mr Santer and Mr Thorn argue that the comparisons between the two men are flawed. 'Thorn was a tough guy who had been chairman of the United Nations general assembly, but he was a poor prime minister of Luxembourg. Santer is a nice guy who has done a very good job here.' Mr Santer's record on the European stage is easily underestimated. In 1985, he chaired the negotiations leading to the Single European Act, playing a useful role in persuading the then British prime minister, Mrs Margaret Thatcher, to drop her reservations about the move towards more majority voting on EU laws. He argued, successfully, that the loss of sovereignty was worth exchanging for the prize of a barrier-free internal market. It was during Luxembourg's six-month presidency of the European Union in 1991 that much of the groundwork was done for the Maastricht treaty on political and monetary union. British officials recall that Mr Santer and his team stood out in favour of the 'pillar system' - the term used to describe the separation of supranational decision-making (trade, agriculture, competition policy) and looser inter-governmental co-operation on foreign policy, defence, justice and immigration. Mr Santer is a federalist - but only if it means preserving local and national powers in sensitive areas. He prefers the old Treaty of Rome term, 'European Community', to the new, Maastricht-inspired 'European Union', which implies not so much about loose co-operation and more about the direction of integration. 'The big difference with Delors is that Santer does not come from the French centralising tradition,' says a colleague of the prime minister. As Mr Santer told the Luxemburger Wort newspaper this week: 'For me, federalism is the opposite of centralism. To help the process of European integration does not mean to usher in a Napoleonic Europe. The more Europe is decentralised, the stronger it is.' Such sentiments will endear him not only to British Euro-sceptics, but also to the foes of Brussels centralism who have become more vocal in France, Germany and Italy since the agreement on the Maastricht treaty in December 1991. His political beliefs spring from a deep conviction that Luxembourg has thrived in the EU, precisely because it has avoided being submerged by a central authority or swamped by its larger neighbours, France and Germany. This conviction explains the Grand Duchy's resistance to German-led calls for an EU-wide withholding tax, which would mean scrapping the tax privileges offered to foreign savers (and stemming the flow of Deutschemarks into Luxembourg). Mr Santer has made clear that Luxembourg will only agree to a new harmonised tax if it is extended to other OECD tax havens such as the Channel Islands, Gibraltar, Lichtenstein, Monaco, and Switzerland. 'There will be no deal between Mr Santer and Chancellor Kohl on withholding tax,' predicts Mr Lucien Thiel, general manager of the Luxembourg Bankers Association. Luxembourgers predict that Mr Santer will be a little more independent than expected, if only because he has been a member of the exclusive club of the 12 heads of EU government (known as the European Council) since 1985. 'He will listen to the big chiefs, but he will not be a puppet on the string of Helmut Kohl and (French President) Francois Mitterrand,' said a colleague. Still, there is an undercurrent of disbelief that a country with only 400,000 people has supplied a second president of the Commission in 14 years. Some fear a backlash against Luxembourg, which is already over-represented in terms of institutions and voting weights in EU decision-making. 'A new Burgermeister is coming to Brussels,' summed up one Commission official yesterday. In fairness, Luxembourg is merely fulfilling its historical role. In the Middle Ages, several counts from the House of Luxembourg were called upon to serve as successive German emperors, because they were compromise candidates who came from a country which did not represent a threat to the Greater Powers. As Mr Delors might say: 'Plus ca change en Europe.'</p>

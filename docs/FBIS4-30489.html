			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with economic critic Katsuto Uchihashi by </F> unidentified reporter; place and date not given: "Rough Road to  an Affluent Nation"]    [Text] [Boxed item: "Five-Year Program for an  Affluent Nation." This program was approved by the Miyazawa  cabinet in June 1992 on the basis of a report submitted by the  Economic Council. The program provided for the major objective  of diverting emphasis from a corporate society that stressed  efficiency to a society that emphasized the perspective of  individuals and consumers, and it suggested the basic direction  for management of the economy until fiscal year 1996 calling for  improvement of the living environment and shortening of work  hours. Specific goals included land measures to enable the  purchase of quality homes in urban areas at a cost of five times  the average annual salary and shortening annual work hours to  1,800. An increase in cost burden of the program goals to be  imposed on the public was considered inevitable, but was to be  minimized to the degree possible.]    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] I see that in your book Failure or  Recovery--Urgent Proposals for the Japanese Economy, you  assert that an affluent nation is not feasible as an extension  of a Japanese-style economic giant.    [Uchihashi] I believe that we were able to become an  economic  giant because we chose a method that kept us from becoming an  affluent nation. We cannot hope to become an affluent nation  just because we succeeded in becoming an economic giant.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Just what are you trying to say?    In postwar Japan, ultra-low-interest policies were used to  provide industry with low-cost funds through financial  institutions. As a result, industry was able to build production  facilities which were adequate in terms of international  competition. "Operations using the buying power of underlying  assets" in the form of the collateral value of differences  between book value and market price was also encouraged. On the  other hand, low-interest rates on savings and soaring land  prices obstructed household efforts to accumulate wealth and  families were forced to buy goods at prices that exceeded export  prices. Unless we take measures to alter this transfer of income  from households to industry, goals such as emphasis on the  individual and consumer as stated in the Five-Year Program for  an Affluent Nation will merely serve as catchphrases.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] On the other hand, I hear that erstwhile  growth policies have reached their limits.    [Uchihashi] It has come to the point where the Japanese  economic specialty of pursuing the effects of mass production is  no longer effective. Specifically, automobile, electronic  equipment, and machine tool manufacturers would compete in the  world market by increasing production and attaining growth  through reducing manufacturing costs on a unit basis. However,  the makers now face a situation in which the costs of pursuing  the effects of mass production now exceed the benefits of such  mass production.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Why is it that they have reached such a  limit?    [Uchihashi] Continuing pursuit of the benefits of mass  production requires a massive consumption market, but the  domestic market has ceased to grow. The U.S. market had served  as a bottomless consumer of the difference in Japanese domestic  supply and demand, but the United States under the Clinton  administration nows says that they do not welcome such an  approach. On the other hand, the marketing approach of  generating replacement buying through design changes on a short  four-year cycle is no longer effective. In addition to the  inability to borrow based on undeclared book value which has  made fund procurement more difficult, the cost of capital  expansion has also skyrocketed.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the switch to  dependency  on the Asian market?    [Uchihashi] Considering the present situation in which  dependence on the U.S. markets has hit a brick wall and direct  investments in Asia have increased sharply in response to the  strong yen, the industrial world hinges its future on the  formation of a yen-based Asian economic sphere. However, I feel  any attempt of that nature will not succeed. East Asia already  comes under the U.S. sphere of influence and is a member of the  dollar-based economic sphere. Excessive export-dependence-style  growth structures are also unsustainable. In the future, we need  to establish strong consumer markets in Japan.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What sort of ideas do you have in that  respect?    [Uchihashi] We need to build social capital systems that  rest  on concepts that minimize social costs, such as those arising  from commuter congestion and traffic accidents, by providing  roadways that permit the coexistence of people and vehicles such  as those in Europe which are partitioned into two-level, triple  conduits providing for movement of people, bicycles and  motorcycles, and motor vehicles. I am speaking of building a new  infrastructure that gives priority to conditions conducive to  providing for comfortable lifestyles and attendant expansion in  domestic demand. Further, as is the case with the German  Workers' Property Formation System, the program should provide  for construction of urban environments and aggressive government  promotion of preferential fiscal and tax treatment for formation  of individual assets such as privately owned homes, thus  contributing to the building of a strong consumer society.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] It appears that you also foresee a change in  the environment for businesses.    [Uchihashi] Strong competitors for businesses such as  consumer cooperatives have arrived on the scene. People have  come to realize that businesses are not the only providers of  goods and services. I also think that, as the unemployment rate  climbs, we will see the formation of workers cooperatives which  will allow workers themselves to take the initiative in finding  new employment. Government assistance to be extended to such  organizations will also mostly likely become policy issues.</p>

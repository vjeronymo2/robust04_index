			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sydney, Jan. 20 KYODO -- Annual iron ore price  negotiations between Australian iron ore suppliers and Japanese  steelmakers were deadlocked this week following "a fundamental  difference in views of the market," an industry source said  Thursday [20 January].    Australian negotiators are arguing that increased demand in  other markets for their iron ore should have an effect on  prices, while Japanese buyers say that a continued downturn in  sales in 1994 will result in further "substantial" price cuts,  the source said.    "We see that for 1994 the iron ore market is at worst evenly  balanced" between supply and demand, an industry source said.  "The Japanese believe that the market is soft. They're  allowing their own difficult circumstances to color that  perception," he said.    Contending with continued financial difficulties, the  Japanese steel mills still set the prices, buying some 50  million metric tons of iron ore from Australia each year. Last  year they won a 10 percent drop in prices. But Australian  negotiators believe that China's place in the market must now be  considered. The Australians believe that China will take up the  iron ore that the Japanese do not want, leading them to believe  that there is no room for a price decrease.    China is expected to increase its annual purchase of iron  ore  from 28 million tons last year to approximately 34 million tons  in 1994.    Australian negotiators believe that the tight supply-demand  balance in the rest of the world could even justify a slight  increase in prices.    Meanwhile, they are interpreting their Japanese  counterparts'  description of a "substantial" cut to mean a 10 percent drop.    Australian negotiators are prepared to factor in Japan's  economic difficulties but are refusing to consider any  modification while Japan insists on "substantial" cuts, the  source said.    "So, the way forward would be for us to form a common view  of  the market," the source said.    Negotiations will resume at the end of the month.</p>

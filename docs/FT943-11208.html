			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Working Life: Marlowe fans strut their stuff - Interiors Electric fans work wonders in environments which lack efficient air-conditioning. But, as with umbrellas, you never think about them until you need one. When a really sweltering day arrives, the tendency is to buy the first fan you can find. As the seasons change, this unappealing object is then stored in some inaccessible cupboard. Far better to buy a handsome-looking fan that you will want to keep on display all year. Highly effective in stirring life into air on even the muggiest days, the Cinni all-metal electric fan also provides a treat for the eye. It is pleasingly old-fashioned with gleaming steel blades whirling inside a circular wire cage. This solidly-built design classic is one fan you won't want to hide away when autumn comes. Viewing the fan head as it steadily oscillates through 90 degrees, there is a temptation to imagine oneself as Philip Marlowe awaiting a dangerously curvaceous client on a sticky LA night. In fact RK Narayan or Vikram Seth are more appropriate to bring to mind since the Cinni range is manufactured in Varanasi, India. The only drawback is price. Table-top versions range from the tiny 200mm fan (Pounds 100 chrome, Pounds 82.50 black) to the larger 400mm model (Pounds 138.75 chrome, Pounds 117 black). Most impressive is the 400mm pedestal fan which stands 4ft high and at full blast creates a turbulence which would register double figures on the Beaufort scale (Pounds 225 chrome, Pounds 185 black.) Imported by the Freud Shop, 198 Shaftesbury Avenue, London, WC2 (Tel: 071-831 1071,) Cinni fans are also sold by John Lewis, The Conran Shop, Heals, Harrods and Leading Edge stores. Ceiling-mounted versions are available from the Freud Shop. A 1,500mm-diameter fan with splendid gold trim costs only Pounds 150. If you are not too concerned about looks, there are plenty of plastic fans which do much the same job as the Cinni for around a quarter the price. The Pifco range, for example, includes a 6in clip-on fan (Pounds 16.99), a 12in table fan (Pounds 34.99) and a 16in pedestal fan (Pounds 49.99). Unfortunately, they have about as much character as a paper cup. One of the more unusual designs of electric fan is the Goldair Vertical Oscillating Fan (Pounds 69.50). Made in China, it measures about 3ft high by 6in square. When operating, the whole squat column turns through 90 degrees. Though advertised as giving 'vibration-free operation', the one displayed in John Lewis, Oxford Street, had a decidedly wobbly action. While adding to the entertainment of office life, there would always be the possibility of the Goldair setting off for a robotic stroll in order to chat up the photocopier. Just Pounds 4.95 will buy you a Jegs Handfan, which seems to work well as long as you don't mind looking like a modern-day pasha. At the opposite end of the price scale is the Carrier Holiday: (Pounds 999 from Selfridges), described as a 'portable air conditioner', ('wheelable' would be more accurate). While providing an instant arctic blast, it ejects an equal flow of hot air from a plastic pipe at the back which has to be expelled through an open window.</p>

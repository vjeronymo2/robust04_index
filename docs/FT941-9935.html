			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: Electronic Arts to acquire Broderbund Electronic Arts, the leading US video and computer games software company, is to acquire rival Broderbund Software, best known for its popular computer games. The merger will form the world's largest consumer software company. Broderbund will become a subsidiary of Electronic Arts in a stock swap valued at Dollars 400m. The merger is expected to be completed by the end of May. Both companies are in the forefront of interactive multi- media. Electronic Arts publishes games for personal computers and Nintendo and Sega video game machines. Broderbund has pioneered the field of 'edutainment,' games with educational value. For the past year, Electronic Arts has competed directly with Broderbund with its own educational titles. Analysts said, however, that they do not anticipate that the merger will raise anti-trust problems. The merger comes as Microsoft, the leading personal computer software company, plans to launch 150 new products for home computers aimed at children and families.</p>

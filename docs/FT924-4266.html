			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Union drops anti-Japanese stance MSF, THE general technical union, has signed a single-union, no-strike deal with the Japanese company Toray Textiles Europe. The union once denounced Japanese company councils and no-strike agreements as 'alien practices'. Toray Textiles will soon open its third British plant at a greenfield site in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, employing about 400 people. MSF, the 600,000-strong union representing mainly white-collar and professional staff, beat the GMB general union and Knitwear Workers Union to secure the deal. It is the first it has signed for blue-collar workers. The agreement includes a classic Japanese-style no-strike deal under which failure to agree on pay or conditions will lead to external conciliation. If unresolved, the dispute leads to 'pendulum arbitration' at Acas, the conciliation service. Pendulum arbitration means the proposal of one side must be chosen, but no compromise can be accepted. Mr Roger Lyons, MSF general secretary, distanced himself yesterday from comments made by his predecessor, Mr Ken Gill, at last year's TUC Congress attacking Japanese company councils. 'I'm not going to be held accountable for statements made in a personal capacity by my predecessor,' he said. He emphasised that 'things are moving on' in other areas of union policy, rejecting claims that MSF, along with other unions, was behaving hypocritically over no-strike deals. He stressed that, unlike many such deals, Toray is allowing the participation of full-time union officials on the company council and union involvement in training. The EETPU - the electrical section of the AEEU craft union, which was criticised by other unions when it pioneered deals like the Toray one in the early 1980s - took satisfaction from yesterday's announcement. Mr Paul Gallagher, the electricians' leader, said: 'I'm surprised but delighted that MSF have stopped seeing inward investors as 'aliens', which was their previous policy.' The return to the TUC of the electricians' section of the AEEU craft union will probably be eased by the likely withdrawal of the non-TUC journalists' union, the Institute of Journalists, from the Federation of Professional Associations, run by the electricians section of the AEEU. The TUC journalists' union, the National Union of Journalists, has been leading the fight to keep the electricians out of the TUC because of its link with the IOJ.</p>

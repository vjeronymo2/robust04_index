			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Portugal prepares austerity budget THE Portuguese government is preparing a tough cost-cutting 1993 budget to reduce its deficit in a further effort to accelerate nominal economic convergence with Portugal's richer European Community partners. 'It (will be) an investment and restructuring budget,' Mr Jorge Braga de Macedo, finance minister, said in an interview with the Semanario Economico newspaper. 'Recurrent expenditure will fall in nominal terms, but investment and spending on social services will grow 12-14 per cent.' According to officials, the aim is to reduce the budget deficit to 4 per cent of gross domestic product, compared with 5.2 per cent forecast for this year. All ministries, except justice and interior, will be required to cut their administrative spending by 5 per cent. The right-of-centre social democratic administration is also seeking public sector wage rises of up to 4.5 per cent for most employees and of about 5.5 per cent for the lowest-paid. This is likely to be bitterly fought by public sector unions, which do not believe the minister's forecast of 5-7 per cent inflation for 1993 - down from 9 per cent expected this year. Mr Braga de Macedo said he expected the economy to grow by about 3 per cent in 1993, compared with forecasts of 2-2.5 per cent growth this year.</p>

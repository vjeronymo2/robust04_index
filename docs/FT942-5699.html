			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / British Chambers of Commerce annual meeting: Ashdown urges training takeover Chambers of commerce should take over the Training and Enterprise Councils which administer government training schemes in England and Wales, Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said yesterday. He urged a greater role for local business in determining not only the pattern of education and training but also of local infrastructure investment. He also argued for chambers of commerce to be given a statutory role, as they have in Germany - a suggestion advocated by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, when he was out of office. Mr Ashdown said companies would have to belong to the local chamber and in return they would have the benefit of a single voice when speaking to government and a single framework for training. The chambers, he said, 'should take on responsibilities for the Tecs themselves'. There are 82 employer-led Tecs in England and Wales, which have increasingly taken a role in local economic development as well as training since their creation just more than three years ago. Mr Ashdown also said the Liberal Democrats would legislate to make interest payable on overdue debt, a step which the government rejected in its white paper on competitiveness. But he made his strongest comments as part of an advocation for a stronger voice for the UK in the European Union. This is a subject about which smaller companies have a distinctly cool view, a sur-vey by the British Chambers of Commerce found yester-day. The survey of 364 small companies found 72 per cent opposed to the EU becoming responsible for wider areas of policy. But 60 per cent of the companies said they had not been affected by the single European market and slightly more did not know the name of their member of the European parliament. More than half of them claimed to have had no benefits from the single market.</p>

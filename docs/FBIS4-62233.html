			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yelena Berezneva: "Expect a Big One. Vice </F> Premier A. Zaveryukha Promises Russia Will Have Its Own Grain in  Abundance"]    [Text] At the beginning of May the bulletins on spring  field work in a number of regions resembled dispatches from the  front:    Rain in Kirov Oblast is proving a serious obstacle to  sowing.    Equipment readiness in Novgorod Oblast is very  unsatisfactory. One-third of tractors and trucks are out of  action. The fuel and seed situation is critical owing to the  tardy provision of credits.    In Bryansk Oblast a shortage of mineral fertilizers (some  farms can only meet 10 percent of their needs) could reduce the  grain yield by more than one-third.    The Orenburg farmers have won back some tracts of land from  the spring floods and attacked the furrows, but the situation is  complicated by the fact around two million hectares of scheduled  fall plowing was not carried out last year.    The workload is enormous, while the countryside is  experiencing more than just the traditional problems with spare  parts, fuel, and seed. The main problem both for kolkhozes and  for private farmers is finance and materials for the spring  sowing which is already under way. But there are other problems  as well. According to Buryat republic plant protection station  data, a massive plague of locusts is expected in the fields.  Modern chemicals to combat locusts have been purchased, but the  treatment of the land has been delayed because of the shortage  of fuel....    Spring has brought some very unsettled weather to the North  Caucasus, the Central Chernozem area, and southern part of the  Volga area. According to Agriculture Ministry data, nearly  one-fifth ( a little over twice as much as last year) of the  sowings of winter crops in Russia is either dead or too thin.  Winter crops have suffered most, as we know, in the breadbasket  oblasts of Belgorod, Voronezh, Rostov, and Volgograd, and also  in the Kuban -- between 29 and 40 percent.    It was confirmed by the Agriculture Ministry arable farming  main administration that the pace of this year's sowing work is  somewhat higher than last year. But because of the lack of  money natural resources are slow to get to farms. Only 16,500  tonnes of spring grain crop seed have been delivered -- more  than 100,000 tonnes are required. Farmers are still missing  one-third of their seed beets and one-half of their corn seed.    The schedule for supplies of lubricants had been only  50-percent implemented by the end of April. The tractor pool is  64,000 down on last year. There are 28,000 fewer plows, 44,000  fewer cultivators, and 41,000 fewer seeders.    The land is being worked to death. By 5 May only 69 million  tonnes of organic fertilizers had been spread on the fields,  which is half as much as in the first four months of 1993.  There has been a 50-percent reducion also in the liming of  fields and the provision of mineral fertilizers. Fertilizer  application this year will be 75 percent down on the average for  1986-1990. For that reason alone the shortfall in the grain  harvest could be 13-15 million tonnes, according to Agriculture  Ministry expert forecasts.    Nonetheless, Vice Premier A. Zaveryukha's forecasts were  optimistic when he spoke with journalists the other day. He  announced that this year's sowing of grain crops is one million  hectares ahead of last year's pace. Despite the very difficult  weather conditions and unprecedented financial and material  problems Russia will have its own grain this year. The gross  harvest should be 90-100 million tonnes. The country does not  intend to buy any grain abroad. The government is expecting its  own commodity producer -- the Russian peasant -- to feed us this  time.    If our commercial structures go about importing grain, that  is their business. If the West provides some extra grain in the  form of humanitarian assistance, no one will object. But the  state will not spend a kopek more on grain imports, Zaveryukha  stressed repeatedly.    On the one hand this optimism will seem to many to be  premature and unwarranted -- the reports from the regions are  very worrying, after all. Maybe he should not be forecasting a  decent Russian harvest when the sowing campaign is not even  over. The grain harvest is counted in the fall, as everybody  knows. And we in Russia waste up to 50 percent of the crop,  according to Academician A. Nikonov, director of the agrarian  institute.    On the other hand I personally find A. Zaveryukha's optimism  reassuring. Thank goodness, the government has at last found a  voice, formed its own position: Make plans with the support of  the peasants for a more efficient sector, beginning with the  practice of providing harvest credits, right through to  integrating production, the processing industry, and trade.    Four to six weeks ago the impression was that the executive  authorities' eyelids would droop whenever there was a mention of  a program to develop the agroindustrial complex, not reacting at  all to the call to help a countryside that had been bled white.  The government is no longer silent. So I would like to believe  in harvest-94. No matter how unrealistic today's good forecasts  may appear.    ...It is an amazing country with an amazing countryside. Not  long ago the people feared that there might be no sowing at all,  because there was no equipment, fertilizer, or seed and no money  to buy it all. But no. Field work is in progress. And, most  amazing of all, at a faster pace than last year.</p>

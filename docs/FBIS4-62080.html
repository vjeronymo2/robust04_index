			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Viktor Novoseltsev, executive director of the </F> newspaper PRAVDA ZHIRINOVSKOGO: "What Lies Behind Mr.  Navrozov's `Superarticle?'"]    [Text] In his very long article entitled "Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy, Super-Hitler and Super-Stalin?" in ROSSIYSKIYE  VESTI nos. 71-73 for 20-22 April this year, Mr. Navrozov invites  all those who want to to enter into polemics in order to "smash  them to smithereens." Responding to this call, I spent a long  time rereading this accumulation of stories in order to get a  hold on something about which I could argue. The "superarticle"  was indeed a slow read, you had to concentrate in order to grasp  the real reasons why the article was written -- reasons  abundantly flooded with dirty "water." And the reasons were  quite understandable: Mr. Kozlovskiy, who praises Zhirinovskiy  both moderately and immoderately, has become popular in the  United States, where Mr. Navrozov obviously considers himself to  be the sole expresser of Russian thinking. Which is why he was  "smashed to smithereens" by the famous author who has "published  over 200 articles in 14 Russian publications."    The ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI editorial office asked V. Zhirinovskiy  "to put his counterarguments and arguments" in the newspaper but  if the party's leader were to "counterargue" and "argue" in the  pages of all newspapers in which the authors of such "studies"  pour dirt on him, he would need at least 30 hours of strenuous  work a day. That would be a good gift for our political rivals.    Mr. Navrozov undoubtedly considers himself a specialist in  everything which concerns the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of  Russia] and its leader, but it is very strange that in his  accusations he relies on "a publication with the charming name  `Off With Their Heads' [`k toporu']." That publication has  never been an LDPR organ and was published by former LDPR member  S. Zharikov, who left the party because of his extreme  right-wing convictions. That publication has never had anything  to do with the LDPR. If Mr. Navrozov had really been seeking  the truth he would have found it in his own home in the United  States in the "Viktor Kamkin" bookstore, well known to all  emigres. The store regularly sells the newspaper PRAVDA  ZHIRINOVSKOGO, the official organ of the LDPR. If the  "specialist on our issue" wants to dig through our old  publications we will be pleased to offer him a full selection of  our newspaper's issues, which do not contain a line calling for  war or racial or national hatred. Only the truth.    It is strange that Mr. Navrozov has decided to publish his  article in Russia. If it had been published in the United  States and had frightened the Americans the aim sought by the  author would have been achieved 100 percent. Another wave of  hatred and fear would have been stirred up. But what is the aim  of the author in publishing in Russia an article which contains  not a trace of anguish for the hungry and humiliated citizens of  that country, in which each line contains concern only for  citizens of Jewish nationality? That article will produce  nothing but another wave of ordinary anti-Semitism and if that  was the author's main purpose he can consider it achieved.    The LDPR's program and its leader's statements do not  contain  a hint of discrimination against citizens for ethnic reasons, on  the contrary the program declares "the right to preserve  traditions and customs, to develop one's own ethnic culture and  freedom of religion." That is what Zhirinovskiy is blamed for.  It turns out that Hitler too failed to warn the Jews he would  destroy them. Forgive me, but what then of the presumption of  innocence? Mr. Navrozov condemns Zhirinovskiy for intentions he  has not voiced, guided solely by his own convictions formed from  reading some dubious publications which have nothing in common  with the LDPR. Proceeding from that principle one can accuse any  party and any leader of criminal intentions, seeking dubious  analogies in our history. What the author calls "the threat to  the West" is called in the language of international relations a  policy from a position of strength and was used by the United  States in Grenada, Panama, and Cuba, and today under the UN flag  the United States is pursuing this same policy the author finds  unacceptable in Somalia and Yugoslavia. Zhirinovskiy merely  expressed an intention, but the United States is already  pursuing that policy, yet the author is more frightened by  Zhirinovskiy's intentions than by the U.S. Government's specific  actions.    Zhirinovskiy does not intend to "destroy the West" or to  fight it. It will be enough for our party if the West  interferes less in our strictly domestic affairs, especially  since "specialists" like Mr. Navrozov are turning to us more  frequently with their advice, thanks to which we are in our  present situation.    All accusations of chauvinism, nazism, and the desire for  world dominance are unfounded. It is simply foolish to accuse  Zhirinovskiy of seeking world dominance. In each of his  speeches and publications the LDPR leader accuses the United  States of this desire and expresses himself in favor of regional  cooperation between countries in order to rule out global  military conflicts and criticizes the former USSR leadership for  attempting to extend its influence to the whole world, which was  one reason for the state's collapse.    The author's opinions on the "superfluidity" of  Zhirinovskiy's thinking are surprising. It is very rash of him  to accuse the LDPR leader of being disloyal to his ideas or  statements. In Russia today Zhirinovskiy is one of the few  party leaders, if not the only party leader, not to have changed  his position by a single degree in four years. His tactics of  struggle change, conditions change, the state is collapsing,  former comrades in arms are shooting each other, political  leaders are changing color more often than trees in the course  of a year, but the LDPR is prepared to put its name to every  document which has emerged from the party's nether regions in  this time. What place is there here for the lack of principle  of which the author tries to accuse Zhirinovskiy?    The "appeal to the officers and employees of the special  services and special subunits of the counterintelligence organs  and Internal Affairs Ministry." Mr. Navrozov explains it as a  call to compile lists of people to be destroyed, although the  document made no mention of any "destruction" but merely  contained an appeal to uncover the criminals who are robbing our  people and to do their immediate job of eradicating crime, and  retribution in accordance with the law will come for today's  mafiosi only after the LDPR has come to power, because of the  present leadership's inability to fight this evil. Any patriot  will support this appeal and it can only frighten Mr. Navrozov's  friends, the "new emigres" who are flocking into defenseless  Russia in order, under the guise of "U.S. businessmen," to catch  a free fish in Russia's murky waters. The freeloading will soon  end for them and they will have to answer to the U.S. tax  administration.    The notorious article devoted a lot of room to the problem  of  selling arms abroad. Nothing about hunger in Russia, nothing  about the Russian children who are not being born today, nothing  about our destroyed economy, but a lot of space devoted to the  problem of arms sales. It is true that our weapons are better  than the Americans'. For the time being. And we will sell  them, and if we do not then the Americans will and it will be  the worse for us, but Navrozov will feel better. And there is  no point in arguing about whether there will be money from arms  sales. If we do not sell arms there will be no money and the  military industry will wither away. Not bad thing for those who  are paying Mr. Navrozov money for his articles.    And the transatlantic journalist completely disconcerted me  with his conclusion: The Russian press, he says, writes good  things about Zhirinovskiy and does not write bad things because  it is mortally afraid of that gentleman. That's the limit. If  Zhirinovskiy were to set himself the task of simply reading all  the dirty articles about him published in the Russian press he  would have not time even to wash, let alone to work. Yes, some  people do write the truth, but they are few even in the  provinces where a conscience has not yet become a source of  laughter. Moscow journalists cannot allow themselves that  luxury. As for our "red-brown" press, as the authors puts it,  we are indeed make efforts not through fear but for the sake of  our conscience, the only thing is that under the present regime  this is difficult in the face of the "yellow" press.    Mr. Navrozov from the height of his moral position  complained  that the word "dictatorship" which sounds like the word  "slavery" to Americans is an ordinary word to Russian ears, but  he has forgotten to add that U.S. democracy found its feet by  relying for a whole century on the forced labor of slaves. The  fine articles of their constitution did not prevent the  democratic Americans from using people with a different color  skin as work animals. The American path of development is  unacceptable to Russia, we do not intend to rob other peoples by  exporting cheap raw material from underdeveloped countries in  exchange for chewing gum, and the Americans would not allow us  to do so, realizing that two such parasitical states will not  survive on one earth. The best option for the United States is  a weak Russia mining its own mineral resources for U.S. needs  and for that to happen the United States needs to "keep" its own  man in the Kremlin, but if Zhirinovskiy gets there....    Mr. Navrozov's article is correct. For the Americans. It  was for them that he wrote it.    In approaching one more subject which, in my opinion, seems  the main one in the article I am criticizing, you cannot help  feeling awkward. In Russia you can openly call the Russians  cattle and Russia a land of fools (or the motherland of goats,  as MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS did) if you are a citizen of another  nationality but god forbid that a Russian say anything  prejudiced about a person of another nationality. You will  immediately be known as a fascist. And dragged through the  courts. So Russians are tying themselves into knots in their  own country, thinking up terms like "persons of a criminal (or  commercial) nationality."    Our party is in favor of full equality for people  irrespective of sexual, racial, ethnic, or religious  differences, but for that we must first of all give Russians  equal rights wit regard to other ethnic groups. We must abandon  the double standards for treating ethnic groups, we must allow  Russians to rid themselves of their occupiers' complex. After  all, we were not the ones who killed Indian children to acquire  their ancestors'land, we were not the ones who used Africans as  working animals. We worked on the outskirts of the empire in  the same way and perhaps even better than others and we deserve  equal rights with other peoples living on the same land as us.    The aim of Navrozov's article is not only to discredit  Zhirinovskiy. The topic of Zhirinovskiy is only the tip of the  iceberg. The author persistently puffs up the Jewish topic,  dividing the world into Jews and non-Jews. Presenting the  fascist challenge banner to the Russian people, he is convinced  this banner will never fly over a zionist movement thanks to the  enormous harm done to the Jewish nation by German  national-socialism. Yet far more Russians were killed in that  war! A double standard again? We should all know the  description of national-socialism adopted in Germany today:  "National-socialism is the determination of a person's  nationality on the basis of his blood." In that connection what  do the Jews' attempts to "accuse" Zhirinovskiy of being a Jew  look like? And in general what is the purpose of this whole  campaign? To prove that such a talented man could only appear  in a Jewish environment or, by using ordinary anti-Semitism, to  turn Russian voters away from a leader they do not like? Both  purposes are undoubtedly vile and in addition are a very clear  example of double-dyed national-socialism of the German type.    The charge leveled against Mr. Kozlovskiy that "in a good 20  years in the West he never once spoke of his national origin" is  also loathsome. From that it follows that a Jew who does not  advertize his nationality is violating some special Jewish laws  while a Russian who asserts that he is Russian is transgressing  some other Jewish laws. The double standard once again, and it  stinks.    Somehow it is unseemly even to mention the literary worth of  this article. Reading Navrozov is harder than listening to  Gorbachev. I feel very sorry for our emigres who encounter this  kind of thing in "Russian" newspapers. I want to advise Mr.  Navrozov not to take the trouble to paraphrase Russian sayings.  The saying "the elder tree is in the yard and uncle is in Kiev"  of itself signifies the meaningless nature of what has been said  and does not require the interference of "specialists," and nor  indeed does anything concerning our domestic life.</p>

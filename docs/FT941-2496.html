			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Serbs open UN aid route to Maglaj Moscow's importance in the Yugoslav peace process was underlined yesterday when Bosnian Serbs allowed a UN aid convoy access to the besieged Moslem-held enclave of Maglaj in north-central Bosnia. About 20,000 people had been trapped there by joint Serb and Croat offensives since last autumn. Last week, Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russia's special envoy to the former Yugoslavia, warned the Bosnian Serbs that they had to take a more 'constructive approach' in the peace process. Access by the UN convoy to Maglaj also follows Russia's broader attempts to persuade President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia to decide when, and how, he is prepared to sue for peace. That would lead to an overall regional settlement. As part of this process, Mr Churkin is expected to hold talks tomorrow with Croatian officials, and with Serb leaders from the self-styled republic of Krajina in south-western Croatia. Mr Churkin wants to persuade Croatian leaders to grant wide autonomy to Serbs in Croatia. In return, Serbia might be persuaded to sign a peace treaty with Zagreb.</p>

			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> AETNA RESUMES SALES OF NEW POLICIES IN STATE  </P> <P> Aetna Life &amp; Casualty, the ninth largest seller of property and casualty  insurance in California, said Wednesday it is resuming sales to new customers  of auto, homeowners and commercial liability policies.  </P> <P> The announcement ended a two-week moratorium on such sales while the company  evaluated how the state Supreme Court decision upholding most of Proposition  103 would be enforced.  </P> <P> A company spokesman, Jason Wright, said Aetna had concluded from statements  made May 11 by state Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie that the state  intends to allow the insurance industry a fair rate of return in California for  each line of insurance.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'More Comfortable New'  </P> <P> "Our halt in new sales was temporary, while we awaited a substantive statement  on how the state intended to operate," said Wright from Aetna headquarters in  Hartford, Conn. "We're more comfortable now."  </P> <P> He said the company is particularly pleased that California will allow a profit  on each line of insurance in deciding whether to exempt each company from the  20% rate rollbacks from 1987 levels called for in Proposition 103.  </P> <P> Aetna will file for an exemption and for continuation of "pretty much" the  rates it charges now, the spokesman said.  </P> <P> Numerous insurers have expressed satisfaction at Gillespie's decision to allow  a profit for each line of insurance, while a number of consumer groups have  criticized the decision on grounds that the industry had traditionally been  willing to sell some lines at a loss in a move to induce customers to also buy  more profitable lines.  </P> <P> Aetna last year sold $103 million of private passenger auto insurance in  California, $64 million of homeowners insurance and $451 million of commercial  liability insurance. The moratorium on new sales affected only a small fraction  of that business, since policies already in force continued to be renewed  during the two-week period.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, another leading insurer, USAA, confirmed reports that it has stopped  paying safe-driver dividends to 170,000 of its California auto insurance  customers, due to what a company spokesman termed "uncertainties surrounding  Proposition 103."  </P> <P> Although the initiative requires all companies to begin giving a 20% "good  driver" discount after Nov. 8, the immediate effect of USAA's decision is to  raise its safe drivers by about 10% on their premiums during the interim.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Exempted Californians  </P> <P> The USAA spokesman added that the company had paid a special one-time homeowner  dividend to its homeowner policyholders earlier in the year, but had exempted  the 104,000 Californians who would have otherwise received it "due to  uncertainties surrounding Proposition 103."  </P> <P> He did not elaborate on what uncertainties he was referring to, although  Gillespie has each company's rates under review pending her determination  whether what companies, if any, will be forced to comply with the rate  rollbacks called for by Proposition 103.  </P></p>

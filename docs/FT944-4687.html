			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Hazlewood halved at Pounds 10.7m - Problems at four plants, now solved, cost group Pounds 7m in first half Problems at four UK plants helped to halve Hazlewood Foods interim profits. Mr John Simons, the former finance director who took over as UK chief executive in September, said yesterday that the problems had cost the group Pounds 7m. However, all four problem areas had now been sorted out. Pre-tax profits for the six months to October 1 fell from Pounds 23.3m to Pounds 10.7m, while total sales grew from Pounds 403.9m to Pounds 426.1m. Excluding exceptionals, profits were Pounds 12.1m (Pounds 25.6m). Sales from continuing operations were ahead from Pounds 390.9m to Pounds 414m. The group said it had returned two of the problem plants to profit - the Sheffield sausage factory and the Wrexham ready meals plant. The Hilliers plant in Plymouth, which makes chilled pies and quiches, was breaking even at the end of the half following losses which at one time hit Pounds 90,000 a week. The salad processor in Waltham Abbey was sold. 'We made a small loss in the first quarter,' said Mr Simons. 'But we have come back to substantial profitability after taking these actions.' Produce was the only one of the group's eight operating divisions to show an increase in operating profits and margins, making Pounds 5m (Pounds 3.3m) on sales of Pounds 35.4m (Pounds 37.8m). The ready meals division fell into the red to the tune of Pounds 1.1m, compared with a profit of Pounds 6.3m. The result was hit by the Wrexham plant problems, a depressed ice cream market, and raw material costs at Fri D'Or, the Dutch potato processor. The non-food division, which makes nappies and other paper goods, was also hit by raw material increases which sent it Pounds 100,000 into the red (Pounds 1.5m profit). Grocery division profits fell to Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 4.3m), hit by price rises of up to 50 per cent for soft fruit for jam making, and by a falling market for pickles. Mr Simons said the group had now tidied up most of the peripheral problems, and had established itself as a strong competitor in the convenient food and ready meal markets. 'The team is very confident that this will lead to a better second half performance.' Earnings a share fell from 6.94p to 3.27p. The interim dividend is unchanged at 2.4p. COMMENT The past 12 months have been traumatic for Hazlewood. Its response to mounting problems has been reasonably rapid, and its has brought in new blood and attacked its cost base. After a great deal of work, the group is climbing out of the hole it dug for itself. But the pressures will continue, not least from raw material price increases, particularly in packaging. The trouble appears to be that the group is a hotch-potch of relatively small businesses, with no critical mass in any single one, although it will argue that 60 per cent of sales now come from the targetted ready meals sector. Profit forecasts for the full year range from Pounds 29m to Pounds 39m, so it is probably now best considered as a yield stock. An unchanged dividend gives a yield of 8 per cent, which is below that of the similarly struggling Albert Fisher.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (h)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Roads and walkways. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Good all-weather roads should be provided. Only roads serving a single magazine or explosives processing building (including its service facilities) may dead end, and then, only at the magazine or building. The road system should be designed to make it unnecessary to pass through an explosives area to travel from one place to another. Walkways and roads at the entrance to or between adjacent buildings containing explosives should be boardwalks or hard surfaced, preventing employees from tracking stones, grit, and other foreign material into operating buildings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Windows and skylights. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Non-shatterable glazing is preferred where an explosion accompanied by falling or projected glass could cause injury. When glazing with conventional glass is used, the hazard may be reduced by covering it with properly fixed plastic or wire mesh screening. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Drains and sumps. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) All drain lines handling explosive wastes shall have sumps or basins of sufficient capacity for the removal of explosives by settling. The drains shall be of adequate capacity; free of pockets; and with slopes of at least one-quarter inch per foot to prevent explosives settling-out in the drain line, rather than in the sump or settling basin intended to collect them. Sumps shall be so designed that suspended and settleable solid explosive material cannot be carried beyond the sumps in the wash waters, and so overflow shall not disturb any floating solids. The settling rate of the material and the usual rate of flow shall be taken into account in determining the sump's capacity. The design shall also permit easy removal of collected explosives, and shall allow for retention of those that float on water until they can be skimmed off. Bolted sump tanks or other types of construction that permit the explosives to settle in obscure or hidden spaces are prohibited. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Care shall be taken to preclude deposition of explosives from sump effluent due to drying, temperature changes, or interaction with other industrial contaminations. Sweeping and other dry collecting measures should be used to keep appreciably water soluble explosives out of the drainage system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Drains between the source of explosive and the sump shall be troughs with rounded bottoms and with removable ventilated covers to facilitate inspection for accumulation of explosives. Waste liquids shall not be run into close drains and sewers. Drains shall be inspected periodically and necessary steps taken to prevent the buildup of explosives deposits in them. Drains and sewers containing explosive waste materials shall not be connected in a manner to empty such wastes into the normal sewage systems carrying inert or sanitary wastes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (k)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hardware: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) Hardware in buildings containing exposed explosive materials, explosive dusts, or vapors should be of nonsparking material. Installation of hardware (piping and ducts) should not be affixed to blowout panels or walls. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Fasteners such as nuts and bolts which could accidentally drop into explosives or explosive constituents shall be prevented from doing so by being drilled and thonged or otherwise secured. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (l)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ventilation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Exhaust fans through which combustible dust or flammable vapor pass shall be equipped with nonferrous blades, or the casting shall be lined with nonferrous material. Motors shall be of the proper National Electric Code (NEC) class for the hazard (National Fire Protection Association Standard No. 70). Exhaust systems shall be cleaned and serviced on a regular scheduled. The entire system shall be bonded and grounded. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (m)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Steam for processing and heating. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Process steam is that which is in direct contact with explosives, used directly in their manufacture; or that which, in case of equipment failure, would exhaust directly into contact with explosives or explosive fumes. Steam used for heating operating buildings containing explosives should have a maximum pressure of 5 psi (228  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F). When necessary, process steam may exceed 5 psi, up to 15 psi. The exterior of stem or hot water pipes in contact with wood, paper or other combustible materials shall not exceed 160  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F. When steam temperature must exceed 228  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F in hazardous locations, steam lines shall be covered and painted with an impervious material or otherwise protected against contact with explosives. Requirements for steam pressure exceeding 15 psi shall be evaluated by the contracting officer on a case-by-case basis. When a reducing valve is used, no relief valve shall be bypassed in a manner permitting circumvention of the pressure reducing equipment. The production of superheated steam caused by the throttling action of reducing valves shall be prevented. Use of a ``water leg'' or water column to control steam pressure of 5 pounds or less is recommended. When close control of steam temperature is necessary, indicating and recording pressure or temperature gauges shall be installed. Such devices should be tested periodically and the test results recorded. When electrical resistance to ground is high, steam lines shall be properly grounded where they enter buildings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (n)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Tunnels.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To prevent possible communication of an explosive, shockwave and blast shall receive special consideration in designing and constructing tunnels between buildings containing explosives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;184.160 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Electrical requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The installation and use of electrical equipment within explosives buildings, magazines, and explosives facilities shall comply with the latest edition of the NEC (NFPA Standard 70), at a minimum, except as otherwise specified herein. In planning electrical equipment for special occupancies or for hazardous locations as defined in the NEC, it is often possible to locate equipment in less hazardous or nonhazardous areas, reducing the quantity of special equipment required and decreasing the hazard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hazardous locations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Electrical equipment and installations in hazardous locations (classes I, II, and III, as defined in the NEC (NFPA Standard No. 70) shall in all cases comply with the requirements of the code for division 1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) When electrical equipment is installed in those areas that fall into the categories of both class I and class II, the equipment shall be of a type used in both locations. The installations shall be in accordance with the requirements for division I hazardous locations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Alternate power source.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In special processes and operations requiring a continuous supply of power, provisions shall be made for an alternate source. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Recession-hit Sema falls to Pounds 14m PROFITS OF Sema Group, the Anglo-French computing services company, fell from Pounds 15.3m to Pounds 14m pre-tax for 1991. Mr Pierre Bonelli, chairman, said market conditions were the worst the industry had experienced, but added that he was satisfied with the group's overall performance. Turnover rose 10 per cent to Pounds 412.5m, but at the operating level, profits were little changed at Pounds 16.5m (Pounds 16.7m). Favourable tax charges left net profits marginally higher at Pounds 10.6m (Pounds 10.4m). Earnings per share rose from 10.45p to 11.02p and a proposed final dividend of 1.6p makes a 2.6p (2.5p) total. The group's trading performance suffered from the same malaise that has depressed profits at virtually all the large European computing services companies. The recession in the UK, France and Germany has forced customers to delay projects while defence budgets have been steadily declining. Mr Bonelli said he was satisfied with turnover growth of the UK arm, which rose 17 per cent over the year from Pounds 123.8m to Pounds 145m. It was, he said, very profitable but he refused to give pre-tax profit figures for individual European countries. Germany proved a black spot where growth was essentially static at Pounds 31.7m (Pounds 31.6m.) Profitability was also hit by start-up costs associated with the formation of BAe-Sema, the joint venture established last year to bid for large defence contracts in Europe, the Far East and the Middle East. Mr Bonelli said trading in the current year would be tough. He had seen no sign of an upturn. Sema's shares closed 4p higher at 239p.</p>

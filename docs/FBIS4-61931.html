			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By station observer (Masenko); from the "Half An Hour With </F> Wang Xiao" program]    [Text] Listeners-friends: In 1993, trade between Russia  and China hit a record $7.7 billion, roughly one-third more than  in 1992. China is Russia's second largest trading partner after  Germany. Station observer (Masenko) notes: In discussing  economic cooperation and trade between Russia and China, we  should note qualitative changes that have taken place in this  respect. While bilateral trade was exclusively carried out by  the government in the past, close to 80 percent of trade is now  being conducted directly by enterprises that are partners.  Russia's export structure has undergone favorable changes, with  substantial decreases in the export of raw materials and  increases in the export of machinery products to China. The  export volume of machinery products, for example, accounted for  approximately 40 percent of Russia's total export volume to  China last year.    Our country's manufacturers of electrical appliances and  machinery have secured a solid foothold in the Chinese market.  Some 170 million people in China are still without electricity.  China's electricity shortage has greatly impeded econonic  development. The energy development plan adopted by China has  provided Russia with tremendous possibilities. With Russia's  assistance, China is now building three large thermal power  stations and will complete all 23 [as heard] powerful thermal  power plants over the next few years. Moreover, Russia will help  in the construction of a nuclear power plant in the northeast  province of Liaoning. In addition to power generation  equipment, China purchases automobiles, aircraft, metalworking  machine tools, and construction technology from Russia. The main  strengths of various technologies developed by Russia are very  reliable; they are easy to apply and their costs are reasonable.  They often play a decisive role for China's import units.    Despite growing trade between the two countries, the two  sides have yet to score substantial achievements in making  investments in each other's country. Russia now has more than  300 joint ventures, of which only a few dozen manufacture goods  and provide services; the majority are engaged in trade and  serve as agents. The adoption of a prudent approach by the  Chinese people is completely understandable. Russia is in an  economic crisis; it offers no reliable guarantees for investment  because it frequently changes its laws on foreign economic  activities. All this is not conducive to the massive infusion  of foreign capital into our country.    There are also other problems in the trade contacts between  Russia and China. The two sides have openly discussed these  problems but also say that they should be aware of key  advantages in spite of the difficulties; that is, objectively  speaking, Russia and China need and complement each other.  Russia has the goods that China needs badly, and China can  provide Russian with the goods it needs. Our two countries  share many common points, among which are a common border  extending more than 4,000 kilometers and largely similar  problems that should be resolved during the process of economic  reform. In the 1950's, China laid the foundation for its  industry with the assistance of the former Soviet Union, which  was actually Russia; this also played a certain role. It is  impossible to rewrite the aforementioned segment of history. As  their relations have entered a phase of cooperation based on  equality and reciprocity after the two countries ridded  themselves of ideological dogma, China cannot forget the  assistance provided by Russia, and the two sides hope to  maintain their partnership and ensure that their trade contacts  will expand steadily over the long term.</p>

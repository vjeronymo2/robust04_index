			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / UK Company News: RPC advances 12% RPC Group, the rigid plastic packaging maker which came to the stock market in May last year, yesterday reported an 11.8 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 6.83m to Pounds 7.63m in the 53 weeks to March 31. Mr Lindsay Mackinlay, chairman, said the results were in line with the group's expectations at the time of the float, and that the current year had 'started satisfactorily although our markets remain competitive'. The shares, which were floated at 125p, fell 1p to 151p yesterday. Operating margins increased once more, from 10.8 per cent to 11.5 per cent, and Mr Ron Marsh, chief executive, said there was scope to improve them yet further. Mr Chris Sworn, finance director, said the margin increase stemmed from higher volumes, a reduction in some overheads, including audit fees, and a switch from low margin products such as soft drink bottles to higher margin lines like sauce bottles. Mr Marsh said new products included bottles for Marks and Spencer's bath foams, bottles for Tate &amp; Lyle 'Tops' syrups, and squeezy bottles for HP Sauce. A range of baby wipe containers employed three different processors and RPC was the only UK producer who could supply the full range. It had also recently introduced 25 per cent post-consumer recycled material into its plastic paint containers, meeting environmental concerns. Group sales rose 6.7 per cent to Pounds 68m, roughly equalling the increase in tonnes of raw materials used as prices remained under pressure. Operating profits rose 13 per cent to Pounds 7.85m, before a rise in the interest charge to Pounds 220,000 (Pounds 123,000), which was caused by the Pounds 4.18m cash outflow at the time of the float when preference shares were redeemed and some ordinary shares bought in. Year end debt stood at Pounds 4.09m, 15 per cent of shareholders funds. The tax rate was 28 per cent, and earnings per share were 9.4p. A recommended final dividend of 2.2p gives a total of 3.2p, compared to a notional 3p.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4170.2&hyph;2&blank;Penal Provisions Under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule would amend this section to adopt the alternative fines provisions of title 18 U.S.C. 3571, current language that has been enacted since enactment of FLPMA to strengthen the protection of natural or cultural resources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart 4180_National Requirements and Standards and Guidelines for Grazing Administration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This subpart would be added to establish national requirements for the administration of grazing on public lands. It would also include a provision for the development of State or regional standards and guidelines for grazing administration. These requirements, standards, and guidelines are proposed to establish clear direction for managing rangelands in a manner that would achieve or maintain ecological health, including the protection of habitats of threatened or endangered species and candidate species, and the protection of water quality.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4180.1&blank;National Requirements for Grazing Administration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This new section would establish national requirements for grazing administration on public rangelands. The national requirements would include the requirement for maintaining or achieving healthy, properly functioning ecosystems and riparian areas and instituting measures to further the purposes of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). All grazing-related actions on public lands would be required to conform with the national requirements. Where the national requirements are not being met, the authorized officer would be required to take corrective action prior to the start of the next grazing season. This would include actions such as reducing livestock stocking rates, adjusting the season or duration of livestock use, or modifying or relocating range improvements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nothing in the national requirements relating to riparian systems would be construed to create a water right based on Federal law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4180.2&blank;Standards and Guidelines for Grazing Administration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This new section would establish the requirements for the development of standards and guidelines, and guiding principles for the development of standards and guidelines for grazing administration on public lands. All grazing related actions within the affected area would be required to conform with the standards and guidelines. The geographical area to be covered by the standards and guidelines developed pursuant to this section would be determined by the BLM State Director. Standards and guidelines would be required to be developed for an entire State, or for an ecoregion including portions of more than one State, except where the geophysical or vegetal character of an area is unique and the health of the rangelands could not be ensured by using standards and guidelines developed for a larger geographical area. The preparation of standards and guidelines would involve public participation and consultation with multiple resource advisory councils, Indian tribes, and Federal agencies responsible for the management of lands within the affected area. Public participation would include the involvement of the interested public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule would establish guiding principles to be addressed in the development of standards and guidelines. The guiding principles for standards to be developed pertain to the minimum soil, water and vegetation conditions required for rangeland ecosystem health. All standards for grazing administration would be required to address factors relating to soil stability and watershed function, the distribution of nutrients and energy, and the recovery mechanisms of plant communities and riparian functioning conditions. The proposed guiding principles for the development of guidelines for grazing administration pertain to the types of management actions necessary to ensure that the standards can be met. Included in these guiding principles are the requirements that State or regional guidelines address grazing practices to be implemented to benefit threatened or endangered species and candidate species, and to maintain, restore or enhance water quality; critical periods of plant growth or regrowth and the need for rest from livestock grazing; situations in which continuous season-long grazing, or use of ephemeral rangelands, could be authorized; the allowable types and location of certain range improvements and management practices; and utilization or residual vegetation limits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> CLAY TO GO ON WITHOUT SPONSORS  </P> <P> A performance by comedian Andrew Dice Clay will go ahead Sunday, but without  local sponsors.  </P> <P> A Dallas radio station became the fifth group to withdraw as a sponsor for the  show at the Starplex Amphitheatre.  </P> <P> Clay has drawn criticism for offensive references in his stand-up comedy act to  women, homosexuals and minorities.  </P> <P> KTXQ-FM's action followed the withdrawal of Coca-Cola, Miller beer, WFAA-TV and  The Dallas Morning News. The five organizations have been season sponsors of  the theater's summer concert series.  </P> <P> "We sponsor hundreds of concerts every year, and if it's going to alienate  people, or offend people, it's not in our best interest to sponsor the act,"  said KTXQ program director Andy Lockridge.  </P> <P> Larry Fontana, general manager for Starplex, said the show would go on  regardless of the number of sponsors. He said ticket sales were good.  </P></p>

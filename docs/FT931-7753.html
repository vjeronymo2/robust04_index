			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Personal touch under threat from holiday giants: A takeover may squeeze out small agencies THE MANAGING director of the the Gorton Travel Bureau in Greenwich, south London, was last week asked by a customer to book him into a certain Turkish hotel. Mr Ken Goddard, the director of the agency, replied that he had visited the hotel and would not recommend it. Mr Goddard believes the UK's 5,000 independent travel agents will survive only if they can offer travellers that sort of local knowledge and service. Some small companies fear that the proposed takeover of the tour operator Owners Abroad by Airtours, its rival, will drive many independent travel agents out of business. Others argue they will have to adopt new survival strategies even if the bid is blocked. Mr Andreas Kanaris, managing director of the Delta Travel Agency in Manchester, says: 'For better or worse, we're in a marketplace and we should be able to make good ourselves.' If the takeover goes ahead, Airtours and Thomson, the UK's biggest travel company, will control about 60 per cent of the tour market. They will also own the two largest travel agency chains, Pickfords Travel and Lunn Poly. The Office of Fair Trading has sent its recommendation to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, who is expected to make an announcement shortly. The Association of Independent Tour Operators, which opposes the takeover, says the five largest chains - Lunn Poly, Pickfords, Thomas Cook, Hogg Robinson and AT Mays - already handle more than half the holidays sold by travel agents, in spite of having only 26 per cent of shops. If the bid is referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, it will have to consider whether the links between large tour operators and travel agents allows them to squeeze smaller organisations out. Even without such links, however, the growing size of the large chains makes it difficult for small agents to compete because the large chains are able to offer price cuts that are often as big as the independent outlets' commissions. Miss Janet Poole, a director of CK Travel in Birmingham, says a client recently told her one large chain had offered him a Pounds 175 discount on a Mediterranean cruise and had also offered to upgrade his cabin at a further saving of Pounds 250. Miss Poole says: 'I could match the discount but not the cabin upgrade. The large agencies have got the volume to strike commercial agreements and we can't compete with that.' Mr Kanaris says Delta's strategy is not to confront the large agencies head-on by offering the same holidays. His agency specialises in offering late bookings which often sell at reduced prices. The tour operator, he says, usually offers the discount and the agent's profit margin is not unduly affected. Mr Kanaris employs an airline specialist to search out fares and deals that the large chains do not offer. It is not to regulation but to entrepreneurship that independents need to look.</p>

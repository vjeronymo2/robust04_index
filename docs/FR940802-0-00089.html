The Department's objective in granting the exemption allowed by this subpart is to permit long term residence in public housing developments by police officers and security personnel, whose visible presence is expected to serve as a deterrent to criminal activity in and around public housing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;960.503 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Definitions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "DP to Push for Merger of Opposition </F> Parties In Earnest--and To Endeavor To Bring In  Chaeya Personages at the Same Time"]    [Text] To prepare for the local autonomy system elections  next year, and to counter the DLP moves to win over  chaeya personages, the DP will set in motion, as  early as this week, a full-scale drive to unify the opposition  camp and to draw chaeya personages into the party.    At its Supreme Committee meeting yesterday, the DP decided  to  prepare a special countermeasure against the DLP moves. Kim  Tok-kyu, secretary general, and Che Chong-ku, planning chief of  the Executive Committee, will lead the work.    Meanwhile, Chairman Yi Ki-taek is expected to announce DP  plans concerning an opposition merger and chaeya  personages, at a press conference scheduled for today marking  the first anniversary of his chairmanship.    The chairman told reporters yesterday that "I am planning to  meet with Chairman Kim Tong-kil of the United People's Party and  Chairman Yi Chong-chan of the New Korea Party shortly to discuss  the merger issue." "Also, I will see what the Supreme Committee  will come up with and, based on it, will work actively to draw  chaeya personages into the party," he said.    "It is possible to discuss the merger issue with Chairman  Pak  Chan-chong of the Sinjong Party, too," he added.</p>

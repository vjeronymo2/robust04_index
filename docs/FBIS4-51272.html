			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 26 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Chinese  Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said today that China will  not accept conditions attached by the United States to the  renewal of China's most-favored-nation [MFN] trading status.    At today's press briefing, reporters from all countries  focused their questions on the MFN issue. We are still waiting  for the decision made by President Clinton, Wu Jianmin said, we  hope that President Clinton will make a wise decision.    Last year President Clinton issued an executive order  linking  human rights and other issues with China's MFN trading status.  A year has elapsed and the choice to be made by the U.S.  President and administration has attracted public attention.    The Chinese side has always maintained that trade should not  be linked with unrelated issues, Wu Jianmin said, such a  practice is rare in the world. China has trade ties with more  than 200 countries and regions in the world and we never had any  problems with them.    As for the differences between China and the United States  on  the question of human rights, Wu stated, China believes that  dialogue can be held on the basis of equality and mutual  respect, and the purpose is to increase mutual understanding.  China is against interference in the internal affairs of  another country.    Wu Jianmin stressed that international trade should be based  on equality and mutual benefit. The unilateral exertion of  pressure and adoption of restrictive measures with regard to  trade is not in conformity with international practices. These  measures are unwise as they harm the interests of both sides.</p>

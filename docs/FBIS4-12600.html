			<p>BFN     [Text] Jerusalem, 8 April (AFP) -- Four Iraqis crossed the  border from Jordan into northern Israel on Friday [8 April],  sparking a major security alert, military officials said.    The Iraqis, who were unarmed, gave themselves up and asked  for political asylum.    However when army spotters sighted the men just south of the  Sea of Galilee the alert was sounded fearing an armed  infiltration was underway.    Half a dozen cases of Iraqis, some army deserters, reaching  the Israeli border with Jordan have been reported in the last  two years. All have requested political asylum or to be allowed  to travel on to a third country.</p>

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Interest rate hopes sustain Nikkei revival LATE afternoon arbitrage buying pushed share prices higher and the Nikkei average closed above the psychologically important support level of 17,000 for the third consecutive trading day, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue index gained 109.86 at 17,133.64, its high point of the day. It dipped to the day's low of 16,957.56 during the morning on profit-taking and remained around the 17,000 line for most of the session. Volume dropped to 170m shares from Friday's 324m, with some large-lot investors cautious at the quick rise in equity prices. The lack of fresh news also affected activity. Advances outscored declines by 511 to 399, with 210 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 1.13 at 1,300.01, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index lost 1.13 at 1,058.79. In spite of the low level of activity, mounting expectations of an imminent cut in the official discount rate supported sentiment. Buying by public funds also improved the mood. Some brokerage issues turned higher on hopes of increased market activity after the expected interest rate cut. Nikko Securities firmed Y4 to Y669 and Nomura Securities appreciated Y30 to Y1,530. Gajoen Kanko, the most active issue of the day, forged ahead Y44 to Y226 on buying by speculative investors. Nippon Housing Loan, the debt-ridden housing loan company, jumped Y24 to Y313 in active trading following reports that creditor banks would forgo interest payments on loans. Oji Paper dropped Y55 to Y816 in reaction to Friday's news that it is to merge with Kanzaki Paper. The latter was one of the best performers of the day, climbing Y35 to Y650. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose Y20,000 to Y590,000 on recommendations by a UK broker. Profit-taking hit steels and heavy industries, which were higher last week on hopes of lower interest rates. Nippon Steel receded Y3 to Y295 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries eased Y1 to Y527. In Osaka, the OSE average moved up 31.66 to 18,455.11 in volume of 60.8m shares inflated by cross-trading - selling and buying back stocks in order to realise profits without changing the portfolio. On the OSE stock futures market, volume in January fell to the lowest for three years. A total of 665,989 contracts changed hands, down by 36.5 per cent from December's level. Options trading dropped by 21 per cent to 470,692 contracts, the lightest since November 1989. Roundup POLITICAL and economic developments played an important part in some of the Pacific Rim markets. SINGAPORE continued its march into record territory and the Straits Times Industrial index finished 24.28 stronger at a new peak of 1,644.44 on steady demand from institutional buyers. December trade figures showing a nominal 38.1 per cent rise in domestic non-oil exports provided the catalyst. Volume expanded to 104.92m shares from Friday's 95.52m, with gains outpacing falls by 217 to 41. Among shares meeting strong demand, Wearne rose 16 cents to SDollars 3.52, Singapore Bus Services was 35 cents higher at SDollars 6.75 and Neptune Orient Lines moved ahead 8 cents to SDollars 1.51. TAIWAN put on 3.8 per cent in active trade as political tensions eased after Saturday's announcement that Premier Hau Pei-tsun was willing to resign. The weighted index ended 126.67 higher at 3,501.23 after Saturday's 123-point advance. HONG KONG relinquished some ground in subdued trade, with the market wary about Governor Chris Patten's political reform proposals, which will be brought before the Legislative Council later this month. The Hang Seng index finished 53.62 lower at 5,697.78. Among actively traded stocks, HSBC Holdings, pressured by sterling's weekend decline, fell HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 59, while Hang Seng Bank shed 50 cents to HKDollars 56.50. AUSTRALIA closed barely higher as volume was cut by lack of interest and a public holiday in Victoria. The All Ordinaries index edged forward 0.9 of a point to 1,529.1. BANGKOK moved lower as a market consolidation continued. Banks were active as the SET index lost 8.73 to 965.75. BOMBAY saw a day of relentless selling which left the BSE index down 46.55 at 2,634.24. Tata Steel slipped Rs1.25 to Rs226.25 amid rumours that a broker facing liquidity problems was unloading his holdings.</p>

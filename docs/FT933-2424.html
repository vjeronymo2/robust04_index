			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Markets: Breath of fresh air as summer's lease ends - Wall Street THE END of summer is always a refreshing time in New York. As the heat and humidity drops, so the energy level picks up noticeably. City dwellers return from their summer homes, the tourist numbers dwindle, schools reopen, and the first flecks of autumnal browns appear in Central Park. The financial markets also seem to come to life as the summer slumbers recede, and there was enough action on Wall Street this week to keep investors, traders and analysts buzzing for at least another month. There was some disturbing news on inflation, which prompted a week-long, and potentially rally-busting, slide in bond prices. There was talk from senior central bankers about 'speculative bubbles' in financial markets, which, combined with an unexpected jump in money supply figures, sparked renewed speculation about the outlook for monetary policy and interest rates. There was also a huge merger in the entertainment industry that could yet turn into the first billion-dollar takeover fight of the 1990s. And to top it all off, there was the latest quarterly 'triple-witching', the simultaneous expiration of stock and stock index futures and options contracts that can temporarily turn the day's trading into a frenzied roller-coaster ride. Yesterday's witching hour did not disappoint - sell orders related to the expirations backed up quickly as the market's opening approached, creating huge order imbalances in a small army of stocks. Soon after the starting bell rang, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 17 points, and by the end of the first 30 minutes of trading a 159m shares had changed hands - the busiest half-hour in the history of the New York Stock Exchange. Five days earlier, the week had kicked off with a big surprise from the monthly inflation data. Just two days after the core measure of August producer prices had recorded its biggest decline in history, the consumer prices index was released showing a much stronger-than-expected August increase of 0.3 per cent. The news rocked the bond market back on its heels, sending the yield on the long bond back above 6 per cent. Although plenty of analysts warned not to read too much into one month's figures, and said that any selling of bonds was a natural reaction after a summer-long rally that surprised almost everyone in its length and depth, the CPI data injected a note of uncertainty into the fixed-income markets that lasted the entire week. The losses in bonds quickly fed through into equities, where the Dow closed 18 points lower on Tuesday. If traders and investors were expressing new concern about inflation, senior officials at the Federal Reserve were voicing their own fears about the impact of low interest rates on domestic financial markets. David Mullins, vice chairman of the Fed, and Lawrence Lindsey, a governor at the Fed, said in newspaper interviews that the central bank had to be wary of pushing interest rates any lower for fear of encouraging a speculative bubble in stock and bond prices of the kind that emerged in Japan in the late 1980s. They warned that the bubble could eventually burst with drastic consequences, just as the bubble burst in Japan, sending its economy into a long slump. These warnings, more candid than normal Fed utterances, were remarkable enough in their own right, but took on an added relevance when Thursday's money supply figures were released showing a sharp rebound in the growth of M2 - the broadest measure of money supply. Although the Fed recently played down the importance of M2 because of the unreliability of the data, the jump in M2 during the first week of September was regarded by many analysts as proof that interest rates need go no lower. While the M2 numbers exacerbated the decline in bond prices, equities managed to hold their ground. Stock market sentiment was relatively robust, in part because of the week's big corporate story - the Dollars 8.2bn acquisition of Paramount Communications by Viacom International, the fast-expanding cable television group. Although the deal was agreed between the two companies on Sunday, by midweek talk of a rival suitor for Paramount was sweeping the market. QVC, the home-shopping network run by former Hollywood and television mogul Barry Diller, was seen as the most likely bidder to emerge as a rival to Viacom. By Friday there was no hard evidence that a counter offer was imminent, but the speculation was enough to send traders and investment bankers home happy at the thought of the money that might be made from the market's first competitive multi-billion-dollar bid in more than three years.  -------------------------------- Monday      3634.21  +  12.58 Tuesday     3615.76 -  18.45 Wednesday   3633.65  +  17.89 Thursday    3630.85 -    2.80 Friday      3613.25 -  17.60  --------------------------------</p>

			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets: Shell-shocked Argentina sees some rays of hope - But small investors may have been hurt too badly to care The worst is over for the Buenos Aires stock exchange, shell-shocked after a 45 per cent slide in share prices since June. That, at least, is the optimistic view being put about by local brokers, who forecast a gentle but uninterrupted rise in prices for the rest of the year. Even if they are right, there is unlikely to be much cheering in the narrow streets of the city's financial centre. During the bull run earlier this year, crowds blocked traffic as they scanned the big electronic boards which flash up share prices during trading hours. These small-time punters, many of whom gambled their life savings on the stock market or played the derivatives market, panicked when share values dipped and are unlikely ever to return. Neither are the dozen or so companies, which were bracing themselves to go public, likely to venture into such a depressed and unstable market. The strong flow of foreign capital may not have stopped, but it has slowed to a trickle as foreigners have become far more cautious. All this is a great pity. Argentina has missed a golden opportunity to build a more widely based and more professional equity market, which could provide capital for companies and reasonable investment for savers. Instead, the Argentines' deep-seated speculative urges gained the upper hand. Profit-taking and anxiety overseas about Latin stocks in June sent prices down. That was the signal for heavily leveraged investors to desert the market en masse, rather than increase their margins. Banks dumped their collateral on the stock market and investors locked into futures contracts, which they thought would yield a real 25 to 30 per cent annual profit, were left holding stocks as prices fell. Now the market seems to have stopped for a rest. Brokers, optimistic as ever, say it will start to move forward and are advising clients to buy. Analysts also believe prices have hit bottom. Mr Roberto Zorgno of economic consultants Macroeconomica says: 'From now on, it is a smooth run upwards all the way to the end of the year.' Mr Eugenio Reynal, equities chief at investment bank Merchant Bankers Asociados, declares that the fourth quarter of 1992 will be the best this year. 'Inflation will fall below one per cent a month and international interest rates will probably keep falling,' he says. 'The stock exchange is still not cheap, but I am looking very carefully at some companies. Research is 90 per cent of the decision now - before it was all instinct.' About two dozen private companies which include two affiliates of food giant Bunge y Born, Citibank's local industrial holding company, and paper maker Alto Parana, have won government approval for their listings and are ready to go public. But they are holding back, waiting for prices to rise. Mr Zorgno says equity finance for a blue chip is now twice as expensive as a local bond placement. Mr Christopher Ecclestone, an equity analyst, says foreign investors will turn their nose up at any new stock which is not 'well priced', with prospective price/earnings ratios of about 10. Three local companies, including Sevel, Argentina's biggest car company which builds Peugeot and Fiat cars under licence, have gone public this year. But in each case their prices have performed badly, making investors wary of new issues. However, Mr Zorgno warns that his bullish forecast ends in December. He expects more unrest at the end of the year, when the costs of Argentina's tough adjustment policies start becoming brutally apparent. He says: 'There is a big question mark at the end of the year.'</p>

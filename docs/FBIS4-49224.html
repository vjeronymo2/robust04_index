			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "The Central Authorities Have Decided To Form a </F> Group To Handle Taiwan-Related Contingencies"]    [Text] Beijing, 1 May (WEN WEI PO)--An authoritative  person revealed here that the central authorities had recently  decided to form a Taiwan-related contingencies group, which  principal leaders of the mainland Association for Relations  Across the Taiwan Strait will be invited to join. With the  establishment of this new organization, if contingencies occur  in the future, more transparent methods can be adopted to handle  them.    Reports have indicated that, when talking about the Qiandao  Hu incident a few days ago, the high-level central leadership  hoped to draw a lesson from handling the Qiandao Hu case. They  pointed out that the relevant situation should be promptly  reported to the Taiwan Straits Exchange Foundation and that  media reports should be provided with more transparency and  efficiency. The locality itself lacked experience in handling  such incidents, and the Qiandao Hu case was handled  inappropriately. In dealing with the case, no consideration was  given to its particular nature. Therefore, there is a need to  establish a new procedure for promptly reporting contingencies  to the higher authorities and immediately releasing information  abroad, allowing reporters to provide ongoing coverage to  increase the transparency of the procedures for handling these  contingencies.    High levels of the central leadership invited the relevant  experts to assess the negative impact of the Qiandao Hu incident  on relations between the two sides. The relevant experts said  that the incident will have a short-term negative impact on the  two sides' relations, but it will not affect the two sides'  relations too much in the long run, because Taiwan's economic  development requires assistance from the mainland, and Taiwan  businessmen will not easily give up the opportunity to invest on  the mainland.    The relevant experts said that the Qiandao Hu incident has  had such great repercussions in Taiwan due to the involvement of  the Taiwan authorities and the Taiwan independence forces.</p>

			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Rhone-Poulenc named as next in French sell-off RHONE-POULENC, France's flagship chemicals group, will be the next to be sold in the government's ambitious privatisation programme, the French economy ministry said yesterday. The sale is expected within weeks, depending on market conditions. The announcement ended speculation that the government would capitalise on the successful privatisation of Banque Nationale de Paris by bringing forward the sale of its 50 per cent stake in Elf-Aquitaine, the oil group. The privatisation of Elf would raise about FFr50bn (Pounds 5.8bn) compared with the FFr15bn forecast from the sale of the government's 43 per cent stake in Rhone-Poulenc. Elf, which will be the third of 21 public sector companies to be privatised, is expected to be sold early next year. Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, said Rhone-Poulenc was better prepared than Elf for privatisation. The structure of the sale is expected to be similar to that of BNP, with separate tranches for individual and institutional investors. The government and Rhone-Poulenc will also create a core of stable shareholders, to represent between 25 per cent and 35 per cent of the company's capital. Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, Rhone-Poulenc chairman, is confident of a successful privatisation as the partial sale in January, when the state sold 10 per cent of the shares, was oversubscribed. Observers in Paris also expected a smooth sale. 'The sharp rise in BNP's share price yesterday will have whetted the appetite of individual investors,' said one analyst. He said that shares in Rhone-Poulenc were also likely to be attractively priced to maintain the momentum of the privatisation programme. However, Rhone-Poulenc is suffering from difficult markets. In the first-half, net profits fell by about 11 per cent to FFr1.37bn, reflecting depressed conditions in the bulk chemicals and fibres markets. The company's healthcare operations, which last year generated 73 per cent of group operating profits, have been hit by reforms in Germany and Italy. BNP shares suspended, Page 20</p>

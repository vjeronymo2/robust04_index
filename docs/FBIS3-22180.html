The foregoing is part of the presentation on contamination  of  the environment offered yesterday [7 Nov 1993] by Luis Munguia,  the director of the Center for the Study and Control of  Contaminants (CESCCO) of the Ministry of Health.    The official basically attributed this problem to industrial  wastes and feces deposited in the water and on the ground, from  which they are carried by the air to food consumed by the public.    Munguia confirmed what had already been published by LA  PRENSA, that 80 percent of the water used by the public is  contaminated by human waste, except for Tegucigalpa and San  Pedro Sula, where water is treated before reaching the consumer.    As an example, the CESCCO researcher indicated that, of 36  industrial firms in this city, only one has anything approaching  a system for treating industrial waste.    This suggests, he said, that the remainder of the industries  contribute to environmental contamination by discarding their  refuse anywhere.    He said that in San Pedro Sula there is a tannery whose  highly toxic waste is contaminating the Chamelecon River.    He described similar situations in innumerable  municipalities  throughout the country, where Public Health and municipal  inspectors do nothing while contamination becomes worse.    Obsolete drainage systems, systems of ``floating'' sewage in  the streets, and inadequate drainage systems in industrial  enterprises stimulate the increase in environmental  contamination. This will continue as long as the necessary  measures are not taken, Munguia said.    With unusual frankness for an official, Munguia said that  there are agencies that have no reason to exist. Some agencies  are afraid to enforce the law with companies that contaminate  the environment, and others authorize unrestrained urban  construction without any regulation.    The timidity shown by the authorities in applying the law to  those companies without sewage treatment systems is related to  political commitments they have made with business during  campaigns. ``Something must be done today, not tomorrow or the  day after.'' With that remark, Munguia launched an appeal to  society to join the fight to protect the environment from  pollution.    CESCCO expert Guillermo Espinoza also took part in the cycle  of lectures and outlined the actions that the organization  carries out in its role as investigative agency for problems of  contamination.</p>

			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: STAKES HIGH AT HALFTIME AT USC GAMES  </P> <P> Finally, we're going to see how USC students respond to real pressure.  </P> <P> At halftime of each Trojan men's and women's basketball game this season, two  students will be given chances to sink four specified shots in 24 seconds.  </P> <P> The prize? Free tuition for a semester.  </P> <P> The countdown begins tonight at the Lyon Center on campus, where the women play  Texas.  </P> <P> By the way, how many shots does a USC player have to make to get eight  semesters of free tuition.  </P> <P> Trivia time: What do Laker Coach Mike Dunleavy and Clipper Coach Mike Schuler  have in common?  </P> <P> Roto-rooter alert: Even if you're not in a rotisserie league, it's legal to  read "Rotisserie League Basketball."  </P> <P> Editors Glen Waggoner and Robert Sklar evaluate each player in the NBA. For  example:  </P> <P> Jon Koncak, Atlanta: "Never one to run his mouth or feign injury, Koncak simply  goes out and gets you four points and four rebounds every single night."  </P> <P> Scott Roth, Minnesota: "He broke his nose for the ninth time last season. Alas,  his shot is no straighter than his septum."  </P> <P> Add rotisserie: Of Joe Barry Carroll, before his release by the Denver Nuggets,  Waggoner and Sklar wrote: "The real Mailman: He's slow, doesn't deliver and is  surrounded by dogs."  </P> <P> Some reward: The Tampa Bay Buccaneers have lost five games in a row and six of  their last seven.  </P> <P> Still, when asked whether he plans to fire Coach Ray Perkins, Buccaneer owner  Hugh Culverhouse said: "Even if we lost every game the rest of the year, even  if Ray Perkins wanted to quit, I wouldn't let him. I'd make him come back and  coach the team next year. I hope that makes it plain and simple."  </P> <P> Mr. Inside: Bill Laimbeer and other contemporary NBA centers might have a  shooting touch from long range, but George Mikan, considered the first great  center of pro basketball's modern era, recently said he couldn't imagine  himself taking on that role.  </P> <P> Mikan, who played two years in the old NBL and with the Minneapolis Lakers from  1948-'49 to 1955-'56 (he retired in 1954-'55), added:  </P> <P> "The only time I would shoot from the outside was in practice, and then it was  only when we were shooting for milkshakes. And as far as ballhandling goes, I  always said that when I dribbled, it was two bounces and a kick."  </P> <P> Remember their slogan: Jan Hubbard of Newsday isn't so sure James Worthy's  endorsement possibilities have narrowed.  </P> <P> He suggested: "Hi, this is James Worthy for the Yellow Pages."  </P> <P> Run 10 laps: Sports promoter Al Franken comes neither to praise junk bond king  Michael Milken nor to bury him -- merely to point out that Milken, who was  sentenced last week to 10 years in prison for violating federal securities laws  and other crimes, built a state-of-the-art running track two years ago for his  alma mater, Birmingham High School in Van Nuys.  </P> <P> Does this give new meaning to the term artificial surface?  </P> <P> Gimme a G, gimme an R. . . . : Michael Milken and actress Sally Field were yell  leaders together at Birmingham High.  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Both were with the Milwaukee Bucks -- Dunleavy as a player and  Schuler as an assistant coach -- in 1983-'84.  </P> <P> Quotebook: New York Knick guard Mark Jackson, asked to explain his team's poor  play in losing to Houston, 115-88, three days after playing well in a 106-79  victory over Philadelphia: "It's hard to explain our Heckle and Jeckle  performance."

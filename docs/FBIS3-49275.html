			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The Christian Democrats [SKD] are not yet  satisfied with the hitherto results of the negotiations about  the coordination of opinions regarding the passing of the  constitutional law. Therefore, they cannot support the changes  to the constitutional law yet. Miroslav Mozetic told this at a  regular news conference of the Christian Democrats today. He  also said that the party is preparing for all possibilities  envisaged by the Law of Local Self-Rule, which regulates the  elections into new or old communes. Gojko Brvar reports:    [Begin Brvar recording] [passage omitted] The party holds a  well-established opinion regarding the affiliation of the  center-oriented political parties, which the party's secretary  general, Edvard Stanic, repeated today. The affiliation of the  political parties is a necessity on the Slovene political scene.  The political field is thus narrowing and becoming more  definitive. [passage omitted]    The affiliation on the right is still characterized by the  relations between the Peoples' Party and the Christian  Democrats. After numerous offers of the Slovene Christian  Democrats, a public initiative for wider affiliation came from  the Peoples' Party just before the New Year. The Christian  Democrats have heard it with interest, but expect that they will  nevertheless get an answer to their earlier initiatives.  Namely, the Slovene Peoples' Party still has not responded to  the last initiative, which was suggested at a personal level by  the president, leader of the club of deputies, and secretary  general of the Christian Democrats.    When asked how would the Christian Democrats view a possible  Social Democrat [SDSS] withdrawal from the government coalition,  Edvard Stanic did not give a direct answer. Indirectly, he  hinted that a withdrawal of one coalition partner would not  necessarily result in the withdrawal of the Christian Democrats.  [passage omitted] [end recording].</p>

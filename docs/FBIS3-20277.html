			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Philip Stephens report: "Hurd Hits Out at Eurosceptics"] </F>   [Text] Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, last night  acted to roll back the recent tide of Euroscepticism in the  Conservative party by strongly re-affirming the government's  fundamental commitment to the European Union [EU].    In a speech reasserting his own political authority in the  cabinet, Mr Hurd publicly derided those who thought Britain  could turn its back on Europe.    The comments contrasted sharply with the anti-Brussels  remarks earlier this week of Mr John Major, the prime minister.  Mr Hurd's speech to Tory activists at the party's spring  conference in Plymouth, left the impression he was delivering an  implicit warning to the prime minister not to cede ground to the  party's right-wing Eurosceptics. Later in the day, the foreign  secretary coupled his strong words with a clear signal that  Britain could compromise on the voting issue as long as its  European partners give ground.    As he flew to a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Greece  last night, he said the dispute would sooner or later be  resolved: "At the end of the day there is agreement. That's the  way the Community works. That's the way it will work this time."    Mr Hurd's Plymouth speech appeared to deliver a thinly  veiled  rebuke to those in the cabinet who have turned the present votes  row between Britain and its partners into a broader onslaught  against the European Union.    The traditionally sceptical tone of right-wing cabinet  ministers like Mr Michael Portillo and Mr Peter Lilley has more  recently been echoed by similar sentiments from Mr Kenneth  Clarke and Mr Michael Heseltine -- both self-avowed  pro-Europeans, but also potential successors to Mr Major in any  leadership contest.    But the foreign secretary told party workers to call a halt  to the "lunatic" discussion of whether they were pro or  anti-European. Instead they had to grasp the central message:  "The future of Britain rests in Europe."    Mr Hurd's untypically tough language in Plymouth appeared to  reflect his growing frustration at the way in which the dispute  over majority voting once the Union is enlarged next year has  shifted the centre of gravity among Tory MPs towards the  Eurosceptics.    He insisted he was as determined as anyone to fight for  Britain's interests in Europe but the Conservatives must reject  a "sour, defensive attitude which concentrates exclusively on  the negative things about the European Union."    Speaking after his address, Mr Hurd said the cabinet had  agreed on Thursday that it must fight a positive, pro-European  campaign in the critical elections to the Strasbourg parliament  on June 9.    Mr Major, who is to address the closing session of the  Plymouth conference later today, is now expected to tone down  attacks on Brussels. He will be joined on the platform by both  Mr Heseltine and Mr Clarke.    It also emerged yesterday that the cabinet agreed this week  that all future ministerial pronouncements on Europe must in  future be cleared through 10 Downing Street in order to minimise  the appearance of divisions.    Mr Hurd told his colleagues on Thursday of the need to  maintain a positive and consistent line if the Conservatives are  not to suffer heavy losses in the June Euro-elections.    The foreign secretary offered a detailed assessment of the  economic and security realities which meant that Britain could  not detach itself from Europe. He concluded: "Unless we can  lift our sights we shall put at risk Britain's position."    Mr Hurd stressed that this did not mean that Britain could  not argue its case strongly in Europe.</p>

			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HMO MEMBERS FIND QUALITY OF PROGRAMS MUCH SUPERIOR TO TRADITIONAL HEALTH CARE  </P> <P> In his March 26 Viewpoints column, "HMOs Are Far From DOA: Despite Their  Numerous Problems, Health Maintenance Organizations Are Here to Stay," Dr.  Brant S. Mittler used scare tactics in another attempt to influence public  opinion against HMOs. This time, he is "warning" that many people may be  encouraged to join an HMO.  </P> <P> Survey after survey indicates that HMO members find the coverage, cost and  quality of care preferable to the fee-for-service system. Members give their  HMOs high marks for the caring attitude of the physicians, availability of  appointments at short notice and the extent of their coverage.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, researchers continue to find the quality of care in prepaid plans as  good if not better than fee-for-service practice, whether the coverage is  employer-based, Medicare or Medicaid.  </P> <P> After his "chilling" opening statement, Mittler suggests that HMOs have failed  to stem the tide of rising health-care costs. Apparently he doesn't know that  the approach to medicine introduced by HMOs saves the health system millions,  perhaps billions, of dollars each year. While HMOs and indemnity insurers are  subject to the same steep rises in hospital costs and salaries, HMO premium  increases are consistently lower. But HMOs account for 13% of the market. They  cannot be expected to cure the ills of the 87% they do not yet cover.  </P> <P> Mittler cites the old chestnut about younger, healthier employees joining HMOs,  while older, sicker workers stay with traditional insurance and increase the  costs. Sophisticated observers know this doesn't make sense. Ask employers  where their health dollars go. As studies have shown, a disproportionate number  of health-care dollars go -- and should go -- to prenatal and neonatal care,  both areas where HMOs provide top-of-the-line coverage.  </P> <P> More important is the HMO offering of comprehensive benefits while employers  continue to cut reimbursement for services through dramatically increased  co-payments and deductibles.  </P> <P> JAMES F.

			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Inflation figure reflects falls in mortgage rates BIG FALLS in mortgage interest rates placed strong downward pressure on headline inflation last month. The retail prices index fell to 139.7 in November, compared with 139.9 in the previous month. That took the annual rate to 3 per cent, a significant drop on October, when inflation was running at 3.6 per cent. The Central Statistical Office said the reduction in mortgage interest payments, after interest rate cuts in October, was one of the main factors behind the drop. More recent cuts in base rates would continue to affect the index into the new year, the CSO said. The RPI, excluding mortgage interest payments, rose by 3.6 per cent in the year to November compared with 3.8 per cent in October. The fall could be explained by depressed price rises in four main components of the index: Food prices rose by 0.4 per cent in the year to November, the lowest rate of increase for this component of the index since May 1983. Seasonal food prices, which usually rise in November, fell by 0.2 per cent on the month, and by 12.4 per cent compared with a year ago. It was the sharpest fall in prices since May 1983, when they fell by 16.1 per cent. The decline reflected cheaper potatoes and eggs, and plentiful supplies of fresh fruit and vegetables. Non-seasonal food fell by 0.2 per cent on the month. The price of tobacco rose by 8.5 per cent in the 12 months to November, down from 9.5 per cent in October. That was because prices rose by only 0.8 per cent last month, after a 1.7 per cent rise in October. Further discount sales, especially for women's clothing, lay behind another year-on-year decline in the prices of clothing and footwear. Prices fell by 0.4 per cent on the month, the first fall for any November since 1981. Compared with a year ago, prices fell by 0.6 per cent. Lower car prices offset the effect on motoring expenditure of higher petrol prices. Prices compared with a year ago rose by 4.2 per cent. The CSO said the higher cost of imports, after sterling's devaluation in September, had not yet affected retail price inflation. A lag of several months is expected. The figures also showed that service-sector inflation is proving harder to quash. Prices of personal goods and services - a component that includes chemists' goods, hairdressing, dental charges and subscriptions to private healthcare - rose by 5.5 per cent in the year to November, an increase on the previous month, when it rose by 5.3 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] There are reports that Republican National Movement  for Democracy and Development [MRND] militias have been  infiltrating into countries neighboring Rwanda, with the mission  of exterminating Rwandese refugees in those countries. All the  countries neighboring Rwanda are hosts to millions of Rwandese  refugees. Burundi, Zaire, Uganda and Tanzania have hosted  millions of Rwandese refugees for a long time. This mission to  exterminate Rwandese refugees in neighboring countries is more  likely to succeed in countries where the refugees live in areas  that are easily accessible from the Rwandan border. The UNHCR  should take appropriate measures to preempt this impending  catastrophe, otherwise they may start reacting when the  situation is out of control.</p>

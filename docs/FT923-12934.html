			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ecuador's bonanza threatened by EC action - At a time of rising production, European sales are at risk ECUADOR'S BANANA bonanza, which brought in USDollars 715m last year, is threatened by mounting production and the European Community measures to limit Latin American access to the European market. Despite growing competition from countries with lower transport costs, such as Colombia and, more recently, Venezuela and Mexico, Ecuador more than doubled exports to Germany last year, but producers are extremely worried about future European sales. 'These countries sell us free market policies but don't apply this themselves. We're dismantling our tariffs while they are being protectionist,' said economist Mr Luis Luna, under-secretary for foreign trade. So far, Germany, which has a higher banana consumption level than most other European countries and also provides a channel to the east European countries, has not charged levies on banana imports. Tariffs and quotas to protect more expensive bananas produced in the former African, Caribbean and Pacific colonies of EC members, would bring 'a significant reduction in Ecuadorian exports - the price in Germany would rise and demand would drop. It's not just a question of helping us, the producer, it's the banana consumers, too,' explained Mr Luna. Nearly one-third of Ecuador's 2.7m tonnes of banana exports went to Germany, Belgium, Italy and Greece in 1991. Sales to eastern Europe have declined - Yugoslavia was an important market - while there is little prospect of compensating for the drop in earnings from the EC with exports to other parts of the world. Apart from the EC issue, Ecuador faces the problems of growing international supply and overblown domestic production. The increase in world demand in 1990 and 1991 pushed up prices and encouraged new plantations, which are now coming into production. Although the National Banana Programme (PNB) only gives new growing permits to producers with export contracts and adequate technical back-up (including disease control), over 30,000 hectares (75,000 acres) of unauthorised plantations have sprung up in addition to the 105,000 ha registered under the programme. Even the bigger, more modern plantations are not as productive as Costa Rica's banana farms. But overall, production costs are lower and Ecuador is well away from the hurricane zone. Sigatoka disease, which has spread southwards from Esmeraldas to the main growing areas of Guayas, Los Rios and El Oro, is a greater threat than climate. Producers are critical of official efforts to control sigatoka, and this is one of the main reasons behind the banana lobby's move to privatise the PNB. As the programme is largely financed by contributions from the producers, the government has had to listen, if unenthusiastically. The new government, led by Mr Sixto Duran, due to take over on August 10, is more likely to be responsive to the private sector's proposal. Exporters are also pressing for a reduction in the export reference price, currently set at USDollars 4.50 a 43 lb box. Although demand was strong at the beginning of the year and sales rose to USDollars 287m in the first four months, exporting companies are now feeling the foreign competition. Ecuador sends some 44 per cent of its bananas to the US - other Latin American producers are also better located for this market. On the other hand, Ecuador has good access to New Zealand, Korea and Japan which, taken together, account for over 10 per cent of exports. The Ecuadorian government has taken the EC quota problem to the Gatt (although it is not yet a member) and is co-ordinating marketing policy with other 'dollar area' producers. Both the trade ministry and president-elect Duran have mentioned the possibility of retaliatory trade measures if EC countries insist on applying restrictions from January 1993.</p>

			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / RMT workers vote narrowly for rail peace THE THREAT of further industrial action on the railways receded last night as members of RMT, the main rail union, rejected the advice of their union leaders and voted narrowly in a ballot to support British Rail's peace formula. The conflict over the use of contract labour and union demands for a guarantee that there would be no compulsory redundancies led to two damaging one-day strikes last month. They cost British Rail about Pounds 20m in lost business. The railway workers voted 18,544 in favour of British Rail's package and 18,361 against, but on only a 62.5 per cent turnout. The union's executive committee had recommended rejection. Mr Jimmy Knapp, the RMT's general secretary, said this meant there would be no more disruption on the railway network. But he said the ballot result showed 'there is a deeply discontented and disaffected workforce out there'. During long negotiations with the union, British Rail made a number of important concessions. It said it saw no reason why any railway workers should have to leave the industry against their will over the next couple of years and did not foresee expanding the use of contract work during the same period. The backing for British Rail was more decisive among its engineering workers and technicians in British Rail's workshops, where the vote was 1,613 for acceptance and 532 for rejection. This followed British Rail's promise of no compulsory redundancies in the workshops for at least the next 12 months. Sir Bob Reid, chairman of British Rail, said he was delighted at the outcome. 'It is a victory for common sense', he said. 'I am pleased that railway workers have told the RMT that they want an end to this dispute. He added: 'The union must now do what its members have demanded.' Sir Bob went on to say that British Rail hoped to continue its relationship with the RMT 'in the way we always have done with good sense and sympathy'. But British Rail said last night that it had not changed its decision to end the check-off system with the RMT under which British Rail paid members' union subscriptions into the union's coffers from their wage packets. British Rail made the decision after the RMT went ahead with a second damaging one-day strike. Mr Knapp admitted last night that the peace proposals made by the British Rail board - 'though falling short of the union's objectives' - did have 'positive aspects'.</p>

			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / International Company News: Commerzbank buys Polish stake Commerzbank yesterday announced a further move into eastern Europe with the planned purchase of a 20 per cent stake in Bank Rozwoju Eksportu (Export Development Bank), a privately-owned Polish bank specialising in export and corporate finance. The German bank said its interest in the bank, founded in 1986 and now with 10 branches, was strategic. The stake requires the approval of NBP, the Polish central bank. The central bank said it would only consider the application after Bank Rozwoju Eksportu has held its next shareholders' meeting in mid-October.</p>

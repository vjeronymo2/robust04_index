			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Price Waterhouse to advise Russia on Lada sell-off Russia's Avtovaz, the producer of Lada cars, has hired Price Waterhouse as its auditors and advisers ahead of moves beginning next month to privatise a flagship of Russian industry. Mr Nikolai Glushkov, deputy director of Avtovaz, said it had hired the firm primarily to enhance the plant's ability to attract western finance. Some 25 per cent of Avtovaz shares will be sold at an auction next month, using vouchers which have been distributed to Russia's 160m citizens. Another 22 per cent will be offered at a separate investment tender next month to big corporate investors. But Mr Glushkov said he hoped to attract foreign investors through capital increases planned for next year. As proof of its commitment, Price Waterhouse has set up a special office of 20 people at Togliatti, the remote industrial town built specially for the factory and its 100,000 workers. Mr Peter Rogers, a Price Waterhouse partner responsible for the Togliatti operation, said the contract extended beyond auditing. 'We're advising them in a broader sense. We're training their accountants, setting up an international accounting department, and providing a wide range of advisory services.' Avtovaz employees and management will receive 51 per cent of the company's present capital. Avtovaz has ambitious expansion plans and wants to produce a new family of cars. It is taking part in a separate industrial consortium which wants to produce a lower-quality car in the Opel Corsa range. Mr Glushkov said Avtovaz, which last week signed an agreement for a Dollars 150m (Pounds 101m) loan from a Swiss finance company, was holding talks with various western car makers, including Fiat, which helped Avtovaz produce its Lada car in the first place.</p>

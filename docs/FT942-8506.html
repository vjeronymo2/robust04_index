			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Delay over start of race 'doomed' Senior Labour politicians conceded yesterday that the shadow cabinet's demand for a three-week moratorium on campaigning for the party leadership is bound to fail. Covert campaigning lapsed yesterday as MPs prepared for the funeral of John Smith, the former leader, in Edinburgh today, which will be followed by burial on Iona tomorrow. But campaigning is expected to begin in earnest on Sunday, in spite of the shadow cabinet's decision on Wednesday to ban electioneering until after the June 9 European elections. Shadow ministers said the moratorium was imposed because of fears that the party's European effort would be distorted by demands for equal media exposure One senior shadow minister said the 'technical' ruling was intended to stop candidates filing formal nomination papers until after the June 9 poll. That would prevent squabbling about issues such as appearances at press conferences and on radio and television programmes, he said. Some shadow ministers said there would be 'an almighty row' if leadership candidates spoke on issues outside their shadow cabinet portfolios. Other MPs said the ruling would act as a challenge to candidates to find coded ways of setting out their political philosophy. The first test will come on Sunday when Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, addresses the Welsh Labour conference. Mrs Margaret Beckett, deputy leader, is also expected to give a television interview on the same day. There is growing desire for a wide range of candidates rather than a straight choice between two candidates from the modernist and traditionalist wings.</p>

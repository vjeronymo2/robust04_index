			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Treasury guided over the rapids: Peter Marsh on why Sir Terry Burns called in a management consultant In the Treasury she is known as Sir Terry Burns's right-hand woman. Ms Wendy Pritchard, a management consultant, was called in by Sir Terry, Treasury permanent secretary, about a year ago. Her brief is to facilitate management changes and encourage officials to open up more to the outside world. The Treasury, the most powerful government department, is undergoing a period of restructuring to reduce the number of officials in its top layer and to involve more junior staff in decision-making. Sir Terry, permanent secretary since 1991, has also called in Sir Colin Southgate, chairman of Thorn EMI and one of Britain's most highly regarded industrialists, to supervise a detailed review of the way top managers operate. While Sir Colin has a specific remit which will last until the autumn and is tied to a formal scrutiny of Treasury operations announced in the last Budget, Ms Pritchard has a more fluid role. During the past year she has come to the Treasury every few weeks to talk to top officials and advise on how they link with outsiders and their own departments. She has also participated in three special meetings of the Treasury's management board - a group of eight senior civil servants - to review how the department operates. In an interview, Ms Pritchard was keen to elaborate on her general approach to consultancy but refused to talk about her specific role at the Treasury because she said this would breach confidences. She described her work in big organisations as 'rather like having to drill down through layers of sediment to find out about the way things were done years ago and which often influence how things are done now. The process of change is often about unpicking these past practices and suggesting something new'. When working with big organisations, she says she tries to stand back and appreciate the pressures on top managers and the way they make decisions. She said part of her job with clients was to identify the 'antibodies to change'. 'Managers have to try to find time to react not just to the events of today but longer-term strategies,' said Ms Pritchard. 'That can be difficult when external changes (in political events and business practice) are taking place at such a huge rate. In the past, managers used to have to cope with the occasional burst of rapids while now it is white water all the way.' Ms Pritchard has been a freelance management consultant for five years. She has won general respect for her approach in the Treasury, where morale has suffered because of criticism for underestimating the extent of the early 1990s recession and for mistakes linked to Britain's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism. One person close to the Treasury said: 'She is operating in the way you would expect of a counsellor, talking to officials about their relationship with each other and with their more junior staff. She is very interested in the process of management rather than being driven by the need to implement solutions.' Another person knowledgeable about her role said: 'Occasionally I have the feeling she has been over-deferential to top officials and has been too keen to listen to them rather than impose new ideas. She's very anxious to see the Treasury take on a more participative approach to management which carries everyone along with it, rather than the normal Treasury style which is to form a small group to tackle a specific policy area and crack on with the job by involving as few people as possible.'</p>

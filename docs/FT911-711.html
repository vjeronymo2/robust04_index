			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Kunick calls for Pounds 17.6m as profits decline KUNICK, the amusement machine and nursing homes group, is seeking Pounds 17.6m via a rights issue to help reduce gearing and to enable further development of its core activities, although no acquisitions are planned. The issue, underwritten by Samuel Montagu, is on a 2-for-9 basis at 33p per share - a sharp discount on yesterday's closing price of 41 1/4 p, down 1 1/4 p on the day. The details were announced along with the group's results for the half year ended March 31 1991. These showed that pre-tax profits for the period had fallen from Pounds 8m to Pounds 7.3m on turnover up from Pounds 50.69m to Pounds 57.94m. The main cause of the profits downturn was a sharp increase in interest charges to Pounds 1.63m (Pounds 176,000). Trading profits for the six months rose from Pounds 8.2m to Pounds 8.89m in spite of what Mr Russell Smith, Kunick's chairman, yesterday described as 'extremely difficult trad-ing conditions in all divis-ions.' The nursing homes operated by Kunick in the UK and France were now all fully operational, but the sale of special serviced apartments in London for the elderly and retirement housing in Harrogate continued to be held up by the slump in the property market. Mr Smith said that in spite of the depressed state of the pub trade, the performance of the amusement machine business was strong. In France, the amusement machine division was recovering after a difficult first half. The directors are adjusting the level of the interim and final dividends to 'reflect more accurately the pattern of annual profits.' Therefore, they are raising the interim dividend from 0.6p to 0.8p and intend to pay a final of at least 1.2p, keeping the total for the 12 months at the same level as the previous year's 2p. COMMENT Kunick's figures were a shade disappointing to the company's strong City following but not so bad for them to lose faith in the company's strategy of turning amusement machine profits into the longer-term investment of nursing homes for the elderly. Tight management control has kept the company on course and the rights issue seems a sensible move, bringing gearing down to about 36 per cent, and enabling management to develop some of its more profitable activities. But the acquisition trail of the past looks likely to be on hold for another year or so yet. Full year figures are being scaled down to about Pounds 17m, putting the shares on a prospective p/e of under 10.</p>

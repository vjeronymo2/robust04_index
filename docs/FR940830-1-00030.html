Section 124.319 would be amended by adding a new paragraph (c) to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;124.319 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Contract termination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Substitution of one 8(a) contractor for another.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Where a Program Participant is unable to complete performance of an 8(a) contract, SBA may authorize another 8(a) Participant to complete performance and, in conjunction with the procuring agency, novate the contract to the substitute Program Participant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 48. Section 124.321 would be amended by revising the second sentence of paragraph (a), by adding a new sentence after the second sentence of paragraph (a), by revising paragraphs (c)(3), (d)(2), (d)(3), and (h)(1)(iii), and by adding a new paragraph (i) to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;124.321 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Joint venture agreements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Prerequisites for joint venture agreement. *&blank;*&blank;*  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A joint venture agreement is permissible only where an 8(a) concern lacks the necessary capacity to perform the contract on its own, and when the agreement is fair and equitable. Where an 8(a) concern brings nothing to the joint venture relationship (i.e., it lacks the management, technical,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> financial capacity to perform the contract), the joint venture arrangement will not be approved by SBA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (b) *&blank;*&blank;* <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Contents of joint venture agreement. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  *&blank;*&blank;* <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) A provision stating that not less than 51 percent of the net profits earned by the joint venture shall be distributed to the 8(a) concern. In the case of a joint venture that includes two or more 8(a) concerns, no one 8(a) concern is individually required to receive 51 percent of the profits (e.g., there can be a 50/50 joint venture relationship between two 8(a) concerns). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Other requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> *&blank;*&blank;* <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) *&blank;*&blank;* <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) An 8(a) concern to the joint venture arrangement must be designated as the lead entity of the joint venture. An employee of the 8(a) concern designated as the lead entity must be appointed project manager responsible for contract performance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Accounting and other administrative records relating to the joint venture shall be kept in the office of the lead 8(a) concern, unless approval to keep them elsewhere is granted by SBA upon written request. Upon completion of the contract performed by the joint venture, the final original records shall be retained by the lead 8(a) concern. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (h)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Joint ventures with concerns owned by Indian tribes.

Two or more concerns that form an ongoing relationship to conduct business would not be considered ``joint venturers'' within the meaning of this paragraph, and would also not be eligible as an entity owned and controlled by one or more socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) A concern that is owned and controlled by one or more socially and economically disadvantaged individuals entering into a joint venture agreement with one or more other business concerns is considered to be affiliated for size purposes with such other concern(s). The combined annual receipts or employees of the concerns entering into the joint venture must meet the applicable size standard corresponding to the SIC code designated for the contract. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The majority of the venture's earnings must accrue directly to the socially and economically disadvantaged individuals in the SDB concern(s) in the joint venture. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The percentage ownership involvement in a joint venture by disadvantaged individuals must be at least 51 percent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Example 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Small business concern A is 100% owned by disadvantaged individuals. Small business concern B is 100% owned by nondisadvantaged individuals. The percentage involvement by concern A in a joint venture between A and B must be at least 51%. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Example 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Small business concern C is 51% owned by disadvantaged individuals. Small business concern D is 100% owned by nondisadvantaged individuals. Any joint venture between C and D would be ineligible because the amount of ownership involvement in such a joint venture by disadvantaged individuals would be less than 51%. Even a 90% involvement by concern C in a joint venture with D would mean an overall ownership involvement by disadvantaged individuals of only 45.9% (51% of 90), and an overall ownership involvement by nondisadvantaged individuals of 54.1% (10 + (49% of 90)). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 49.

B) within 120 days after the close of the concern's fiscal year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Upon request by the Program Participant, SBA may waive the requirement for audited financial statements. Waivers under this paragraph may be granted by the appropriate District Director only for the first year the audited financial statements are required. Beyond such first year, only the AA/MSB&amp;COD may waive this requirement for good cause shown by the Program Participant. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

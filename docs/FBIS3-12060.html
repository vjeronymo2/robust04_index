He  will instead support the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party  [PMDB] candidate.    He favors holding primaries at the PMDB to choose a  consensus  candidate for the party. He added, however, that he will  campaign for Orestes Quercia.    There are three candidates for the PMDB primaries: Orestes  Quercia, Governor Roberto Requiao, and former President Jose  Sarney, who is a senator.</p>

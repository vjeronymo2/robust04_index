			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / International Company News: Eli Lilly to spin off 20% of turnover in shake-up Eli Lilly, the US drugs group, announced one-off charges of Dollars 1.2bn before tax and said it planned to spin off its medical devices and diagnostics businesses, which account for around 20 per cent of sales. The moves signal an attempt by Mr Randall Tobias, the former AT&amp;T vice-chairman brought in to head the company last June, to concentrate Lilly's resources on its drugs business. Lilly has suffered from imminent patent expiries on some of its biggest drugs, and a widespread belief that it will not introduce any significant drugs in the near term. It is more dependent on the slowing US market - from which it derives two-thirds of sales - than most of its rivals, and it has been slow in adapting its sales and marketing activities to the managed care organisations which are starting to dominate the US healthcare market. On the decision to spin off the devices and diagnostics businesses, Mr Tobias said: 'It's a matter of strategic fit and focus - these are very, very different businesses.' The stock market applauded the move, pushing Lilly's share price up Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 61 5/8 . The businesses to be shed accounted for estimated sales of Dollars 1.25bn last year, out of a total of some Dollars 6.4bn. Analysts' estimates put their value at anything between Dollars 1.5bn and Dollars 3bn. Lilly said it may float the businesses, sell them, or issue shares in them to its existing shareholders. It plans to put six of the nine businesses into a new holding company, shares in which would be either floated or issued to existing Lilly shareholders. The outcome would depend on tax considerations, the state of the stock market, and the attractiveness of any offers for individual businesses. The remaining three businesses will also be sold, though the timing will depend partly on the resolution of undertakings Lilly made when it acquired the businesses. Lilly also reported fourth-quarter charges of Dollars 1.2bn before tax, of which Dollars 540m was the result of a voluntary retirement programme under which 2,600 people have already left. It also announced a Dollars 370m charge for rationalisation of some manufacturing operations and for changes to its 'distribution strategies', and a Dollars 290m write-down of some manufacturing assets and acquired intangible assets.</p>

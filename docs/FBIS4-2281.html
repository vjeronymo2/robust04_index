			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Tiffany Bown] </F>   [Text] Beijing, April 7 (AFP)--French Prime Minister  Edouard Balladur gave assurances Thursday [7 April] his  government would not "interfere" in China's internal affairs,  including the human rights issue, a Chinese official said.    "France has no intention to interfere in the internal  affairs  of other countries and France is willing to discuss the issues  with other countries on an equal footing," Chinese foreign  ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin quoted Balladur as telling Premier  Li Peng Thursday. Wu said the comment came as the two leaders  discussed the issue of human rights during talks between their  delegations.    "It is obvious that China and France have different views on  the human rights issue. We also noted that the French side will  not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries," said  Wu.    The spokesman said Balladur, on the first official visit  here  by a French premier in 16 years, did not bring up the arrest  last week of China's leading dissident Wei Jingsheng.    Balladur spokesman Bernard Brigouleix said later that during  the meeting the French prime minister had recalled that France  "has a traditional interest in human rights everywhere in the  world."    Brigouleix also said Li had agreed to Balladur's suggestion  of a private meeting, together with their foreign ministers,  after the working-level talks to discuss human rights including  the issue of Tibet, but gave no details.    The two premiers also discussed the development of bilateral  ties following the January normalisation of relations, which  turned frosty in 1992 over the previous French administration's  sale of 60 French Mirage 2000-5 aircraft to China's rival Taiwan.    That contract, worth several billion dollars, resulted in  the  closure of the French consulate in the southern city of  Guangzhou in January 1993 and the exclusion of French companies  from bidding for lucrative Chinese contracts. The Chinese have  agreed to reopen the consulate, Brigouleix said, although no  firm date has yet been set.    Wu did not confirm the reopening, but quoted Li as  expressing  China's "appreciation" for the "great efforts" of Balladur's  administration to improve ties.    On the economic front, the Chinese premier said French  companies had "their advantages" in the fields of transport,  energy and telecommunications, all of which were priority  development areas.    But he added that they must do more if they wish to compete  in the "fierce" Chinese market. "French enterprises are quite  competitive in certain areas, but also lack competitiveness in  comparison with other countries," Wu quoted Li as saying.    The spokesman announced that French Minister of Industry,  External Trade and Telecommunications Gerard Longuet would soon  lead a business delegation to China. Wu also said Beijing would  give "positive consideration" to requests from Paris for China  to buy French wheat.    The two premiers also discussed the North Korean nuclear  crisis, with Balladur calling for China to exert its influence  over its Stalinist ally to open its nuclear facilities to  international inspection.    Li responded by reiterating Beijing's stand that "China has  only a limited role to play" and urging a resolution through  dialogue between the parties directly involved. The foreign  ministry spokesman described the atmosphere of the talks as  "very good," saying the two premiers had pledged to keep up the  momentum of high-level exchanges.    However, Wu was unable to announce that Balladur had  extended  an invitation to Li for a reciprocal visit -- in a conspicuous  departure from usual protocol.    Balladur, whose four-day visit coincides with the 30th  anniversary of diplomatic ties between France and China, is  accompanied by Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and Longuet.    He is to meet Friday with President Jiang Zemin, before  leaving for Shanghai Saturday.</p>

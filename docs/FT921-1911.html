			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Sport: The Spanish spectacular - Soccer THE ONLY certainty for a soccer manager, it is often said, is that he will be fired sooner or later. In Spain, it is nearly always sooner. Last Saturday's immensely entertaining match between Barcelona and Atletico Madrid, second and third in the Spanish championship, gave some idea why. Both teams are closing in on Real Madrid who have frittered away an eight point lead they built up early in the season under Raddy Antic. Antic was appointed manager last April when the club lay a humiliating eighth in the league. Even leading them to the top of the table brought Antic no job security. After two consecutive league defeats he was fired, on the grounds that his team was not providing the 'spectacle' Real fans required. The pressure to succeed takes its toll even on those who keep their jobs. The coaching career of Luis Aragones has been beset by psychological problems. He once locked himself in a hotel room for three days and in his brief reign at Barcelona he took to his bed for two days. Even so, last summer he accepted a job offer from Atletico's Jesus Gil y Gil, the most itchy-fingered of Spain's trigger-happy club presidents, a man who had fired managers 11 times in his four years in charge of the club. Before the season started the club flew in a psychiatrist from Texas who said Aragones was suffering from 'phobic anxiety'. By comparison Johan Cruyff, who succeeded Aragones at Barcelona, nearly four years ago enjoys such job security that the club has been nicknamed 'Cruyff FC'. But the stress and a 40-cigarette-a-day habit took their toll. Last year Cruyff collapsed as his team marched to the title and he had to have a coronary bypass. The strange thing about Saturday evening's match was that neither team played as if managed by men who knew one bad result could cost them their jobs. They looked like the teams of coaches who trusted their players' ability and intelligence. This is not a mistake English managers make. They know that players get you the sack. English managers have reacted to the increased pressure by trying to take control of every aspect of the game. The more systematic English managers dictate everything from the way their club's pitch is mown to how their players drink their half-time tea. They leave nothing to chance and nothing to players' initiative. The new breed drill their players so that every kick is part of a strict plan. Barcelona, by contrast, looked like a team whose only pre-game instruction had been to 'go out and play'. The Spanish sporting newspapers had been filled with discussions of the teams' likely tactics, complete with colour diagrams, accurately predicting Atletico's counter-attacking approach. The sort of coverage English fans rarely see. the Barcelona players appeared not to have read a word. Eleven headless chickens would have reacted to Atletico's relentless pressure with more intelligence. Cruyff could only lament afterwards that his players had not listened to a word he had said. Perhaps their minds were on Wednesday's European Cup match against Dynamo Kiev which they won 3-0, they certainly were not on the game. Barcelona fell repeatedly into Atletico swift ambushes: three or four players converging simultaneously on the ball-carrier. Barcelona failed to adjust to the pressure. Their passing collapsed and their ball control evaporated. Barcelona were, in the English parlance, playing too much football and even as it failed it was enjoyable to watch. For anyone used to the highly-drilled defence of the English Football League the marking of both teams was lackadaisical. Throughout, Toni and Aguilera of Atletico were allowed time and space on the wings to put in dangerous crosses. Schuster, a Barcelona old boy, dominated the game. He created Atletico's first goal with a chip through to Manolo. The week before, Zubizarreta, the Barcelona goalkeeper, had made the mistake which gave Real a precious draw. This time he hesitated and was lost and for the rest of the game was subject to merciless taunts from the home fans. Manolo added a second ten minutes later and Atletico, with Schuster pulling the strings, threatened to run away with the game. Where the Barcelona players never had a pass available, Schuster always seemed to have players open. Where the visitors dwelt on the ball, Schuster clipped accurate passes with his first touch. When the route to an unmarked player was blocked, Schuster would make the simple pass that was available, adjust his position and make the telling pass when he got the ball back. Schuster lacks the athleticism of Lothar Matthaus who currently controls the midfield for the German national team. But where Matthaus often seems loathe to appear eye-catching or spectacular, Schuster has the manner of the classic midfield general. The ego which has soured his relations with successive German managers is the characteristic which makes him such a dominating figure on the field. Schuster's self-confidence betrayed at the key moment. He passed under pressure unerringly over 30m and 40m, yet unmarked on the penalty spot after 54 minutes he ballooned the ball over the bar. The miss cost Atletico a win. With less than 20 minutes left Barcelona managed their first serious shot on goal. Nadal, whose clumsy play suggested the Spaniards do have a soft spot for donkeys, enjoyed a moment of grace, turning and cracking a shot past Abel, the Atletico keeper. Defending a 2-1 lead most English coaches would have ordered their teams to defend. But, Atletico kept surging forward, often leaving only three defenders to mark the most dangerous attacking trio in Spain. Stoichkov, the best of that trio, got himself sent off for kicking an opponent. It was a rare moment of malice in a game largely free of the routine kicking and tripping which mar English soccer. But Atletico managed to top that with their own moment of idiocy. Abel showily tried to control a back pass with his thigh rather than catch it with his hands. His knee got in the way and Bakero swooped to score, earning Barcelona an ill-deserved draw which pulled them level with Real, 1-0 losers at Logronees, and bringing a balmy evening to a barmy close. The large crowd in Atletico's Vicente Calderon stadium had certainly been treated to a spectacle and they had enjoyed it hugely. Indeed, they had fully played their part in it. Even though the Vicente Calderon is the second stadium in Madrid behind Real's Bernabeu, it still dwarfs every ground in the English football league. Along one side the enormous members' stand straddles a motorway. The other three sides are enclosed by a sweeping double-decker cantilevered structure. The capacity is 62,000, all seated. Sadly, like so many English grounds, it also a slum. Lumps are missing from the concrete bench seats on the upper deck - a worrying sign since Gil, a property developer, was sent to jail when a restaurant he built collapsed killing 59 in 1969. Lights are missing on the stairs and the catering facilities consist of a few shabby refrigerators containing cans of Coca-Cola - at 200pta (Pounds 1.10) each - and beer which ran out at half time. No wonder the streets outside are filled with vendors selling food jostling for space alongside others selling badges and favours - many of them Nazi and fascist emblems. In spite of this the wannabe hooligans with their skinhead haircuts, English signs and Leed United flat caps were prefered posturing to fighting. In the stands, the fans of the two teams mingled without any tension. Even though their team had thrown away a glorious victory the Atletico fans were buoyant after the game. They crammed the Metro cheerfully singing songs to their favourite side and, without apparent irony, chants about Zubizarreta's shortcomings; jumping up and down so the ancient carriages swayed alarmingly in rhythm. The folk heading into town for an evening out, looked on amused. In Spain everything to do with soccer is a spectacle.</p>

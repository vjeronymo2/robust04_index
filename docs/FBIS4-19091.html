			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara--The second term Joint Economic Commission  meeting, led by Public Works and Housing Minister Onur  Kumbaracibasi on the Turkish side and Foreign Economic Relations  Minister Oleg Davydov on the Russian side ended with the signing  of a protocol on Wednesday [6 April].    The protocol proposes the development of cooperation in the  areas of energy, transportation, communications and other areas.  It further proposes establishing new areas for cooperation.  Speaking at the signing ceremony of the protocol, Kumbaracibasi  said that the two sides had discussed all the issues in a  mutually benevolent atmosphere at the meeting.    Stressing that the relations between Turkey and Russia were  improving, Kumbaracibasi said that both sides carried good  intentions towards eliminating the problems and that more  importantly, they had reached an agreement in principles on the  issue of new and wider projects.    Davydov, who also spoke at the conference, said that the  volume of commerce between the two countries would reach $2  billion and noted that this meant that the volume of commerce  between Turkey and Russia would equal that between Russia and  the United States. He said, "Turkey will continue to be our  most essential commercial partner."    The issue of the hardships that Turkey came face to face  with  at times when Russia cut off Ukraine's natural gas was also  discussed at the meeting and the two sides agreed that the  section of the Russian pipeline passing through Ukraine be  bypassed, thus enabling the transportation of natural gas to  Turkey. Although the issue of the threats which carrying oil  through the straits posed for Istanbul was not openly discussed  at the meeting, it was nevertheless noted that the two sides  wholeheartedly supported the technical meetings on the prospect  of finding alternatives for transporting the oil. Meanwhile, at  a meeting he had with Kumbaracibasi on Wednesday morning,  Russia's first deputy prime minister, Oleg Soskovets, noted that  the issue of oil and gas was the most important area of  cooperation between Turkey and Russia and suggested that the two  sides cooperate on constructing an oil and gas pipeline between  Russia, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Armenia. Officials  reported that Russia was interested in the projects for building  a nuclear plant in Turkey and building a dam on the Coruh river  and that moreover it wanted to build a thermal power plant in  Turkey. According to the protocol, the dam and thermal power  plant be discussed only when Russia increases the amount of  natural gas it gives to Turkey from the present amount of eight  billion cubic meters to 10.5 billion cubic meters.</p>

			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / UK Company News: New vessel helps Lofs to Dollars 0.8m London &amp; Overseas Freighters, the Bermuda-based and London-quoted shipping company, reported income before tax of Dollars 795,000 (Pounds 545,000) for the three months to December 31, against Dollars 547,000. Mr Miles Kulukundis, chief executive officer, said the result was achieved in difficult trading and came despite the London Enterprise suffering a particularly poor three months of charters and one-off costs of the office move of the London subsidiary. Gross revenue doubled to Dollars 7.64m (Dollars 3.97m) as a result of increased charter rates and the inclusion of the London Pride. The figures took the nine-month profit to Dollars 2.36m (Dollars 372,000) on revenue of Dollars 20.3m (Dollars 13m). The company also announced the completion of its investment programme. It is now having two new tankers built, with the second to be delivered towards the end of 1995. The three-month profit was after a net interest charge of Dollars 1.19m (Dollars 135,000). Earnings per share fell to 2 cents (2.3 cents) following the issue of 50m shares in December.</p>

			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KHASHOGGI FREED ON $10-MILLION BAIL; FINANCIAL DRAIN DISCLOSED  </P> <P> Adnan Khashoggi, the grounded jet-setting financier, was freed on $10-million  bail Thursday, traveling by rented limousine from his jail cell to his heavily  mortgaged Manhattan penthouse where he will be monitored electronically by a  special bracelet he must wear at all times.  </P> <P> "I am pleased that the courts have granted me bail," Khashoggi said as he stood  in a wrinkled leisure suit outside the federal courthouse. "I am anxious to  begin work on my defense and look forward to clearing my name at trial. I  assure you I will be here for the trial."  </P> <P> The short, balding arms dealer, a smile fixed to his face, then tried to walk  down the steps. He was engulfed by shouting, pushing photographers. Several  people were knocked to the ground. In the melee, television cameras bumped  Khashoggi's shoulders. Lenses crowded within an inch of his face. Finally, a  wedge of U.S. marshals helped him to his car.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Charged in Marcos Case  </P> <P> Khashoggi, 54, who was a key middleman in secret White House arms sales to  Iran, is charged with fraud and obstruction of justice in connection to claims  he helped Ferdinand E. and Imelda Marcos plunder Philippines national assets.  </P> <P> Federal Judge John F. Keenan granted his application for bail Thursday over the  strenuous objections of prosecutors who argued Khashoggi had ample resources to  flee the country.  </P> <P> As a condition of bail, the Saudi businessman -- once regarded as the world's  richest man -- had been required to disclose details of his financial empire.  It provided a rare insight into an empire in decline.  </P> <P> Although Khashoggi's financial statement claimed a net worth of $54 million,  $46 million of that amount is listed as equity in real estate subject to  foreclosure proceedings in New York and Malaga, Spain.  </P> <P> Khashoggi's statement revealed that dozens of his companies around the world  are in trouble -- bankrupt, dormant or abandoned. Many of his bank accounts,  scattered around the world, have only pennies. Some are overdrawn.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Account Overdrawn  </P> <P> The disclosures surprised one of his former business executives who said that  in recent years Khashoggi "could have written a million dollar check" against  any of his bank accounts. Today, however, his balance in Monte Carlo's Bank of  Credit &amp; Commerce, for example, was listed as only 47 cents. And his  account at the Champs-Elysees branch of the Credit Commercial de France bank in  Paris was listed as overdrawn by $250.68.  </P> <P> Khashoggi also is nearly $2 million in arrears on household expenses --  reportedly owing everyone from the maids to the lawn mower repairman -- at his  homes in Marbella and Cannes.  </P> <P> Khashoggi's statement for the court, listing assets of $141.8 million and  liabilities of $88 million, also showed personal credit card debts of $81,000.  It also listed "cash in hand" of $5 million and cash in banks of $643,746.  </P> <P> On Thursday, Khashoggi's brothers Essam and Amr posted two $5-million checks  drawn on Barclay's Bank for bail.  </P> <P> Keenan set March 14 as the trial date.  </P></p>

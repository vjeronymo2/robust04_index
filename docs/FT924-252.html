			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report London Metal Exchange base metals prices moved irregularly during a thin and shortened Christmas eve grading session as dealers squared their books ahead of the holiday, traders said. Three months delivery COPPER dipped to Dollars 2,258 a tonne early on but recovered to Dollars 2,270 before ending at about Dollars 2,265, up Dollars 8 from Wednesday. ALUMINIUM rose on short covering prompted by recent support around Dollars 1,250 a tonne. Last business was at Dollars 1,255 a tonne, up Dollars 5.50. In the absence of a lead from the closed Kuala Lumpur market, TIN relinquished some of its recent price advance, with cash metal ending Dollars 20 down at Dollars 5,840 a tonne. Robusta COFFEE futures closed with losses of Dollars 2 to Dollars 9 a tonne on key positions in very quiet conditions. Dealers continued to attribute the decline to a downside technical correction following the recent advance to 20-month highs. COCOA futures ended narrowly mixed as the market continued to struggle to overcome resistance in the Pounds 695-Pounds 700 area, for March delivery. The GOLD market showed little life.

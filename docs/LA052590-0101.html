RAIL LINK URGED BY YEAR 2000  </P> <P> A legislative study urges the state to construct a $12.6-billion rail system by  the year 2000 that would carry passengers between San Francisco and Los Angeles  at speeds of 125 m.p.h. or more. The study, which the Legislature will consider  when it sets funding priorities for improving rail service in the San Joaquin  Valley, calls for building a route over the Tehachapi Mountains along  Interstate 5 to link Bakersfield and Los Angeles.  </P></p>

According to TCI, the new company was created for two reasons. First, the company anticipated that possible federal legislation or regulation might force such divestiture later under unfavorable circumstances; a voluntary separation allowed TCI to retain ties to the new company. Second, in a smaller company, management would be able to devote greater attention to maximizing the value of Liberty assets and have greater freedom to pursue growth opportunities in the cable industry. TCI management also felt that capital and financial markets had not given appropriate recognition to certain TCI interests and assets, particularly in the cable programming area, because they were difficult for security analysts and others to identify, value and track; TCI hoped that, in a smaller company, the actual and potential value of those interests and assets would be appropriately recognized. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although Liberty was organized as a separate company, it shared stockholders and directors with TCI. Five shareholders maintained voting control of both firms, and Bob Magness has simultaneously served as Chairman of the Board of TCI and a director of Liberty, and John Malone has simultaneously served as President, Chief Executive Officer, and a director of TCI and Chairman of the Board of Liberty. TCI acknowledges that the two companies have cooperated closely since Liberty was formed, and are partners in a number of ventures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1992, Congress passed the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act, Public Law No. 102&hyph;385, 106 Stat. 106 (1992) (``1992 Cable Act''), which, combined with implementing FCC regulation, established a legal framework regarding, among other things, the number of cable subscribers a person is authorized to reach through cable systems owned by such person, or in which such person has an attributable interest, and delineating the extent to which multichannel video programming distributors may engage in the creation or production of video programming. TCI claims that the cable system and programming assets of TCI and Liberty can be recombined under this regulatory framework, and that appropriate market valuation for Liberty's assets has been achieved, thus obviating the principal reasons for separating the companies. According to TCI the recombination will eliminate certain inefficiencies and costs of separation, as well as eliminate confusion and conflicts that may have resulted from the separation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While not indifferent to the cooperative relationship between the firms and the commonality of control in five shareholders and common managers and directors, the Department has analyzed the proposed merger as a transaction involving two separate entities, since separate legal and fiduciary obligations exist for each of the firms that require each firm to operate in its distinct interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Effects on competition. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A multichannel subscription television distributor (``MSTD'') is an entity that provides multiple channels of video programming to consumers on a subscription or fee basis, as differentiated from local broadcast television stations which individually provide a single channel at no charge within their broadcast areas. MSTDs deliver programming to consumers utilizing various methods, including cable, multichannel multipoint distribution (``MMDS''), satellite master antenna television (``SMATV''), direct-to-home satellite, or the facilities of common carrier telephone companies or their affiliates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The United States filed its complaint because the effects of the proposed merger may be substantially to lessen competition (i) among providers of video programming to MSTDs in the United States, and (ii) among MSTDs in the areas in the United States in which TCI and Liberty control cable system. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  The merger of TCI and Liberty would result in a vertically integrated firm with (1) substantial interests in widely distributed and popular video programming and (2) control of approximately one-quarter of the nation's cable subscribers. Accordingly, the merged firm may have both the ability and incentive to lessen competition by discriminating against non-affiliated programmers in terms of access to its MSTDs and by denying to competing MSTDs access to its video programming on reasonable terms. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> These product and geographic markets are appropriate markets in which to assess the possible competitive effects of this proposed merger. Whether or not these markets will be appropriate markets in which to analyze other transactions or conduct within the industry will, of course, depend on the particular circumstances presented in each individual case. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The market for multichannel subscription television distribution today is overwhelmingly dominated by local cable systems. Cable television service is available in nearly all urban ad suburban areas in the United States as well as many rural areas, passing more than 95% of the nation's estimated 92 million television households. Cable television systems currently serve more than 55 million subscribers in more than 11,300 cable systems located in all 50 states, or about 60% of households passed. Nearly all communities are served by a single cable system; fewer than 0.5% of the more than 10,000 cable franchise areas have more than one cable system available to local cable subscribers. Today, cable television systems face very limited competition from other types of distribution systems, including MMDS, SMATV, and direct-to-home satellite, and may face competition in the future from video dialtone services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MMDS delivers programming over microwave channels received by subscribers with special antennae. There are currently fewer than 150 MMDS systems in operation, serving an estimated 600,000 subscribers. MMDS has recently obtained regulatory approval to deploy systems that are considered technologically superior, which may increase its availability and attractiveness as an alternative to cable television service. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

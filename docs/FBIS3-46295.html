Amid a jubilant atmosphere, the Central Military Commission  [CMC] held a tea party for units stationed in Beijing and for  veteran cadres in order to greet the Spring Festival. Jiang  Zemin, Liu Huaqing, Zhang Zhen, and other leading comrades  happily gathered with veteran generals and comrades to greet the  Spring Festival.    Jiang Zemin -- general secretary of the CPC Central  Committee, president of the state, and chairman of the Central  Military Commission -- delivered a warm and enthusiastic speech.  On behalf of the party Central Committee and the Central  Military Commission, he extended cordial regards and expressed  his high respects to veteran comrades, retired military cadres,  commanders and fighters of the entire army, officers and  soldiers of the armed police, and comrades of militia units and  reserve forces!    Jiang Zemin said: Over the past year, while under the  guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, people  of our country have grasped the opportune time to deepen reform  and promote development, and have made new achievements. There  has been political stability in our society, with rapid economic  development, prosperity in the domestic market, thriving foreign  trade, and continuous improvement of the people's standard of  living. The publication of Volume 3 of the "Selected Works of  Deng Xiaoping" is a great event in the political life of our  party and state. Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping -- which is linked with Volume 2 published 10  years ago -- is a theoretical summation of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's abundant experience to guide us in carrying out  reform, opening up to the outside world, and promoting socialist  modernization; it is also scientific guidance to guide us in  continuously making successful advancements. Since the party  Central Committee decided to study Volume 3 of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, the entire country  has begun studying the works. According to the guidelines of the  14th CPC National Congress, the Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee issued the "Decision of the CPC  Central Committee on Issues Concerning the Establishment of a  Socialist Market Economic Structure." This is our program of  action in carrying out reform of the economic structure in the  1990's, and will certainly have a profound influence on our  country's reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. We  are firmly convinced that in the new year the entire party as  well as people of the entire country will continue to advance  successfully on the road of reform and development.    Jiang Zemin made a report to veteran comrades on the  achievements of army building over the past year. He stated:  During the past year, we have made new progress in army  building. Under the leadership of the party Central Committee  and the Central Military Commission, commanders and fighters of  the entire army have united as one, worked in a solid manner,  and successfully accomplished various tasks. The broad mass of  officers and soldiers have taken on a good mental outlook,  various units have maintained a high degree of stability and  centralized unity [ji zhong tong yi 7162 0022 4827 0001], and  there has been stable development in army building.    Jiang Zemin added: Members of the entire army have  conscientiously studied the guidelines of the 14th CPC National  Congress, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics, and the thinking of army building  in the new period; have conducted education on the party's basic  line in a penetrating manner; have organized cadres at and above  regimental level to study the theory and attend training on a  rotation basis; and have enhanced the consciousness and  determination of the broad masses of officers and soldiers in  implementing the party's line, principles, and policies. We  have strengthened strategic guidance for national defense and  army building. Various units have strengthened military  training and have extensively promoted the study of high  technologies. The situation for military training for the  entire army has been good and has rarely been seen in many  years. Units at various levels have attached importance to the  training of cadres and to the building of leading groups. We  have stressed the need to carry forward the fine tradition of  our army and maintain the true color of the Red Army. We have  also achieved relatively great results in improving the party's  workstyle and in advocating honesty in performing official  duties in army units. We have made new progress in scientific  research and in the improvement of arms for national defense.  We have strived to improve the units' material and cultural  lives and living condition, and have strengthened the  attractiveness and rallying power [ning ju li 0413 5112 0500] of  military units.    Jiang Zemin said emphatically: 1994 is a year of crucial  importance to China's reform, opening up, and economic  construction. We should steadfastly follow Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, pool the strength of all nationalities,  mobilize all positive factors, closely rally around the central  work of economic construction, and make efforts to constantly  push forward the cause of the socialist modernization drive.  Under the new conditions, our army is shouldering heavy  historical responsibility; it is necessary to further improve  army building and reform, and enhance the fighting capacity of  troops in an all-round manner to provide a firm and powerful  security guarantee for the state's reform, opening up, and  modernization drive. We should vigorously intensify ideological  and political construction; earnestly study Volume 3 of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping; arm the broad masses  of officers and men with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on  building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the concept  of army-building in the new period; uphold the absolute  leadership of the party over the army; and adhere to the party's  basic line and not waver in it for one hundred years. We should  continue to comply with the demand of the Central Military  Commission in further improving the quality of the army and in  creating the best armed forces which our conditions permit. In  accordance with the laws of developing a socialist market  economy and army building, we should promote the reform of  troops in an active and proper manner. As an important force  for building socialism with Chinese characteristics, our army  should walk in the forefront of society in developing a  spiritual civilization. We can have firm confidence that our  great army will never fail to live up to the great trust of the  party and the people, and will never let veteran comrades down.  In this new year, they will make greater progress!    Jiang Zemin praised veteran comrades who, during decades of  long revolutionary service, had gone through fire and water,  fought bravely, and made great contributions to the cause of the  Chinese people's liberation and the establishment of new China,  as well as made indelible contributions to the growth and  strengthening of the people's army -- this is the glory of our  party and army. Veteran comrades have extraordinary fighting  experience; they have shown concern over and support for army  building, and have thrown a great deal of energy into such work.  With respect to the achievements in army building, some credit  should go to veteran comrades. Jiang Zemin expressed the hope  that veteran comrades would continue to show their concern over  the causes of the party and army, propose more ideas, and  contribute more good policies. He asked commanders and fighters  of the entire army -- particularly middle-aged and young leading  cadres -- to emulate the veteran comrades' revolutionary spirit  and sublime style, and carry forward and display the fine  traditions of our party and army in order that the people's army  will maintain the true qualities of Red Army veterans forever.  Party committees and units at all levels should show their  concern to veteran comrades from a political stand and take good  care of them in their lives; they should further improve the  leadership in the work for veteran cadres and do more actual and  useful deeds for veteran comrades.    Liu Huaqing, member of the Standing Committee of the CPC  Central Committee Political Bureau and vice chairman of the CMC,  presided over the tea party.    Attending the tea party were CMC members Chi Haotian, Zhang  Wannian, Yu Yongbo, Fu Quanyou, Wang Ping, Li Desheng, Yang  Dezhi, Xiao Ke, Chen Xilian, and Wang Enmao; Xue Ming, widow of  Marshal He Long; Lin Yueqin, widow of Marshal Luo Ronghuan; and  leading comrades of all general departments of the People's  Liberation Army, various major units stationed in Beijing, and  the Headquarters of the Chinese People's Armed Police Force.  The troops' literary and art workers staged a brilliant  theatrical performance at the party.</p>

			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading STOCK INDEX futures traded in a tight 21-point range as hopes of a cut in interest rates began to fade, writes Joel Kibazo. The first trade in the June contract on the FT-SE 100 was struck at 2,869, 4 points ahead of its previous close, and was quickly driven higher. It was trading at 2,874 within half an hour of the opening. However, that early demand soon faded leaving the June contract to drift lower. By 11am it had fallen to 2,860. The release of favourable manufacturing output figures helped steady it but there was no advance as dealers came to the view there may after all be no immediate lowering of interest rates. A weak gilts sector saw the contract retreat further during the afternoon and it closed at the day's low of 2,853, some 12 points below Tuesday's close. Volume remained thin and closed at 5,210 down on the previous total of 6,328. The expiry of the April stock options was the main feature in the traded options and it contributed to the day's total turnover of 37,899 lots. The FT-SE 100 option traded 6,851 lots and the Euro FT-SE 100 option 4,527 contracts. British Gas was the busiest stock option with 3,117 lots, though it had no April series due for expiry. The rest of the days main trades did. Some 2,680 lots were dealt in Asda and 2,145 in Marks and Spencer. Trafalgar House and Boots were also busy.</p>

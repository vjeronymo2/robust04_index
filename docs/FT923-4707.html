			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / The new 10p coin Pocket Money: a new, smaller 10p coin will be introduced on September 30. It is similar to the old 5p, but a little larger. Its introduction will complete the break with pre-decimal coinage which began in 1971. The Royal Mint said most ticket and vending machines would take the coin soon after its issue. It said there would be some delay while machines were switched over, but the vending industry had been given more than four years notice to keep disruption to a minimum.</p>

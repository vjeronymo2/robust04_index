We killed 25 soldiers of the 6th Division and wounded more  than 50 others. We destroyed 72 barracks built with concrete,  four bridges used by the enemies for their tanks and for the  transport of ammunition -- namely the 25-meter-long O Kanhchos  bridge, the 15-meter-long (Dangkao Tamang) bridge, the  8-meter-long Bat Khteah bridge, and the 12-meter-long Ampil Pram  Daeum bridge.    We destroyed five military vehicles; two 60-mm mortars; 12  AK's; three B-41's; five B-40's; two DK-75 guns; and two  ammunition depots, which burned for five hours.

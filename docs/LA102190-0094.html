			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WHEN A CHILD HAS 3 'PARENTS,' WHEN DOES THE CONTRACT END AND REARING BEGIN?  </P> <P> In the matter of the surrogacy case now in the process of being decided, it  seems to me a very basic question has not been addressed: For what purpose did  Mark and Crispina Calvert go to such extraordinary lengths to have a child? The  answer seems obvious: They truly wanted it to love, nurture to adulthood and  provide a loving environment.  </P> <P> That same basic question must be asked of Ms. Anna L. Johnson.  </P> <P> She already has one child of her own. At any time she could have one or more  children if she so chooses.  </P> <P> Then why would she go into a surrogacy agreement? She had already experienced  carrying a child for nine months and giving birth. She knew what kinds of ties  this experience brings. The only possible answer to her motivation then seems  to be the money she would receive.  </P> <P> A child is entitled to a life with parents who sincerely want offspring, not  for any monetary gain, but simply for experiencing the joys (and also the  awesome responsibilities) of parenthood.  </P> <P> If Ms. Johnson receives the agreed amount of money to which the contract  entitles her, then she has no further claim on the Calverts.  </P> <P> JOY M. BURRIS, Anaheim  </P></p>

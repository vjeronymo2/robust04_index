			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Collecting: Art in the agora THE ECONOMIC climate might be deplorable, the art market stagnant, and French buyers prone to referendum jitters. But the Paris Biennale antiques fair, the most ostentatious in the world (and, many say, the best) is going ahead from September 18 to October 4 in the Grand Palais. This year's show, the 16th, will house 120 exhibitors - including 17 from elsewhere in Europe but only two from the US - showing works which are vetted rigorously by experts. Stands will be decked out with an unprecedented and unabashed theatricality in a set concocted by Italian stage designer, Pier Luigi Pizzi. The decor comprises a main circular space called an 'agora' and radiating streets. Opinions about the result, let alone the expense - said to be in the region of FFr5m (Pounds 520,000) - are divided. Some dealers - such as Paris Art Deco specialist Galerie Vallois, which is turning its stand into a mid-1920s' room with specially recreated silk wall hangings - have adapted happily. Others, such as tapestry specialists, are anxious that visitors will have no room to stand back and get a good look at their exhibits. The list of exhibitors is impressive. There is a jewellery section and four leading French dealers in antique books. The Antiquaires a Paris group of dealers, which specialises in mainly-18th century furniture and art objects, is back in the fair for the first time since 1986. Several other Paris specialists can be counted on to provide outstanding 18th century art; one, Jean Lupu, has designed a stand which looks like the inside of an Egyptian pyramid. Newcomer Carlton Hobbs, is the only British furniture dealer making the trip. He has planned a lavishly-curtained stand containing, among other things, a large Aubusson tapestry, late 18th century Russian furniture and several items of top English furniture of the same period. Belgian dealer Axel Vervoordt, will have one of the largest stands divided into four rooms. Exhibits will include paintings by Klein, Fontana and Tapies; ancient Egyptian and Chinese art and a lot of antique silverware - 'nothing flashy or show-off but things with soul,' Vervoordt says. Twenty-five stands will be devoted to drawings and paintings. Hopkins-Thomas of Paris, a specialist in mid-19th to early-20th century art is showing an unusual Fauve painting by Louis Valtat, circa 1905; an unpublished oil by Sisley of 1884-85; and three works by Impressionist artist Berthe Morisot, favourite model and sister-in-law of Manet. Paris-based Old Master dealer Bob Haboldt includes an oak panel portrait of Edward VI by Stretes, and a rare still life by the 18th century French artist, Louis-Leopold Boelly.</p>

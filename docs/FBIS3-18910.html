			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Fons Verplaetse, governor of the Belgian </F> Central Bank, by unidentified correspondent; place and date not  given: "Fons Verplaetse, Man of Influence: The Recession Is  Over, But Our Efforts Must Be Sustained"]    [Text] [Correspondent] The business barometer of the  Central Bank shows improvement. Is recovery now underway?    [Verplaetse] The recession is over, there is no doubt about  that. The United Kingdom suffered eight consecutive quarters of  negative growth. We had four. The recession was delayed by the  effects of German reunification. The low point came in the  first quarter of 1993. The second and third quarters were  better. A slight falling off is possible in the fourth quarter  due to the situation in the construction industry and social  conflict.    Our barometer, which is reliable whatever people may say,  shows that we should record 0.8 percent growth in 1994 without  any new factors. I believe it will be higher, but we are  remaining cautious.    [Correspondent] Not everyone is stating so clearly that the  recession is over.    [Verplaetse] But that is the situation. To say anything else  would be incorrect.    [Correspondent] Will we return to the same economic  conditions as before the recession?    [Verplaetse] The growth potential in Belgium is in the  region  of 2 or 2.5 percent. Beyond that and you start to create  tensions. Personally, I do not believe that we will exceed our  potential growth in 1994. After that, we will see.    [Correspondent] But always with persistent unemployment?    [Verplaetse] To maintain employment in the private sector we  need a 2 percent growth rate. As the working population is  growing by 0.5 percent, this means we in fact need 2.5 percent  growth in order to keep unemployment at present levels. So at  the very best we will have stable unemployment figures.    Solutions? We must act on three fronts, and sustain our  efforts: We must reduce the cost of labor compared with the cost  of capital; we must divide available employment among a greater  number of individuals with a corresponding fall in incomes; we  must increase the flexibility of the labor market. The global  plan aims to act on these fronts. I do not foresee a general  reduction in jobs.    [Correspondent] What is your reaction to company closures?    [Verplaetse] It hurts, but it is unavoidable. The relative  importance of industry is decreasing in favor of services. And  that process will continue. Some regions will be increasingly  affected.    [Correspondent] So what is to be done?    [Verplaetse] Make the most of the global plan and look at  our  fundamental problems, at our structural weaknesses. The  government's achievements to date are pretty impressive. There  is no use in burying your head in the sand. We must allow the  psychological scars to heal. We must not be impatient. The  dialogue will recommence. The Belgians are pragmatists. After  all, what is one year in someone's life?  <H5>  Pleased With the Rate of the Franc </H5>   [Correspondent] Is the present strength of the Belgian franc  justified? Does it reflect a healthy Belgian economy?    [Verplaetse] I believe that the Belgian economy is sound. We  no doubt have certain structural weaknesses. The private sector  remains much more efficient than the public sector. The current  account shows an excellent result with a positive balance of  over 300 billion Belgian francs.    [Correspondent] So you are pleased with the present rate of  the franc?    [Verplaetse] Yes.    [Correspondent] Is your aim to arrive at the same central  bank rate as the Germans?    [Verplaetse] We need the lowest possible interest rates in  order not to aggravate the problem of public finances. On the  other hand, the central bank rate has no effect on households.  For companies, that depends.    So the question is how we can help companies. The answer is  simple. It is by giving them the lowest possible costs. But 40  percent of costs come from imports. Then there are other  factors such as index-linking. The result is that, directly or  indirectly, 80 percent of our price system is influenced by the  rate of the Belgian franc against other currencies.    [Correspondent] The Belgian franc remains linked to the  German mark. But at the same time the Belgian Central Bank is  free to act without a green light from the Bundesbank. Is it  therefore free of any German influence?    [Verplaetse] Certainly not. This very morning I telephoned  Frankfurt and Amsterdam before making a decision. The aim is  not to receive orders but to agree on the extent of and reasons  for a decision. Also, in the past the Bundesbank was not  interested in what happened in Belgium.    [Correspondent] Has it changed its attitude?    [Verplaetse] I believe that the present president of the  Bundesbank, Hans Tietmayer, is more open to other countries than  his predecessor, Mr. Schlesinger.    [Correspondent] Do you think that foreigners are often  unaware of the situation of Belgium?    [Verplaetse] I am quite sure they are. And that is our own  fault, I would like to embark upon a very objective information  campaign together with our commercial banks.    [Correspondent] How do you explain the fact that short-term  interest rates are falling while long-term rates are rising?    [Verplaetse] There is an evident economic recovery in the  United States. Europe is coming out of recession. Private  investments are starting up again. There are also countries  which cannot manage to control public expenditure. In a world  where there is savings competition, how can you expect real  long-term interest rates to fall? I can see no mechanism that  could avoid this.  <H5>  The Social Pact? "I Remain Optimistic" </H5>   [Correspondent] Last autumn, you headed a group charged with  drawing up the social pact. How do you view this experience  today?    [Verplaetse] It was a good document and I am very proud of  it. But I was very naive to believe that everyone was in favor  of the social pact.    When the prime minister asked me to participate, my first  reaction was to refuse. Mr. Dehaene then confronted me with a  choice: Either you do as many of your colleagues would probably  do, pursue an orthodox monetary policy and consider that if it  doesn't work then it is all someone else's fault, or you tell us  what you believe to be the necessary conditions for total  success. I agreed provided I could do it with other people.    [Correspondent] Who you chose yourself?    [Verplaetse] I did not really have the right of veto, but I  did say yes or no. I knew them all except for one, all of them  perfectly reasonable people. It remains one of my best ever  memories of cooperation within a group.    [Correspondent] Were you not disappointed to see how things  turned out in the end?    [Verplaetse] I believed that all politicians, including the  opposition, would respond favorably to King Albert's appeal,  without criticizing those who had agreed to bear  responsibilities. I had not foreseen that, if I had I would  have perhaps refused the mission.    [Correspondent] The main complaint of the trade unions was  the absence of any job guarantees in your report.    [Verplaetse] You must allow for time between creating  incentives and achieving results. You must also understand that  an effort in one sector does not necessarily produce a result in  terms of jobs in that same sector. It is illusory to believe  that it does, and all members of the group were agreed on that  point. But I understand, while not agreeing with them, the  fears of the unions.    [Correspondent] How did you react to the refusal of the  trade  unions to sign the Central Bank's report?    [Verplaetse] With sadness. With respect to the social  dialogue, and it is that which is behind it all, I realized that  the leaders could not manage to convince their members. And I  understand that union leaders who do not have the support of  their members are unable to sign.    But I remain quite optimistic. I hope that later, when the  scars have healed, we will be able to look at the country's  fundamental problems without apportioning blame. Belgian  pragmatism will then make it possible to accept the inevitable  solutions.    [Correspondent] Are you thinking in terms of a new major  round of negotiations, all together round the table?    [Verplaetse] Perhaps not quite like that, but I remain  confident. The will is there. I have many scenarios in mind.  I will take initiatives, but behind the scenes....  <H5>  I Should Have Kept Quiet </H5>   [Correspondent] You are accused of making a few unfortunate  remarks during the summer. Do you accept this criticism?    [Verplaetse] No. I believe there was a misunderstanding.  Perhaps I should not have tried to reply to my colleagues at the  KUL [Louvain University]. In seeking to establish that  Belgium's situation was not comparable to that in 1981, I did  not state clearly enough that it was possible to improve the  situation without devaluation.    Indirectly, I confronted the social partners and the  politicians with their responsibilities. They had to take steps  to prevent a return to the situation in 1982. It was a risk I  took. On the other hand, I do believe it helped. All members  of the Central Bank committee were agreed. The Bank did its  duty. The government also had to make an effort.    [Correspondent] But it is you who made the statements.    [Verplaetse] I wanted to say that the economists at the KUL  were wrong. But I would have been much better advised to have  kept quiet at that point.  <H5>  "Eighty Percent Was Adopted" </H5>   [Correspondent] Your report inspired the global plan. Were  your recommendations adopted?    [Verplaetse] Eighty percent was adopted.    [Correspondent] Your opinion of privatization?    [Verplaetse] I believe that CGER [General Savings and  Retirement Bank]-Fortis is one of the very best examples of an  operation which offers every guarantee of success.    [Correspondent] Why do the trade unions always take such a  dim view of privatization?    [Verplaetse] Many of these people automatically assume that  private initiative neglects overall well-being. And that is not  necessarily true. An inefficient public corporation is more  socially damaging than anything.    [Correspondent] And the matter of anchorage?    [Verplaetse] I have never thought in terms of North or  South.  I am Belgian. A merger between the BBL [Bank Brussles Lambert]  and the ING [International Netherlands Group] would have led to  the ING controlling the BBL. But in the CGER-Fortis operation,  it is privatization which has brought the "Belgification" of the  Fortis group.    [Correspondent] And the control of Belgian companies by  foreign groups?    [Verplaetse] I would of course prefer the opposite, but I  believe it is inevitable.    [Correspondent] Why such harsh words from Mr. Van Den  Brande?    [Verplaetse] As you know, politicians sometimes have to use  very strong language.  <H5>  The ECU Decided in a Weekend </H5>   [Correspondent] How do you believe we are going to move from  the present European Monetary System (EMS) to a single currency?  Are we going to return to more restricted limits within the EMS?    [Verplaetse] That is a question I cannot answer. However, I  have never believed that the Twelve would be able to convert to  the single currency all at the same time. There are some  differences between Germany and Greece ...    If the European enterprise succeeds, and I hope and believe  it will, there will be a first stage when some of the Twelve  will move forward to the third stage of Economic and Monetary  Union.    [Correspondent] Do you think monetary union can be achieved  within the deadlines set?    [Verplaetse] What are these deadlines?    [Correspondent] At the latest, 1999.    [Verplaetse] If you read the texts carefully, you will see  that they do not say that.    [Correspondent] So that means that there will be at least a  two-speed Europe?    [Verplaetse] There will be a first stage which will involve  seven or eight partners. And I believe Belgium should be one of  them. After that, countries will join the group individually.    [Correspondent] How do you envisage the switch to a single  currency for the first group?    [Verplaetse] For me, the ideal situation would be to  organize  a weekend session between the heads of state and governments at  which it would be decided, after having consulted the governors  and finance ministers, to launch the third stage on Monday  morning. For me, that would be the surest scenario.    [Correspondent] And when would this weekend meeting of  government leaders be held?    [Verplaetse] I do not know. Everything will depend on  economic developments. It is easier to converge when things are  going well. We need more solid growth.    [Correspondent] Do you believe that Belgium can reduce the  public debt to no more than 3 percent of GDP by 1996?    [Verplaetse] The Central Bank's forecasts indicate that this  is possible. I believe that Belgium will achieve its aims. But  two points are less certain: Social security and the Regions  and Communities. But it should be possible to solve these  problems if we take the necessary measures.</p>

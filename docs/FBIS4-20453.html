The first was control group  (fed with water). The second and third groups were fed with  medicinal herbs according to prescriptions No. 1 and 2  respectively. The rats were tail suspended with heads down 25-30  degrees for 15 days. Mechanical properties of the soleus muscle  were determined with tesion and displacement transducers. Blood  flow in soleus muscle was determined with [.sup]51[/]Cr  labelled frog red cells.    The result indicated that blood flow increased in soleus  muscle in the second and third group rats but decreased in the  first group rats; peak force of isometric twitch and tetanic  contraction of soleus muscle increased in the second and third  group rats but decreased in the first group rats. There were  corresponding relationships between blood flow and peak force of  various kinds of muscle contractions. The correlations were:    Y[.sub]1[/] = 16.98 + 705.42x; Y[.sub]2[/] = 9.04 +  1183.76x    where: x -- blood flow in soleus muscle (ml/min.g);  Y[.sub]1[/] -- peak force of isometric twitch (N);  Y[.sub]2[/] -- peak force of isometric tetanic contraction  (N).    These results provided scientific basis for adopting  effective countermeasures against muscle atrophy during  weightlessness or simulated weightlessness.</p>

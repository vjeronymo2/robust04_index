			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: CAN HE PEDAL HIS OWN CANOE TO $25,000 PRIZE?  </P> <P> Sidney G. Shutt is ready to gobble up the $25,000 that E.I. du Pont de Nemours  &amp; Co. is offering to anyone who can travel 100 meters at 20 knots in a  pedal boat.  </P> <P> It just so happens that pedal boating is Shutt's expertise, a hobby that dates  back to the 63-year-old, retired Rockwell International engineer's youth.  </P> <P> "Theoretically, I see that it is possible," Shutt said. "What is really  exciting is the technical challenge. I'd say I'm a serious contender."  </P> <P> But he notes that others are in the running, including a team at the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  </P> <P> Shutt set a world record in 1988 in Visalia by traveling 200 meters in his  43-pound pedal boat at the rate of 15.91 m.p.h. This took place at a speed  competition sponsored by the International Human Powered Vehicle Assn.  </P> <P> Last year he took overall second in the group's competition in Adrian, Mich.,  which included a 100-meter sprint, a 120-meter slalom and a 50-meter lap race.  </P> <P> Besides boats, competitions sponsored by the group include bicycles, airplanes,  helicopters or anything else that is human-powered.  </P> <P> "I was 6 when I built my first boat with wood slats I took from our back-yard  fence in Long Beach," recollects Shutt, who now lives in Brea. "I didn't even  get in trouble for taking the slats. My parents were very encouraging to me."  </P> <P> Shutt said his parents later moved to Whittier where they frequented a grocery  store owned by President Nixon's parents.  </P> <P> "My parents liked to tell me that the store had a delivery service and Richard  Nixon used to deliver groceries to them."  </P> <P> His boats today are much more sophisticated, most of them built in the form of  hydrofoils. The kayak-like boats are on struts which raise them a foot above  the water to better skim the surface.  </P> <P> They are steered by hand controls on each side and are powered by pedaling  bicycle mechanisms that turn a propeller.  </P> <P> The Whittier College and USC graduate said he also likes sailboats but finds  more fun in his pedal boats, which he tests in the waters off the 15th Street  dock in Newport Beach.  </P> <P> "The boats are just a lot of fun and it's nice doing something that is a little  different," Shutt said. "I'm even getting to be competitive."  </P> <P> It's exciting to make the boat go faster, said Shutt, who takes his boat for  weekly runs with his son, Dave Shutt of Dana Point, in the waters off Newport  Beach.  </P> <P> At times, Shutt purposely tips the boat over to make sure he can right it.  "We've found out you can't tip it over unless you want to," he said.  </P> <P> His expertise in boats comes from building an assortment of sailboats and  trimarans. Although he hasn't built boats to sell, he doesn't discount that for  the future.  </P> <P> In the meantime, Shutt builds and gives away boats to friends. The boats are a  nice gift since the combination Fiberglas, resin, foam and aluminum craft cost  from $2,000 to $3,000 apiece.  </P> <P> "At the beginning I'd take old bicycle skeletons to power the boats and they  would do 6 or 7 knots," he said. "My, how times have changed."  </P> <P> Although retired, Shutt operates a small engineering business.  </P> <P> "I'm a regular retired guy who mows his lawn, reads and takes care of the  house," he said, "but I like to have an active day."  </P> <P> The 50th anniversary party for Dottie, 68, and Ken Sime, 71, turned into a  bonanza for needy people.  </P> <P> Instead of gifts for the La Habra couple, guests were asked to bring  non-perishable goods, which were later donated to the La Habra Resources Care  Center.  </P> <P> The 220 who attended brought 700 items.  </P> <P> The couple were married Oct. 9, 1940, but decided to hold the party early to  accommodate their two daughters and seven grandchildren who live out of state  and might not be able to attend because of school.  </P> <P> "People participated more than we thought they might," Ken Sime said. "It also  solved the problem of what to buy for a 50th anniversary. This way they were  able to give something that could be used in a very positive manner."  </P> <P> "The gift-giving idea wasn't an original idea, but it was a good one," he said.  </P></p>

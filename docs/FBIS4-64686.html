			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [George Jones report: "Tories `Will Be Positive on Europe'"] </F>   [Text] The Tories will fight next month's Euro-elections  on a "positive" manifesto which will make clear that the  European Union matters to Britain, Mr Douglas Hurd, the Foreign  Secretary, disclosed last night.    On the eve of today's local elections, he announced that the  Tory leadership had taken a strategic decision to mount a  popular Euro-campaign concentrating on "bread and butter issues"  to rebuild public confidence in the European Union.    A letter sent last night by Mr Hurd to the Conservative  Political Centre, and obtained by The Daily Telegraph, said jobs  and economic recovery would be the priority of a "distinctive  and positive" Tory manifesto.    "With Britain's performance outstripping that of our  partners  on growth, inflation and jobs, we have a good tale to tell,"  said Mr Hurd.    Other key themes include the importance of free trade;  completion of the single market; the drive for competitiveness  and deregulation; avoidance of unnecessary costs through the  Social Chapter; and initiatives against red tape, defrauding of  the EC budget and international crime.    Mr Hurd's letter disclosed that the tone of the Tory  campaign  will be in marked contrast to the last Euro-elections in 1989,  when Mrs Thatcher was accused of fighting a "negative" campaign,  with posters warning people against a "diet of Brussels" and  attacking the EC Commission.    His letter will be seen as a further attempt by the Tory  leadership to quash demands from the party's Euro-sceptics for  Britain to consider withdrawing from the EC if there are further  moves towards creating a federal State.    The European elections on June 9 will be a crucial mid-term  test for Mr Major's Government in the wake of today's local  council elections .    With the Tories running 21 points behind Labour in the  opinion polls, they fear many disillusioned supporters will stay  at home, so the party is braced for setbacks.    The closing stages of the Tory local elections campaign have  been over-shadowed by renewed party infighting over the  Government's stance towards a European single currency.    In his letter, Mr Hurd confirmed the manifesto -- due to be  published in two weeks' time -- will restate the agreed Cabinet  line that it will be for a future British Parliament to decide  on a single currency "when and if that decision has ever to be  taken".    Three times in the seven-page letter Mr Hurd emphasised the  need to fight a positive campaign.    He added: "We have taken a strategic decision to do just  that. Our supporters will only turn out and vote if we persuade  them that these elections matter because the European Union  matters to Britain and because the decisions of the European  Parliament affect us directly."    Mr Hurd has been in charge of efforts to draw up a manifesto  which will unite the party after the damaging divisions over  Maastricht. He said the Government's objective was to get to an  open, free trading, decentralised and popular European Union  which did not undermine the nation state.</p>

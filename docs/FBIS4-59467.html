			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Copenhagen correspondent Yig'al Rom and Smadar </F> Peri]    [Excerpts] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and PLO Chairman  Yasir 'Arafat will meet in Oslo on 18 May.    This will be the first meeting between the two men since the  signing of the Cairo agreement and the evacuation of Jericho.    The two men were invited to participate in the unveiling  ceremony of the statue of peace, which was donated to the  Norwegian trade unions' research institute by the Jimmy Carter  Institute, in recognition of Norway's role in promoting the  negotiations between the PLO and Israel.    Former President Jimmy Carter, will also attend the ceremony  which will be followed by a debate with Carter, 'Arafat, and  Peres on the ways to promote peace in the Middle East.    At an unofficial meeting with Labor Knesset Members held in  Vienna over the weekend, 'Arafat's adviser, Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi,  promised that the PLO would abrogate the clauses in the  Palestinian Covenant which call for the destruction of Israel.    [passage omitted]    Dr. al-Tibi said that the clauses would be nullified as soon  as certain logistic problems were resolved. He refused to be  more specific as to the nature of these problems.    "When the Palestine National Council convenes in Palestine,  these clauses will be changed," al-Tibi said.    Although no practical progress was reported in the talks,  the  participants said on 13 May that they had agreed on the need to  dismantle the settlements of Netzarim and Kfar Darom.</p>

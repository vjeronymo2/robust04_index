Clinton Draws Closer </F> to Europe"]    [Text] When President Clinton comes to Europe next week to  attend the NATO summit he is not going to offer much  satisfaction to the Poles, Czechs and Hungarians who are  knocking at the doors of NATO and demanding protection from a  possible resurgence of imperialism in Russia. But, to judge by  yesterday's major foreign policy speech in Milwaukee, delivered  by Vice President Al Gore because of the death of Mr Clinton's  mother, the President seems to have learnt a lot about the  dangers and challenges facing Europe -- and the importance of  facing them if America is to remain prosperous and secure.    In his ideas, if not yet in his actions, Mr Clinton clearly  wants his visit to Europe to mark a clean break from last summer  when Warren Christopher, his Secretary of State, could dismiss  the war in Bosnia as "a humanitarian crisis a long way from home  in the middle of another continent."    Europe's central importance for America was certainly the  welcome message yesterday from Milwaukee. "Nothing is more  important than our relationship with Europe," declared Mr  Clinton. But what was more convincing, and potentially  significant, was his ability to justify this airy statement to a  domestic American audience which still shows every sign of  wanting to turn its back on the outside world. Predictably Mr  Clinton explained that Europe was an "invaluable trading  partner" and a market for exports. It was also a possible  source of security threats and global instability and therefore  a potential drain on American government finances. But Mr  Clinton went beyond these cliches to emphasise a more  intangible, and even more important, feature of America's  relationship with Europe: a feature which lies at the heart of  the challenge for Europe and explains why the Atlantic will  always be more important to America than the Pacific, regardless  of the future flows of trade and the balance of world economic  growth.    What Europe now needed above all else, said Mr Clinton, was  a  new form of protection, built not on walls and barbed wire, but  on free commerce, democracy and respect for human diversity and  political dissent. After the decades of Communist uniformity  and repression, Europeans had rediscovered their ethnic and  religious differences. They now had to transform Europe's  diversity from a source of conflict into its great strength.  America's indispensable contribution was to show through its  own historical experience that it was possible "to build a  shared civic space large enough for all our differences." But  this ideal of a civic society, embracing diversity instead of  suppressing dissent, was not an American creation. It was  actually an import by Jefferson from European liberal  philosophy. And that philosophy not only underlies the American  Constitution; it also ultimately made inevitable America's  reluctant involvement in the two world wars.    It is because America shares its fundamental political  philosophy with West Europe that so much of 20th-century history  has revolved around the Atlantic alliance. And as Mr Clinton  correctly asserted, the greatest challenge facing America, as  well as West Europe, in the coming years, is to ensure that the  politics of Central Europe and the former Soviet Union are cast  irreversibly into the same liberal mould. Mr Clinton may not  yet know how to complete this historic task. But at least, as  he said in Milwaukee, he is finally willing "to put America's  shoulder to the wheel."</p>

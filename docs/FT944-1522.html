			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Cunard hit by storm of protest at QE2 refit A passenger on board the Queen Elizabeth 2 in mid-Atlantic said yesterday that the liner should 'never have set sail' with work still incomplete on a Pounds 30m refit. His comments came as ticket holders left behind by the liner besieged Cunard, its owner, demanding compensation. Cunard at first closed its doors to angry passengers outside its Pall Mall headquarters in London, but said later it had made compensation arrangements with the 500 passengers who were unable to leave with the QE2 from Southampton on Saturday because of refitting work on 100 cabins. The compensation is believed to be based on Cunard's original offer of a full refund by Christmas, with a free transatlantic cruise next year and Pounds 250 spending money. Some disappointed ticketholders said, however, that they still planned legal action against Cunard. Passengers on board the liner said Cunard was likely to receive many compensation claims even from those who had travelled. Last night Mr David Steene, who picketed the Cunard office acting as 'unelected mouthpiece' for angry ticketholders, said: 'I (and the other passengers) have received an unreserved apology for the distress and disappointment caused. 'I will be joining the QE2 with my family in New York and I have been assured by a director of Cunard . . . .that satisfactory individual alternative arrangements for all other passengers have been made and have been accepted by them.' One passenger on the liner said: 'Why they ever put to sea with the ship in the state it was in on Saturday I just don't know. Some passengers have got cabins without running water and with sinks that are blocked. They are having a torrid time.' He said that, contrary to statements from Cunard, public areas as well as cabins were still being refitted. The passenger, who paid more than Pounds 10,000 for tickets for his family, said: 'The whole of the third deck is being ripped up (with) carpets left, right and centre. There are workmen everywhere.' Since leaving Southampton the liner has hit force 10 gales, adding seasickness to the misery of the 600 passengers aboard a vessel which one contractor described as 'worse than a building site'. The QE2 was six hours late leaving Southampton but passengers have been told the bad weather is likely to make it 24 hours late into New York, where it was expected to arrive on Thursday. The majority will disembark there but some are to continue on a 117-day round-the-world cruise. About 300 passengers had their holidays cancelled late last week, when it became clear that the ship was not going to be ready. Hundreds of other passengers arriving at Southampton on Saturday were told they could not all be accommodated because of work in 100 cabins. About 190 passengers agreed to take compensation instead, but 80 boarded knowing their cabins were not ready. The Pounds 30m refit included renewing the interiors of all 960 passenger cabins, as well as building two new staircases, a pub and two nightclubs, and refitting other public areas  - all in 25 days. Mr Bill Childerstone, managing director of CLC, a ship outfitter in Southampton which completed its Pounds 2m contract on the QE2 in time, said the project was ambitious, but should have been achievable.</p>

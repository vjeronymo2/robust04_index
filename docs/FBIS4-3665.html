			<p>BFN     [Text] New Delhi, April 24 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill  Clinton has called for strong economic ties with India which has  offered "exciting possibilities for our bilateral trade and  economic relations."    in a letter to congressmen recently, Clinton said that his  administration was keen on enhancing Indo-U.S. cooperation in  trade, science and technology.    The Department of Commerce's big emerging markets study  should provide important help to companies seeking to enter the  Indian market, he said.    India has been identified by the U.S. Commerce Department as  among the 10 "big emerging markets," which hold tremendous  potential for boosting exports and profitable investments for  U.S. businesses.    Referring to the recent strain in Indo-U.S. relations over  the situation in Kashmir and human rights standards in India,  Clinton called for a pragmatic approach, saying that political  differences ought not to color the gamut of Indo-U.S. ties.</p>

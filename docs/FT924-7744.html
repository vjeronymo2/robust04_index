			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Mr Lamont's three Rs: FT writers ask whether the chancellor has restored political confidence, revived the economy and reassured the markets RESTORE As Mr John Major shovelled compost around a newly planted tree yesterday, he remarked: 'It's just occurred to me, I've been up to my neck in this stuff all month.' So the Press Association reports. In fact it's been two months, but the period of torment may be coming to an end, writes Joe Rogaly. Happily for the prime minister, his government has had a better half-week than any since September 16, Black Wednesday. His newly cheerful mood, brought about by the initial political response to the chancellor's Autumn Statement, may well last out the weekend and could signal the beginning of a little run of confidence in both Mr Major and Mr Norman Lamont. If so, Mr Lamont will take the credit. Thursday's statement has been widely praised as politically astute. Never mind the details. It is the package that counts. This gave Conservative MPs what they most wanted: a sense that the government may be recovering from the shock it suffered eight weeks ago. It has shown itself to be willing to try for an end to the recession. It may know what it is doing, and, more to the point, it may have found the nerve to get on with it. The anguished faces behind the front bench, so familiar to TV watchers, became relaxed as the chancellor spoke. When Mr Lamont sat down the Tories were radiant. The creation of this strangely optimistic political atmosphere was no accident. Badly shaken by the experience of rejection by the House when the closure of 31 coal mines was abruptly announced, the government took no chances. The economic package was debated in a series of long special sessions of the cabinet. Every minister's assent was demanded. The agreed story was told, over and over, to groups of MPs. They were well prepared for the details announced on Thursday. The fact that the main groups to be clobbered were low-paid public sector workers came as a relief to MPs who had been misled to expect deep cuts in social security, health and education. No wonder there were cheers. The obvious question is: 'Does this mean that Mr Major and Mr Lamont are now secure?' The short answer is no. They are, however, less insecure this morning than three days ago. Then, the prime minister's hold on his authority and the chancellor's on his job seemed precarious. Both demonstrated over the past two days that careful use of traditional political skills can pay off. The prospect that they could be hanged any morning has concentrated their minds wonderfully. It is hard to believe that the euphoria will last. Fresh accusations of ministerial duplicity could arise from studies of the breach of the embargo on arms sales to Iraq after 1988. The markets could deteriorate. The Edinburgh summit of European Community heads of government next month could easily go wrong. Even if the government navigates itself safely through to Christmas it must still win a parliamentary vote on financing the council tax. If local government spending is capped, services will deterioriate; if it is not, council tax will come to seem at least as onerous to households as the poll tax. Many homeowners in the south-east will pay more than under the community charge, since their houses are likely to be in the higher bands. Mr Major may soon find himself up to his neck in it again. REVIVE If the Treasury is to believed, Mr Norman Lamont's package will not cause much of a recovery over the next 12 months. The 0.75 per cent average growth expected for the non-oil economy next year will feel just like the recession to most people in Britain. Unemployment looks certain to rise above 3m from the present 2.87m in coming months, writes Peter Norman. But to focus on forecasts is to ignore the very considerable easing of the government's economic policy in recent weeks. Interest rates have fallen three percentage points and sterling's average value more than 13 per cent since the pound was forced to leave the European exchange rate mechanism. These numbers are more important for the future welfare of industry, homeowners and job seekers than the individual measures announced by Mr Lamont in the Autumn Statement. But the package will certainly do no harm because it is targeted on specific areas of weakness in the economy that have made the recession the longest since the second world war. Perhaps the most imaginative move is the plan to spend Pounds 750m between now and the end of March largely on buying 20,000 empty homes for social housing in a bid to stem the fall in house prices. There is a strong element of chance in the project, which, ministers say, will reduce the overhang of unsold houses by about a fifth. Nobody can tell how far the new source of demand for housing will encourage people considering buying a home to firm up their plans and so get the housing market moving again. But economists at Greenwell Montagu, the City brokers, believe this de facto nationalisation of part of the nation's housing stock will be positive. The programme should slow the fall in house prices by reducing the negative impact of auctioning repossessed homes. It should also produce business for local contractors who 'do up' houses and help building society balance sheets, encouraging them to cut mortgage rates. On the other hand, it is unclear how far house prices can recover so long as unemployment keeps growing - especially in the south-east. The direct effects of Thursday's measures on employment may be quite small. Many projects due for government support are capital- rather than labour-intensive while the increased investment allowances are unlikely to have a rapid impact on jobs. One exception could be the scheme allowing local authorities to spend capital receipts from asset sales. Ministers intend that the funds should be used to finance activities such as maintaining and refurbishing council houses which will provide contracts for small businesses. Industry and commerce took a generally positive view of the government's package. Mr Richard Brown, policy director at the British Chambers of Commerce, especially welcomed the Pounds 700m of extra export credit cover, which he said would encourage small companies to break into new markets. Mr Brown, a strong critic of government policy drift following Black Wednesday, said he was 'very pleased' with Mr Lamont's package. That reaction will be music to the chancellor's ears. He insisted yesterday that the government cannot 'press a button' to make the economy grow. If the latest measures boost confidence, they may at last create the conditions for recovery - even though they were born of political desperation and economic policy failure. REASSURE That the equity and bond markets should have all their fun in the anticipation rather than the event is quite normal, writes Barry Riley. Yesterday's markets looked dull in comparison to their behaviour earlier in the week, but that did not mean that the City's investment professionals were disappointed - just a little confused. The markets are being pulled in different directions. Many investors want economic growth, but on the other hand some are scared of the high levels of public borrowing. Fears about inflation are abating but opinion remains divided and the Treasury's forecast of a 3 3/4 per cent underlying inflation rate in a year probably splits the field. Pretty well everybody is in favour of lower short-term interest rates which tend to stoke up the longer-term markets in equities and gilts. Thursday's one-point cut in base rates was welcomed, but is widely seen as just a step on the road to 6 per cent by the end of the year and perhaps 5 per cent next spring. This year the Treasury, battered and bruised by its mistakes over the past 12 months, has carefully pitched its autumn economic forecast in line with the City consensus, which leaves the Square Mile little the wiser. As the Treasury pointed out, the personal sector's excessively high debt ratio, which is at the root of Britain's recessionary problems, has only declined fractionally so far. So although the Treasury is forecasting a slight rise in consumer spending, others disagree. Among the big City securities firms, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew appears to be one of the more bearish, suggesting that the upturn will disappoint even the modest hopes of the Treasury, and that next year's public sector borrowing requirement will be more like Pounds 54bn than the suggested Pounds 44bn. Greenwell Montagu is also pitching its growth estimates lower than those of Mr Lamont. On the other hand S G Warburg thinks the caution is being overdone and economic growth in 1993 will be 1 1/2 rather than 1 per cent. In fact the City's forecasters - who in aiming much too high have mostly got this year's gross domestic product wrong by a massive three percentage points - do not appear to have much of a clue about how to predict the recovery, but they have prejudices which greatly affect their investment judgments. Those who believe in growth are naturally apprehensive about the scale of projected government borrowing. Even those doubtful about the speed of the recovery are worried that the gilts market will be buried in new issues and long-term interest rates will be forced up some time later next year or in 1994. In the equity market the question is how strongly earnings will recover in 1993. Expectations are in fact quite high, on the basis of cost-cutting and a devaluation boost to overseas and export earnings. But overall economic growth of 1 per cent is not really an exciting foundation for a decent bull market, and expectations are muted. As for inflation, the monetarists are generally quite optimistic because the money supply has been growing only very slowly. Some non-monetarists are still worried that imported inflation will feed through and that the government may be forced to accept further depreciation of the currency in 1993. Perhaps it was all best summed up by the economists at NatWest Treasury and Capital Markets: 'Cut now, pay later.'</p>

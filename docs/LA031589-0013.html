			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. POLICY PUNISHES 'KILLING FIELDS' SURVIVORS;  </P> <P> LINGERING ANTI-VIETNAMESE BIAS PUSHES AMERICA TO OPEN DOOR TO KHMER ROUGE  </P> <P> U.S. policy toward Cambodia is immoral, impractical and, above all,  undesirable; our nation has probably never had a policy so unfortunate.  </P> <P> As our government and the Chinese government know full well -- but prefer not  to dwell upon -- the Vietnamese were brutally and repeatedly attacked by Pol  Pot and the Khmer Rouge from at least September, 1977, and tried for more than  a year to get the Chinese to mediate and the United Nations to support a  demilitarized zone. (On May 10, 1978, Phnom Penh radio was actually calling on  the people to exterminate the Vietnamese race: "In terms of numbers, one of us  must kill 30 Vietnamese . . . ."). When Vietnamese efforts to negotiate failed,  Vietnam dealt with these attacks as the United States dealt with Japan after  World War II -- overthrowing the Pol Pot regime in 1979 and constructing a new  and less hostile government. In the process, the Vietnamese saved the Cambodian  people from extermination by the Khmer Rouge.  </P> <P> Under these circumstances, it is an extraordinary tribute to the  anti-Vietnamese feeling in Beijing and Washington, and the influence of these  two superpowers, that the international community continues to call this  Vietnamese action "illegal" when so many analogous cases are called  "self-defense" and promptly recognized.  </P> <P> This policy is intensely immoral since it has led us, under Chinese pressure,  to permit the Khmer Rouge -- who have committed the most genocidal actions of  this century -- to hold the U.N. seat as the legitimate government of Cambodia.  This denied the survivors of the Cambodian holocaust access to U.N. agencies  such as WHO, UNESCO and the U.N. Development Programme. And it kept the Khmer  Rouge in business killing civilians from its base camps in Thailand and  committing the same atrocities its had before on all who came under its  control. The Western effort to give this policy a face-lift some years ago by  pressuring Prince Sihanouk into a coalition with the Khmer Rouge cost still  more lives as innocent peasants were misled into volunteering for what they  thought was a Sihanouk movement only to find themselves under Khmer Rouge  control.  </P> <P> During a recent visit to Hanoi and Phnom Penh, it also became clear how  impractical and undesirable our policy has been.  </P> <P> Premier Hun Sen's government is not about to "dismantle" its 10-year-old  government in return for the "dismantling" of the Khmer Rouge governmment,  which does not control an inch of Cambodian territory but is simply a U.N.  fiction.  </P> <P> The ASEAN governments, to whose policy the U.S. position has been blindly  hitched, are reversing themselves rapidly. The Hun Sen government is being  received in the "front-line" state of Thailand and is receiving Thai generals  in return.  </P> <P> Predictably, the less anti-Vietnamese ASEAN states are scrambling to open some  kind of relations with Hanoi and Phnom Penh now that the political dam has  broken. Even Prince Sihanouk has given up on the negotiations that are so often  pressed by us in his name. He did not attend the Jakarta talks last year and  called them a "cynical comedy acted out shamelessly by the Vietnamese  colonialists and their valets in Phnom Penh." In return, the ASEAN participants  simply make no reference to this presumed leader.  </P> <P> But, above all, U.S. policy is worse than a crime; it is a mistake.  </P> <P> No Khmer government will ever want less than independence from the Vietnamese.  The perpetual triumph of nationalist feelings over ideology in that part of the  world has been proven definitively by the tensions and fighting that broke out  immediately upon the end of the Vietnamese war -- with communists fighting  communists. And as Hun Sen told me in February, his government wants its own  "hat" and is not acting like other socialist governments. Free enterprise is  fully accepted as is freedom of religion. There is as much freedom of speech  and action, I believe, as there was under Prince Sihanouk's regime.  </P> <P> Furthermore, according to foreign observers with whom I spoke in Phnom Penh,  the Hun Sen government is as disciplined and devoted to the public needs as can  be expected and more so than the Lon Nol and Sihanouk governments. It has  brought the country from ground zero, with few educated persons left from the  Pol Pot genocide, to the point where the government is running. And progress  continues apace.  </P> <P> The horse we are backing, Prince Sihanouk, as mercurial as ever, consults with  no one and never abides criticism. There is not the slightest sign that he  would run a democratic government -- he has always believed he was the father  of his people, not their elected leader.  </P> <P> In Indochina last month, I met with Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach  and Deputy Premier Gen. Vo Nyugen Giap, as well as many observers in Phnom  Penh. They all see that the withdrawal of Vietnamese forces will leave the West  with nothing to complain about while it continues to support the Khmer Rouge  coalition. They are right to think that this leaves the West and the Chinese in  an intensely embarrassing blind alley.  </P> <P> I believe that our government would find Hun Sen much more palatable than  Prince Sihanouk, infinitely more reliable and more likely to last. He wants,  obviously, to have relations with us and has offered through a representative  to discuss, in particular, the the remains of Americans that his government has  found.  </P> <P> Spooked by communism as our country has been, and by the loss of the Vietnamese  war, it is, perhaps, understandable that we did not recognize the People's  Republic of Kampuchea at the outset. But there is little choice now. And the  PRK is running the best government that tortured Cambodia has ever had.  </P> <P> How long are we going to continue punishing the poor, punishing the victims of  this holocaust, in the name of a patently distorted application of  international law?  </P></p>

			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / You win some, you lose some: UK pension scheme members have gained security, but may have lost some rewards When the former directors of Belling, the UK cooker manufacturer, were trying to salvage their ailing company in 1991, they turned to the pension scheme. The directors, who were also pension scheme trustees, bought a Belling subsidiary for the scheme with Pounds 5.5m of pension assets, and borrowed Pounds 2.1m from the fund. Belling went into liquidation the following year and the liquidators valued the subsidiary at Pounds 2.5m. Scheme members turned to the courts to recoup their money. So far, they have recovered little. This is one of the most serious cases to rock the pensions industry, which has not yet regained public confidence after the disappearance of more than Pounds 440m from pension funds controlled by the late Robert Maxwell. Last week, the government acted to fill some of the most gaping holes in the regulatory net which permitted Maxwell's deception to take place. In addition to giving an oversight of pension schemes, the proposed legislation would alter some aspects of state benefits which may, in some cases, reduce the benefits paid to pensioners. The overriding question for pensioners and scheme members is whether they will be better off when the proposals become law. The white paper tries to balance improved safety for members against the interests of employers who do not want to bear higher costs. The main points are: Creation of a pensions regulator to be funded by a levy on the pensions industry estimated at Pounds 10m a year. The regulator would have the power to discipline and set fines for schemes which break the rules. There is widespread agreement that the regulator is central to improving the safety of schemes. Regulation would be funded by the pensions industry through a board selected from the industry. It would rely on 'whistle-blowing' by professional advisers to scheme - actuaries, accountants and solicitors - to alert it to wrongdoing. 'Professional people are naturally reluctant to be whistle-blowers for people who are their clients and their source of income,' said Mr Stewart James, chairman of the Association of Pensions Lawyers and partner at solicitors Rowe and Maw, and also a member of the Goode Committee, whose proposals the white paper reflects. He thinks the idea of the regulator is not as effective, therefore, as it could be. Minimum solvency standards aim to ensure that schemes have enough assets to meet their pensions obligations. These begin to take effect in April 1997 and schemes would have five years to meet them fully. If they meet at least 90 per cent of the standard, they may take another three years to bring them up to 100 per cent. But there is a cost to members of this added security. This is because the method used to calculate the value of assets - which adds up the cash equivalent needed to buy an annuity that would provide the member with the promised benefits at retirement - means that those who leave schemes early will have lower transfer values. The accountancy firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand estimates that the new calculations of cash equivalents would mean that a 30-year-old leaving a scheme would have a 25 per cent lower transfer value once the new rules take effect. A compensation scheme for fraud or misappropriation would be financed by employers and cover up to 90 per cent of any missing assets. Scheme members would have the right to appoint at least one-third of a board of trustees, with small schemes guaranteed at least one member trustee. This proposal should improve the confidence of the average pension scheme member. First, members would be able to appoint trustees who cannot be removed by the employer. They should be in a position to spot inappropriate activity early. Mr Nigel Preston, partner in the pensions practice at consulting actuaries R. Watson, said: 'I've seen schemes with member trustees, and they do improve the quality of administration. They certainly limit the ability of the bad guys to put their hands in the till.' In addition, the presence of member trustees forces the employer to think twice about securing the use of a scheme surplus entirely for his own benefit, Mr Preston says. Thus, not only may members feel safer after the new legislation, they may also find they are better off. Abolition of the Guaranteed Minimum Pension from April 1997, which guarantees that at least a portion of each deferred pension rises in value in line with salary increases, until it is ready to be drawn. Instead, employers would have to increase pensions in payment by 5 per cent or the retail price index, whichever is lower. The GMP is currently intended to ensure that occupational schemes provide at least a portion of deferred benefits, which rise each year in line with earnings, and which are equal in value to those provided by the State Earnings Related Scheme. Schemes which are 'contracted out' of Serps are allowed to receive rebates of National Insurance Contributions along with their members. According to data from the National Association of Pension Funds, some 41 per cent of employers are voluntarily increasing pensions in payment each year by the amount required under the new law. A further 20 per cent are increasing pensions by an even more generous level. Indeed, only 2 per cent of all schemes have increases of less than 3 per cent each year. Ms Penny Webster, partner at Bacon and Woodrow, the consulting actuaries, said the abolition of GMP could cause significant reductions in the pensions received by many people. In particular, those who change jobs frequently would be hard hit. That is because, although a 'frozen' pension is only required to be uprated by 5 per cent each year, the GMP portion of that pension must be increased by 7 per cent or by the level of earnings inflation, which is typically 1 1/2 to 2 per cent above retail price inflation. 'Let's say a 35-year-old man leaves a scheme with 30 years to go until retirement,' Ms Webster says. 'Considering that GMP can be 40 per cent of his total pension, that man's final pension will be reduced by 15 per cent.' Those who stand to benefit are those whose employers provide little or no inflation-proofing for pensions, and who have worked most of their lives for a single employer - a minority of the UK 10m scheme members. The response to the white paper has been mixed. The NAPF has broadly endorsed it, saying it strikes a balance between improving security for scheme members and limiting costs to employers. But trade unions have said it does not go nearly far enough in protecting scheme members. The answer to the question of whether the average scheme member is better off is: maybe. For while there is a greater certainty that promised benefits will be delivered, they may prove in the end to be less generous than at present. It will be up to scheme members to decide whether they think the trade-off is worth it.</p>

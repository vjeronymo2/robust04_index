			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Bonds, figures and futures depress Dow Wall Street A fall in bond prices, a downward revision in first quarter economic growth figures, and selling in the futures markets combined to drive share prices lower yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 27.40 at 3,527.43. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended down 2.21 at 450.21, while the Amex composite finished 0.71 lower at 438.22, and the Nasdaq composite down 4.06 at 700.53. Trading volume on the NYSE was light at 209m shares. After setting records on consecutive days, analysts expected Dow stocks to run into profit-taking yesterday morning. It was no coincidence that the three big stocks which provided almost all of the gains for the Dow on Thursday - Chevron, Caterpillar and Texaco - were all lower on heavy selling yesterday. Investors remain nervous about the markets' recent gains, unsure as to whether the economy and the outlook for corporate earnings justify prices at such high levels. Yesterday's news that the original estimate of a 1.8 per cent growth in gross domestic product during the first quarter had been revised down to only 0.9 per cent seemed to confirm that economic recovery this year is advancing at a slow pace. It was these concerns about the economy, allied to some selling of stock-index futures, which together with profit-taking pushed equities lower across the board. Later in the day, a sharp fall in bond prices only added to the decline. Chevron fell Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 88 1/8 , Texaco gave up Dollars 5/8 at Dollars 63 7/8 and Caterpillar dropped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 71 5/8 , all on profit-taking following recent gains. Steel stocks featured with USX dropping Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 43 after a federal appeals court upheld a judgment in an anti-trust case against a railroad once owned by USX. The group will be responsible for paying the damages, estimated at Dollars 630m, unless the supreme court overturns the ruling. LTV, which is the main beneficiary of the judgement, rose initially but ended steady at Dollars 1/4 in huge volume of 13m shares. National Steel fell Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 18 1/2 after Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock from a 'buy' to a 'market performer', while Bethlehem Steel was also affected by selling, falling Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 19 3/8 . Concern about the economic outlook affected airline stocks: AMR, parent of American Airlines, fell Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 70 3/4 , Delta tumbled Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 57 3/8 and UAL dropped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 134. Jenny Craig rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 16 on hopes that the company, which operates weight loss centres, will benefit from the financial troubles afflicting one of its main competitors, Nutri-System. Canada TORONTO share prices ended little changed in moderate trading. The composite index was off 3.28 points, or 0.08 per cent, to 3866.44, for a gain on the week of about 31.5 points. Advancing issues edged declines by 361 to 327, volume of 59.080 shares was down from Thursday's 67.858 shares, and trading value was CDollars 446m against CDollars 706.6m. The banking group fell 1.08 per cent to post the largest decline among sub-groups. Golds gained 1.30 per cent.</p>

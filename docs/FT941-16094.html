			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Free vote on capital punishment The government is to allow MPs a free vote on capital punishment as part of its drive against crime, it was announced last night. Mr David Maclean, home office minister of state, said the vote would be the only opportunity for MPs to express a view on hanging in the current parliament, which must end by 1997. The vote will form part of the debate on the criminal justice bill, which the government claims will give the UK the most comprehensive framework possible for fighting crime. Mr Maclean also confirmed that MPs will be given a free vote on proposals to reduce the age of consent for homosexuals from 21. The last Commons vote on capital punishment was in December 1990, when a Conservative backbench attempt to impose the death penalty for the murder of a police officer was rejected by 350 votes to 215. Conservative supporters of the death penalty believe capital punishment is unlikely to be reinstated. Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, said the bill - the cornerstone of the troubled 'back to basics' programme - would implement 18 of the 27 law-and-order initiatives launched at last year's Tory party conference. Mr Howard said these initiatives rested on 'basic, commonsense principles' which would make life 'safer for the law-abiding and more difficult for the criminal'. The bill was given an unopposed second reading after MPs rejected by 319 votes to 275 a Labour amendment calling for stronger crime prevention measures and an independent review authority to monitor miscarriages of justice. Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, said the bill's purpose was to provide balance and strategy to a government that lacked both. 'What people want after 14 years is not another dose of Tory rhetoric but effective actions that work,' he said. Mr Blair appeared to surprise Mr Howard by revealing that Labour would abstain in the second-reading vote if its own amendment was rejected. Mr Howard argued that Labour's stance showed it could not make up its mind on the wide range of proposals covered by the bill. When Mr Blair 'sits on his hands tonight, the British public will see that his rhetoric is just hot air,' the home secretary said. Mr Howard attempted to defuse criticism of the failure to include moves to set up an independent review authority by pledging 'shortly' to publish a consultation paper on the subject. The home secretary emphasised that he accepted a recent Royal Commission recommendation that such a body be established and was 'determined' to ensure that effective machinery was set up. But he said a number of issues, including the relationship between the new authority and both ministers and the Court of Appeal, had still to be resolved. These matters were being taken forward urgently.</p>

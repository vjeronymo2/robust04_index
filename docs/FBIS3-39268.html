			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "An Ominous Status Quo"] </F>   [Text] The agreement reached in December does not include  any decision pertaining to the maritime transportation sector.  The signatories of the GATT have begun a new round of  negotiations on this single issue. An agreement should be  reached by the end of 1996. Between now and that time, the  status of most favored nation will not apply to this sector.    Europe had proposed opening up maritime transportation (with  the exception of coastal shipping between two ports in a given  country) to competition. But while the European nations have  almost entirely opened up their markets, they have not been able  to obtain reciprocal treatment from the Americans, who have a  very protectionist policy in this sector. For a long time, the  Americans in this sector have benefited from federal legislative  protection of their activities, which gives them priority on the  domestic market. The negotiators submitted minimal offers with  regard to the opening up of their markets. Countries like Japan,  Mexico, and Korea followed suit. Without result. The European  shipowners reject the institutionalization of the current  situation, wherein they come up against protectionism in  numerous countries, while at the same time competitors can  attack them on their own home ground. Therefore no offer was  included in the global accord, and new negotiations will be  launched.    Between now and the end of 1996, none of the parties should  be able to strengthen their protectionist arsenals, except by  means of retaliatory measures. But the Central Committee of  French Shipowners (CCAF) would have preferred a freeze, followed  by the dismantling of the protectionist regulations.    According to one market analyst, the heaviest losers as a  consequence of this accord are likely to be the Asian countries,  Taiwan in particular (Evergreen is the largest international  shipowner), and the countries of northern Europe, such as  Denmark, for example. Greece will also be affected.</p>

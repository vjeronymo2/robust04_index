			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed Final Judgment, in IV (E), forbids Microsoft from licensing covered products <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  through agreements conditioned on ``(1) the licensing of any *&blank;*&blank;* other product.'' However, this provision explicitly states that ``this provision in and of itself shall not be construed to prohibit Microsoft from developing integrated products.'' The evidence developed by the government during this investigation would not, in its view, support a broader injunction. Activity of this sort requires case by case analysis, and a broad injunction against such behavior generally would not be consistent with the public interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> We note that the developers' toolkit for Microsoft Windows NT 3.5, the product that is the subject of Micro System Options comment, is not a ``Covered Product'' as defined by the proposed Final Judgment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Comment of Anthony R. Martin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A comment from Anthony R. Martin states that since the settlement of this case, Microsoft has begun to engage in new and different forms of monopolistic conduct. As an example of this, Mr. Martin complains that Microsoft is pressuring software suppliers into switching from the current version of Windows to the next version of Windows which will be released shortly. Mr. Martin suggests that the government may have ``settled too soon, for too little,'' and that it should reopen its investigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The United States does not believe that the possibility that Microsoft might in the future engage in new forms of anticompetitive behavior is a sufficient reason to reject the proposed Final Judgment before the Court now. Obviously, the Department cannot, in a Consent Decree, proscribe every conceivable kind of anticompetitive conduct in which a firm might engage in the future. It certainly cannot allege in a complaint anticompetitive conduct that has not yet occurred. In addition, the government cannot be expected to continue its investigations and litigation indefinitely, without resolution, on the theory that the defendant might, at some point, begin to engage in additional anticompetitive practices. The Department considered every allegation of anticompetitive behavior that came to its attention during the period of its investigation, and brought an action challenging the practices that it thought should be challenged on the facts then before it. The proposed Decree meets the Department's competitive concerns as of the date of filing of the proposed Decree. Should Microsoft at some future date begin to engage in new forms of anticompetitive conduct, the government can and will initiate a new investigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Comment of IDEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One comment does relate directly to the terms of the proposed decree. That comment, submitted by IDEA, an OEM which has licensed software from Microsoft, contends that its license agreements from January 1, 1989 to the present have resulted in more than $2,000,000 in prepaid royalties. IDEA suggests that the decree should contain provisions ordering Microsoft to refund such prepaid royalties to IDEA and similarly situated companies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This comment apparently concerns the ``minimum commitment'' feature found in the many operating system software licenses Microsoft has entered into with OEMs. The minimum commitments create ``take or pay'' contracts in which OEM's commit themselves to pay Microsoft not less than a particular amount of money in a particular time period. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For example, an OEM under a pet-processor license that expected to sell 10,000 personal computers a year for the three-year term of its license and negotiated a royalty rate of $25 for each computer it shipped containing a microprocessor identified in its license agreement might have a minimum commitment of $250,000 per year. If the OEM only sold 8,000 personal computers in the first year, it would still owe Microsoft $250,000. If it sold 11,000, it would owe Microsoft $275,000 (11,000 times $25).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed Final Judgment prohibits Microsoft from entering into license agreements that contain minimum commitments (section IV (F)) and from enforcing any minimum commitment in existing license agreements (section IV (J) (2)). These prohibitions were included because of concerns that minimum commitments could be structured in ways that create anticompetitive disincentives for OEMs to make incremental purchases of non-Microsoft operating systems.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Competitive Impact Statement, pp. 10, 14. In addition, Section IV (I) of the proposed Final Judgment provides all OEMs the right to terminate existing license agreements for MS-DOS and Windows immediately, without penalty. However, the government did not believe that it was necessary, in order to create the conditions for competition in the operating system software market on an ongoing basis, to require Microsoft to refund ``unused'' royalty payments that were paid under minimum commitment provisions applicable to contract periods prior to the filing of the government's case. The principal goal of the government's action was to ensure that OEMs' purchasing decisions in the future would not be distorted by the existence of anticompetitive license terms. Refunds of royalties paid by OEMs in prior periods would not have affected prospective decisions about which operating system products they should buy now and in the future. Further, such refunds arguably could produce a windfall for some OEMs without producing corrective or remedial procompetitive impact. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For example, an OEM under a per-processor license that expected to sell 10,000 personal computers a year for the three-year term of its license and negotiated a royalty rate of $25 for each computer it shipped containing a microprocessor identified in its license agreement might have a minimum commitment of $250,000 per year.

Comment of J. Adam Burden  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A comment by J. Adam Burden complains about the ``ridiculous action brought forth towards Microsoft.'' Mr. Burden contends that Microsoft's large market share can be attributed to the fact that software developers like to have an operating system standard, and that the government has penalized Microsoft for its success. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

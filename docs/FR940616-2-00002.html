The PA sets forth proposed procedures for meeting the requirements of section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (Pub. L. 89&hyph;665) (NHPA or the Act) and other provisions of the Act as amended in 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;575). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Council is an independent Federal agency that advises the President and Congress on matters of historic preservation. OSM is the Federal agency within the Department of the Interior created by the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA) to implement SMCRA's requirements concerning the regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations and the reclamation of abandoned mine lands. OSM's SMCRA responsibilities include conducting oversight of State administration of approved State regulatory programs in the 24 primacy States and providing regulatory grants to primacy States to administer and enforce their regulatory programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM initiated consultation with the Council in April 1993 to explore options for implementing its responsibilities under the 1992 Amendments to the NHPA, particularly in relation to State permitting actions and related activities. Over the past year, the Council, OSM, and NCSHPO have been working together to develop the proposed PA as a potential compliance mechanism for implementing OSM's responsibilities under the 1992 NHPA Amendments and the 1991 judicial decision in Indiana Coal Council, Inc. v. Lujan (744 F. Supp. 1385 [D.DC. 1991]). A PA is one of the options set forth in the Council's regulations at &sect;36 CFR section 800.13 for a Federal agency to tailor section 106 review procedures to meet its historic preservation obligations in lieu of the standard process set forth at 36 CFR &sect;800.4&hyph;6. The 1992 amendments to the Act clarified that State regulatory programs administered pursuant to a delegation or approval by a Federal agency, such as OSM's approval of State programs and delegation of surface coal mining regulation to State Regulatory Authorities (SRAs), are Federal undertakings subject to section 106 of the Act. Therefore, OSM is now responsible for ensuring that the effects on historic properties of each State permitting action are appropriately considered. Each SRA must assist OSM in fulfilling its NHPA responsibilities as a standard condition of each regulatory grant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed PA sets forth procedures for implementing OSM's NHPA section 106 responsibilities as an alternative to the standard section 106 review process. The PA covers State permitting activities in the 24 primacy States and on Federal lands in cooperative agreement States, where the States exercise regulatory jurisdiction over such lands. The PA also covers OSM permitting actions in Federal program States, and on Federal lands in non-cooperative agreement States, where OSM is the regulatory authority. The terms of the PA do not apply to OSM's regulatory activities on Indian lands or where National Historic Landmark properties may be affected. In these situations, the standard process at 36 CFR &sect;800.4&hyph;6, applies. In contrast to the standard section 106 review process, the PA is intended to expedite and streamline the process by granting more decisionmaking and implementation authority to the States. The proposed PA provides for Council and OSM involvement in a proposed surface coal mining permitting action only if disputes arise that are unresolvable at the State level or if a member of the public requests such involvement. The PA also encourages SRAs and State Historic Preservation Officers to develop and formalize their own State-specific procedures based on those contained in the PA. Finally, the PA establishes a monitoring and reporting system whereby OSM can ensure compliance with section 106 requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Publication of this proposed PA and request for comments on its scope, efficacy, and adequacy is part of the public participation process as set forth at 36 CFR &sect;800.13(c) of the Council's regulations with the purpose of gathering information, comments, and suggestions on the proposed PA. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR COPIES OF THE PROPOSED PA CONTACT:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Thomas M.

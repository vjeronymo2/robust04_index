			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Military homes to go private Government plans to transfer service personnel homes into the private sector could raise around Pounds 500m through an arrangement described yesterday as 'a sort of finance lease' by Lord Cranbourne, the defence minister. The deal, which is essential to bridge a gap of more than Pounds 500m in next year's defence budget, involves creating a non-profit-making housing trust to own and manage the homes. The aim is to structure the deal so that money raised to finance the transfer and modernise the dilapidated housing stock falls outside the public sector borrowing requirement. To achieve this the Treasury will have to be convinced that the lenders have assumed enough of the risk for the deal to amount to more than creative accounting. Generally, Treasury experts have not regarded finance leases as involving sufficient transfer of risk. Under the plan, 68,000 armed services married quarters will be transferred under 30-year leases to the housing trust. The trust will be independent of the defence ministry, but will contract with it to provide accommodation for married service personnel and to improve its quality. Capital for the deal will be raised in the City, secured against the future stream of rental income. 'Lenders will take the risk that the basis of paying rents changes, or that the size of the married quarters estate changes,' said Lord Cranbourne. Major-General James Johnstone, chairman of the new trust, said yesterday that City soundings indicated that the money could be raised without distorting current housing market finance. Housing associations currently raise around Pounds 1bn a year to finance their building programmes and purchase local authority homes. The trust will seek to find tenants for married quarters not immediately required by the armed services. Fourteen per cent of the stock is currently empty and it will sell off homes surplus to requirements. 'Housing is not a core activity for the ministry of defence,' said Lord Cranbourne. 'The trust will bring in private housing management skills as well as giving access to private capital.' Service personnel rents will continue to be set by the armed forces pay review body. The ministry will top up the rents to levels comparable with those charged by local authorities and housing associations. The form of the new trust has yet to be decided, the minister added. The options include an industrial and provident society, a chartered corporation or a company limited by guarantee.</p>

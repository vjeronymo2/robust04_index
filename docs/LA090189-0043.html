			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MUSIC  </P> <P> Famed tenor Luciano Pavarotti has been a no-show once too often at Chicago's  Lyric Opera, and will sing there no more, opera officials said Thursday.  Pavarotti had been scheduled to sing the role of Cavardossi in Puccini's  "Tosca" on Sept. 16 to open the Lyric's 35th anniversary season but canceled  because of a persistent inflammation of his sciatic nerve, said Herbert  Breslin, his manager. This upset the people at the Lyric. "The Lyric Opera is  now unwilling to take the risk of one more cancellation by Mr. Pavarotti,"  general manager Ardis Krainik said, noting that the tenor has canceled 26 of 41  scheduled appearances at the Lyric since 1981. "I love Luciano but because of  the number of cancellations here I have no choice. I got to the point where I  couldn't count on anything from him." ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

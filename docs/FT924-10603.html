			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Cabinet to meet on spending curbs THE CABINET will meet on Monday afternoon for the first in an intensive series of discussions to resolve the distribution of public spending for 1993-94, amid signs that ministers may find it hard to agree where the axe should fall. More than an hour of the extended cabinet meeting yesterday was spent discussing the options put forward by EDX, the public-spending committee chaired by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, for keeping to the Pounds 244.5bn spending target. Downing Street said no decisions had been taken in this preliminary discussion, but cabinet ministers all reaffirmed the fundamental importance of keeping tight control of public spending. The decision to carry on discussing public expenditure at cabinet level rather than referring matters back to EDX raises speculation that all the choices on offer are politically unappetising. This route ensures that all senior ministers are irrevocably signed up to unpopular judgments. Signals about the pressure points came in the Commons yesterday afternoon, as Mr John Major underlined the importance of capital projects in the spending round. His reference to real-term reductions 'in many social benefits' under the last Labour government was seen as a sign that social security spending remains in the firing line. In spite of the pressure on public-sector pay, some ministers are keen that if there is the slightest room for manoeuvre then the pay review bodies for groups such as teachers and nurses should still operate, even though they would do so within a very tight margin on the pay bill. Others still believe, however, that if there is to be a pay freeze, then there is a severe disadvantage in having independent bodies advising that such groups deserve 5 per cent or 7 per cent pay increases. Yesterday's discussion represented the first formal occasion when spending ministers have been able to compare the sacrifices they are being asked to make in their departmental programmes with the casualties in other departments. Some ministers have already indicated that their readiness to see cuts in their budgets will depend on the merits of the cause for which their spending is being put under pressure. The November 12 date for the Autumn Statement represents a tough deadline for the end of the discussions. Announcements on local-government spending and on the uprating of social security benefits are likely to follow early in the next week.</p>

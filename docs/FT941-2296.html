			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Rescue plans 'impractical' Government proposals intended to help companies facing financial difficulties to survive could be counter-productive, the British Bankers' Association said yesterday. Mr Brian Pitman, chief executive of Lloyds bank and association vice-president, said: 'There is a real risk the proposals would work in the opposite direction.' The association gave a cautious welcome to the consultation paper on insolvency when it was published by the Department of Trade and Industry late last year. The paper suggested that companies should have a 'breathing space' of 28 days, renewable for up to three months, while they tried to find proposals acceptable to creditors representing at least 75 per cent of their debts. Mr Pitman said yesterday legislation that impaired the rights of a bank  - or another lender which had taken a floating charge - could lead to banks reducing the amounts they were prepared to lend against stock and debts. He criticised the proposal under which banks would have to give seven days' notice of their intention to appoint receivers as 'impractical'. The association also has reservations about proposals in a DTI consultation paper on late payment of commercial debt. The paper includes the possibility of introducing a statutory right to interest on late payment. The Institute of Directors said a statutory right would alter the behaviour of companies which found it advantageous to pay after the due date. But the association doubted whether such an arrangement would work. 'One of the worries is that in practice many small business would decide it was not worth the candle, since it would so offend their customers that they could suffer more,' Mr Pitman said.</p>

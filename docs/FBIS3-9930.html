			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Major Edith Vargas de Marroquin, Armed Forces  spokesperson, said the Army respects but does not share the  opinion of Human Rights Ombudsman Jorge Mario Garcia Laguardia  regarding the need to repeal Decree Law 19-86, which recognizes  the existence of the Civilian Self-Defense Patrols (PAC).    Vargas reaffirmed that the PAC have spearheaded  counterinsurgency activity in the countryside. In this context,  the existence of the PAC is fully justified, not only for that  reason but also because they provide security for the  inhabitants.    She explained that in areas where there is no guerrilla  threat, the PAC are becoming Peace and Development Committees.  These committees help bring progress to their communities.    Vargas admitted that some patrol members have committed  human  rights violations, as Garcia Laguardia had previously stated.  She said, however, that such cases have been put in the hands  of the law.    The military spokesperson reaffirmed that there is no  obligation to participate in the PAC. She said the document  filed by the human rights ombudsman at the National Congress  requesting the repeal of this decree-law should be examined  under the same light in which the decree itself was originally  issued.</p>

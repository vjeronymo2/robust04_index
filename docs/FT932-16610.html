			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Worse off at the end of the day / A look at the effect on companies and shareholders of Budget changes to ACT One might imagine that a Budget which reduced the tax burden on UK companies would be good news for shareholders. However, the largest blocks of shares are owned by tax-exempt pension funds which have suffered a significant blow from the changes in advance corporation tax. In time, this will adversely affect those companies which have set up pension funds for their employees; for these companies usually promise to make up any shortfall between contributions and the cost of providing pensions promised by the scheme. The extra pensions burden will offset the corporate gain from the easing of the costs imposed by ACT. ACT is a percentage of a company's dividends which is levied as a down-payment on its ultimate 'mainstream' corporation tax. Tax-exempt shareholders, along with pension funds, can reclaim the ACT the company has paid on their dividends. The Budget reduced the rate of ACT from 25 per cent to 20 per cent and trimmed the amount tax-exempt shareholders can reclaim by the same amount. The effect is to cut the value of the total payments received by 6 1/4 per cent. Although there are offsetting benefits for companies, the government's tax take from companies and their shareholders will rise by Pounds 1bn a year. How will these forces affect pension funds? Much depends on exactly how UK companies react to the ACT changes. In the past, companies have raised dividends, to protect shareholders from the impact of the tax changes. Between 1986 and 1988, ACT was reduced to 25 per cent from 30 per cent in line with a general reduction in tax rates. But that reduction, says Mr Andrew Wilson, research partner at consulting actuaries R Watson and Co, was phased in gradually, falling to 29 per cent in 1986, 27 per cent in 1987 and 25 per cent in 1988. More important, UK companies were doing so well that they could afford double-digit increases in their rate of dividend rises. This time, although at least two companies - Rentokil and Unilever - have increased dividends with the specific aim of compensating investors for the tax changes, others are unlikely to follow suit. They cannot afford it. Dividend cover - the ratio of current earnings to dividend expense - is now low by historical standards. Companies usually feel they need earnings of at least two and a half times dividend expense to be able to increase payouts. On average, earnings cover on the FT-Actuaries All-Share Index is only 1.7 times dividend expense. Far from rising, payouts are under pressure. Dividends of the 800 or so companies making up the All-Share shrank  1/2 per cent in 1992 and have shrunk a further 1 percentage point in the first two months of this year. Mr Wilson estimates that it will take companies two years to make up the income lost to pension schemes. The drop in dividend income is of crucial importance to pension schemes, which rely on these earnings to pay contributions. Mr Wilson estimates that a 6 1/4 per cent reduction in pension funds' UK dividend income will reduce it by about Pounds 500m per year. And because actuaries value assets based on dividend stream rather than cash flow, the change will cut some Pounds 10bn to Pounds 12bn off the value of UK pension funds. 'Companies will have to put in higher contributions or cut benefits,' says Mr Wilson. The first employers required to dig into their pockets will be those in declining industries with 'mature' schemes - those with many pensioners and few contributors. Mr Roger Urwin, partner at R Watson, estimates that more than half of all UK pension funds are in the 'mature' category. For more fortunate companies, there will still be an impact in time. Many companies are not currently contributing to their pension funds: the funds are valuable enough not to need topping up. According to the National Association of Pension Funds, the industry trade association, 38 per cent of all British employers made no contribution to their pension scheme last year. The ACT change 'will hasten the day when companies have to begin making contributions again,' Mr Wilson says. 'The big manufacturing companies, the big engineering firms are likely to be hard hit,' said Mr Michael Pomery, partner at consulting actuaries Bacon and Woodrow. Mr Pomery cites the case of a client with a small scheme surplus whose trustees had planned to distribute that surplus as an enhancement to members' benefits. As a result of the tax change, the surplus is gone, Mr Pomery said. Mr Duncan Roberts, pension finance manager at T&amp;N, the engineering company, said the ACT change is likely to knock Pounds 20m off the company's pension scheme surplus when the next actuarial valuation begins this month. The company has made no contributions to the scheme for several years and is unlikely to do so for the moment, but the reduction in surplus will bring forward the time when they must resume. Some pension bosses believe they can cope without too much trouble. Mr Paul Whitney, chief investment officer of CIN Management, the in-house manager of British Coal's pension scheme, says the tax change will cost his scheme Pounds 15m to Pounds 18m of income a year on its Pounds 7bn portfolio of UK shares. While the loss is substantial 'it is not the end of the world', and investment strategies can be shuffled to help make up the income, he said. For example, a fund could make up the lost income by switching into higher-yielding stocks - low-priced stocks with relatively high dividends. However, T&amp;N's Mr Roberts believes such a strategy would expose a scheme to increased risks and reduce its scope to benefit from increases in share prices. Even if pension funds can cope with the immediate loss of income, they fear that the new rules signal an increasingly hostile government attitude to the privileged tax status they have enjoyed. 'I think this is quite a clever move to reduce the tax breaks on pension schemes,' said Mr Trevor Crowter, partner at KPMG Actuarial Services. There are three other indications that the Treasury may have had this in mind. First, Mr Lamont's Budget also included a freeze at Pounds 75,000 on the earnings cap, the maximum salary upon which pensions contributions can be based and still attract tax relief. At the present, this cap affects only high earners and only those who have changed jobs since June 1989. Over time, however, rising wages will push an increasingly high proportion of workers into this category, automatically reducing the tax benefits accorded to pensions. Second, the government is reviewing the entire regulatory regime for pension schemes, through the Goode Committee. It is understood to be examining some aspects of tax policy. And third, some government ministers have started to hint that laws for pension funds have allowed employers to benefit too fully from the tax treatment they are accorded; and that the long-term savings industry would benefit if the same rules applied to all methods of pension provision. So, while the latest changes to pension fund taxation seem modest, the industry is waiting anxiously to discover whether they are the beginning of more radical reforms.</p>

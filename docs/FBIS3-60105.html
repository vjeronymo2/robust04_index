The drugs were seized from an Audi car with Swiss number  plates after the vehicle was forced to stop at a police  roadblock in the southern Italian city, local police said.    Police said they found the heroin, which was valued at 8.2  million dollars, in a plastic bag hidden underneath one of the  rear seats.    The chase began after the car failed to stop at a routine  police checkpoint at an exit off the city's ring road.    The driver of the Audi was arrested. Police identified him  as Istref Salih, 44, adding that they believed him to be a Turk  and a member of an international drug network based in South  America.    Salih was carrying a passport of a central European country  at the time of his arrest, police added.</p>

With the proclamation of the historic law on agrarian reform  in Korea on March 5, 1946, the farmers became the masters of the  land. Korea observes this day as day of agricultural working  people.    The agricultural working people are greeting this day with  successful preparations for farming in spring to bring a bumper  harvest this year, too. They are directing efforts to  increasing the fertility of paddy and non-paddy fields.    According to data available, more compost than planned had  been carried out to the paddy and non-paddy fields of South  Hwanghae Province and other western areas of the country by  March 1.    Carpeting fields with humus soil is in full swing. In the  first two months of this year, 50,000 hectares of fields were  carpeted with humus soil, taking the country as a whole.    Cooperative farms are making substantial preparations for  sowing seed rice on cold-frame beds.    Notably, co-op farms in Sinchon and Anak Counties, South  Hwanghae Province, Pongsan County, North Hwanghae Province, and  Hamju County, South Hamgyong Province, had prepared windbreak  fences, vinyl sheets and other materials for cold-frame beds by  the end of February, earlier than the set time.    The rural communities in the west coast have filled  reservoirs with water and completed the cleaning of waterways  and checkup and repair of pumping facilities.    County farm machine stations and repair bases of cooperative  farms across the country have completed the repair and  readjustment of tractors and trailing farm machines.    And industrial establishments related to the agricultural  sector are supplying farming materials and chemical fertilizers  to cooperative farms in time.</p>

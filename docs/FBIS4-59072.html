			<p>BFN     [Text] Riyadh, May 11 (AFP) -- Northern Yemeni leaders  offered an immediate ceasefire in the civil war on Wednesday if  their southern rivals agreed to accept President 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih's government, a Yemeni envoy said.    Salih and his followers have ousted Vice-President 'Ali  Salim  al- Bid and other prominent southerners from the government  since fighting broke out last week, accusing them of wanting  secession.    Planning Minister 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, an envoy of  Salih,  said that the "political leadership in Sanaa is ready to accept  an immediate ceasefire, on condition that they (the southerners)  respect the constitution."</p>

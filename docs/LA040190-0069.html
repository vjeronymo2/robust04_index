			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 CHALLENGERS FACE BRAUDE IN 1ST DISTRICT  </P> <P> With a trio of challengers eager to dislodge Councilman Evan Anderson Braude  from his seat, the 1st District race is the most competitive of the City  Council contests and the most likely to result in a June runoff.  </P> <P> Braude's three opponents sound common themes while differing dramatically in  style in their quest to represent a district that ranges across glitzy downtown  high-rises, the port area, and crowded slums north of downtown.  </P> <P> Former legislative aide Joy Melton is using homemade lemon loaves and leftover  campaign signs from the last election to promote her attacks on Braude, who she  says has failed to exhibit leadership on a number of critical district issues.  </P> <P> Bill Stovall, a retired deputy police chief with a booming voice and the  backing of the police union, is hoping to ride crime and police issues into  office.  </P> <P> And office manager Paul Croshaw has been walking his way through his first  political campaign, shunning expensive mailers in favor of thank-you notes and  scratch pads describing him as a "neighbor on your side."  </P> <P> Their projected campaign budgets range from Melton's $10,000 to the $50,000  Braude says he anticipates spending.  </P> <P> In his campaign for a second term, Braude, 42, enjoys the endorsement of a  number of organizations, ranging from the community political group, Long Beach  Area Citizens Involved, to the Long Beach teachers' union and the Los Angeles  County Federation of Labor.  </P> <P> Braude, an attorney for Mercury Savings &amp; Loan, is among the most liberal  members of the council, taking a sometimes lonely stand on housing and social  issues considered too bold or far-reaching by most of the council. He has, for  example, favored unsuccessful proposals that would have required landlords to  pay interest on security deposits, forced developers to include low-cost units  in new apartment complexes and required developers of office buildings to  contribute to a housing fund.  </P> <P> His opponents contend that he can't muster votes for his positions, doesn't  deal with constituent problems until they boil over, and hasn't paid adequate  attention to the crime that has swept across his district and every other  corner of the city.  </P> <P> "He hasn't done very much. He's the Rip Van Winkle of the district," asserted  Stovall, a 57-year-old 1st District native whose red, white and blue campaign  headquarters decorations include a banner with a heart declaring love for the  U.S.A.  </P> <P> Stovall says the city's much disparaged yellow street lights should be changed  to brighter ones, and that additional police officers should be paid for out of  the general fund rather than a proposed new property tax levy supported by  Braude.  </P> <P> "When we're murdered at a higher rate than in history, I think safety is the  basic responsibility of this city," said Stovall, who maintains the cost of new  police hires has been exaggerated by city management, although he could not say  what the real cost would be.  </P> <P> Nor could Stovall say what social services he would cut if such budget paring  were necessary to pay for new officers. He described the city's social programs  as inadequate but characterized them as extras. "Those are the nice to have  things," Stovall remarked.  </P> <P> "He has to tell us what cuts he's going to make," countered Braude. "We've done  all the taking (from the budget) we can take."  </P> <P> Appearing ignorant of some of the city's housing policies, Stovall at first  said he was under the impression that the city had adopted or was about to  adopt inclusionary zoning requirements, under which developers would have to  build a certain number of low-cost units in their projects. Informed that the  proposal was actually rejected by the council last year, Stovall at first said  he would oppose inclusionary zoning, then said later in the interview that he  would probably support such a requirement. In general, however, he said: "I  don't believe that there is a shortage of low-cost housing in this city."  </P> <P> Melton charged that Braude "doesn't get out in the community and work with the  people," saying, for example, that he waited too long to help residents  complaining about Fender's International Grand Ballroom, which was eventually  shut down by the city as a public nuisance.  </P> <P> "I don't know of anybody who is in more places trying to deal with more  issues," retorted Braude, saying he met several times with Fender's neighbors.  Nonetheless, he does receive poor marks from the anti-Fender's group. "We felt  he dragged his feet as much as he could," Scott Hunt, one of the group's  leaders, said in an interview.  </P> <P> A medical office worker who worked as a legislative aide for former 1st  District Councilman Marc Wilder, Melton, 46, ran for the seat in 1986 after  Wilder decided not to seek reelection. She came in third and is once again  pursuing the seat with the help of downtown senior citizens and her family. Her  mother makes the small lemon cakes that are carefully wrapped and handed out to  voters.  </P> <P> Croshaw, a 29-year-old office manager for Paine Webber, is president of the  local Junior Chamber of Commerce and president of the Long Beach Area  Democratic Club. He has been walking the district for more than seven months  and says he entered the race because "I wasn't getting phone calls returned  from my local city councilman."  </P> <P> He advocates police foot patrols, the tax levy for more police, inclusionary  zoning and the establishment of a city-run shelter for the homeless. He says  the city needs to make a greater effort to eliminate graffiti and to enforce  housing codes.  </P> <P> "What they're doing is tearing down old slums and putting up new slums and  that's exactly what we have," Croshaw complained, saying the new apartment  buildings he has seen while campaigning are already falling apart.

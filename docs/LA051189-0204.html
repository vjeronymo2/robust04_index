			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> BUSH AIDE ASSAILS SOVIET DISPATCH BLAMING U.S. FOR PANAMA TROUBLES  </P> <P> sident Bush's chief spokesman today criticized the official Soviet press agency  Tass for a dispatch blaming the United States for election disruptions in  Panama. The spokesman said it raised new questions about Soviet intentions on  improving relations with the West.  </P> <P> White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater called the Tass account "very  disappointing."  </P> <P> "It certainly tends to throw cold water on many of the claims of a new  thinking, a new openness in foreign relations," Fitzwater said.  </P> <P> Tass, in a dispatch from Panama City reporting on Wednesday's nullification of  elections in Panama, said the action was necessary because the Panamanian  opposition, "directly instigated by the United States," violated election laws  and tried to rig the results through "subversive actions."  </P> <P> Fitzwater said, "These statements reflect a lack of changes that we all would  do well to keep in mind."  </P></p>

He highly assessed an agreement on the removal of nuclear  weapons from the Ukrainian territory, signed by the three  presidents. Maslin reminded of the fact that talks on this  problem had been going on since 1992 and it was only now that  the talks came to a logical end.    Maslin informed journalists that currently, there are 176  launching installations of intercontinental ballistic missiles  (IBM) in Ukraine, including 130 installations of SS-19 type and  46 of SS- 24 type. There are also around 40 heavy bombers  Tu-160 and Tu-95 capable of launching air-based long-range  cruise missiles. The overall number of warheads stationed in  Ukraine includes 1,300 warheads for IBM and over 600 warheads  for air-based cruise missiles.    In the opinion of the military expert, nuclear safety in  Ukraine causes permanent concern of experts. According to  Maslin. Ammunition depots are overloaded with warheads and  nuclear ammunition removed from combat alert, which resulted in  a considerable increase of the radiation level. This was  confirmed by experts of the Russian nuclear centre  ``Arzamas-15'' who visited Ukraine in September, 1993.    The designed life of the majority of warheads has expired,  while maintenance preventive checks had not been carried out and  some missiles are currently in a critical condition. As an  example, Maslin mentioned three nuclear warheads which had to be  hastily removed from the Ukrainian territory as they were in a  critical condition. It is difficult to say how many hazardous  warheads are in Ukraine yet because there is a lack of experts  exercising control over the safety of nuclear weapons, Maslin  said.    The expert pointed out that any delay in removing and  dismantling nuclear weapons is inadmissible since it is fraught  with unpredictable consequences. However, there are still  people in the republic who either do not realise this or are  deliberately playing out ``the nuclear card,'' he said.    Maslin pointed out that Russian experts can give ukraine  guarantees of safety of all operations in the process of removal  and utilization of strategic weapons.</p>

This  gives Jordan the green light to reopen the branches of its banks  in the occupied territories under joint supervision of the  Central Bank of Jordan and the Palestinian Economic Council.  The two sides have also agreed to use the Jordanian dinar as  the main currency, along with other Arab and international  currencies, and to establish banks for development in the fields  of housing, industry, agriculture, and investment. The two  sides committed themselves to holding meetings, as soon as  possible, of the six joint committees, which have been frozen  for some time.    This agreement was reached following three days of  continuous  meetings, during which journalists heard arguments and  discussion. The Jordanians insisted on obtaining a serious PLO  commitment to coordinating stands in all fields, particularly  the economic field.    The results of these meetings have come as a compromise  solution in light of the PLO's refusal to sign a joint economic  agreement, which has been ready for more than two months. The  two sides have simply committed themselves to the broadlines of  future policies, leaving to the joint committees the task of  drafting the details of agreements in the near future.</p>

			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Elbows out at the starting blocks: The race for the French presidency is heating up now the European elections are over The French presidential election campaign is suddenly under way, even though the final round of voting is 11 months away. Yesterday saw Mr Jacques Chirac, leader of the Gaullist RPR party, publish his campaign manifesto, masquerading as a book under the title of Une Nouvelle France. The French media found this so exciting that yesterday they were out in force to film people buying the book. The race for the Elysee palace always transfixes France's attention. It is the ultimate prize of French politics. It can confer on the winner more relative power - when he also has a parliamentary majority - than a US president can wield, and for a term of seven years that is nearly twice the four-year term allowed under the US constitution. It was always evident that the election for members of the European Parliament on July 12 would mark the effective beginning of the presidential campaign. But until the Socialist party dumped Mr Michel Rocard a week later, it was not clear how dramatic the start would be. On the face of it, the implosion of the Socialist party after its dismal showing in the Euro-election seems to confirm the swing to the right that gave French conservatives 80 per cent of the seats in the 1993 parliamentary elections, and to reinforce the likelihood that the right will take the Elysee next year. But into the Socialist vacuum may eventually be drawn Mr Jacques Delors, the outgoing European Commission president, to carry the party's presidential colours against a possibly divided centre-right. The Socialists' present abject weakness is encouraging among conservatives a similar sort of rivalry to that which helped elect Socialist President Mitterrand in 1981 and 1988. The Euro-election, in which mainstream parties of left and right gained only 40 per cent of the vote, has helped splinter an already fragile party structure. In replacing Mr Rocard as its first secretary with Mr Henri Emmmanuelli, the Socialists have chosen a capable caretaker. With his stated dislike of the party's recent elitism, Mr Emmanuelli will try to recapture some of the working-class support that has poured away to Mr Bernard Tapie. The latter quipped that he and Mr Emmanuelli had in common the fact that they have both been under judicial investigation; Mr Emmanuelli's case concerned allegations of impropriety in party finances when he was party treasurer; Mr Tapie's current problems revolve around his business affairs. But Mr Emmanuelli has openly criticised Mr Tapie's call for youth unemployment to be made illegal as pure demagoguery - a stance that will make a Socialist rapprochement with the Marseille politician no easier. The task of resurrecting the Socialist party will be hard. To distinguish itself from the Communist practice of suppressing dissent, the party invented a system of proportional representation which means that each of its various ideological 'courants' are always present in its executive. Over time, these courants have become warring clans grouped around individual chieftains. Last Sunday Mr Rocard proposed abolishing the system, and was voted down and out; so the system goes on. Nor does France's governing Gaullism, particularly in the generally cautious hands of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, give the Socialists much to kick against. True, they have been able to exploit Mr Balladur's slip-ups when he tried to permit some public financing of private schools and when he tried to reduce the minimum wage for young apprentices. . But the prime minister is, for instance, pursuing privatisation too gently for the Socialists to object plausibly. If Mr Delors could be persuaded to run, he might conceivably prove equal to the Herculean task of keeping a Socialist in the Elysee. According to a CSA institute opinion poll this week, 47 per cent of those questioned said they would have confidence in Mr Delors as president, one point behind Mr Balladur at 48 per cent but well ahead of Mr Chirac at 37 per cent. This is highly encouraging for the Socialists, whose real fear about Mr Rocard was that he might not have made it into the final two-candidate run-off for the presidency. Mr Delors knows his poll standing is a bit illusory, including a 'prime d'eloignement' (a distance premium) that would disappear if he were actually to re-enter French politics and have all of the country's complaints about Europe heaped on him. His candidacy would confront the right with its own divisions over Europe. But it is questionable whether the cerebral Mr Delors could, or would want to, boil 10 years knowledge about European integration down into the simplistic terms of 'what's in it for France?' that a national electorate would demand. However, the greater the chance of Mr Delors staging a 'second coming' to French politics, the shorter the odds on Mr Balladur prevailing over Mr Chirac to be the right's presidential candidate next May. For the prime minister has long portrayed himself as the only leading member of his own Gaullist RPR party who can also carry the centre-right UDF federation with him to beat off any serious left-wing threat. This threat was once posed by Mr Mitterrand, might be by Mr Delors, but patently cannot be by Mr Rocard. Immediately after Mr Chirac and Mr Raymond Barre, the former prime minister, split the conservative vote in 1988, Mr Balladur started campaigning for a single RPR-UDF candidate in 1995. Others took up the idea. By 1991 Mr Chirac and Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, president of the UDF, agreed on a formal 'charter' under which a single candidate would emerge from a series of regional primaries held a week apart and modelled on the American system. This charter is championed nowadays only by Mr Charles Pasqua, the interior minister. It has remained a dead letter perhaps because it is not the French way - and not incidentally in Mr Balladur's Byzantine style - to resolve internal conflict in public. However, Mr Balladur has since pursued the same goal by other means. After the 1993 elections in which the RPR won more seats than the UDF, he named no fewer than 16 UDF ministers and only 13 RPR ministers to his government. The UDF, or key parts of it, has since rewarded him by discreetly giving him their backing for the Elysee. A key part is the Republican party (RP), which accounts for 40 per cent of the UDF's 213 parliamentary seats and is much the largest of the UDF's components. It was perhaps inevitable ideologically that the Republicans would be most susceptible to the wooing of a Gaullist of Mr Balladur's stamp. They represent liberal free-market thinking - always relative in French terms - that is on the right of a federation whose leader, Mr Giscard d'Estaing, has drifted more towards the centre, where the Christian Democrats better reflect his pro-Europeanism. Indeed, within the Republicans there is now an ABG (Anyone But Giscard) element which regards the former president as a patrician has-been. Twenty-seven of them threatened last week to break away from the UDF parliamentary group in order to prevent being coralled into endorsing a UDF presidential candidacy for fear, possibly founded, that Mr Giscard d'Estaing might have another go at the Elysee. They were temporarily dissuaded by the convening of a RP convention this coming weekend to discuss the issue of a single candidacy. The RP's honorary president, Mr Francois Leotard, the defence minister, has indicated that he might run for the presidency, if Mr Giscard d'Estaing does. By the opposite logic, Mr Chirac gives every sign of wanting the UDF to field a candidate because it could not then back Mr Balladur. His RPR loyalists now openly question the need for a single RPR-UDF candidate. These loyalists are led by Mr Alain Juppe, who is the RPR secretary-general as well as foreign minister. Mr Juppe took time off from pressing business on Rwanda to publish in yesterday's Le Monde newspaper a review of Mr Chirac's book, praising the RPR leader's 'energy and contagious enthusiasm'. These are indeed the qualities, coupled with a certain generous lack of calculation, that endear Mr Chirac to the Gaullist machine. He certainly miscalculated with Mr Balladur whom he has regarded more as a sort of sage chamberlain than a top-flight political rival, it was Mr Chirac who wooed Mr Balladur back into politics in the late 1970s, made him finance minister in 1986 and backed him for prime minister last year. It is ironic that Mr Chirac, one of the most experienced of French politicians in terms of offices held, should take so long to learn that in politics favours are rarely returned.</p>

			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Civil service fast-stream entry system reviewed The government is reviewing one of the cornerstones of the British civil service, the fast-stream entry system that assures a glittering career for an elite of young high-flyers. The Cabinet Office said yesterday that the review 'would look at the strategic question of whether the civil service needs a fast-stream system at all'. For nearly 140 years the fast stream has picked out a small group of civil servants at the start of their careers and virtually ensured that they are Whitehall mandarins about 20 years later. The system has been regularly attacked for ensuring that the civil service is run by a like-minded group of white, middle-class males educated at Oxford and Cambridge universities. Mr William Waldegrave, the public service minister, said in a parliamentary written answer that the review would be completed by June. The review follows calls from inside and outside Whitehall for changes to the top structure of the civil service to bring it into line with the management reforms of the past six years. The creation of executive agencies to deliver central government services has led ministers to look for private-sector skills in those who run them. A recent Whitehall report into career management said that the fast-stream system 'could encourage the worst aspects of elitism and, without care, might perpetuate a set of skills more suitable to the past than the future'. Mr John Garrett, Labour MP for Norwich South and a former member of the Commons Treasury and civil service committee, said the announcement was the first time ministers had admitted that the system needed changing. 'A crack has appeared in the facade,' he added. He said that civil service reforms could have a big impact on elite career management in the private sector. Cabinet Office staff were more reserved about the announcement. An official said: 'It shows we are a good, sensible employer, and this is a regular review of whether our recruitment is up to best practice.' The fast-stream system is administered by Recruitment and Assessment Services, on behalf of the Civil Service Commissioners.</p>

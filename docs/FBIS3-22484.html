			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The National AIDS Co-ordination Programme (NACP) has  reported 1,794 new AIDS cases recorded between July and  September this year, bringing the cumulative total of official  figures to 25,332.    The latest number of cases was announced by the Deputy  Minister of Health and Child Welfare, Cde. Tsingirirai Hungwe,  at the launching ceremony of a book on workplace-based  initiatives on combating AIDS in Harare on Monday.    Cde. Hungwe, however, said because of the extensive  under-reporting, the NACP estimated that the real total was  likely to be three times higher, that is, about 70,000 cases.    "But AIDS is the only terminal stage of HIV infection, and  it  is the number of new infections that is of most concern.  Surveillance of ante-natal mothers at a number of clinics around  the country indicates a continuing rise in new infections," she  said.    Cde. Hungwe said at several sites, infection levels of more  than 30 percent had been recorded. More than a third of the  women tested had HIV infection and would almost certainly  progress to AIDS within a few years. In Zimbabwe the incubation  period was estimated at about seven years.    "For every woman reported with HIV, there is likely to be an  infected man. Total AIDS cases in men are slightly higher than  reported cases in women, which may reflect a bias of more men  gaining access to medical treatment and testing," she said.    What made HIV infection and AIDS critical concerns, apart  from the numbers of cases and the rate of increase, was the age  range of those infected and dying. The majority occurred in  adults of working age.    The AIDS epidemic had resulted in demoralisation as  colleagues and workmates became sick and die. Coupled to that  was absenteeism as workers took time off to attend funerals or  nurse sick relatives.    "In the long run, productivity will suffer and companies  will  experience increasing difficulty in coping with labour shortage  and turnover," she said.    The World Health Organisation estimated that there were  around 13 million HIV infections in adults by mid-1993 and about  one million babies had contracted the virus, many of whom had  already died.</p>

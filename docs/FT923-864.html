			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Business Travel Management (2): The aim of a global ring - Computer Reservation Systems COMPUTER RESERVATION systems are helping to change the way that business travel is organised. They are a crucial marketing tool for the airlines which own them and they help travel agents provide more flexible, efficient and global customer services. Increasingly, they also supply the data needed to operate, analyse and oversee corporate travel policies. From their origins in the US in the 1970s, computer reservation systems (CRSs) have evolved into far more than electronic airline timetables. Today a travel agent can call up a customer's 'profile' on a system's central or 'core' computer, check late seat availability on different airlines, arrange a complex itinerary, print out tickets, book hotels and car hire - and do it all from a desktop personal computer plugged into a telephone line. To provide this level of features and sophistication, CRS operators have had to assemble some of the most powerful and expensive non-governmental computer centres in the world. For example, Air France, Iberia Airlines of Spain and Lufthansa German Airlines invested Ecu 450m in start-up costs for Amadeus, the European CRS which began commercial operations at the end of last year. Amadeus itself has spent a further Ecu 400m on buildings, hardware and software. This year Amadeus expects to break even with about 100m bookings, having reached the requisite 'critical subscriber mass'. But even before Amadeus began full operations it lost one of its shareholders when Scandinavian Air Systems decided to pull out. Inevitably, with entry costs on this scale, and the continuing demands of travel agents for expanded global coverage by system operators, there has already been some consolidation among the competing CRSs. Last autumn a planned partnership between Sabre, the world's largest CRS, which is owned by American Airlines, and A m a d e u s fell apart acrimoniously because of last-minute disagreements, described by Amadeus at the time as 'fundamental differences of strategy'. Subsequently two other CRSs, Apollo of the US and UK-based Galileo, announced plans to merge, forming a new Dollars 1.5bn company called Galileo International owned by 11 airlines including BA, United Airlines, KLM, Swissair and Alitalia. Then earlier this month Amadeus, Worldspan, owned by Delta, Northwest and TWA of the US, and Abacus, owned by five Asian airlines, announced a co-operation agreement under which they will interconnect their respective computer reservation systems. (Worldspan and Abacus also have stakes in each other.) 'No system has the capacity or resources to be competitive on every continent,' explains Mr Miguel Vermeheren, Amadeus' director of corporate communications. But travel agencies are increasingly forming international groupings, so CRSs must follow suit. Initially, this technical link will enable travel agencies with branches or affiliations on different continents to share customer records with their partners abroad. Agencies with authorisation will be able to look at a booking record made on any of the three systems, and make out a new booking if necessary. Eventually, travel agents will be able to transfer and change an original customer booking record if, for example, a traveller alters plans while en route. 'The connection  .. is a major breakthrough in Amadeus' strategy to achieve a global ring of computer reservation systems which can fully cover the requirements of travel a g e n c i e s and t r a v e l l e r s worldwide,' says Mr Jose Antonio Tazon, Amadeus' chief executive. 'We believe that the demands of today's travel industry need fuller coverage than is presently provided.' Indeed, business travellers are increasingly demanding one level of travel management across the globe, and using technology is often the only way smaller travel agencies can deliver it. Many travel agents also believe that, even after the recent flurry of mergers and agreements, further consolidation among the CRSs is likely. Mr Don Lunn, chairman of the UK-based Guild of Business Travel Agents' t e c h n i c a l working party, says: 'It has always been my view that ultimately we will see just two global systems, and they will also have to 'talk' to each other.' Indeed, many industry analysts believe the number of CRSs could shrink to two or three as soon as 1995. Like most other travel agents, Mr Lunn would prefer to see some competition maintained between systems, if only to provide some negotiating leverage on charges. Using a PC to access a modern CRS such as Amadeus, which is connected to airlines' own computer systems by high speed data links, provides the business travel agency with other competitive advantages. For example, providing the CRS can provide direct 'real time' access to an airline's internal reservation system it is possible to check late seat availability and make immediately confirmed bookings. But as Mr Malcolm Grubb, technical director for Wagons-Lits Travel, says: 'It also allows us to p r o v i d e a very tailored service to traveller and client.' The travel agency can build up corporate and customer profiles held in the CRS, for example detailing what company policy is on flight class or airline, and whether the traveller is a smoker or requires special meals. By adding in its own management information system software running on the PC travel agents can also capture data from the CRS and then manipulate and analysis it on behalf of a corporate client. In some cases they may be able to use the data to negotiate better deals with airlines or other service providers. CRSs also play an important role in what their airline owners call 'inventory control' or maximising revenues from each seat, a vital ability in the fiercely competitive air fare market. For example, airlines struggle each day to cut prices enough to sell seats on transatlantic flights while keeping them high enough to make money. The dividing line between success and failure is very fine. American Airlines has said that one extra passenger on every flight adds Dollars 114m to revenues and almost that much to profits. Established successful computer reservation systems, such as American's Sabre, can also be an important source of airline revenues in their own right. Sabre takes bookings for 1.6m flights daily and handles 20 times that many inquiries on 740 airlines. Last year Sabre's turnover was about Dollars 550m - more than American Airline's entire cargo operation - in spite of the Gulf War and recession-induced slump in air traffic. The attractions of owning and operating an established CRS have helped make them targets for scrutiny by rivals and by regulators - spurred on by allegations of bias in the way systems display data. Early CRSs in particular were built around an airline's internal computer reservation systems. Not only did these 'hosted' systems list the parent airline's flights first, something which has now been outlawed by the regulators, they also only provided real time or live access to flight information from the parent airline. Information from other competing airlines, although shown on the system, is only as good as the last update. These and other concerns about competition were behind a vote last month in the US House of Representatives which approved legislation aimed at weakening the grip of American and United Airlines over CRS flight bookings in the US. About 70 per cent of US flights are currently booked through the systems owned by the two airlines. The bill, which is opposed by the Bush administration, would make it easier for travel agents to switch to other systems and require that travel agents be able to book, with equal ease, flights on any airline regardless of whose system is being used. Proponents of tougher CRS supervision on both sides of the Atlantic say legislation is necessary to prevent CRS owners from using their control to undermine airline competition. Although all CRS owners are adamant that their own systems have no favourites, their critics are unlikely to go away. The pressures on airlines to dilute ownership through further CRS mergers, or set up their systems as independent companies, are therefore likely to grow.</p>

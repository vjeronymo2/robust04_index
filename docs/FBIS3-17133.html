			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Svetlana Gamova: "Russian Mediators Suggest </F> Kishinev Give Dniester Region Broad Autonomy"]    [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] -- Kishinev and Tiraspol are  prepared to put on the negotiations table counterdrafts of  documents on the future of the Dniester Region. Vladlen Vasev,  the Russian president's official representative, has come to  Moldova with a package of proposals on this question: Russia  will take part in the talks as a mediator.    Although each delegation has its own documents prepared,  they  are in no hurry to make them public. All that is known is that  the CSCE recommendations will be put at the basis of the talks  to determine the political status of Moldavia's [Moldova's]  Eastern regions. Kishinev, according to President Mirchi  Snegur, is prepared to grant the Dniester Region "broad powers"  but people there, at least at the level of official statements,  still agree only to confederation.    Vladlen Vasev, answering an IZVESTIYA correspondent's  question about what specifically the Russian side had brought to  the talks, noted that the content of the documents he had  brought with him comes down to the idea of "broad autonomy" for  the Dniester Region within the framework of a single state.    In the CSCE recommendations one can discern the "Crimean  option" for resolving the Dniester conflict. Kishinev rejects  this option because it fears separatist movements and the  region's withdrawal from the state. Promising to include in the  future law on the status of the Dniester Region guarantees in  the event of the republic's loss of its statehood, official  Kishinev believes that is enough. Actually, the Dniester Region  authorities are also manipulating the people's opinion, citing  the results of a referendum in favor of their own statehood.    Both sides hope to benefit from Russia's mediation. The  Dniester Region is sure that Russia's participation in the talks  is a guarantee that the region's interests will be protected.  Moldavia is counting on using the Russian side's aid to push  Tiraspol toward compromise.</p>

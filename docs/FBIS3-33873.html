			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [passage omitted] We have met with a number of  guests and recorded their reaction to the appointment of Liamine  Zeroual as head of state, on the sidelines of the swearing-in  ceremony. Their reaction was as follows:    [Begin recording] [Unidentified speaker] We are expecting  things to start to happen after this appointment. What is  important today is what the man of the transitional period will  do rather than who is in charge of the transitional period.    [Unidentified correspondent] Kamel Laroussi, you are a  leading member of the Islamic Nahda Movement. What is your  reaction?    [Laroussi] In the name of God, the merciful, the  compassionate. The leader of the movement already answered this  question when he said that the appointment of Liamine Zeroual to  lead the country during this period came about first because he  was a member of the National Liberation Army. However, what we  are hoping will take place during the next phase is that he will  work in accordance with the consensus reached by the parties, in  a bid to bring about national reconciliation. Thank you.    [Correspondent] Ahmed Mahsas is a historic figure and at the  same time he is leader of the Union of Democratic Forces. Mr.  Mahsas, what is your reaction to the appointment of Liamine  Zeroual as head of state?    [Mahsas] Of course we, as a political movement, did not take  part in the dialogue for certain reasons. However, as far as  state issues are concerned our concern is to correct the  foundations of the state. We believe that the appointment of  brother Liamine Zeroual is a positive move in this decisive  period. He has shouldered a colossal responsibility. Such an  appointment may be able to stop the serious deterioration if  measures are taken that will make the Algerian people feel that  something new is taking place. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] Thank you, Mr. Mahsas. Mr. Abdelkader  Merbah, leader of the Majd party, will you give us your reaction  to the appointment of Liamine Zeroual as head of state?    [Merbah] I said in my news conference on 23 December that  there were some signs for a positive change. I was then trying  to hint to Liamine Zeroual as well as other officials of the  state. Thanks be to God, time has shown that I was right. We  are very happy at the appointment of Liamine Zeroual as head of  state because we think he is committed to making a clean break  with the past, and he is a fair and strong man. A strong  Algeria needs strong men to set the house in order. Algerians  were desperate. We hope that our despair is over with the  appointment of men like Zeroual to lead the country.

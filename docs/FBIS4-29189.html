			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- About 250 representatives  of Japanese and foreign automakers and dealers attended a  seminar held in Tokyo Tuesday [14 June] to help promote sales of  cars imported from the United States.    The Japan Automobile Dealers Association, which sponsored  the  session, told those attending that the number of Japanese  dealers selling imported cars has increased because they are not  barred by affiliated makers from selling products of other  manufacturers. The association said the number of such dealers  will continue to increase if imported cars are competitive in  quality and price.    Konen Suzuki, president of Ford Motor Co. (Japan) Ltd., and  other representatives of the Big Three U.S. automakers explained  their marketing strategies in Japan.    The seminar was organized by the association to help promote  Japan-U.S. negotiations for a new framework of bilateral trade.  The association said it plans to hold a similar seminar for  cars imported from Europe.</p>

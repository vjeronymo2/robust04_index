			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / UK Company News: WPP holders urged to support restructuring Mr Jeremy Bullmore, a non-executive director of WPP, the international marketing services group, yesterday called on shareholders to vote in favour of a proposed capital restructuring which has already gained the backing of the group's syndicate of 28 banks. WPP, which has bank debts of Dollars 1bn (Pounds 520m), yesterday held its annual meeting, chaired by Mr Bullmore in the absence, due to illness, of Mr David Ogilvy, chairman. He reminded shareholders that current estimates of first-half pre-tax profits were Pounds 14.2m, 'an improvement on the comparable figures for 1991'.</p>

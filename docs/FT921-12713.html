			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Friend's Provident buys into Milanese brokerage FRIEND'S PROVIDENT, the leading UK life assurer, is taking 20 per cent of a new Milanese stockbroking group in a marked expansion of its Italian interests. It marks the first time a UK insurer has been involved in the establishment of a Societa di Intermediazione Mobiliare (Sim), Italy's new type of broking and fund management hybrid. So far, UK investment in Sims has been limited to Midland Bank. It owns the majority of Euromobiliare, the Milanese merchant bank which last year set up a Sim. Friend's Provident has formed close links with SAI, the Italian insurance group which is taking just under 20 per cent of the new broker. A further 20 per cent will go to Cosmo Commissionaria, the financial intermediary of the Ligresti group. Mr Salvatore Ligresti, the controversial property developer, is the controlling shareholder in SAI. The new broker will be operated by the owners and management of Studio Gamba Azzoni, a Milan broking house. Studio Gamba Azzoni, like a number of brokers, has taken advantage of the Sims law, which will eventually remove stockbrokers' monopoly on share transactions on the bourse, to bring in outside capital. Just over 40 per cent of the shares in the new broker, to be called Gamba Azzoni Sim, will be held by Studio Gamba Azzoni's management. Mr Gian Paolo Gamba and Mr Paolo Azzoni have been appointed managing directors, while Friend's Provident will have two directors on the board. The company will develop fund management activities alongside its broking role. Steps to reform Italy's capital markets received a setback yesterday when the lower house of parliament postponed a debate on a new law regarding takeover bids. The long-awaited legislation, which would guarantee that minority shareholders received fair treatment when controlling stakes changed hands, is one of the few remaining planks in Italy's financial deregulation. In spite of widespread political support for the measure, opponents in parliament argued that more discussion was required in view of its ramifications for the economy. It is now likely that debate will be put off until after general elections likely to be held in early April.</p>

			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FROM L.A. PARENT: A WORD OR TWO ON TEENS;  </P> <P> PUBLICATIONS: THE EDITOR OF LOS ANGELES' POPULAR PARENTING GUIDE OFFERS A  MONTHLY NEWSPAPER WITH TIPS ON 'URBAN SURVIVAL' FOR KIDS.  </P> <P> These last 10 years as founding editor in chief of L.A. Parent might have been  preparation enough for just about any new publishing venture Jack Bierman chose  to undertake. But then, Bierman and his staff decided this year to launch the  Noise, a colorful monthly newspaper geared toward local teen-agers, and found  themselves confronted with a whole new set of constantly changing rules and  customs.  </P> <P> The paper addresses the often confounding mix of teen-age seriousness and  frivolity with a lively collection of feature articles on entertainment,  education, emerging sports heroes, fashion and social issues. They admit that  it's been a difficult task appealing to a wildly scattered and deeply factioned  age group that has some members more interested in rap than surfing, others  preferring sports to sunbathing, or movies to fashion, and vice versa. And even  if it's true that as many things stay the same as change with teen-agers, it's  not always easy to tell which those are.  </P> <P> "We are just now at the point where I think we're starting to get a feel for  what kinds of things they're interested in," said Bierman, 47, sitting in a  conference room with Noise editor Norbert Sparrow, both surrounded by stacks of  L.A. Parent and Noise back issues. "That's one of the fun things about starting  a publication. You have this period of experimentation. Then the publication  actually starts speaking to you, defining itself."  </P> <P> Subtitled "An urban survival guide for teens," the tabloid-sized Noise is  distributed free throughout Los Angeles at record and clothing stores, sandwich  shops, bowling alleys and some high schools, with a circulation that Bierman  says is about 45,000. Its seventh issue hit the streets this month.  </P> <P> A similar publication aimed specifically at students attending private schools  exists in New York City, but Bierman and Sparrow agreed there are few other  long-term success stories with teen newspapers across the country. Even if  entertainment listings on the back pages of the Noise would seem a valuable  guide for young adults looking for nighttime activities similar to those  enjoyed by their older brothers and sisters, the Noise and other would-be teen  papers suffer some inherent problems.  </P> <P> "As far as teen-agers are concerned, as a group we're so self-conscious that if  we pick up something labeled for us, immediately it's uncool," said 16-year-old  Jackie Goldberg, a senior at the Buckley School in Sherman Oaks who has  contributed entertainment reviews to the Noise. "That's just a fact of life.  </P> <P> "But the Noise is good because it focuses in on what it knows is going on with  teeny-bops."  </P> <P> Some of those topics stretch far beyond the fascination with celebrities and  enter into real problems now faced by young people. One recent issue recounted  the pressures faced by a young mixed-race couple. Other articles, by  professional writers, have dealt with AIDS, skinhead youths and a variety of  pressing educational matters.  </P> <P> "It may seem like they have it easier than we did superficially," Sparrow, 36,  said. "I don't think they have it any easier. They have to deal with very  important problems: AIDS, the will to succeed, coming out of college with a  $40,000 debt."  </P> <P> Indeed, the seriousness of contemporary teen-agers caught the Noise founders by  surprise when they visited high school campuses to survey students and teachers  about their concerns and needs. Most surprising, and gratifying, to them was  the discovery that a large number of teen-agers are avid readers, absorbing  publications as light as Bop magazine and as heavy as the Economist.  </P> <P> Teen-agers as a group are heavy consumers, while surprisingly issue-oriented,  Bierman said. Advertisers of movies, television and clothing have already  attempted to reach that group through the Noise. And Bierman said he hopes  colleges and insurance companies will soon purchase space for the same reason.  </P> <P> The editor is also waiting to see what new products and services may emerge  partly in response to the Noise, much as the local parenting industry that  virtually sprung up around the untapped readership of L.A. Parent. When that  localized parenting magazine was founded in 1979, Bierman said, it was the only  one of its kind in the country. Since then, 60 have started publication.  </P> <P> "You have to be around a while before people are going to sink their money,"  Bierman said. "So that's the challenge. I'd like to say it's interesting, but  since some of this money is mine, it's more than interesting."  </P> <P> Bierman said starting up the Noise added "around 25%" to the annual costs of  L.A. Parent, owned by Bierman and his younger brother, publisher Carey Bierman.  The new expenses center around its new, larger printing bill, the addition of  more office space and salaries.  </P> <P> Sparrow said he has five teen-age writers contributing entertainment reviews to  the paper. Most of them came in response to an advertisement in the Noise  seeking young writers and photographers.  </P> <P> Jackie Goldberg had heard about the new publication from a friend during the  summer and soon picked up a copy at a local clothing store. Her main interest  then was in art and graphics, and she sent a letter to the Noise with some  examples of her artwork. Sparrow called her back to say that the paper uses its  professional staff for its MTV-inspired design, but invited her to write for  the paper.  </P> <P> "It's pretty exciting," she said. "People at my school, when they hear, they're  impressed. But what I like about it is that it's a job I went and got for  myself without anyone's help."  </P> <P> The Noise still relies on its staff to create the longer, in-depth feature  stories that are the paper's foundation. So the teen-age journalists are left  to the reviews and news briefs inside and are paid a nominal fee of $15 for  each story.  </P> <P> "But that's not the point," said Kevin Taylor, who at 17 was the Noise's first  teen-age writer. "I do it for the experience and because I love to write."  </P> <P> It has also allowed the senior from Monroe High School in Sepulveda the  opportunity to attend concerts and film screenings for the press, squeezing in  between the same professional critics he's read or seen on television.  </P> <P> "It's a great ego trip."  </P> <P> Goldberg hasn't yet decided whether to focus her upcoming college education on  art or study English literature as a way to continue with her new interest in  journalism. Before the Noise, she had never seriously considered writing as a  career. "This makes it more real," she said.  </P> <P> The Noise editors are now looking for young correspondents from every high  school in the city, in an attempt to stay current with teen-age concerns. And  as a result, the occasional teen-ager, whether in plain blue jeans or in  post-punk, platinum-haired glory, has wandered into the otherwise quiet L.A.  Parent-Noise offices. Bierman still seems a bit incredulous at some of the  things he's seen and heard.  </P> <P> " 'Don't boge my mode,' " he said, smiling. "Have you heard that?"  </P> <P> Sparrow laughed. "Once we've heard about it, it's probably already passe."  </P></p>

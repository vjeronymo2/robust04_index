			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Cadbury gives cause for applause - The Bottom Line ANY chairman of a company with British Aerospace's problems needs all the good news he can get. So, when Sir Graham Day slipped this week into another of his many roles, as chairman of Cadbury Schweppes, he could be forgiven for making a meal of its impressive full-year results. These, he said, marked 'a record year in every respect.' In spite of sluggish 2.7 per cent sales growth, pre-tax profits raced ahead by 13.2 per cent to Pounds 316.4m, bettering the most optimistic forecasts. Earnings rose 9.6 per cent to 27.73p a share while gearing fell 49 per cent to 39 per cent. Cadbury's classy performance marks a further pay-off for its strategy of focusing tightly on core businesses, applying firm cost controls, and ploughing heavy investments into improving manufacturing efficiency and marketing support. This is just the kind of proven formula the City likes in food companies nowadays, and it has helped Cadbury's shares out-perform the sector by 12 cent in the past year - although they eased slightly after the results. Can Cadbury continue to justify its premium rating? Analysts think there is plenty of scope for further growth and expect pre-tax profits of about Pounds 345m this year. The latest results underline the star role of the soft drinks business, which increased operating profits by 12.5 per cent. Acquisitions have expanded Cadbury's international presence greatly in recent years, and Les Pugh of Salomon Brothers reckons the division can look forward to annual profit gains of 16 per cent. In the US, the company defied a weak soft drinks market last year to increase volumes faster than any of its rivals. Although only a small player by the standards of Coca-Cola and Pepsi, Cadbury claims to be benefiting from a demographic shift in favour of 'adult' soft drinks. In Britain, where Cadbury's beverage operations are handled by a joint venture with Coca-Cola, a drop in leisure drinking cut sales volumes by nine per cent. Yet, operating results still rose 17.8 per cent, thanks to success in pushing through price increases. The real engine of growth is likely to be continental Europe, where soft drinks' consumption is only one-third the level in the US. Volumes are expected to increase strongly in the next few years, propelled by heavyweight marketing campaigns by Coke and Pepsi. Cadbury lacks a cola but it is well placed to cash-in on overall market growth. A series of deals has enabled the company to build a bottling network second only to Coke and add local brands, such as Gini and Oasis in France, which it is extending beyond their home markets. By comparison, the company's confectionery operations offer a less exciting prospect. Although they did well to increase market share and profits in a recession-bound British market last year, their overall trading results advanced only 4.4 per cent, slightly less than their growth in sales. Longer term, Cadbury faces a dilemma. Already, it leads its home market, where its rock-solid position is rooted in Britons' liking for milky chocolate. But this preference is shared hardly anywhere else except Australia. As a consequence,international sales expansion faces a 'taste barrier'. Cadbury's efforts to overcome it by acquiring continental companies with local brands, notably Poulain in France, have not been wildly successful. Furthermore, the highly-concentrated structure of Europe's chocolate industry means there is little else available to buy - although opportunities may remain in the more fragmented sugar confectionery business. So, where can Cadbury turn for growth? One option would be to forge an alliance of the kind the company has already with Coke in beverages. The obvious candidate is Jacobs Suchard of Switzerland, the only big European chocolate-maker without a strong UK presence. Philip Morris, Suchard's well-heeled US owner, has of course long topped the list of predators rumoured to be stalking Cadbury. The British company is now thoroughly inured to questions on this point, and Day went out of his way last week to emphasise that it would not be easy meat. He said Cadbury was determined to make itself as expensive as possible by maintaining a high price-earnings ratio. 'Any potential acquirer is going to have to have deep pockets,' he declared. adding that fiercely-independent companies always tended to cost bidders more. Just how much of Cadbury's share price is due to a bid premium is debatable. Most analysts believe its present level has more to do with the 'flight to quality' which has occurred as the market has grown wary of the recession's impact on lesser food stocks. Either way, Cadbury's management has a powerful incentive to keep on running hard.</p>

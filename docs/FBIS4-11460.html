			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Buenos Aires, 25 Apr (NA) -- Defense Minister  Oscar Camilion tonight denied rumors regarding his resignation.  He also denied that he would comment on the murder of conscript  Omar Carrasco, arguing that "clairvoyance is not my business, I  manage a ministry."    During the Adad &amp; Longobardi television program, the  minister  compared today's rumors regarding his resignation with "last  week's reports which assured that President (Carlos) Menem had  undergone an operation."    Camilion stressed that the rumors regarding his resignation  "are far from true," adding that "maybe they are being floated  by some internal faction" unknown to him. [passage omitted]    Answering a question on a possible deterioration of the  image  of the Armed Forces and civilian disobedience against compulsory  military service, Camilion said: "If something like that  happens, it would be due to a compounding of many involved  factors."    "If a deterioration of the Armed Forces image is encouraged,  then those who encourage it are active participants or, of  course, it would not be spontaneous," he emphasized.    The minister compared this topic "to political factors and  campaigns," like what happened "during the recent march in  Neuquen Province, when the slogans were clearly political."

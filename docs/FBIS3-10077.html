			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Global TV News" newscast] </F>   [Text] The state-run news agency ANDINA has suspended  services indefinitely due to a lack of liquid funds. The ANDINA  board of directors issued a communique announcing that overdue  accounts have kept the agency from having the necessary liquid  funds to maintain operations. ANDINA was financed through the  sale of advertising space to state enterprises. One of the  agency's main debtors is SUNAT [National Superintendency of Tax  Administration], which owes ANDINA more than 1 million new soles.    ANDINA Information Manager Francisco Perleche said that  until  the liquidity problem is resolved, employees will continue doing  internal work.</p>

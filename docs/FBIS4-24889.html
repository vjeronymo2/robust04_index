			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Willy Wo-Lap Lam] </F>   [Text] Chinese police have detained six underground church  activists in the run-up to tomorrow's fifth anniversary of the  June 4 crackdown. They have also ordered hotels in Beijing to  turn off the international television network CNN at least until  next Monday.    Sources in the dissident community said yesterday that while  they did not anticipate large-scale actions, protests by  individual dissidents and workers could erupt this week.    Beijing resident Hua Huiqi said yesterday he and five other  Christians had been taken into custody while they were  worshipping together. Mr Hua said he was held from Monday to  Wednesday. He said police returned to his flat yesterday to  detain him again, but he was not home.    "This is a problem of belief, we haven't broken the law," he  said in a telephone interview.    Mr Hua said Wang Huamin, Gao Feng, Wu Rengang, Xu Honghai  and  Gou Qinghui were detained last weekend. All but Gao, thought to  be a 26-year-old car worker, are known to have been released, he  said.    Mrs Gou is the wife of Xiao Biguang, a former Beijing  University teacher and active Christian who was taken into  custody on April 12. Mrs Gou was detained last Friday and  interrogated for eight hours before being released after she  started suffering heart problems, Mr Hua said.    Mr Xiao, 32, is a friend of Yuan Hongbing, a Beijing  University law professor who was arrested in March. Yuan was a  founder of the outlawed Federation for the Protection of  Workers' Rights.    Police are believed to be hunting other affiliates of the  federation, which organised a petition to the legislature  calling for the freedom to form independent unions.    Sources in the dissident community said the authorities were  concerned about the "political activism" of one branch of the  underground church, which they suspected of having links with  the nascent labour union movement.    It is understood that another group of Beijing-based church  activists tried to start a demonstration earlier this year.    "The rally was aimed at demanding not only religious freedom  but general political and civil rights," a source said. "It was  stopped by police in time, and the organisers have been put  under surveillance since then."    The dissident sources said that while police had banished  Wang Dan and other big-name dissidents from the capital,  individuals, including disgruntled workers, could stage protests  in Beijing and other cities in the run-up to the anniversary.  Security sources said that today and tomorrow parts of  Tiananmen Square would be cordoned off from the public.    They said police were on guard against individuals or small  groups staging protest actions, such as distributing  pro-democracy leaflets and other literature calling for a  reversal of the official verdict on the 1989 student movement.    Meanwhile hoteliers said major hotels in Beijing yesterday  received a fax from the local Public Security Bureau asking them  to switch off CNN, which is received by satellite.    "We were told by relevant authorities the cut-off is due to  repairs to a hitch in the signal -- the service will be  interrupted for up to a week," one hotel technician said.    CNN's suspension took effect just before the U.S.-based  network aired a report on the growing potential for labour  unrest in China.    Analysts said the ban on CNN was probably to keep file shots  of the 1989 crackdown from being beamed into China during the  anniversary period.</p>

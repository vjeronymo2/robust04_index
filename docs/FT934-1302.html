			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Arts: Looking for laurels - Architecture By October this year, 11 cities in the UK had applied to be considered as City of Architecture and Design for 1999, under the Arts Council's Arts 2000 initiative. Each year cities are invited to make bids to the council to host a year-long celebration of a particular art form. The shortlist for 1999 has now been announced: it is Edinburgh, Glasgow and Liverpool. Other bids came from Cambridge, Greenwich and London Docklands. The awards are more than just hype. In 1992, Birmingham was a successful City of Music. Next year, the East Midlands will be Region of Dance, which does not have quite such a ring about it. In 1995, Swansea will be City of Literature and, believe it or not, there is to be a year of Photography and the Electronic Image in 1998 and a year of 'rice-planting and the florescent image' to celebrate the millennium. We will not know which city has won the architectural nomination until a series of day-long visits and a fair amount of junketing has taken place to win the hearts and minds of the selection panel. The judges have been chosen largely from the Jurassic Park of architecture: Lord St John of Fawsley; Professor Colin St John Wilson; Sir Terence Conran; the president of the Royal Institute of British Architects, and one or two others. There is the wise addition of two people too busy to be on the full-time panel but who will visit the cities and help make the final choice. They are Simon Jenkins, former editor of The Times, and Bernard Rocher, deputy mayor of Paris. A lot of arts money is spent on these thematic years and the winning city will receive Pounds 400,000. The Arts Council describes 1999 thus: 'The focus of the year will be excellence in the promotion of public appreciation of architecture and design, including landscape and civil engineering design. Proposals may include initiatives which aim to promote good design for the public.' In theory this is a good idea to encourage public awareness of architecture, although the worrying thing is that it seems to be tied up with the Arts Council's obsession with 'architecture centres': it cannot be a coincidence that the three shortlisted cities have promised to build such centres. These cities should be warned by the fiasco that surrounds the proposal to build a literature centre in Swansea to an amazing design by Alsopp and Lyall, leading architects of the avant-garde. The proposal sadly appears to have bitten the dust. Put not your trust in arts councils. Architecture centres have only a limited use because the real resource is the city itself. Books, tours, films and videos are available, but best of all are a good pair of shoes and a guide so that you can walk and look. I do not recall Alec Clifton-Taylor or Sir John Betjeman or Sir Osbert Lancaster ever mentioning the phrase architecture centre - and they opened more eyes to architecture than any arts bureaucracy can ever hope to do. Glasgow has certainly discovered the value of promotional skills and is already adopting a hard-sell approach. Its bid is based on the theme 'The City as a Living Artwork', which sounds ominous. One of its ideas that will appeal to restaurateur Terence Conran is a design cafe where designers from Tokyo, Barcelona and Milan will be linked via computer and video for discussions over the polenta. I wonder whether designers eat more daintily than other mortals. We shall see. Designer haggis is rather a frightening thought. In its eternal wisdom the Arts Council has decided, according to its spokeswoman, to promote civil war in Scotland by pitting Glasgow's amazing talent against the dazzling genius of Edinburgh. Edinburgh plans to base its 1999 International Arts Festival on the theme of architecture and design and to rely on the excellence of its present urban development programme. Liverpool is wisely being a little more circumspect because its should, by any standards, be the winning city. First of all, Liverpool's artistic and architectural heritage is second to none and is not sufficiently known. It has great architecture of all periods, from Georgian to the 20th century. It is also a city that needs as much outside help and support as it can muster, because of its relatively sudden decline and because it is recovering from a bad attack of political madness. It has some of the best buildings in the UK from its days as the third-largest city, and it has arguably the greatest seaport in the country. When I recently took an American visitor there, he thought he had arrived in Athens when he walked out of Lime Street Station. Sterling work has been done to preserve the city's best architecture and to build some good new buildings. Liverpool is by far the most deserving candidate to be City of Architecture and Design and trendy Glasgow and staid Edinburgh should look to their thistles because the competition will be tough indeed.</p>

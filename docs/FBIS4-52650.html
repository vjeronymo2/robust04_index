			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 12 (KCNA) -- Kim In-so's eldest  daughter Kim Hwa-sim and Ham Se-hwan's elder sister Ham Suk-nyo  sent letters to the national Red Cross organisations of  different countries, calling for their active cooperation in the  repatriation of Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan who are now detained  in South Korea after being forced to a long prison life for  refusing ideological conversion.    In the letters they earnestly asked the national Red Cross  organisations that defend human rights and value Red Cross  humanitarianism to pay attention to the miserable lot of their  families and launch an active international campaign for an  early repatriation of Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan.    Kim Hwa-sim said:    "I feel my heart rending when I think of my father who spent  more than 30 years in prison and is suffering in a land away  from home, not allowed to return home in his declining years.    "The South Korean Red Cross unreasonably refuses to send  back  my father. This is a very wrong behavior ignoring international  law and Red Cross humanitarianism.    "My father's repatriation is not only his wish but also the  unanimous demand of the entire fellow countrymen and human  conscience."    Ham Suk-nyo said: "It is two years since I heard that my  brother whom I had thought dead during the Korean war was alive,  but my ardent wish to see him in my lifetime has not yet been  realised."    She called on the national Red Cross organisations to deeply  understand the anxious wish of an octogenarian to see her  younger brother whom she had raised on her back.</p>

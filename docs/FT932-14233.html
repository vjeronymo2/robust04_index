			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Leading Article: AT&amp;T vs BT THE PROSPECT of American Telephone and Telegraph and British Telecommunications invading each other's turfs - brought nearer by the US company's application for a UK licence last week and a similar application by BT in the US last month - will cheer telephone users on both sides of the Atlantic. The traditional cartel structure for handling international traffic has served customers ill. While it would be naive to hope for a head-on collision between the two giants, more competition should bring substantial benefits. The most obvious would be cheaper transatlantic call charges, currently two to three times cost. Customers could also benefit from a wider range of services, such as international freephone dialling and from dealing with the same operator on both sides of the ocean. The consumer interest in greater competition has long been clear - in fact, there have been desultory talks between the US and UK governments for two years aimed at opening markets. What has changed is that BT and AT&amp;T now realise that competition is in their interests too. In the past, they believed that their interest lay in excluding each other from their markets. Now they judge there is a greater advantage in a reciprocal opening. This is partly because they have found the market for international calls is highly 'elastic' - cutting prices stimulates greater phone usage, perhaps even to the extent of compensating for the cut in margins. Moreover, both AT&amp;T and BT have an interest in building traffic bases in overseas markets so they are well positioned to become leading players in an increasingly liberalised global market. A similar consideration applies to the UK economy as a whole. Cheaper and better handled calls between the UK and the US would reinforce Britain's position as Europe's largest telecommunications hub, on which it could further capitalise when markets in the rest of the continent are opened. While the giants' conversion to liberalisation is welcome, a beneficial outcome is by no means assured. Although they would now prefer mutual opening of markets to mutual exclusion, the ideal outcome for each would be the maximum opening of the other's market and the maximum protection at home. In fact, BT and AT&amp;T have lost no time in listing restrictions which exist in the other's market and in insisting that these be removed before their home markets are opened. Details obviously matter, but there is a danger of negotiations between the governments becoming bogged down in minutiae. What is needed is for both governments to inject urgency into the talks. In doing so, they will need to keep sight of the big picture and be prepared to override some of the detailed demands of their phone companies. They must ensure that the best does not become the enemy of the good.</p>

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Past crises haunt last lap of Salinas term: Mexico's president gambles on Nafta to beat current account deficit THE prospect of a financial or political crisis haunts the last leg of Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's six-year term. After all, the last three presidential terms ended disastrously with steep devaluations, debt defaults or street protests against electoral fraud. While an outright political or economic crisis such as those of previous years seems unlikely, many are already predicting an awkward and difficult time before elections in September next year. Observers point to the instability associated with the transition from one all-powerful president to another. With the president exercising such power, rumours and speculation over the succession can easily rattle financial markets and make powerful interest groups tremble at the prospect of policy shifts. Perhaps above all, analysts worry about the huge gamble the president has taken in betting so much on the North American Free Trade Agreement. Were it to be rejected by the US Congress in the vote scheduled for later this year, investors might be unwilling to finance Mexico's huge current account deficit, possibly provoking a devaluation. The pro-US, so-called technocrat wing of the ruling party would also suffer a setback, while the nationalist wing, and hitherto divided and weak opposition parties would receive a boost. The government is arguing things are different this time. 'The vicious circle of debt, budget deficits and inflation has been broken,' says Guillermo Ortiz, under-secretary of finance. With debt down to a manageable 28 per cent of gross domestic product from 62 per cent in 1988, public finances in surplus, and inflation nearly at single digits, the economy is less vulnerable to sudden shocks, he argues. Officials deny the rejection of Nafta would lead to any significant reversal in policy - although it might make the political situation more unstable. On the contrary, says one government minister, Nafta would put pressure on the government to push ahead with more economic reforms as a way of reassuring financial markets that the country's economic strategy had not changed. Were Nafta delayed, or called off, the question of the succession would loom even larger than in the past, as Mexicans and foreigners alike speculate over the likely reaction in Mexico to the US rejection of the treaty. The concern is particularly acute because traditionally Mexican presidents lose some control over the political process as in-fighting over the succession rises, and attention begins to shift to the next presidential term. While far from his being a lame duck, there are nonetheless some signs that President Salinas is losing his once steady political touch. In February the president was forced to back down on a scheme to solicit Dollars 25m from the country's 30 wealthiest businessmen for the ruling PRI party in the face of intense domestic and international criticism of business's generous donations. 'Three years ago Mr Salinas would have got away with raising such large sums,' says Mr Federico Estevez, a professor of political science at the Instituto del Tecnologia Autonomia de Mexico, 'but now his control is slipping.' More recently the government has had to back down on a plan to postpone elections for governor in the opposition stronghold of Yucatan, after vehement local and national protests. The government's vulnerability is heightened by the delicate state of the economy. It has been forced to let interest rates rise to 8 per cent in real terms and run a budget surplus to slow import growth and try to counter a current account deficit expected to be Dollars 25bn this year. This is expected to cut economic growth to 2 per cent this year from 2.6 per cent last. The Salinas administration is keen to encourage growth to accelerate by the time of the elections next year. It is thus banking heavily that Nafta will attract to Mexico more direct foreign investment, and thus allow lower interest rates and more government spending without endangering the exchange rate. But while the anxiousness of the government is palpable, a serious crisis in the economy or sudden reversal in policy still seem improbable. Mr Miguel Basanez, head of the polling organisation Mori of Mexico, and often a critic of the government, puts the odds of a political or economic crisis at no more than 10 per cent. 'Things are still under control, the president is popular, and the economic team and policy is better than in the past,' he says. The Mexican government has fought hard for macro-economic stability, and the consensus is that President Salinas will not throw everything away in a fit of pique at the US. Mr Pedro Aspe, Mexico's finance minister, says: 'Fiscal and monetary policy has been exactly the same in 1989, '90, '91, '92, '93 and it will be exactly the same in 1994. We do not use stop-go (policies).' The government also has more than Dollars 20bn in foreign reserves as a cushion against sudden outflows of capital. Similarly, the succession itself is not likely to throw up any surprises. All the favoured candidates from within the ruling party worked under Mr Salinas in the budget ministry in the mid-1980s, share broadly his economic vision and studied economics or public administration at US universities. Even Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the head of the leftist Party of Democratic Revolution, and who as an independent candidate came close to beating Mr Salinas in the disputed presidential election of 1988, says were he elected president he would not take Mexico back to its protectionist, inward-looking past.</p>

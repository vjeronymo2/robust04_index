			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Stefano Marroni report: "The Christian Democrats' Fall"] </F>   [Text] Rome -- In the beginning was the breakup of the PCI  [Italian Communist Party], split by the collapse of the Berlin  Bettino [Craxi] and torn apart by the corruption investigations.  Now, on a bright morning in January 1994, the time has come for  the DC [Christian Democratic Party] -- the last of Italy's major  parties -- to acknowledge that it can no longer remain united.  In other words, that the miracle is over for the Great White  Whale, too.    By one of the paradoxes of history, it fell to the mild  Martinazzoli, the Hamlet-like Mino, to certify the death of the  miracle, to certify that as of today, while some people remain  in, others are out. In other words, to say that only he and his  supporters are heirs to the DC, and that Mastella, Casini,  D'Onofrio, and the rest are already "another party." It is up  to him to guarantee that from now on those we have hitherto  called Christian Democrats will each stand on their own side --  albeit involved right away in already familiar struggles over  the name, symbol, and assets of the DC.    The dramatic event that [DC founder] De Gasperi's heirs have  tried desperately to avert for months suddenly took place in a  little more than a minute. That is, as long as it took Mino  Martinazzoli to emerge from DC headquarters and to enter the  Brescia-registered BMW belonging to his trusted friend, Domenico  Berterici. He was intercepted by three agency reporters: "So,  Mr. Martinazzoli, are you still angry with the centrists, after  yesterday's meetings with Maroni, [Radical leader] Pannella, and  the nondenominational parties?" He turned round with an  expression of surprise and averred that he was not angry: "It  seems clear to me," he said deliberately, "that the  neo-centrists have taken their leave. And I acknowledge the  fact." There ensued an icy silence appropriate to such an  important occasion. Martinazzoli went on: "This is not simply  my opinion: When they behave like a party, with their own  government program and their own strategy and when they hold  talks with other political interlocutors, I acknowledge the  fact. I do so calmly." And he calmly went on: "I only know  that they are another party. Apart from that, if they want to  talk about the succession to the DC, I am willing...."    That was all there was to it. Martinazzoli, the last  secretary of the DC, closed the car door and left. But it was  not long before the "little" that he did say became news. And  when it did become news it immediately elicited a torrent of  responses from a party that has now realized that it has reached  the end of the road. Martinazzoli was immediately granted  support by those with whom the secretary met yesterday morning  -- Franco Marini, Pierluigi Castagnetti, and Rosa Russo  Jervolino, even though when she arrived at DC headquarters she  called Pierferdinando Casini to attempt a final mediation, in  order to organize a meeting at the end of the week. Then there  were Forleo, De Rosa, and the "40." Not to mention Rosy Bindi,  of course, who remarked "splendid!" to welcome this "act of  great openness," as she put it, whereby Martinazzoli "is  confronting the so-called neocentrists with their  responsibilities."    Those who followed the approaching storm with bated breath,  and who, now that it has broken, are in danger of being  overwhelmed or swept away by it, are saying nothing for the  present. Mariotto Segni is saying nothing, having based his  swing to the center in the summer on the axis with Martinazzoli,  but who now, with him alone and with Bindi and Mattarella --  having already initiated accords with the League and perhaps  Berlusconi -- can no longer build his Grand Center. And there  is an anxious silence, too, from the soft underbelly of the DC  -- the great DC in the South that hates Mastella but does not  trust Martinazzoli. And that trembles with fear when it sounds  out its voters. For De Mita, Mancino, and Gargani, any path  will be a difficult one to take....    On the other side, however, it will take very little to  prompt Casini and Mastella to resume busy discussions about what  is to be done. In Bologna, Rome, and Ceppaloni rapid progress  is being made by the idea of turning the final days under the  common roof of the DC into days of battle. Francesco D'Onofrio  issued an immediate response. He admitted right away that  Tuesday's tour of the seven moderate churches [reference to  traditional Easter pilgrimage to Rome's seven most important  churches -- scathingly, a wild-goose chase] was "a deliberately  provocative initiative, barely legitimate, designed to achieve a  political clarification." He said "Martinazzoli should have  conducted these meetings." He harped on the issue on which he  knows the secretary to be weak, demanding an immediate National  Council session to establish "who is in the majority and who in  the minority."    The major attacks on the DC came soon after that. The first  was a document signed by Casini, Mastella, D'Onofrio, Fontana,  and Fumagalli-Carulli -- that is, the "splittists." It had the  flavor of a challenge being taken up. We too are "calm," the  five announced. We too "acknowledge" that the discussion of a  program with other forces "is becoming for the secretary the  demonstration of our desire to form another party." Gorrieri  did not receive such firm treatment, they told the secretary  sarcastically, "but we are not surprised," because what the DC  leadership "clearly cannot accept is our idea of creating a  moderate electoral cartel alternative to Occhetto's." Let us  convene the National Council, they concluded, and see whether  the conditions exist for us to cover some ground together or, as  Martinazzoli says, in order to establish the details with regard  to the succession to the DC."    These are the outlines of an unprecedented political  challenge -- a door left open to the hope that a spectacular  internal upheaval could bring the largest sector of the DC to  occupy the place within the moderate alignment that "we," as  they put it, "have in any case already firmly occupied." Their  sights are set mainly on Formigoni and Buttiglione, the  neo-centrists. That is, on two former CL [Communion and  Liberation] members who have never severed relations with the  League, who have never attacked Berlusconi, and who, together  with Bianco, are attempting a mediation, simultaneously  condemning the "error" and "imprudence" of Mastella and his  friends, and Bindi's haste to break away. They are siding,  albeit cautiously, in favor of a National Council session before  the "constituent" assembly on 18 January at which the People's  Party will be established.    But this is a very slight hope, little more than a move  demanded by political protocol. The rest, the real essence of  the conflict, came in the second attack, in the letter already  making its way to Martinazzoli's desk, without too much  publicity. It is a lengthy document in which 35 National  Council members warn that they are prepared, on the basis of  party statutes, to convene the Council themselves in order to  discuss "considerations concerning the continuation or cessation  of the DC, and the consequences." It carries a postscript that  constitutes an outright challenge: There must be no changes  meanwhile to the "name, symbol, and assets of the party." This  because otherwise the DC's final moments would be lived out in  still less exalted surroundings -- not only at DC headquarters  but also in attorney's offices and gloomy courtrooms....</p>

			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Former British charity worker admitts smuggling ammunition to besieged Moslem forces A former British charity worker in Bosnia has admitted smuggling ammunition to besieged Moslem forces, it was reported yesterday. He and another aid worker had earlier been reported missing and were now under house arrest by Moslem fighters in the town of Travnik, BBC television said. The pair were sacked by the British children's aid organisation Feed the Children in June after the group said they had become emotionally involved in the conflict and endangered the neutral status of the charity.</p>

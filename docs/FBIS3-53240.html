			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tehran, Jan. 12, IRNA -- The English daily TEHRAN  TIMES in its editorial Wednesday [12 January] said the terrorist  Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization (MKO) was behind the last Sunday  attack on the British Embassy in Tehran as it would benefit from  Iran's strained diplomatic relations with Western Europe.    Referring to the previous attack on the French Embassy and  the Air France office in Tehran on November 9, the paper said,  "undoubtedly the two instances of attacks on the foreign  embassies in Tehran, involving in both cases European countries,  are related to one another and are in fact links in a chain of  premediated plots which are carried out with specific  objectives."    It stressed that such acts of terrorism are meant "to damage  the international prestige of the Islamic Republic."    "In the past few months the Islamic Republic had undertaken  active diplomatic initiatives to resolve its problems with some  of the European countries and it had attained great progress in  this direction.    "In the majority of cases the diplomatic initiatives taken  by  the Islamic Republic have been successful, and a broad range of  understandings had been achieved. The most concrete sign of the  improvement of relations between Iran and the Western Europe is  the release of the two Iranian citizens by the French  Government," said the article.    It further added, "consequently it is quite logical to  conclude that the attacks on the embassies are meant to  undermine Iran's recent improved relations with the Western  European countries.    "Terrorist acts including attacks on embassies have always  been condemned by the Islamic Republic as irrational endeavors  which defeat their own purpose."    The editorial in conclusion called for taking concrete  measures to forestall any attempt which aims to sabotage Iran's  diplomatic achievements and for tightening security measures  around embassy compounds.</p>

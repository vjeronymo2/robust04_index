			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAYOR BRADLEY'S PROPOSAL FOR MANDATORY WATER RATIONING  </P> <P> Hey, lots of us don't want to take shorter showers! It's time for Mayor Bradley  and members of the City Council to get more anti-growth. I don't see our city  officials calling on our federal officials like Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Los  Angeles) and company to do something about curbing population growth in already  crowded Southern California.  </P> <P> Instead of remaining passive to the issue of controlling our borders against  illegal immigration and passing more laws increasing legal immigration as well,  our members of Congress should be fighting for vastly increased family-planning  assistance to the teeming and disadvantaged peoples of the Third World.  </P> <P> HARVEY PEARSON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

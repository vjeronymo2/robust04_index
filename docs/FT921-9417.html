			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets: Foreign capital flows into Brazil on inflation hopes - For the second consecutive month this emerging market is the best performer Optimism about inflation and hopes that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) would approve a Dollars 2.1bn standby facility made Brazil the best performing emerging market in January for the second month in a row, according to indices published by the International Finance Corporation (IFC), part of the World Bank. Brazil rose 37.6 per cent in dollar terms last month, compared with a 44.9 per cent advance in December. Ms Else Derrick, head analyst for Latin America at London-based investment managers Latin American Securities, says that no less than Dollars 122m of foreign capital flowed into the Brazilian stock market in the first few days of January and that average daily turnover topped Dollars 100m during the whole month. According to the dollar-adjusted Bovespa index, the market came off the month's high on profit-taking on the news that the IMF had signed the proposal for Brazil. By January 28, the day of the IMF approval, the local index had climbed 64 per cent; but it closed the month with a 47.8 per cent gain. Ms Derrick says the market has been losing ground in February, and that average daily volume has halved to around Dollars 50m. However, the outlook for the market is still favourable. Equities have been supported by President Fernando Collor de Mello's recent decision to appoint three members of the liberal PSL party as his ministers, thus strengthening his power base in congress. Furthermore, the government's tight monetary policy and forecasts of a good harvest this year make it plausible that inflation will be in single figures by the end of the year, compared with an estimated 25 per cent in January. However, Ms Derrick believes that the government's forecast of 2 per cent inflation in its letter of intent to the IMF is too optimistic. Investors are also hoping for good news from this month's negotiations with the Paris club grouping of creditor governments. The worst performer was Pakistan, which fell by 13.4 per cent in dollar terms, partly eroding December's 30.4 per cent record-breaking advance. Karachi fell steadily last month on news of unrest in the southern province of Sind, and continues to weaken. Rumours of a build-up of troops on the border last week interrupted India's recent rise to new peaks. According to the IFC, India rose by 20.6 per cent in January in dollar terms. The only other faller on the month was Portugal, down 6.8 per cent in spite of the government's attempts to make the market more attractive.</p>

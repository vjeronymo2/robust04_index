			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, Feb 10 (CTK) -- After a meeting between  Slovak representatives and a group of senior officials of the  French cabinet today, Slovak Deputy Prime Minister Jozef Prokes  expressed himself for creating such security guarantees in  Europe which would prevent possible destabilization in case of a  crisis situation.    At the meeting, the aides of French Prime Minister Edouard  Balladur, currently visiting Slovakia, discussed the questions  of European stability and the preparation of a conference on the  issue to be held in Paris at the end of May, said Bernard de  Monteferrand, Balladur's diplomatic adviser, and Thierry Dan,  the adviser for strategic affairs.    Prokes said that "the opening of Western European markets  will be the best aid for Slovakia," adding that European  stability and the economic situation were interlinked.    Prokes also praised creating the basis of stability at the  bilateral level. However, he said, it would not be suitable to  draft different models for Western European countries and for  Central European states, as originally suggested in the Balladur  Plan.    Solution to ethnic minorities' status within the Balladur  Plan cannot take into account the present situation alone,  regardless of historical developments. "If the first is done,  those countries could get advantage, which have got rid of their  ethnic minorities," Prokes stressed.    He said the French guests admitted that first it was  necessary to recongnise the principle of unalterability of  borders, and only then to solve ethnic minority problems.    The Balladur Plan, now a joint initiative of the European  Union, was conceived as a "preventative security" system  directed toward countries having difficulty re-orienting  themselves in postcommunist Europe. It is based on the ideas of  the unalterability of state borders and individual rights for  members of national minorities.    As discussed by Slovak hosts and French guests on Wednesday,  applying the plan involves inviting to a May 26-27 conference in  Paris those states which are considered front-runners for  European Union membership. This means in particular the members  of the Visegrad Group -- the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary,  and Poland.</p>

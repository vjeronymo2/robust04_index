			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: UK equities Some semblance of calm returned to the equity market yesterday. It is too early to know whether the spasms emanating from the bond markets have passed. Gilts recovered yesterday too, but they were more picking up ground lost to other European markets on Thursday rather than staging a genuine rally. If the more tranquil mood continues next week, it will be interesting to see what happens to this week's wilder fears about interest rates. So negative was the market's mood that it was bound to take badly to the suggestion from the chancellor's panel of advisers that the next move in interest rates could be up. Yet none of the advisers are calling for rate rises now and two want cuts. Having regained their poise, equities could revert to a sunnier view of rates. That could produce a rally, but it would not necessarily be durable. There is an air of lost innocence about interest-rate expectations now that the Federal Reserve has tightened. The chancellor's panel expects UK rates to rise next year when, incidentally, taxes will increase yet again. A falling savings rate may then no longer support consumer demand and the fundamentals will look less propitious. The real selling has yet to begin. It may take time, but it will come.</p>

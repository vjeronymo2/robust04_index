			<p>BFN     [Text] Albinas Januska, Lithuanian deputy minister of  foreign affairs, today summoned Nikolay Obertyshev, Russian  ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary in Lithuania, to  the Lithuanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The view of the  Lithuanian Government on the decree of Russian President Boris  Yeltsin was explained to the ambassador. He was told that such  unilateral actions by Russia are unacceptable to Lithuania.    The attention of the ambassador was drawn during the meeting  to the fact that the Russian stand, disseminated by the Russian  diplomatic missions, attempting to disclaim the annexation of  the Baltic states in 1940, has no historical or legal  foundations. Such a stand is contrary to the Lithuanian-Russian  agreement of 29 July 1991 on the foundations of interstate  relations, where Russia acknowledged that in 1940 the USSR  annexed Lithuania.    In discussing the return of the Lithuanian Embassy building  in Paris, Albinas Januska expressed his concern that Russia has  so far failed to solve this issue.</p>

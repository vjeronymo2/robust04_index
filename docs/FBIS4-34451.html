			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 17 Jun (NA) -- Economy Ministry  sources said today that the Economy Ministry will not respond to  the Brazilian Foreign Ministry's abrupt decision to suspend  Domingo Cavallo's trip scheduled for the end of June. The  suspension is presumably due to Brazilian annoyance over  Argentina's support for Mexican President Carlos Salinas de  Gortari to preside over the GATT general directorate.    The unexpected situation surprised the Economy Ministry, but  the economic team decided not to comment until the situation  clears up because there are still some conflicting reports on  the issue.    The abrupt cancellation of Cavallo's visit to Brasilia was  understood as a reprisal because Argentina gave its support to  Salinas de Gortari instead of supporting Brazilian Economy  Minister Rubens Ricupero from Rio de Janeiro to preside over the  GATT directorate.    Argentina's support for the Mexican president was made  public  by President Carlos Menem during the Ibero-American summit this  week.    The Brazilian press today published the remarks of several  diplomats saying that the Brazilian Government felt  "disappointed" at Menem's position, taking into account that  Argentina is Brazil's partner in Mercosur [Common Market of the  South] and it knew Brazil had proposed Ricupero for the post.    The diplomats also were annoyed because Brazil's seat was  empty when Menem made the announcement. At the time, the  Brazilian delegation was accompanying President Itamar Franco,  who was mourning the sudden death of his nephew and private  secretary.    The Brazilian Foreign Ministry lowered the tone after the  dust raised by the affair settled and justified the suspension  of Cavallo's visit by saying it was due to an "incompatibility  in the agenda."</p>

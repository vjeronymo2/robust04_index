			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Don't you just love being in control: Richard Giordano's move to British Gas Mr Richard Giordano's decision to become chairman of British Gas on January 1 suggests that the 59-year-old American, who was at one time Britain's most highly paid executive, is not about to have his career placed on the back burner. His appointment to succeed Mr Robert Evans, the present chairman, will be as a non-executive. But British Gas have made it clear that the position will be his 'main job'. It carries with it a salary of Pounds 450,000, compared with the Pounds 380,000 paid to Mr Evans, but there will be no bonus or share options. Mr Giordano said yesterday that he wanted British Gas to 'focus on adding value for the 2m loyal shareholders and institutions' - a sentiment welcomed in the City, where analysts know him well as the former chairman and chief executive of BOC, the industrial gases group. One observer said the appointment marked British Gas's evolution, with 'senior management becoming more worldly'. Few expressed fears that his non-executive status would mean a limited commitment to the job. Most said that, based on past performance, it would be out of character for Mr Giordano to take a back seat. The former lawyer joined BOC in the late 1970s when it took over the US company Airco, of which he was president. He remains on BOC's board and other non-executive directorships include RTZ, Lucas, Reuters and Grand Metropolitan, where he will remain deputy chairman - the other posts are up for review. The presence of a strong commercial figure at the top of British Gas should help to remove analysts' concerns that the senior management and board of directors is top heavy with insiders. Such a situation, they say, sat uncomfortably with British Gas's strategy of diversifying away from its heavily regulated business in the UK into competitive international markets. With Mr Giordano's appointment, two of the top three positions will be occupied by executives with outside experience. Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive, has worked his way through the British Gas hierarchy. But Mr Philip Rogerson, finance director, joined British Gas from ICI last year. The task which faces the trio is not altogether clear, however, aside from the obvious fact noted by Mr Giordano that the company is 'entering a period of great change'. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, is expected to decide shortly on whether to implement a Monopolies and Mergers Commission recommendation that British Gas be broken up into separate trading and pipeline companies. He must also decide whether to end its monopoly in the residential market. Given that the government decision could be handed down as early as this month Mr Giordano's task will be not so much to influence the government's thinking on the industry as to make commercial sense of whatever official policy emerges. Aside from adding an international gloss to British Gas, Mr Giordano will bring to bear specific skills and experience gained at BOC. Analysts point to similarities between BOC's market position in the 1980s and British Gas's current predicament. Both enjoyed a near monopoly position in a quasi-commodity domestic business. And both have chosen a strategy of international diversification with an emphasis on adding value. An area in which Mr Giordano is likely to make an early impact is British Gas's expansion into undeveloped international markets. BOC had strong links with Asia, an area which British Gas has also targeted, both for its exploration and production possibilities as as well as for opportunities to provide gas for power generation schemes and industrial use. Mr Giordano is also likely to have a substantial effect on a corporate culture which critics say is still steeped in the company's public sector roots. Many of Mr Giordano's boardroom colleagues are the product of a regional power structure which some analysts say has given rise to quasi-autonomous empires. 'There could be a lot of friction between him and what is still in some ways a sleepy and bureaucratic company,' said one. The pace at which power becomes concentrated at British Gas's Thameside headquarters in London may be one of the best ways of assessing Mr Giordano's progress, according to one industry expert. Company officials stress, however, that internal opinion, from Mr Brown downwards, is solidly behind the choice of Mr Giordano. 'It's good to have a real heavyweight who wants to make the company more profitable,' said one official. His appointment has reduced some of the uncertainty surrounding the business, but whatever the value added by Mr Giordano, it is still the UK government which is firmly in control of British Gas's destiny.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [INTERFAX report: "Prosecutor's Office To Check Legality of </F> Opposition Leaders' Speeches"]    [Text] The Russian General Prosecutor's Office has  instructed Moscow Prosecutor Gennadiy Ponomarev to investigate  illegal actions which took place in the capital 9 May 1994  during a rally in Lubyanka Square.    INTERFAX was told at the General Prosecutor's Office that G.  Ponomarev has been instructed to carry out an investigation and  make the appropriate legal assessment of the case of the public  burning of the Russian Federation state flag, of the calls from  the rally speakers for a struggle to "destroy the existing  regime," of the abusive attacks on top state officials, and of  the anti-Semitic slogans and banners.    The rally in Lubyanka Square was organized by a number of  opposition parties and movements. In particular, it was  addressed by former Russian Vice President Aleksandr Rutskoy and  National Salvation Front leader Ilya Konstantinov, who both  spent around six months in jail on the charge of organizing the  mass riots in Moscow 3-4 October 1993. In his speech Rutskoy  called for the 50th anniversary of the victory over fascism in  1995 to be marked by a "victory over this antipeople regime."    A statement from the General Prosecutor's Office notes that  the Prosecutor's Office is attentively following the development  of the situation and warning that "full use will be made of the  powers granted it under the law to put a stop to  unconstitutional actions by both individuals and associations of  citizens aimed at destabilizing the situation in society."</p>

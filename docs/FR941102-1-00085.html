			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The corresponding somatic cell adjustments for average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> producers under the four orders in addition to Chicago are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Upper Midwest, zero cents; Iowa, minus one cent; Nebraska-Western  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Iowa, minus six cents; and Eastern South Dakota, minus three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cents. The formula results in an estimated range of forty-eight  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cents per hundredweight from a somatic cell count of 1,000 to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> somatic cell count of 750,000, or a positive twenty-two cents to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a minus twenty-six cents, although there is no limit on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deduction that may be made since there is no limit on the maximum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SCC in this decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The use of a neutral point was supported by various  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proponents of a somatic cell adjuster. Several others suggested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a neutral range. The record contains numerous references to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neutral range or point around a somatic cell count of 400,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One witness expressed the opinion that the base level for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> somatic cell adjustment should be near the average for the five  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> markets. Another witness explained that their proposal used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 400,000 SCC because that is where their present quality program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> begins. Based on data included in the hearing record, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average SCC for producers whose milk is pooled under the five  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> orders is 367,000. Therefore, a neutral point of 350,000 is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate. It is close to the average for the markets, and not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantially different from the values that witnesses found  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate. Also, by using the formula included herein,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proponents of both a neutral point or a neutral range are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accommodated because the formula yields no value adjustment for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately plus or minus 7,000 SCC around 350,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The formula will give producers an incentive to reduce their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SCCs while minimizing the effect of the somatic cell adjuster on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those products in which somatic cells have a quality effect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rather than a yield effect. The argument that a somatic cell  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjuster will negate the forward pricing of Class I and Class II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> milk is also minimized by the proposed formula. Analysis shows  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the month-to-month variation in the somatic cell adjustment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at a particular somatic cell level is no more than one cent per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hundredweight, with an approximate change of 1 cent for every  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increment of 15,000 somatic cells. This small variation from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> month to month should allow handlers to determine accurately the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost of milk for forward pricing. In fact, the variation in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> somatic cell adjustment is significantly less than the month-to- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> month variation in the current butterfat differential, which is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not known until after the end of the month.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since this decision applies an adjustment for somatic cells  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to all milk, there is no need to include the somatic cell  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment in the computation of the producer price differential. There are only two reasons to include somatic cells in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> producer price differential computation: (1) To exclude a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular class or classes of milk from being affected by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> somatic cell adjustment, or (2) to redistribute the somatic cell  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment money among all of the producers in the market. Since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this decision applies the somatic cell adjustment to all milk the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first reason is not relevant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There may be some merit for redistributing money from high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> somatic cell producers to low somatic cell producers marketwide.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, if such a provision were adopted, the producer price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> differential would also be affected with changes in the market  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average SCC. In fact, as the market average SCC decreased, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> producer price differential would decline below the level of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> producer price differential in the absence of a somatic cell  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> count adjustment, decreasing the incentive for producers to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduce the somatic cell counts of their milk and defeating the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> objective of a somatic cell count adjustment. Therefore the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> somatic cell adjustment will be applied to all producer milk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without being included in the pool or producer price differential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> computation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

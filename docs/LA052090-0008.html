How true!" when we read "It's in  the Male."  </P> <P> One could pursue further the author's husband's statement, "A man's ego is  quite large. But it's very delicate." I am thinking of writing a book titled  "Fathers, Husbands and Sons: Walking on Eggshells in Three Generations."  </P> <P> JACKIE WILLIAMS, Huntington Beach  </P></p>

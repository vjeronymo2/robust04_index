This  follows the highly professional visit of Deputy Prime Minister  Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim to Jakarta recently. A record 12  memoranda of understanding were signed between both governments  and respective private sectors."    The high-level business trip was intended to set up a joint  venture company called Malindo. The joint venture will help  identify small- and medium-scale industries in Indonesia. The  venture is meaningful because it will promote closer ties  between the private sector in the two countries.    "The partnership is all the more timely and vital in view of  ASEAN's goal to form a single market early next century.  Malaysia's trade and investment linkages will help the two  countries to become growth centers within ASEAN."    Of course, as in any business venture, problems are bound to  crop up. The challenge is to overcome these problems and work  for mutual benefit. There will be many rewards, including for  the two countries' markets. There are differences in the  business relationship between the two countries, but more  importantly there are great similarities. It is encouraging to  see that a memorandum of understanding was signed to market the  Proton in Indonesia. This is the national car's first entry  into the protected Indonesian market. Indonesia should become  involved in Malaysia's national car project by supplying auto  components for the project. An Indonesian group and the  manufacturer of the national car are already discussing this  possibility. Two-way cooperation has also been extended to the  financial sector.    "Malaysia has promised technical assistance in establishing  Islamic financial and insurance system. There is much Malaysia  can contribute in this area, as it has one of the most  successful Islamic banking system in the world."    "It is also all important in a world that is increasingly  becoming more competitive, and where developing countries seem  to be always pushed around."</p>

			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / International Company News: Nokia cuts its forestry links NOKIA, the Finnish electronics group, is selling all its shares in Jamont, Europe's second-largest paper tissue company, in a deal worth at least FM550m (Dollars 108m). The disposal means the group is severing its last ties with forestry, the industry on which it was founded 127 years ago. The buyers of the 13.4 per cent stake are James River, the US paper group, and Italian investment company Cragnotti &amp; Partners. They will gain full control of Jamont as they own 86.6 per cent of its shares through Jamont Holdings. Nokia says the sale will release a profit of some FM200 to FM300m for investment in its core mobile telecommunications and electrical activities. The final price will depend on Jamont's 1992 profits and currency factors at the year-end. The immediate trigger for the sale was the expiry of an option agreement at the end of this year, although Nokia had signalled its desire to leave the paper business some time ago. Under the original joint venture agreement of 1989, when Jamont was set up by Nokia, James River and Italy's Ferruzzi, the Finnish group's paper activities essentially became a portfolio investment. A year later, it sold a 50 per cent stake in Jamont-Nokia, one of the two companies established under the joint venture, and was left with a holding of just 13.4 per cent in Jamont. That sale was concluded for FM559m. Jamont, with expected 1992 sales of Ecu1.2bn (Dollars 1.5bn), has some 14 per cent of the European tissue market, trailing Scott of the US with 18 per cent. Nokia also said its Nokia Cables and Machinery subsidiary was setting up a joint stock company near Tallinn in Estonia with Harju KEK. Nokia will upgrade Harju Elekter's cable-making lines to enhance the Estonian group's export possibilities.</p>

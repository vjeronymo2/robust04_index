			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Europa Press report: "Barcelona Hospital Denies That </F> Yeltsin Has Cirrhosis"]    [Text] Barcelona -- Barcelona Hospital medical director  Carles Humet has stated that he has no evidence that Russian  President Boris Yeltsin is suffering from cirrhosis of the  liver, and added that although he will be coming to Barcelona on  his coming official visit to Spain, he does not intend to  undergo a medical checkup at that hospital.    Boris Yeltsin was twice treated for back pain by a medical  team from that hospital -- first at the Barcelona Hospital and  later in Moscow. Dr. Humet stated that he does not deem it  necessary for Yeltsin to be given a medical checkup in  Barcelona, "since the doctors treating him in Moscow are  sufficiently competent." Humet added that "we know that he is  coming to Barcelona, but there are no plans for him to have a  medical checkup. He has not requested this, and we do not  believe that it is necessary. Moreover, it makes no sense to  plan a visit so far in advance." The doctor stressed: "We have  been denying this (the checkup) for days. Now is not the time  to start speculating whether or not he will come."    The Barcelona Hospital medical director added that Boris  Yeltsin has asked to see personally some of the doctors who  treated him, but not for medical reasons -- just out of  friendship.    With respect to the reports published about the possibility  that Yeltsin is suffering from cirrhosis of the liver, Humet  said that "we have no evidence that he has cirrhosis. At least,  the last time we visited him (in September 1993), he did not  have cirrhosis."    Humet added that if Boris Yeltsin had any problem with his  back or liver, "he would not wish to be treated in Barcelona,  because greater publicity would be given to the matter here, and  everybody would know about it. Moreover, he can be treated in  Moscow with the same guarantees."    The first time that Boris Yeltsin was treated at the  Barcelona Hospital was around three years ago, during a visit by  the Russian president to Barcelona. Yeltsin felt unwell, and  was taken to that hospital, where he underwent an operation for  a slipped disk. The second occasion was in Moscow at the  beginning of September 1993, when Yeltsin again felt discomfort  and pain in the lumbar region, and was treated by the same  medical team, which went to the Russian capital, although this  time an operation was not necessary.    In addition, the Russian Consulate in Barcelona has neither  confirmed nor denied the possibility that Boris Yeltsin will  undergo a medical checkup in Barcelona.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow March 3 TASS -- Unless the warring factions  are not flatly opposed to Russia's participation in overseeing  the delivery of international humanitarian aid to the Tuzla  Airport, Russia will take part alongside other states, according  to Yuriy Vorobyev, Russian first deputy minister for civil  defence and emergencies.    In today's interview with TASS after a meeting with Miles  dick, first secretary of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, Vorobyev  said "the Ministry for Emergencies is ready to send its  representatives to the Balkans and to get down to work already  tomorrow".    A group of Russian representatives is expected to consist of  about 50 emergency and customs officials, TASS learned from  well- informed sources. However, before humanitarian supplies  can be delivered to Tuzla, it is necessary to make necessary  arrangements at the airport, including repair of the runway. At  the moment, the airport is not ready for accepting planes. With  this in view, two ministry officials have left for Belgrade and  Zagreb to do firsthand assessment of the situation and to agree  with the U.N. mission a date when the proposed operation could  be launched, as well as the scope of resources required for it.  It is quite possible that a Russian plane loaded with  international humanitarian supplies will be one of the first to  land at the Tuzla Airport. Some 23 tons of babyfood have been  already prepared for shipping to the Balkans.    The U.S. diplomat described the opening of the Tuzla Airport  as one of the most pressing tasks, since this is to provide  those affected by the armed conflict with humanitarian aid. The  embassy secretary highly praised the activities of the Russian  Emergencies Ministry's units in former Yugoslavia. "They really  know their job", he noted.    At present, two transport units numbering 90 officials of  the  Russian Ministry for Emergencies are operating in former  Yugoslavia, who ensure the delivery of U.N. humanitarian  supplies from Belgrade to regions of bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the General Committee of the General </F> People's Congress; place and date not given--recorded]    [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the  compassionate. In light of the atmosphere of hope and optimism  which has begun to prevail in the country, the General Committee  of the General People's Congress [GPC] would like to extend its  warmest congratulations to the lofty Yemeni masses on the  occasion of the signing, in heroic Aden today, of a document of  pledge and accord to build a modern Yemeni state by parties to  the Political Forces Dialogue.    The GPC considers this step a crowning of the sincere  national efforts to put a decisive end to the political crisis  and its regrettable repercussions, which have negatively  reflected on the lives of the citizens and harmed the homeland's  interests and stability.    Hence, the GPC's General Committee welcomes the positive  results that have been achieved and stresses its adherence to  the contents of the Document of Pledge and Accord. It, along  with all the forces of goodwill in the country, hopes that this  approved national step will be the beginning of a translation  and achievement of all the aspirations of our people. These  aspirations include maintaining the unity of the homeland and  reinforcing the pluralistic democratic experiment; building the  modern Yemeni state--the state of law and order--as well as the  constitutional institutions founded on justice, democracy, and  respect for human rights; entrenching the bases of local  government which are based on administrative and financial  decentralization; seeking to alleviate the suffering of the  citizens and securing their daily life requirements; and  achieving a cultural awakening in modern Yemen.    Moreover, the GPC also expresses its deep appreciation for  the Political Forces Dialogue Committee for its extensive  efforts and the formidable difficulties it faced to achieve this  document, which is an obligating pledge or (?contract) for  everyone. It is a document that should be adhered to and put  into practice by everyone to shoulder his responsibility to  achieve what is contained in this document as far as  implementation mechanisms and timetables are concerned.    The GPC continues to be loyal to Yemen and its people and is  concerned about unity, democracy, and national accord. It has  been guided by wisdom and patience in order to remove all the  dangers and challenges facing this homeland. Moreover,  throughout the crisis, the GPC's stands have been marked by  national responsibility, good sense, and self-restraint. It  strongly refused to be drawn into the perils of escalation which  harms the homeland and its unity, the democratic formula, and  the citizens' interests. Hence, the GPC announces that it will  not hesitate to exert every effort and join hands with all those  who are concerned about Yemen--the Yemen of unity and  democracy--in order to triumph for the issues of the homeland  and the people, to practically implement all agreements, and to  move our homeland toward a better and prosperous future in  fulfillment of all our people's aspirations and ambitions of  progress, growth, and prosperity under the banner of unity,  democracy, and peace.    Issued by the GPC's General Committee.</p>

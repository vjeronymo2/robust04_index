			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REPORT OF NEW TAKEOVER PLAN LIFTS UAL STOCK  </P> <P> Shares of UAL Corp. closed higher Tuesday following a published report that  United Airlines management has crafted a tentative, employee-led leveraged  buyout bid valued at up to $240 a share, or about $5.4 billion.  </P> <P> UAL rose $2.75 to finish at $176.25 a share on the New York Stock Exchange. A  UAL spokeswoman declined to comment on the report or the stock move.  </P> <P> However, takeover stock traders said they doubted whether any proposal for the  Chicago-based airline company will be completed in time for consideration  during a board meeting today.  </P> <P> Traders said UAL rose on a report in the Chicago Tribune that cited  unidentified sources as saying United's management has come up with a buyout  proposal worth up to $240 a share.  </P> <P> UAL's management has been struggling to craft a new buyout for the airline's  parent since a planned bid of $300 a share, or $6.75 billion, led by UAL  management and pilots fell apart in October after the group failed to secure  financing.  </P> <P> The Chicago-based company is under pressure to shape a new bid because Coniston  Partners, a New York investment firm, has threatened to take control of UAL's  board and push through a restructuring or other deal to boost its stock price.  </P> <P> The newspaper said there is speculation that the new buyout proposal might  entail an offer in which each UAL share would be exchanged for up to $200 in  cash and securities with a face value of about $40 a share.  </P> <P> Under the plan, UAL employees would own about two-thirds of the company and  public shareholders about one-third after a buyout, the newspaper said.  </P> <P> It also said that under the plan, management would invest $30 million for a 2%  stake in the airline company and would be granted options for another 6%.  </P> <P> The chief difficulties in wrapping up a deal reportedly have been enlisting the  support of United's machinists and flight attendants unions and persuading  banks to finance a transaction.  </P></p>

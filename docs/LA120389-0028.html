			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RICHARD ALATORRE  </P> <P> As a Latino woman, I found your article on Richard Alatorre to be impressive  and inspiring for Latinos. So often society stereotypes minorities as  uneducated immigrants, unsuccessful and with little or no ambition for  themselves or their community. Alatorre has proved them wrong. He has had his  share of personal problems, which he has not allowed to constrain his climb up  the political ladder. If anything, they have made him sensitive to the needs of  the community and his constituency.  </P> <P> As a member of a minority, I ask myself, "What have I gained and learned from  this individual?" My answer: Work hard, work smart, and share my talents with  others, for in the long run, we all gain from them.  </P> <P> CYNTHIA ALATORRE  </P> <P> (no relation to Richard)  </P> <P> Playa del Rey  </P></p>

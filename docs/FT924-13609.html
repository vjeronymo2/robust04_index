			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / International Company News: General Electric reports third-quarter advance GENERAL Electric, the diversified US holding company, yesterday reported a 6.5 per cent increase in third-quarter net income, with strong growth in businesses such as financial services and aerospace outweighing lower profits in white goods and power systems and losses at its NBC broadcasting subsidiary. The group reported net earnings of Dollars 1.11bn, or Dollars 1.30, a share, compared with Dollars 1.04bn, or Dollars 1.20 a share, in the third quarter of last year. Revenues rose from Dollars 14.6bn to Dollars 15.5bn. Mr Jack Welch, chairman, said GE's productivity growth had continued at an annual rate of about 5 per cent and he was confident of another year of record earnings. However, the operating margin declined from 9.6 per cent a year ago to 9.1 per cent. This was more than accounted for by two unusual factors - higher restructuring charges and the 1992 Olympic Games, which NBC lost money covering. The figures included a gain from a realignment of the equity positions of GE and Ericsson in their mobile communications venture, which was more than offset by restructuring charges. GE's financial services businesses produced net earnings up by 17 per cent. GE Capital saw double-digit earnings growth, led by commercial equipment financing and private label credit cards. Kidder Peabody, its securities house, achieved 'sharply improved 1992 results'. Aerospace had a 'good increase' in operating profit on somewhat higher revenues, mainly because of sales timing, product mix and productivity gains. For the nine months, GE made Dollars 3.38bn, up from Dollars 3.17bn, before the effects of a one-time accounting change taken in the first quarter.</p>

			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Military aids push on Rio crime The Brazilian federal government and the state government of Rio de Janeiro agreed yesterday on a military-led crackdown on drug gangs, arms trafficking, police corruption and crime in the city. President Itamar Franco and Rio governor Nilo Batista agreed on creation of a unified crime-fighting organ with the military directing united operations of the state-controlled military and civil police, justice secretariat and civil defence secretariat. The army will supply the police with the same heavy weapons used by drug gangs. The federal government has been under media pressure to intervene in the city's shanty towns, many controlled by heavily-armed drug dealers, after violence including the deaths of at least 13 people by stray bullets in October.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Speaker of the Russian State Duma, Ivan Rybkin, met  Monday speaker of the Azeri parliament, Rasul Guliyev.    A spokesman for the State Duma quoted Guliyev as saying that  the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia cannot be solved  without Russia's involvement. For his part, Rybkin said that  even though Russia was criticized by many for "taking too much  upon itself" in terms of settling ethnic conflicts, its efforts  are "sincere and will be continued".    Guliyev stated with regret that Russia was gradually losing  its influence in Azerbaijan, and Azerbaijan in Russia. This  cannot be permitted, he said, since close economic contacts  between Moscow and Baku will do more for strengthening the  Russian influence in the East than "the use of force".    Under discussion was also the problem of drawing closer the  Russian and Azeri legislations, first of all, in the sphere of  customs.</p>

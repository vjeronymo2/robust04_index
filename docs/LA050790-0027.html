Kienzle is accusing  ABC-TV and 20th Century Fox of stealing an idea for a sitcom based on life in a  Roman Catholic rectory. Kienzle and five Detroit-area Roman Catholic priests  have filed suit in a Detroit federal court, seeking more than $1 million in  damages.  </P> <P> Kienzle is an ex-priest turned author whose priest-sleuth character, Father  Koesler, is featured in several books and the movie "The Rosary Murders." With  the help of his priest friends, Kienzle said, he wrote a treatment for a  proposed comedy series involving four priests in an inner-city rectory. The  idea was submitted to ABC and rejected in 1980. According to the suit, ABC and  Fox used Kienzle's outline to create the short-lived show "Have Faith" last  year. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

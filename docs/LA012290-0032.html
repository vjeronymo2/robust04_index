			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON, D.C.;  </P> <P> BUSH AIDES SUPPORT EPA CABINET STATUS  </P> <P> The White House senior staff has shifted its position and is now advising at  least tacit support of bipartisan legislation to elevate the Environmental  Protection Agency to Cabinet status, an Administration source said. President  Bush has been reluctant to endorse such a move in the past on grounds that  making the Cabinet larger makes it harder to manage the government.  </P> <P> However, supporting the idea could bring considerable political benefit to Bush  among environmentalists, who have long pushed the idea. Legislation to make the  EPA the 15th Cabinet department is to be reintroduced in both houses of  Congress within the next few days. Bills also were introduced last year, but  did not make it to the floor of either the House or Senate.  </P></p>

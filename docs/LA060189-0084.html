			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RELATIONSHIP GETS D.A.'S AIDE TAKEN OFF CASE  </P> <P> A Ventura County deputy district attorney was removed from a kidnaping trial  that began Wednesday after it was revealed that he had developed a relationship  with the defendant's ex-wife.  </P> <P> Terence M. Kilbride, a deputy district attorney since 1975 and a Ventura  Unified School District trustee since 1980, was dismissed from the case two  weeks ago when his superiors learned that his admiring letters to the woman  were in the hands of the defendant's attorney.  </P> <P> "Any time that a personal relationship could affect or appear to affect the  judgment of a prosecutor, it is standard practice that the case be handled by  somebody else," said Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Vincent J. O'Neill Jr., adding  that his office is conducting an internal investigation into the matter.  </P> <P> According to O'Neill, Kilbride developed a relationship with Cindy Cozzolino in  early 1987, after he won a conviction against her former husband, Larry  Badgwell, for kidnaping a Port Hueneme man who allegedly owed him $20,000 for a  cocaine deal.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Conviction Overturned  </P> <P> Badgwell's conviction was overturned by the state Court of Appeal in January,  1988, and the new trial began this week.  </P> <P> However, letters from Kilbride to Cozzolino included in the court file indicate  that his relationship with the Orange County woman continued until at least  August, 1988.  </P> <P> Kilbride, who declined to discuss specifics of the incident, said that he  allowed himself to remain on the case after the relationship had developed  because "it wasn't an appropriate time" to stop seeing Cozzolino.  </P> <P> But Badgwell's attorney, Charles L. Cassy, said Badgwell had reestablished a  friendly relationship with Cozzolino since the appellate court overturned the  conviction.  </P> <P> "It is apparent . . . that the district attorney in this as well as the  district attorney's office would be unable to proceed in an unbiased and  neutral prosecutorial capacity," Cassy contended in court documents.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Frederick Jones, however, agreed to let the prosecutor's  office handle the second trial of Badgwell, as long as Kilbride was off the  case.  </P></p>

			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Management: Bureaucrats are called to account - Michael Smith assesses the Civil Service salary scheme The teacups in Whitehall must have rattled more loudly than usual when John Major announced details of his Citizen's Charter a year ago. Every civil servant was to be affected; not only were they expected to provide a better service, their pay would depend on it. The government made clear that it wanted a rapid extension of performance pay and more delegation of decisions on pay to departmental level. Performance pay has long been a feature of the private sector: recent surveys have indicated that more than two-thirds of private sector companies have performance pay schemes for at least part of their white-collar workforce. However, the link between pay and performance in the public sector has, until now, been relatively limited. The Citizen's Charter proposals amounted to the most significant reform in a decade in the way the pay of 500,000 civil servants was to be determined. While the politicians had a broad view of what they wanted to achieve, the detailed work fell in large part to pay negotiators in the Treasury. One year on, as the Civil Service pay round ends, these negotiators should be reasonably satisfied with their efforts. Initially, all five of the main trade unions either opposed or had strong reservations about increasing performance pay and the devolution of bargaining. Four of the unions have now agreed to deals incorporating both elements; the fifth, the Inland Revenue Staff Federation, has tacitly agreed to performance pay from next year. From the government's point of view, the price of the unions' agreement has not been high, particularly when compared with the experience of many private sector employers: higher than normal pay deals often have to be paid in industry in the year that new bargaining arrangements are introduced. Virtually all the Civil Service deals this year have been around 4 per cent. While the increase is higher than inflation, it is still at the bottom end of what is permissible under a long-term pay formula - linking pay to the middle 50 per cent of rises in the private sector. In effect, little if anything has been paid for the changes. There are three reasons why all of this suggests competence, rather than miracle working, on the part of the Treasury and Inland Revenue negotiators. Few employees want to take industrial action during a recession, however much they may oppose their employers' wishes. Only one Civil Service union, the National Union of Civil and Public Servants, seriously threatened industrial action but was unable to win members' support. The new Civil Service pay system is considerably less of a threat to unions than many schemes in the private sector. Some employers bringing in performance-related pay have sought, at the same time, to derecognise unions. In the Civil Service there has never been any suggestion of this. Under revised long-term agreements, the unions will continue to negotiate national pay rises each year. Civil servants will depend for only some of their annual rise on performance and the rest will come automatically, as a result of the national negotiations. The new system has been sold by union leaders to members as an improvement over an earlier, more limited scheme introduced in the late 1980s. Says Barry Reamsbottom, general secretary of the Civil and Public Services Association, the largest Civil Service union: 'Under the previous system, civil servants generally had to wait five years for a payment. Now there is something every year.' Union leaders have had a strong interest in playing down the less advantageous aspects of the scheme, knowing that, ultimately, the government was prepared to force the changes through. In the case of most junior and middle-ranking civil servants, performance-related payments will merely replace increments that they would have received under the previous systems, equivalent to between 4 and 6 per cent of salary. None the less, there will be something extra, generally a further percentage point, for civil servants whose performance is judged to be in 'box two'. There are five boxes altogether on assessment forms, ranging from box one for excellent, to box five for unsatisfactory. Box one performers will receive a further 2 percentage points. Managers will also have the discretion to award one-off payments, which are not consolidated into salary. The downside for civil servants is that box five performers and even some in box four will receive no performance award at all. For senior civil servants - including senior professionals and what used to be known as assistant secretaries and principals - performance pay will be more at the discretion of managers and structures will be less rigid. That at least is the theory. The test of the new systems has yet to come. Their success will depend in large part on the ability of departments to develop performance appraisal systems which are both seen as fair by staff and are robust enough to indicate whether performance really is being improved.</p>

This lot has also befallen the victorious Vladimir Volfovich.    Drunk with a comparatively easy victory (neither he nor his  Parteigenossen [party comrades] had expected this kind of  triumph), the Liberal-Democrat set out on a honeymoon tour of  Germany, which lies so close to his heart. Yet another trip of  his was organized by Gerhard Frey, the leader of the German  People's Union, who is known for his extreme right convictions  and a friendship of long duration with Zh.    Unlike government delegations, the number of participants in  the visit was relatively small--the leader, two bodyguards, and  several party colleagues. However, the reception the leader got  from like-minded people was not marked by such modesty. As on  all his visits, Vladimir Volfovich stayed only in the luxury  suites of five-star hotels, with appropriate fare.    The enraptured German patriots enthusiastically asked him  for  his autograph; statements by the Russian fuehrer (meaning  leader) about the "Anschluss"--the annexation of Austria and  Slovenia to Germany and the arrival of the Aryans on the shores  of the Adriatic Sea were very much to their liking. In one city  they even carried V.V. on the German flag to the sound of  applause. To be sure, it was unknown whether there was a  swastika on the flag, but if there was, the Liberal-Democrat  shielded it with his body.    Newspapers were full of articles about the life of the "new  Russian leader." Even materials from party organs such as SOKOLY  ZHIRINOVSKOGO were being constantly reprinted. Citizens  attended, with tremendous pleasure, paid press conferences: The  enterprising Zh. charged credulous philistines admission in  order improve his financial standing, which had been greatly  shaken after electoral clashes.    As far as a ban on entering Germany for the Russian  National-Socialist, he was not particularly concerned about it.  Not long ago V.V. called his headquarters, announced that was  doing just fine, and asked how things were going in Moscow.    He was right to ask. In the opinion of Sergey Zharikov,  editor in chief of SOKOL ZHIRINOVSKOGO, and many other party  members, LDP [Liberal-Democratic Party] functionaries had sent  the leader on the tour specifically in order to resolve certain  issues behind his back: to expand the LDP staff and fill it with  their own people. In the words of "incorruptible fighters," a  number of the most prominent figures of the party are confirmed  communists who very much dislike the fact that the anticommunist  Zhirinovskiy wields absolute power. And they badly want to throw  their own weight around. This is precisely why human multitudes  are now streaming into the LDP. Many businessmen drive right up  in foreign-made cars, with their sable-clad wives, to sign up as  Liberal-Democrats. The headquarters is beginning to look like  the Smolnyy Institution in October [1917].    However, Zhirinovskiy is either unafraid of the fifth column  or does not take it seriously, or puts his faith in the magic  powers of a red jacket cut from an enchanted Tibetan fabric  which he has taken along. After the German tour he went, without  going home, to Austria--independent for now--and after that,  according to preliminary information, to Switzerland, to the  local Liberal-Democrats.    Let us hope that he will not come back from Lenin's  Switzerland in an impounded railway car.</p>

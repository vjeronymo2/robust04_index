			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO FIRM'S AUDIOCASSETTES TURN NEWSLETTER INDUSTRY ON ITS EAR  </P> <P> When most corporate executives realize their company is headed for disaster,  they worry. They fret about their futures; they suffer high anxiety.  </P> <P> But when then-Senior Vice President Vicki Krantz learned that Central Savings  &amp; Loan Assn. would inevitably be a casualty of the great shakeout in the  thrift industry, she reacted differently. Although she knew the end of her job  was in sight in 1985 when it became clear that Central would have to be  acquired by a healthier institution, she kept calm.  </P> <P> "I had a wonderful experience," Krantz said of the period before Central's  demise and acquisition by Coast Savings in 1986.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Increased Responsibility  </P> <P> As the situation at Central was worsening, making it harder to attract new  executives, Krantz, 42, who had joined the company as vice president and  personnel director in 1978, assumed increasing responsibility. By 1985, she was  in charge of Central's 50-plus branches and was chief executive officer of the  bank's luxury hotel development at Lake Arrowhead.  </P> <P> Those duties put her on the road a lot. While driving in her BMW 733, she often  thought about the work she had left at the office, particularly the mountains  of reading she had to complete to stay abreast of developments in human  resources, perhaps her most important responsibility as Central's business  wound down. If only she could read in the car or have the information recorded  so she could listen while driving.  </P> <P> One day it occurred to her that, when her job at Central ended, she could  produce a newsletter on audiocassette summarizing the key issues facing human  resource professionals. As a past president of the Personnel Management Assn.  of San Diego, a former district representative to the American Society of  Personnel Administration and a personnel executive at RCA and May Co. before  coming to Central, she certainly had the proper credentials.  </P> <P> True, she didn't know anything about audio publishing, but she felt she could  learn, having majored in journalism at Cal State Northridge.  </P> <P> So, when Central's struggle finally came to a close in 1986, Krantz took her  $40,000 completion bonus for staying to the bitter end and set up Professional  NewsScan in her home in Solana Beach. She gave herself 2 months to see whether  the concept would work.  </P> <P> It did. Now, with more than 2,000 subscribers paying $144 a year for a dozen  45-minute summaries on human resource issues -- culled from the trade and  general business press -- Krantz has carved a small but unusual niche in the  burgeoning field of audio publishing. The company was profitable after 18  months, and Krantz hopes to double its subscriber base this year. In addition  to four regular news categories concentrating on legislation and legal  developments, each tape covers 10 to 12 topics such as age discrimination and  severance-pay plans.  </P> <P> The first thing Krantz did was write a business plan. Working with her husband,  Fred -- now a management consultant but formerly a vice president and general  manager at General Dynamics Electronics Division and Topaz Electronics -- she  calculated the price she would have to charge to have a viable business.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Studio Located  </P> <P> Next, she turned to the Yellow Pages to find local recording studios, quizzing  them on how to produce professional-quality audiotape. She eventually struck a  deal with Lightning Corp. in Kearny Mesa, where, she said, employees "were  ready to roll up their sleeves to help out."  </P> <P> Then she began to read. She reviewed 90 magazines, ranging from the Academy of  Management Journal to Working Mother, and wrote a script summarizing human  resource issues in the news that month. She said she spends more than $5,000 a  year on subscriptions to periodicals.  </P> <P> In August, 1986, at a cost of more than $9,000, Krantz sent 5,000 sample tapes  to members of the American Society for Personnel Administration. What followed  was "the longest two weeks of my life, waiting to see what would come back,"  Krantz recalled.  </P> <P> Although the returns, at nearly 2%, were not overwhelming, they fell into the  range she had predicted in her business plan. "Then we knew we had a business,"  she said.  </P> <P> What Krantz didn't know was that the business she had entered could be on the  brink of significant growth. According to Seth Gershel, director of sales for  Simon &amp; Schuster's audio division and the organizer of the Audio Publishers  Assn., audio publishing (which most people know as books on tape) has had  double-digit growth for 3 years.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Big Business'  </P> <P> "It is big business," said Mark Hinckley, editor of Magazine and Bookseller  magazine, a trade publication that has tracked the industry for three years.  "And the potential seems greater."  </P> <P> According to Publishers Weekly, another trade magazine, commonly accepted  research indicates that audio publishing is a $100-million industry evenly  divided between retail sales and direct mail. Audio versions of best-selling  fiction represent about 41% of the market. Business information represents  about 11%.  </P> <P> "We think those numbers are low," said Paul Houston, president of ManagersEdge  Corp. in Denver, which markets audiotapes, including Krantz's, to senior  executives of small and medium-size companies.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not That Ambitious  </P> <P> Houston believes that more than 500,000 people a year buy business-oriented  audiotapes through the mail. The acknowledged market leader is Chicago's  Nightingale-Conant, with revenues of $40 million. "The total market is at least  $60 million to $70 million," Houston said. ManagersEdge has 11,000 subscribers,  and Houston foresees a total potential customer base of 60,000.  </P> <P> Krantz, who reads for the cassettes herself, is not that ambitious. There are  about 40,000 human resource professionals in the country, she noted.  </P> <P> She said she would be content with 5,000 subscribers, and wants to have 4,000  within the next year.  </P> <P> Busy commuters who want to make maximum use of their time represent the best  target audience for audio publishing products, according to Houston. "Our  biggest competitor is probably car phones," he said.  </P> <P> Krantz is prepared to compete with those. Nearly 90% of her listeners say they  listen to the tapes while in their car. The national average commute time is 22  minutes, Krantz said, the approximate length of each side of her tapes.  </P> <P> "I listen to and from work," said Dee Tielhet, personnel section manager at  Hewlett-Packard in San Diego. "I live about 20 minutes away from the office."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Others Listen Too  </P> <P> Her department of 16 people is responsible for the human resource needs of  1,500 Hewlett-Packard employees. When Tielhet finishes listening to a cassette,  she passes it on to others in the department. ManagersEdge research indicates  that, for every subscriber to such tapes, two more people listen.  </P> <P> Bea Betterton, personnel director of the YMCA of San Diego County, lives just  15 minutes from her workplace. But she listens to Professional NewsScan when  she travels from branch to branch for meetings. N. Bruce Ferris, manager of  personnel and employee relations at Maxwell Laboratories, listens on his way to  and from Orange County.  </P> <P> Why do they listen?  </P> <P> "It is a unique, super service," according to Ferris.  </P> <P> Krantz's tapes cover some of the most sensitive issues confronting corporate  America today: managing health-care benefits, dealing with AIDS, new federal  guidelines to ensure a drug-free workplace.  </P></p>

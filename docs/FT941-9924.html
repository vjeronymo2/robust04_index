			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: S&amp;P says Italian bank ratings under pressure The long-term credit ratings of Italian commercial banks are under considerable downward pressure because of worries about the quality of bank assets, the US ratings agency Moody's Investor Services said yesterday. In a strongly pessimistic report on Italy's 280 commercial banks, Moody's said that they were suffering from poor asset quality, mediocre control of operating expenses, and pressure on margins between deposit and loan interest rates. Moody's said that the median long-term debt rating of banks had already fallen three notches from the Aa1 level of a year ago. Although the immediate cause was the lowered ceiling rating for Italy, it might have happened in any case. The Moody's report says that difficulties facing Italian banks due to domestic recession and exposure from rapid loan growth in the past few years are an extreme case of those experienced in other deregulated banking markets. The pessimism of Moody's assessment is likely to reinforce concerns over the effect on continental European banking systems of the prolonged recession.</p>

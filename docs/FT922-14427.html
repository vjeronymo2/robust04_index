			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / People: Summing up for their lordships David Carter has become head of the 60-strong forensic accounting team at KPMG Peat Marwick with a mission to ensure that accountants assert their influence in the courts. Forensic accounting involves a wide range of court-related work including investigating fraud, valuing companies, assessing damages and acting as expert witness on accounting issues. Carter says: 'My aim is to make sure that wherever accountants are more appropriate than lawyers, they are allowed to do the work.' He replaces Michael Renshall, the chairman of the former Accounting Standards Committee, and stresses: 'There is no sense of a household revolution. Michael is just easing off but will continue to be a part of the team.' Carter, 54, was previously head of corporate finance at KPMG, and has previously held a number of senior managerial positions. He began by studying law at university but switched to history, and believes accountancy involves a 'happy mix' of words and numbers. 'I have a limited amount of grey hair,' he adds. 'It does help when you are in front of their lordships.'</p>

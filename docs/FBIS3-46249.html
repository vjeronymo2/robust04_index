China's  Environmental Protection Achievements Attract Worldwide  Attention    China's economy has entered another period of rapid  development in the 1990's.    Economic development, population growth, and higher  consumption levels mean our country faces the threat of a global  environmental problem. Moreover, with the increased degree of  development and urbanization, as well as the development of  village and town enterprises, environmental pollution and  ecological damage accompanying our economic development have  increasingly become an important factor actually obstructing our  economic and social development.    In 1993, the World Environmental Day meeting and award  ceremony for the world's "top 500" were held in Beijing. The  event attracted worldwide attention for China's environmental  protection.    In environmental protection, China has always been in the  front ranks of developing countries.    Many of our achievements have gone down in the history of  civilization:    -- Ecological agriculture has spread across the country,  with  the establishment of several thousand ecological agriculture  experimental units of various types and size. As early as the  beginning of the 1980's, China stopped the production of  insecticides with strong poisons and high residue. The  agricultural department began experimenting on pollution-free  production and made new progress in afforestation on plains and  along coastal regions. In particular, the shelter-forest project  in the northeast-north-northwest region is known as "the world's  best ecological project."    -- Success has been achieved in preventing industrial  pollution. A large number of industrial pollution control  facilities built in our country in the 1980's have successively  yielded results, raising the rate of disposal of three wastes  [waste gas, waste water, and industrial residue], as well as the  up-to-standard rate, remarkably.    -- China's urban environmental situation has improved  remarkably. As a result of the comprehensive efforts to improve  the environment, the environmental quality of many cities has  become better to varying degrees. Despite large increases in  the urban population and energy consumption, urban atmospheric  conditions have basically not worsened and the amount of some  pollutants in the atmosphere have even decreased, thanks to  various urban air pollution control measures.    China's environmental protection has unique features, which  have attracted the attention of the Third World.  <H3>  2. Our Country Still Faces Grim Environmental Protection  Prospects At a Time of Rapid Economic Development </H3>   According to relevant departments, our country should  soberly  assess its current status of environment protection, despite its  tremendous achievements in preventing and controlling industrial  pollution. In the past year, some newly-launched projects,  especially "wholly or partly foreign-owned" construction  projects in development zones, continued to develop new  pollution sources because they failed to strictly implement  relevant state regulations mandating environmental impact  assessments, and the "simultaneous construction of projects and  facilities to control three wastes." Pollution in village and  town enterprises worsened with each passing day, and the general  level of industrial pollution increased.    In 1992, 36.6 billion metric tons of waste water was  released  across the country, up nine percent from 1991; this figure does  not cover village and town enterprises. The amount of waste  water released last year was significantly higher than that  discharged in the preceding year. Although the water quality in  the main course of the Chang Jiang is good, pollution is quite  serious near the river banks in sections that run through the  major cities of Chongqing, Wuhan, Nanjing, and Shanghai. Only  41 percent of the 38,000-km stretches of the seven major rivers  and inland rivers subject to water quality tests measure up to  first- and second-class water quality standards, whereas 48  percent indicate fairly serious pollution. Surface water  pollution is serious in the cities, with the river stretches in  80 percent of the cities suffering varying degrees of pollution.  Statistics on 67 cities show that the annual and daily average  levels of suspended atmospheric particles in approximately half  of those cities exceed the limits. The annual and daily average  levels of sulfur dioxide in 13 cities exceed secondary state  limits.    Our country's ecological problems also cannot be neglected.    The devastating sandstorm that erupted in the northwest on 5  May 1993 left 85 people dead and 31 missing. Once again, we  were given a warning of ecological destruction.    The entire country is suffering from grassland degradation,  desertification, salinization, and alkalinization. The illegal  occupation and utilization of farmland has yet to be completely  halted.    Soil erosion is serious. A recent survey shows that 1.93  million square km [sq km] and 1.88 million sq km of land is  affected by water and wind erosion, respectively. A sandstorm  danger line totaling 10,000 li has been formed in northwest,  north, and northeast China. Approximately one-third of the  country's land is threatened by sandstorms, and more than 60  percent of impoverished counties in our country are concentrated  within this line. Economic losses from sandstorms reach 4.5  billion yuan annually.  <H3>  3. The Entire Country Was Buffeted by the Environmental  Protection Wave in 1993 </H3>   Last spring, the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC]  decided to create an Environmental Protection Committee. Never  before had our country set up environmental protection  committees under both the government and the NPC.    On 27 May, the State Environmental Protection Bureau  released  the names of 3,000 key pollution-causing enterprises in an  attempt to encourage enterprises to control pollution. Unlike  in the past when enterprises were allocated "spots" in order of  their output value, profits, and taxes, they were listed  according to the amount of effluents. Some of the large and  medium enterprises which had previously been considered  "efficient" were on the list. The move caused quite a stir  throughout the country.    In 1993, work to set up environmental indices was carried  out gradually across the country. The establishment of an  environmental index system is an environmental protection  measure that is suited to the socialist market economy.  Completely banning the movement of rhinoceros horns and tiger  bone -- including medicines and handicrafts made of relevant  materials -- into and out of the country is an important measure  taken by our country to honor international conventions and to  protect wildlife; the same can be said of completely banning the  sale, purchase, carrying, and mailing of such products. At a  national conference on industrial pollution prevention and  control in Shanghai in October, Zhu Rongji, vice premier of the  State Council, stated: Environmental protection has strong  technical, economic, and legal implications. As in quality  control work, we should heighten the environmental awareness of  all people. It is wrong to think that pollution control can be  spared to save money and accelerate industrial development. If  we fail to control pollution, we will end up spending more money  and will be unable to recoup losses that we have incurred. He  stressed the need to combine environmental protection with  comprehensive utilization, to protect and make full use of  national resources, to generate economic returns, and to clean  up the environment.    The general inspection of the nationwide enforcement of  environmental protection laws organized by the Environmental  Protection Committees under the NPC and the State Council, as  well as activities launched in October in connection with  China's March Toward An Environmental Protection Century, have  had an extensive impact on all localities across the country.    The high-standard and large-scale inspection of  environmental  protection law enforcement, which was launched for the first  time since our country began its environmental protection  program 20 years ago, has focused on seven provinces and  autonomous regions, including Heilongjiang, Shandong, Guangdong,  Anhui, and Jiangsu. It also covers 43 cities and counties and  166 factories in those provinces and autonomous regions. A  number of cases involving environmental law violations and  wildlife destruction have been investigated and dealt with. An  example is the destruction of resources and the environment as a  result of the illegal sale of rhinoceros horns in Wuchuan  County, Guangdong Province; the extraction of gall secretion  from live bears on the Zhuhai Bear Farm; the illegal  construction of a seriously polluting cement plant in the Shilin  tourist spot by the Jianan Company in Lunan County, Yunnan  Province; and illegal gold mining in the Altun Mountain Nature  Reserve. Besides citing negative examples for educational  purposes, the state has issued a circular to commend a large  number of advanced environmental protection models and  instances. This has led to the enactment of local environmental  protection laws and heightened the environmental protection  awareness of local cadres and people. In Shandong, Governor  Zhao Zhihao has urged leading cadres at all levels to "become  accomplished individuals instead of a culpable generation" in  environmental protection work.    "China's March Toward An Environmental Protection Century,"  attended by as many as 100 reporters from scores of news  organizations, has had a great impact nationwide. For 20 days  in a row, the China Central Television Station, during its  National News Hookup program, broadcast reports on environmental  protection from various areas, an unprecedented event since the  founding of our country's television station. Many of the  problems reflected during "China's March Toward An Environmental  Protection Century" have attracted the attention of leaders at  all levels, who have taken action to solve them. For instance,  the report on environmental pollution and ecological destruction  as a consequence of energy development in areas linking Shanxi,  Shaanxi, and Inner Mongolia has attracted the attention of State  Council leaders. In mid-December, the State Council's  Environmental Protection Committee held an on-site inspection  and work meeting to solve the pollution problems of the "Black  Triangle" of energy.    Mankind is marching toward the 21st century.    China's environmental protection is also marching toward the  21st century.    China's environmental and development goals are magnificent.  China is capable of seeking the ultimate solution to its  environmental problems while maintaining sustained economic  development.</p>

			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY PEOPLE  </P> <P>  Diodes Inc., a struggling semiconductor maker in Chatsworth, revamped its  board of directors at the urging of its biggest stockholder, Microsemi Corp.  </P> <P> Four non-management directors -- Dorothy N. Lloyd, Charles A. Benak, Albert F.  Ottobre and Ted G. Slate -- resigned from the board, and Diodes appointed two  new outside directors: Harold Harrigan, a partner at the investment firm  Crowell Weedon &amp; Co., and Michael A. Rosenberg, president of SFE  Technologies, an electronic components company in San Fernando.  </P> <P> Three directors retained their seats: David M. Lloyd, Diodes' chairman and  chief executive; Alan B. Lees, Diodes' vice president and general counsel, and  Maurice L. Muehle, another outside director.  </P> <P> The new five-member board will be elected annually. Previously Diodes had a  staggered board whereby only two or three directors were elected each year.  </P> <P> Diodes, which lost $2.9 million in its fiscal year that ended April 30, said  the board structure was suggested by Microsemi, a Santa Ana electronics concern  that owns 25% of Diodes.  </P> <P> Lees said Microsemi "felt the board would be more effective" in its new format.  Asked if Microsemi urged the changes because of Diodes' recent performance,  Lees replied: "I don't think it was the immediate reason," but added that  "obviously all the shareholders are not too happy with the losses we've  posted."  </P></p>

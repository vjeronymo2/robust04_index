			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: International safeguards for Thorp reprocessing plant 'first class' Sir, Mr Llew Smith complains that British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL) has repeatedly failed to provide him with a document on the international safeguards arrangements for Thorp (Letters, November 23). I am completely mystified by this. The document, published by the European Commission, is a public document and if he cares to ask me for one I will send it to him immediately. When Mr Smith reads it, he will realise that the international safeguards arrangements for Thorp are first class and will provide an extremely high level of independent assurance that the nuclear material, all of which is for peaceful, civil use, is under proper control. Indeed, during an international conference in May 1993, senior Euratom officials concluded that the safeguards techniques implemented in Thorp provide '. . . a sound system of safeguards activities . . . ensuring that this major industrial size reprocessing complex can be controlled under international safeguards to provide a high degree of assurance'. What else would you expect after an internal technical programme spanning 10 years, detailed discussions over seven years with Euratom concerning implementation of safeguards, and a four-year international study (Lascar) involving the US administration and the International Atomic Energy Authority.

			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Bristol (16): Set for expansion - Company profile of Badgerline The headquarters of what has become Britain's second-largest bus operator might be assumed to be utilitarian offices next to a noisy depot. Instead, it is to be found in a renovated farmhouse six miles from Weston-super-Mare, surrounded by fields and approached across a cattle grid. Badgerline employs 10,700 people and runs 3,900 vehicles. But at the headquarters - renamed Badger Manor after the company moved there in 1989 - there is only a dozen staff. From this modest base, Mr Trevor Smallwood, the executive chairman, and his fellow directors saw the company floated on the stock exchange in November last year, raising Pounds 35m. The company was established in 1986 when it was bought out by its management and employees - Mr Smallwood was the managing director - from National Bus Company as part of the government's privatisation programme. Badgerline then had an annual turnover of Pounds 15m and 400 vehicles. For the half-year to June 30, it reported a turnover of Pounds 93.3m and pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.4m, up from Pounds 2.6m in the same period last year. The flotation, with the Bristol offices of KPMG Peat Marwick and Burges Salmon, the law firm, as advisers, was intended to provide funds for expansion and acquisitions. As a result, PMT Group, based in Staffordshire and Cheshire, was bought for Pounds 23m and the Yorkshire-based Rider Group for Pounds 38m. The two companies, which have a total fleet of nearly 1,600 vehicles, have already boosted profits. Mr Chris Carr, marketing director, pronounces the company as 'very satisfied' with its decision to float. In Bristol, Badgerline is known for its City Line subsidiary, which has 1,000 staff, a fleet of 353 vehicles, and a turnover of some Pounds 23m. Mr Smallwood says that, since deregulation, the number of buses in the area has risen from 207 to 319 and operating miles have increased greatly. More than half the fleet has been replaced in the past four years. Overall, Badgerline has bought 370 new vehicles this year. This summer, it placed orders for 900 vehicles at a cost of almost Pounds 60m, believed to be the largest order yet placed by a non-publicly-owned bus company. Mr Smallwood, whose career began with Yorkshire Traction in 1966, comments: 'There is public recognition that we cannot continue in urban areas to use the car ad infinitum - the only way is to develop and improve public transport.'</p>

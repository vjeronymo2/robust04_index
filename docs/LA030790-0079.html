			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIKE DOWNEY: JUST HAVING A SHOT IS OK BY WYNALDA  </P> <P> He still doesn't know for sure if he will get to set foot on the World Cup  soccer fields of Italy in June, but now, more than ever, Eric Wynalda of  Westlake Village understands what it would mean to him to be there. He has  known it ever since he scored the United States' only goal in a game against  Colombia on Feb. 4 at Miami, which marked his very first appearance with the  national team.  </P> <P> "I never thought the national anthem could become a religious experience," said  Wynalda, who left San Diego State to concentrate solely on soccer. "Maybe  nobody knows what that feels like until the day you actually get to play  something for your country."  </P> <P> The United States has been booked worldwide as anywhere from a 500-1 to a  1,000-1 longshot to win the World Cup, but Wynalda would like to be on the  premises, just in case. Nobody thought the 1980 hockey team could win in the  Winter Olympics, either.  </P> <P> "Hey, I still believe in miracles," he said. "Nobody thought Buster Douglas had  a shot, either."  </P> <P> A rather striking striker with long, blond hair, Wynalda was not among the  Americans who saved the day on Nov. 19 by beating Trinidad and Tobago, 1-0,  thereby qualifying for the World Cup for the first time in 40 years. He wasn't  one of them until Coach Bob Gansler ran a tryout camp two months later in La  Jolla, during which Wynalda impressed him enough to earn an invitation to Miami  for the Marlboro Cup.  </P> <P> The United States was having trouble scoring goals. It had gone scoreless for  238 miserable minutes between the seventh and 10th qualifying matches of the  World Cup, before Paul Caligiuri's memorable goal in Trinidad. It had scored  only 11 goals in 10 games -- five of them in one contest against Jamaica.  </P> <P> Gansler's hair was getting grayer by the day. He was tired of scoreless ties.  He also was irritated by certain members of the media branding him as too  conservative a coach and saying that he played too defensive a style. There was  nothing wrong with the U.S. team, the coach insisted, that a few well-placed  kicks and a couple of lucky bounces couldn't cure.  </P> <P> But, as Gansler later put it, once frustration sets in, after a while "the net  starts to shrink."  </P> <P> That's why he continued searching for scorers. So, when Wynalda went to La  Jolla in early January, he found himself among 26 other gifted players, all  auditioning after one fashion or another for Gansler. Competition for roster  spots was stiff. And not every top player was present. Hugo Perez, the fine  midfielder whose goal won the El Salvador game, was, for example, off playing  in Europe.  </P> <P> Jobs were available, but scarce. There were guys who had played in the Major  Indoor Soccer League, guys who had excelled on the college level, guys who had  already demonstrated their skills for Gansler in World Cup qualifying rounds,  all hoping to score big with the coach.  </P> <P> "Everybody there was trying to prove some point," Wynalda said. "All I could do  was the best I could. I didn't even know until I read it in the paper that  (Gansler) regarded me as the No. 1 striker coming out of that camp. At least,  that's what I read.  </P> <P> "Everybody eventually has a sitdown with Bob Gansler, and when I had mine, I  was on the edge of my seat. But by the time he took me to Miami, I felt that I  had earned a chance to start. I proved to him that I can play at that level. I  forced his hand a little to play me, or at least I hope I did."  </P> <P> Wynalda responded with the team's only goal against Colombia, beating an  offside trap and scoring from 18 yards out. Later, he assisted on the lone U.S.  goal in a 1-0 exhibition victory over a team from Bermuda. His decision to  devote himself to soccer was paying off.  </P> <P> "I wasn't happy at San Diego State," Wynalda said. "It had nothing to do with  the team there or the school itself. It was just me. It got to the point where  I was playing and thinking soccer, and trying to get grades just to stay  eligible. It wasn't the proper way to attend college.  </P> <P> "I'd always envisioned myself as being a professional soccer player, and the  time was right to address myself to that. Since I was 5, that's all I ever  wanted to do. And how many chances come along to play in a World Cup?"  </P> <P> Not many, for an American. Not any, since 1950.  </P> <P> Now, as the team travels to Tampa, Fla., this week for a tuneup game against  Finland, Wynalda and his sidekicks wait -- to see who gets to go to Italy. The  coach is still looking for forwards to do more scoring. Wynalda thinks these  are shoes he can fill.  </P> <P> If America is really a 1,000-1 shot, he'd like a piece of that action.  </P></p>

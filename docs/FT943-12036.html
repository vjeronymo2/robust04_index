			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Property disposals help Allied Textile rise 28% Allied Textile Companies, one of Britain's leading fabric and fibre manufacturers, yesterday highlighted improving sales and profits on property disposals as the main factors behind a 28 per cent increase in half-year profits. The Yorkshire-based group defied tough trading conditions in the six months to March 31 by increasing pre-tax profits from Pounds 5.3m to Pounds 6.8m on turnover of Pounds 69.1m (Pounds 64.5m). The improvement was underpinned by profits from financial activities, which more than doubled to Pounds 2.3m (Pounds 1.1m) following the disposal of a former mill at Huddersfield. Operating profits in the core textile businesses rose by a more modest 7 per cent to Pounds 4.5m (Pounds 4.2m), but Mr Peter Honeysett, chairman, said it represented 'very satisfactory progress in the face of fitful trading conditions'. That progress was dominated by steady profits in the UK, where there was a first-time contribution from Coatings Applications, the Lancashire-based fabric treatment business acquired last October for Pounds 8.5m. In continental Europe, however, an improved performance at Allied Textile France SARL - the group's French subsidiary - was undermined by more than Pounds 2.5m in start up costs and depreciation charges on a new needle punch carpet line at Tapibel, the Belgian carpet manufacturer. Allied's recent acquisitions in North America, where it established a foothold earlier this year with the Pounds 29.3m purchase of Cleyn &amp; Tinker and Carleton, did not impact on the half-year figures. 'They have both made a good start and are operating in line with our best expectations,' said Mr Honeysett. Earnings per share came out at 15.37p (12.57p) and an increased interim dividend of 4.8p (4.6p) is declared. COMMENT With textile demand in Britain showing little sign of rapid recovery, the timing of Allied's expansion into North America is looking increasingly shrewd. Carleton and Cleyn &amp; Tinker are expected to make useful second-half contributions, which could offset any further downturn at home. Operating profits may also be enhanced by improved productivity at Tapibel, which supplies the lucrative German market. However, there are unlikely to be further gains on property disposals and analysts have left their forecasts for full-year pre-tax profits unchanged at Pounds 17.5m. The shares, which closed down 2p at 533p, look slightly over-priced on a forward multiple of 14.4, given the uncertainties over domestic growth.</p>

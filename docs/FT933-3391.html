			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Boots plans 240 new high street chemists stores BOOTS the Chemists yesterday gave a robust defence of its growth prospects, saying it planned to open 240 new high street chemists stores by 1997, and still saw scope for increasing profit margins. Presenting the strategy Mr Gordon Hourston, managing director, attempted to counter City fears that there was little room for further profits growth at the chain, which contributed 67 per cent of group sales and 70 per cent of pre-tax profits last year. Those fears have contributed to a significant underperformance by the shares this year. They closed 8p down at 489p yesterday. Mr Hourston said that in five years, the chemists chain had increased pre-tax profits from Pounds 151m to Pounds 285m and sales from Pounds 2.08bn to Pounds 2.66bn. It had also increased its return on capital employed from 35.5 per cent to 64.4 per cent, about three times that of the biggest grocery superstores. 'We see at least as much scope for shareholder value growth now as we did five years ago,' Mr Hourston said. He added that Boots had not been hurt by high-profile price-cutting campaigns by its rival Superdrug on fragrances, condoms and sun-care products. He said that Boots, which followed Superdrug's move by slashing the prices of 22 suncare products, had increased its market share from 45 per cent to more than 50 per cent as a result. He added that there was still considerable scope for increasing gross margins. Mr Ian Webster, director of planning, said that across 24 product areas, the contribution per sq m of floor space varied widely, and by experimenting with such factors as product mix and shelf-space allocation, the contribution of under-performers could be improved. Some unprofitable categories could be discontinued. Boots is trialling different approaches to improving the performance of unprofitable ranges across its 1,100 stores. The chain is continuing to expand its own brand products, which make higher gross margins, and of which 33 per cent are manufactured by the group. It is stepping up its battle with Body Shop by launching a new 'global collection' of toiletries and cosmetics made from natural ingredients. Another prong of Boots' strategy is to expand its network of small chemists, opening one store every 10 days for the next four years. Mr Ron Glaister, director of stores, said the small stores made the biggest return on capital, and the company had identified 240 target sites. An experimental programme has also begun of opening outlets inside Sainsbury's superstores. Boots said the seven outlets now operating differed in their siting and product mix, but overall, their performance was above expectations. See Lex</p>

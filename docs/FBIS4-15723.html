			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Excerpts] [Announcer] For the second time in the past two  days NATO aircraft have bombed Bosnian Serb positions near the  town of Gorazde. [passage omitted] Our correspondent Vladimir  Solovyev spoke to Vitaliy Ivanovich Churkin:    [Begin recording] [Solovyev] Vitaliy Ivanovich, did Moscow  know about the forthcoming airstrikes against Serb positions?    [Churkin] All last week we were following closely the  situation around Gorazde, especially when it became aggravated.  But in the crucial hours we did not know about any aggravation.  The UN people explain this by the fact that everything happened  very quickly. Two hours passed between General Rose's first  warning that he was going to ask for air support and the actual  air strikes. In this situation we have certain complaints about  UN people, and Bosnian Serbs, for that matter, because when in  the last few days we drew their attention to the impermissible,  very dangerous and critical aggravation of the situation, their  response was rather slack, they kept saying that nothing special  was going to happen there and that they did not have any  military plans for Gorazde.    I think that if Russia had been invited to tackle this  crisis  spot at the fateful moment, we could have directed the events in  a different channel. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

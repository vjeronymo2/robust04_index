			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> ROGER KINGDOM BEATEN IN HURDLES BY COLIN JACKSON IN 4-NATION MEET  </P> <P> Britain's Colin Jackson handed two-time Olympic champion Roger Kingdom of the  United States a rare defeat in the 110-meter high hurdles tonight in a  four-nation track and field meet.  </P> <P> The United States and Britain each won three of the opening six track events in  the two-day meet that also includes West Germany and the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Among the other early winners were David Patrick of the United States in the  men's 400-meter intermediate hurdles, American Esther Jones in the women's 100  meters, Tim Simon of the United States in the men's 400 and Linford Christie of  Britain in the men's 100.  </P> <P> Jackson, who had not beaten Kingdom in five previous outdoor races, burst out  of the starting blocks and built a sizable lead over Kingdom midway through the  race. Kingdom stumbled and fell at the last hurdle, leaving American Jack  Pierce in second place. Kingdom was unbeaten in 22 races last year, including  17 finals, and had lost only once this season.  </P> <P> Jackson was timed in a sparkling 12.99 seconds, but it was wind-aided.  </P></p>

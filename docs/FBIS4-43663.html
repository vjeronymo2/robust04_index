			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, June 16 (CTK) -- Due to the increased  importance of the Western European Union (WEU) within the  European Union (EU), the Czech Republic's intensified  integration with the EU also means coming closer to the Western  defense systems, Petr Necas, head of a parliamentary delegation,  told CTK today.    The delegation attended the four-day WEU parliamentary  assembly which finished today.    The Czech Republic was granted WEU associate partnership on  May 9.    The Czech Republic's integration with the EU has not only  economic and political dimensions, but also a clear-cut defense  and security aspect, Necas added. The sooner the Czech Republic  joins the EU, the sooner it will join the WEU or NATO, he  specified.    The Czech delegation stressed that it was not correct -- as  it has frequently appeared in the WEU documents -- to regard all  the Central and Eastern countries as one bloc. It pointed to  "wide economic, political, and security differences" between  these countries. "We had to note that the Czech Republic was  stable, heading for prosperity, and undertaking reforms  supported by its population," Necas said.    The Czech delegation has also assured the Western deputies  that the Czech effort to come closer to the WEU was not just a  "panic calling for a security umbrella" in the form of  guarantees, but a sign of sharing the same values. "We want to  protect these values. We want to share our part of  responsibility as evidenced by the presence of the Czech troops  in the Persian Gulf and now in the former Yugoslavia," Necas  said.    The Czech deputies asked the deputies from the nine WEU  member countries to make it possible at their autumn session for  the Czech Republic and other Eastern countries to fully join the  work of the Assembly, except for the voting right. WEU  representatives promised that the association status which was  under preparation would correspond to this. The Czech deputies  proposed that representatives of the WEU and Eastern countries  meet to discuss the contents of the associate partnership in the  coming months in Prague.</p>

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Iraqi farmers offered 200% grain price rises IRAQ, FACING the certainty of an even smaller harvest than last year, is raising government prices for wheat and barley by up to 200 per cent to stop farmers selling to private buyers, reports Reuter from Baghdad. The government announced it would pay farmers D2,250 (Pounds 1,320) dinars a tonne for wheat, compared with D800 last year, and D1,500 a tonne for barley, up from D500. UN experts said they expected this year's wheat and barley crops to be at least 30 per cent below last year's because of UN sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990. Agriculture ministry figures put last year's wheat harvest at 525,000 tonnes, down from 1.19m tonnes in 1990 and the barley crop at 520,000 tonnes, compared with 1.85m tonnes. Shortages of fertiliser, insecticides, irrigated land, spare parts and certified seeds caused the shortfall despite fairly good rains and a full year to recover from the Gulf War. 'It was a fairly good year compared to last but negative factors caused by sanctions will mean the wheat and barley crop is even less,' said one UN expert. 'This trend will doubtless continue until sanctions are lifted.' President Saddam Hussein ordered the price rises. He has vowed Iraq will survive sanctions despite US and British pledges to continue them until he is toppled.</p>

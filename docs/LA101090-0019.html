Cummins of the Catholic Diocese of Oakland told a news  conference that St. Francis de Sales Cathedral and Sacred Heart Church will be  razed. He said the church cannot afford the $8 million it would cost to fix  them. St. Francis, near downtown, was built in 1893. Sacred Heart, in north  Oakland, was built in 1897.  </P></p>

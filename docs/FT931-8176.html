			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / To tax, or not to tax ..: Signs of economic recovery are pushing the UK chancellor into a fiscal dilemma Oddly enough, the past week has been a relatively good one for Mr Norman Lamont. Although UK unemployment burst through the 3m mark in January, other economic indicators have mitigated some of the gloom that settled over the country last month. But it is a measure of the difficulties facing the chancellor that no sooner do the economic skies lift a little than the debate switches to the other huge problem in his in-tray. Britain's growing public deficit casts a long and dark shadow over government economic policy. Every sign that the economy might be improving brings forward the question of whether Mr Lamont's third Budget on March 16 should be the occasion to start increasing taxes to cut the deficit. The chancellor has had conflicting advice at the highest level over the past week. While the board of the International Monetary Fund has urged Britain to tighten fiscal policy, six of his seven-man panel of independent economic forecasters, the Seven Wise Men, yesterday urged him not to raise taxes in the Budget. However, all economic commentators agree that the UK's projected public sector borrowing requirement of Pounds 37bn in 1992-93 or 6.25 per cent of gross domestic product is unsustainable in the long term. Although deficits of Pounds 37bn, or the Pounds 50bn widely expected for 1993-94, may be acceptable in a recession, borrowing on this scale will push up the country's debt service burden and eventually force the government to cut public spending or raise taxes. Mr Lamont has big decisions to take next month. If he tightens policy too soon, he could go down as the man who aborted the long-awaited recovery. If he allows the deficit to grow out of control, history might judge that he condemned Britain to Italian-style fiscal laxity. He has presided over a dramatic easing of policy since September, with sterling devalued by 15 per cent and bank base rates down to 6 per cent from 10 per cent. But Mr Lamont's judgment will hinge crucially on his assessment of present conditions in the UK economy, where the evidence is mixed and confusing. The best that can be said of the economy is that developments are still consistent with the Treasury's Autumn Statement forecast of a meagre 1 per cent growth this year. At the Bank of England, economists still regard the economy as 'bumping along the bottom' of the business cycle. Some encouraging news emerged over the past week. Retail sales, helped by heavy discounting, increased in volume by 1.6 per cent in January, reversing a 1 per cent fall in December. But even here, the tale was not one of unalloyed joy. Seasonally adjusted sales in the three months to January 31 were up by only 0.2 per cent in volume compared with the previous three months. There is little sign of recovery in industry. Manufacturing output inched ahead by less than 0.1 per cent between November and December while output in the three months to December was down a seasonally adjusted 0.2 per cent compared with previous three months. On the other hand, manufacturing productivity has risen sharply, with December's 6 per cent annual rate of growth marking the highest year-on-year rise since April 1989. Higher productivity reflects the past bad news of sharply rising unemployment among manufacturers. But by helping to keep costs under control, it holds out hope for the future. Manufacturers' unit labour costs fell by 0.5 per cent in December compared with a year ago and were flat in the three months to the end of December, easing the impact of the higher imported fuel and raw material costs that have followed sterling's devaluation. Not surprisingly, indicators of business confidence have shown an increase in optimism in recent months. However, measures of consumer confidence and bank and building society lending are far less robust. In the housing sector, there has been the familiar mix of good and bad news. Estate agents polled by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors have reported that house sales continued to improve after Christmas and new year. However, the Building Societies Association said that net new commitments - mortgages promised by lenders - fell by about 18 per cent between December and January and were sharply down on the level of January last year. Gross mortgage lending fell to Pounds 1.8bn in January from Pounds 2.1bn in December. Monetarists also have reason to feel confused. M0, the narrow measure of money supply which consists mainly of cash and bank notes and which is targeted by the Treasury, breached its 0 per cent to 4 per cent annual growth range last month when it rose by an annual 4.1 per cent. However, M4, the broad money measure that includes bank and building society deposits and which should reflect the credit granting of such financial institutions, has been very subdued. Broad money grew by only 3.2 per cent in the year to January, its lowest growth rate since records began. But the 'M's, in so far as they are telling a story of divisions in society, probably contain the best clue as to what is happening in the economy and how Mr Lamont will approach the Budget. The Treasury believes that strong growth in M0 parallels the rise in high street spending. Many in work or retired have cash to spend and have been making the most of the bargains in the shops. The unemployed also tend to live in a more cash-based world. M4's weak performance may be evidence of the continued damage caused by debt deflation, or the erosion of wealth by falling asset prices. According to the Bank of England, more than 1.5m households have negative equity after falling house prices have put the value of their homes below the level of their mortgages. The Bank thinks that debt deflation is the reason why the recession has lasted so long. Its analysis suggests that it would be wrong to pin recovery hopes on increased spending by the heavily indebted. Instead, recovery in the housing and other markets may have to wait until households without debt problems have the courage to borrow and buy assets at bargain prices. The problems of debt deflation and the housing market will probably count against any radical reform of the tax treatment of mortgages in the budget. Mortgage interest relief is a natural target for a chancellor such as Mr Lamont, who fancies himself as a tax reformer and favours tax neutrality - the principle that taxation should not distort economic activity or favour any special group. Mortgage interest relief contradicts this principle and is expensive (costing the Treasury an estimated Pounds 5.2bn this financial year). Although there are good arguments for targeting tax relief on the first-time buyer, who is so crucial in setting up 'chains' of house sales, the chancellor would be brave to tamper with existing arrangements before having clear evidence that house prices have stopped falling. Instead, Mr Lamont may draw inspiration from the recent sharp fall in inflation to find relatively painless ways of raising revenue. The drop in retail price inflation to 1.7 per cent last month is genuinely good news. Some economists believe that the annual rise in the 'headline' retail prices index could fall to 1.3 per cent this spring, or half December's 2.6 per cent rate of inflation which will be used as the basis for indexing tax allowances and thresholds in the Budget. Such a drop might justify freezing some or all of the tax allowances which apply before Britain's 20, 25 and 40 per cent income tax rates take effect. If Mr Lamont kept all income tax allowances frozen at 1992-93 levels he would save Pounds 750m in 1993-94. Low inflation may also give the chancellor some leeway to widen the value-added tax net, although he must take care that the resulting upward pressure on prices does not breach the upper limit of the 1 per cent to 4 per cent target range for underlying inflation. Britain and Ireland are the only European Community members which zero rate VAT to any extent: in Britain's case zero rating applies to about 24 per cent of consumer spending. It would be both politically inept and socially unjust in a recession to impose VAT on food, where zero rating rather than levying the 17.5 per cent standard VAT rate costs the exchequer Pounds 7bn a year. But there are other areas where the case for zero rating or VAT exemption is less clear. Exempting private education and finance and insurance from VAT respectively cost the government Pounds 600m and Pounds 2.7bn a year compared with the standard VAT rate. Zero rating international passenger transport leads to a revenue loss of Pounds 800m. The exchequer loses Pounds 1.1bn through zero rating books, newspapers, magazines; Pounds 700m on water and sewerage services and Pounds 500m on ships and aircraft. Domestic passenger transport (cost Pounds 1.1bn) or domestic fuel and power (cost Pounds 2.6bn) are also zero rated. Nobody is suggesting that Mr Lamont is contemplating swingeing tax increases in the forthcoming Budget. Indeed his Budget judgment will be very finely balanced. But the examples of zero-rated VAT and VAT exemptions give an indication of areas where the government might over time bolster its finances, perhaps by introducing a lower rate VAT in line with continental practice. As he settles down to weigh the evidence before making his strategic decisions for the Budget, the chancellor may reflect on events across the Atlantic, where President Bill Clinton this week won strong initial support for his package of tax increases and spending cuts to reduce the US budget deficit. Although Mr Lamont believes in a low taxation economy, he also knows that the continued high deficits in the US and Italy over the past decade have done nothing to improve the economic performance of those countries. Their experience is a strong argument for starting to correct the UK's budget deficit next month.</p>

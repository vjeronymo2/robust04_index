			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / International Company News: C&amp;W considers taking stake in Telecom Eireann CABLE and Wireless is exploring the possibility of taking a stake in Telecom Eireann, the Irish state-owned telecommunications company, as part of its strategy to strengthen its position in Europe. C&amp;W said yesterday that discussions were in progress at a senior level between the UK telecommunications group and the Irish government which could lead to a strategic alliance or a joint venture. C&amp;W was not prepared yesterday to give further details of the discussion now in progress, which it said were at an early stage. No indication was given of how large a shareholding was under consideration. Telecom Eireann is the Republic of Ireland's most profitable public sector company. It made a pre-tax profit of IPounds 94m (Pounds 85.5m) in the year to end-April 1992 on revenues of IPounds 782m. With 1m customers and 13,500 staff its value has been estimated at IPounds 1bn were it to be privatised. The possibility of a UK group taking a stake in the company is likely to ruffle Irish sensibilities. Last year the prime minister Mr Albert Reynolds, then finance minister, caused a storm of protest when he indicated that part of TE could be up for sale. TE is overmanned, is carrying a heavy debt burden and has need of technological and financial support to carry through an ambitious development programme. C&amp;W, which dominates the Hong Kong telecommunications market, has a presence in some 50 countries through a series of alliances with local operators.</p>

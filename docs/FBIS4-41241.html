			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Belarusian Prime Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich </F> by correspondents at BTK Television studio in Minsk; questioners  identified by caption -- live]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [Valeriy Drazdow, Minsk  NARODNAYA GAZETA] What prevented Prime Minister Kebich from  conducting the kind of policy he promised to conduct after his  election?    [Kebich] Can you imagine entering your house and seeing that  everything has been stolen? What would be the first reaction of  any man? How to go on living? Where to find money? This is  roughly what happened here. We had a union and good close ties.  We did not have to think how to sell our products or from where  to get raw materials -- everything worked perfectly. Then, we  tore this union apart and found ourselves in a ransacked house.  How could I resolve all these issues in these times of trouble?  Every year I spent some four months in parliament arguing with  lawmakers. You remember that as soon as I would enter the  session hall, the issue of confidence in the government would be  brought up; then lawmakers would demand a report on how we  planned to overcome the crisis. It went on every minute of  every day. Thus, it happened that we were in opposition to one  another -- the Executive and Legislative Branches. We still do  not have the vertical structure of executive power and the  government cannot influence many processes in the Republic.  That is why the president, who will have much greater powers,  will be able to expeditiously implement his decisions and form  that vertical structure. We need tough laws and their rapid  implementation. [passage omitted]    [Mikalay Shcherbachenya, Minsk RESPUBLIKA] The future of the  society which you are going to build is primarily based on  economic and political union with Russia. If you fail to form  such a union, have you considered any other options?    [Kebich] The building of the future society is not my idea  alone -- we are building it and this is written in our  Constitution. With regard to your question about union with  Russia and possible options, I would be a weak politician if I  burnt all my bridges behind me. There are other options, but I  do not want to speak about them at this point. However I am  positive and consider this the goal of the rest of my life to  join our interests not only with Russia, but with Ukraine as  well. If we agree to consider today as the starting point, I am  sure that the union will definitely be formed within a year.  [passage omitted]    [Drazdow, NARODNAYA GAZETA] Russia itself, however, is  speeding toward an abyss -- plants are closing down, chaos,  inflation...[pauses] What is the sense of such unification?    [Kebich] We are uniting our economies and not gangsterism,  chaos, or bankrupt enterprises. On the contrary, we are getting  access to good contacts. Russia's first deputy defense minister  visited us some time long ago. He promised that Russia will  provide contacts for all military enterprises. We will only  take good things from Russia and leave all the bad things behind.    [Uladzimir Lehankow, Minsk BELARUSSKAYA NIVA] Speaking about  economic and monetary union -- discussions are being held over  its fifth article. Has there been any progress in this  direction?    [Kebich] I declare that the fifth article will be amended  and we will not tangle with the Constitution. President Yeltsin  has promised that the Belarusian Bank will enjoy all the rights  of a national bank. That is why the fifth article will be  amended. [passage omitted]    [Unidentified reporter] What economic program do you  suggest, being an outstanding economist and experienced  politician. Will the Republic overcome the crisis by the end of  1994?    [Kebich] There is a candidate who proposes a program worth  two years of U.S. budgets, another one promises that as soon as  he comes to power he will give each citizen $150. The closer  the elections, the more generous the promises. However, I want  to ask him: Where did he get those dollars? Was it a gift from  someone? If it was a gift, what promises did he make to receive  it? He does not have this money! That is why I want to say  that by the end of 1994 we would like to stop the economic slump  and improve the situation in 1995. That is why I want to say  overtly and honestly: Do not believe those who promise you pie  in the sky.    [Reporter] How are you going to fight inflation?    [Kebich] We cannot allow high unemployment. That is why to  stabilize the situation we probably should not reduce inflation  to 7 percent. We must curb it, and we have substantially curbed  it. Everything should be done within reasonable limits. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Peace process is losing credibility says Arafat Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, said yesterday he was astonished at Thursday's statement by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, that there were no sacred dates for implementing the outline peace accord signed on September 13. 'I am astonished and very sorry to hear him say that. It is now nearly six months since the agreement was reached in Oslo and five months since the signing in Washington. Nothing has yet been implemented. What has been signed on September 13 must be adhered to by both sides. It is very important that we should quickly recover the credibility of the peace process,' said Mr Arafat. The PLO leader, interviewed at his headquarters in Tunis, also took issue with Mr Rabin about the time needed to complete the present round of negotiations, which has already been delayed well beyond the scheduled date of December 13. He said that only 'some small items' needed to be finalised by two committees meeting next week in Egypt and Paris. Aides of Mr Arafat had been alarmed by Mr Rabin's statement that, despite the successful conclusion of an agreement on the most important outstanding issues in Cairo this week, at least another month might be required to finish the negotiations over Israel's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho in the West Bank. 'The major problems have been resolved,' said Mr Arafat. He added that his negotiations this week in Cairo with Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, had not been easy but they had eventually made the necessary compromises. 'In my opinion if we continue working with the same attitude then no more than two to three weeks is needed to sign the final agreement,' he added. Other PLO leaders in Tunis are becoming increasingly sceptical about Mr Rabin's willingness to implement the Washington accord and complained that new issues were constantly being raised in order to delay agreement. They also sensed that Israeli army commanders were exerting greater influence and feared that without external pressure from the US and members of the European Union the start of Israel's withdrawal could be put off for several more months. Mr Arafat said yesterday that it was not his credibility that was at stake, but that of the peace process. He also brushed aside criticism from Palestinians in the occupied territories that he was abusing his authority and failing to consult others. 'Such criticism is part of our democracy. I am not leading a herd of sheep, but people who are freedom fighters,' he said. 'This criticism is proof that we have democracy. They have the right to voice their opinions. And the fact that they are saying these things shows that they wish to be fully involved in the peace process, not that they are against it.'</p>

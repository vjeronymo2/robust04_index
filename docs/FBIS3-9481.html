			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hamid Deronjic and Nihad Culihovic] </F>   [Excerpt] The shelling of the central section of the Brcko  defense, which has been pounded with tanks and 120-mm mortars  since 0630, has in the meantime been stepped up with fire from  122-mm howitzers, mortars of [word indistinct] and 82-mm, [word  indistinct] and recoilless guns. Chetnik antiaircraft guns,  brownings, portable mortars, and snipers are attacking almost  all parts of our defense. There have been no infantry attacks  yet, which clearly indicates what the real aim of the Serbian  aggressor is, namely to destroy as much as it can and to kill as  many people as possible on the free territory.

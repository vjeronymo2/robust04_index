			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Arts: The Mill is not on the Floss - Theatre George Eliot (1819-1880) confided to a friend in 1860: 'the Mill is not even on the Floss.' By the same token, at the Oxford Playhouse, the Shared Experience touring production of The Mill on the Floss is nowhere near Eliot. But it is no less enjoyable for that, and makes a laudable attempt at a difficult task. The play starts with Maggie Tulliver reading about witches and drowning. This sets the tone for Maggie's unconventional life and watery death. Then follows the familiar story of the fall of the house of Tulliver, the death of Maggie's father, her venal aunts and uncles, her love for the son of the man who ruined her family, and her passionate affair with her cousin's fiancee. And a river runs through it. Eliot works on the page and on film but not on stage because she needs a fixed point of view - one narrator or one camera. The theatre has too many possibilities. Shared Experience solved the technical problems better in their recent Anna Karenina and A Handful of Dust by giving the actors some of the narrative, allowing them to introduce each other. But here, the first half is a jumbled sequence of events which would be hard to follow without some Eliot pre-history. The second half works better because the characters are known. Eliot was more interested in abstracts than this production allows. She was a Victorian agony aunt, having her characters speak truths about their situation and ours: 'Being unhappy can become a bad habit.' Eliot's world is all duties, ties and promises, the invisible bonds that make a community. And that way of seeing life works better in print than on stage. However, the production brilliantly has three Maggies: rebellious child, pious young woman and passionate, sensitive adult making a prime time Freudian tripartite personality. She would be a cert for Oprah Winfrey: 'And what was the child in you telling you to do at that time?' Shirley Henderson (young Maggie) is a fine actor; she brings poise, passion and just enough idiosyncrasy to the part. Around her, Simeon Andrews as her father and Ian Puleston-Davies as the brother who grows into him are both solid; Helen Schlesinger as the adult Maggie is a riot of indecision. She gives the lie to anyone who thinks Eliot cannot be presented sexily. Elsewhere the acting is surer than the slippy regional accents, which will hamper the proposed European tour. The set is commendably succinct  - a stripped-out mill interior with ropes and grain sacks; and the costumes are a delight, especially when Maggie casts off the penitential blue serge and steps into a wicked black lace evening gown for a fateful charity ball. Nancy Meckler and Polly Teale direct Helen Edmundson's adaptation. They have taken on a difficult task, and have done better work with other adaptations. But that is George Eliot's fault. On tour to Cardiff (April 19-23, 0222 230451); Bath (April 26-30, 0225 448844); Brighton (May 3-7, 0273 328488); and London, Tricycle Theatre (May 11 - June 11, 071 328 1000).</p>

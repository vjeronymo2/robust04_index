			<p>CSO     [Text] Toshiba Corporation (President, Fumio Sato) and  Professor Masao Toyoda of Osaka University have jointly  developed a thermal stress analysis system for multi-layered  coating materials such as functionally gradient materials. Up to  now, decisions on selection and thickness of coating materials  for gas turbines were largely left up to experts' experience.  The gas turbines were coated with highly resistant materials  against severe environmental conditions. The new development has  made it possible to assess proper thickness and stress by  specifying materials and the condition under which the materials  are being used. It now will be possible to design coatings to  prevent thermal stress quantitatively, a serious problem in the  past.    The equipment used in high performance gas turbines, fast  breeder reactors, and nuclear fusion reactors are coated with  highly durable materials to enable them to stand up under high  temperatures. The newly developed system is automatically able  to analyze thermal stress and residual stress of functionally  gradient materials with Toshiba's notebook personal computers.  The thermal stress analysis software uses a steady thermal  stress analysis routine based on steady heat conduction analysis  and the strain control method. This enables easy analysis of  thermal stress and residual stress in layered composite  materials such as FGM. A database in the computer contains  material constants for various kinds of heat resistant materials  and severe environment resistant coating materials which  Professor Toyoda and his group at Osaka University have  developed. The new system develops new data of actual gradient  coatings using this database. Once the type of FGM to be used is  decided, the properties of intermediate compositions of FGMs can  be calculated automatically by specifying the number of layers,  surface materials, and bonding materials which will be used.  Stress distribution within the FGM at particular temperatures  can be calculated easily when temperature conditions are entered.    The conventional finit element method calculated the  properties of films incrementally. This required use of large  computers. But the new system solves the problem through  analysis of models based on strain control theory, calculations  that can be done using personal computers. As a result, in  addition to continuous solutions, all solutions of boundaries  which had previously delayed thermal stress analysis of coating  materials such as FGM, can be obtained. The finit element method  provided only discontinuous solutions.    For now, Toshiba plans to use the newly developed system for  designing severe environment resistant coating materials  in-house in their energy-related research programs.</p>

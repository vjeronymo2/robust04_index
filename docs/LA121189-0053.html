			<p><P> December 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> S. AFRICA BLACKS ASK WHITES' AID IN REFORM BID  </P> <P> Concluding the largest anti-apartheid conference inside South Africa in 34  years, black leaders Sunday invited South African whites to join them in an  intensified campaign of civil disobedience to pressure President Frederik W. de  Klerk to move more swiftly to dismantle apartheid and open negotiations with  the black majority.  </P> <P> The 4,662 black, white, mixed-race and Indian delegates, in resolutions adopted  late Saturday at a closed session, declared De Klerk's reform initiatives  "devoid of any substance. There have been no actions to back up his vague  promises."  </P> <P> "We want to end apartheid and exploitation as soon as possible," the delegates  said in a statement issued Sunday. "If De Klerk can convince us that he is  serious about genuine negotiations, . . . we are ready to talk about the  creation of a democratic South Africa."  </P> <P> Although the Conference for a Democratic Future brought together  representatives of more than 2,100 organizations, several major black  organizations either boycotted the meeting or were not invited.  </P> <P> Among them was the left-wing Pan-Africanist Movement, an ideological twin of  the outlawed Pan-Africanist Congress which opposes the African National  Congress' philosophy of non-racism. Also excluded was the Inkatha movement,  headed by the moderate Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, who opposes the  ANC's guerrilla tactics as too militant.  </P> <P> Murphy Morobe, a spokesman for the conference, acknowledged that black unity  remains elusive, but he said that "a firm basis was established for the  political direction of all anti-apartheid forces well into the 1990s." He  described the 1990s as "the decade of the final onslaught against apartheid."  </P> <P> The resolutions solidified the well-known position of mainstream anti-apartheid  groups, led by the outlawed ANC and the like-minded Mass Democratic Movement.  Those organizations have demanded that De Klerk dismantle racial segregation  laws, release all political prisoners, lift the state of emergency and allow  free political activity before negotiations can begin.  </P> <P> "We are convinced that the De Klerk government is not interested in creating a  democratic South Africa, nor is it interested in genuine negotiations," one  resolution said. "Clearly, De Klerk is buying time to re-order the forces of  minority domination and win over some of our people to his fraudulent schemes."  </P> <P> Since taking power in September, De Klerk has pledged to create a climate for  negotiations for "a new South Africa," in which the 5 million whites will share  power with the 26 million blacks.  </P> <P> In a series of conciliatory moves, De Klerk has released several prominent  political prisoners, opened the country's few remaining whites-only beaches,  promised to do away with a law that empowers local municipalities to deny  blacks access to public facilities, allowed dozens of protest marches through  city streets and brought the nearly autonomous power of the security  establishment under direct Cabinet control.  </P> <P> The one-day conference adopted a resolution demanding multiracial elections for  an assembly that would draft a constitution establishing a one-person, one-vote  system. De Klerk has rejected that concept, offering instead to negotiate a  constitution that would extend limited political rights to the black majority.  He wants to select negotiators for those talks in segregated elections.  </P> <P> Another resolution urged whites to "break with apartheid," stage solidarity  marches into black townships and campaign to create new municipalities by  merging white cities and their adjoining black townships.  </P> <P> The conference also urged black labor unions to escalate their confrontational  activities, suggesting that they occupy the Johannesburg Stock Exchange if  necessary to prevent privatization of major state enterprises.  </P> <P> "We call upon our people to reject capitalism and (the) free market system," a  resolution on economics said.  </P> <P> Other resolutions urged parents and students to defy school segregation  policies, demanded land redistribution and urged young white men to refuse  mandatory military service.  </P> <P> The meeting was one of the largest anti-apartheid gatherings inside South  Africa since 1955.  </P></p>

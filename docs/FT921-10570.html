			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont faces pressure over tax - Financial Times Poll of Conservative MPs IF Mr Norman Lamont had any remaining doubts about what he should aim for in his March 10 Budget, they will have been dispelled by the latest survey of Conservative opinion at Westminster. The FT's questionnaire was completed by 107 Tory MPs, representing 30 per cent of the 367-strong parliamentary party and well over a third of backbench MPs. By a margin of more than three to one, government supporters believe the chancellor should use what the Treasury insists is his strictly limited room for manoeuvre to reduce income tax rather than to raise public spending. The 71 per cent in favour of tax cuts compared with 19 per cent who indicated that they would prefer any boost to the economy to come through higher public spending. The remaining 10 per cent said that there was not a direct choice, with most urging Mr Lamont to do both. The results confirm that the priority of Tory MPs is high-profile action to demonstrate in the weeks before the general election that the government is determined to get the economy moving. Tax cuts are seen as the best way to underline the essential difference between the Conservatives and Labour during an election campaign which, if Mr John Major opts for April 9, might start within two days of the Budget speech. The MPs appear less sure whether Mr Lamont should opt to raise income tax thresholds by more than the rate of inflation or cut the basic rate. But the 9-percentage-point majority in favour of the former is significantly smaller than in previous years, suggesting that a basic-rate reduction would win strong support from the backbenches. There is also strong support for measures to boost investment incentives for industry, with more than 70 per cent of those polled pressing for them. By contrast, the MPs are relatively evenly divided over whether Mr Lamont should take special action to help the motor industry or to alleviate the effects of increases in the uniform business rate. In spite of the brickbats thrown at the chancellor by sections of media  - and by some Tory MPs - the survey shows that most in the party are reluctant to blame him for a recession which remains the main obstacle to a fourth consecutive election victory. A handful added disparaging comments about the chancellor to their questionnaires - 'It would be disloyal to be frank', wrote one. But 60 per cent rated his performance excellent or good and only 6 per cent disappointing. In spite of the constraint it imposes on interest rates, there is general support for sterling's participation in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. Nearly 30 per cent say it is 'vital' to maintain the pound's present parity. There are, however, small minorities on both the right and left of the party who believe that the ERM is an obstacle to economic recovery. Some 20 per cent describe the parity as 'unimportant'. A significant proportion of those said that Mr Lamont should be ready to withdraw sterling from the system. Overall, Conservative MPs are more equivocal in their commitment to the present rate against the D-Mark should that threaten a rise in British interest rates. Only a small majority think Mr Lamont should go as far as a rise in borrowing costs to defend the pound. Among other changes sought from the back benches, there are strong minorities in favour of an extension of tax relief for child care and reductions in or abolition of inheritance tax, stamp duties and capital gains taxes. There are also more eclectic requests. One respondent believes that all household staff should attract tax relief for their employers, while a colleague said that Mr Lamont's first priority on March 10 should be 'helping industry to get off its knees'. Another replied frankly that Mr Lamont's task was to ensure 'the survival of the government'. But if MPs are worried, few are willing to admit it.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------             WHAT TORY MPS WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN THE BUDGET  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Results shown in rounded percentages.

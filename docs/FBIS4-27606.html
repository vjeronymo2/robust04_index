			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 31 (YONHAP) -- South Korea's exports of  technology to foreign countries numbered 105 cases last year, a  rise of 31.3 percent over 1992, and the money they fetched  totaled 45,103,000 dollars, up 38.8 percent.    A Science and Technology Ministry official said on Tuesday  the ratio of the country's technology exports to imports gained  a little but it was still meager, 4.8 percent, last year. By  region, technology transfer to Southeast Asian countries  accounted for 91 percent of the total or 96 cases, of which 51  cases or 48.6 percent of the total went to China. But, the 51  cases transferred to China were worth only 10,295,000 dollars or  22.8 percent of the total technology exports money in 1992. The  official said most of the technology exported to China were low  value-added and simple knowhow such as the ones on assemblage,  processing and garment making.    Meanwhile, the ministry has authorized the Korea Industrial  Technology Promotion Association to handle on its behalf paper  work on technology exports by private industries effective June  1 in an effort to reduce technology-exporting industries' burden.</p>

			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Way clear for big energy plan The ground has been laid for a massive investment programme in east Germany's energy sector after the Treuhand privatisation agency yesterday completed the sale of the region's electricity sector and the biggest brown coalfields. After four years of negotiations, the Treuhand sold Veag, the former east German electricity monopoly, to a west German energy consortium led by RWE Energie, the country's largest utility, and which includes Bayernwerk and Preussen-Elektra. At the same time, the agency sold Laubag, the giant coalfields which straddle the eastern state of Brandenburg to a consortium headed by Rheinbraun, the brown coal subsidiary of RWE. Laubag will supply Veag with brown coal. Under the terms of the agreement, the RWE consortium will pay DM8bn (Pounds 3.3bn) for Veag and invest DM23.3bn (Pounds 9.7bn) until 2012 during which time it will reduce the workforce from 12,700 to 6,700. The investments will be targeted on upgrading power stations, introducing strict environmental controls, and building six 800MW power plants in eastern Germany. The Rheinbraun consortium, which paid DM2.1bn for the Laubag fields, has agreed to invest DM6bn until 2015, reducing in the meantime the current workforce from 12,000 to 8,000. Annual brown coal production will range between 50m and 55m tonnes. The two contracts, signed just weeks before the federal elections, and five days before the state elections in Brandenburg and Saxony, mean that the brown coal industry in eastern Germany will be saved. However, the privatisation of Veag had provoked a bitter dispute between east Germany's cities which had opposed the sale to the west German utilities on grounds that it would create a monopolistic structure in the region's energy sector. The Stromvertrag, or electricity contract of August 1990 between the two former East and West German governments, stipulated that the regional utilities in the east would have to buy 70 per cent of their power from Veag over the next 20 years. Despite EU arguments that this would extend west Germany's monopolistic energy structure to the east, Bonn was determined to implement the Stromvertrag to secure a future for brown coal. However, the collapse of east Germany's manufacturing base has already led to a fall in brown coal's share of the primary energy market from 62 per cent in 1989 to about 40 per cent, while natural gas, which enjoyed only a 10 per cent share is expected to increase to about 23 per cent by the end of this decade. German undercover police have been offered illegal plutonium in what could be the fifth case of nuclear smuggling in as many months, Bavarian authorities said yesterday, Reuter reports from Munich. A state interior ministry spokeswoman in Bavaria, where police seized illegal plutonium at Munich airport last month, declined to give details.</p>

			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Private View: A mother rattles the prison bars MARILYN BROWN'S life changed when her son was arrested in Goa. For one thing, the bustling Tory party activist decided to stand against her own Member of Parliament in this month's British general election. She polled 119 votes; the official Conservative candidate, Douglas Hurd, Foreign Secretary, retained his Oxfordshire seat with 36,256. But the point was made. Marilyn Brown accuses the Foreign Office of 'disgraceful' failure to support British citizens arrested in other lands. Her verdict is the result of the 16 months her son Nicholas has spent in Reis Magos jail in Panaji, capital of the former Portuguese enclave on India's western coast. 'This is totally beyond any experience I have had in my life before,' she told me this week. 'I didn't know who to turn to, who to talk to. The Foreign Office and Douglas Hurd were the obvious experts. Within six months I began to suspect that their advice was more for the benefit of the Foreign Office than for the benefit of my son.' Mrs Brown conducts her campaign from a modernised cottage, now for sale, in a hamlet so small it does not even merit road signs. The house is full of cats and there are chickens and donkeys in the garden. Divorced from Nicholas' father, whom she married at 18, she lives with David Brookes, now her partner in a domestic heating business. She was always a Conservative. She laughed ironically. 'My ideas have been challenged somewhat. I would still regard myself basically as a Conservative but I am beginning to wonder if I really am.' She has had more support than criticism for her act of political betrayal. 'That doesn't surprise me. I always felt that the people I mixed with were nice people first and committed Conservatives second.' Her son Nicholas, now 28, also worked for the business until he set off to see the world after a broken love affair. He settled in India for two years. Riding a friend's motorcycle through Goa in December, 1990, he was stopped by the police. He claims they planted half an ounce of cannabis on him in order to extort a bribe. Since India, with western encouragement, strengthened its drug laws the minimum sentence for possession of this quantity of cannabis is 10 years. Nicholas' trial began last July and has dragged on intermittently ever since. Goa was once a hippy paradise. Today it is an enforcers' paradise. There are several dozen young foreigners languishing in jail. Nicholas Brown's case sounded familiar to me. Six months before his arrest I was stopped, like him, while riding a borrowed motorcycle through the outskirts of Panaji. I refused the three policemen's demand for money, threatened them with the name of my newspaper and was let go. Following Press stories on the Brown case, India's High Commission in London has hinted at further charges against him: holding a forged passport is one. Mrs Brown dismissed them as a concoction. I asked her whether publicity was not counter-productive. 'The Foreign Office advice is don't rock the boat. If you do, they say, the prisoner will suffer. So most families spend months and perhaps years clinging pathetically to the hope that behind the scenes the Foreign Office is watching over their interests. Most of us eventually come to the conclusion that the prisoner is being just left to take his chance.' What exactly is your complaint? I asked her. 'My main complaint is that they totally abandon their own citizens in these sorts of situations. They will take in books and cigarettes and what-have-you as long as the prisoner has funds to pay for them. But if the family and the prisoner don't have money, there is no money. 'They find these sort of cases very embarrassing. Not every prisoner in a foreign jail is an innocent by any manner of means. A lot of them have been very foolish. Some of them, you know, are quite bad characters and are probably guilty of quite serious crimes. It's very easy to regard these people as a nuisance. 'Douglas Hurd is on record many times as saying 'Don't interfere in the judicial process of foreign countries.' Unfortunately, he's missing the whole point. We're not asking him to interfere. What we're asking is for the Foreign Office to make it very clear that British citizens, whatever trouble they're in, are people of value and worth and the Government is standing behind them. They don't actually need to do a great deal in most cases.' But, I said, aren't you asking for much more than moral support. You want Her Britannic Majesty's Government to crack the whip and demand special treatment. 'No. Their negative attitude means countries realise that however slow or unfair a trial may be, however great the injustice, the British Government isn't going to make a fuss about it. If that comes across so clearly to us and other families, it sure as eggs comes across just as clearly to foreign governments.' But with today's mass travel isn't the attitude of the Foreign Office understandable? If you go to these places you take a risk. 'If they said that loud and clear it might be understandable. But they don't. If you were to stop 100 people on the street and ask them what would happen if they went to Thailand, or Goa or South America and got into trouble, most of them would say the Foreign Office would pull out all the stops to make sure they were treated justly.' Mrs Brown thinks the diplomatic career structure is at fault. The 'high-flyers with wonderful degrees' did not have the relevant experience, she said. The consular service was 'very much third division. A lot of the staff try their best. But if a person in post doesn't want to stir himself, there's no incentive to do so. 'I'm not very articulate and I'm not an original thinker. So you have to forgive me if I talk in cliches. But consular affairs is the Cinderella service.' She praised Douglas Hurd for giving Britain a high profile abroad. 'He goes round shaking hands with all the world leaders, establishing on the whole excellent relations. Now what's the point of that if it's not to benefit Britain and its citizens? I know trade is a big issue, but there are others.' 'I'm not in the business of getting guilty people off the hook. I am fighting for guilty and innocent alike: everybody has the right to a fair trial. We can't fight for everybody. We can fight for our own citizens.' You are suggesting that British subjects should get British treatment wherever they go in the world. That is not achievable. 'No. But that doesn't stop us trying to achieve it, surely. Otherwise nothing's going to change. The British Government is marvellous about human rights for Kurds, Chinese dissidents, the 'disappeared' in South America, and I would cheer them every inch of the way on that. But if they can speak out for foreign victims of injustice why are they so reluctant to speak out for their own people?' Are you quite sure your son is innocent? 'I'm sure, yes, absolutely. But in a way it doesn't really matter whether he's innocent or guilty. When you look at the charges against him and the others they are so minor that, quite honestly, the way the cases are being handled is diabolical.' Mrs Brown has been adopted by a recently-created lobby, Fair Trials Abroad. Her demands are for extension of means-tested legal aid to Britons abroad, surveillance to identify difficult cases, and independent legal evaluation of trial transcripts where miscarriages occur. Although in the dark about her son's prospects, Mrs Brown thinks he is one of the luckier ones. She has had 'desperate' letters from other prisoners and other families and is sending her own money to the worst off. I asked her whether campaigning had made her own troubles easier to bear. 'No, it's made it worse, actually because now I'm in touch with other cases, most of them much worse than Nicholas's. I'm very worried and frightened because all these cases have got to be taken up.' It may sound cruel to ask, but has this given you a purpose in life you didn't feel before? 'Well, yes it has. I'm quailing because I didn't want to be involved in anything so devastating. But I am a Christian and I've really run up against the buffers with this. I've spent all my adult life quite merrily talking about how being a Christian is a challenge, etcetera, etcetera. For me so far, I realise, it hasn't been particularly challenging. 'Now it looks as if I have suddenly been presented with a path to my life that I could never have foreseen. I just cannot turn aside from it, which is quite frightening.' Have you discovered yourself to be stronger than you imagined.? 'Yes, in some ways. But an awful lot weaker in others. I have found that I have a lot more determination, more - what shall I say?  - resourcefulness than I'd ever have thought. 'It is changing my life. I'm amazed that I'm so committed to this. I would have thought I would be the sort of person to find a way of shuffling it on to someone else. I'm amazed how determined I am not to do that. 'I wouldn't have thought I am the stuff that campaigners and martyrs are made of. But an area of real, human misery has been revealed and I just cannot turn away from it. 'I just hope and pray the Foreign Office is going to do the decent thing and start wading in there, because I don't relish the thought of fighting like this for the rest of my life.' So I rang the Foreign Office. A spokesman said no new guidance had been issued to embassies or consulates.</p>

			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Rover to boost parts purchasing Rover Group, the leading UK carmaker, is to increase the value of its components purchases by Pounds 500m or 18 per cent next year to Pounds 3.25bn, Mr John Towers, chief executive, said yesterday. The group, a subsidiary of BMW of Germany, is expected to raise production significantly next year as a result of rising sales and several new model launches. UK suppliers will benefit most, as they account for about 80 per cent of Rover's components purchases, which will total Pounds 2.75bn this year. Last month the company said it was creating 1,450 jobs at its British plants in response to rising sales, in particular in export markets. Next year it will launch replacements for its 200/400 range as well as a new range of MG sportscars as part of its five-year, Pounds 1.5bn investment programme. Rover increased production 16 per cent in the first nine months this year to 355,860 from 306,198 in the same period a year ago. Output for the full year is expected to rise to about 492,000 from 430,200 last year. Mr Towers forecast recently that production would rise significantly above 500,000 next year. Rover is continuing to rationalise its supplier base. It has already reduced the number from about 2,000 in 1989 to 700. About 360 core suppliers account for 75 per cent of Rover's purchases. The company said yesterday that it was seeking to reduce the number of its suppliers to 360 in the next three years.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------            UK NEW CAR REGISTRATIONS -

			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FAN PLEADS NO CONTEST TO BITING REFEREE  </P> <P> A Los Angeles man pleaded no contest Thursday to biting off part of a referee's  ear after a soccer game at Balboa Park.  </P> <P> Encarnacion Celestino Cifuentes, 39, was charged with mayhem in the July 17,  1988, biting of Santos Gonzales, 41, of Hollywood.  </P> <P> Mayhem is defined by the state penal code as the malicious disfigurement or  dismemberment of another person.  </P> <P> It carries a maximum sentence of six years in prison, but in exchange for  Cifuentes' no-contest plea, prosecutors agreed to seek no more than four years.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Lloyd M. Nash said he will probably seek a prison term for  Cifuentes but would not be more specific. Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Alan B.  Haber scheduled sentencing for Jan. 26.  </P> <P> Cifuentes' attorney, Deputy Public Defender Daniel Alan Kuperberg, told Haber  that his client is innocent but did not want to risk a more severe sentence if  he were to be convicted at a trial.  </P> <P> During the game between players of Salvadoran descent and players of Guatemalan  descent, Cifuentes, a spectator, disputed a call Gonzales had made against the  Guatemalan team, Nash said.  </P> <P> After the match, Cifuentes grabbed Gonzales from behind and bit off about half  an inch of his ear, Nash said.  </P> <P> A no-contest plea is treated the same as a guilty plea by California criminal  courts.  </P></p>

			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Passengers to be compensated Cunard said yesterday that passengers unable to travel on the QE2's Christmas cruise could take two cruises next year, should they want to, Neil Buckley writes. The 490 passengers were offered a full refund by Christmas, plus a free transatlantic cruise of equivalent value next year with Pounds 250 spending money. They could combine the free offer with their refund to upgrade their tickets next year, or even take two trips. Meanwhile, 158 passengers who were to have flown to New York to join the ship for a Caribbean cruise have been told not to go because their cabins will not be ready in time. Cunard said the bad weather had prevented sub-contractors from working. Cunard could not give a figure for the likely total cost of compensation, but said a mooted Pounds 2.5m was 'the product of someone's imagination'. But with tickets for the transatlantic crossing ranging from Pounds 595 to Pounds 5,000, the cost of refunds plus free tickets for 490 will be considerable. Cunard may face further complaints from some of the 600 passengers on board the liner. About 50 passengers were reported to have formed an action group.</p>

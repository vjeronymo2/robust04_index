At a leaders' summit that ended in Pretoria  a short while ago, the alliance said any further initiative to  break the deadlock in negotiations would have to come from the  ANC. [passage omitted] We have a report from Gary Alfonso in  Pretoria:    Freedom Alliance negotiators arrived for the summit to  report  back to their leaders about last night's deadlock. After a  two-hour meeting, the writing was on the wall. Alliance  Chairman Rowan Cronje said that their group could not and would  not make any more concessions. IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]  leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi said his party would not feel  threatened by the looming deadline for parties to register for  the election. That means if no compromise is reached on the  issue of entrenching powers for regions in the constitution, the  Alliance parties will not register, and that means that they  will not take part in the election. The Alliance members say  the ball, and their continued participation, is now in the hands  of the ANC and the government.</p>

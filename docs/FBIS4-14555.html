			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Tamara Zamyatina and </F> Anna Melnikova]    [Text] Moscow, 31 Mar -- "Those who are constructing a  scenario for Boris Yeltsin to leave the political scene in 1996  are disassociating themselves from the mood in society to ask  the president to put forward his candidacy in the coming  elections." This was the opinion expressed by the head of  state's press secretary, Vyacheslav Kostikov, at today's  briefing in the Kremlin.    Asked about the possibility of Rutskoy or Zhirinovskiy  coming  to power, Vyacheslav Kostikov remarked on "the amorality of such  an alternative" to the president in office. Furthermore, he  stressed, "the very thought of their coming to power lowers the  hurdles of political morals in Russia because people with the  mentality of hooligans and foul-mouths should not become  presidents of a great power." The head of state's press  secretary expressed regret at the fact that militant appeals  made recently and being made today by the persons mentioned  seemed to pass by those set on seeing Rutskoy or Zhirinovskiy  become president.</p>

			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Democrats seek probe over Iraq support A GROUP of influential Democratic members of the US Congress is seeking the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate possible wrongdoing by the Bush administration in its support of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, before his August 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The House of Representatives judiciary committee said yesterday it planned to hold a hearing on whether to name an independent counsel. This follows allegations by Mr Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the House banking committee, and others in Congress, that the administration is trying to cover up its misuse of government loan guarantees that Iraq had obtained for agricultural purchases, but then used to acquire military goods and technology. At the core of the matter is an alleged abuse of loan guarantees for supposed agricultural exports to Iraq that were financed by the branch in Atlanta of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL). The BNL affair is beginning to attract widespread attention in the US media, with the approach of the trial of Mr Christopher Drogoul, former BNL Atlanta manager accused of making more than Dollars 4bn of improper loans to Iraq from his branch. The trial, due to begin on June 2, was yesterday postponed to June 22. Documents obtained by the Financial Times show that a substantial part of these loans helped Iraq's nuclear, chemical and missile projects.</p>

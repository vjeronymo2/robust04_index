			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Example: A hospital with a cost reporting period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beginning July 1 qualified as a referral center effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> July 1, 1992. The hospital has fewer than 275 beds. Its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3-year status as a referral center is protected through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> June 30, 1995 (the end of its cost reporting period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beginning July 1, 1994). To determine if the hospital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should retain its status as a referral center for an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional 3-year period, we will review its compliance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the applicable criteria for its cost reporting periods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beginning July 1, 1992, July 1, 1993, and July 1, 1994. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital must meet the criteria in effect either for its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost reporting period beginning July 1, 1995, or for two out  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the three past periods. For example, to be found to have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> met the criteria at &sect;412.96(c) for its cost reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period beginning July 1, 1993, the hospital's case-mix index  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> value during FY 1991 must have equaled or exceeded the lower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the national or the appropriate regional standard as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published in the September 1, 1992 final rule. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital's total number of discharges during its cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting year beginning July 1, 1991, must have equaled or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceeded 5,000 or the regional standard as published in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> September 1, 1992 final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For those hospitals that seek to retain referral center  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> status by meeting the criteria of &sect;412.96(b)(1)(i) and (ii)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (that is, rural location and at least 275 beds), we will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> look at the number of beds shown for indirect medical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> education purposes (as defined at &sect;412.105(b)) on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital's cost report for the appropriate year. We will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider only full cost reporting periods when determining a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital's status under &sect;412.96(b)(1)(ii). This definition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> varies from the number of beds criterion used to determine a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital's initial status as a referral center because we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe it is important for a hospital to demonstrate that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it has maintained at least 275 beds throughout its entire  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost reporting period, not just for a particular portion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Determination of Number of Beds in Determining the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Indirect Medical Education Adjustment (&sect;412.105)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1886(d)(5)(B) of the Act provides that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prospective payment hospitals that have residents in an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved graduate medical education program receive an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional payment to reflect the higher indirect operating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs associated with graduate medical education. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations regarding the calculation of this additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment, known as the indirect medical education (IME)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment, are at &sect;412.105. The additional payment is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculated by multiplying a hospital's DRG revenue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (including outlier payments) by the applicable IME  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment factor. The adjustment factor is calculated by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using a hospital's ratio of residents-to-beds in the formula  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> set forth at section 1886(d)(5)(B)(ii) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 412.105(b) states that the number of beds used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the resident-to-bed ratio is calculated by dividing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of days during the cost reporting period into ``the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of available bed days during the cost reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period, not including beds assigned to newborns, custodial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> care, and excluded distinct part hospital units *&blank;*&blank;*.'' Since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we added this language to the regulations in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> September 3, 1985 final rule (50 FR 35679 and 35690), there  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has been some confusion over whether this definition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> includes or excludes bed days attributable to neonatal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intensive care units. This confusion has resulted in some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals contesting their fiscal intermediaries' inclusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of intensive care neonatal intensive care beds in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals' count of available beds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Prior to the adoption of &sect;412.105(b), the definition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of available beds was at section 2510.5A of the Provider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reimbursement Manual_Part 1, which was originally used to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establish bed-size categories for purposes of applying the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost limits under section 1861(v)(1)(A) of the Act. That  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition excluded newborn beds but specifically included  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beds in intensive care units, coronary care units, and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> special care inpatient hospital units. This exclusion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> newborn beds was consistent with the exclusion of newborn  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> days and costs from the determination of Medicare's share of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowable routine service costs (see section 2202.11B of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manual). If a neonatal unit qualifies as an intensive care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unit, however, the costs of that unit are included in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining Medicare's costs (see section 2202.7.II.B of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manual). Correspondingly, the days in a neonatal unit that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualifies as an intensive care unit are counted as intensive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> care type days rather than nursery days (see section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2202.7.II.A of the Manual). Finally, section 2510.5A of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manual clearly indicates that intensive care unit beds and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> special care unit beds are included in a hospital's bed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the September 3, 1985 final rule, we added the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of available beds to the regulations governing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the IME adjustment (then &sect;412.118(b)). The expressed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purpose for the change was to stop counting beds ``based upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the total number of beds available on the first day of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pertinent cost reporting period'' and to begin counting based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on ``the number of available bed days (excluding beds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assigned to newborns, custodial beds, and beds in excluded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units) during the current cost reporting period divided by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the number of days in the cost reporting period'' (50 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 35679). We did not change the definition of available beds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Our current position regarding the treatment of these beds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is unchanged from the time when the cost limits established  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under section 1861(v)(1)(A) of the Act were in effect and is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with the way we treat beds in other hospital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas. That is, if the bed days and costs are allowable in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the calculation of Medicare's share of inpatient costs, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beds within that unit are included as well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some hospitals have asserted that when we excluded beds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assigned to newborns, we changed our treatment of neonatal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intensive care unit beds. However, we note that the term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``newborn'' has historically been used synonymously with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nursery. Perhaps the clearest illustration of this is the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of a ``newborn inpatient day'' as a day that ``an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> infant occupies a newborn bed in the nursery'' (see section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2815 of the Provider Reimbursement Manual_Part 2.) This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition dates back at least to 1975. If &sect;412.105(b) was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indeed meant to change our established policy, we would have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> referenced that intent at the time. This would have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary since neonatal intensive care costs and days were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> still included in the calculation of Medicare's costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, in August 1988, we issued Provider Reimbursement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manual Transmittal No. 345, revising section 2405.3G of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manual, which provides implementing instructions for the IME  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment. As part of this revision, the definition of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of beds was clarified to specifically exclude beds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``*&blank;*&blank;* assigned to newborns which are not in intensive care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas *&blank;*&blank;*.'' Those arguing that &sect;412.105(b) excludes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neonatal intensive care unit beds from the hospital bed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> count also argue that this Manual issuance is contradictory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to clarify our policy, we are proposing to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revise the regulations at &sect;412.105(b) to exclude  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically only beds assigned to newborns in the nursery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, neonatal intensive care beds would not be excluded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the bed count. We would like to stress that this does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not represent a policy change in our bed counting rules, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rather a reaffirmation of our longstanding position.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Revising the wording of the regulations should alleviate any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> future misunderstandings, as well as clarify our position  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding previous application of this policy, both before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and since the original publication of our bed counting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations now specified at &sect;412.105(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are also proposing to make a technical change to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;412.105(d)(1) to correct a reference.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

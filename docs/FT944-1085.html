			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / People: Abbey National Building Society John Fry, who probably knows more about the Abbey National building society than anyone, has been appointed an executive vice chairman. Fry, who joined the Abbey National in 1961, became a general manager in 1979 and joined the board in 1984 several years before the mutually-owned building society turned itself into a bank and floated its shares on the stock market. He is currently managing director, insurance, and will retain responsibility for Abbey National's life and general insurance business.</p>

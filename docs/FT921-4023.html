			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Comment): Industry receives a selective shot in the arm - Charles Leadbeater assesses whether the Budget will help raise British business from the depths of recession For the chief executive of a small business in the car industry facing a huge rates bill, who has a sideline investing in British films, an offshoot making cider and a brother who is a bookmaker, yesterday brought a stream of good news. All these groups of businesses benefitted from Mr Lamont's Budget. But for much of the rest of industry the direct impact was neutral. It will give them little help in emerging from the current recession. It is unlikely that the budget measures designed to benefit all businesses, such as the cut in the uniform business rate, will deliver a significant early boost to capital investment. According to Mr Ron Garrick, chief executive of the Weir Group the Scottish engineering concern, the business rate cut would amount to only 0.25 per cent of his company's costs. The Treasury forecasts that business investment will fall by 2.75 per cent this year after a fall of 11.75 per cent last year. What really matters to business is the impact the budget has upon the political outlook. Most executives agree with the chancellor's assessment that most of the ingredients of recovery from recession are in place in the UK - principally lower inflation, healthier personal finances and lower interest rates. The Treasury forecasts that in the next year, these improving economic indicators will be reflected in company finances. The corporate sector financial deficit, the gap between its savings and its investment, should close to less than 0.25 per cent of GDP this year and disappear altogether next year. The real rate of return industrial companies receive should rise from a trough of about 6 per cent last year to reach 8 per cent next year. But many industrialists believe the recovery which should bring this improvement in corporate finances is being held back by uncertainty among consumers over the timing and outcome of the election. The budget should improve business confidence, if it paves the way for the election to be called and a Tory victory. Many businessmen were impressed by the cleverness of Mr Lamont's creation of a 20p income tax band for the first Pounds 2,000 of taxable income. As one engineering group executive put it: 'If we can get the election out of the way we can get on with doing some business.' The general assessment among businessmen was that although Mr Lamont had improved the Tories' chances the outcome of the election was still in the balance. The two most striking packages of business measures were delivered with clear political messages. This was a budget designed to help repair the government's relations with small businesses, many of them in the recession-hit south east. They will be the main beneficiaries of cuts in business rates (which will affect about 500,000 businesses in England and Wales); the aboliton of inheritance tax for family business; a reduction in the threshold at which value added tax is paid and measures to make large companies pay their bills more quickly. Small business organisations responded enthusiastically. By contrast, large businesses got very little. They will benefit from last year's decision to reduce corporation tax to 33 per cent. They will be pleased that full VAT returns will have to be made quarterly rather than monthly, hence saving administrative costs. But these gains trifle in comparison with what large companies did not get. A campaign by large international businesses to ease their advanced corporation tax burden won them no more than an assurance that it would be dealt with in future. They will be required to publish in their annual reports how long they take to pay their small suppliers. One of the main reasons the chancellor ruled out capital allowances to boost investment was that they would disproportionately benefit big companies. A move to close a tax loophole involving the way companies in part of the same group account for property rent will mainly hit large conglomerates. The other main business beneficiary should be the car industry, which reacted gleefully to a raft of tax changes. These included a halving of car tax, and a 50 per cent increase - to Pounds 12,000 - of the value of a business car which can be claimed as a capital allowance. Retailers and car manufacturers who deal more with private rather than corporate sales should particularly benefit. Mr Lamont has made it easier for companies to give employees cash to buy their own cars rather than take fleet cars. The corporate sector will probably get about 60 per cent of the Pounds 635m which the reduction in car tax will cost the exchequer. However this has to be set against the Pounds 750m a year bill it could be facing from this June from the introduction of national insurance contributions on company cars. General retailers who were shocked by last year's large increase in VAT to help to pay for reform of the poll tax will be relieved that Mr Lamont said there would be no further increase or extension of its scope. Retailers with main beneficiaires among large companies from the cut in business rates. However, the high street will remain a fairly glum place. The Treasury predicts a slow and uncertain recovery in consumer spending despite the income tax cuts. The construction industry will be even more aggrieved. The official forecast is that investment in private dwellings will fall by 1.75 per cent this year and the housing market will remain weak. Construction companies delivered the most negative response to the Budget. Mr Robert Napier, managing director of Redland, the building material group summed it up: 'Construction output is forecast to fall by up to 6 per cent this year. The budget has done nothing to alleviate that.' Sectors of manufacturing industry which have been forced into radical restructuring by the recession, such as basic metal working and mechanical engineering, were also dissatisfied. Machine tool manufacturers which have seen new orders fall by between 30 per cent and 60 per cent were disappointed there were no specific measures to stimulate manufacturing investment. Yet beneath the detail and beyond the immediate political priorities of the budget, Mr Lamont delivered another message which business should listen to carefully. Recovery from recession will be gradual partly because British economic policy and performance is so hemmed in by international constraints. As Mr John Hudson, chief executive of Wagon Industrial, the Telford based engineering group, put it: 'The basic message is that with European economies so integrated no British government can on its own pull the economy out of recession. There are no more quick fixes.'</p>

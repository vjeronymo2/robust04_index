			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Utd Breweries in buy ahead of restructure United Breweries, the financially troubled USM-quoted company controlled by Mr Vijay Mallya, is to buy a private company operating 70 public houses. The deal will more than double the number of public houses operated by the group. The shares, which were suspended yesterday at the company's request, were ahead 1 1/4 p at 6 3/4 p. Shareholders will next week be asked to approve a plan to restructure the group's debts of Pounds 9m, held by four banks. It is likely to involve writing off at least Pounds 2.5m of the debt. Last April the group breached its banking covenants after a Pounds 7.2m write-down in the value of its 76 public houses. A restructuring proposal put together in July fell through. Yesterday the group said it intended to restructure its debt and inject substantial capital by issuing shares to a big new investor, accompanied by a non-underwritten issue of ordinary shares to existing shareholders. 'It is likely that any issue of new ordinary shares will be at a price substantially below the current market price,' the group warned.</p>

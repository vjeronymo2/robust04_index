			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Levitt Group was 'riddled with fraud': Deception of Fimbra alleged at first day of trial THE LEVITT GROUP, the failed financial services company, was 'riddled with fraud, forgery, deception and downright dishonesty' in the 18 months before its collapse in December 1990, it was alleged at the Old Bailey yesterday. Mr David Cocks QC, prosecuting for the Serious Fraud Office, said Mr Roger Levitt, the company's chairman, illegally injected funds, forged accounts and misled Fimbra, the Levitt Group's regulator, to conceal its massive losses and continue trading. Mr Cocks was opening the prosecution's case against Mr Levitt and three other former executives of the company, Mr Mark Reed, Mr Alan McNamara and Mr Robert Price. All four deny a charge of fraudulent trading that alleges the production of false accounts, the fraudulent injection of almost Pounds 21m into the company and the misleading of Fimbra about the state of Levitt Group finances. Mr Cocks told the jury the Levitt Group had grown from humble beginnings in the middle 1970s, when it sold only pensions, to a concern recording profits of Pounds 8m in 1988. By then it was providing a range of investment, tax and financial services to wealthy clients. Mr Roger Levitt, the driving force behind the company, was a 'past master as a salesman', he said. By early 1989, however, the company was in desperate financial trouble and heading for collapse. Between January 1989 and June 1990 the group made losses of Pounds 13m. 'In 1989 the decline and fall of the empire was well on the way. Bankers and others dealing with the Levitt Group thought it was a thriving concern. It fact it was an empty shell making huge losses,' Mr Cocks said. He added that the company could be kept afloat only by fraud and dishonesty on a massive scale. 'Money had to be pumped into that leaky vessel to keep it afloat at all,' Mr Cocks said. He alleged that between April 1989 and December 1990 Mr Levitt illegally injected almost Pounds 21m into his ailing company. The money came from personal loans, share sales and other sources, including Pounds 400,000 invested by Mr Frederick Forsyth, the author, who thought the money would be placed in bonds. Mr Cocks said the company's books then had to be 'cooked' to present this money as genuine income. Fee notes and invoices were forged to show that the Pounds 21m had come from Mr Levitt's provision of 'personal services' to clients. The book-cooking exercise proved so rigorous and thorough that the group's Pounds 13m loss was turned into a stated profit of almost the same amount. Assets were also manipulated so that the company accounts recorded a healthy surplus rather than a 'thumping loss', Mr Cocks said. Without these stated figures, giving the impression of a successful company, nobody would have dealt with the Levitt Group and it would have collapsed, he said. The fraud also depended on the misleading of Fimbra to ensure that the regulator maintained its authorisation of the group, he added. Although Stoy Hayward, the company's auditors, had been 'taken in' by the false accounts, Fimbra was not satisfied. Helped by the accounting firm, it started an investigation. This led to the group's suspension from Fimbra membership and liquidation in December 1990 with debts of Pounds 34m. Mr Levitt was the 'architect' of the fraud, with Mr Mark Reed, his 'right-hand man' since 1976, the other main protagonist, Mr Cocks said. The prosecution said that although Mr Price left the company in mid-1990, he had been involved in the fraud as finance director and Mr McNamara, a former commercial director, was also involved. Mr Cocks told the jury that Mr McNamara had told police: 'When Levitt said jump, I jumped.' The trial continues today.</p>

			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Japanese recovery 'hangs in balance' THE BANK of Japan remained equivocal on the state of the domestic economy yesterday, proclaiming in its latest monthly review that 'Japan's recession seems to be coming to an end', but adding that imminent recovery was not in sight. The central bank's assessment was echoed by the economic planning agency, which said its index of current economic conditions was negative in June for the second successive month. A revival hung in the balance, it added. After positive scores on its so-called coincident diffusion index for the three months to April, the EPA in mid-year announced that the economy had bottomed out. Officials have since attempted to cling to this forecast and brush off fears of a double-dip, while acknowledging that conditions are not improving. The index reading stayed at 10.0 in June, the same level as in May and down from 65.0 in April. The index of leading indicators was 36.4, its fourth month of decline. According to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, industrial production in the three months to June was down 1.5 per cent from the first quarter, hit by a fall in output of consumer durables. The Bank of Japan said its assessment of latest available data showed personal spending still weak as a result of a fall in wage-earners' bonuses and a poor summer. Fixed investment by manufacturers continued to decline despite de-stocking which had 'virtually run its course'. It described export demand as firm, particularly from South-East Asia, but said imports remained stagnant except for foods, textiles and machinery. The bank intervened in currency markets again yesterday to prop up the dollar against the yen, the recent rise of which has been hurting export profitability. The yen closed in Tokyo down Y0.62 at Y103.97.</p>

			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Race under way to raise rice harvest by 60% - Victor Mallet looks at an organisation dedicated to increasing global production TO THE uninitiated, it sounds like an impossible task: in the next three decades the annual global rice harvest must rise by 60 per cent to about 760m tonnes to feed the world's fast-growing population. This surge in production, furthermore, will probably have to be achieved without increasing the land area presently under rice. There is little room for expansion in Asia - where most of the world's inhabitants and most rice-eaters live - and in some countries urban sprawl has actually reduced rice acreages. Since 1980, the total area cultivated for rice has remained steady at about 146m hectares. Yet the scientists at the Dollars 30m-a-year International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in Los Banos, south of the Philippine capital Manila, are confident that they can lead a successful campaign to increase rice yields by the amount required to stave off global starvation for another 30 years. They have done it once; six years after the IRRI was founded in 1960, they contributed to the 'green revolution' by releasing a 'miracle' rice variety called IR8 which doubled and tripled yields and helped to avert famines predicted for the 1970s - and they think they can do it again. Mr Gurdev Khush, an IRRI veteran with 25 years service at the institute, who heads the plant breeding, genetics and biochemistry division, says the first step is to make further improvements to the 'architecture' of the rice plant. By cross-breeding stiff-strawed, dwarf varieties with larger plants that respond well to fertiliser but tend to collapse under the weight of their own grain, scientists have already succeeded in reducing the proportion of straw to grain in the plant to 50:50 from 70:30, and he believes that they will be able to increase the grain's share of the plant's weight to 60 per cent. The IRRI also plans to help increase the total rice harvest by shifting some of its attention from high-yielding, irrigated rice where most advances have been made to date and concentrating on raising yields in rain-fed areas and marginal zones affected by such constraints as salinity and deep water. According to IRRI officials, it should be possible to raise yields for deep water rice to about 3.5 tonnes per hectare from about one tonne now, and to double yields for upland rice to 2.5 tonnes. By comparison, typical maximum yields for irrigated rice are about seven tonnes in the wet season and 10 tonnes in the dry season. IRRI wants to raise the maximum to 15 tonnes by 2010. The institute has made great strides in breeding rice varieties that are resistant to salinity, insect pests and other adverse conditions. But the organisation is finding it harder to further increase maximum yields because genetic and other factors that determine yield are highly complex. One way of raising yields is to use first-generation hybrids (Mr Khush says this can increase yield by another 25 per cent) rather than varieties selectively bred by the IRRI through six or seven generations. The hybrid method has been successfully adopted by China, but the problem is that farmers have to buy new seeds each time they plant the crop, because subsequent generations lose the yield advantage. Genetic engineering may provide a solution. Mr Khush is hoping that it will be possible to put an 'apomixis' gene (such as the one found in millet) into rice, which would allow the hybrids to reproduce asexually and therefore maintain their high yield. 'It's a frontier project,' he says. 'We don't have any apomixis genes in rice as yet.' Rice might benefit in other ways from the young science of genetic engineering. Mr John Bennett, IRRI's senior molecular biologist, is interested in introducing genes from barley which instruct the plant to produce fungus-resistant proteins. 'The reason for the emphasis at the moment on this sort of approach - resistance to biotic stresses - is that we know how to do it,' says Mr Bennett. 'The problem with yield is that we have only a very rudimentary understanding of what controls yield.' The institute does not confine itself to technology. Mr Mahabub Hossain, the agricultural economist who heads IRRI's social sciences division, warned recently that falling unit prices for rice paid to Asian farmers and higher labour costs could threaten the growth of rice production. 'It is time to ask whether Asian countries will be able to meet the future demand for rice of their still rapidly growing populations, given present prices and current technology,' he said. 'The easy gains from modern rice technology have already been achieved, particularly in irrigated rice.' China, the world's largest rice producer and consumer, has already adopted modern technology, irrigated much of its rice and is producing high yields. 'They have done a fantastic job,' says Mr Keith Ingram, an IRRI agronomist. 'There is not much room for improvement.' IRRI scientists nevertheless believe they can increase yields sufficiently to meet projected Asian demand in the year 2020, although they admit there will be environmental costs and other pitfalls as farmers move into marginal areas. They have noticed that paddy fields subjected to three crops a year with no time to lie fallow have started to produce less for a given amount of fertiliser, possibly because of mineral deficiencies. 'We don't understand this phenomenon,' says Mr Khush. 'We are mining these soils.' Only about 3 per cent of world rice production is currently traded internationally, but the idea of growing rice in the (relatively) uncrowded countries of Latin America or Africa and shipping it in vast quantities to Asia is already being mooted. IRRI scientists think they can hold the line for another three decades by helping to increase yields. But they say that the next stage after 2020, if the world population keeps growing rapidly, will be much more difficult.</p>

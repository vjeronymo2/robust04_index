			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Cherilyn Ireton and Edyth Bulbring] </F>   [Text] South Africa's fledgling government this week  resisted insistent demands to become embroiled in foreign  conflicts that would detract from its priority of domestic  reconstruction. At the Organisation of African unity summit in  Tunis this week, President Nelson Mandela was embraced by fellow  African leaders as the continent's miracle-maker, forcing his  aides to squash "exaggerated" hopes for financial aid and  intervention in conflicts and requests that the president take  sides in international disputes. In developments this week:    -- Mr Mandela resisted pressure to send SANDF [South African  National Defence Force] troops to Rwanda or to mediate between  the representatives of the warring government and rebel forces.  Instead, South Africa donated R1-million [rand] to the OAU peace  fund, and will support church efforts to deliver supplies to  Rwanda.    -- South Africa declined to send troops to Lesotho despite  three separate demands that it do so by the Frontline States,  led by Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe. Mr Mugabe argued for  military intervention at the OAU meeting, at the meeting of the  Frontline States in Harare, and at the World Economic Forum in  Cape Town last week.    -- Hopes that South Africa would mediate in the Angolan  conflict were also squashed when Mr Mandela declined a leading  role in this initiative.    -- South Africa rebuffed approaches to immediately cement  full diplomatic ties with North Korea after the Asian country  sent an urgent mission to the Tunisian capital. North Korea is  teetering towards a military clash with the U.S. over its  nuclear programme and is anxious to have South Africa on its  side.    -- Officials said reparation in cash, requested by the  Frontline States for their assistance in the war against  apartheid, would not be forthcoming. Instead, South Africa  would enter joint projects aimed at developing the region.    -- Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo tried to avoid a motion  backing Libya in its dispute with the U.S. and the United  Kingdom over the Lockerbie bombing being tabled at the OAU  meeting.    A presidential aide said that, apart from wanting to avoid  being drawn into energy-sapping disputes in Africa, the new  government was also aware that, as a "newcomer", it had to be  sensitive to other African leaders. The aide added the  government also had to be aware of is own domestic demands  before it committed huge resources to the rest of the continent.    In an interview this week, Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz  Pahad  outlined a pragmatic, interest-driven foreign policy with the  chief priority of securing resources for the country's  Reconstruction and Development Programme.    Addressing a press conference on the issues of Rwanda and  Angola on his return from the OAU, Mr Mandela said: "It appears  that leaders of countries where there is conflict would like to  exploit the experience we have had, but I feel we will achieve  better results if we fit in with the strategies already started,  instead of starting our own independent initiatives."    He said he was willing to consider a possible meeting with  the warring Rwandan parties -- but to listen, rather than to  mediate. There were three other "perfectly competent" African  leaders who were already involved in mediating the conflict, he  added.    On the Angolan issue, Mr Mandela said that, while he had  been  asked to meet President Eduardo dos Santos and Mobuto Sese Seko,  he would prefer to support an initiative started by Mozambique  President Joaquim Chissano.    After the joy at admitting South Africa as the 53rd member  of  the OAU subsided, disappointment surfaced that Mr Mandela had  not done more to bolster the finances of the OAU or the  economies of its members. However, Mr Mandela made it clear  that South Africa would not hand out material resources except  to help raise living standards.    On several occasions he was forced to remind journalists and  delegates that he was not the Messiah and that no individual  would solve Africa's economic and social problems.    Foreign Affairs director-general Rusty Evans said in an  interview in Tunis: "Of course they (African countries) have  expectations...of course, in their misery, they look at South  Africa as something that might suddenly bring relief of sorts.    "At the same time there is a sense of realism. The South  African delegation has been warning against expecting too much."    OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim said people were  being unfair to South Africa in questioning what it would to  strengthen the African economy. "The best contribution South  Africa can give is to become stable and strong and it will then  gradually impact on the continent," he said.    However, leading Africa analyst John Coker was critical. He  said South Africa's R1-million contribution to the OAU peace  fund was insignificant, in dollar terms, compared to the amount  of funds the OAU and its members had spent aiding the struggle  against apartheid.</p>

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Italians vote decisively to change polling system ITALIAN VOTERS yesterday responded to the country's deepening political corruption scandal by voting overwhelmingly for a change to the way they elect their politicians. Preliminary projections of the eventual referendum result gave 82 per cent in favour of replacing a system of proportional representation with a system of majority voting for the senate. This was much higher than predicted by opinion polls and by Mr Mario Segni, leader of the referendum movement. In effect, it has ended the system of proportional representation that has produced 51 unstable post-war coalition govern-ments. There was a high turn-out of 76 per cent for the latest referendum which was Italy's ninth since the second world war and included eight separate issues. The most important was introducing a first-past-the-post system for 238 of the 315 senate seats, the remaining 77 still being covered by proportional representation. The referendum result underlined the demand by an impatient electorate for rapid political change and electoral reform. A separate question on ending public funding of political parties was expected to be endorsed by more than 90 per cent of voters. Illicit funding of political parties has been the main element in the corruption scandals. 'This is a victory for all Italians,' said an exultant Mr Segni, who has emerged as a key figure ahead of a difficult period which must see agreement on a new government and the precise nature of electoral reforms. Mr Giuliano Amato, the Socialist prime minister, met President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro just before polling closed yesterday afternoon. He said holding the referendum had ended the main duty of his four-party coalition, formed last year and including Christian Democrats, Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals. Parliament and party leaders must decide between two options. Either they back Mr Amato to head a new government or they accept that only a new figure, untainted by the scandals, can have the moral authority to carry out electoral reform. The next government's main task will be to produce new electoral laws on which the country can go to the polls. Yesterday Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of the populist Lombard League, called for such laws to be introduced in the next three months. But many politicians predict it would be difficult to agree in time for an autumn poll. The most controversial item - depenalising drugs for personal use - received by far the lowest vote in favour, of only 54 per cent. The Christian Democrats campaigned hard to prevent the abolition of the ministry of agriculture, a key source of their patronage. But only 28 per cent voted against the proposal. The ministry's functions will be transferred to the regions. Abolition of the ministry of state shareholdings, another referendum issue, has in effect already occurred. The other two matters approved were the removal of environmental issues from the control of local health authorities and an end to political control over appointments to the savings bank boards.

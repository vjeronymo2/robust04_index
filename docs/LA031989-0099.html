			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> AIRPORT RULES TIGHTENED  </P> <P> New security orders have been issued to all of Britain's major airports, a  Manchester airport spokesman said. The orders came amid controversy over  warnings received before the December bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. According  to British media, the new directive requires passengers to remove all electric  and electronic equipment from luggage before check-in and to pack such items in  hand luggage for inspection at boarding gates. Investigators have said the bomb  that blew up Flight 103 on Dec. 21 over Lockerbie, Scotland -- killing all 259  people aboard and 11 on the ground -- had been concealed in a radio-cassette  player.  </P></p>

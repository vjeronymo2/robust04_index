			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 11 Mar (XINHUA) -- More than 2,000  deputies to the second session of the Eighth National People's  Congress [NPC] began group discussions of Premier Li Peng's  "Government Work Report" yesterday afternoon. The central topic  of their discussions was how to focus on, serve, and submit to  the overall task of "seizing the opportunity, deepening reform,  opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining  stability," which was proposed by the CPC Central Committee and  expounded in the report.    At a crucial moment when our country is promoting package  reform with breakthroughs in key areas and is accelerating the  pace of building a socialist market economic system, the  deputies, who are in Beijing to attend the NPC session, were  aware of their heavy responsibilities. Lively discussions were  going on in all meeting rooms, with the deputies focusing on  deliberating the "Government Work Report" as they bore in mind  the many problems specific to the grass-roots level. The  discussions were in-depth from the outset as the deputies did  away with pleasantries. Deputy Cheng Weigao from Hebei  maintained: The report gives us a feeling that the party  Central Committee and the State Council are so firmly committed  to deepening reform and to advancing the process of building a  socialist market economic system, that they completely foresee  difficulties and obstacles that may arise on the way ahead, and  that they can take steps to solve problems while the latter are  still in their infancy. He went on to express his views on the  question of deepening reform as part of the overall task. He  observed: If we fail to tackle key aspects of reform this year,  we cannot proceed on all fronts; if we fail to proceed on all  fronts coordinately, it will be difficult to establish a new  system. Successful reform requires efforts to 1) conduct proper  propaganda on reform, correctly guide public opinion on reform,  and carry out ideological and political work among cadres and  people; 2) pay due attention to coordinating the reform process;  3) solve thorny and key problems relating to enterprise reform  and commodity prices; and 4) pay attention to constantly  deepening and improving reform. He said: Enterprise reform is  the most important and crucial part of the effort to deepen  reform; its success or failure is the major criterion for  judging the success or failure of reform as a whole. We should  make enterprise reform the focus and crux of all reforms. Reform  is the driving force, development is the goal, and stability is  the prerequisite. Without stability, reform cannot succeed and  it is impossible to pursue development. In closing, he said  confidently: This year's reform is bound to succeed, the  economy will surely develop, and social stability is bound to  prevail if we focus on the overall task of the entire party and  country and proceed in accordance with the principles and tasks  spelled out in the report. We are fully confident of this  prospect.    Deputy He Zhukang from Jilin maintained: We must proceed  from an overall point of view; understand and handle all aspects  of the relationship between reform, development, stability, and  others; and improve the levels of integration and coordination  in reform and development. On the other hand, the various  problems and difficulties we currently encounter in reform and  development are certain deep-seated contradictions which require  us to highlight key areas and achieve breakthroughs in those  areas while increasing the level of integration and  coordination. He said: This particular point is explained very  well in the "Government Work Report." On the question of work  guidelines, the report focuses on the overall task of the entire  party and country in seizing the opportunity, deepening reform,  opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining  stability. It dialectically links up reform, development, and  stability, and the resultant idea permeates the entire report.  On the pace of reform, the report gives prominence to reform of  the enterprise system, as well as reform of the financial,  taxation, banking, and price management systems, thereby  integrating efforts to establish principal competitors in the  market and to invigorate microeconomic activity with those aimed  at improving macroeconomic management and at setting stricter  standards for market activity. This constitutes a concrete plan  for implementing the decision of the Third Plenary Session of  the 14th CPC Central Committee and for building a socialist  market economic system. On the question of socialist  modernization, the report takes economic construction as the  central task. It makes comprehensive plans for building a  socialist market economic system, as well as for promoting  socialist democracy and a socialist legal system. It makes  wide-ranging arrangements for both socialist material and  spiritual civilizations. This makes it possible to apply our  country's concept of modernization to our work plans more  completely and in a more balanced manner. On economic  development, the report emphasizes the status of agriculture as  the foundation of the national economy, restrictive factors that  have a great impact on the national economy such as enterprises'  economic returns and the investment structure, and the  fundamental goal of improving the living standards. This  reflects deep concern about improving the general quality of the  national economy.    The deputies enthusiastically discussed the issue of how to  focus on, serve, and submit to the overall task. Deputy Yao  Minxue from Ningxia forwarded four viewpoints: First, it is  necessary to base the job of solving problems and handling  various contradictions of the overall task and to understand and  attach utmost importance to the task. The overall task is to  uphold economic construction as the center, seize opportunities,  deepen reforms, widen opening up, promote development, and  maintain stability with the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and  the party's basic line. In addition, it is necessary to unite  more closely around the party Central Committee with Comrade  Jiang Zemin as the core as well as more conscientiously  safeguard the State Council's authority to ensure the smooth  implementation of administrative orders. Second, it is  necessary to safeguard stability. As we cannot do anything at  all without social and political stability, we must strive to  safeguard stability. Speaking on Ningxia, the crux lies in  strengthening the unity of Hui, Han, and other nationalities.  Further, we must encourage them to cleave to each other and  advance through thick and thin. Third, we must uphold the  principle of grasping two links [grasping economic development  and socialist spiritual modernization simultaneously] and taking  stern measures in tackling both. In the course of reform,  opening up, and modernization, it is necessary to effectively  tackle spiritual civilization, strengthen ideological work among  the people, enhance understanding, eliminate suspicions,  regulate sentiment, remove contradictions, readjust relations,  and enhance the spirit to mobilize all forces for the great  undertakings of the four modernizations. Fourth, it is  necessary to do practical work. We should give our best instead  of doing superficial work; speak the truth instead of engaging  in empty talk; and work for practical, instead of fabricated  results. We should do genuine, solid, and practical work to  effectively implement this session's guidelines.    Deputy Li Qiyan from Beijing said: The "Government Work  Report" stressed that we must focus on, serve, and submit to the  overall task in various undertakings. This should be a  principle we must steadfastly implement. He said: Looking from  the point of development, we should pay special attention to  several issues that concern the overall task: 1) agriculture; 2)  changing the operating mechanism of state-owned large- and  medium-sized enterprises; 3) maintaining stable commodity  prices; 4) upgrading the people's living standards; and 5)  safeguarding social stability. We must attach great importance  to these issues that concern the overall task.    Deputy Bai Qingcai from Shaanxi maintained: For a province  to focus on, serve, and submit to the overall task means that in  solving problems and undertaking jobs, it should first correctly  identify its position in the overall task. Under the  prerequisite of focussing on, serving, and submitting to the  overall task, it should maintain coordinated development with  the overall task. Serving the overall task is inseparable from  stability. It is of vital importance to properly handle the  relationship among reform, development, and stability. We  should adopt a realistic and practical approach to thoroughly  implement the intentions of the central authorities in every  task. We should do practical work and effectively nurture and  bring into play the people's enthusiasm.    Deputy Hui Liangyu from Hubei maintained: To focus on,  serve, and submit to the overall task, it is necessary to pay  special attention to solving the following few problems: First,  we should upgrade economic efficiency by ways and means and  should not blindly pursue output value, growth rate, and scales.  Second, we should, through deepened reform, establish a modern  enterprise system to truly bring enterprises to life. Third, we  should further adjust and optimize the economic structure and  focus on solving the "bottle-neck" that restricts national  economic development. Fourth, we should attach great importance  to agriculture and peasants' problems. He said: Agriculture is  a sector that will bring about peace to the country. It is a  sector that involves many people and has a relatively large  social benefit. It is also a relatively fragile sector. We  must not overlook our work for the rural areas and peasants'  interests. Fifth, we should adopt realistic measures to  safeguard social stability.    Deputy Tian Chengping from Qinghai maintained: To achieve  the goal of focussing on, serving, and submitting to the overall  task, we should first forge a uniform understanding. He said:  In recent years, the pace of China's reform and construction  has quickened and the national economy has developed rapidly.  However, some problems have also emerged during progress. An  important reason for the emergence of these problems is due to  the lack of unanimity in our understanding. The good results  obtained in macroeconomic regulation and control last year were  due to better uniformity in our understanding. Problems can be  solved only if everyone from top to bottom uniform their  understanding. He said that Qinghai people supported the  policies of the party Central Committee and the State Council.  They will definitely implement well various tasks with uniform  understanding.    With reference to specific work, Deputy Yue Qifeng from  Liaoning pointed out: When seeking understanding on the issue  of focussing on and submitting to the overall task, it is  necessary to emancipate minds, do practical work while seeking  truth, and work innovatively. It is necessary to give prominence  to reform and uphold the advocation "development is the last  word," and correctly regulate the relationship among reform,  development, and stability to maintain social stability. We  should effectively run state-owned large- and medium-sized  enterprises and strongly nurture new economic growth points. In  particular, we should support leading spots in economic  development so as to maintain a sustained, rapid, and healthy  development of the national economy.    Persons in charge of the State Council's various departments  observed the group meetings yesterday and today to hear  deputies' opinions and to answered their queries.</p>

			<p><P> March 5, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S. NEGOTIATORS CITE LITTLE PROGRESS IN JAPAN TRADE TALKS  </P> <P> Top U.S. trade negotiators told Congress today that they have been disappointed  with the lack of progress so far in efforts to reduce Japanese barriers to  American imports.  </P> <P> But the negotiators held out hope that the weekend summit between President  Bush and Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu may re-energize the stalled  talks.  </P> <P> Deputy U.S. Trade Representative S. Linn Williams told a Senate trade  subcommittee that in the three rounds of talks held so far, little progress has  been made. He said the Japanese negotiators have raised a number of reasons for  being unable to make the reforms sought by the American side.  </P> <P> "We are not satisfied with the progress of the talks," Williams said. "The  basic question is whether the Japanese side sees (the negotiations) as  damage-control and a public relations exercise or as a substantive effort. On  that, the jury is still out."  </P></p>

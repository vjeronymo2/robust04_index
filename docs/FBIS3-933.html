			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Pierre Claassen] </F>   [Text] Paarl March 15 SAPA -- The African National Congress  [ANC] was confident it could pay for its reconstruction and  development plan from existing resources, the party's economics  head, Trevor Manuel, said on Tuesday [15 March].    More than 800 people jammed the Paarl East community hall to  hear Mr Manuel and constitutional expert Dullah Omar. "We have  done all the sums," Mr Manuel said in response to National Party  [NP] criticism that the ANC was offering the impossible. "We  must tell the NP we can pay for it with existing resources."    Explaining the ANC's arithmetic, he said working people paid  extremely high taxes with married women in effect being punished  for having left their kitchens to earn salaries.    "We are going to turn it all around. We are going to look to  companies which are so lightly taxed and strengthen our base  from there..."    Furthermore there were the imbalances in the budget itself.    "Defence is getting more then six times the money allocated  to housing. There's definitely something wrong there. The  secret special defence fund alone is R3.83 billion [rand]-- what  are they doing with it? Printing election posters for the NP?  Such funds cannot only create housing but jobs. It will have to  change after April 27."    Mr Manuel said insurance companies would be told South  Africa  had enough office blocks and super shopping malls. Factories  were needed where the people could work and money needed to be  channelled into the townships.    "Do it, or we will pass laws to help you do it," he said.  International agencies were begging to lend the country money  "but we're saying to them wait a bit, not yet".    Mr Dullah Omar said the ANC had demanded from President F.  W.  de Klerk and Minister of Foreign Affairs Pik Botha the  restoration of citizenship to the people of the TVBC [Transkei -  Bophuthatswana - Venda - Ciskei] states and the re-incorporation  of the homelands at the start of negotiations more than two  years ago.    "They refused. The fact that they propped up the regime of  (former Bophuthatswana president) Lucas Mangope for so long has  cost us dearly. He could have been out of the way a long time  ago."</p>

			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Markets: The summer dog days bite back - Wall Street THESE should be the dog days of August for US stock markets, a period when dealers and investors enjoy short, quiet weeks and long, quiet weekends. Instead, the dogs of August are up and yapping at everybody's heels. Last week it was the near-collapse of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism that kept the markets on edge. This week it was the near-collapse of an overheated gold market, and the final lap of an exhausting and nail-biting budget marathon that saw President Clinton's much-ballyhooed deficit-reduction plan stagger toward the finishing line with the result still in doubt. Somewhat surprisingly, share prices have managed to hold their own amid all the fuss, many posting modest gains along the way. The secondary markets were especially resilient, with the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks on its way yesterday to establishing a new record high on three consecutive days. Equities were helped by a strong bond market, which kept bond yields close to their record lows of just over 6.5 per cent. The week's economic news also provided some support for stocks. The data was not especially encouraging, but at least it was not discouraging. Yesterday's July employment report was broadly in line with expectations. Non-farm payrolls rose 162,000, which was what analysts had been predicting, and the national unemployment rate dropped from 7 per cent to 6.8 per cent. That was a bigger fall than forecast, but economists were quick to point out that the bulk of the fall was due to a decline in the labour force, rather than any upturn in job creation. After the employment figures had been digested, analysts said their views on the economy had not changed - it is growing, but growing slowly. If the week's economic fundamentals were rather flat, the political fundamentals were humming. President Bill Clinton and his aides spent all week frantically trying to garner enough support for his budget to ensure its approval by both the House of Representatives and the Senate. As of midday yesterday, the economic plan, which the President hopes will cut the deficit by nearly Dollars 500bn over the next five years, had squeaked through the House by two votes. Although the Senate was expected to pass it by an equally narrow majority (the vote was due late last night), no one was ruling out the possibility of the plan falling at the final hurdle. The financial markets have been spellbound by the drama of the budget negotiations and voting, not necessarily because the success or failure of the President's plan would have a big impact on the economy, but because the budget's fate will have a big impact on sentiment. Defeat in Congress would be a serious blow to Clinton's presidency, and might leave his administration politically crippled - the worst possible outcome for stock and bond markets. In a narrower sense, defeat would probably lead to a sharp sell-off in the bond market, because in the past few months Treasury investors have bought a lot of bonds in expectation that the budget - the first serious attempt by a US administration to tackle the huge federal deficit - would be passed. A sharp drop in bond prices would almost certainly trigger heavy selling of stocks, which have been sustained for most of this year by low interest rates. In this regard, there is little doubt that the stock markets want the President's budget passed. Yet victory in Congress will not send investors into a wild frenzy of celebration. The consensus of analysts' opinion is that the tax-raising, expenditure-cutting plan will hinder, not help, growth over the short-term, and there are many on Wall Street and beyond who are not happy at the prospect of paying higher taxes, either on payday or at the petrol pump. If it were not for the fuss over the budget, Thursday's extraordinary plunge in gold prices would have been the week's big story. Earlier this year, the sharp rise in gold prices had unsettled stock and bond markets, which feared that investors were rushing to buy gold, the traditional safe-haven in inflationary times, because they expected an imminent surge in US and worldwide inflation. Yet, the sudden reversal in gold's fortunes (prompted primarily by the restoration of order to Europe's besieged monetary system) left the stock markets cold, although it did provide a brief boost to bonds. Either equity investors think the gold price is no longer especially important now that domestic inflation seems to be back under control, or they do not believe gold's five-month rally is really over.  ------------------------------------------------- Monday           3560.99     +      21.52 Tuesday          3561.27     +       0.28 Wednesday        3552.05     -       9.22 Thursday         3548.97     -       3.08 Friday           3560.43     +      11.46  -------------------------------------------------</p>

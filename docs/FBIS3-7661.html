This was revealed by Alberto Encomienda, Philippine ambassador  to Malaysia.    According to Encomienda, the arrested Filipinos are working  in Kuala Lumpur. They were arrested and reportedly imprisoned  by Malaysian authorities after attending a church service. The  Filipino workers were arrested when they allegedly failed to  present documentary evidence showing that their stay in Malaysia  is legal.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] San Salvador, 8 May (NOTIMEX) -- The clandestine  Salvadoran Revolutionary Front (FRS), a group formed by former  rebels, today denied that they had made death threats against  several former rebel commanders and has blamed the "death  squads" for them.    In a communique addressed to NOTIMEX, the FRS said that "at  no time has the FRS issued a communique with death threats  against Joaquin Villalobos, Ana Guadalupe Martinez, Eduardo  Sancho, and others." The communique adds: "We hold the death  squads, financed by big capital and led by Armando Calderon Sol  (president-elect), responsible for any attack against members of  the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN)."  Washington linked Calderon Sol, winner of the runoff elections  held on 24 April, to the "death squads" in documents that were  disclosed in November 1993, even though the politician has  rejected this.    Another communique, allegedly issued by the FRS on Thursday,  threatened applying the "death penalty" to Villalobos,  Martinez, Sancho, "and other traitors" for the support that  Martinez and Sancho gave to the rightist Nationalist Republican  Alliance (ARENA) during the first session of the parliament held  on 1 May. During the session, Martinez and Sancho, members of  the Peoples Revitalizing Expression (ERP) and the National  Resistance (RN), respectively, and five other deputies, also  members of those organizations, voted in favor of Gloria  Salguero Gross for the Legislative Assembly Presidency. In  exchange, the 39 ARENA deputies supported the nomination of  Martinez and Sancho to the offices of vice president and  secretary, respectively.    In 1981, the two organizations, together with the Farabundo  Marti Peoples Liberation Front (FPL), the Revolutionary Party of  Central American Workers (PRTC), and the Communist Party of El  Salvador, formed the FMLN, now an opposition political party.    The communique received by NOTIMEX has the FRS logo, whereas  the first communique received does not. The FRS logo is a star  under which read the slogans "Farabundo Marti lives in the  struggles of the people" and "The weapons shall not be silent  while injustices prevail in our country."    The communique accuses rightist ideologue Kirio Waldo  Salgado  of using the acronym of the clandestine group, which was formed  in January 1993, and "taking advantage of the ideological  differences within the FRS." The communique reiterates: "We  warn the extreme right to refrain from using our acronym.  Otherwise, we will take measures and begin to sabotage the  economy." The communique adds: "We wish to state to the ERP and  RN comrades that the FRS is a disciplined political and military  front and only obeys the orders of its general command."    NOTIMEX received a telephone call from an unidentified woman  who said: "The day we do this (make threats or carry out  attacks) we will make it very clear." Asked about the  communique in which the threats are made, the unidentified woman  said that it was drafted by the "extreme right."    When Villalobos and Sancho learned of the death threats made  against them by the FRS last week, they said that there was a  possibility this was a maneuver by the extreme right. The FRS  is made up of former FMLN rebels who disagreed with the signing  of the peace agreements with the government in 1992.    NOTIMEX learned recently that armed groups operate in the  northern area of El Salvador, as well as in the eastern sector  of the country.</p>

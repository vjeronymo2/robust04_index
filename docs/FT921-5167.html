			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Libya shifts assets from Europe: Tripoli transfers up to Dollars 3bn to Middle East banks as west considers sanctions LIBYA has shifted between Dollars 2bn and Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.1bn-Pounds 1.7bn) of its overseas assets from Europe to banks in the Middle East. It is hoping to put them beyond the reach of western governments which are pressing for retaliation against Tripoli's alleged complicity in the bombing of US and French airliners. The move of government assets emerged yesterday as the US, Britain and France considered asking the United Nations Security Council to back sanctions against Colonel Muammer Gadaffi's regime for failing to hand over two agents accused of bombing a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie. British officials said they would seek a ban on civil aviation to Libya, an arms embargo and a downgrading of diplomatic status for Tripoli. Bankers and officials in London and the Middle East say Libya has already taken steps to pre-empt further economic sanctions by discreetly moving liquid assets from vulnerable banking centres to friendly Arab countries. This massive shift of Libyan assets over the past few months coincides with concerted western pressure on Colonel Gadaffi, including threats of possible military action. Bank of England figures show that between March and September 1991 Libya halved its deposits in British banks to Pounds 781m. Libyan cash and other liquid assets, mainly held overseas to service the import needs of its oil industry, have also been removed from other European centres. Bankers in London confirm that deposits withdrawn in the past few months from Arab institutions in the city have been placed with banks in Bahrain. 'Libya feels it has some sympathy among other Arab countries,' said a London banker familiar with the shift. 'And the obvious place to put the money is with banks in the Gulf region.' Libya's overseas assets measured by the Bank for International Settlements in Basle totalled Dollars 6.5bn at the end of September 1991. In a separate move aimed at protecting its assets from seizure, Libya is understood to be demanding payment for its oil exports, wherever possible, in Swiss francs, rather than dollars, according to bankers and oil industry executives. The aim is to minimise the number of transactions which must be cleared through US banks, where Tripoli fears they would be vulnerable to seizure. All international transactions in dollars, even if they take place outside the US, must be cleared through New York. The US authorities have sought to use this to impede dealings they regard as undesirable, such as trading in dollars with Vietnam, with which Americans are forbidden from doing business. 'Libya since the end of December has not transferred money through the dollar if it can help it,' said one senior Arab banker. Another Libyan banker, who has been monitoring the steady flow of Tripoli's assets into havens, said the regime had learnt from its experience in 1986 when Washington froze Dollars 2bn of Libyan assets in the US in retaliation for its alleged part in terrorist attacks. To head off sanctions, Libya has raised the possibility of handing over the two agents to the US, on condition that the US in turn offers an 'improvement of bilateral relations'. The suggestions comes in a report to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, compiled after the return of his special envoy from Tripoli. This contains a series of proposals by Libya to resolve the confrontation. But British officials said these were 'confusing' and 'inadequate'. Diplomats in New York said the offer, revealed in the UN secretary-general's report, was an improvement on Libya's earlier intransigence, but insufficient to prevent the US, Britain and France from pursuing possible sanctions. Libyan money has long been on the move, Page 4</p>

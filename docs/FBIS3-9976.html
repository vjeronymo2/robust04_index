			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the Cuban Foreign Ministry on 26 </F> February in Havana -- read by announcer]    [Text] The Cuban people express their profound indignation  over the horrendous massacre committed on 25 February at the  Ibrahim Mosque in the West Bank town of Hebron, an occupied  territory of Palestine, against the numerous faithful who were  there performing their Muslim religious rituals.    This genocidal action came at a time when, despite the  enormous obstacles still to be overcome, limited progress is  being made in the slow and protracted process of negotiations  between the organizations [as heard] and PLO representatives  seeking to consolidate the agreement signed in September 1993 on  Palestinian sovereignty over the Gaza Strip and the Jericho zone.    Simultaneously, a number of rounds of negotiations were  being  held between Israel and its neighboring Arab states, encouraged  in the objective of achieving a just and long-lasting peace that  would benefit all peoples of the region, based on the full  recognition of their inalienable rights.    Savage actions like those carried out in Hebron do not  contribute to the climate of mutual understanding and trust that  could pave the way for the cherished peace; on the contrary,  they stir up the passions of hatred and vengeance and deepen the  wounds of the peoples, in this case, the long-suffering  Arab-Palestinian people.    Although the top Israeli officials have promised to  investigate the events and to impose justice on the perpetrators  of the crime, it will be very difficult to restore the climate  of confidence that will promote the complex and difficult  process of the quest for regional peace.    It is unquestionable that the enemies of peace in the Middle  East have inflicted a heavy blow on efforts being made in this  regard. The Ministry of Foreign Relations of the Republic of  Cuba wishes to extend to the friendly Palestinian people the  feelings of solidarity and sympathy of the Cuban people on the  occasion of this horrible tragedy; at the same time, it hopes  that the Israeli Government officials will adopt immediate  measures to prevent the repetition of such genocidal actions  against the Arab-Palestinian people of the occupied territories.    In this moment of sorrow and suffering, we want to reaffirm  the irrevocable solidarity of the Cuban people and Government  with the just cause of the Palestinian people, to whom we ratify  our support of their efforts in the quest for peace and for the  full recognition of their inalienable right to build their own  independent and sovereign state.    [Signed] Havana, 26 February 1994.</p>

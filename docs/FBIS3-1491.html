			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with kwaZulu Chief Minister Dr. Mangosuthu </F> Buthelezi by SABC announcer Freek Robinson in Ulundi; followed  by response by Independent Electoral Commission Chairman Justice  Johann Kriegler with SABC announcer Max Du Preez in the  Johannesburg studio, from the "Agenda" program -- live]    [Text] [Robinson] Before I introduce my questions,  introduce a few observations, firstly to say that the questions  I'm putting to you are questions that I picked up from various  people, to put to you so that we get some clarity. Secondly, I  am not in a position to understand Zulu cultural ... culture at  its heart, and therefore I would really like you to give us some  clarification. Can I start by asking you: If the king says he  advises his people not to vote, what does it mean in practice?  Does it mean that he is actually ordering them not to vote?    [Buthelezi] No, I think that the king is expressing no more  than a dissatisfaction, because in fairness to the king I think  that you must recall that on the 17 January we went to see Mr.  De Klerk about these concerns and he also saw Mr. de Klerk on 14  February, and also on 1 February -- and 14 February and 22  February -- and each time he said that he wanted Mr. De Klerk as  the de facto and de jure head of state to fix up or to put right  that which he asked him to put right as far as the sovereignty  of his kingdom is concerned, before the elections, so that  therefore, when he speaks like that I think he is saying no more  than the fact that he cannot be positive towards elections if  elections in fact are removing from the table, these very deep  concerns about the monarchy itself as an institution and also  about the kingdom of KwaZulu.    [Robinson] But the question specifically that I put to you  --  let's put it a different way: Would people on the ground,  ordinary folk in the street, interpret the king's advice as  being actually an order not to vote?    [Buthelezi] Well, he has not put it as an order really, as  far as I have heard him, but he says that most of the ...  [changes thought] many Zulu people agree with the king -- I  think many of his subjects agree with him, and therefore,  because he believes that if this matter is not sorted out before  the elections, which is not just the opinion of the king -- I  think yesterday in the talks that we had with Mr. de Klerk it  seems to me that at long last Mr. de Klerk himself appreciates  that something must be done about this and possibly that a  meeting is needed either between himself and the king and Mr.  Mandela to try and sort this out as soon as possible, possibly  this week, so quite clearly the king is saying to his people,  that you know, if there is going to be a unilateral imposition  of this 1993 constitution, which doesn't say anything about his  kingdom, doesn't say anything about the sovereignty of kwaZulu,  shared sovereignty or even full sovereignty, then he means that,  therefore, he cannot recommend to them that they should  participate in an election which literally expunges the Zulu  nation from the South African map.    [Robinson] Let's leave that for a moment. Can I get back to  the meeting that you have had with State President de Klerk  yesterday. What does it mean when you say jointly that  mechanisms will be put in place to ensure free and fair  elections? What does it mean?    [Buthelezi] I suppose that it is just another word, of  saying  that booths will be set up where it is possible -- facilities  will be made available to the Independent Electoral Commission  [IEC]. That's how I understand that to mean.    [Robinson] Does it mean in practice that you are giving your  full cooperation in a process to ensure free and fair elections?    [Buthelezi] Well, Freek, from the very word go when the  judge  came to see me in Ulundi on the 17 of last month, I actually  assured him that I regarded it as a democratic right for  citizens of South Africa who want to participate in the  elections to do so. In the same way the converse of that coin  is that those who do not want to participate have a democratic  right not to participate, and that has alway? been my guideline  as far as that is concerned, and from the very word go, in fact,  I asked the judge on the 17th to set up mechanisms as soon as  possible. It was my suggestion, not even his. Therefore, I just  don't understand, you know, I am being badgered by the question,  will you give him full cooperation, because even the resolution  that was passed by the cabinet of kwaZulu, in fact, makes it  very, very clear that we have prepared, wherever it was possible  to do so, to give the Independent Electoral Commission full  cooperation.    [Robinson] But it seems to me, Dr. Buthelezi, on the basis  of  what the IEC has said, that they did not get the impression that  the members of the Legislative Assembly were in the mood to give  that cooperation. In fact, they have said, the IEC, that the  proceedings had been stage managed to humiliate them.    [Buthelezi] I don't know -- anyone with anything between  their ears would really have a very low opinion of me and my  colleagues to say that we could stage manage any humiliation of  the judge and the Independent Electoral Commission. Let me just  say, by the way, that I have known the judge for more than 20  years. In fact at one time he represented, as an advocate, the  interests of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] when one of our  publications was banned by the government, so therefore, I have  always held him in high esteem, and then, let us go to the  question of how the judge came to Ulundi. The Judge was here on  the 17 February, and then he -- suddenly he requested, you know,  another meeting with me -- not only with me, he wanted a meeting  with the king. He wanted a meeting with members of the Assembly.  He wanted a meeting with Amakhosi [chiefs]. He wanted a  meeting with senior officials of the government. So therefore  ...    [Robinson interrupting] Dr. Buthelezi ...    [Buthelezi continuing] So, therefore, I had to put together  a  meeting where he could deliver a message to all these people,  and therefore, the resolution of the cabinet was actually read  out to him before others spoke, and to say in those  circumstances, when I did just what he wanted by bringing all  those people together, that he wanted together, is nothing but  sheer poppycock, from my point of view, with all due respect to  him.    [Robinson] Dr. Buthelezi, I have been told by our technical  staff in Johannesburg that we have limited time but may I at the  same time also appeal to our colleagues at FCC [expansion  unknown] to try to give us a few extra minutes since we have had  these problems. Could I put it to you, now just to come to very  practical terms: What are you going to do, to ensure from your  side, that your cooperation will mean, in practice, that there  will be free and fair elections?    [Buthelezi] Well, the judge asked for facilities from us. He  asked for schools. We told him the number of schools that are  available to the government will be made available to the  Independent Electoral Commission. We made a distinction between  those schools which are actually government schools and schools  that are actually the property of communities -- in our  communities, and that, therefore, we have no authority over  those. We told the judge that all government buildings, whether  it's courts or police stations, that belong to us, we have made  available. So all the facilities that he wanted from us, which  it was possible for us to make available for election purposes,  we said we would make available, so I really don't know what  more was expected of us.    [Robinson] Dr. Buthelezi, can I attend to something else: Do  you align yourself with the declaration by the king for  sovereignty of the Zulu kingdom?    [Buthelezi] Let me say this -- the king never raised this  subject before when we were trying to negotiate a federal  formula, that the self-determination of the Zulu people would be  exercised through a federation, but when they failed to deliver  that federation, when the king then raised these subjects  because he became anxious when realizing that we were being  pushed into a unitary state, whereas we came into the Union of  South Africa willy nilly, in fact, through the barrel of the  gun, therefore, as a loyal subject of the king I said I was  disarmed. I think in one interview by the SABC [South African  Broadcasting Corporation] TV I said that I was completely  disarmed when the federation was rejected, because what can I  say to the king when he says -- what about my future? What  about the [words indistinct] as an institution? What about the  kingdom of KwaZulu institution, because after all, KwaZulu was a  sovereign state, was an independent sovereign state and which  was not ordained by God that we should be part of one South  Africa. But all along I have always said myself that history  had made us that and that, therefore, I preferred a system where  we could continue to be part of South Africa.    [Robinson] Now, can I put it, since you quoted it in those  terms, that you said in an interview earlier, some years ago  that there is nothing ordained by God which forces apartheid and  the ideals for self-determination on human society. At the time  you were actually very scathing about the idea of  self-determination.    [Buthelezi] I was talking about self-determination as  spelled  out by the apartheid regime. I mean self-determination is  recognized by the United Nations. I was not talking about self  ... [pauses] Self-determination is not something, you know, that  I regarded this day, but in that context it was the self-  determination through the ideology of apartheid.    [Robinson] Could I put it to you Doctor, with great respect,  some people say the mere fact that the king has proclaimed  freedom and sovereignty for the Zulu kingdom is in fact a device  to ensure for himself, and for you as his Prime Minister,  continued power without contesting elections.    [Buthelezi] The king doesn't need to contest an election.  The king doesn't have to beg for his sovereignty -- or  sovereignty of his state or of his people from anyone. The king  doesn't need to do that. The king -- in fact that sovereignty  is not compared by any person because we were a sovereign  people, and when now you come and say that well, now we are  putting right that what was wrong, by allowing everyone in the  country to be free, to decide what form of state he wants, the  king has every right to do so, and it's nonsensical to say, to  suggest that, you know, the king is doing this to ensure power  for himself and so on, I mean, there are kingdoms right on the  border of KwaZulu, one in Lesotho and one in Swaziland, of  nations that we respect very much but which are smaller than the  Zulu nation, now if we take the absence of any federation, the  king has every right to say that he wants to know what sort of  future that he and his people will have.    [Robinson] Thank you Dr. Buthelezi, unfortunately I'm being  told by the people in Johannesburg that we don't have any more  time, but I would like to continue our conversation and record  it so that we can still broadcast it at a later stage. Thank  you very much for your cooperation, and I pass over to  Johannesburg.    [Du Preez] Judge Kriegler, a quick reaction from you on what  Mr. Buthelezi had said.    [Kriegler] I heard what chief minister said. I didn't hear  what I wanted to hear, namely, that there will be real,  meaningful, on the ground cooperation -- ostensible cooperation,  protestations of willingness, simply will not enable us to do  our job, and I'm appealing to the chief minister, and I hope  Freek Robinson can record it in the rest of the evening, that  they will settle down and talk real business to us and not have  ostensible cooperation and actual frustration.    [Du Preez] Thank you Mr. Justice Kriegler. That's it for  tonight.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 13/6/1994 -- The National  Peasant Christian-Democratic Party [PNTCD] started to collect  signatures necessary to trigger the procedure of suspension  against Romanian President Ion Iliescu, said Chamber of Deputies  member Razvan Dobrescu at a press conference on Monday, 13 June.    Reiterating the PNTCD's belief that President Iliescu has  breached the "independence of the judges" through his statements  made during a visit in Satu Mare, northern Romania, referring to  the issue of the nationalized houses, the PNTCD deputy drew  attention upon the serious consequences of any interference with  judges' rulings. The PNTCD deputy emphasized the fact that his  party considered as a "real danger" the maintaining in office of  a president who "does not watch for the good functioning of the  state authorities."</p>

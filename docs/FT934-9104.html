			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Arafat halts trip to face critics MR YASSIR Arafat, chairman of the PLO, cut short a visit to Portugal yesterday and flew to Tunis for emergency meetings, amid mounting criticism of his management of political and economic talks with Israel and international donors. Mr Nabil Amr, an adviser to Mr Arafat, said a group of PLO officials had drafted a document criticising the chairman's political and negotiating performance. Israel's Finance Ministry said it had still not got a message from Mr Arafat confirming the start of critical economic talks due to open in Paris on Monday. The talks will set the agenda for future economic relations and decide whether there will be a customs union. Palestinians and international donors have voiced strong criticism of lack of leadership on economic policy as the date for Palestinian self-government in the occupied territories draws near. A World Bank official said this week the PLO had to move swiftly to appoint professional personnel for the recently announced Economic Council for Development and Construction.</p>

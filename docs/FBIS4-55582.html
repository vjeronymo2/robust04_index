			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by R. Barjaktarevic: "A Dialogue Only at a Round </F> Table"]    [Excerpts] Dr. Ranko Babic, federal deputy in the Chamber  of Citizens, has resigned from his post of president of the  Serbian Radical Party [SRS] County Committee for Kosovo. He  told BORBA that there are indications that Serbian President  Slobodan Milosevic will soon visit Kosmet [Kosovo and Metohija].  Why is Dr. Ranko Babic resigning from his function of party  head for Kosovo?    I have resigned for several reasons. They primarily have to  do with considerable professional obligations at the university  and in research work. Moreover, there are private reasons  involved. There is also disagreement with certain moves within  the party, but I do not wish to discuss this in detail, Ranko  Babic said curtly. [passage omitted]    As a federal deputy, Ranko Babic was ready to talk to BORBA  in greater detail about indications of "preparations for  Milosevic's visit to Kosmet." This was prompted by President  Milosevic's statement in front of the minister of state at the  British Foreign Office Douglas Hogg in connection with "giving  full political and cultural autonomy to the Albanians," and "We  shall have no problems with that."    If we are to believe the diplomatic dignity of the British  minister of state and our interpretations of Mr. Milosevic's  answer, strengthened by the lack of any denial from his office,  this statement could mean President Milosevic's full agreement  with Douglas Hogg's approach that a maximal political and  cultural local autonomy should be created in Kosmet, similar  that in the 1974 Constitution. This would mean that Milosevic  was denying his own position and closing the circle, but from  below with his well-known statement in Kosovo Polje "no one must  beat these people." [sentence as published] I wish to believe  that the statement "we shall have no problems with that" is the  result of a misunderstanding or a breakdown in communications.  Otherwise, President Milosevic is attempting a fatal somersault  that would be catastrophic for him. In connection to this, we  may mention his penchant for inconsistent political acrobatics.    On the other hand, however, increased awareness -- even  significantly increased awareness -- can be detected in the  visit of representatives of the Yugoslav Army and the Federal  Defense Ministry, and in the related demonstration maneuvers of  the army and police units in Kosovo. Even the elite 63d  Airborne Brigade from Nis was brought in and executed a  spectacular demonstration maneuver. I believe that this is  intended to show the authorities' great interest in the region.  There are even indications that President Milosevic is  preparing to visit Kosovo and Metohija in the coming period.  Looking at this in the context of President Milosevic's earlier  statement, we would be very disappointed in him if it turned out  that the purpose of demonstrating such great military and policy  "interest and allegiance" in and to Kosmet is designed simply to  temporarily calm the resident Serbian people and dissuade them  from moving out of Kosmet, while somewhere hidden from view,  arrangements are being made that would be disastrous for us,  says Babic.    Are not all these preparations for initiating a dialogue  with  the Albanians?    I would consider it quite abnormal that, in the context of  all this, Milosevic's arrival in Kosmet would mean the promotion  or the initiation of a process of dialogue with representatives  of the ethnic Albanian political organizations, but one that  would ultimately lead to an unacceptably oversized autonomy.</p>

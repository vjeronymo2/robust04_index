			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Insurer shifts to salaries for agents Colonial, a Kent-based life insurance company, yesterday became the latest organisation in the sector to announce a shift to a system of paying salaries and bonuses rather than commission-only to its employed direct sales force, Alison Smith writes. From next year the 570 employed sales agents will move to salaries of up to Pounds 18,000 - with bonuses typically taking total pay to about Pounds 25,000. The 80 self-employed sales agents for Colonial will continue to be paid on a commission-only basis. Mr Sandy Grant, deputy general manager, said he was sure that in dealing with customers the two types of sales agent would both make sure investors were clear about their remuneration structures.</p>

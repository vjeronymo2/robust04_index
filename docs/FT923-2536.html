			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Leading Article: The Bundesbank and Britain IN PRESTIGE and pride, performance and power, the German Bundesbank is an exceptional central bank. Prestige stems from its statutory mandate to maintain German price stability independent of government 'instructions'. Pride is a result of its anti-inflationary track record, and its contribution to the stability of a country which in the first half of this century unleashed two world wars. The Bundesbank's performance feeds and is fed by the credibility it has established on the financial markets. Power has been augmented by the postwar circumstances which have made Germany Europe's strongest economy, and turned the D-Mark into the anchor of the European Monetary System. The bank which in all but name has become Europe's central bank is not a machine. Yet, as an institution, it can prove dangerous for politicians. Chancellor Konrad Adenauer once complained that the bank was 'responsible to no one'. Bundesbank policies contributed directly or indirectly to the breakdown of three German governments, those of Mr Ludwig Erhard in 1966, Mr Kurt Georg Kiesinger in 1969, and Mr Helmut Schmidt in 1982. High German interest rates may yet play a part in the downfall of Mr Helmut Kohl. The Bundesbank is an organism with which governments tangle at their peril. Exacting standard All this was known to Mr John Major when, as chancellor of the exchequer, he took Britain into the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) in October 1990. In anchoring themselves to the D-Mark, ERM members have set themselves an exacting standard; the Bundesbank has often wondered aloud whether Britain could live up to it. Mr Karl Otto Pohl, the president between 1980 and 1991, forecast in September 1990 that, if it tried to link sterling to the D-Mark 'for all time', the UK could face 'mass unemployment and enormous payments problems'. The challenges for all ERM members have risen greatly because of the Bonn government's policy errors over German unification. Large German deficits have given an inflationary boost to German growth. This has forced the Bundesbank to raise interest rates far higher than foreseen two years ago. Countries - within and outside the ERM - which had hoped to hitch a ride to price stability on the Bundesbank's coat tails have suffered a bumpier journey than they imagined. Such countries have also seen their own efforts to reduce inflation (in France, Finland, Norway, Denmark, Belgium and Sweden, to below German levels) disregarded by the financial markets. If there is a culprit, it is, however, Mr Kohl and his fellow politicians, not the Bundesbank. An important reason for Mr Pohl's resignation was his unheeded criticism of Mr Kohl's mistakes. Not unblemished For all this, the Bundesbank has not emerged unblemished from the fray. Under Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Mr Pohl's successor, the Bundesbank has placed too much emphasis in the past 12 months on trying to cut growth in M3 money supply - an indicator which, partly because of unification strains, has become a less reliable yardstick of future inflation. More important, Mr Schlesinger has laid himself open to charges of disingenuousness or worse through Tuesday's hints of sterling devaluation. As an academic economist, Mr Schlesinger is entitled to believe that the pound's level against the D-Mark is too high; he may also have been put under exceptional strain by this month's pressures for lower German interest rates. But as a practising central banker, he should know when to keep his mouth shut - especially when foreign exchange turbulence adds to the speculative German currency inflows, the disruptive effect of which Mr Schlesinger most fears. Britain cannot blame the Bundesbank for its economic problems. But under the rules of the European Monetary System, it is entitled to assistance, rather than to sniping. Whether or not Europe proceeds towards economic and monetary union, central banks and governments will need a modus operandi for better monetary co-operation. Europe's interests will be ill-served if the Bundesbank contributes to a climate in which it becomes a scapegoat for troubles outside Germany.</p>

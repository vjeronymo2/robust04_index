			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / PLO hits at Israeli decision to close borders Israel took new security measures yesterday aimed at curbing Islamic extremists, as fears grew among Palestinians that Israel intended to impose a permanent separation between the two communities. The Palestine Liberation Organisation condemned Israel's decision to close indefinitely its borders with the Gaza Strip and West Bank, preventing tens of thousands of Palestinians from working in Israel. The government is to allow in 15,000 more foreigners to replace Palestinian construction workers, suggesting the ban will not be lifted quickly. The Israeli cabinet also agreed unspecified measures to give the security forces greater freedom to confront the Hamas Islamic group, responsible for Wednesday's suicide bombing of a commuter bus in Tel Aviv, which killed 21 people. 'The government decided to put at (security services') disposal additional means required in order to intensify actions against Hamas and its military wing,' the cabinet said. Officials said the measures could include arrests, deportations, demolition of homes, tougher processes of detention and interrogation, the expansion of the police force and pre-emptive raids. This may represent the start of a radical policy of physically separating Israelis from Palestinians. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's premier, said on Wednesday Israel would have to decide soon whether the separation would become permanent. Hours after the Israeli cabinet meeting ended, rockets were fired by guerrillas in Lebanon into northern Israel, but no one was injured. Earlier, Lebanon said seven people had been killed by Israeli shelling of south Lebanon in retaliation for the Hamas suicide bombing. Mr Marwan Kanafani, official spokesman for Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, said the latest Israeli moves would punish 2m Palestinians for the actions of a handful of militants, and would breed more hatred and instability. 'The measures are a declaration of war, of economic and social war, against Palestinian society and will affect very negatively the peace process,' he said. Mr Kanafani said the measures would create despair among Palestinians and play into the hands of the extremists. He added that the only hope for curbing extremism was to speed up Israel's withdrawal from the occupied West Bank, and introduce economic measures that would 'give Palestinians a sense that they had a better life ahead after more than 25 years of Israeli occupation'.</p>

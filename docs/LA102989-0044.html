			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXPRESSING SOME ROQ-SOLID POSITIONS  </P> <P> Reeb speaks of wanting to maintain KROQ's "nutty, offbeat and unpredictable"  qualities while changing station format and marketing strategies. Is there not  a contradiction in trying to research, format and market unpredictability?  </P> <P> He then goes on to state that he fired deejay Dusty Street because she was a  "renegade." Well, it was such deejays who made KROQ the nutty, offbeat and  unpredictable station it once was. Obviously, there's no place for them in Mr.  Reeb's new scheme of things.  </P> <P> JEFF DiPERNA  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "ank": "Schulte Elected New DGB Chairman"] </F>   [Excerpts] Berlin, 14 June -- At the 15th Federal Congress  of the German Trade Union Federation [DGB] on Tuesday [14 June],  the delegates elected Dieter Schulte as the new chairman. The  board member of the IG Metall Metalworkers' Trade Union was the  only candidate to succeed former DGB Chairman Meyer, who died in  May. Of the 565 delegates, 437 voted for Schulte. That is 75.7  percent. [passage omitted]    In his inaugural speech, Schulte promised the trade unions  that he wants to "lead and bring together." He said the major  task of trade unions is to fight unemployment. They must manage  to strengthen the DGB's ability to mobilize its members, while  concurrently maintaining the ability to achieve compromises.  [passage omitted]    Klaus Kinkel, chairman of the Free Democratic Party of  Germany [FDP], also considered the employment situation the most  important issue of European policy. The Liberals know what  unemployment is, Kinkel said, even if they are frequently denied  that knowledge by the trade unions. Jobs cannot be created by  decree. That is why the FDP advocates a labor policy oriented  toward a market economy. Kinkel also spoke of "deregulation,  privatization, and cutting bureaucracy," which met with much  disapproval from the delegates. The FDP chairman praised the  trade unions for moderate wage agreements concluded this year.  He said he hopes this standard will also be applied in the  talks on privatizing the German Post Office. New,  future-oriented technologies play a large role in creating new  jobs, Kinkel said. He once more called for a simplification of  the social system. It is a matter of restructuring, not  abolishing, the welfare state. Regular jobs must be given  precedence. The FDP will not accept blame for being "socially  insensitive," Kinkel said.    A number of trade union chairmen contributed to the debate  on  the DGB's annual report. IG Metall Chairman Zwickel criticized  the DGB for not having a clear social concept. Zwickel said  this is no criticism of Engelen-Kefer, DGB's social politician,  but trade unions should increasingly agree on common policies  that are then to be made binding for all. "We will remain the  haunted ones if we do not comment on major topics," Zwickel  said. Media Trade Union Chairman Hensche also made the criticism  that the trade unions are just drifting along, without  developing their own political alternatives. "We are not  exactly going from strength to strength," Hensche said.    Hensche very fiercely criticized the policy of the Federal  Government. Constantly blaming the trade unions of fighting for  possession means accusing "the possessions of those who do not  have any." "This country is not heading toward a crisis because  the poor have become too rich," Hensche sneered. Modifying  [Immanuel Kant's] categoric imperative, Hensche coined a "social  imperative." It should read: "Do not demand any sacrifices from  others that you are not prepared to make yourself."  Sarcastically, Hensche recommended that the chancellor should  work in public service at 80 percent of the pay earned by the  lower wage classes in western Germany.    Postal Trade Union Chairman van Haaren repeated his  rejection  of the second postal reform. Contrary to the "privatization  ideologists," he fears that the privatization of the post office  will destroy jobs instead of creating them. The Federal  Government must keep the majority of share capital in the post  office; the public tasks of the Federal Post Office have to be  maintained, irrespective of its legal form; and the postal  holding must maintain a clear responsibility for control and  coordination. The conference adopted a motion calling on  Bundestag deputies not to agree to the postal reform unless  these conditions have been met.</p>

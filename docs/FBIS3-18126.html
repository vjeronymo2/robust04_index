			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "ban.": "`No New Debts and Taxes'"] </F>   [Text] Bonn, 22 Feb -- In an address to the Social  Democratic Party [SPD] Party Council in Bonn on Tuesday [21  February], SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping repeated his statement  that, in its election program, the party would reject any  increase in new net debts and any increase in rates and taxes.  With a view to the SPD's election chances, Scharping defended  his position -- which was developed in accordance with Deputy  SPD Chairman Lafontaine -- against criticism from parts of the  party's left wing. Yet, according to the chairman of the Party  Council, Ringstorff, the session was characterized by broad  agreement. Unlike the past, it was distinguished by the  determination to concentrate on "essential" issues. The SPD  will not be diverted from its course by attacks from the  Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU], a  course intended to shift the fight against unemployment to the  center of the election campaign. Ringstorff said the criticism  of the CDU/CSU to the SPD's past Germany policy showed that the  CDU and CSU would prove to be "bad losers" after the election.  In addition, in communities in eastern Germany, the CDU was not  hesitating to enter into alliances with the Party of Democratic  Socialism [PDS] against the SPD.    The spokesman for the "Frankfurt Circle," the group of  left-wingers within the SPD, Von Larcher, warned against a  "deflationary austerity policy." In view of the mass  unemployment the SPD must not do without a policy of stimulating  the economy. Also on behalf of other representatives from the  party's left, Von Larcher called for a state "future investment  program." In a second address, Scharping rejected the views of  the party's left-wingers. Before, at their meeting in  Oer-Erkenschwick at the weekend, Scharping had criticized their  catalogue of demands by emphasizing that, in its economic  policy, the SPD must not bank on state measures alone. Even  representatives of the party's left showed that they were  impressed by Scharping's claim to leadership on Friday.    The Party Council avoided a discussion on differences  between  Lafontaine and Presidium Member Dressler in connection with  pension policy. These differences were sparked off by  Lafontaine's remark that the pensioners might have to suffer a  loss in income in real terms depending on the result of the wage  agreements. Dressler had then demanded that, if necessary, the  pensioners be entitled to compensation measures; yet,  fundamentally, he did not want to challenge the "pension  formula." Lafontaine brought up reservations in terms of  finance policy and described Dressler's position as an  "individual inconsiderate opinion." According to members of the  SPD leadership, the SPD Executive Committee did not finally  close the matter in its discussion on Monday.    The leadership of the Party Council was confirmed in its  offices. However, with 34 votes, Chairman Ringstorff received  significantly fewer votes than his deputies Poss (55) and Mrs.  Weber (51). The bad result for the chairman of the SPD land  group of Mecklenburg Western Pomerania was explained by the way  in which he did his job so far. In the past debates on asylum  policy, he once published a list, which later turned out to be  wrong, on supporters of and opponents to a Basic Law amendment.  Only about half of the 110 members of the Party Council  attended the session in Bonn. It was said that due to heavy  snowfalls and difficult road conditions the remaining members  were unable to attend the meeting; their absence, however, also  proves the importance of this party body within the party: The  Party Council is not a decisionmaking body but only a  consultative one.    SPD Federal Manager Verheugen presented the Party Council  with a paper on fighting right-wing extremism. The fight  against right-wing extremism must be stepped up. They have to  be stripped of the false image of "respectability." The  behavior of those who officially represent the party should be  the subject of public debate.</p>

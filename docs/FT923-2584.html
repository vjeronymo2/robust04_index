			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Spain hopes peseta will hold up SPAIN was fighting late last night to keep the European Exchange Rate Mechanism alive and sharply criticised Britain's decision to suspend its membership of the ERM. 'It is important to preserve the system and suspension of membership is a bad decision,' a senior official at the economy ministry said. Nevertheless, he was sympathetic to British charges that the German Bundesbank had been less than helpful to sterling. Spanish officials went into the late-night meeting of the EC monetary committee in Brussels with a brief to persuade their partners that a realignment within the system was by far the best option. The economics ministry official said this option implied effective devaluation of certain currencies within the ERM. This was favoured by both France and Germany. Spain was still determined last night that the peseta could not be justifiably grouped with sterling and the lira as a problem currency. The official insisted that the peseta had fared far better than sterling and the lira during yesterday's market turbulence. . 'By midday yesterday we ceased intervening and let the peseta find its own market position within the mechanism and the peseta closed at Pta67.5 to the DM, short of its 69.1 floor,' the official said. 'We were not tempted to raise interest rates and at all times the peseta was within its band.' The official said that the market's confidence in the peseta was demonstrated yesterday by 'significant' orders to buy Spanish public debt. Speaking in Berlin where he was attending a meeting of the Socialist International, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, said the peseta was resisting the crisis 'fairly well' and that despite the 'turbulence in the markets' there was still 'a relative confidence in Spain'. But he said the government was prepared to take 'whatever measures have to be taken'. Dealers estimate that on Tuesday the monetary authorities spent up to Dollars 2bn to hold the peseta at Pta65.15 against the DM and that at least as much had been spent last week.</p>

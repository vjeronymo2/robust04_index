			<p>BFN     [Text] A number of political parties and organizations in  the Republic of Yemen have stressed that the Yemeni people are  capable of destroying a band of rebellious adventurers who have  acquiesced in plunging our people into a painful and bloody  conflict that can only advance the interests of the enemies of  Yemen and the attempt to take it back to the pre-May 1990 era.    The political parties and organizations also stand ready to  confront all the conspiracies that are targeting Yemen and to  make sacrifices in the cause of its national rights -- unity,  democracy, and freedom.    A statement, issued by 24 political parties and  organizations, said that what the rebels are doing today is a  cheap attempt to forcibly slice off a part of the Republic of  Yemen. The Yemeni masses, who on 22 May 1990, thronged to the  streets to celebrate the inauguration of the Republic of Yemen  and the realization of unity -- the dream of their fathers and  forefathers -- and [word indistinct] self-determination. The  masses, who said yes to the 15 May 1991 Constitution of the  Republic and went to the polls in the first free and fair  elections in the region -- even in the Arab world at large --  are the same masses who are now taking a determined stand  against their rebellious and adventurous enemies.    The remarks made by the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] on  Yemen, added the statement, amount to a serious precedent that,  rather than advance security and stability in the Peninsula,  opens the road for many conflicts in each of the states of the  region and creates the potential for negative and unwanted  consequences. The statement paid tribute to the brother State  of Qatar's lone voice at the ministerial session of the GCC with  respect to the unity of the Republic of Yemen. All Arab states  and the United Nations and the international community, as well  as all political parties and mass organizations around the  world, were urged by the statement to stand by the Republic of  Yemen and its right to defend its sovereignty and territorial  integrity and to adopt a noninterventionist posture. The  statement warned against the consequences of further  interference in the Republic of Yemen's domestic affairs or  taking the rebels' side.    The statement was signed by the following parties and  organizations: The General People's Congress; the Yemeni Reform  Grouping; the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party; unionists in the  Yemeni Socialist Party; the Nasirite Popular Unionist  Organization; the Right Party; the Democratic Nasirite Party;  the Nasirite Correction Party; the al-Ummah Party; the Popular  Forces Union; the National Forces Union; the National Union of  the Yemeni Unity Forces; the League of the Sons of Yemen  Unity--the Legitimate Leadership; the League of the Sons of  Yemen Party--the Executive Committee; the Liberation Front  Party; the Yemeni Renaissance Movement; the National Democratic  Front; the Popular Organization of the Liberation Front Party;  the Arab Ba'th Organization; the Revolutionary Democratic Party;  the Democratic September Organization; the Social Democratic  Party; the Islamic Monotheism and Action Movement; and the Yemen  Revolution Struggler Organization.</p>

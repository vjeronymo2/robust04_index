			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Terence White] </F>   [Text] Kabul, May 4 (AFP) -- At least 10 people were killed  and 80 wounded in a brief but intense overnight infantry attack  by rival factions battling Afghan President Borhanoddin Rabbani,  frontline and hospital sources said Wednesday.    A combined infantry force of Prime Minister Golboddin  Hekmatyar and Uzbek General Abdol Rashid Dostam based in and  around the Old Microrayan housing estate attacked pro-Rabbani  troops across the Kabul River in an attempt to establish a  foothold there.    "The enemy's morale was too weak to sustain an infantry  attack so they used their heavy weapons," frontline commander  Sabor of the defending pro-Rabbani troops told AFP.    Speaking from his base in the new Microrayan housing estate  facing the Uzbek opposition dug-in no more than 100 metres  across the Kabul River, Sabor said three of his men were wounded  while he had received a report that at least 10 of the attacking  force had been killed.    The 30-minute exchange of small-arms fire was the most  intense witnessed by locals for several weeks. Even to the rear  of the combat zone in Wazir Akbar Khan residential area,  incoming rounds smacked against houses like rain-drops on a tin  roof.    Pro-Rabbani troops based in the apartments of the new  Microrayan housing estate have converted what were once bedrooms  and sitting-rooms to frontline bunkers with firing slits  protected by massive walls of sandbags.    Even so, from the heights of the Uzbek-occupied Maranjan  Hill  behind Old Microrayan, direct hits by Dostam's heavy artillery  gunners have broken up the steel-reinforced concrete walls of  these four-storey apartment blocks like they were lumps of dry  cake.    On Wednesday, delegates said to be representing 15 peace  organizations met at the Intercontinental Hotel and proposed a  unified draft aimed at ending the factional fighting in  Afghanistan.    In 11 articles which rehash previously tried and failed  proposals, the Unified Draft of the Afghan Joint Reconciliative  Assembly calls for a ceasefire and the convening of a national  Grand Assembly to elect a parliament and new Afghan leader.    While considerable thought has been given to the mechanics  of  selecting delegates to the National Assembly, the establishment  of a ceasefire -- a necessary prerequisite for an election -- is  mentioned only in passing.    The prospects of immediate peace in Kabul can only be  advanced by a sincere reconciliation between the two main  rivals, Rabbani and Hekmatyar, who until now have refused to  come to terms with each other, observers said.</p>

			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Effect of benefits move 'hard to assess' UNRELIABLE figures for the take-up of social security benefits make it impossible to tell if there has been any improvement since the system was reformed five years ago, the Department of Social Security said yesterday. Government officials believe the first figures since the reforms of 1988 show no evidence of any significant change in take-up levels. But the department said different benefit rules and the poor quality of statistics meant comparisons were 'not meaningful'. The results are a setback for ministers who had hoped the reforms, which were intended to increase the targeting of benefits and make claiming easier, would lead to noticeable improvements. The figures took three years to compile - about 18 months longer than normal because of the backlog of work facing DSS statisticians. Plans for a new 'family resources survey' sponsored by the department should lead to more accurate figures later this decade. Yesterday's results show that, in 1989, 90 per cent of available cash was claimed and that 80 per cent of people entitled to income-related benefits claimed them. For housing benefit, 83 per cent of those entitled to claim are estimated to have taken up the benefit - suggesting a slight rise on figures for 1987. Similarly, take-up figures for family credit suggest a small increase to about 57 per cent compared with the family income supplement it replaced. Take-up of income support, at about 75 per cent, apparently fell in comparison with its predecessor, supplementary benefit. Labour described the figures as very disturbing, especially after fierce criticism of the social security system by the National Audit Office.</p>

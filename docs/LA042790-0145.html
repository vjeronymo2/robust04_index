			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN;  </P> <P> MOST TEACHERS SKIP SCHOOL'S OPEN HOUSE  </P> <P> A teachers' boycott of the annual open house at Foothill High School left only  six to eight teachers to greet a light turnout of about 120 parents Thursday  night.  </P> <P> George Waibel, a music teacher and president of the Foothill Faculty Club, read  a brief statement to parents at a general meeting before the open house: "We  the teachers of Foothill High School have chosen not to participate in  tonight's open house to express our displeasure and dismay concerning the  continuing state of contract negotiations conducted by your elected  representatives. . . ."  </P> <P> Waibel said the school's teachers voted 51 to 3 last week to boycott the open  house.  </P> <P> Some parents were supportive of the teachers' stand and others were upset by  it.  </P> <P> Leslie Ebert, who has a daughter and a son at Foothill High, said the teachers  are "just not doing their job. In any other profession, you would get sued for  that action."  </P> <P> But John Logan, whose daughter attends Foothill, said, "I think they're  underpaid and frustrated, and that leads to decisions like not showing up."  </P> <P> The Tustin Educators Assn. last week called for teachers to boycott open houses  and stop assigning homework in protest of unresolved contract  negotiations.SHANNON SANDS  </P></p>

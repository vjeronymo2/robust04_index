			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Poland's sell-off plan is defeated POLAND suffered a serious political and economic setback yesterday when parliament rejected the country's mass privatisation programme. The plan's defeat in the Sejm by 12 votes increased pressure on the coalition government of the prime minister, Mrs Hanna Suchocka, who appeared visibly shaken and accused the opposition of 'irresponsible behaviour'. It also jeopardised talks on a Dollars 450m (Pounds 317m) World Bank structural adjustment loan, which had implementation of the scheme as one of its conditions. The privatisation programme also forms an integral part of an agreement between Poland and the International Monetary Fund for a Dollars 660m stand-by loan. An informal opposition coalition, encompassing former communists and anti-communists, united to defeat the coalition, which was also deserted by 10 deputies from the nationalist ZChN group, unhappy about the involvement of foreign managers in the scheme. The mass privatisation plan, first outlined two years ago, would have transferred about 600 state enterprises into investment funds managed by foreign advisers. Shares in the funds would have been distributed at a nominal charge to the population. The funds were to have been dissolved after 10 years, with the proceeds distributed to shareholders. Mr Janusz Lewandowski, the privatisation minister, said after yesterday's vote that 'the country's political elites had decided to put a brake on the economic reforms and exclude all those Poles who would have gained by the programme'. The government lost the final vote on the law despite defeating a series of amendments, put by both the left and the right-wing parties aimed at excluding foreign managers from the scheme. The government also overcame amendments which would have reduced it to a pilot project involving no more than 200 enterprises. Ms Suchocka now faces the problem not only of rescuing the coalition's cohesion but also deciding whether to press on with the plan.</p>

			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BROAD-BASED GROUP BACKS PROPOSITION ON  HOUSING  </P> <P> A broad-based group of politicians, bankers and anti-poverty advocates Thursday  urged voter approval of ballot measure Proposition K, a $100-million housing  bond issue that would renovate 5,000 earthquake-unsafe apartment units, create  homeless shelters for more than 1,000 people and provide loans to struggling  first-time home buyers.  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson said the measure is critical to efforts  to save badly needed affordable housing.  </P> <P> A similar measure in 1988 failed by only a few thousand votes.  </P> <P> State Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), speaking at a dilapidated Skid Row  slum hotel that officials said would not withstand a major earthquake,  predicted widespread voter support. "Almost one year ago . . . there was a  massive earthquake in Northern California which resulted in $6 billion in  damage, 63 deaths," he said. "That earthquake was a grim reminder of what  could, and frankly will, occur here."  </P></p>

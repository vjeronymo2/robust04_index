			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Rosewood's Oil, Gas Assets for Sale: Buyers are being sought for the oil and  gas assets of Rosewood Corp., the holding company owned by the trust estate of  heiress Caroline Rose Hunt, whose financial unit is fighting for control of the  financially troubled Los Angeles-based insurer First Executive Corp. The assets  of Rosewood Resources are being shopped around as part of a divestment strategy  that saw the sale last year of the Bel-Air Hotel in Bel-Air and the Hana-Maui  hotel in Hawaii, a Rosewood spokesman said. The assets include oil and gas  properties in the Midwest, Southwest and Rocky Mountain areas of the U.S.;  offshore properties in the Gulf of Mexico and the Dutch North Sea, as well as  onshore fields in France.  </P></p>

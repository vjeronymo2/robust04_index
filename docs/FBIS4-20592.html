In Figure 1, the calculated DOS  are compared with the measured P 3p DOS. It is found from Figure  1 that the experiment remarkably agrees with model (c), but does  not agree with model (a) nor (b). Consequently one of the P  sites is vacant and is not replaced by B. We conclude that the  structure of B[.sub]13[/]P[.sub]2[/] is that shown in  Figure 2.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-33B>      Figure 1.

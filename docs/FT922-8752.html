			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Travel agents dubbed 'incompetent and lazy' MANY TRAVEL agents are 'incompetent and lazy' and waste money by making basic errors and giving sloppy advice, according to a report from Which?, the Consumers' Association magazine, published today. The magazine says more than half its inquiries at 253 travel agents in 10 cities were handled badly, with agents telling half-truths and quoting unnecessarily high fares. Only one in five agents was able to find the cheapest routine flight to Nice  -a Pounds 129 special offer from British Airways. A branch of AT Mays in Manchester assured a researcher that a Pounds 244 Air France flight was the cheapest available; the eight Lunn Poly branches in Glasgow quoted five different fares. Three out of five agents were unable to give satisfactory information about holidays in Mykonos and two out of five provided less than useful advice about Majorca, one of the most popular holiday destinations. Which? says, however, that some agents performed with great competence and spent much time finding the best deals. It says Hogg Robinson provided the best service of the five big travel chains.

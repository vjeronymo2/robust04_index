			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Latin trio concludes free trade pact Mexico, Venezuela and Colombia have concluded negotiations on a free trade pact to come into effect in the first half of next year, report Damian Fraser from Mexico City and David Pilling from Santiago. The treaty will bring together economies with a combined population of about 150m, and gross domestic product of more than Dollars 360bn (Pounds 241.60bn) in 1991. Mexico has already signed trade pacts with the US and Canada, and separately with Chile. Colombia yesterday signed a free trade agreement with Chile. Mexico's trade ministry gave no details of the agreement, except that it covered six areas: access to markets; rules of origins; investment rules; government purchases; trade in services and intellectual property. Tariffs will be gradually phased out, rather than abolished immediately.</p>

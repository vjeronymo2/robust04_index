			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Food and Drink: Enjoy the flat times - Champagne's crisis The champagne industry is in a deep crisis, albeit often to the benefit of the consumer who can enjoy wide variations in price but does not always appreciate sharp differences in quality. The crisis largely started with the big 1990 vintage, when some deregulation of grape prices led to a general rise of 25 per cent to a record FFr32 per kg - plus bonuses paid by grape-hungry merchants who believed that a continuing boom would leave them short of supplies. Around FFr36 to FFr38 a kg was paid in the leading vineyards on the Montagne de Reims and the Cotes des Blancs, and a minimum of FFr25.6, plus bonuses, in the outlaying districts of the Marne, Aube and Aisne. It takes 1.2kgs of grapes to produce a bottle of wine, and this accounts for 70 per cent of net cost. So merchants secured all the grapes they required - at a price. And the maximum permitted limit of yields was as much as 12,000kg per hectare. The commonly prescribed and publicised maturing time for a bottle of champagne is three years before it is put on the market, although the minimum legal limit is one year. Since 1990, the opening grape price, as agreed by the merchants and growers has fallen each year. Last autumn it came down to FFr20.50 for the top districts and FFr16.40 at the bottom, with only nominal bonuses. Moreover, the fall in sales and the big vintages led to a three-year agreement to cut the maximum permitted yield to 8,400kgs. So the growers last year received half the 1990 price for their grapes, and were only allowed to produce two-thirds of the previous quantity for making into champagne. Accordingly, many of the nearly 16,000 growers are in trouble. Of the 29,000 hectares in production in Champagne, only 13,000 are owned by their growers. A further 16,000 hectares are worked under costly leases or share-cropping agreements. All but a tiny proportion of the top 35 merchants are running at a loss. There are several reasons for this. Their current non-vintage blends include the over-priced 1990 wines. Most are heavily in debt to the banks. They hold an average of four years' stock and interest charges are between 5 and 8 per cent a year. Those with substantial holdings of vineyards in relation to sales, such as Bollinger and Roederer, are better placed. Many champagne consumers in the UK believe that the 28 grande marques, headed quantitively by Moet &amp; Chandon, and the wider-known independents are unreasonably dear. What is less appreciated is that, although there is only one authorised appellation - 'Champagne' - there are essentially two sectors: one is high-quality wines and the other, which has stolen the limelight and some of the sales since the recession, the premier prix. These brands buy a large proportion of the second pressing (and they used to buy the third, until it was banned). They are sold as soon as possible after the one-year minium bottle-ageing. Recently, I tasted a bottle said to be 18 months old, but which may have been even younger. It had a very odd nose and did not taste like champagne at all. Wines of this class, the basic cost of which is FFr34, sell in the French supermarkets at about FFr45 francs a bottle, including VAT. Somewhere along the line someone is losing money, possibly at the insistence of the banks. These premier prix champagnes have between 25 and 35 per cent of the French market, and have hurt the 5,000 growers who sell under their own label at medium prices and the co-ops. Together these two groups used to account for nearly half the French market. This does not imply that all premier prix champagnes are unacceptable or that champagnes that sell in the UK at between Pounds 12 and Pounds 10 are poor. But they are in a different class from the brands that have made champagne's reputation throughout the world. The grandes marques buy a large proportion of their grapes from the grands and premiers crus that occupy a third of the total appellation area. They will press the grapes in their own or other approved press-houses. But it is the selection of their still wines, perhaps from as many as 100 villages, that provides their quality and their house style. Then there is the expensive three years in bottle before marketing. Inevitable too, are the promotion costs. Omitting vintage champagnes and special cuvees, which are in a different league, does it mean that finer champagnes are over-priced? But are the crus classes of Bordeaux and the single vineyards of the Cote d'Or too dear? It depends on how much one likes fine claret and red and white burgundy. In Champagne, with its blending system, the finer champagnes are at least much more consistent in quality. As the more expensive grapes pass out of the blends, will the classic champagnes become cheaper to consum-ers? No, because prices have already been cut. In France the normal price on the shelf of Moet &amp; Chandon's Brut Imperial is FFr115 (Pounds 13.83) a bottle - the same as in 1988. However, the price of grapes at the coming vintage is likely to alter little: perhaps 50 centimes or a franc more than last year's FFr20.5 for the grand crus. A rise in the maximum permitted yield from 8,400kg to 9,000kg was a small concession to the growers. But the banks are unlikely to increase their loans either to the merchants to pay more for their purchases or to the growers to make a bigger harvest. Overall, the total indebtedness of the industry is greater than its turnover. Jean-Claude Rouzaud, head of Roederer and president of the Syndicat des Grandes Marques said: 'We need five years of low grape prices.' This will not be welcome to the growers, who may prefer instead to sell their grapes to the co-operative or produce their own champagne, but for champagne lovers now is the time to buy. Competition has led to marked technical improvements, and this extends down to some of the premier prix brands. At the classier houses, where stocks often exceed five years' sales, it is resulting in more mature champagne sold at stable prices and the quality / price level is higher than ever.</p>

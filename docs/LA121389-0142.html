			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOLD POLICY IS MADE, AND INVESTORS YAWN;  </P> <P> ARGENTINA: PRESIDENT CARLOS SAUL MENEM HATCHED AN AMBITIOUS ECONOMIC PROGRAM  WHEN HE WON OFFICE. LACK OF PRIVATE INVESTMENT MAY RUIN IT.  </P> <P> After barely five months as president, Carlos Saul Menem has run into  Argentina's traditional unmovable obstacle: the sheer intractability of the  nation's problems. Menem's ambitious economic program, highly touted abroad but  deeply controversial in Argentina, is in trouble. Worse still, political  signals from the Argentine electorate are far from comforting.  </P> <P> As soon as he moved into the presidential palace, Menem broke with many canons  of his Peronist legacy. He drew up an economic plan known here as the Plan BB,  for Bunge y Born, the giant grain conglomerate from which his new economic team  was drawn. The plan included opening the economy to imports and foreign  investments, privatization of large chunks of the state-owned sector, cuts in  consumer and industrial subsidies and stabilization of the exchange rate after  an initial devaluation, together with moderate wage increases and substantial  price hikes. The immediate aim was to control inflation, then running at a  triple-digit rate. The long-term objective was to make the Argentine economy  grow again, essentially by handing it over to the private sector, in consonance  with similar strategies under way in Mexico and Chile.  </P> <P> On paper, the Menem-Bunge y Born match seemed to be a winning combination. The  new president had the electoral mandate and the political legitimacy stemming  from his Peronist heritage. The grain firm has close ties with the rest of the  Argentine business community and, equally important, with international  financial circles. But like many other economic blueprints in Latin America  today, this one rapidly encountered two underlying, virtually unmanageable  problems. One comes from below, the other from abroad.  </P> <P> The attempt to dismantle a significant part of the Argentine welfare state --  which has survived several military dictatorships and a flurry of conservative  policies in the late 1970's -- has produced tremors in the working class.  Wildcat strikes by railroad workers and a split in the national labor union  along pro- and anti-Menem lines are among the first warning signs of  grass-roots discontent. The election of extreme right-wing Gen. Antonio Domingo  Bussi as senator from Tucuman, a mid-sized city in the interior, rocked the  Establishment that had hoped the Radical and Peronist parties could maintain  their tidy two-party arrangement. More important, the election of a socialist  mayor in Rosario, the nation's second-largest city, where food riots erupted in  June, dealt a serious blow to Menem, who had carried that erstwhile Peronist  bastion with a wide margin in the presidential vote.  </P> <P> But beyond the limits that Argentina's electorate and unions can set on Menem's  modernization drive, the main obstacle resembles the one confronting other,  similar attempts in Latin America: The domestic private sector and the foreign  business community simply do not seem interested. Last week the Argentine  government was forced to decree new price increases (of more than 50%, for  instance, for gasoline) and a 34% devaluation of the austral because of a new  spurt of inflation in November and another run on the central bank's reserves.  By early December, despite an adequate trade surplus and a virtual suspension  of payment on its debt service, the government was losing $50 million a day.  Instead of bringing money into the country -- the intent of the deal with Bunge  y Born -- the Argentine private sector was still sending it out. One can  privatize state-owned industries and sharply cut back the state's role in the  economy only if there is somebody willing and able to buy what is being sold.  </P> <P> Latin American private investors, with the possible exception of those in  Brazil and Chile, are requiring political and economic conditions to bring back  their flown capital that no government can realistically meet. So presidents  and finance ministers plunge into economic feats of daring that must have  massive private-sector funding, to succeed, only to find that the money stays  in Miami, Los Angeles or New York. They then look to foreign creditors or  investors, and discover that in the age of perestroika, Europe-'92 and the  Pacific Rim, Latin America (including Mexico) is not the most exciting  investment in sight.  </P> <P> Menem's program of economic renewal has not yet foundered. Discontent from  below and indifference abroad are both still manageable, and the jury is still  out on the free-market economic policies that he and others are experimenting  with. But the dangers posed by diminishing most Argentines' standard of living,  at least in the short run, or, if the program fails outright, continued  stagnation due to under-funding, are real.  </P></p>

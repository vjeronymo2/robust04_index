			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Radical Tories urge benefits overhaul ABOLITION of the state earnings-related pension scheme and retirement at 67 for men and women are among radical changes recommended today by the Thatcherite No Turning Back group of Tory MPs. They advocate the progressive privatisation of the existing 'pay as you go' national insurance system to encourage personal insurance and pension provision. Ending child benefit through the reintroduction of child tax allowances is also proposed in a package which the group says is aimed at concentrating resources on those most in need. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, who is conducting a review of existing benefits to establish whether their cost is likely to undermine the economy in the years ahead, is a member of the group. Other proposals outlined in a pamphlet by five backbench members of the group include: Integration of non-contributory benefits into a single 'whole-person' benefit, paid at different levels according to individual circumstances. The new benefit to be subject to a system designed to encourage claimants to move 'into earnings' yielding a genuine increase in their income. Entitlement to unemployment benefit to be reduced from one year to six months. Retirement age for women to be raised, initially from 60 to 65 - to bring them into line with men - with 67 eventually becoming the common retirement age. Invalidity benefit to be subject to income tax, and the earnings-related element to be phased out. Abolition of tax relief on mortgage interest and the ending of rent rebates and rent allowances. None of the proposals would affect existing pensioners or those approaching retirement. Mr Donald Dewar, Labour's shadow social security secretary, dismissed the proposals as a 'clutter of ill-digested ideas' and called on Mr Lilley to disown them. The authors of the pamphlet are: Mr Alan Duncan (Rutland and Melton), Mr Iain Duncan-Smith (Chingford), Mr Bernard Jenkin (North Colchester), Mr Barry Legg (Milton Keynes south west) and Mr John Whittingdale (south Colchester and Maldon).

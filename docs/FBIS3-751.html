Good evening  gentlemen, and welcome.    [Kriegler] Good evening.    [Moseneke] Good evening.    [Mashokwe] Judge Kriegler, let me start with you. Free  political activity -- is that going to be going on in  Bophuthatswana now?    [Kriegler] Most certainly, that is one of the priorities at  this stage. Priority one is to get law and order and ordinary  civil society going as soon as possible. But as the same time  electioneering, free political activity is absolutely  imperative. We have already put all of our plans in motion. The  IEC will be visibly present in Bophuthatswana, or the  ex-Bophuthatswana and the various composite sectors thereof  within the next two days.    [Mashokwe] You are presently in Mmabatho, what about the  other areas? Seemingly concentration is here now and the other  areas are not well attended, like in Itsoseng, for instance,  where we were yesterday?    [Kriegler] Now Leslie, I made the point, maybe it was not  picked up. It is our duty to see that the election as a  reality, as a gateway to the future, is visible in all of the  parts of the former Bophuthatswana, and we will see that it is  done within the next few days.    [Mashokwe] Advocate Moseneke, we would want you to explain  this to us: it would appear there is a party called the  North-West Democratic Christian Party, something like that,  which we are informed is going to be led by President Mangope.  What is the story there, was this party registered before. Are  we seeing a new leeway being given to President Mangope, or  ex-president Mangope to come on board here?    [Moseneke] Leslie, the North-West Party was registered in  time together with all the other parties who were registered,  and duly submitted a list within the time that lists had to be  submitted. It is quite well known now that we were approached  with an application to amend the name of the party to be  North-West Christian Democratic Party and the photo of the  leader was also changed to be the photo of ex-president Mangope.  So clearly that is the vehicle that he is likely to use and he  is entitled to if he wants to, to run elections under the name,  North-West Christian Democratic Party.    [Mashokwe] Are we talking here of a party that is going to  be  running for national and regional offices. Do you remember?    [Moseneke] Come again, will you repeat that please?    [Mashokwe] Is the North-West Christian Democratic Party  going  to be contesting elections, regionally and nationally?    [Moseneke] No the registration is limited to the province of  north-west, so that is where they would contest the elections,  and not nationally.    [Mashokwe] Talk to me about the preparations, it would  appear  even in South Africa itself preparations are not well, at an  advanced stage. Are you going to be able to distribute your  resources in the north-west area, which was not within the plans  I would imagine?    [Moseneke] Let me start with the first remark. Preparations  are well underway, and we are working as hard as we can to make  sure that the whole country is ready for elections on the 26th,  27th and 28th. And in Bophuthatswana obviously the start there  is much -- is late, and we are sending, as Judge Kriegler said,  a special SWAT team whose function would be to be bring  Bophuthatswana up to the same speed as the rest of the country.    [Mashokwe] Judge Kriegler, I would like you to explain to us  exactly how visible these people are going to be here, come  tomorrow, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday?    [Kriegler] First of all our monitors will be in  Bophuthatswana by not later then Tuesday. We will have  established offices in Bophuthatswana by not later then midweek,  that is election administration, voter education, and our  ordinary monitoring teams will be there from not later then the  middle of this week. It is a special effort that is being made.  Our program for the access of political parties will be  particularly stressed in Bophuthatswana, and there is no reason  at all to doubt that the citizens of the north-west will be as  well able as the rest of the citizens of this country to make  their choice freely and fairly at efficiently administered  voting stations on the 26th, 27th, and 28th of April this year.    [Mashokwe] Already there is concern about the fact that the  National Peacekeeping Force will be overextended come the 26th,  27th, and 28th. Are you going to have bodies and men who will  then be deployed in this region?    [Kriegler] There is no reason to link the National  Peacekeeping Force to the elections. The ordinary agencies of  law and order in the country, in collaboration with the IEC will  be in a position to ensure that the electorate can exercise  their right to choose their own future.    [Mashokwe] Advocate Moseneke, if you could come in here.  We talk about a free and fair election that is going to be  exercised in Bophuthatswana, yet we saw the might of the SADF  [South African Defense Force], ISD [Internal Stability  Division], SAP [South African Police] and everybody else in this  area -- are they going to be forcing the South African way of  thinking, or way of looking and demanding things as opposed to  allowing people to choose and decide whether they want to be  free and partake in these elections?    [Moseneke] Leslie, you know that they are there, present  now,  for a very specific and limited purpose -- that is, to restore  law and order, and to ensure that normal services are available  to the citizens of Bophuthatswana, indeed who are South Africans  citizens. We perhaps should start talking about South African  citizens. Having said that, we will be monitoring to make sure  that the presence of the army, which normally would be  inconsistent with free and fair elections, does not result in  that. We will have to make sure that they limit themselves to  the normal law and order functions, which will not in any way  impede free electioneering by all parties -- the normal  functioning, for instance, of voter education programs, and all  other preparations that we need. An example that comes to mind  would be establishing voting stations, and I've no doubt that  the security forces would have little or nothing to do with that  sort of function. So, in short, they are there for a limited  purpose to restore law and order, and to protect the rights of  our citizens there present, but not to stand in the way of  conducting a free and fair election.    [Mashokwe] What about President Mangope's party, is it also  going to be given the kind of leeway, freedom to run amock here  and hold rallies?    [Moseneke] Every party duly registered would be entitled to  conduct rallies, and Mr. Mangope's party is a party so  registered, and they too should be allowed the opportunity to  canvass, and the opportunity to fight elections like any other  party which would be contesting elections in the north west  region.    [Mashokwe] We seem to hear, Judge Kriegler, your colleague  there, Advocate Moseneke, talking about: we will made sure that  people get free and fair elections, we will do this and that.  How visibly are we going to see the IEC -- what are we talking  about when we say we will make sure that the defense force  doesn't get involved in this -- who are we and what are we  talking about here?    [Kriegler] Leslie, let's get one thing clear. An election is  about people and political parties. An election will succeed or  fail because the political parties and their supporters play the  game. We are the referee. If the players want to make a fight  of it, we will have to be tough about it. We have the muscle,  we have the necessary legislative power to prosecute people, to  ban parties from participation, to scrap their votes in any area  where they don't make it possible for others to play. We will  not hesitate to do that. But, we will also at the same time,  particularly in areas such as the ex-Bophuthatswana, be  singularly alert to ensure that the remnants of an earlier  regime are not permitted to pervert the political process; nor  will we permit the abnormal situation where there are military  forces there at the moment to reduce the unrest and to bring the  country back to sensible normal operations -- we will not allow  those forces unreasonably to interfere with the right of all  political parties to put their point of view. And I may say,  the real point is not to allow the parties to put their point of  view, but to allow the people who have got to make a choice to  hear all of the choices that are available so that they can make  an intelligent choice come the election.    [Mashokwe] Advocate Moseneke, your last word on -- we have  like 30 seconds left. We know that Bophuthatswana has been  independent. A new administration is in place and the laws of  this country are still in place anyway. The IEC has legally no  right to be exercising its authority here?    [Moseneke] Well, IEC clearly has a right to exercise  authority in Bophuthatswana. You need to look at the electoral  act, you'll see that the country is defined to include  Bophuthatswana, so we are acting lawfully. Let me just very  quickly say to you, who are we? We are the monitoring  department, we are the many monitors that you'll see in  T-shirts, in our cars with our logos and our flags. You'll see  pamphlets, you'll see offices were people can go. That is what  we are, that's the IEC. You'll find it there present in all the  regions of Bophuthatswana.    [Mashokwe] Thank you, Advocate Moseneke, Judge Kriegler.  Thanks for talking to us. That was "Newsline" from Mmabatho,  and I may just mention that the pictures of President Mangope  have been removed from this hotel where we are, and the  conference room has been changed from Manyane Conference Room to  Conference Room only. That was Leslie Mashokwe from Mmabatho,  and from the team here, goodnight.</p>

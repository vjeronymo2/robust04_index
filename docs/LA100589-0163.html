			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF HISTORY;  </P> <P> ENGLISH WOMAN IS PERFECT -- NOT ONCE BUT TWICE -- IN BRITISH SENIORS EVENT  </P> <P> A tree trunk and a sloping green helped England's Wendy Russell make golf  history with two holes-in-one during the opening round of the British Women's  Seniors Championship Wednesday.  </P> <P> Russell aced the 127-yard fourth hole at the Wrexham Golf Club when her tee  shot, a seven-iron, struck a tree to the left of the green, ricocheted onto the  putting surface and dropped into the hole.  </P> <P> At the 118-yard eighth hole, Russell sent an eight-iron toward the right of the  green, hoping to catch the top of a bank and have the ball roll toward the  hole. She placed the shot perfectly and the ball slid into the cup.  </P> <P> "I feel quite numb," said Russell, who finished with a seven-over-par 78.  </P> <P> Rounds with twin aces are rare, and officials said the feat had never been  accomplished in a top-level British event.  </P></p>

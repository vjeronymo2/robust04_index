			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 23 (YONHAP) -- Pyongyang prefers Najin in  the northeastern special economic zone to nearby Chongjin City  for the proposed direct inter-Korean shipping route to minimize  North Koreans' exposure to southerners, according to the Korea  Maritime and Port Administration (KMPA).    "Despite the fact that several ships leased by South Korean  shipping companies have entered Chongjin port, the North Koreans  insist that South Korean ships use Najin port," KMPA officials  said Monday. "We think that's a step to prevent the shock of  opening from spreading to other places by separating the special  economic area from other regions."    Chongjin has an advantage over Najin in terms of railroad  facilities but suffers a freight vehicle shortage, while Najin  offers better land transportation with good road conditions, the  officials quoted ethnic Koreans living in China as saying.    Pyongyang seems to have designated Najin as the South-North  direct trading center in the East Sea, the officials said.    Negotiations on the direct shipping route are stalled,  however, because the North wants the Seoul government not to  interfere in direct investment by South Korean businesses in the  development of unloading and transportation facilities at Najin  port, according to the officials.</p>

			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Hack work for Hawke White-collar unemployment can evidently cause quandaries even for ex-premiers. Australia's Bob Hawke, in particular, is casting around for a renewed career following his December dumping by the Labor Party after more than eight years as prime minister. Unlike Malcolm Fraser and Gough Whitlam, he seems set on staying in the public eye. One long-term possibility is becoming the first Australian premier to go on to be governor general. After all, he himself set the precedent for giving that post to a prominent politician by appointing his foreign minister Bill Hayden, instead of the more customary judge or diplomat. In the meantime, however, Hawke is considering turning to hack-work as a television journalist. While intending to stay in parliament at least until next year's election, he is talking to tv networks about doing a series of interviews with present and past world leaders. One obvious candidate is George Bush, who went out of his way to see his friend Bob when in Canberra last month. Another is Margaret Thatcher, whom Hawke respected although didn't like. He apparently has no qualms about becoming a member of a profession he has frequently derided as incompetent, and with which he was increasingly at odds during his last days in office. Nor does he fear attracting one of the writs with which he liberally peppered the Australian media during his 30 years in public life.</p>

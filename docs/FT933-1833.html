			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Agenda switch may aid Smith reform plans A VICTORY for Mr John Smith over some key unions at next week's Labour party conference on the issue of one-member-one-vote for parliamentary selections may depend on procedural manoeuvre. To maximise the chances of Mr Smith's reforms prevailing, the party's national executive is today expected to endorse a plan to switch the debate from Monday, as originally planned, to Wednesday morning. The vote is likely to be extremely close and several union delegations are expected to decide which way to vote at the last moment. The switch means that the debate, and vote, will take place after Mr Smith's set-piece address on the Tuesday of the conference which, Smith supporters hope, will provide another opportunity to sway union delegations. The way in which the vote is taken could also determine the outcome. It seems probable that the various union amendments to the reform proposals tabled by Mr Smith will be taken before the substantive motion on these. Mr Smith's advisers are confident that none of the union amendments - from the TGWU and GMB general unions, Nupe, the public-service union, and the AEEU engineering and electrical union - will muster a majority. If the rule change is taken at the end of the process, then that will increase pressure on some unions to back it. Otherwise the party could be left with no policy at all. That plan could be thwarted by the TGWU. If this union, along with several small leftwing unions, decided to back the GMB amendment after its own fell, that might produce a majority against the reform plan. The AEEU, however, yesterday released figures from a MORI poll which shows that both TGWU and GMB members show above average support among union members for the reforms.</p>

			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A COMMENT ON DORNAN'S COMMENTARY  </P> <P> It is a rare occasion that I am in agreement with Rep. Robert K. Dornan. His  commentary (July 30), however, is something that all open-minded citizens  should support.  </P> <P> Our country is strong because of its mixture of heritages and its "pioneer  spirit." We should remain a symbol for the world to follow even though we  can't, won't or shouldn't try to be the world's policeman.  </P> <P> CRAIG G. MYERS  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

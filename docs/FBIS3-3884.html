			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Taipei, March 24 KYODO -- Taiwan President Li  Teng-hui called Thursday [24 March] for improved ties with  Japan, telling a group of Japanese parliamentarians he wants to  see the Japanese people develop better feelings about their  neighbors to the south.    Members of the inter-party group of eight Japanese  legislators said Li made the remarks in a 45-minute meeting with  them.    The group arrived in Taipei on Tuesday to discuss the issue  of some 452.4 million yen of unsettled debts, including postal  savings deposited by Taiwanese before and during World War II.    Their talks on the issue Wednesday with 18 Taiwan  legislators  headed by Liu Sung-pan, head of the National Assembly, ended  inconclusively.    Li was quoted as thanking the Japanese parliamentarians for  facing the tough issue head-on, despite tough remarks directed  at them by the Taiwanese side.    Such remarks, he said, probably stem from dissatisfaction  with the Japanese Government's "cool" stance towards Taiwan  after Taiwan severed relations with Japan in 1972.    He noted that Taiwan, unlike other former Japanese colonial  possessions, has not brought up with Japan the issue of  compensation for women who were forced to provide sex for  frontline Japanese soldiers during the war.</p>

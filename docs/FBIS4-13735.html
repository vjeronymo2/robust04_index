			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest, April 21 (AFP) -- Israeli Foreign  Minister Shim'on Peres said an accord to launch Palestinian  self-rule was "very near" as he attempted to clear away the  remaining obstacles delaying autonomy in Gaza and Jericho in  talks here Thursday with PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat.    Israeli officials said Peres and 'Arafat discussed the  possibility of a meeting between the PLO leader and Israeli  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, but no more details were given.    In Cairo, where PLO and Israeli negotiators held further  talks Thursday, PLO chief negotiator Nabil Sha'th said Rabin and  'Arafat were expected to sign a final accord on the launch of  Palestinian self-rule in the first week in May.    "It will very probably be between Monday, May 2, and  Wednesday, May 4," Sha'th said. "Rabin and Arafat will meet in  Cairo over two days."    Peres said 'Arafat was "encouraged by the good news" coming  from the Cairo talks.    "We feel we are very near to the conclusion of an agreement"  on autonomy, Peres said.    The PLO and Israel would "try to resume and conclude the  talks as soon as possible," he said, adding that there were  "some remaining issues which are being negotiated in Cairo."    "Both the Palestinians and us are deeply interested in  shortening the transition."    Peres told Israeli radio differences remained over control  of  airspace and territorial waters, jurisdiction in the future  autonomous areas and the Palestinian autonomy council due to  oversee five years of interim self-rule leading up to a final  settlement.    After his first meeting with Arafat in the Romanian capital  Peres also noted differences over economic issues and the  identity papers Palestinians would carry.    Peres and 'Arafat held three sessions of talks, their first  since a Jewish settler slaughtered 30 Palestinians at a Hebron  mosque on February 25 leading the PLO to halt the autonomy talks  for five weeks. They were due to give a joint press conference  at the end of the day.    Romanian officials said they would also have a joint meeting  with Romanian President Ion Iliescu Thursday, before co-chairing  a session of the Crans-Montana Forum, an international  conference on the economic future of the Middle East.    Israel was due to begin a troop withdrawal from Gaza and  Jericho on December 13 and complete it by April 13, but the  handover was delayed by disagreements over security arrangements  and the disruption caused by the Hebron massacre.    On arrival in Bucharest 'Arafat again deplored the fact that  the April 13 deadline had not been kept. However, Peres said he  hoped the pullout would take place "as soon as possible."    After his first session of talks with 'Arafat he said he had  tried to dispel the PLO leader's anxiety about implementation of  the Declaration of Principles signed in Washington last  September.    'Arafat, originally scheduled to leave Bucharest Friday,  will  instead leave Thursday evening because of "an urgent meeting of  the Executive Committee" of the PLO, he said.</p>

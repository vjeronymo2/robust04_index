			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Elmar Guseynov report: "Iraq Will Have To Pay Russia $2 </F> Billion"]    [Excerpts] The UN Reparations Commission has fixed at $40  billion the size of the damages Iraq must pay those who were  affected during its invasion of Kuwait. The amount going to  affected Russian companies is $2 billion. [passage omitted]    As IZVESTIYA was informed at the Russian Ministry of Foreign  Affairs International Organizations Department, our diplomats  have already passed on to the UN Reparations Commission almost  99 percent of all claims on the Russian side. On the whole,  those who sustained losses were former Soviet foreign trade  organizations which lost orders in Kuwait as a result of the  Iraqi invasion. A Foreign Ministry staffer placed special  emphasis on the fact that the claims issue has nothing at all to  do with the problem of Iraqi debts to Russia, which will be  resolved separately and on a bilateral basis.</p>

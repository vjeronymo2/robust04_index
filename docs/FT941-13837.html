			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Record aid programme pledged for LA: National Guard puts up tents and kitchens for 5,000 as concerns over health care grow US government officials mobilised 'the biggest urban aid programme in US history' over the weekend to help victims of the Los Angeles earthquake. The National Guard erected tents and kitchens in parks and playing fields to shelter up to 5,000 homeless people and those afraid to return to their damaged dwellings. Red Cross shelters are housing a further 7,000 people and feeding another 3,000. Health authorities sent teams of doctors and nurses to makeshift camps over the weekend as hospitals reported a growing number of exposure-related illnesses. With many doctors' offices and chemists closed, there is growing concern about health care. Eighteen hospitals in the region have closed all or part of their facilities because of damage and staff shortages. Governor Pete Wilson said yesterday the quake had surpassed Hurricane Andrew, a Dollars 30bn (Pounds 20.2bn) storm, as the costliest natural disaster in US history. As the city was hit by three more sizeable aftershocks, the death toll was reported to have risen to 56. President Bill Clinton announced the release of Dollars 283m (Pounds 191m) to help disaster relief efforts, bringing the total amount of federal aid to Dollars 639m in funds for low-interest loans, Dollars 41m for emergency highway repairs and Dollars 143m in emergency grant funds. This week, an emergency appropriations bill is expected to be presented to Congress seeking additional spending for earthquake repairs. 'Los Angeles will come back. Together with the people of Los Angeles, we'll help to make that happen,' the president said in his weekly radio address on Saturday. By yesterday, over 25,000 people had applied for financial assistance at government emergency aid centres or by telephone. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which last week came under sharp criticism for its inadequate response, said that it would open six additional centres where earthquake victims can apply for housing grants and low-interest loans. Mr Richard Riley, education secretary, said his department 'is fully committed to making sure that we do everything necessary to help restore the Los Angeles schools'. Damage from the earthquake is more widespread than initially thought, officials said. South Central Los Angeles, the site of riots in 1992, has sustained substantial damage. The worst hit areas are to the north, in the San Fernando Valley, and to the west, in Santa Monica. The central business district of Los Angeles emerged largely unscathed. Seismic experts studying the uneven pattern of damage now believe shock waves bounced off the mountains round the San Fernando Valley, exacerbating the impact on some areas and reducing it in others.</p>

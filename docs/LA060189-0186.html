			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> MEET 'MISS JEAN BRODIE,' BUT BEWARE  </P> <P> It's no accident that Jean Brodie counts Mussolini and Franco among her models.  The aging schoolteacher is an eccentric woman with a gift for moving young  minds, but she's also something of a classroom fascist, not above dominating  and manipulating her female students in the name of art and knowledge. She's  not bad, she's just obsessive -- Machiavelli with flash cards, Napoleon with an  eraser.  </P> <P> In "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie" by Jay Presson Allen (based on Muriel  Sparks' novel), we get an up-close and personal view of this unusual woman in  1930s Edinburgh and of the deep, and not always positive, effect she has on her  charges.  </P> <P> At the Westminster Community Theatre, Beth Titus plays Brodie vigorously; we  can feel the verve that such a zealot must possess. When she starts  rhapsodizing about poetry or Giotto's epic canvases, it's not hard to identify  with the students who are enamored of her almost otherworldly spirit and  dedication.  </P> <P> And when Brodie finds how far she's gone astray in her teachings (the death of  a young girl in the Spanish Civil War is the direct result of Brodie's  fanatical yearnings to participate, at least vicariously, in the most important  event of the day), it comes as a shocking contradiction to all that she sees in  herself.  </P> <P> There's an urgency to J.D. Reichelderfer's direction that serves the drama  well. The monochromatic set -- a series of black blocks (designed by  Reichelderfer) that function in various ways, including as classroom desks --  helps to underscore the starkness of Brodie and her relationships.  </P> <P> Besides her students (Dani Ballew, Diane Burland, Laurie Sondag and Marla  Wagner), she's also involved with Gordon (Randy Patterson), a music teacher,  and Teddy (Doug Stauter), a married artist and her chief love. Then there's  Miss McKay (Lynne Tavernetti), the school principal with whom she constantly  clashes. All give satisfying performances.  </P> <P> 'THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE'  </P> <P> A Westminster Community Theatre production of Jay Presson Allen's adaptation of  Muriel Sparks' novel.

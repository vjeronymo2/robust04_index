			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Never mind the public Yesterday's events in the UK new issue market suggest two things: that retail interest in flotations is officially dead and that nobody minds very much. On the one hand, the retail half of Anglian Group's offering was only 6 per cent taken up by the public. On the other, Taunton Cider was placed and underwritten close to the price originally planned, suggesting that the institutions accept there is no longer any point in cutting the price to lure the public in. It may be that the public is being perfectly rational here. The old-style flotation, which fixed the price and then knocked 10 per cent off to get it away, was grossly biased against the vendor. The new book-building method aims at a true market price. But if the stags have grasped that, there seems no point in offering half the issue to the public at all. The result is to leave the public's half with the underwriters, so that the issue is labelled a flop and suffers accordingly in the after-market. In fact, the institutions may simply be underwriting stock as a means of getting a discount on stock they want to hold anyway. For public offerings to go out of fashion would have its ironic aspect. The book-building process was introduced to the UK by the government as a means of controlling the bribe offered to the public in privatisations. In teaching the market how to price issues correctly, the government may have dealt a blow to its own cause of wider share ownership.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sanaa, 17 Mar (INA)--Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid  al-Zindani, member of the Yemeni Presidential Council, has  warned against a foreign and Zionist scheme to partition Yemen  into several statelets in order to make it easier to control its  oil wealth and strategic location, especially the strait of Bab  el Mandeb in the Red Sea.    In statements before Yemeni military units broadcast today,  al-Zindani stressed that the scheme to divide Yemen aims at  establishing several statelets by inciting tribal and sectarian  dissension and paralyzing the state's official institutions in  order to drag the Yemeni people into infighting.    He said this scheme is part of a colonialist course that  targets not just Yemen, but every Arab attempt to forge a better  future in the region. He indicated that anti-Arab foreign  forces do not want to see Arabs and Muslims become capable of  making any advancement and seek to render them desperate about  any chances of progress.    He recalled that the West wagered on fighting among the  parties to the Yemeni coalition immediately after the elections,  especially between the Islamists -- the Yemeni Reform Grouping  -- and the Yemeni Socialist Party.    Al-Zindani revealed that one of the objectives of the  foreign  scheme against Yemen is to control or lease the strait of Bab el  Mandeb and to establish weak statelets. He indicated that when  the Yemenis are unified and strong, foreign powers find it  extremely difficult to impose their humiliating conditions.    The statements by al-Zindani, who is a prominent member of  the Yemeni Reform Grouping under Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn  al-Ahmar, are part of the warnings that the grouping issued to  the General People's Congress and the Yemeni Socialist Party on  the gravity of the continued crisis and its effects on the  future of Yemen's unity.</p>

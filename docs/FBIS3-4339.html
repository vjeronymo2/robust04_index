The poll found that respondents believed products from the  United States, Japan and Germany topped other countries in terms  of product quality, followed by Mainland China, Taiwan and  Central American nations.    "This rating flies in the face of international praise for  Taiwan products," Stan Shih, chairman of the Brand International  Promotion Association told reporters after reading the poll  results.    Shih said the poll was conducted by the US-based Gallup  Organization and divided responses into three areas, North  America, South America and the rest of the world.    The arbitrary division may have influenced the survey  outcome, Shih said.    "Those surveyed from countries with poor educational  standards may have confused Taiwan with Thailand or thought of  Taiwan as part of Mainland China," he added.    Secretary-General Huang Hsing-kuo of the private Foreign  Trade Association explained that the low product quality rating  also may have resulted from a high number of survey responses  from India and Latin America.    "Taiwan product promotion efforts target the US and Europe  and not other areas of the globe," Huang explained.    "As a result, Americans and Europeans are well aware that  Taiwan products are of the highest quality, but people from  other countries may not know this," he added.</p>

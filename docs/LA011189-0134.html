			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUNICIPAL JUDGES DECIDE TO ACCEPT STATE FUNDING  </P> <P> After several months of negotiations with county administrators, the county's  municipal judges voted Tuesday to join a new state program for financing court  operations.  </P> <P> The County Board of Supervisors is expected to give final approval for county  participation in the program, set up under the state's Trial Court Funding Act,  at its meeting today. The county's Superior Court judges voted last month to  join the program.  </P> <P> Under the program, the county is to receive about $9 million in the next 6  months that it needs to avert a budget crisis. The courts will get an  additional $3.5 million, including money for five new Superior Court  judgeships.  </P> <P> The county's troubled budget got another needed boost Monday when the county  retirement board agreed to a bailout that will save the county about $8 million  in the current fiscal year.  </P> <P> County officials said it is now unlikely that layoffs or program cutbacks will  be necessary. But a hiring freeze the supervisors adopted last month will be  maintained.  </P> <P> Under the Trial Court Funding Act, which was intended to bail out financially  strapped counties statewide, the state will assume much of the cost of  operating the courts. But before the county could join the program, an  agreement for disbursing the state funds had to be reached with all the  county's judges.  </P> <P> The Superior Court will get five new judges and clerical staff to serve them.  The Municipal Court will get more than 60 new clerical positions. The judges  will also be granted the same retirement benefits given to Superior Court  judges.  </P> <P> In addition, the marshal's office was given $406,000 for new positions; the  court clerk's office received $275,000.  </P></p>

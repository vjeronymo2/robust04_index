			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Fare fears shunt railway funding to the fore: Sell-off critics are making much mileage out of plans for Network SouthEast ACCUSATIONS and counter-accusations continued to fly yesterday over leaked plans for 16 per cent fare increases in British Rail's Network SouthEast region. While the leak has been interpreted as an attempt to provide further bad publicity for the government's plans to privatise the railways, the problems revealed highlight Network SouthEast's continuing funding problems, regardless of any change of ownership. They increase the pressure on Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, to decide on funding priorities for transport. The scale of the increases outlined in the leaked document has alarmed many Tory MPs in the south-east. Local elections in the London boroughs next May - the Tories are already braced to do badly in them - will add to the political sensitivity of the decisions on fares. Parliament has still to complete its discussion of the rail privatisation legislation. Further debates in October will give dissatisfied Tories an opportunity to press for concessions. Network SouthEast says that Pounds 460m is needed annually until the end of the decade 'simply to maintain the status quo'. This would allow for replacing outdated rolling stock and essential maintenance, but would not include extra routes or rolling stock. Project investment for next year has been funded at Pounds 420m, according to Network SouthEast, leaving a Pounds 40m shortfall. The Department of Transport refused to confirm or deny the authenticity of the discussion documents, which were leaked to the environmental pressure group Transport 2000. But it was clear that many proposals for Network SouthEast had already been floated by policymakers, and officials said that no clear decisions had yet been taken. Three options are suggested in the documents. All are aimed at keeping within the government's 'Rail Plan' financial targets for British Rail, and do not take into account any extra costs caused by privatisation. They also involve rectifying shortfalls for the current financial year, and do not therefore affect the next Autumn Statement on total government expenditure in November. They are: The 'preferred' plan of a 16.2 per cent rise in price for Travelcards, used on rail, Underground and buses in Greater London, coupled with a 12 per cent increase for standard single-day fares and a 7.9 per cent rise for season tickets. A 'first alternative', with Travelcards raised by 10.3 per cent, season tickets by 8.5 per cent and single-day fares by 12 per cent. A 'second alternative' in which Travelcards would be increased by a relatively modest 6.3 per cent, season tickets by 6 per cent and standard day fares by 8.0 per cent. The 'first alternative', according to the notes leaked to Transport 2000, has been framed with the London borough elections in mind, as fare increases would be lower in the capital. The 'second alternative', which would be most politically acceptable, fails to raise enough revenue to meet the Rail Plan targets. This would leave the network with the problem of underfunding and investment would need to be cut further in an attempt to meet the targets, according to the leaked documents. The framework for the discussions between British Rail and the Department of Transport was set by the tough spending settlement in last November's public spending statement, which saw a slender increase in the grants for British Rail from Pounds 1.36bn to Pounds 1.49bn. Spending on roads was left unscathed at more than Pounds 2bn a year for three years. Network SouthEast defended itself against criticisms of service quality, and said that a recent survey had shown it to be ahead of the French SNCF's Paris service by 7.8 per cent on measures of reliability and punctuality. It admitted, however, that it received a Pounds 300m government grant last year, and even when this was included made a surplus of only Pounds 5m. This apparent profit was chiefly attributable to a change in accounting conventions, it said. In preceding years it had consistently returned a loss, according to Department of Transport figures, of Pounds 154.9m in 1990-91 - when total government subsidies to the British Rail network were Pounds 700m  - and of Pounds 138.1m in 1989-90 - when total subsidies were Pounds 635m. Mr Stephen Joseph, director of Transport 2000, said: 'The government is facing quite severe choices. They have to decide on transport priorities, and whether they divert money to road or to rail. 'How that is affected by privatisation is unclear.'</p>

			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Japan company failures decline Japanese corporate collapses may be diminishing, according to the latest bankruptcy figures. Defunct companies left Y398.8bn (Pounds 2.54bn) worth of debts last month, down 61 per cent from November 1993, Teikoku Databank, a credit research agency, said yesterday. Much of that big year-on-year drop is artificial, due to the fact that November last year saw Japan's biggest recorded corporate collapse, that of Osaka-based Muramoto Construction, with debts of Y590bn. Bankruptcy debt also declined in the month from October to November this year, by 52.8 per cent, though the October figure was also unusually high, due to the Y518.5bn collapse of Nippon Mortgage, a medium-sized non-bank financial institution. The number of companies to collapse rose by 1.6 per cent to 1,195 in the year to last month, but fell by 2.5 per cent from October to November. Construction continues to be hard hit, with a 15.7 per cent year on year rise in bankruptcies, while collapses in manufacturing industry were almost stable - a 0.8 per cent rise. In another piece of moderately good news for the economy, department store sales fell by 0.6 per cent in November, the smallest decline in the 33 consecutive months during which sales have fallen.</p>

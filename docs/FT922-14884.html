			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / The Property Market: Strategic choices London's planning regime is once again on the political agenda. Rarely has the overhaul of the capital's planning system seemed so necessary. Consider, for instance, three decisions taken in the past two weeks. This week the London Docklands Development Corporation (LDDC) gave permission for Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian developer, to build another 3.2m sq ft of offices at Heron Quay, next to Canary Wharf. Yet the need for these offices is unproven. There is already 34m sq ft of vacant office space in London and 33m sq ft of offices are under construction or seeking planning approval in the Dockland's enterprise zone alone. O&amp;Y's ability to undertake the scheme is also in doubt at a time when it is seeking a restructuring of its Dollars 20bn debt. The problems of Canary Wharf, which is 40 per cent unlet, highlight a more general point about the Dockland's laissez-faire planning policy. Tenants have been deterred by the delayed introduction of adequate infrastructure and the lack of thought that has gone into making the area a pleasant place to live and work. Critics also argue that the sweeping planning powers of the LDDC have prevented discussion of alternative uses for the land. 'There exists a desperate need for other uses for the land: schemes for social housing, child-care and training provision and local employment,' says the Docklands consultative committee, an association of Labour-led local authorities. Proposals to redevelop a former goods yard at Kings Cross, the largest inner-city site in Europe, remain in the balance, after four years of negotiations. The local authority, Camden, met last week to consider the decision of its chief planning officer that a 10.3m sq ft planning application provided 'the basis for an acceptable scheme', given certain conditions. But hopes for a swift decision were dashed. Although Camden's planning committee says it wants a settlement, it first wants further negotiations and assurances on the viability of the scheme. 'What this unhappy saga illustrates is the total inability of our planning system to determine applications within a reasonable amount of time,' says Mr Mark Fisher, Labour's shadow arts minister, in his book on London's future* co-written with architect Sir Richard Rogers. After lying empty for several years, County Hall, the home of the Greater London Council, was sold last week to a Japanese developer which plans to turn it into a hotel; the deal, however, will not be completed until Autumn next year. Labour, which has pledged to reverse the sale, says the announcement of the deal, just days before the UK general election, was provocative. However, the deal invites parallels with the GLC's own highly controversial transfer of land at Coin Street on the south bank of the River Thames to community builders - just before the Tory government abolished the London authority in 1986. The future of County Hall is the most politically-charged planning issue of them all, since a Labour government would use part of the building for its proposed Greater London Authority, which would be in charge of strategic planning across the capital. The very idea of strategic planning for London is controversial. The concept is disliked in principle by those who think that London's character stems from the haphazard way it has evolved over the decades. The drawing up of a strategic plan itself poses many practical problems, says the Conservative party. 'When the GLC drew up its strategic master plan for London, it took 11 years and was out of date by the time it was finished,' says the party's manifesto for London. On the issue of the relaxed planning conditions in Docklands, the Tory party strongly defends its action, stating that this was essential to revive the area. 'Between them, the GLC and the east end London boroughs effectively frustrated any attempt to bring life and investment back to the declining Docklands,' the manifesto states. The case in favour of strategic planning is three-fold. First, boroughs are reluctant to turn down commercial propositions, even bad ones, for fear of losing the jobs that come with the project. Second, initiatives that could benefit the whole city are neglected, if they inconvenience the borough concerned. Third, and perhaps most important, immense amounts of time, money and effort are wasted because each proposal stirs up fundamental issues about the shape and character of the capital. 'Opportunities have been lost and overseas investors have been discouraged,' says Hillier Parker, the chartered surveyors, citing schemes such as King's Cross and County Hall which have both been involved in lengthly planning battles. Advocates of strategic planning dismiss the charge that such a concept would be unwieldy in practice by citing the examples of Barcelona, Paris and Rotterdam (see other article), which have introduced comprehensive plans to redevelop run-down city areas. 'What these cities demonstrate is that it is possible to draw up strategic plans and realise them,' says Mr Fisher. *A New London. Richard Rogers and Mark Fisher.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Haydari and Faysal Makram from Sanaa, </F> and Iqbal 'Ali 'Abdallah from Aden]    [Excerpt] Yesterday, the Yemeni crisis witnessed a series  of developments indicating an escalation. Reliable sources in  Sanaa have reported that Presidential Council Chairman  Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih informed the Political  Forces Dialogue Committee that the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]  is floating a "new plan" that calls for the deployment of  Egyptian troops between the northern Yemeni and southern Yemeni  troops in the former border areas.    These sources added that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih was informed  of  the new YSP plan by Egyptian Assistant Foreign Minister  Ambassador Badr Hammam, who also met with YSP leaders in Aden,  including 'Ali Salim al-Bid, secretary general of the YSP  Central Committee and vice chairman of the Presidential Council.    Sources close to the General People's Congress said that it  was Yemeni Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas who relayed  the "new plan" to the Egyptian mediator. The sources added that  the Presidential Council chairman expressed his strong  dissatisfaction with the new plan, noting that it was only  promoted by a minority within the YSP higher command, the  majority of which cherishes unity. President Salih noted that  this plan would return the country to the situation that  prevailed before the merger unity of 22 May 1990.    In a separate development, and in a meeting with members of  the Political Forces Dialogue Committee, the Yemeni president  has denied that his country is importing banned weapons, saying:  "Regardless of the differences in perspective we might have, we  must resort to dialogue. We should not undermine national  constants. Our unity must remain intact. It is better for us  to come to the negotiating table to reach understanding and find  solutions to our problems and hurdles before the onset of any  armed conflicts or violence. This is because the failure to do  so would result in bloodshed, devastation, and ruination  throughout the homeland." [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / CIS hopes for energy charter MEMBERS of the Commonwealth of Independent States are counting on the European energy charter to sort out the growing number of energy-related disputes in the former Soviet Union, a senior EC official said yesterday. But Mr Clive Jones, secretary general of the Energy Charter Conference, warned that it would take time to reach agreement on the legally binding treaty which will lay out legal safeguards for energy investment across central and eastern Europe. Mr Jones, who met CIS electricity ministers last month, said they were strongly behind the energy charter. Many are likely to be given extra time to implement the charter's disciplines. Meanwhile, it was 'essential for the implementation of the market regime that (CIS members) bring their prices up to world levels'. The charter itself was signed in December, but its implementation depends on the 47 signatories producing a binding 'basic agreement' which will put its principles into practice.</p>

			<p><P> July 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The space shuttle Columbia rolled closer to the launching pad and its secret  mission for the Pentagon. Hours before dawn, workers at Kennedy Space Center in  Florida towed America's oldest orbiter into the huge Vehicle Assembly Building  from a hangar where it has spent most of the last 3 1/2 years. Workers were to  attach the fuel tank and twin booster rockets that will propel Columbia into  space on its first mission since Jan. 10, 1986 -- the last flight before the  Challenger disaster grounded the fleet. The shuttle is scheduled to make its  eight-hour, four-mile crawl to the Kennedy Space Center launching pad Sunday.  </P></p>

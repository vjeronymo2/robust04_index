			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / UK Company News: David Brown warns on margins David Brown Group, the Yorkshire-based specialist engineer which came to the market last year, yesterday reported strong growth in sales and exports, but warned that scope for margin improvement was limited. The shares, which had fallen steeply ahead of the announcement, closed 13p up at 213p. Pre-tax profits rose 22 per cent to Pounds 6.04m for the six months to July 29. Sales grew 59 per cent to Pounds 59.7m - thanks partly to a full contribution from the hydraulics and transmissions division of Hamworthy, bought from Powell Duffryn for Pounds 11.1m last November, Mr Chris Cook, joint chief executive, said margins had been squeezed by tough trading conditions and the absorption of the less profitable Hamworthy businesses, although they were now all trading profitably and ahead of budget. Mr Cook said the group had responded to the dearth of UK capital projects by improving its overseas sales and distribution efforts. Partly because of the Hamworthy deal, the proportion of group sales made overseas increased from 36 to 54 per cent. Mr Derek Kingsbury, chairman, said: 'With our success in developing export sales and each of the divisions currentlyshowing an order book higher than 12 months ago, the outlook for sales growth is becoming more encouraging.' The closure of the Hamworthy plant in Poole, Dorset, involved 170 redundancies, but Mr Cook said he hoped further integration would be achieved without further job losses. Vehicle transmissions, the biggest division, showed substantial growth in sales and operating profit following the integration of the Hamworthy axles and rail gearbox businesses, together with a strong performance from the recently developed specialist commercial vehicle activities. Mr Chris Brown, joint chief executive, said the recent confirmation by the Ministry of Defence that it would buy a further 259 Challenger 2 tanks from Vickers meant that David Brown's military products business would be making transmissions for the tanks until 1999. Earnings per share rose 3 per cent to 6.7p (6.5p). Mr Cook said the earnings increase would have been 7 per cent, but for a Pounds 250,000 bad debt incurred following the collapse of Lancer Boss. The interim dividend is lifted to 2.25p (2.1p).</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Bonn and Paris Step Up Cooperation"] </F>   [Text] Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Francois  Mitterrand were due to meet in Mulhouse on Monday 30 and Tuesday  31 May for the 63d Franco-German summit. This meeting will make  it possible to prepare for the European Council meeting in Corfu  on 24 and 25 June, the G-7 summit in Naples on 8 and 9 July, and  the German and French terms as president of the European Union  [EU] which will take place in succession from 1 July. Elysee  [office of the French president] spokesman Jean Musitelli  confirmed the creation of "a high-level working group which  would have the task...of ensuring full consultation between our  two countries."    German Government spokesman Dieter Vogel also confirmed that  Paris and Bonn planned to combine their efforts to make their  respective presidencies of the EU a success for Europe. "We may  assume that the major squalls are behind us," Mr. Musitelli  stressed, referring to the crisis in the European Monetary  System, the GATT negotiations, and to the "uncertainties linked  with the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty and the problems  of expansion to include four new members."    In addition, in an interview published by L'ALSACE and the  BADISCHES ZEITUNG, Francois Mitterrand explained that he did not  see "why and how Europe's `center of gravity' should shift  following the expansion" of the EU: "Look at a map of Europe:  Germany and France have never been more `central' in every sense  of the term."</p>

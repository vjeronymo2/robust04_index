			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Investor complaints fall - But Norma Cohen finds cause for worry in ombudsman's report For private investors, the report of the investment ombudsman, Richard Youard, this week is cause for both confidence and worry. For confidence, read the statistics. The number of cases handled by his office - which deals with complaints against money managers - fell by 29 per cent in the 1993/94 year to 73. Better yet, according to Youard, there was a marked decrease in the number of 'vehement comments' once a decision was reached and the case settled. But the report does point to some worrying trends for private investors and suggests that, on balance, there is great danger in allowing reasonable standards of vigilance to lapse. Youard himself argues against too much vigilance by investors; taping every conversation with an adviser is probably going too far, he says. Nevertheless, he recalls the story of one investor who took the precaution of placing a tape recorder behind the sofa. When the sales agent was confronted with the tape, 'he admitted that he actually did not realise that share prices could go down as well as up'. Youard notes that one particular area of growing concern is the 'income from capital' product where investors may not understand that their initial capital investment is being depleted in order to provide a regular monthly income. 'It is clear from the cases we have seen that investors instinctively assume that if the money they receive is described as 'income', it is not coming from capital or, at the very least, will in no way give rise to a reduction in their original capital,' the report says. 'In fact, this is far from the case in many of the schemes which have been adopted, and new schemes emerge every year.' Youard points also to two areas where investors' interests may be damaged even though they remain unaware of it. One was the propensity of some investment managers to place clients in their own unit trusts, even when those were performing poorly compared with rival funds. 'We have found a pretty cavalier attitude in some organisations about the choice of unit trusts,' he says, singling out banks as the main culprits in this area. A second was the unit trust manager who, after launching a new product, decided investor interest had been too little and that the vehicle should be altered or scrapped. In such cases, says Youard, investors should not have to bear the charges associated with selecting and buying a replacement. Overall, Youard believes the IO scheme is working well. But with the new Personal Investment Authority soon to start work - along with its own ombudsman scheme - some investors may be worse off. While the IO can award compensation of up to Pounds 100,000, the PIA claims will have a Pounds 50,000 ceiling. For the retired shopkeeper who puts the proceeds of selling his business into a single, wrong investment, Pounds 50,000 is probably too low a ceiling. 'These people will not have the liquid resources to fight their claims through the courts,' Youard notes. The Office of the Investment Ombudsman, 6 Frederick's Place, London EC2R 8BT.

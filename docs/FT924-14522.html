			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Lord Moore to head 'green' energy trust LORD MOORE, the former cabinet minister, will be appointed within two weeks as first chairman of the new Energy Saving Trust, one of the main planks in the government's environmental policy. His appointment ends a long hunt by the Department of the Environment for a suitable candidate. The DoE has been criticised for the slow progress in setting up the trust, which featured prominently in the Conservative general election manifesto and in the government's statement in Rio at the Earth Summit in June. The trust, a limited company, was founded to identify energy-efficiency projects in which British Gas and regional electricity companies will invest. It is one of several proposals to help the UK meet internationally agreed targets for reducing emissions of potentially harmful gases. The trust will consider whether the costs of those investments should be passed on to gas and electricity customers, which is ultimately the decision of Offer and Ofgas, the industry regulators. The delay in finding a chairman stalled the first three pilot projects that British Gas was contemplating a year ago before its plans became subsumed in proposals for the trust. It will now be possible to appoint a board of directors that will include representatives of British Gas and the electricity companies, as well as a majority of non-utility directors. Lord Moore of Lower Marsh, once tipped as a possible successor to Margaret Thatcher, left the political spotlight in 1988 when, as social security minister, he became embroiled in the row over NHS reforms. He had previously been a minister at the Department of Energy and later financial secretary of the Treasury, where he was a vigorous free-market proponent. He is now executive chairman of the fund management arm of Credit Suisse. The government hopes to keep the UK's emissions of carbon dioxide to within 157m-179m tons by the year 2000, compared to 160m in 1990, the Department of Trade and Industry said yesterday. The range reflects a number of developments in recent years, including new proposals for more efficient gas-fired electricity generation, and improvements in energy efficiency. It also reflects different assumptions about both the level and structure of economic activity and about energy prices.</p>

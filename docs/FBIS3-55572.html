You will agree that against a background abounding with examples  of the failure to oblige or to display assiduity, including on  questions of state importance, this appears encouraging.    I will remind you that it was planned to form the Russian  Armed Forces in three stages, over six or maybe even eight  years. In particular, at the first stage (during 1992) it was  proposed:    -- to create the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense;    -- to create the legal basis of the building and functioning  of the Armed Forces;    -- to elaborate the structure, combat composition, and  groupings of the Armed Forces;    -- to withdraw to Russia's territory the troops under its  jurisdiction;    -- to complete the formation of administrative agencies of  the Armed Forces.    The creation of the Defense Ministry was the priority area  in  all this work in 1992. As is known, the Russian Federation  president approved the statute on it 27 July. By that time (the  end of July) the elaboration of the structures of the Armed  Forces for the next few years and the longer term was  practically complete, the complexion of the ministry itself had  been decided, and the basis of the concept of the organizational  development of the Armed Forces had been drawn up.    In addition, a thorough and objective stocktaking of  existing  arms and hardware was carried out in 1992. The status of the  Russian troops stationed outside the country was decided at an  interstate level. In addition to their withdrawal to Russian  territory, there was a planned reduction in the numbers of  personnel, arms, and military hardware. The fundamentals of the  legal basis of the organizational development and functioning of  the Armed Forces were also drawn up. In August 1992 the Ural  Military District was reinstated, the reforming of a number of  other districts was begun....    Thus, by the end of the first stage of the formation of the  Russian Armed Forces we already had quite a clear idea of their  structure and, most importantly, we had bodies capable of  administering them. At the same time the Defense Ministry's new  structure is fundamentally different from the previous one.  Above all, in terms of a clearer demarcation of functions  within the central apparatus, which by November 1992 had been  reduced by more than 30 percent (approximately 6,000 people).  Some 140 generals' posts, 41 directorates, and 140 departments  and sectors had been abolished. Directorates of the high  commands of troops of sectors, of the Turkestan Military  District, of two armies of the Transcaucasus Military District,  and of several divisions and military schools had also ceased to  exist. By the end of the year the strength of the Armed Forces  as a whole had fallen by more than 200,000 men.    As we have already told our readers, the tasks at the second  stage (1993-1994) of the formation of the Russian Armed Forces  are:    -- to complete, in the main, the withdrawal of Russian  troops  from other territories;    -- to reduce and reform the troops (forces) and to create a  military infrastructure on Russian territory;    -- to create and enshrine in legislation a system of social  guarantees for servicemen, members of their families, and  persons discharged from military service into the reserve or  into retirement (including ahead of schedule);    -- to go over to a mixed system of manning the Army and Navy  with personnel;    -- to introduce alternative service.    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA's readers have been informed about the way  these tasks were resolved in 1993. With the withdrawal of  troops from East European countries, as is known, the first  strategic defense echelon of the former Soviet Union ceased to  exist. Troops of the second echelon have pulled back to Ukraine  and Belarus, and their withdrawal from the Baltic region is  continuing. As a result, military districts which had been  internal -- Moscow, Leningrad, and North Caucasus -- have become  border districts. The Ural and Volga Military Districts are  becoming a base for the preparation of mobilization resources  and a basis for creating a new operational-strategic formation.    The withdrawal of Russian troops from other territories will  continue this year. In particular, it is planned to withdraw  250,000 servicemen and approximately 120,000 units of diverse  hardware from the Western and Northwestern Groups of Forces, the  Transcaucasus, and the Baltic countries. It is proposed that  this process can be completed before 1 September.    In connection with the aforementioned changes in the  military-strategic situation and the troop withdrawal the work  on creating troop groupings and a military infrastructure on  Russian territory, on improving their organization and  establishment, and on equipping them with modern hardware and  armament will naturally be continued.    Consequently, groupings of conventional armed forces will  essentially be created anew on Russian territory before 1995.  At the same time there is to be a sharp reduction in the  overall number of large strategic formations and combined units.  In the opinion of experts, the groupings which are being  created will be capable of repulsing aggression in local and  regional wars and military conflicts. In the event of a  large-scale war being unleashed, they will be capable of  ensuring the strategic deployment of the Armed Forces. The  existing structures of the Armed Forces (Strategic Missile  Forces, Ground Forces, Air Defense Forces, Air Force, Navy) and  the way the Russian Federation's territory is divided up from  military-administrative perspective will be preserved for the  time being.    The priority tasks for 1994 include the creation of mobile  forces capable of quickly being transferred, being deployed, and  conducting mobile combat operations in any direction and in any  region where a threat to Russia's military security arises.    It cannot be ruled out that that the arrnagements for and  planning of the organizational development of the Armed Forces  will be determined more precisely, taking account of the state  system of planning that is taking shape and economic and other  realities.    The switch to the mixed method of manning the Army and Navy  began in 1993. According to General Staff data, contract  servicemen already hold one post in every seven among those  manned by privates, sergeants, and petty officers. This year  they are to make up 30 percent of the Armed Forces' total  personnel strength. Posts which determine the combat  effectiveness of units and ships and also troops fulfilling  peacemaking functions will primarily be manned by specialists  volunteering for military service under contract. Naturally,  the quality of this contingent will largely depend on those who  recruit volunteers and, in particular, on their ability to  prevent persons whose moral and professional qualities are poor  from finding their way into the military.    At the same time the continuation of the policy of  professionalizing the Army will require the allocation of new  targeted budget appropriations, the drawing up of new normative  acts, etc.    In general, in terms of the organizational development of  the  Armed Forces, 1994 will be remarkable for the fact that we  already have a practically full "military package" of laws,  right down to the general military regulations. The "Main  Provisions of the Russian Federation's Military Doctrine,"  adopted at the end of last year, make the work of shaping the  Armed Forces still more focused not only in the political and  strictly military respects, but also as regards  military-technical and economic aspects. All this certainly  does not mean, however, that the new parliament no longer has  anything to do in the sphere of military legislation. Rather,  on the contrary, life is posing more and more new tasks here.  These include, incidentally, the introduction of alternative  service planned for the second stage of shaping the Armed Forces.</p>

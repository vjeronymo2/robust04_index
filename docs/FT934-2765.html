			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Where accountants can meet Sonic  -David Carter discovers a bargain PC which is ideal for small business users and their children / Computing Earlier this year, Amstrad introduced the Mega PC, designed for small business users who want to do their accounts and correspondence at home and relax during the evenings by playing a computer game or two. The advertising trumpets it as ' . . . the best of both worlds, a fully featured IBM-compatible PC and a Sega Megadrive-compatible console - all in one superbly engineered unit'. Sales were slow, but the price has been reduced from Pounds 999, first to Pounds 699, then recently down to Pounds 426 plus VAT. My eight-year old son gave the thumbs up to the Sega Megadrive, but I was mainly interested in business applications. For some time now I have been looking for a cheap demonstration machine which I can take round to prospective customers. With a 386SX, 25 MHz processor, one megabyte of RAM and a 40 megabyte disk, the Mega PC makes an ideal small business computer. The great attraction of the Mega PC is the price. I looked through the PC magazines but could not find anything near Pounds 426. There are one or two PCs at Pounds 699 plus VAT, but most are at least double the Mega's price. I rang my local Ryman's Computer Store and asked if they stocked the Mega PC: 'No sir, it's not powerful enough for a business machine. It's only suitable for games.' Dixon's told me the Mega PC was not available at all stores but they would be able to get hold of one for me. If they could not, what was their cheapest off-the-shelf machine? A PC with 486SX/25 MHz chip, 100 megabytes of disk, and four megabytes of RAM at Pounds 940: nearly twice the price of the Amstrad. The PC magazines give the impression that the minimum configuration for a PC these days is a 486SX/25 MHz processor, four megabytes of RAM, and a 100 megabyte disk drive. This is tosh. I have plenty of customers running their businesses quite happily on a PC with a 286 processor and a 20 megabyte disk. So what's going on? The answer lies in one word: Windows. My customers running their businesses on a 286 are working under the DOS operating system. Windows - the 'Graphical User Interface' which Microsoft has added on to DOS - demands an enormous amount of machine power. So, while a 286 processor under simple DOS will give you instant response, to get the same speed with Windows, you need a vastly more powerful, and hence more expensive machine, such as a 486SX. Obviously, it is in the interest of manufacturers and retailers to persuade the public that they must have leading-edge technology running under Windows and a load of powerful and expensive machinery to run it. But the simple fact is that they do not. The key benefit of Windows is in producing on-screen design work. If you produce reports which need to look good and to impress, or you need to produce complex documents which combine text, graphs and illustrations, Windows is great. But if you simply want to produce one-page business letters or to run your accounts, the two principal reasons for which small businesses buy computers, Windows is unnecessary. Indeed the tendency of Windows' to short-circuit (in the jargon, to 'crash') makes it an unsuitable platform to run a 'mission-critical' application such as accounting. If your machine crashes at the wrong time you may corrupt the entire accounting database. For this reason Windows has made negligible inroads into the accounting marketplace (a recent survey by consultants Tate Bramald and the Institute of Certified Accountants found fewer than 1 per cent of companies use a Windows package to run their accounts). The basic Mega PC comes with the DOS operating system, but you will need to buy a software package or two to run on it. TAS Books (Pounds 99 from Megatech, 081-874-6511) is a good accounts package, or for the non-accountant there is Quicken for DOS (Pounds 42.51 from Intuit 0800-585058). I would also go for a cheap 'integrated' package combining word processor, spreadsheet and database. The best, and the one I give my customers, is Microsoft Works Version 3 for DOS (mail order price about Pounds 89.95 from Computers by Post, 081-760-0014). But Works presupposes considerable prior knowledge of computer concepts. PFS First Choice is less sophisticated and therefore easier to learn (Pounds 76.50 with PFS First Publisher from Best Buys 0800-317307). Prices exclude postage and VAT . You may have to shop around for an Amstrad Mega PC. It is available from retail chains such as Tandy, Comet, Tempo, and some branches of Dixons. Alternatively try mail order suppliers such as P &amp; P (071-265-4570) or Evesham Micros (0386-765500).</p>

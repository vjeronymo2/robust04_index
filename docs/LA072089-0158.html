			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FEAR OF FLYING: HYDRAULIC LOSS IS ONE OF WORST  </P> <P> The "complete hydraulic failure" reported by the pilot of doomed United  Airlines Flight 232 is one of the most feared events in flying, rendering even  a sophisticated three-engine jet like the DC-10 virtually uncontrollable.  </P> <P> The wide-bodied DC-10 has three independent hydraulic systems that operate all  the plane's control surfaces on its wings and tail, its landing gear and its  brakes.  </P> <P> A failure of all three hydraulic systems is "rare, rare, rare," said John  Gallipault, director of the private Aviation Safety Institute in Worthington,  Ohio. "Design engineers calculate that to happen something like once every 300  years."  </P> <P> Gallipault, like several other aviation experts interviewed, cautioned that  preliminary reports on air crashes are almost invariably incomplete or marred  by errors and said that other factors likely would emerge as contributing to  the disaster.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Manufacturer's Warning  </P> <P> The aircraft's manufacturer, McDonnell Douglas Corp., warns pilots that failure  of even one hydraulic system can lead to disaster.  </P> <P> "Careful consideration should be given to continuation of a flight after loss  of a single hydraulic system, keeping in mind that subsequent loss of a second  system -- through system or engine failure -- may create a serious emergency  situation," the operating manual for the DC-10 says.  </P> <P> According to one unidentified survivor of the crash, the pilot told passengers  that "one of our engines had blown and quit. He said when it blew it hurt the  tail of the plane and the pilots couldn't control the plane."  </P> <P> Federal Aviation Administration spokesman John Leyden said the pilot reported  "uncontained failure" of the jet's No. 2 engine, in the plane's tail, meaning  that the engine blew apart and sent shards of metal through the tail section,  where several critical hydraulic components are housed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reduces Control  </P> <P> According to the DC-10 manual, loss of the hydraulic system driven by the tail  engine would render the lower half of the rudder inoperative, making steering  difficult. It also would reduce control of the flaps at the rear surface of the  wings, making it hard for the pilot to slow the big jet for a safe landing.  </P> <P> But backup systems operating off the two wing-mounted engines should have made  the plane flyable, experts said.  </P> <P> A civil aviation expert who asked not to be named theorized that the No. 2  engine failed "catastrophically" -- blowing apart and severing all the  hydraulic lines in the tail of the plane. That would disable the entire  steering rudder as well as the critical flaps in the horizontal stabilizer,  which allow the pilot to raise or lower the jet's nose.  </P> <P> The pilot could then use the two remaining wing engines to steer the plane and  slow it with flaps and spoilers on the wings operated with hydraulic power  provided by the two remaining engines, the expert, a former military transport  pilot, said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Incredibly Tricky'  </P> <P> But controlling the big airliner under those conditions is "incredibly tricky,"  he said, and the pilot may not have been able to raise the nose as he attempted  to land.  </P> <P> "He has a machine which is very difficult to get pointed to the right place,"  the expert said after hearing descriptions of the crash. "He came pretty close  to getting it landed. But the plane may have rolled slightly on him, and he dug  in a wing tip."  </P> <P> It is possible, also, that the main hydraulic fluid reservoir, also in the rear  of the plane, was destroyed when the No. 2 engine blew, virtually assuring  complete loss of all hydraulic power.  </P> <P> "Complete hydraulic failure was something he radioed and demonstrated, too,"  Leyden, the FAA official, said. "But we can't speculate on exactly how much  control he had or what happened up there. All we know is he had a very, very  difficult time controlling the aircraft."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Power Steering Loss  </P> <P> An Eastern Airlines pilot, who asked not to be named, said that losing a  DC-10's hydraulic system would be similar to having the power steering go out  in a car. A pilot in that situation, he said, would find it virtually  impossible to control the direction of the aircraft and efforts to slow it for  landing would be extremely sensitive.  </P> <P> "If you see your hydraulic pressure tanks go to zero and the lights and buzzers  going off, you have to stabilize the aircraft," said the pilot. "You don't do  anything to destabilize the aircraft, like pulling back on the power. You try  to maintain the normal flight and get all the time you can and look for a big  runway with crash crews."  </P> <P> After past DC-10 crashes, critics have said that design features of the plane  have made it particularly vulnerable to catastrophic hydraulic failures. But  McDonnell Douglas has said that design changes have solved those problems.  </P> <P> Hydraulic system failures have been key elements in many of the worst air  crashes of the past two decades. In most cases, the failure of some portion of  the plane set off a series of events that burst hydraulic lines, causing the  pilot to lose control of the plane.  </P> <P> For example, on May 25, 1979, an American Airlines DC-10, the same type of  plane involved in Wednesday's disaster, crashed on takeoff at Chicago's O'Hare  Airport, killing 271 persons on the plane and two more on the ground.  </P> <P> Investigators later determined that the crash was caused when an engine on the  plane's left wing ripped loose, damaging hydraulic lines that controlled the  left wing flaps. The plane lunged to the left and slammed into the ground 31  seconds after leaving the runway.  </P> <P> Similarly, in August, 1985, in the worst single-plane accident in history, an  aft bulkhead ruptured on a Japan Airlines 747 jumbo jet, releasing pressure  that buckled other portions of the plane, severing hydraulic lines and causing  the plane to go out of control and fly into a mountainside. All but four of 524  persons on board died.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Accident Over Paris  </P> <P> In an earlier DC-10 crash, in 1974, a Turkish Airlines DC-10 crashed killing  346 persons on board after it lost a cargo door over Paris. The explosive  decompression of the plane buckled the floor, rupturing key hydraulic systems,  investigators later found.  </P> <P> Hydraulic-system failures have also caused disastrous crashes for the  military's high-technology aircraft.  </P> <P> On Jan. 21, 1988, a $280-million Air Force B1-B bomber crashed after a large  bird, probably a pelican, collided with the plane as it streaked through the  air at 600 m.p.h. The collision ruptured a critical hydraulic line and set off  a 3,000-degree fire, destroying the giant aircraft.  </P> <P> Later that same year, a Navy F-14A fighter jet crashed upside down near El  Cajon after its crew had bailed out, seriously injuring three people on the  ground. The two crewmen abandoned the plane after telling controllers that  trouble with the jet's hydraulic system had caused them to lose control of wing  flaps.  </P></p>

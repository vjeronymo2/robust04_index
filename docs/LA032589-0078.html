			<p><P> March 25, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GROSSMONT BASEBALL PREVIEW;  </P> <P> SOME COACHES AREN'T HAPPY WITH SPLIT  </P> <P> The Grossmont Conference may have a new format after splitting into 2-A and 3-A  divisions, but the same baseball teams are favored to be the best this season.  </P> <P> Helix last year became the first team to go undefeated in the conference, which  is traditionally strong in baseball. The Highlanders finished 16-0 in the final  season the conference had all nine teams competing at 3-A, then won its first  section 3-A title with a 1-0 victory over league rival Santana in the  championship game.  </P> <P> Helix Coach Jerry Schniepp, for one, isn't happy with the new format for  baseball.  </P> <P> "I don't like it at all," Schniepp said. "There are eight games to decide the  league champion; I think that's ridiculous in baseball.  </P> <P> "Before you had to have two pitchers to win -- now you can win with one. And I  think it takes away from the natural rivalry."  </P> <P> One thing for certain -- Helix might not necessarily be the team to beat if the  conference kept all nine schools under one division, but it is considered the  favorite in the five-team 3-A league.  </P> <P> Santana Coach Jim Saska, whose team could be challenged by Grossmont in the 2-A  division, agrees with Schniepp about the split.  </P> <P> "If you get yourself a top pitcher and a couple top hitters, you're going to  contend at any level, 2-A or 3-A," Saska said.  </P> <P> 3-A TEAMS  </P> <P> EL CAPITAN  </P> <P> Last season's record: 10-15, 5-11 league (sixth, tie).  </P> <P> Coach: Steve Vickery.  </P> <P> Top returners: Zak Salmon (senior, IF); Robert Guerrero (senior, C); Jeremy  McGarity (senior, P/1B).  </P> <P> Top newcomer: Mike Farrell (junior, P/2B); Jim Marchesi (junior, P).  </P> <P> Outlook: The Vaqueros (6-4) finished second in the Sun Devil tournament in Las  Vegas this week. Their only loss was to Las Vegas Valley, which is the No. 22  team in the nation according to USA Today, averaging 16.8 runs. Marchesi (0-3,  2.13 ERA) allowed just one earned run in the 4-0 loss.  </P> <P> "Our strength has been and is going to be our pitching this year," Vickery  said.  </P> <P> McGarity, 3-0 pitching and .350 batting, is off to a good start. Junior  left-hander David Rios is 2-1. Jason Phipps, last year's top pitcher, is 1-0  after pitching a one-hitter with 12 strikeouts. Salmon was fourth in the  conference last year with a .429 average, a school record 39 hits and 11  doubles.  </P> <P> GRANITE HILLS  </P> <P> Last season's record: 15-10, 9-7 league (fourth).  </P> <P> Coach: Gordy Thompson.  </P> <P> Top returners: John Fenn (senior, 2B); Jeff Waymire (senior, SS); Brian Giles  (senior, CF); Pete Stacey (senior, C).  </P> <P> Top newcomer: Ryan O'Coyne (junior, P).  </P> <P> Outlook: The Eagles might have the strongest hitting in the league, with  several experienced players returning. Fenn, an all-section 3-A second baseman,  hit .416 last season, and Waymire returns at shortstop after hitting .361 with  19 RBIs and five home runs. Giles, an all-section running back in football, hit  .321 last season and .323 as a sophomore and returns to the outfield. Pitching  will be key. The top returner is Brandt Glasener, 2-1 with a 2.94 ERA last  year. O'Coyne was 6-3 on the junior varsity.  </P> <P> HELIX  </P> <P> Last season's record: 23-2, 16-0 league (first).  </P> <P> Coach: Jerry Schniepp.  </P> <P> Top returners: Rich Haar (senior, SS); Jason Ledford (senior, 1B); Tory Winrow  (senior, 3B); Damon Chase (senior, 2B).  </P> <P> Top newcomer: Rob Ippolito (junior, P).  </P> <P> Outlook: The infield is made up of three-year starters, but the Highlanders  will miss all-section pitcher Rick Navarro (now at San Diego State) and catcher  Ricky Page (U.S. International). Navarro led the section with a 14-0 record and  a 1.30 ERA; Page led the conference in hitting at .470 last season.  </P> <P> Haar averaged .400 last season and Chase .366. The question for the Highlanders  is pitching; they also lost Damon Luban, who was 10-1 last season. Rob Ippolito  has won his first two starts.  </P> <P> MONTE VISTA  </P> <P> Last season's record: 12-15, 5-11 league (sixth, tie).  </P> <P> Coach: Rob Phillips.  </P> <P> Top returners: Vern Mullis (junior, OF/P); Bryan Paul (senior, C).  </P> <P> Top newcomer: None.  </P> <P> Outlook: The Monarchs were 5-21 two years ago, and last season Phillips guided  them to a 12-16 record in his first year. Things are looking up. Monte Vista is  playing on a new field and started the season 6-2-2. Monte Vista returns its  infield but will have to find some offense; the Monarchs were one of the  lightest hitting teams in the conference last year. Vern Mullis was a one-man  show as a sophomore, hitting .342 and compiling a 6-4 record with a 4.35 ERA.  </P> <P> MT. MIGUEL  </P> <P> Last season's record: 8-17, 7-9 league (fifth).  </P> <P> Coach: Mike Trigs.  </P> <P> Top returners: Doug Kemp (senior, C); Dave Simms (senior, P).  </P> <P> Top newcomer: Gene Ethridge (senior, OF).  </P> <P> Outlook: The Matadors finished a respectable fifth among nine teams last season  after a rocky start. Mt. Miguel again got off slowly this season, committing 27  errors leading to 38 unearned runs in losing six of its first seven. Ethridge,  who was ineligible last season, was an all-conference running back who is  headed to Weber State on a football scholarship. Trigs will be relying on  several football players. Keith Baldwin, a speedy wide receiver, will be in the  outfield, and lineman Doug Kemp will catch. Kemp hit .292 last season, and  Simms was 2-1 with a save and a 3.67 ERA.  </P> <P> 2-A TEAMS  </P> <P> EL CAJON VALLEY  </P> <P> Last season's record: 7-19, 3-13 league (ninth).  </P> <P> Coach: Doug Hartung.  </P> <P> Top returners: Chris Holder (senior, 2B); Jack Kaewpalug (senior, P); Kevin  Davis (senior, 3B).  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Jason Firsich (junior, P); Fred Ernst (senior CF).  </P> <P> Outlook: The Braves had a solid pitching staff last year but no offense to back  it up. But they have gained in experience, losing just one senior, and could  climb out of the league cellar. A senior infield could be the key. Hartung  hopes Kaewpalug will be joined by Firsich in the rotation by midseason. The  transfer from Northern California injured his pitching elbow in a tournament  game and is out for three weeks.  </P> <P> GROSSMONT  </P> <P> Last season's record: 17-9, 12-4 league (second).  </P> <P> Coach: Jeff Meredith.  </P> <P> Top returners: Mark Gapski (senior, P); Todd Cadi (sophomore, C).  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Jim Early (junior, DH); John Tatum (junior, 3B).  </P> <P> Outlook: Meredith said he has made so many changes as Grossmont's new coach  that the only thing staying the same is the uniforms. He inherited a team with  great talent, especially in Gapski, who began the season 3-0, and Cadi, who  made the all-league team as a freshman. The Foothillers have hit 12 home runs  in five games. Grossmont is still shaky on defense but should again contend for  the title.  </P> <P> SANTANA  </P> <P> Last season's record: 23-8, 11-5 league (third).  </P> <P> Coach: Jim Saska.  </P> <P> Top returners: Darren Forester (senior, 3B); Kyle Sebach (senior, SS); Paul  Newark (senior P/1B).  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Tom Weimbrecht (junior, 2B); Matt Hill (senior, P).  </P> <P> Outlook: The talent returns, but Saska says the fundamentals are still a little  rusty. He is impressed with Newark's pitching and hitting but is waiting for  Sebach to break out of a slump. Santana's other two solid starting pitchers are  newcomers Hill and Ferdie Hollis. Both are 2-0.  </P> <P> VALHALLA  </P> <P> Last season's record: 8-19, 4-12 (eighth).  </P> <P> Coach: Terry Love.  </P> <P> Top returners: Mark Iveson (senior, P), Dave Angotti (senior, C), John Scurlock  (senior, P).  </P> <P> Top newcomer: Tony Clark (junior, P).  </P> <P> Outlook: Love, the new coach, says Valhalla's biggest problem last year was  attitude. His philosophy of playing more as a team has already proven  successful with a 6-5-1 start. Clark, who hasn't played baseball for two years,  returns as one of Valhalla's top pitchers. An outstanding switch-hitter, he  will help Valhalla at the plate as well.  </P></p>

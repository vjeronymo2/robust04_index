			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by ITAR-TASS observer Tamara Zamyatina, especially </F> for ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI: "Speaker Ivan Rybkin's 100 Days in  Office"]    [Text] "We are already through the first quarter," Ivan  Rybkin, chairman of the lower chamber of the Federal Assembly,  said recently about the State Duma, and consequently about  himself. This measure of time, to which we are accustomed, can  be replaced by the 100-day period which has been adopted in the  West, whereupon preliminary assessments of a political leader's  activity are made.    The ascent of the former leader of the "Communists of  Russia"  faction in the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet and currently  member of the Russian Federation Agrarian Party, to the post of  State Duma chairman, was at first perceived very cautiously and  coolly by politicians and the press. However, since his first  few weeks of leading the lower chamber of the parliament, Ivan  Rybkin has "grown" perceptibly in the eyes of the  deputies-democrats and observers, thanks primarily to the  striking contrast with Ruslan Khasbulatov. Unlike him, the new  speaker does not pull up people who are speaking, he does not  get involved in arguments with them, and -- and this is very  important for a speaker -- does not put the stress on the wrong  syllables. According to an ironic observation by NTV Chief  Editor Igor Malashenko following an interview with Ivan Rybkin  on the ITOGI program, "this is the first politician in our  country who knows the word `definition.'"    You can assume how difficult it is for a "communist  speaker,"  as Ivan Rybkin is described by the world news agencies, to  balance between the right wing and the left wing in the Duma.  In this regard, the most dramatic event for him in the 100 days  of his chairmanship has been the vote in the Duma on the package  of decisions on the amnesty. On the one hand, the  Zhirinovskiyites, the Communists, and the Agrarians would not  have forgiven the head of the Duma for defecting while, on the  other hand, the presidential and democratic wing was following  his stance vigilantly, as if with X-ray eyes. In this tense  clash, Ivan Rybkin saved face thanks to the readiness  demonstrated by the Russian Federation president's aide Georgiy  Satarov to submit to the State Duma sitting the question of  amending the decree on a political amnesty, which, however, was  not fated to come about. On the other hand, the chairman of the  State Duma did not generate irritation among his own supporters  either, since he is upholding the material and housing interests  of former Russian Federation people's deputies before the  Presidential Administration, including the instigators of the  3-4 October events in Moscow. "Magnanimity disheartens  opponents, and it is impossible to approach civil peace without  the idea of forgetting the past," -- that is how Ivan Rybkin  answered my question about whether he considers the transfer of  Moscow apartments to the ownership of Ilya Konstantinov and  Sergey Baburin, for example, to be moral.    However, in his plan to transform his views from communist  ones to social-democratic ones, Ivan Rybkin is generating sharp  condemnation in the opposition camp. At the March rally in  Moscow, devoted to the anniversary of the referendum on  preserving the USSR, the speakers publicly renounced their  former kindred spirit, which undoubtedly worked to the benefit  of the centrist image of the chairman of the lower chamber of  the parliament. "I am not the speaker of two factions, but of  the entire Duma," Ivan Rybkin said about this.    Members of the "Russia's Choice" faction, who at first did  not trust the speaker -- who was not "one of their men" by  definition -- now clearly sympathize with him. Furthermore,  judging by the results of the visit by a State Duma delegation  headed by Ivan Rybkin to Finland, I would boldly call his views  on economics entirely liberal. At a meeting with the leadership  of the Central Union of Industry and Employers in Helsinki, the  Duma speaker sharply rebuked the "state parasites, running to  Chernomyrdin for money," and promised to use his powers for the  adoption of laws on granting only targeted credits, accompanied  by clear control of their use.    Giving his own assessment of his 100 days of endeavors in  the  post of speaker, Ivan Rybkin noted with satisfaction in our  conversation that the "chamber has not decided to implement the  principle of formal majority [formalnoye bolshinstvo] in  adopting decisions," and he added that in Russia's history it  has actually been the minority which has often turned out to be  right.    Ivan Rybkin considers the adoption of the federal budget for  the second quarter and the joint work with the government on the  draft budget for 1994 and 1995 to be on the positive side of the  State Duma's activity. In addition, he also singled out serious  work done by the chamber, such as the Civil, Land, Electoral,  and Administrative Codes, prepared for examination at the State  Duma's sitting.    For journalists, the most important indicator of a  politician's opinions remains his attitude to the press, for  which Ruslan Khasbulatov was particularly "famous." Again,  unlike him, when asked whether it is not time for the government  and the parliament to give up the state press organs, Ivan  Rybkin answered that, apart from a few individual deputies, the  State Duma does not lay claim to its own press organ, and is  prepared to be satisfied with a supplement in ROSSIYSKAYA  GAZETA, where adopted laws will be officially published. At the  same time, the chamber speaker believes, the State Duma should  not "support" the entire newspaper, but should only pay for  expenditure involved in publishing the supplement. He also  deems it necessary to provide a certain number of hours of  broadcasting on state television for the federal organs of  power, citing the experience of the BBC state television company  in Britain. On the other hand, Ivan Rybkin warned journalists  against "going to the other extreme, when individual economic  groups make the mass media subordinate to themselves."    A fine morning augurs a nice day. May the "weather" in the  State Duma speaker's mutual relations with the president, the  deputies' factions, and the press remain fine -- previous  political storms which raged on the political pinnacle, cost  society too dear.</p>

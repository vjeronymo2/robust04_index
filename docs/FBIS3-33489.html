The trial against Isaac Chavarria, accused of drug  trafficking as a result of testimony by drug trafficker Meco  Dominguez, is turning into a process against the MIR. The  Dominguez file is a bomb that is beginning to take effect.    According to Meco Dominguez' testimony, Isaac Chavarria was  a  powerful drug trafficker protected by the MIR. The drugs and  documents found at Chavarria's house and farms, as well as the  testimony of half a dozen arrested drug traffickers are  confirming the charges made by Dominguez.    Chavarria was an official MIR member. He obtained a MIR  membership card in 1992 signed by Santa Cruz Prefect Rolando  Arostegui and the MIR chief of Santa Cruz Department.    A Chavarria employee who is now under arrest, (Wilbert Cox  Molina), described how Chavarria purchased and sold drugs.  (Wilbert) states: "I also want to mention here that while my  employer, Isaac Chavarria, whom I guarded, was hospitalized in  the Calacoto Clinic in La Paz, he was visited on several  occasions by Colonel Jorge Velazquez, chief of the Government  House aides de camp; Mrs. Edith Paz Zamora; and Rosario Paz  Zamora, who took him flowers; as well as by [MIR president]  Oscar Eid Franco, who paid the hospital bill. He gave Edgar  Fernandez [another Chavarria employee] about $25,000 to pay the  hospital expenses." Oscar Eid Franco has confirmed that he paid  the bill.    In this file we also find the answers to several questions.  Meco Dominguez was arrested and taken to court when he broke his  partnership with Chavarria and therefore with the MIR. Dominguez  operated in the Regine discotheque, which has been closed by  police investigations. Discotheque owner Juan Carlos Peredo Paz  was arrested recently. Peredo Paz is a MIR member and a former  official from the Agricultural Bank and the National Bank  Superintendency. He has been a middleman in operations to  launder dollars from drug trafficking activities. Peredo Paz has  acknowledged that twice he received checks from Meco Dominguez  for a total of $1.3 million.    In the third section of Meco Dominguez' case file we find a  letter found by the Special Anti-Narcotics Force [FELCN] in  Chavarria's house. It is signed by Edgar Fernandez Lazcano, who  is currently at large. In this letter, Edgar Fernandez tells  Chavarria, for whom he worked, that in November 1990 he was  arrested by the FELCN in La Paz but was soon released from  prison thanks to a telephone call that he, Edgar Fernandez,  thinks was made by Susana Seleme [not further identified] from  Government House.    Two pieces of evidence that unfortunately involve former  President Jaime Paz Zamora are missing from this file. One of  them is a video found in the house of Chavarria that FELCN did  not want to show to either the public or the court. The FELCN  also did not send to court the conflicting testimony between  Meco Dominguez and Chavarria. In the testimony, Dominguez said  in front of Chavarria that when Jaime Paz Zamora was president  of the Republic he had lunch with Chavarria in a Santa Cruz  restaurant. Meco Dominguez was present at the lunch but he says  he did not hear the conversation between the two.    Two photographs, which already have been published in the  newspapers, are also missing from the file. The first, which was  first published four years ago, shows Jaime Paz Zamora and  Chavarria together. The second picture was published on 20  February by EL DIARIO and shows Paz Zamora, Meco Dominguez, and  top MIR leaders together.    The only explanation the MIR has given to the public so far  is that, in effect, there was a friendship between Paz Zamora  and Chavarria. The charges made by Meco Dominguez now must be  proven or rejected in court. Has this friendship led Paz Zamora  to cover up the illegal activities of Isaac Chavarria?</p>

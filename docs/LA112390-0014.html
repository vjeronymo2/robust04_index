			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE HOME COOK: IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT CRAB CAKE  </P> <P> If you love crab cakes, American history and miles of green-grass horse  country, head for Baltimore. I did the other week. My mission: to check out the  variety of crab cakes and come home with a recipe for the best.  </P> <P> One of the interesting variations I tried had a base of mashed potatoes instead  of mayonnaise (it was too thick and clumsy for the delicate crab; mayonnaise  seems just right). Others were doctored up with dry Sherry, mustard, bits of  sweet red and green pepper, chives or Worcestershire sauce. Most crab cakes had  hot pepper sauce or a hint of hot, spicy pepper. The flavor of crab should not  be suppressed with other assertive, mundane ingredients.  </P> <P> One of the most famous crab restaurants in Baltimore is Obrychi's, which has  been serving crab, clam and shrimp to a steady stream of customers since 1949.  We arrived at Obrychi's at lunch time, and the dining room was already filled  with diners unabashedly eating food with their fingers and wiping their chins  constantly. The room was cheery, noisy and communal.  </P> <P> We first ordered crab cakes. They came moist, sweet and golden, with French  fries, coleslaw and catsup on the side. It was hard to fault the cakes, but the  flavor was slightly flat. A few drops of lemon juice helped, but this was not  the recipe that I came for.  </P> <P> Our next order was for Obrychi's famous steamed hard-shell crabs. Before they  arrived, the waitress covered our table with brown wrapping paper and brought  us each a little wooden mallet and a paring knife, plus a stack of paper  napkins. In a few minutes she arrived with a dozen smallish crabs and dumped  them on our table. They were dark red, streaked with brown from the Old Bay  spice mixture in which they are steamed. The crabs are layered in pots with a  shallow amount of water and vinegar, sprinkled with salt and spices. The pot is  tightly covered and the crabs are steamed about 20 minutes. They were the best  ever.  </P> <P> But I was looking for crab cakes, and I finally found the ones I was looking  for at the Lexington Market. This is the oldest market in America, a gigantic  two-story building that has myriad food stalls, ready-to-eat everything, and  stands with fresh produce, poultry, pork and fish. We went to Lexington's on  Saturday around noon, and it was teeming with the regulars who shop, eat, meet  friends and have their weekly spree.  </P> <P> Faidley's is a food stall with one continuous line of waiting customers. No  wonder people wait: The crab cakes here were incredible -- moist, creamy, full  of the taste of crab.  </P> <P> A large sign on the wall said that Faidley's makes the crab cakes with backfin  crab, mayonnaise, Dijon mustard and saltine crackers. I have tested and  rearranged amounts of these four ingredients, and the following recipe is an  example of the Faidley crab cake. Serve these cakes with coleslaw, bread and  butter and ice-cold beer. Grapefruit Ice and a cookie will neatly finish the  meal.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BALTIMORE CRAB CAKES  </P> <P> 1 cup mayonnaise  </P> <P> 4 teaspoons Dijon mustard  </P> <P> 2 cups saltine cracker crumbs  </P> <P> 2 cups cooked crab meat  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons oil  </P> <P> Lemon wedges  </P> <P> Hot pepper sauce  </P> <P> Combine mayonnaise and Dijon mustard in mixing bowl. Stir until well blended.  Add 1 cup cracker crumbs and crab meat and mix well.  </P> <P> Spread remaining 1 cup cracker crumbs on large piece wax paper. Divide crab  mixture into 8 equal portions and pat each into ball. Gently flatten each ball  into 3-inch round, about 3/4-inch thick. Lightly dredge each round cake with  cracker crumbs.  </P> <P> Heat oil in large skillet over medium heat. Fry cakes over medium heat until  golden on each side. Serve hot with lemon wedges and hot pepper sauce. Makes  about 4 servings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> GRAPEFRUIT ICE  </P> <P> 3/4 to 1 cup sugar (depending on tartness of grapefruit juice)  </P> <P> 1/2 cup water  </P> <P> 3 cups freshly squeezed grapefruit juice  </P> <P> Combine sugar and water in saucepan and boil until sugar is dissolved, about 1  minute. Cool. Stir in grapefruit juice. Pour into ice cube trays or bowl. Cover  and freeze. Serve in little glasses or bowls. (If ice is frozen in bowl, let  stand few minutes to soften slightly for easier scooping.) Makes about 4  servings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cracking Crab  </P> <P> The method of cracking and extracting crab meat from the shell is simple. Place  the blade of a paring knife across the middle of a crab leg and give the top of  the blade a crack with a mallet. The blade cuts through, and then you can  easily pry the meat out with the tip of the paring knife.  </P></p>

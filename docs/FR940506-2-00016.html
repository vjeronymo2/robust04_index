			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The orchard set-up costs for all growers were amortized over 20 years (See memorandum to Holly A. Kuga, 4/21/94). Because several growers failed to provide actual orchard set-up costs, we must base our determination on the ``best information available'' (BIA), pursuant to 19 CFR 353.37(a). For those growers that did not or could not provide actual set-up costs, we used grower number 17's average cost per hectare, collected at verification, as BIA to calculate set-up costs. These are the highest orchard set-up costs of the 20 growers in our sample.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For growers that allocated costs over the productive area, that is, canopy area, we made adjustments to include the headlands and sidelands in the productive area of the kiwifruit orchard for the purpose of allocating costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We made adjustments to growers' cost for depreciation, interest, labor, repairs, management, vehicles, fertilizer, spraying, rates (property tax), electricity, shelter, water, general and administrative, pruning, and mowing on a farm-specific basis where appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the grower that failed verification, we used BIA to determine its COP, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.37(a). This BIA was based on the highest COP we calculated for all responding growers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We calculated a simple average COP from the sampled growers' individual COPs. The total COP was calculated on a New Zealand dollar per single-layer tray equivalent basis (NZ$/SLT).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to Department practice, in conducting our COP analysis, if over 90 percent of a respondent's sales of a particular model were at prices above the COP, we did not disregard any below-cost sales of that model because we determined that the respondent's below-cost sales were not made in substantial quantities, as required under section 773(b) of the Tariff Act. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Certain Carbon Steel Butt-Weld Pipe Fittings from Thailand; Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  57 FR 21065 (1992). If between 10 and 90 percent of a respondent's sales of a particular model were at prices above the COP, we retained the sales above cost for analysis, and we examined the sales below cost to determine whether they occurred over an extended period of time. Consistent with the Departments' practice, the Department disregarded those sales made below cost if occurring in more than two months. Where we found that more than 90 percent of respondent's sales of a model were at prices below the COP and over an extended period of time, we disregarded all home market sales of that model and based FMV on constructed value (CV) in accordance with section 773(b) of the Tariff Act. There is no information on the record demonstrating that prices of below cost sales would recover all costs within a reasonable period of time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To calculate CV, the statutory minimum profit of eight percent was added because the NZKMB's actual profit was less than the statutory minimum (See section 773(e) of the Tariff Act). We added selling, general and administrative expenses for the NZKMB to the farm's average cost per tray because the actual expenses were higher than the statutory minimum of 10 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We adjusted third-country prices, where appropriate, to reflect deductions for rebates, New Zealand inland freight, New Zealand inland freight insurance, New Zealand port loading expenses, ocean freight and charter insurance. Direct advertising, imputed credit, and letter of credit charges were also deducted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We also deducted indirect selling expenses including inventory carrying costs, New Zealand instore and fire insurance, product liability and tamper insurance, indirect advertising, and other indirect selling expenses when calculating FMV for comparison to ESP transactions. This deduction for third country indirect selling expenses was capped by the amount represented by U.S. indirect selling expenses plus U.S. commissions, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Preliminary Results of Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We have preliminarily determined that the following margin exists for the period November 27, 1991, through May 31, 1993:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,6 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Manufacturer/exporter  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Margin (percent) <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> New Zealand Kiwifruit Marketing Board  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 35.86 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested parties may request disclosure within five days of the date of publication of this notice, and a hearing within 10 days of the date of publication.

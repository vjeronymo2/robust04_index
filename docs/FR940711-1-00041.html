			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A section 926.7001 is proposed to state DOE policy, as set forth in section 3021 of the Energy Policy Act, concerning the award of contracts and subcontracts to organizations meeting the three target group designations. In addition, this section would establish the primary mechanisms that DOE would use in meeting its Energy Policy Act 10 percent goal through the competitive procurement process, as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Competitive Energy Policy Act requirements set aside for small disadvantaged businesses, including women-owned businesses, under the Section 8(a) program; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Competitive awards that provide an evaluation preference to offerors from among one of the three Energy Policy Act target groups.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A section 926.7002 is proposed to establish that the requesting organization has the principal obligation to identify which procurements are subject to the Energy Policy Act. In that determination, a program office would use as its standard whether the instant requirement directly satisfies an Energy Policy Act program or requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A section 926.7003 is proposed to direct the use of DOE Small Business/Labor Surplus Area Set-Aside and 8(a) Program Review Procedures as a mechanism to ensure that full consideration be given to identifying entities from among the Energy Policy Act target groups.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A section 926.7004 is proposed to recognize the statutory change (as set forth in section 3021(b) of the Energy Policy Act) to the size standard for engineering services under Energy Policy Act procurements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A section 926.7005 is proposed to create an evaluation preference to be used in competitive procurements for Energy Policy Act requirements, where such procurements have not been conducted under Section 8(a) competitive procedures. The evaluation preference would take the form of an evaluation criterion providing that award shall be made to an entity from among the Energy Policy Act target groups where such entity is among those under consideration for final selection and is ranked as essentially equal to the best other proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, at section 926.7005 it is proposed to provide consideration of the proposer's subcontracting opportunities to entities from among the Energy Policy Act target groups as part of the business management proposal evaluation and, in Energy Policy Act requirements valued at more than $500,000, as part of the evaluation of the Small Business and Small Business Subcontracting Plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A section 926.7006 is proposed to provide guidance on reporting requirements needed to measure DOE performance in meeting the 10 percent Energy Policy Act goal. In addition, this section identifies the types of contract awards that will be counted toward the DOE goal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Instructions pertaining to the use of solicitation provisions and contract clauses relating to DOE section 3021 implementation are proposed to be contained in section 926.7007. The text of the solicitation provisions and contract clauses relating to DOE implementation of section 3021 are provided in Subpart 952.2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A solicitation provision is proposed at 952.226&hyph;70, entitled Subcontracting goals under section 3021(a) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;486), to set out the subcontracting evaluation preference. Most importantly, the provision requires offerors, that are not one of the three section 3021 target groups, to propose individual subcontracting goals for each of the three target groups. In addition, the provision explains how the evaluation preference will be applied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A contract clause at 952.226&hyph;72 is proposed to be added to facilitate implementation of the subcontracting program goals and reporting requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A clause is proposed to be added at section 952.226&hyph;73, entitled Energy Policy Act Target Group Certification, establishing the certification to be used by entities from among the Energy Policy Act target groups to clearly establish their qualification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Use of the clause at FAR 52.219&hyph;14 in all awards to entities from among the Energy Policy Act target groups would place a contractual limitation on the amount of subcontracting that can be used by a minority college or university or a woman-owned business in performance of a contract for an Energy Policy Act requirement. The limitation, which restricts subcontracted effort to less than 50 percent of the cost incurred for personnel, mirrors a similar provision now applied to small disadvantaged business under the Federal acquisition system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

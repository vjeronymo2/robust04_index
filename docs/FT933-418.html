			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: US public backs nuclear energy option Sir, David Lascelles's article, 'Cold comfort in future' (September 14) clearly fits the old paradigm of looking at nuclear power, which holds that, if it weren't for the public's lack of support, nuclear energy would be considered a viable energy resource for the future. As the person responsible for public opinion research for the US nuclear power industry, I believe that the large body of research supports a 'new paradigm', which better fits the public's attitudes towards nuclear energy. This new view allows for more choices: people might think of nuclear energy as dangerous, but they also believe that nuclear plants are safe. They might prefer solar energy, but they want nuclear energy to be one of their options. People view energy sources as complementary, not as competitors. More than two-thirds of Americans think the US should be developing both nuclear energy and solar for future energy needs, and three-quarters believe in keeping the option open to build new nuclear energy plants. Public concern for clean air and new public awareness of nuclear energy's clean air benefits are increasing the appeal of this energy source as part of the mix. When the need for new electricity-generating plants becomes clear, nuclear energy may not be the first choice of all communities. But the public opinion climate that exists today would allow nuclear energy to be at the table for consideration on its own merits.

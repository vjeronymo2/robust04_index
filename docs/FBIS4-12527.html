			<p>BFN     [Text] India has cautioned the United States against  triggering of an arms race in the subcontinent by supplying  sophisticated aircraft to Pakistan. The Indian side told the  U.S. deputy secretary of State, Mr. Strobe Talbott, that any  supply of F-16 aircraft to Islamabad will compel New Delhi to  take measures in response. This will diversify the much-needed  resources for the welfare of the people and affect the ongoing  economic reforms. It was emphatically stated at the talks that  the U.S. move is of great concern to New Delhi. The Indian side  said in the public mind there is a U.S. tilt toward Pakistan  seen as the replay of the cold war attitude. It said that Jammu  and Kashmir is an integral part of India and territorial  integrity will not be sacrificed at any cost. On nuclear  nonproliferation and disarmament, India backs the 1988 action  plan announced by Rajiv Gandhi which offers several initiatives  for achieving the goal. On the Washington-backed Pakistan  proposal for a multilateral fora for nonproliferation, India and  the U.S. agreed to continue the dialogue on the concept.    Mr. Talbott had an hour-long meeting with the prime minister  today. Mr. Narasimha Rao has accepted in principle President  Clinton's invitation to visit the United States. The dates of  the visit will be worked out later by the two sides.    Addressing a press conference, Mr. Talbott ruled out supply  of F-16 aircraft to Pakistan, if Islamabad does not agree to a  verifiable cap on its nuclear weapons program. He said nuclear  proliferation is a major issue which needs to be addressed  immediately. He said the U.S. favors expansion of the UN  Security Council and India being the largest democracy is a  clear leader to (?claim) a position in the council.    Mr. Talbott has since reached Islamabad on a three-day visit  to Pakistan.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Amman, April 17 (XINHUA) -- Minister of Culture Amin  Mahmud today met with a three-member Chinese cultural delegation  led by Fan Zhonghui, deputy director-general of the Ministry of  Culture, which had a stopover here on its way to Baghdad.    The two sides exchanged views on furthering cultural  contacts  and exchanges between the two countries.    During the meeting, Mahmud said China's political views and  brilliant culture impressed him profoundly during his school  years in Egypt. He said he highly appreciated China's stand of  supporting the Palestine cause, which was made clear by late  Premier Zhou Enlai, whom he first met in Cairo as a student in  the audience.    He expressed hope that Jordanian-Chinese cultural exchanges  will continue to develop with constant mutual visits of cultural  troupes and teams.    Fan Zhonghui said that China and Jordan have enjoyed a fine  relation in politics, economy and other fields including  culture. He proposed that the two sides organize more  small-scaled programs of cultural exchanges such as art  galleries, exhibition of arts and handicrafts and troupe  performances.    China has earlier agreed to provide Jordan with about 9  million U.S. dollars to help the kingdom build a library and a  children's hospital.</p>

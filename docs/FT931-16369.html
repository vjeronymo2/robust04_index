			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Letter: Evil destiny of Jabez Balfour Sir, I was interested in the article in your centenary issue ('Police hot on the heels of Jabez Balfour', January 4) as Balfour was my wicked great, great uncle. You refer to his talkativeness. His mother commented when he was 10 that she had 'never heard anything like him'. I am working on a biography of his mother, Mrs Clara Lucas Balfour, who overcame illegitimacy and childhood poverty to become a travelling lecturer, speaking on temperance, literature, history and the position of women. Her contribution to adult education is now almost unknown. The scandal surrounding her youngest son may be one reason. Jabez was only five years old when she commented in a letter: 'There is very much to fear as well as hope in his case. He will be either good or evil.' If anyone has information on the Balfours, I should be interested to know of it. Janet Cunliffe-Jones, 9 Elson Road, Formby, Liverpool L37 2EG</p>

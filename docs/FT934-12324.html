			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / On derivatives, conjurors and rocket scientists When derivatives come out of the rocket scientist lab into the domestic retail market journalists start to get edgy. We do not believe in magic, although we do know there are some clever conjurors around. A few weeks ago I expressed reservations about the promises attached to some of the high income retail savings products being launched in the UK to attract income-starved investors. One of them, the Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial Higher Income Plan, yielding 10 per cent, has attracted about Pounds 400m since March. Its success has triggered the arrival of a similarly structured rival from Morgan Grenfell. Briefly, this scheme works by leveraging its income through writing options. Just over half the assets are invested in UK blue chip equities, the rest in loans. On top of the resulting overall 5 per cent yield, the fund can generate 6 or 7 per cent a year by taking in premium from over-the-counter options - puts and calls - against its portfolio. It thus loses much of any capital growth, but buys other options to protect itself against general market falls. This is an ingenious arrangement, but it looks more like a trading operation than an investment portfolio. What are the risks? Even if they are well designed, derivatives trading programmes can fall foul of poor liquidity or counterparty risk. I asked Morgan Grenfell the source of the OTC options, and was told that the fund managers had signed a confidentiality agreement. So much for transparency. In fact there need be no secret. The options are being created by the equity derivatives unit of Swiss Bank Corporation in London; effectively, this bank's wholesale market services are being turned into retail products by Hypo F &amp; C, Morgan Grenfell and others. An earlier range of retail products focused on guarantees of various kinds - for instance, that the FT-SE 100 Index would be at least matched at some date in the future - but falling interest rates have made it more difficult to design attractive guaranteed products, which have relied on using income to buy derivatives contracts. At the same time, however, an opportunity to launch high income products has arisen, using derivatives to generate the kind of yield now so sorely missed by savers in deposit-taking institutions. Innovation may only just be beginning. On the wholesale market SBC lists 15 varieties of equity option contracts, including as-you-like options, exploding options and deferred strike options. But how reliable is all this? Extensive backtesting investigations are conducted into how products such as the Hypo F &amp; C fund would have performed historically. Apparently it would have sailed through the 1987 crash quite happily. But the future will always spring more surprises than the past. The doomsters are easy enough to find. The Bundesbank last week reflected gloomily on the possibility of a chain reaction leading to disaster if problems in derivatives were to lead to a collapse of liquidity in the cash markets. Earlier in the month Mr Henry Kaufman, the Wall Street analyst, warned about poor standards of regulation and unwarranted complacency about the real level of risks in derivatives. European central banks, he pointed out, have been generating vast profits for private sector participants in the derivatives markets through their clumsy mistakes in the foreign exchange markets, especially in 1992, but just suppose it had been the other way around? In practical terms, investors in innovative retail products are scarcely exposed to apocalyptic risks, merely to the possibility that the income may turn out to be less than expected, or the danger that allegedly 'unusual' conditions may cause a few points of loss of capital. The derivative markets are now vast, but are still quite immature. Their complexity invalidates the old adage that you should only put your money in (or report on) investments you understand. Moreover the proprietary nature of the product designs based upon OTC contracts means the propositions are becoming increasingly opaque, even to experts. We just hope that the rocket scientists will not reinvent the nuclear bomb by accident.</p>

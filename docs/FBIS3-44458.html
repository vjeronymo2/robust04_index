Eighteen open border posts have been set up along its  4,200-km border line. Last year, some 470,000 Chinese and  foreign business people went through these posts as well as 2.07  million tons of cargo, up by a third than in 1992.    By now, the region has established an extensive transport  network of railways, highways, water routes and airlines.    The Hulun Buir league in the north of the region, which is  famous for its flourishing border trade, has set up seven  trading posts along its 1,700-km-long border line with Mongolia  and Russia.    To date, the league has established stable trade relations  with more than 1,000 firms from 22 countries and regions, such  as the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Mongolia, the  United States, Japan and the Republic of Korea.    Besides, the league has opened 12 tourist routes leading to  the vicinity. In 1993, the volume of barter trade between  Chinese, Russian and Mongolian tourists stood at 20 million yuan  (3.4 million U.S. dollars) and one billion rubles (8 million  U.S. dollars), respectively.    Manzhouli has always been called the "bridge of Eurasia" for  its large trade handling volume. Since the city was approved by  the government to be an open outlet in 1992, it has become  China's largest border trade city, which has multiple functions,  including exporting, processing, financial trade, international  transport and storage.    Erenhot, another renowned border city, also launched  large-scale construction projects last year. As more new roads,  trade centers and storehouses are being built, the city is  developing into a new grassland border trade center.    To make it possible to do business all the year round, a  bridge is expected to be built across the Erhkuna river along  the Sino- Russian border.    Meanwhile, air traffic is expanding. In addition to the  weekly flight between Hohhot and Ulaanbaatar, capital of  Mongolia, a through-flight between Hohhot and Hong Kong is to  open to traffic before long. The region's second airport,  Hailar airport, is to operate soon.</p>

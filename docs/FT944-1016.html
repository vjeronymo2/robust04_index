			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Emap in joint venture with DoE agency Emap, the media and exhibitions group, said yesterday it was forming a joint venture information business with the Building Research Establishment, an agency of the Department of the Environment. In what is believed to be a first, BRE and Emap Business Communications will set up a new company, Construction Research Communications, with the media group holding 70 per cent of the shares and the rest held by the office of the secretary of state for the environment. BRE's publishing activities range from a monthly subscription digest to environmental assessment titles and the BRE Housing Design Handbook. Many of the BRE publications are essential reading for both engineers and architects. The new company fits in with Emap's policy of adding specialised professional information services to its business publications.</p>

			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / ANC criticises de Klerk over massacre THE African National Congress yesterday stepped up its criticism of the government after the massacre of nearly 40 people in Boipatong in the Vaal triangle, but stopped short of saying it would pull out of negotiations. The ANC made clear, however, that with discussion at the Codesa constitutional forum deadlocked, the focus of its energies in coming weeks would be devoted to taking the political struggle to the streets. At a briefing for journalists and diplomats, Mr Ronnie Kasrils, ANC campaigns co-ordinator, said it was hoping to have millions of people on the streets by August, raising the possibility of a 'Leipzig option'. This included a general strike, probably in mid-August. In the course of a scathing attack on the government, Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary-general, said earlier that more black people had died during the three years of President F W de Klerk's administration than in the previous 40 years of National party rule. Mr Ramaphosa said Mr de Klerk had facilitated such slaughter by legalising the carrying of dangerous weapons in 1990. Another senior ANC official, Mr Joe Slovo, said the Boipatong massacre had no link with the Soweto Day stayaway on June 16. Referring to government warnings before June 16 that mass action would lead to violence, Mr Slovo added: 'Every statement by the representatives of the government, both before and after June 16, was an act of intimidation and an act of incitement to violence. And it has come to pass that the prophecy has been fulfilled by the prophets themselves.'</p>

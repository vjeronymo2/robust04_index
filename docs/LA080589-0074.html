			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY SPORTS;  </P> <P> PARENTS AND CHILDREN DISCOVER ORGANIZED PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES PROMOTE  TOGETHERNESS  </P> <P> Steve Flowers of Chino Hills had known 17-year-old Tony Ramirez since Tony was  a toddler. They had never been very fond of each other, Flowers recalls, and  their relationship wasn't enhanced when he married Tony's mother.  </P> <P> Tony admits he was cutting classes and had an attitude as long as the 91  Freeway. And Flowers remembers that in his new role as stepfather he was  getting rubbed the wrong way too often.  </P> <P> One day last year, though, Flowers took Tony bowling. To the delight of both,  Tony discovered an unusual penchant for knocking over pins. They began to bowl  together regularly, becoming so accomplished a duo, in fact, that they entered  the 1988 Avco Family Bowling Tournament, winning the finals for Southern  California.  </P> <P> The tournament, held annually for the last 14 years, pairs children with a  parent or grandparent in an attempt by Avco Financial Services and, before  them, by the Bowling Proprietor's Assn. of America, to foster family  togetherness.  </P> <P> Regional winners receive a $500 college scholarship and a free trip to  Washington to compete in the nationals. National winners can win scholarships  up to $5,000 per age division.  </P> <P> In October, however, Flowers' right leg, hip and right arm were severely  disabled by rheumatism. Undaunted, the pain-ridden Flowers hobbled onto the  lanes and began to train himself to bowl left-handed. Anything to keep Tony  interested.  </P> <P> This year, Flowers and Ramirez placed second in the state finals. Moreover, it  was Tony who carried the two of them.  </P> <P> The family that plays together, as growing numbers of Americans have  discovered, stays together. At a time when the traditional nuclear family --  those with the mother at home, the father at work, the children at school and  no domestic help or live-in relatives to count on -- has become an endangered  species, this realization appears to have sparked a modest renaissance  throughout the country in organized family recreation.  </P> <P> Many American families, of course, continue to seek recreation on their own.  Camping, fishing and other outdoor pursuits remain staples of the American  recreative scene. And in some areas, city parks and recreation departments  offer organized family-type activities.  </P> <P> For example, Jackie Tatum, assistant general manager for the Valley region,  points out a plethora of recreative alternatives for families, which include  softball, baseball and soccer teams in which parents participate as coaches and  team mothers; equestrian centers such as the one at Griffith Park, and numerous  Mommy &amp; Me programs for women with children between 18 months and 2 1/2  years.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Organized Activities  </P> <P> In Los Angeles and nationally, however, there has been a pronounced paucity of  organized leisure activities structured for the entire family. Jim Hadaway,  general manager of recreation and parks for the city of Los Angeles, notes that  his department has preferred to invest in such family-supportive activities as  preschools, day care and latchkey programs rather than, say, softball leagues  in which every member of the family, whatever their skill level, can play.  </P> <P> Yet after decades of segregating leisure activities by age, sex and skill  level, a few recreation providers in both the private and public sectors are  packaging such pursuits as bowling, tennis and Volkssporting -- a German  variety of non-competitive pastimes that translate as "People Sports" -- to  involve every member of the family.  </P> <P> They are doing so in the growing conviction that family play opens the lines of  communication within this much-beleaguered institution, and salves the rifts  and fissures all families -- no matter how they are structured -- accrue as a  matter of course in today's world.  </P> <P> Gene Lamke is chairman of the department of recreation at San Diego State  University and director of the Institute for Leisure Behavior in San Diego. He  believes that the proliferation of specialized leisure pursuits in America that  occurred after World War II -- freeing mom to play tennis while dad golfed,  junior pitched for a Little League team and sis pirouetted at dance class --  was nothing less than a social disaster.  </P> <P> "During the mid- to late-'70s in particular," Lamke noted, "it became important  for each individual to become self-actualized. Everyone found a little niche  and explored it. Everyone became a member of the 'me' generation.  </P> <P> "Unfortunately, kids were consequently deprived of good role models. Without  any lasting interaction with their folks, they lacked direction, guidance and  the skills they needed to take care of themselves. The result was a lot of  teen-age problems."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unhealthy Situation  </P> <P> If this situation proved unhealthy for the traditional family structure, it  wreaked havoc upon those in which contact between family members had already  been minimized or undermined by divorce or the demands of the workplace.  </P> <P> Nowhere has this been more evident than in Canada, where one-third of all  marriages end in divorce; where families, which average 3.2 persons, are  smaller than anywhere in the world, and where only 20% of them fit the  traditional mold.  </P> <P> </P> <P> National Program  </P> <P> Recreation experts such as Jack Harper, a faculty member of the Physical  Education and Recreation Studies at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg,  responded by developing a national program aimed at generating awareness as to  the desirability of organized recreational activities for the entire family.  </P> <P> Although the effects of his "Together is Better" program have yet to be  assessed objectively, Harper says he believes he can discern in his country a  departure among public recreation providers from male-oriented, skill-intensive  recreational programming toward a more generalized and inclusive family format.  </P> <P> Public recreation agencies in Canada, he says, have begun supporting such  leisure pursuits as block parties by dispatching mobile vans with tug-of-war  ropes and other game equipment. Back-yard camping has also become popular, with  public parks signing out tents and other camping equipment free of charge for  the weekend. Swimming and skating lessons are being provided to people  regardless of age or sex.  </P> <P> Meanwhile in the United States, two nationally organized, regularly scheduled  family sporting opportunities have been developed through corporate  sponsorship: the Avco Family Bowling Tournament and the Equitable Family Tennis  Challenge.  </P> <P> Companies such as Avco, which target their loans to families, believed  supporting family sports to be a good business investment, although there is  some talk that they may turn the tournament back to the Bowling Proprietors  Assn. after this year, according to Richard Steinbaugh, executive director of  the association, who says the tournament will continue no matter who sponsors  it.  </P> <P> Whatever the motivations behind this sponsorship, though, these bowling and  tennis activities do seem to be getting families out of their sometimes  debilitating ruts.  </P> <P> Joe Tomasello, a 40-year-old textile sales rep from Sherman Oaks, gets his  14-year-old daughter, Nicole, on the weekends. During the week, Nicole lives  with her mother in Orange County.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Father-Daughter Game  </P> <P> Tomasello spends much of his own leisure time playing tennis, and Nicole  belonged to an Orange County team until last year, when she gave up the game to  follow other interests. But with high school looming in September, Nicole  decided she wanted to make the school tennis team. Getting her on the courts to  practice, however, proved no mean feat, said Tomasello, who thought that  committing her to play the Equitable in June would do the trick.  </P> <P> The Equitable, sponsored by the Equitable Life Assurance Society for the last  15 years, is touted as the world's largest amateur tennis tournament. Involving  more than 175,000 participants annually, it pits family doubles teams against  each other in mother/daughter, mother/son, father/daughter, father/son,  husband/wife and brother/sister constellations. Local play began in May and  June at about 240 tennis clubs throughout the country, and the regional winners  compete at the U.S. Open in New York during September.  </P> <P> Kristine Heinberg of Agoura Hills never needed an excuse to get out on the  courts. Though only 9 years old, she's ranked No. 1 in the girls 12s division  in Ventura County. She has not yet played tournaments within the United States  Tennis Assn., and thus qualifies to play the Equitable Challenge.  </P> <P> Kristine has been hitting regularly with her father, 39-year-old Craig  Heinberg, a tennis instructor, since she was 6, while her 6-year-old brother,  Ryan, trains with his mother, Diane. Tennis, Craig says, is very much a family  affair.  </P> <P> Some Americans would rather avoid stressful competition. For those, there are  less aggressive alternatives. Among them, "volksmarching," sponsored by the  American Volkssport Assn.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Volkssports Take Hold  </P> <P> Since the mid-'70s, when it was first imported from Germany by servicemen and  their families, volkssporting has become increasingly popular as a  non-competitive family pastime.  </P> <P> While volkssporting in Europe includes non-competitive walking, swimming and  cross-country skiing, Southlanders appear interested mainly in the pedestrian  pursuit volksmarching.  </P> <P> It's a cross between a sightseeing outing and a race, explains Stephen Stone,  26, a word processor in Hollywood who has helped form volksmarching clubs in  Southern California and, in 1987, established the Hollywood Star Trekkers.  </P> <P> Events are planned along routes of scenic or historic interest. Volksmarchers  are required to complete the march, which averages between 6 and 12 miles,  within a generously proscribed time period (rambles last between 3 and 6 hours,  but there are no winners or losers).  </P> <P> Participants, who include babies in strollers and the elderly, are encouraged  to take their time, talk to each other and rest frequently.  </P> <P> There are about 15 clubs in Southern California that host between them an  average of three outings a month. Stone estimates the existence of about 600  hard-core volksmarchers in the Southland and perhaps several thousand  taggers-along.  </P> <P> "I like the no-hassle feeling of just walking along," he says. "In a world  where people don't sit around the dinner table talking like they used to,  volksmarching gives you a chance to communicate and exercise concurrently. And  you get to see parts of the area you never would by car."  </P> <P> Lamke believes that as volksmarching and other family leisure pursuits continue  to attract greater numbers of Americans, as corporations continue to sponsor  family-friendly activities and as country clubs host parent-child tennis and  golf tournaments, public recreation providers in the United States will find  themselves responding with programs of their own.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Classes in the Works  </P> <P> In some municipalities, this process has already begun in earnest. Katherine  Chappelear, superintendent of recreation for the Department of Parks and  Recreation in Sunnyvale, Calif., says her office has introduced programs  emphasizing intergenerational activities -- parent/child swim classes, play  exploration classes and other activities.  </P> <P> Most municipalities, however, have not explored the possibility, for instance,  of altering the structure of softball teams so that kids and parents can  actually play together in leagues.  </P> <P> "What we've seen so far in this country is just a start," Lamke said. "We have  a long way to go, and I think it's going to take policy directives issued by  governmental agencies for us to do the concept of family play justice."  </P> <P> </P> <P> For information on the bowling tournament, contact the Bowling Proprietors  Assn. of Southern California, (818) 845-2602; for the tennis tournament,  contact the Equitable office in Stamford, Conn., (203) 353-9900; for  information on Hollywood Star Trekkers, call (213) 466-8881 or write to P.O.

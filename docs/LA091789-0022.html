			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW BOOKS: AROUND HOME  </P> <P> Artists' Jewellery, by CHARLOTTE GERE and GEOFFREY C. MUNN  </P> <P> (Antique Collectors' Club; 1989)  </P> <P> "Artists' Jewellery: Pre-Raphaelite to Arts and Crafts" offers an intriguing,  intimate look at the artists, designers and jewelers who served England's  royalty and aristocrats in the mid to late 19th Century. The text is a bit  stilted, but the story is better told through the 103 color and 141  black-and-white photographs and illustrations.  </P> <P> From pencil sketches to final pieces, the authors share the talent of Dante  Gabriel Rossetti, Sir Edwin Lutyens, Henry Wilson and William Holman-Hunt,  among others. These men, in collaboration with emiment jewelers such as Carlo  Giuliano, created one-of-a-kind keepsakes during the Pre-Raphaelite and Arts  and Crafts period. Intricate tiaras, lockets, hair ornaments and brooches  adorned with precious stones were also laden with symbols and secret messages  popular during the period. The secrets are revealed in this richly detailed  book.  </P> <P>  Available for $69.50 by special order from local bookstores, or at Rizzoli  Bookstore in Costa Mesa and at Brentano's. Also by mail from the International  Specialized Book Services, 5602 N.E. Hassalo St., Portland, Ore. 97213; or  telephone (800) 547-7734.  </P></p>

			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / A high flyer with his feet on the ground: Alitalia's chief executive, Giovanni Bisignani, talks to Haig Simonian Mr Giovanni Bisignani, chief executive of Italy's state airline, Alitalia, betrays none of the enthusiasm, let alone egomania, that infects some executives once they get their hands on an airline. Judging by the pie-charts on his computer or the neatly presented information at hand, Alitalia, with 29,000 staff and 1992 sales of L6,000bn (Pounds 2.8bn), could just as well be a steelmaker or a phone company as something exotic like an airline. Mr Bisignani became chief executive in 1989, and recently climbed even higher to become chairman of the Association of European Airlines (AEA), which links the continent's scheduled carriers. As the industry spokesman he addresses issues such as deregulation and international air traffic control. He is outwardly forthright on both subjects but, as head of a company with a virtual monopoly on major domestic routes, is more open about air traffic control than deregulation. 'The problem is not technical but political and it lies in the hands of national governments and the European Community,' he says. 'There are 54 control centres with 31 different systems, supplied by 18 computer manufacturers, with 22 different operating systems in over 70 programming languages. All this makes the European system not only complicated, but expensive to manage and extremely inefficient.' The AEA has pressed for action to sort out Europe's fragmented ATC. Mr Bisignani welcomes the commission's July go-ahead for a plan to harmonise the system. The first target - compatible computerised radar systems by 1996  -would replace antiquated methods whereby data about an aircraft in flight are passed by phone between centres. But he remains cautious: the proposal has to be approved by EC transport ministers, and governments are loath to give up sovereignty over their skies. Commercial interests mean each country would like its own version to be the model for Europe's harmonised system. 'We need to see action now,' he says. He is equally forthright on deregulation, but within the boundaries of Alitalia's rather one-sided view of 'open skies'. 'Europe's airlines must avoid the mistakes made in the US following deregulation. All they've done is to move from an oligopoly based on four names to a new oligopoly based on four other names. It's not good for the industry, it's not good for passengers'. The culprit, for Mr Bisignani, is Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code, which allows a company to continue trading while under protection from its creditors. 'The strong carriers build up cash until one of them decides to launch a fares war in the hope of driving out weaker rivals. But they can survive thanks to Chapter 11. The result is a mess. We mustn't do the same.' His concept of deregulation differs from the virtual free-for-all in the US, and, increasingly, among privatised European carriers. He makes much of the 'freedom of the skies' over Italy, claiming Lufthansa already flies to more destinations in Italy than in its home market and that Alitalia faces domestic rivals. In fact, the company has fought successfully to fend off challengers. Under a deal with the government last year, it renewed its near monopoly of major routes for a further decade, with smaller regional carriers being offered the crumbs. Such lack of direct competition perhaps explains why internal services, though improving, remain poor by other airlines' standards. Mr Bisignani is wary of big airline mergers, in spite of the British Airways-US Air tie-up and the threat to Europe's carriers by US 'mega-carriers'. Surprisingly, he draws comfort from BA's deal with US Air, although it probably spells the end of its 1990 marketing pact with Alitalia. But the accord has not altered his scepticism about alliances. Recent European enthusiasm for mergers has come from airlines which either lack a large domestic market or which have the market, but are less productive than their counterparts. 'People used to think that airlines could overcome efficiency problems simply by growing. That's no longer possible. The market is not expanding like before, and yields are falling. The only way to drive down costs in a market which has become more volatile is to be flexible. The danger is that greater size leads to less flexibility.' He has been trying to instill flexibility in Alitalia. Multi-year contracts with pilots, cabin crew and ground staff have cut strikes, although it still suffers from industrial action by outsiders. The new contracts mean pilots will fly around 520 hours a year, comparable with other European airlines with similar networks. Accusations of unreliability are met with AEA figures showing it was Europe's most punctual airline in 1990. - a fact that would surprise many domestic travellers. Earnings, though still in the red, recovered 'better than any other airline' from the shock of the Gulf war, he claims. The company, ploughing L5,000bn into a five-year investment programme, 80 per cent of it to update and expand its fleet, has become so bullish that it has introduced a frequent-flyer programme to raise 'brand loyalty'. Such confidence shapes Mr Bisignani's views on mergers. 'A national airline today needs a critical mass. That means between 25m and 30m passengers a year and a substantial home market. Alitalia should carry at least 21m people this year and still has to concentrate on improving productivity and service.' When its targets are met it might start thinking about partnerships 'on an equal basis'. With privatisation very much in the air in Italy, might Alitalia, with almost 16 per cent of its shares quoted, be poised to float more equity on the back of greater efficiency and profits? The company is hardly an investor's dream, having failed to pay a dividend since 1988. 'This year we will have a positive result,' says Mr Bisignani. But he declines to be more specific as to whether he means before or after tax - probably the best indicator it has some way to go.</p>

			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOCIETY: SOMETHING NEW ADDS A TWIST TO SOMETHING OLD  </P> <P> Radical sentiments and the Charity Ball are as uneasy in one another's company  as herring and chocolate mousse, and many of the 980 guests at "Swing Into the  '90s" may have been surprised and even scandalized by the revolutionary changes  they encountered upon entering the Hotel del Coronado Grand Ballroom.  </P> <P> Among the radical innovations at Saturday's version of San Diego's  longest-running and most traditional event were the introduction of dance cards  and boutonnieres, which may have been taken for granted at the ball's inception  in the first year of the Taft Administration (1909), but vanished as the event  evolved through wars, the Great Depression and ensuing societal changes.  </P> <P> Even more startling was chairwoman Barbara Brown's decision to replace the  playing of "The Blue Danube," the official "chairman's dance" that has always  marked the formal opening of the ball, with "Serenade in Blue."  </P> <P> Brown stoutly defended this departure from tradition.  </P> <P> "We've made a lot of changes tonight; this is a new Charity Ball for the '90s,"  she said. "I changed the chairman's dance because a lot of the young people  don't know how to waltz."  </P> <P> Brown may have challenged some of the bedrock foundations of the Charity Ball,  but she said her intention was to focus the event on its beneficiary,  Children's Hospital and Health Center.  </P> <P> "My theme this year emphasizes that this ball is for Children's Hospital, and I  think that's been lost sometimes," she said.  </P> <P> Her theme was expressed rather literally by the two bands, Columbus and the  Bill Green Orchestra, which played a lot of "swing" music and even offered rock  'n' roll and Hank Williams. The decor celebrated youth through a life-size  reproduction of the ball's logo, a swing-borne child heading for the stars, and  the entertainment featured the Music Machine from Bonita Vista High School,  which burst into the room in a flash of sapphire sequins and raw energy.  </P> <P> The spotlight focused most tightly on the hospital when Ernest Rady, chairman  of the board of trustees, took the stage to inform the audience of a major  capital campaign that will be formally introduced to the public in several  months. The hospital intends to build a new emergency room and a 114-bed wing,  and, in addition to seeking $35 million from federal and state sources, it  hopes to raise $20 million in contributions from the residents of San Diego  County.  </P> <P> Despite such innovations as dance cards (annotated to allow engagements to  waltz, fox trot or rock 'n roll), various Charity Ball constants prevailed. The  most important of these was the guest list, replete with the names of the  city's oldest families and very representative of the San Diego Establishment.  Many of these individuals occupied the ringside "boxes," or wedge-shaped  seating arrangements that replace the round tables used at most events and are  a Charity Ball institution, in many cases having been held for generations.  </P> <P> This audience makes the Charity Ball unique among San Diego fund-raisers for  more than the apparent reasons. The ball is one of the larger annual earners,  but the relationship it maintains between the community and Children's Hospital  is far more important than the funds it raises.  </P> <P> "Many people stay involved with Children's because of the Charity Ball," said  hospital President Blair Sadler. "The ball has a longstanding commitment to  Children's, and every year it reminds leading San Diegans about the hospital's  role in the community." Sadler emphasized the event's relationship to the newly  announced capital campaign by adding, "Tonight, we're alerting the leadership  of San Diego to our needs."  </P> <P> The Charity Ball program remains a classic of its kind, and many of those who  called time out from the dance floor turned eagerly through its 222 pages. A  sort of yearbook that keeps track of growing families through full-page  photographs, the program also is thick with words of encouragement from  prominent businesses. A reminder of the Navy's role in San Diego appeared on  Page 49 in the form of a photograph of the amphibious transport dock Cleveland,  whose officers and crew raised $5,000 for the ball and were represented on the  scene by Capt. Richard Cloward. Page 41 carried a message that read "Best  wishes from the shareholders of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric." However,  Southern California Edison, which has maintained a conspicuous presence at many  San Diego bashes since it instituted its bid to acquire SDG&amp;E, was  conspicuously absent from this most Establishment of events and did not  advertise in the program.  </P> <P> Mary Anne Marquis co-chaired the ball, and the committee list, as always, ran  to the greatest length of any in the year. Among its principal members were  Joanne Stevenson, Marie Collura, Pam Palisoul, Nancy Bayer, Chrissie Brannen,  Debbie Daley, Marilyn Cleator, Grace Cherashore, Carolyn Waggoner, Richel  Khoury, Christine Friel, Jo Murphy, Vangie Burt, Allison Tibbitts, Carol  Dickinson, Grace Allen and Ruth Mulvaney.  </P> <P> The guest list included the Robert Adelizzis, the Craig Starkeys, the James  Robinsons, the Douglas McColls, the Dean Blacks, the Steven Porters, the Edgar  Herveys, the Michael Alessios, the Howard Busbys, Georgia Borthwick with Tom  Fleming, Justine Fenton, the Hugh Carters, the Judson Grosvenors, the Dallas  Clarks, the George Gildreds, the William Newberns, the Robert Sedlocks, the  Daniel Larsens, the Philip Whites, the Frederick Links, the Philip Gildreds,  the Milton Chevertons, the Robert Callicotts and the Charles Bielers.  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO -- At least a few of the 2,500 attendees at the "1990 Chocolate  Festival," given Friday at the Sheraton Harbor Island as a benefit for the  Voices for Children Auxiliary, must have gained an insight into what it feels  like to be a chocolate truffle.  </P> <P> The nearly intoxicating scent of chocolate so pervaded the Champagne and Grand  ballrooms that purveyor Michel Malecot said: "After a while, the smell of all  this chocolate goes to your head. It's a kind of osmosis."  </P> <P> Even so, few took breaks while making the rounds of the dozens of booths set up  by local chocolatiers and pastry shops and by major national concerns. KyXy  Radio and Big Bear Markets co-sponsored the fund-raiser; proceeds will support  the Voices for Children program, which recruits and trains volunteers to serve  as special advocates for children who have been made wards of the court system.  </P> <P> The mounds of candies, cookies and pastries provided all the visual stimulation  that seemed necessary, but the committee aided the project by decorating the  rooms in a "Victorian Valentine" theme. "We wanted people to feel relaxed while  they overdosed on chocolate," explained co-chair Pam Sullivan.  </P> <P> General chairwoman Karen Nugent kept her distance from the booths.  </P> <P> "I've been on a really strict exercise and diet regimen, and I'm not about to  blow it," she said, though she admitted to having sampled one sweet. "That one  was to die for," she said.  </P> <P> Claudia Munak oversaw a related, higher-ticket event in a partitioned corner of  one ballroom that was provided with a pianist, champagne and tables laden with  the extravagant efforts of some of the city's best pastry cooks.  </P> <P> "Tonight is sweet because it's helping my kids," said Munak, who added that  boxes of pastries would be taken later that evening to the Food Bank and the  Hillcrest Receiving Home.  </P> <P> The committee included Betty Mabee, Karen Cohn, Jadzia Goulet, Lynn Mabee, Mag  White, Judith Harris, Julie Sarno, Virginia Napierskie, Ann Martinet, Pat  Cunningham, Charlotte Roberts and Julie Maiorano.  </P></p>

During the debate, Minister Phan Ngoc Tuong, chairman of the  Government Organization and Personnel Commission, on behalf of  the law drafting committee, further explained some issues  queried by the National Assembly deputies. The National  Assembly voted to pass some articles on which there were still  differing views and some chapters of the draft law before  passing the entire revised law on election of people's council.    Then Nguyen Van Yeu, member of the National Assembly  Secretariat, on behalf of the law drafting committee, the  investigation committee, and the National Assembly Secretariat  read a report compiling National Assembly deputies' views on  amendments to Chapter Two of the revised law on the organization  of people's councils and people's committees.    After Deputies Le Duc Binh of Ninh Binh, Phan Quang of Thai  Binh, Nguyen Thanh Chuong of Thanh Hoa, Ha Thai Binh of Soc  Trang, Ma Dien Cu of Binh Thuan, Y Ngong Niek Dam of Dac Lac, Vo  Nguyen Quang of Thua Thien-Hue, Tran Thi Le Thu of Binh Dinh,  and Phan Minh Tanh of Dong Thap completed their statements, the  National Assembly voted to pass Chapter Two before passing the  entire text of the revised law on the organization of people's  councils and people's committees.    The revised law on the organization of people's councils and  people's committees and the revised law on election of people's  councils that have been passed by the National Assembly are the  two important laws that help to revamp in one step the  organization and activity of the people's councils and people's  committees at all levels. These two laws will help to further  perfect the legislative system for the organization of the  administration mechanism.    On 22 June, the National Assembly will work in the  conference  hall.</p>

			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Survey of Istanbul and the Olympics (3): The tension with Ankara - Olympic bid may have impact on local government ISTANBUL is a society with its own traditions formed over centuries. But it is also regarded with a proprietorial eye by the rest of the country for which it serves as a commercial and cultural hub. As national politicians in far-away Ankara are all too aware, what happens in Istanbul matters to people in the most remote corner of Turkey. In practice, this means that central government has been reluctant to lose control of a city that generates some 40 per cent of the nation's tax revenue and a similar proportion of GNP. Yet with a population estimated unofficially at over 9m, it is clearly impossible to administer a city of Istanbul's size and complex topography by remote control. A jaundiced view of the city's history over the last 45 years lights on the tension between a capital anxious to get its hands both on the wealth and political credit which the city generates and the efforts of local politicians to reinvest it locally. Such a description, however, fails to take account of the major attempts to reorganise local administration in Turkey - both in the early 1960s when cities first elected their mayors democratically at the ballot box and more recently during the 1980s when large municipalities like Istanbul were given an additional tier of elected government. Indeed, one frequent argument heard in support of Istanbul's Olympic bid is that it would concentrate the minds of Turkey's politicians, who even now are contemplating further radical re-organisation to cope with the additional demands for amenities and services by the year 2000. Historically, a centrally organised provincial government has been a safety net for a local government which did not have ready access to revenue for capital projects or technical expertise. In practice, administrative tutelage, the right of Ankara at one stage to control even low-level appointees, acted as a check on local autonomy. For Ankara politicians, getting too close to the source of the country's wealth has its risks. Adnan Menderes, the Democrat prime minister, became personally involved in the reshaping of Istanbul, cutting boulevards through neighbourhoods with a scant regard for niceties that helped to fill the charge sheet when he was overthrown by the military in 1960 and later tried and hanged. It took Ataturk eight years to return to Istanbul after he fled to join the nationalist cause. Towards the end of his term as prime minister, the Ozal government seemed to be there most weekends. Was it mere coincidence that it was then the press began to accuse the late Turgut Ozal of dynastic ambitions? 'Everyone is trying to get their bit of the city,' according to Mr Tugrul Erkin, who serves as general secretary to the mayor. Building regulations particularly on the scenic Bosporus appear to be iron tight. Mr Ishak Alaton, joint head of Alarko Holding, and Mr Erkin's former private sector boss, complains it is easier to get planning permission in Moscow than Istanbul. Yet the popular belief is that patience brings massive rewards - a determined and well-connected speculator will find a gap between the overlapping tiers of state and local authorities. The rewards for catering to the expanding needs of a city that doubles in size every 15 years are so great that according to Mr Hari Kozakcioglu, the current governor, the contractors will fall over themselves to build the Olympic venues for free in exchange for the right to develop the adjacent properties. Mr Kozakcioglu's own office is the subject of much discussion. Should Istanbul be hived into Asian and European sides or should the authority of the governor's office be expanded, making Istanbul virtually a state within a state? This follows from the major local re-organisation after 1983, when many of the basic elements of urban administration, including the creation and enforcement of its own master plan, were given to the newly elected Greater Istanbul Municipality. The assumption was that the city with its large tax base and ready supply of human resources could cope. Responsibility for a variety of day-to-day services was entrusted to 15 newly formed district municipalities. At the same time, central administration remained represented in the person of the governor, a professional bureaucrat appointed centrally. The governor's office also retained responsibility for items like policing and education. The truth is that although the mayor of Istanbul enjoys the largest personal popular vote of any politician in the country, governing the city is a political graveyard. Mr Bedrettin Dalan, the last mayor but one, was seen to be a victim of his own ability to get things done, a rising star whom Turgut Ozal, then prime minister, felt obliged to shoot down. The electorate, however, failed to distinguish their loyalties. In the 1989 municipal election Mr Dalan fell victim to the unpopularity of the Ozal government and was hounded from office. His Social Democrat successor, Mr Nurettin Sozen, may fare no better in the election scheduled for March 1994. This would be particularly ironic given that Mr Murat Karayalcin, the mayor of Ankara, is widely tipped to succeed as head of the Social Democratic People's party this autumn. Mr Karayalcin is probably no better at muddling through, but in Ankara, a city at the heart of the political machine, with a population of 4m rather than Istanbul's 10m, it is always easier to make one's mark.</p>

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Interest depresses Stat-Plus A DROP IN interest income led to a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.02m to Pounds 1.82m at Stat-Plus group in the first half of 1993. The group sells legal stationery, printing and law forms publishing. Sales in the half year were broadly unchanged at Pounds 6.03m while operating profit rose 7 per cent to Pounds 1.39m. Gross margins were maintained and overheads reduced, leading to a considerable improvement overall to the final six months of 1992. The outlook for the remainder of the year would depend to a considerable degree on the speed of the recovery in the housing market. Cash deposits stood at Pounds 13.8m. Earnings per share came to 5.7p (6.3p) but the interim dividend is stepped up to 4p (3.56p).</p>

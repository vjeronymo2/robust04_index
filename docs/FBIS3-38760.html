			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Marc Paoloni in Brussels: "France Sends New </F> Signal To Beijing"]    [Text] Paris has just made a discreet, new gesture  favorable to Beijing. Breaking with its rather protectionist  tradition, France has come out in favor of imposing import  quotas on a minimum amount of Chinese products. To the great  displeasure of some of its traditional trading partners, notably  Spain, the French foreign minister will probably vote with the  "liberal" countries on 7 February in Brussels to liberalize  trade between the EC and China.    The "Chinese quotas" issue conceals the wider problem of the  single-market-inspired requirement to replace national quotas  imposed on state-controlled countries with EC quotas. In actual  fact, because of the GATT membership of many of the countries in  the former Communist bloc and the bilateral agreements concluded  between certain other countries and the EC, the only thing left  for discussion are the some 6,000 quotas imposed on China.  Eliminating these quotas raises the question of the number and  volume of EC quotas to be set up in their place. The Commission  proposed nine categories of products: gloves, shoes, china,  ceramics, glass articles, radios, toys, bicycles, and  chloramphenicol. France has aligned itself with the liberal  countries, which have suggested limiting these categories to  seven.  <H5>  Toward Conciliatory Attitude by Germany </H5>   This would appear to be a doubly profitable choice since it  seems to have enabled Paris to ensure a conciliatory attitude by  Bonn next Monday -- barring any surprises -- on one aspect of  the Union's new "trade defense" device, which was left out of  the political compromise reached on this issue last 15 December:  the decisionmaking mechanism within the EC regarding procedures  for settling GATT trade disputes and for "managing" arbitration.    In actual fact, all these issues are linked. It will be up  to the ministers to adopt the legislative texts on 7 February  that will transform the political agreement reached in  mid-December -- in the margins of the Uruguay Round -- in order  to strengthen the Community's trade defense instruments. This  involves the improvement of antidumping and antisubsidy measures  and the implementation of safeguard clauses, thereby  accelerating retaliation and making it less dependent on  majorities that cannot be reached among the Twelve. With regard  to the "new trade policy instrument" -- which is supposed to  allow Europeans to retaliate against unfair practices on the  world market but which in reality is never used -- it was merely  agreed that if the other members of GATT did not abrogate their  unilateral retaliatory weapons -- in this case the United States  and section 301 of its trade legislation -- then the Twelve  would take "the appropriate steps."</p>

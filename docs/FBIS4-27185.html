			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- British Trade Minister  Richard Needham called for Japanese support Tuesday [31 May] in  a campaign to boost the entry of British companies into the  Japanese market, Foreign Ministry officials said.    In a meeting with Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, Needham  called for Japan to support the "action Japan" campaign, the  third such campaign by Britain to boost trade with Japan, the  officials said.    The "action Japan" campaign aims at offering advice and  specific information on 10 industrial sectors in the Japanese  market to British companies, they said.    Needham also vowed to try to deepen British firms'  understanding of the Japanese market and to "constructively"  solve the trade imbalance with Japan, they said.    Kakizawa told Needham that Japan intends to support the  British efforts as much as possible and pointed to the need for  cooperation by both Japanese and British companies in the world  to strengthen bilateral economic ties, the officials said.    Needham arrived in Japan on Monday to promote the trade  campaign. He is scheduled to leave Japan for Taiwan on Tuesday.</p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Call for more aid to east Europe POLITICAL and economic instability could worsen in eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States if western finance for urgent infrastructural investment is not increased, Mr Percy Barnevik, president of Asea Brown Boveri, warned yesterday. At the annual results meeting of the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, Mr Barnevik urged increased western support for such projects and, especially, spending to boost nuclear power station safety. Referring to President Bush's response to the economic needs of the former Soviet Union and eastern bloc countries, Mr Barnevik said: 'My advice to Europe's politicians is: forget about America. This is a European matter'. Some Dollars 20bn-Dollars 60bn was needed to correct a huge 'safety deficiency' at the 60 east European nuclear stations. Of these, the 16 oldest Chernobyl-type stations were beyond rescue; it was unlikely another 10 could be upgraded to western standards without heavy investment. For the rest, 'fast, urgent safety measures' were needed. For countries dependent on nuclear power for up to 50 per cent of their needs, such as Bulgaria, gas turbines should be made available quickly. Estonia should receive western finance to switch from making electricity from oil shale, a 'terrible way to produce it'; 15 per cent of Estonia's land surface had been destroyed in this way. The shortage of western aid is the main reason for ABB's discouraging view on short-term business prospects in eastern Europe. But Mr Barnevik remains convinced a huge long-term demand exists.

			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Council shake-up in Surrey urged Surrey County Council should be abolished and replaced by all-purpose unitary authorities, The Local Government Commission recommended yesterday. The commission proposed a similar fate for Hereford and Worcester County Council, and in its report on Nottinghamshire it recommended that Nottingham become self-governing. The commission's decision to favour retention of the status quo of two-tier counties and districts as an option in all three counties suggested further conflict with the government's desire for unitary authorities. The recommendations were: Surrey: A choice is offered between a new five-unitary structure, with boundaries almost totally different from those of the present districts, or keeping the status quo. The preferred option is to create five unitaries, although the commission makes pessimistic forecasts on costs. Set-up costs would be between Pounds 40m and Pounds 44m and annual savings would be between Pounds 5m and Pounds 1m. It could take 44 years to recoup reorganisation costs. The five unitaries would be: Epsom Downs, based on Epsom and Ewell District Council, plus Esher, Leatherhead and Banstead; North Surrey, based on Spelthorne borough, plus Weybridge; North West Surrey, a merged Surrey Heath, Runnymede and Woking boroughs; South East Surrey, based on Tandridge district, plus southern parts of Mole Valley and Reigate and Banstead boroughs; South West Surrey, based on a merger of Guildford and Waverley. Hereford and Worcester: Herefordshire to re-appear on the local government map after an absence of 20 years. The commission, reflecting the view of all local authorities in Hereford and Worcester, recommends that Herefordshire be a unitary authority. Worcestershire should be split into two unitary authorities, north and south. Local authorities are divided on this. The county is prepared to accept two unitary authorities if two tiers of government were not kept, while the districts want Worcestershire split into five unitary authorities. In addition to its preferred option, the commission will consult on plans for a single Worcestershire unitary council or for the present arrangements  -a county council, five district councils and one new district council. The commission estimates that if Hereford and Worcester were split into three, transitional costs would be up to Pounds 26m, with annual savings of Pounds 4m to Pounds 7m. Nottinghamshire: The city of Nottingham should have its own unitary authority but the rest of Nottinghamshire should retain two tiers of local government. Mr David Thomas, commissioner responsible for the county, said: 'We have found the Notts review very difficult.' The eight local authorities and the county council all held to stances designed to protect their position, and could not agree on a list of options. Nor has the commission been able to find a regular pulse of public opinion. Mr Thomas said: 'The people seeking change are about the same number as those wanting the status quo.' Although the commission has not found a satisfactory case for change outside Nottingham, it is offering options of seven unitary authorities or four unitary authorities.</p>

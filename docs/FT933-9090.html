			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Tension high as Nigeria braces for protests: Stay-aways and demonstrations have been called across the country THE SENSE of foreboding is almost palpable as Nigeria prepares for three days of protest which could as easily tilt the country towards instability as thrust it towards democracy. Armed soldiers were posted at main intersections in Lagos yesterday. Shops and offices closed early. Every bus heading out of Lagos was laden as thousands of workers sent families and belongings to the safety of their home towns and villages before the campaign gets underway today. Infuriated by President Ibrahim Babangida's annulment of the June 12 presidential poll, the Campaign for Democracy - an informal coalition led by civil rights activists, has called for a protest without precedent in the country's post independence history. Stay-aways, rallies and acts of civil disobedience have been called across the country, to press home demands that General Babangida fulfil his pledge to hand over to an elected civilian government on August 27. Campaign organisers said yesterday the protests would go ahead despite the government's threat to impose a state of emergency. 'The protests are still on,' said Mr Livinus Ede, a CD official. 'The government statement has nothing to do with it.' But the days ahead could demonstrate the vulnerability of the opposition rather than undermine the position of a seemingly intransigent general, either wedded to power or fearful of the consequences of surrendering it. The protests so far have been loud, but discordant. The two permitted opposition parties are weak, the poorly organised trade union movement faces high unemployment, the civil rights campaigners have few resources. The ex-generals who have joined in the call for Gen Babangida to step down, fear the bloody consequences of confrontation. For all those contemplating action, the memory of the the civil war over Biafra in the 1960s may mute the protest. The carnage and starvation that cost hundreds of thousands of lives may be history, but the spectre of secession is real even to the post-war generation. Whether Yoruba people from the south, Ibo from the east, Hausa-Fulani from the north, or a member of a minority tribe required by realpolitik to take sides, the fragility of the Nigerian federation remains an abiding concern. All the main opposition players - leaders of the Social Democratic party, the National Republican Convention, and retired General Olusegun Obasanjo, head of state from 1976 to 1979 and chairman of the Association for Democracy - are aware of this fragility. The ethnic and religious fault line which could split Nigeria is blurred, as the presidential poll showed. Chief Moshood Abiola, the SDP's victorious presidential candidate, is Yoruba, but a Moslem, and has his stronghold in the south but won substantial support in the north. Nevertheless, in times of stress the fault line runs between the largely Christian south and the predominantly Moslem north, with both sides aware that the vital asset is the oil in the east, responsible for over 90 per cent of Nigeria's export earnings. It is partly with these concerns in mind that the two main opposition parties are holding back from the latest campaign. A similar call for protests last month ended in violence in which up to 100 people died. At the same, the opposition parties are intrinsically weak. Both were created by the government. Neither has a distinct ideology, nor can they generate mass appeal. In the meantime, the SDP's leader is out of the country. Mr Abiola is in the US rallying support for his presidency, and while he is away there is little focus for resistance. The deciding factor in the critical days ahead may be the role of the unions. But they seem reluctant to act now, preferring instead to wait and see what happens on August 27. The Nigeria Labour Congress has indicated that it is prepared to call a national strike if there is no handover, a threat backed up yesterday by Nigeria's biggest oil workers' union. The organisers of this week's campaign, however, believe that pressure must be exerted now if Gen Babangida is to fulfil his promise. The exasperation of many Nigerians with these and other divisions and uncertainties in the opposition ranks has brought respected non-partisan national figures into the fray. Most notable is Mr Obasanjo, who became the only Nigerian president to give up power voluntarily when he ended 15 years of military rule in 1979. The former general has done more than anyone in Nigeria to make clear to Mr Babangida that his time in office has run out. Having campaigned vigorously to persuade northern traditional rulers that the issue transcends old rivalries, Mr Obasanjo seems to be throwing his weight behind the civilian protest. Near his farm in Otta near Lagos Mr Obasanjo holds meetings with a small group of other former heads of state, generals and well known critics of the regime. In a speech last Monday, he stressed: 'The current political crisis is not an ethnic or religious issue. 'As long as the military are at the helm,' he went on, 'democracy and good governance elude us.'</p>

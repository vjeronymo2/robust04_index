			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Vodafone lifts paging side with Air Call buy VODAFONE, the mobile communications company, has become the UK's second largest paging operator with its purchase of Air Call Holdings from BellSouth Enterprises, the US telecoms company. The purchase, for an undisclosed sum, almost doubles the subscriber base of Vodapage, Vodafone's paging subsidiary. With about 200,000 paging subscribers, Vodafone now has more than a quarter of the UK paging market, ahead of Mercury with about 15 per cent. BT dominates the market with a 55 per cent share. Air Call - with 350 employees and headquarters in Welwyn Garden City - will be run by Vodafone as a separate concern in the short term, but will be fully integrated with Vodapage in due course. The takeover is a further stage in the rationalisation of the UK's lacklustre paging sector. The number of operators has reduced from six to four in the last two years, the fourth being Hutchison Paging. The four are all significant forces in the cellular mobile industry. Vodafone is the market leader; BT has a majority stake in Cellnet; Cable and Wireless, Mercury's parent, has a half share in One-2-One; and Hutchison has a telepoint service and will launch a PCN cellular network next year. The UK has about 750,000 paging subscribers, against 1.6m cellular mobile subscribers. CIT Research, the telecoms consultancy, expects the UK paging market to grow at about 2 per cent a year over the next decade, far slower than the cellular market.</p>

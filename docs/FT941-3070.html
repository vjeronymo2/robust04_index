			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / International Company News: JP Morgan to support Banesto rescue scheme A potential obstacle for the rescue plan being mounted for Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto) was removed yesterday when J. P. Morgan of the US confirmed it would support the scheme at a shareholders' meeting on March 26. The restructuring plan drawn up by the Bank of Spain means that the 7.9 per cent stake held by J. P. Morgan-managed Corsair Fund, the largest single shareholding in the bank, will be diluted to 4.5 per cent as a result of the writing down of the nominal share value from Pta700 to Pta400. J. P. Morgan advised the former Banesto chairman Mr Mario Conde, who was dismissed by the Bank of Spain in December after inspectors found the bank had greatly over-valued its assets. Auditors have calculated the 'hole' in Banesto's balance sheet at Pta605bn (Dollars 4.36bn). The US bank said it had not yet decided whether to make a further investment in Banesto following the capitalisation plan in order to restore the size of its holding.</p>

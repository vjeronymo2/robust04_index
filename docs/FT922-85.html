			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Business invests its hopes in Ramos presidency: Businessmen in the Philippines look forward to growth and stability PHILIPPINE business is hoping that the presidency of Mr Fidel Ramos, who takes his oath of office today, will usher in a period of economic stability and growth. Mr Enrique Esteban, president of the independent think-tank Centre for Research and Communication, said that with the election of Mr Ramos, 'there is so much hope now getting into the system'. However, Mr Jose Pardo, president of the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry, warned that power shortages, dramatised by daily cuts lasting three to four hours and estimated to have cost more than Dollars 740m (Pounds 400m) since March, could dampen the kind of investor enthusiasm predicted by Mr Esteban. Mr Pardo said business planned to 'work together' with the new administration to 'uplift economic well-being in the country and lower the incidence of poverty' by recommending 'do-able' policies and programmes for the planning process. Even before Mr Ramos was formally proclaimed as the winning presidential candidate, the PCCI had organised a meeting with him during which 10 'priority' concerns were identified and about 50 'action programmes' recommended. In many of these recommendations, 'direct presidential involvement' was sought to facilitate action. The business leaders particularly asked Mr Ramos to oversee moves to tackle the power shortage and corruption in government. Mr Ramos's cabinet appointments appear generally acceptable to business. His economic team will be led by Mr Ramon del Rosario, finance secretary, and Mr Rizalino Navarro, trade and industry secretary. Mr del Rosario is head of Asian Bank, a medium-sized commercial bank, and Mr Navarro is head of the accounting and management-consultancy group SyCip, Gorres and Telayo, which has operations in other Asian countries. Mr Ramos has retained Mr Jose Cuisia as governor of the Central Bank of the Philippines. Mr Peter Garrucho, former trade secretary and Mr Ramos's campaign manager in the election, was named acting executive secretary and presidential adviser on energy affairs. These key members of Mr Ramos's economic team are known advocates of free-market concepts, even during the authoritarian rule of the late Mr Ferdinand Marcos. It is expected they will oversee the transition towards greater liberalisation of the economy. Mr Ramos's predecessor, Mrs Corazon Aquino, while largely failing to push through her expensive land redistribution programme, had begun the task of liberalising trade and investment, ending currency restrictions and breaking up the Marcos-era monopolies. The government currently projects gross national product growth this year of 2.5-3 per cent after zero growth last year. Growth in the last quarter of 1991 'turned slightly positive', compared with a 3.1 per cent third-quarter fall. Inflation, hovering at 8 per cent, is likely to stabilise at its target of 7 per cent for the year. The exchange rate remains steady, as international reserves remain high, despite a surge in demand for dollars after the lifting of the import levy on April 30. Mr Emmanuel Pelaez, ambassador to the US and former Philippines vice-president, will be chief debt negotiator. More than 20 per cent of the country's export earnings go to pay its Dollars 29bn foreign debt. To make matters worse, Washington recently reduced aid to Manila from Dollars 568m last year to Dollars 220m for next year. The government must also prepare the business community for the crucial adjustments necessary for the planned creation of an Asean Free Trade Area that will expose local industries to international competition but give them access to wider markets.</p>

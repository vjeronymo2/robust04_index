			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Tokyo NHK General Television Network in  Japanese at 0000 GMT on 15 May broadcasts a live, 60-minute  roundtable discussion: "Rights and Wrongs of Tax Increases and  Reductions." Roundtable participants include Hirohisa Fujii,  finance minister; Kozo Watanabe; acting chief secretary of  Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party); Ryutaro Hashimoto, policy  research council chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP);  Koken Nosaka, Diet administration committee chairman of the  Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ); and Iwao Nakatani,  professor at Hitotsubashi University. The program is moderated  by NHK commentator Takashi Yamamoto.    The discussion begins with Yamamoto asking Finance Minister  Fujii whether Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata was referring to a  consumption tax hike when he recently said that the government  would create a balanced tax system by reviewing income and  consumption taxes. After noting that various measures have been  discussed to promote tax reform, Fujii says: "His remarks meant  that the government will rectify overly heavy reliance on income  taxes." He admits that it also means the review of the ratios  of direct and indirect taxation. Concerning the government's  attempt to draft a concrete tax reform plan during June,  Shinseito's Watanabe notes that there are strong hopes for  compiling the plan on schedule, while the SDPJ's Nosaka predicts  that it will be difficult for the government to draft such plans  by the end of June. The LDP's Hashimoto says the government has  not exerted efforts to gain public understanding on the planned  tax reform. When asked why the government should set a deadline  for formulating concrete reform plans, Fujii stresses that the  tax reform is being studied as a measure not to implement tax  cuts but to cope with the graying of society. He says: "Our  goal is to draft concrete plans by the end of June, or if this  is impossible, by the end of the year." Professor Nakatani,  however, expresses doubts about the effectiveness of a  government plan to implement a tax hike and reduction at the  same time, and about the necessity of hastily formulating the  tax reform plan in time for a Japan-U.S. summit meeting and the  Naples summit in July. In this connection, Fujii notes the need  for the government to secure financial sources to fund tax cuts,  suggesting the simultaneous implementation of a tax hike and  reduction. He adds: "The government is considering  implementing multi-year -- not single-year -- tax cuts and  taking necessary measures to carry out the cuts."    Hashimoto criticizes the government for examining only tax  reform as a means to cope with the aging of society, saying that  the government must view the nation's burden in terms of taxes  and social security premiums as a whole. He also chides the  government for having raised fees on many public utilities,  claiming the increased fees will reduce the effects of tax cuts  on the economy.    Nosaka stresses that the government should promote tax  reform  after gaining the people's understanding. Commenting on this,  Fujii promises utmost efforts to gain public understanding,  saying: "Reform will not be implemented without the support of  the general public -- in particular, without the support of Diet  members of each political party." Also, referring to  Hashimoto's call for reviewing not only the tax burden but also  the burden of social security premiums, Fujii says that while  taking this into consideration, the government will make efforts  to gain the understanding of the people. The roundtable  participants then discuss what the government should do to gain  popular understanding. Hashimoto asks the government to take  enough time to listen to the opinions of the people. Fujii  agrees with him, saying it is a matter of course for the  government to hear public opinions. Asked about whether the  ruling coalition will seek out the opinions of opposition  parties in the process of formulating the tax reform plan,  Shinseito's Watanabe says: "We will naturally do so. The plan  will amount to nothing if it is scrapped in the Diet."    Explaining the SDPJ's position on tax reform, Nosaka says:  "We think that it is inevitable for the government to first  consider increasing the ratio of indirect taxation and  establishing a new tax to finance income tax cuts."    In answering a question on whether the ruling coalition  plans  to specify the size and timing of a tax increase in its tax  reform plan, Watanabe notes the need for the coalition to seek  the support of the LDP and the SDPJ, again saying the plan will  amount to nothing unless it is adopted in the Diet.    Turning to administrative reform, Nosaka says that although  the government is calling on the private sector to promote  restructuring, it has to restructure itself as well. Asked if  the government can compile effective deregulation measures for  administrative reform by the end of June, Fujii, while stressing  the importance of administrative reform, says: "Deregulation is  very important from an international point of view and in light  of the need to transform Japan's economic structure. The  government is dealing with deregulation with these points in  mind." However, Professor Nakatani questions the effectiveness  of deregulation measures currently being studied by the  government, saying that with these measures, the government will  not be able to open Japanese markets wider and promote  deregulation fully enough to satisfy the people and other  countries. He points out that if the government can lessen the  differences between domestic and overseas prices by promoting  deregulation, domestic demand will increase greatly. Fujii  agrees with Nakatani, saying that what the latter said is very  important. Meanwhile, noting areas in which he believes the  government should promote deregulation, Hashimoto urges a review  of the country's systems of standardization and validation,  referred to as non-tariff barriers by other countries, to meet  the expectations of the United States and other nations. He  also stresses: "To promote deregulation, it is necessary to  strengthen the power of the Fair Trade Commission (FTC).  Otherwise, the FTC will not be able to cope with such unfair  business practices as dumping." The SDPJ's Nosaka also stresses  the importance of deregulation, saying: "While taking into  account Japan's huge trade surplus with the United States, the  government should promote regulation in such a way that it  abolishes unnecessary regulations and maintains necessary ones."</p>

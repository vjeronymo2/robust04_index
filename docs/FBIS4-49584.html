			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Zhu Jianhong (2612 0494 5725) and </F> XINHUA reporter Tang Hong (0781 5725)]    [Text] Beijing, 13 Apr (XINHUA) -- Since China started the  production permit system 10 years ago, the system has fully  played its role of ensuring good quality products and helping to  implement industrial policies. Li Chuanqing, State Bureau of  Technological Supervision director, announced recently: In the  future, the production permit system will be applicable to fewer  products -- only the products which are subject to government  policy restrictions --, and the number of restricted products  will be reduced to around 100 from more than 280 at present.    With the brisk market in China in the early eighties, a  large  number of poorly equipped, poorly staffed, and poorly managed  enterprises emerged in China. Their products were inferior,  frequently causing bad accidents. In April 1984, the State  Council promulgated the "Interim Regulations on Production  Permits for Industrial Products" which is applicable to  important industrial products.    Over last 10 years, the enterprises operating with a  production permit have generally raised their awareness of  quality, improved basic work, and effectively ensured good  quality of their products. According to incomplete statistics,  enterprises in Shanghai's electronics industry alone had to  invest a total of nearly 10 million yuan in buying production  and testing instruments and improving the production environment  before they were given a production permit. Better technology  remarkably improves the quality of products. For instance,  motor-driven threshers and fire extinguishers caused many deaths  and injuries before the start of the production permit system,  and much less accidents have been caused by them since the start  of the system. According to State Bureau of Technological  Supervision statistics , the up-to-standard ratio of products  subject to the production permit control averaged approximately  50 percent before an enterprise obtained a production permit,  and the ratio has increased by 30 percentage points after the  enterprise obtained the permit. The production permit system  has effectively improved the management of various trades. For  instance, the issuance of production permits has enabled the  cement industry to know more about its enterprises. While more  than 6,000 cement enterprises have obtained production permits,  some 1,000 small plants have been eliminated due to poor  production conditions. So, the overall technological level of  the cement industry has been raised.    While practicing the production permit system, the State  Bureau of Technological Supervision and other departments  investigate and punish the controlled products produced without  a permit, so as to protect the consumers' interests. For  instance, disposable syringes are a product concerning human  life. More than 2,000 households in a Jinxian County town in  Jiangxi Province, were aroused to produce them, and most of them  did not have the necessary technology, equipment, or test  instruments. Their substandard products caused many bad medical  accidents. Working together, the State Bureau of Technological  Supervision, the State Pharmaceutical Administration, and  departments concerned with Jiangxi Province have destroyed 600  sets of inferior products, closed down more than 300 factories  which operated without a permit, and have begun to stop the  trend of production without a permit.</p>

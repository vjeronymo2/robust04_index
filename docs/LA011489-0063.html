			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 24-HOUR L.A.: THE NIGHT OWL'S GUIDE  </P> <P> While New York has long been heralded as "the city that doesn't sleep," the Los  Angeles area has its share of all-night life, too.  </P> <P> Though it may not be bustling with the a.m. overflow of its Eastern  counterpart, Los Angeles can't be discounted as dead from midnight to 6 a.m. In  addition to the requisite convenience stores, supermarkets, coffee shops and  gas stations, there are some unusual spots that are open around the clock.  </P> <P> There are many others, but here are a few of the wide-awake hangouts where  night owls can be found in the wee hours of morning:  </P> <P> Tennis, anyone? -- Merchant of Tennis, 1118 S. La Cienega Blvd., (213)  855-1946. If you're in the mood for a Wimbledon tuneup in the wee hours, this  tennis shop/court complex has available two concrete courts any time -- day or  night. However, reservations must be made during store hours, which are  Monday-Friday, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., and Saturday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Court time  costs $7 per hour during the week, $10 during the weekend.

There are 12 pool tables (with more to be installed early in  the year), six billiard tables and three snooker tables, including one that  measures 6x12 feet. A parking lot is adjacent to the building. Playing time for  two players starts at $2.60 per player per hour; when more than two play,  individual rates decrease.

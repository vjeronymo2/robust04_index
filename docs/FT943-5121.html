			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Recycling may cost less than forecast Recyling an extra 25 per cent of domestic packaging waste would cost Pounds 100m and add just 1p to every Pounds 10 spent by consumers, according to the preliminary findings of a report by the Producer Responsibility Group. The PRG says estimates that industry could face Pounds 500m a year in extra costs, which would increase inflation by 0.5 per cent if passed on to consumers, are exaggerated. A weekly shopping basket costing Pounds 50 would increase by 5p, adding no more than 0.2 per cent to inflation. The PRG is headed by Sir Sydney Lipworth, a former chairman of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, and members include J. Sainsbury, Boots, Asda and Tesco. The group was formed early in 1993 after Mr John Gummer, then environment secretary, asked retailers and other industries in the packaging chain to come up with a scheme to recycle an extra 25 per cent of packaging waste, mainly from the domestic sector. It was intended that the packaging industry would bear the costs, possibly through a levy. The extra 25 per cent of recycling from the domestic sector would complement industrial recyling and mean that between 50 per cent and 75 per cent of total packaging waste would be recycled. 'The final report is due out next month, but I do not think it will find the levy would amount to Pounds 500m,' a PRG spokesman said.</p>

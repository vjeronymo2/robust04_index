			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] This evening, the assembly of the republic of  Srpska meeting in Bijeljina ended its discussion on the platform  of the Serbian delegation for the peace talks in Geneva tomorrow  [18 January]. At the end of the session, Nikola Koljevic, vice  president of the republic of Srpska, made a statement for  Belgrade Radio's special correspondent Milorad Denda:    [Denda] Professor Koljevic, what did today's session of the  assembly of the Serbian Republic conclude?    [Koljevic] Today's session on the platform for the peace  agreement concluded that the delegation of the republic of  Srpska will once again offer in Geneva what the Serbian side has  been asked to offer in the past, namely territorial concessions,  and the administration of the district of Sarajevo, under  specific conditions agreed upon during the negotiations.  However, considering the public statements by the Sarajevo  Presidency, especially by Messrs. Izetbegovic and Ganic, the  assembly has adopted another platform in case the Muslim side  does not accept the proffered peace agreement.    This platform will be revealed, that is presented, in Geneva  tomorrow, and the general conclusion, if I may say so, is  unanimous and undivided that if the Muslim side does not want  the agreement on these bases, the representatives of the  republic of Srpska will take a very specific and definitive  stand that will lead toward the affirmation of the republic of  Srpska on completely new bases.    [Denda] Can you be more specific about these new bases?    [Koljevic] These bases will be discussed, or rather the  platform itself deals with these bases. The most important  element for these bases is that we will proceed with the demand  for a cease-fire and the de facto situation on the ground.</p>

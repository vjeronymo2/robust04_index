			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / International Company News: IBM spins off unit with Zschau as its chairman INTERNATIONAL Business Machines has spun off Adstar, its data storage business unit, and appointed Mr Ed Zschau, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur and politician as chairman and chief executive. Mr Zschau is a former Republican Congressman and founder of System Industries, a data storage systems company. He will oversee Adstar's business strategy and financial performance. He has been made an IBM vice-president. The move represents a step forward in IBM's plans to transform itself into a federation of independent business units. However, Mr Jack Kuehler, IBM vice-chairman, said it should not be seen as presaging a public offering of Adstar stock. Adstar is one of IBM's most important business units, with 1992 sales of Dollars 6.1bn and net earnings, before restructuring charges, of Dollars 247m. At the end of 1992, it employed almost 16,000 people at plants in the US, Europe and Asia. As a stand-alone business it is the largest manufacturer of data storage products. This is IBM's first restructuring decision since the arrival of Mr Louis Gerstner, who took up his post as IBM chair-man and chief executive on April 1. The appointment of an outsider to head an IBM business unit is unprecedented. It suggests that Mr Gerstner, himself the first non-IBM executive to be elected chairman, may be looking outside IBM to fill leading posts. Mr Zschau said that his goal at Adstar would be to 'revolutionise the information storage industry and achieve exceptional commercial success. 'With entrepreneurial spirit, we'll create new products and new markets and move faster to leverage Adstar's unique resources.'</p>

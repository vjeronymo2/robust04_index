			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Markets Report: Dollar decline continues The dollar continued its relentless decline on foreign exchanges yesterday as hopes dimmed of the Federal Reserve raising US interest rates, writes Philip Gawith. June producer price inflation was much more subdued than the market had expected, and this dampened hopes of tighter monetary policy which might have helped the dollar. The dollar closed at new lows in London against the yen and the D-Mark, finishing at DM1.5235 from DM1.54, and Y96.8050 from Y97.365. After fairly quiet European trading, the US currency started to slide when US markets opened. The PPI data were followed by comments from Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, which appeared to underline the resolve of Group of Seven nations not to be drawn into a defence of the dollar. The weakness of the dollar continued to exert a downward drag on sterling which fell to its lowest level against the D-Mark since shortly after Britain's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism. The UK currency closed in London more than a pfennig lower at DM2.3958 from DM2.4081 on Monday. Against the dollar it finished at Dollars 1.5725 from Dollars 1.5638. The sterling index fell to 78.8 from 79. In Europe the D-Mark gave up some of its recent gains, finishing slightly lower against the Belgian and French francs, the Italian lira and the Swedish krona. Despite the continuing decline of the dollar, analysts said there had been no sign of central bank intervention. The impression that politicians intend standing back was bolstered by Mr Waigel's comments after meeting Mr Clinton. 'The economic fundamentals are in order in the US. The agreement by the finance ministers (leaving the level of the dollar to the market) was the correct way. The US has inflation under control and good growth. These are convincing signs for a stable dollar,' he told reporters. These assurances were ignored in the market. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, said there had been heavy selling of the dollar by US funds - including hedge funds and institutional investors - who had previously been very bullish about the dollar. He said it was only since Friday that these funds had been seen in the market. With the dollar having fallen by twelve pfennigs over the last month - half of the fall coming since Friday - Mr MacKinnon said that his forecasts, which have been in the bear camp, had been telescoped. He said a revisiting of the all time low against the D-Mark of DM1.38, which he had forecast as a medium term event, was now 'within hailing distance'. Most analysts are expecting the dollar to decline further. Mr Mark Oliver, spot trading manager at Midland Global Markets, comments: 'The problem for the dollar is that once the market feels a trend is there, there is very little that can stop it unless it gets overbought or oversold.' Mr Oliver believes that many customers have failed to follow the downward movement of prices and are still sitting on long dollar positions. Only when the market has got short of dollars can a rebound of any duration be predicted. Sterling's weakness was further evidence of the currency's close ties to the dollar. Mr Tony Norfield, UK Treasury economist at ABN-AMRO, said a study of Pounds /DM movements over the past six months showed that 95 per cent of them could be explained by movements in the Dollars /DM rate. 'Sterling has not really got an independent life of its own,' said Mr Norfield. The UK currency tends to fall by a ratio of 1:2 compared to the US currency. With few immediate reasons for independent sterling strength, Mr Norfield said the currency was likely to remain under pressure. Analysts cautioned against alarmist conclusions, saying the currency would have to fall a lot further before panic measures were resorted to. On its effective index, sterling has traded for most of the last 18 months in the 79-82 range, with a brief spike down to 76 in February 1993, and a brief run up to 83 in January this year. The influx of US and Asian buying into European debt markets helped boost the short end of the interest rate futures markets. The December short sterling contract closed at 93.69 from 93.64, with 23,530 lots traded. Most of the longer contracts chalked up double digit gains. Mr Richard Phillips, analyst at brokers GNI, said the picture was confusing. Last week the fall in sterling had spilled over into selling of short sterling contracts. This week the reverse occurred. Euromark contracts traded heavily, with the December contract trading nearly 51,000 lots to close at 95.09 from 95.08. German call money was unchanged at 4.95/5.05 per cent ahead of today's repo allocation where the rate is expected to fall up to three basis points from 4.93 per cent. In the UK the Bank of England provided money markets with Pounds 774m liquidity after forecasting a Pounds 750m shortage.</p>

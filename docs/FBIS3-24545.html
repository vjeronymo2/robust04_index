Both agents,  which act on lysosomes, inhibited replication of MV when added  with the virus to the cell culture or used to pretreat the cells  before exposure to the virus. Complete inhibition was obtained  with 20-30 mM AC in a dose-dependent fashion, while monensin  gave a maximum yield reduction (&gt;  3 log units) at a  concentration of 5 M. Treatment of the cells with AC 1-2 h  after adsorption was ineffective. Furthermore, blockage by 20 mM  AC was precluded by exposure of the virus-cell surface complex  to pH 4.6 for 10 min to induce membrane fusion. These  observations were interpreted to favor endocytosis as the  mechanism by which MV enters target cells. Figures 3; references  7: (Western).</p>

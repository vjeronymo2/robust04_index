			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Strong dollar heads upwards A CONTINUED surge by the dollar yesterday saw it break through resistance at the DM1.6650 level, and survive three attempts to hold it back against the yen. In late European trading it was carried through DM1.6650 on a rush of large orders in New York, and closed at DM1.6720. It also broke through the Y132 level, to reach Y132.10/20. The third successive day of heavy gains by the dollar had begun with a breach of heavy resistance in the Far East, to take it to a close of DM1.6630 and Y131.50. Dealers said the Bank of Japan had intervened on three separate occasions at Y130.90, Y130.85, and Y131.10/15, but had been unable to hold the dollar down. Its task was not made any easier by comments - which one dealer described as an 'own goal' - by Mr Tsutomu Hata, Japan's deputy finance minister, who remarked that currency intervention was of little use, when the dollar was rising on the back of speculative buying at precisely the same time as the Bank of Japan was selling dollars for yen in the market. Many dealers now feel it would take coordinated action by central banks to halt the dollar's progress. Dollar optimism was unaffected by slightly disappointing US factory orders figures, which showed only a 0.4 per cent rise for January against the 1 per cent expected. But Friday's payroll figures remain a possible dark cloud on the horizon, although market predictions range widely from around a 50,000 fall to a 75,000 increase. 'If Friday's payroll data are are strong they will push the dollar higher still, and then we would be looking at the DM1.70 level,' one economist predicted. High German interest rates have so far limited the dollar's gains against the D-mark, but it is still seen heading towards the DM1.70 barrier, where resistance may be expected. In New York last night the dollar started by largely holding onto its gains, standing at DM1.6710/15 and Y132.05/10 at midsession. The D-mark generally held its ground in the EMS, despite its fall against the dollar. The French franc, against which the D-mark had hit a six-month low on Tuesday, was unable to beat resistance at FFr3.3950, and slipped back to FFr3.3978/79, compared with FFr3.3973/75. The German currency also rose against the Swiss franc to SFr0.9110 from SFr0.9089, with no sign of intervention from the Swiss National Bank. Traders said the Swiss bank's absence was encouraging the market view that the Swiss were prepared to suffer a weaker exchange rate to keep interest rates below German levels. Sterling traded in an extremely tight band against the D-mark, closing at DM2.8825, against DM2.8800 on Tuesday. It dipped towards the close against the dollar, ending at Dollars 1.7235 from a previous close of Dollars 1.7400.</p>

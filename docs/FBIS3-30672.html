During his American visit, Payne, a member of the ruling  Civic Democratic Party (ODS), praised the fact that the  right-wing NECENZUROVANE NOVINY published a list of alleged  secret police agents and collaborators in 1992.    Speaking to local Czech-Americans, Payne said on Tuesday [1  February] that publication of the truth was essential for  purifying society and that the only problem with the list was  that some people were not on it who should have been. No one  was on it who should not have been, he added.    The committee's resolution was initiated by Jan Krycer and  Josef Jezek, Stiborova said.    Payne said that some personal identification numbers  appearing in the list may have been mistyped, adding, "but  basically, when I need to do screening for my personal use, it  is sufficient."    "The committee has agreed that Payne makes speeches and  remarks unknown to the committee," Stiborova said, adding, "thus  what he says are his private views." Payne can only be  dismissed by parliament, Jezek said, adding, "I and most of my  colleagues, believe that Payne can no longer remain committee  chairman."    Payne has made a grave mistake, Jezek said, adding that  Payne  blundered once before in making controversial remarks regarding  relations with Czechs abroad.    "By behaving as they did, the committee gave Payne a chance  for the incident to be forgotten. Just as it was about to be  forgotten, a similar thing happened, and something, I would say,  much more striking."    The committee had no choice but to react so as to "avoid  implicating the whole of parliament and the whole of the Foreign  Committee," Jezek said, adding that both parliament and the  committee must distance themselves from the whole incident as  soon as possible.</p>

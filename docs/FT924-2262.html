			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Survey of Pulp and Paper (1): A self-inflicted wound - The collapse in profitability has been global, as recession and overcapacity cloud the industries THE PULP and paper industry is going through the shredder. Last year it presumed that prices had plumbed the bottom. It was mistaken. The downturn has been deeper and more prolonged than expected. For most groups, margins, prices and profits are still spiralling downward. The main challenge facing the sector is not lack of demand. For most grades that continues to rise. The affliction besetting the industry is self-inflicted - overcapacity. The question is whether this is a normal part of the paper cycle, or a fundamental structural change. The immediate cause of the overcapacity is all too familiar, says Dr Jan Remrod, director general of the Swedish pulp and paper association. 'The good years of the late 1980s stimulated over-investment.' With supply outstripping demand, operating rates have fallen sharply, and with them prices, margins and profits. For some grades of paper, prices have fallen by as much as 40 per cent over the past two years. The collapse in profitability has been global. Sweden's forestry companies expect to make a collective loss this year of SKr2bn (Pounds 193m), compared with a profit only two years ago of SKr12bn. In the US, earnings at International Paper, the world's largest paper company, fell during the second and third quarters this year. Meanwhile, in Japan, Jujo, the third-ranking company, and Sanyo-Kokusaku, fifth-ranked, reported sharp profit falls of 49 per cent and 68 per cent respectively for the last financial year. The plight of paper groups has been aggravated this year by turmoil in the currency markets. European commodity manufacturers suffered particularly from the depreciation of the dollar. Canadian and US manufacturers, faced with poor domestic demand, took advantage of the dollars' weakness to boost imports into Europe, intensifying problems there. 'Many European producers have been hurt as much by the dollar as overcapacity,' says Mr Stephen Zinser, managing director of European paper and packaging at Chase Manhattan Bank. Scandinavian groups have particularly suffered from fluctuating currencies. The decision to float the Finnish markka last September gave a significant push for paper groups there, but placed the Swedes at a meaningful disadvantage. There was near panic among Swedish producers until the Swedish Krona was also devalued in November. The benefits of devaluation were initially considerable. 'It was manna from heaven. It added 10 per cent to 15 per cent to turnover overnight,' says Mr Zinser at Chase Manhattan. He explains that hardly any of the Scandinavians' costs - mostly energy and wood - are dollar-denominated, so little currency-related inflation is imported. Meanwhile, revenues from Swedish-based plants increased immediately, both through currency translation and added volume through more attractive pricing. However, in the medium-term, the benefits are less clear. As exchange-rate benefits work their way through, customers expect some to be passed on to them, driving prices down even further for the rest of the industry, says Mr Denis Christie, paper and pulp analyst at James Capel. In addition, the acquisition binge by Finnish and Swedish groups on the continent, during the late 1980s, has meant devaluations benefit them less than before. Falling prices and the cost of expansion during the late 1980s - both of capacity and acquisitions - have left their mark on paper companies' balance sheets. With a few exceptions, such as KNP of the Netherlands and Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the Franco-British group, paper companies' balance sheets are over-stretched. 'Many groups in Scandinavia have debts greater than their turnover,' admits Mr Timo Teras, senior vice-president of market research and planning at Finncell, the Finnish pulp marketing organisation. Mr Thomas Nysten, managing director of the Finnish paper marketing body Finnpap, says Finnish groups are in more serious financial difficulties than those in other countries, because their capital structures are weaker. Most are now looking to cut their environmental capital spending. The Swedish pulp and paper association reckons Swedish companies have spent SKr30bn on the environment since 1987. 'We are in a position to slow down our environmental expenditure - and that just suits us fine at the moment,' says Mr Bo Berggren, chief executive of Stora, Europe's largest paper group. Other costs are also under attack. In the UK, four plants have been closed and 1,200 jobs lost during the last 12 months, according to the UK-based Pulp and Paper Information Centre. Meanwhile, Scandinavian and north American groups have launched fierce cost-cutting exercises, including job losses, which Dutch and German companies have so far been unable to emulate. Dr Remrod, at the Swedish pulp and paper association, estimates that the Swedish industry has cut its workforce by 30 per cent - some 200,000 employees - in the past three years. Stora, Europe's largest paper group, has reduced the number of its employees from 45,000 to 39,000, and says more job losses are on the way. Mr Bernt Lof, chief executive of MoDo, the Swedish paper group, laments: 'We are closing mills that in three to five years time would be competitive.' However, it is far from clear whether such cost-cutting will be enough to let Nordic producers compete in the long-term with low-cost manufacturers in South America and Asia. Higher wages, transport and energy costs and the simple problem that trees in Scandinavian countries only grow 100 days a year, compared with 365 in Brazil, all work to the Scandinavians' disadvantage. The flight by European companies from pulp and commodity grades to added-value papers has not been altogether successful. The rush into a number of fast-growing niche markets, such as coated woodfree, has merely shifted overcapacity down the product chain. Shortage of cash has brought the heady acquisition activity of the late 1980s to an almost complete standstill. The only significant exceptions during the last 12 months included the DM400m (Pounds 166m) purchase in May of 90 per cent of Hannover Papier, one of Germany's leading producers of coated woodfree paper, by Sappi, the South African pulp and paper company. International Paper also acquired an 80 per cent stake in Kwidzyn Pulp and Paper Company, Poland's largest paper group, for Dollars 120m. In spite of the paucity of acquisition activity, a consolidation process is inevitable, according to Mr Sverker Martin-Lof, chief executive of SCA. He says weak balance sheets will force groups together to allow them to cut costs. The most likely route for the present is through mergers rather than acquisitions. 'Given the premium needed to purchase paper companies at the moment, it's nearly impossible to put together any acquisition of substantial size,' says Mr Michael Bottenheim, a managing director at Lazards, the merchant bankers. In Japan, Jujo Paper and Sanyo-Kokusaku Pulp, two leading Japanese paper producers led the way in July when they merged to create the country's largest papermaker. And last month the Dutch groups, KNP, VRG and Buhrmann-Tetterode, announced their intention to create Europe's second-largest paper and packaging group. Further mergers in Scandinavia are likely in the coming years. The main banking requirements will be for debt refinancing. Many companies need to refinance next year, but will have to renegotiate on the basis of poor 1992 results. Refunding will unhappily coincide with the bottom of the cycle. It is a brave bank at the moment that wants to increase its investment in the paper industry. Nordic groups are faced with the steepest refinancing challenge. Given the reluctance of international banks to finance paper groups, they would normally fall back on their domestic counterparts. But the Scandinavian banking system is in crisis. Many paper companies are now looking at project finance which can be carried off-balance sheet. An alternative would be to try to access other European equity markets, if only paper companies can convince investors of their longer-term prospects. The outlook for the industry is so uncertain that most groups have stopped offering prophesies. Most executives have been repeatedly guilty of wishful thinking. Mr Berggren, at Stora, says: 'We have been wrong so many times, we have given up trying to predict. But there are no signs of improvement.' Mr Martin-Lof, at SCA, believes this downturn is longer and deeper than others. The overcapacity, in some grades, could last until the late 1990s, he says. Nearly every paper company reckons it will become a money making machine - just as soon as the recovery comes. The problem is that nobody knows when the recovery will arrive.  --------------------------------------------------------- WEST EUROPEAN PRODUCTION OF PAPER AND BOARD: 1983-91  ---------------------------------------------------------                Total    Change        %              m tons*   m tons*   change  --------------------------------------------------------- 1983            44.2 1984            48.4       4.2      9.6 1985            48.6       0.2      0.5 1986            50.4       1.8      3.6 1987            53.3       2.9      5.7 1988            57.3       4.0      7.6 1989            59.4       2.1      3.6 1990            61.5       2.1      3.5 1991            62.1       0.6      0.9  --------------------------------------------------------- * Rounded figures  --------------------------------------------------------- Source: Cepi  ---------------------------------------------------------</p>

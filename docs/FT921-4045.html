			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (News): Business leaders see big reductions in costs - Northern Response NORTHERN business leaders last night forecast substantial reductions in costs, better cashflow and an easing of administrative burdens in the wake of the Budget. There was a wide welcome for the speeding of the transitional arrangements for the uniform business rate (UBR) in the north and Midlands. Sir Ian Wrigglesworth, northern region CBI vice-chairman, said news that the deferred reliefs are now to be activated would be welcomed by many northern companies. North-west business expects the overall gain from UBR changes eventually to be worth Pounds 310m over the 1990-94 period. Sheffield manufacturers expect a 40 per cent fall in business rates over the next two years. Mr Simon Sperryn, chief executive of the Manchester chamber, said that by protecting southern businesses while breaking the link with northern reductions, 'the Treasury will now pay for the change, as we have urged all along'. Mr John Hambidge, director of Sheffield Chamber of Commerce and Industry said: 'There appears to be a much greater incentive and ability to both listen and hear in an election year.' Mr Keith Robinson, director of Liverpool Chamber of Commerce, particularly welcomed help for the car industry because its membership includes Ford at Halewood, Vauxhall at Ellesmere Port and Delco Electronics, the General Motors component maker, at Kirkby. Like Mr Hambidge, he wanted car tax abolished. 'But half a loaf is better than none at all, and we'll settle for 5 per cent for now,' he added. In Leeds, Mr Peter Coles-Johnson, an economist who is secretary of the combined Yorkshire and Humberside chambers, said there would be widespread relief that Mr Lamont had not gone for 'a fiscal binge.' But he warned that ending the recession quickly depended on interest rate cuts. All the organisations said the introduction of one Budget statement on tax and spending a year would ease uncertainty in business planning. Mr Andrew Toop, of the north-west CBI regional council, said speeding payment of debts was also fair. 'It's a matter of everyone playing by the same rules,' he said. The change in inheritance tax is also going to have a widespread impact. 'About 80 per cent of members are small family businesses,' Mr Robinson added. Mr Harry Tuley, managing director of the Scapa textile engineering group and chairman of the north-west CBI regional council, regretted that more had not been done to stimulate investment in plant, machinery, education and training. He said Mr Lamont's prudence was welcome and small firms would find much encouragement. Personal tax changes would reassure consumers, whose lack of confidence had had so much impact on the High Street.</p>

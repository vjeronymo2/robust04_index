			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> EDBERG SUFFERS BRUISED KNEE, QUITS TOURNAMENT IN JAPAN  </P> <P> Stefan Edberg left England with his second Wimbledon singles title. Six days  later, he will leave Japan with a bruised left knee.  </P> <P> The Swede, who defeated Boris Becker last Sunday in the Wimbledon final,  retired from the Gunze World tournament Saturday after being injured when he  tripped over his racket.  </P> <P> While trying to return a shot of Jaime Yzaga of Peru, Edberg slipped and his  racket fell to the court. His foot apparently hit the racket and he fell to the  artificial surface.  </P> <P> "I don't remember exactly what happened," Edberg said.  </P> <P> Dr. Atsushi Iwamoto, who treated Edberg, said, "It was a bruise and not so  serious. I think he will be able to start practicing within two or three days."  </P> <P> The accident occurred during the first game of the second set after Edberg won  the first set, 6-2, at the Tokyo Metropolitan Gym.  </P> <P> In the other semifinal, Pete Sampras beat Jakob Hlasek of Switzerland, 6-2,  4-6, 6-2.  </P> <P> In the women's semifinals, top-seeded Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina defeated  Kimiko Date of Japan, 6-2, 4-6, 6-2, and Ann Grossman beat Rachel McQuillan of  Australia, 6-4, 7-6 (8-6).  </P> <P> Fourteen-year-old Jennifer Capriati moved to the brink of her first pro title,  defeating Susan Sloane, 6-2, 6-2, in the semifinals of the Mount Cranmore  International at Conway, N.H.  </P> <P> Capriati will make her third appearance in a final when she meets third-seeded  Ros Fairbank of Australia today. Fairbank upset No. 2 Laura Gildemeister, 7-6  (12-10), 6-2, in the other semifinal.  </P> <P> Sixth-seeded Darren Cahill of Australia beat No. 7 Eric Jelen of West Germany,  7-6 (7-4), 6-3, to reach the final of the Hall of Fame Championships at  Newport, R.I.  </P> <P> Cahill will face unseeded Pieter Aldrich of South Africa, who beat No. 4 Gary  Muller, 6-4, 7-6 (9-7).  </P></p>

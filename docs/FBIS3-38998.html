Brinkman, who heads the CDA  [Christian Democratic Appeal] list of candidates, feels that  illegal foreigners "must be rooted out." In order to prevent  illegals from entering the Netherlands, foreigners, as it were,  must be checked on the ramp to the airplane before it departs  for the Netherlands, Brinkman said.    According to Brinkman, a "precise" asylum policy is needed  in  order to prevent Netherlanders from blaming foreigners for all  their problems. If we are clear about who is rightly here,  Brinkman said, than nobody has the right to say "You don't  belong here."    The tone of Brinkman's speech elicited criticism from  coalition partner, the PvdA [Labor Party]. M. van Traa (of the  PvdA), a member of the Lower House, spoke of "a mistaken use of  words. You only use the term `root out' in connection with  weeds. On this subject matter, you must pay close attention to  your choice of words. Politicians have to understand that."  According to van Traa, illegality is not to be totally  discouraged, "unless you want to build a wall around the  country. You must therefore fight illegality where it causes  the most trouble, for instance within the context of  criminality." [passage omitted]</p>

The exchange was jointly built by the Shanghai Municipal  Committee of Agriculture, the Shanghai Municipal Committee for  Restructuring the Economy, the Shanghai Industrial and  Commercial Administration and the Shanghai Suburban Industrial  Bureau.    The exchange will adopt a membership system and, in the  early  period of operation, will focus on the transfer of  collectively-held property rights in the rural suburbs of  Shanghai, according to Zhang Yan, director of the management  committee of the exchange.    The director said that the exchange would select about 100  rural collectively-owned enterprises for trading this year.  More property rights brokerage companies will be set up to  conduct this aspect of business in Shanghai, one of China's  major financial centers.    The director added that the exchange would also be linked to  other property rights trading markets in the cities of Shenzhen,  Chengdu, Chongqing and Wuhan as early as possible.</p>

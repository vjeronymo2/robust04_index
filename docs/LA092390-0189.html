			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'HIPPER-THAN-THOU'  </P> <P> Lawrence S. Dietz's Aug. 19 review of John Gregory Dunne's "Crooning" reveals  more inadvertently about contemporary magazine writing than its author actually  says. From his 10-ton name-drop lead (". . . Tom Wolfe and I got to talking . .  .") to his oh-so-knowing asides about "a 1979 Lafite Rothschild" being "too  young to drink," Dietz airs only the views of the hipper-than-thou.  </P> <P> Who's in? Who's out? Or, "Who's hot -- Who's not?" as US likes to put it --  that's the preoccupation of most current magazine writers, and of most current  magazine publishers. Fame, L.A. Style, Vanity Fair, Entertainment -- what's all  this about? How long till somebody publishes Ego, the Journal of Contemporary  Self-Aggrandizement?  </P> <P> For their part, the writers for these magazines regularly sacrifice thought,  inspiration, instruction and enlightenment to a higher authority: the Bitchy  Quip. No matter how stylish, no matter how ephemerally entertaining, such a  writer ends up nothing but a quippy bitch.  </P> <P> And yes, Dietz is right. It's a terrible way to make a living.  </P> <P> LAWRENCE HENRY  </P> <P> BEVERLY HILLS  </P></p>

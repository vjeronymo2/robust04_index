			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / International Company News: Sogefi earnings little changed in first half SOGEFI, the Italian car parts group controlled by Mr Carlo De Benedetti's Cir holding company, resisted the European motor industry downturn with a only slight drop in consolidated first-half profits, to L19.4bn (Dollars 12.4m) before tax and extraordinary items against L19.6bn in 1992. Group sales rose to L328.6bn from L319.4bn, while net indebtedness declined to L104.2bn from L116.4bn at the end of June last year. Separately, Sasib, another big Cir-controlled engineering group, reported a fall in pre-tax first-half profits, to L21.9bn against L23.4bn last time. Sasib said the tax figures masked an improvement in its trading position, as the decline was mainly due to lower dividends and tax credits. Operating profits recovered to L5.4bn from L600m last year. The group forecast that full-year figures should represent an improvement on 1992. Inflated by the lower value of the lira, turnover at the railway signalling, tobacco equipment and food processing machinery maker jumped 17.5 per cent to L379.2bn. Gemina, the investment and financial services group tipped as one of the most likely buyers of state assets in Italy's privatisation process, yesterday admitted it had about L600bn in its war chest for possible acquisitions. Gemina, in which the Fiat industrial group is the dominant shareholder, has been building up liquidity through a number of disposals or flotations. The group reported a 23.4 per cent rise in consolidated net profits to L193.7bn for the financial year to June 30. Although net earnings by the parent company jumped to L125.3bn from L42.7bn, the dividend remains unchanged at L60 for ordinary shares and L70 for savings stock.</p>

			<p>940316 FT  16 MAR 94 / Best-selling trust to suffer yield cut A group offering a 10 per cent return on its best-selling trust has warned 70,000 investors that it will cut the yield to 9 per cent from June 28. The high-income unit trust offered by fund manager Foreign &amp; Colonial has pulled in more than Pounds 500m since its launch just over a year ago. It was particularly attractive to income seekers and heavily promoted by many financial intermediaries because of the 10 per cent yield. Such funds, which obtain an unusually high income, have been highly controversial because they can procure such high returns only at the expense of the capital growth prospects. Many experts believe savers' capital could actually be eroded in order to keep the income flowing. Over the past year, anyone investing in the F&amp;C fund would have lost roughly 10 per cent of their initial investment - neatly cancelling out the benefit of the 10 per cent income. Most conventional equity income funds have produced a significantly better return. Mr Simon James, F&amp;C director, said the decision to cut the target yield on the fund was mainly because the group expects interest rates to move lower this year. He added that the group also wants to give investors plenty of notice of the impending cut in yield. F&amp;C has also trimmed its management charge from 1.5 per cent to 1.25 per cent with effect from April 6.</p>

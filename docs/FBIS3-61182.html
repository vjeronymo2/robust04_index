			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Texts of Liberal Democratic Party of Russia "Program" and </F> "Charter," received by FBIS 23 December 1993]    [Text]  <H5>  PROGRAM OF THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF RUSSIA </H5> <H5>  I. GENERAL PROVISIONS </H5>   The purpose of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR]  is to create in the country conditions for the unfettered  practical expression of the creative abilities of the people  populating the country and assiduous use of our country's  natural resources.    The LDPR program is a program of our society's development  in  accordance with its needs without any outside interference.    A member of the LDPR is a person who does not separate his  personal interests from those of the motherland;    --he is a creator, making a contribution to fulfillment of  the motherland's priority goals, which are aimed at preserving  peace and raising the living standard of the entire population  of our vast country.    The LDPR's political activity is aimed at restoring by  peaceful means and preserving the Russian state built over  centuries; restoring and protecting the country's borders;  ensuring inside the country peaceful cohabitation of all the  peoples populating it--large and small--with the right to  preserve traditions and customs, develop national culture, and  exercise freedom of conscience. Russia is a motherland without  any kind of discrimination.  <H5>  II. DOMESTIC POLICY </H5>   Domestic policy is implemented by the executive branch,  headed by the president, on the basis of observing the law and  freedom of entrepreneurial activities.    Strict observance of the law is the main guarantee of  establishing and maintaining order, an immutable condition for  building and functioning of a law-based state.    The internal system is based on the  administrative-territorial principle: the basic unit is the  province (oblast). There shall be no national state entities on  the territory of Russia.    Legislation is enacted by the Parliament (State Duma),  formed  by holding elections on the territorial principle. The  parliament adopts laws, adopts a Constitution, and amends it if  necessary.    The entirety of executive power is vested in the head of  state--the president, elected by citizens eligible to vote,  through a secret ballot. The president appoints the prime  minister, who forms the cabinet of ministers, which is approved  by the president. The president has the right to disband the  parliament, call for new elections, and veto laws. The president  is answerable to the parliament in the event he commits  anticonstitutional actions.    The judiciary is independent from the legislative and  executive branches. All citizens are equal before law and enjoy  equal rights.  <H5>  III. THE ECONOMY </H5>   The goal of the LDPR's economic policy is to create a life  of  dignity and well-being for every inhabitant of  Russia--gradually, without "revolutionary leaps" or cataclysms.  This is impossible to accomplish by "decrees from the top": This  task can only be accomplished by uniting society and providing  everyone the opportunity to work in peace and creatively, to  support themselves and their family, while enjoying life.    Only a central power, and only with active and concerted  help  from the regions, can put in motion the production flywheels of  such an immense country as Russia. Russia possesses the  necessary resources--raw material, land, industrial, and human,  including intellectual--to enable it to develop its own economy  fast, without any prompting or enslaving credits from "outside."    It is necessary to ensure for everyone the opportunity to  participate in production. Unprofitable enterprises and those  producing output that is not in demand should be retargeted and  provided with resources to produce goods in short supply and  spare parts for our equipment. The population should not  experience unemployment or live in fear of it.    Wages should be no lower than the sustenance minimum. Highly  skilled specialists should get higher wages that correspond to  the complexity, difficulty, and quality of their labor.    At the initial stage, privatization should only extend to  small enterprises and the service sphere. Enterprises that are  being privatized cannot be sold to outsiders--they must be  transferred to the ownership of the collective. Only at a later  stage should it be permitted to sell them on the open market.    Housing should be transferred free of charge to the  ownership  of the people living in it. Those on the waiting lists should be  given an opportunity to purchase housing on credit with  subsequent repayment of its cost to the state over 25-50 years,  interest-free, beginning with the fourth year of occupancy.    At the initial stage, land remains the property of the  state.  Those wishing to do so may have land on a long-term lease (25-50  years) without prepayment, with right to inherit, but with the  mandatory condition that the land will lie fallow, and that the  lessor with work it and produce agricultural output.    Profitable kolkhozes and sovkhozes are equated in their  land-use rights to private lessors. All unused land should be  returned to the state.    All kinds of speculative reselling must be stopped.    Well-organized production and uninterrupted material supply  of industrial enterprises in the state sector with the resources  necessary for production will allow for uninterrupted and  profitable work. At the same time, state enterprises' output  will be sold at fixed prices. Key economic sectors in industry,  agriculture, and science needed to raise the level of production  and quality of goods in other production sectors will be  provided targeted financing out of tax revenue.    Providing agriculture with the needed equipment supplied by  state enterprises, as well as fuel and power resources, state  assistance in setting up local food-processing industry, and  preferential rates for transportation of agricultural output  will enable the products produced by the arduous effort of the  rural population to be fully utilized.    Export of surplus resources with state assistance and under  state control will increase the inflow of hard currency into the  country.</p>

			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rain hampers US plantings INCESSANT SPRING rains have hampered plantings across the US maize and soyabean belt and cool weather has put US winter wheat development as much as two weeks behind schedule. Crop-watchers are fretting that final maize plantings will be abandoned if the wet weather continues - and it appears that it will. The National Weather Service forecast on Monday above-normal precipitation across the US heartland for the next 10 days. Late plantings and cool, moist weather that encourages crop diseases like mildew and fungus should add up to a weather rally in the grain futures pits at the Chicago Board of Trade. Instead, maize and wheat prices in Chicago are in the midst of seasonal declines, and soyabean prices are moving sideways. The reason? Around the world cereals crops appear to be in generally good condition and demand for the US wheat crop is weak, with buyers sniffing at export incentives and biding their time until the harvest pushes prices lower. 'Everybody seems to have good crop prospects - the UK, EC, Canada,' says Mr. Daniel Basse, analyst for the consulting firm Ag Resources. He said development progress of spring crops and quality levels of US winter wheat won't be obvious until July. The US Department of Agriculture reported on Monday that US soyabean plantings were 59 per cent complete last week, compared with a 5-year average of 75 per cent. Maize plantings were only 93 per cent of the forecast 76.5m acres, about 6 percentage points behind the average. 'It does raise concerns that not all of those acres will be planted and that the late plantings will result in lower yields,' says Mr Dale Gustafson, senior grains analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham in Chicago. He adds, however, that history gives little indication of the crop outcome. Of the five late-planted crops since 1981, about half yielded above-normal and half below.</p>

			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Swedish sell-offs to slow down Sweden's new Social Democrat industry minister, Mr Sten Heckscher, has said two existing privatisation plans would continue but that he was less enthusiastic about state asset sales than his conservative predecessor. 'Privatisation is not a religion for us,' he said in a weekend interview with the business daily, Dagens Industri. The planned flotation of the bank, Nordbanken, and the sale of more shares in the drugs maker, Pharmacia, would continue. However, in Nordbanken's case, Mr Heckscher said there would be no hurry to comply with the target of early 1995 set by the previous minister, Mr Per Westerberg. Mr Heckscher said that he would consider some privatisation of the national telecommunications company, Telia, 'but I am convinced that the state must ensure it has a significant control over this company in the foreseeable future'.</p>

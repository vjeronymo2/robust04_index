			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / International Company News: Marriott earnings static at Dollars 85m MARRIOTT the US hotel and food services group which has faced bondholder anger over a plan to split its management operations and property assets into two separately-quoted entities, yesterday reported static profits for 1992. The company earned Dollars 85m after tax during the 12-month period, against Dollars 82m in 1991, after a slip to Dollars 19m from Dollars 27m in the fourth quarter. Revenues for the year were Dollars 8.72bn, compared with Dollars 8.33bn while fourth-quarter sales totalled Dollars 2.78bn against Dollars 2.73bn. The full-year and final-quarter figures for 1992 were struck after a Dollars 21m pre-tax charge covering 'transaction costs associated with the plan to divide Marriott into two separate companies'. Comparisons were muddied by property sales and other factors. It claimed underlying operating had increased by 11 per cent. On the lodging side, Marriott said the underlying operating profit advance was 14 per cent.

			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DITCH DAY A DELIGHT, NOT A TRANSGRESSION  </P> <P> Re "Let's Get Lost" (June 13): As a great-grandmother, I am far removed from  the school scene and not aware of what today's high school students are up to  other than the really grim things that make headlines.  </P> <P> I was actually delighted to know ditch days still happen.  </P> <P> Traditions are good; they give us continuity and meaning. To me, ditch day was  a memorable, innocent adventure. It took great courage, which I seldom had,  just to tell my parents what I was doing. I did tell them, and I had no written  excuse in which my parents would have had to lie. I faced the girls' vice  principal on Monday morning, and whatever punishment I received, I felt was  justified.  </P> <P> I faced the same situation with my son at Hollywood High, only they would not  allow him back in school until I saw the principal. I explained to him that my  son had ditched with my permission as a tradition, and I had refused to write a  phony excuse. I was told they were preparing to withhold his diploma. We went  to his graduation not knowing whether he would receive his diploma. He did.  </P> <P> DOROTHY STEVEN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

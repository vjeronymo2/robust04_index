			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CAMP COUNSELOR, 19, PLEADS NO CONTEST TO MOLESTATION  </P> <P> A 19-year-old former camp counselor pleaded no contest Friday to charges that  he molested three teen-agers at a Castaic camp for deaf children two weeks ago.  </P> <P> Martin Luther Willis faced one count each of sodomy, sexual battery and child  molestation and was being held in lieu of $75,000 bail.  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies arrested Willis Aug. 10 at the Lion's of California/Nevada  Wilderness Camp for Deaf Children held at 38001 Golden State Highway. Deputies  were called to the camp after a camp official learned of the alleged  molestations from a teen-ager there, Sgt. Joaquin Herran said.  </P> <P> The alleged incidents involved two 16-year-olds and a 13-year-old.  </P> <P> Authorities said Willis, who is also deaf, had been a counselor there for two  weeks. Two of his victims were deaf and attending the camp when the alleged  molestations occurred, and another was visiting her brother.  </P> <P> Had the case gone to trial, Willis would have faced nine years in state prison.  Because of his early plea, he will probably receive one year in prison and five  years of probation, Deputy Dist. Atty. Pamela Davis-Springer said.  </P> <P> Prosecutors agreed to the arrangement because of Willis' age and to keep the  victims from having to testify.  </P> <P> "Sparing the victims the trauma of testifying, early admission of his guilt and  his age all entered in the decision" to allow the plea, Davis-Springer said.  </P> <P> Willis will be sentenced in September.  </P></p>

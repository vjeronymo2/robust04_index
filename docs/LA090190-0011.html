			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MELVIN DURSLAG: THEY HAVE FANS UNDER THE GUN  </P> <P> Those who follow the adventures of Nolan Ryan these days appear to be puzzled  by the speed of his fastball.  </P> <P> Nor is the onfusion eased by television, which enlists the help of the radar  gun to measure the velocity of Nolan's hummers, now dispensed by an arm that is  43.  </P> <P> An arm that is 43 is not to be dismantled and sold for parts. But it isn't  supposed to cause trouble, either, getting folks quarreling over whether the  pitches it turns loose are traveling 90, 93, 95 or even 100 m.p.h.  </P> <P> Society would be relieved of a major burden today if speed guns had not been  invented. Jim Palmer, your friendly neighborhood Hall of Famer, never has  trusted the gun, pointing out that Pennsylvania highway police using the  instrument one day got no reading on a motorist but clocked a tree going 85.  </P> <P> Then a discrepancy exists between the two principal speed guns employed in  baseball, one brand measuring pitches at roughly 4 m.p.h. faster than the  other.  </P> <P> And some scouts will submit that low pitches register faster on the gun than  high pitches.  </P> <P> Nolan Ryan wishes that arguments over the speed of his pitches would desist.  </P> <P> "It doesn't mean anything, because how fast you throw the ball isn't as  important as where you throw it," he explains.  </P> <P> Statistics show, besides, that Ryan today is throwing only 60% fastballs. He  goes to the curve 25% of the time and to the changeup 15%.  </P> <P> If Ryan never took speed guns seriously as a rosy-jawed lad, he isn't taking  them seriously at 43. With a knowing smile, he has allowed a promotional circus  to be built around his speed for years.  </P> <P> Back in 1974, when Ryan served the Angels, a marketing genius came up with the  idea of offering a trip to Hawaii to the fan coming closest to predicting how  fast he would throw the ball in a game at Anaheim Stadium.  </P> <P> To give substance to this cerebral explosion, the Angels invited a team of four  scientists from Rockwell International to deploy a new infrared radar device  used previously for determining the speed of missiles.  </P> <P> Setting up this instrument, the scientists went to work. They clocked Ryan's  fastball at 100.9 m.p.h. -- and it was aloha for a customer hitting that figure  on the button.  </P> <P> It was explained that the same equipment could measure the speed of a  baserunner, but, blessedly, it hasn't been called upon for that purpose.  </P> <P> Otherwise, you might be hearing on TV, "On that last steal, Vince Coleman  reached a maximum speed of 28 m.p.h."  </P> <P> Do speed guns serve any useful purpose, or, producing more numbers, do they  clutter further the minds of viewers?  </P> <P> "The guns are probably most useful in the scouting of young talent," says Ben  Wade, director of scouting for the Dodgers. "Speed is the basic item for  beginning your assessment. You put a gun on a kid. If it it measures, say, 90,  you know this is someone worth your attention.  </P> <P> "But clocking speed also is dangerous because, finding someone who lacks it,  you could walk away from a good pitcher. We have a fine prospect named Jim  Neidlinger. He throws only 85. But he has finesse, which is just as important  as speed."  </P> <P> Once a giant of the bullpen, a big velocity man, Goose Gossage contended that  speed guns made his job easier.  </P> <P> "Batters hear about these gun ratings," Gossage said. "They psych out. They  grow tense at the plate, worried whether they will be able to get around on the  pitch. If I were a hitter, I would step into the box pretending no one throws  faster than 82."  </P> <P> The problem of the batter increases when word reaches him that the pitcher's  fastball rises, as it is supposed to do for such as Ryan, Roger Clemens and Rob  Dibble.  </P> <P> Many scholars will debate you on the issue of the rising fastball, claiming  that it is an optical illusion. The eye is so trained to seeing pitches that  drop that when they maintain their plane, they give the impression of rising,  goes that argument.  </P> <P> It reminds you of the testimony offered by Yogi Berra on a tape-measure homer  by Mickey Mantle.  </P> <P> "When that ball hit the third tier 400 feet away, it was still rising!" Yogi  exclaimed.  </P> <P> Well, an object following a reasonably parabolic course must travel as great a  distance on the fall as it does on the rise, meaning that Mantle, to Berra's  discerning eye, had an 800-foot jewel in the works.  </P></p>

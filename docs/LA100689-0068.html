			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH HAILS GERMAN EXODUS BUT BERLIN EMBASSY IS PUT 'OFF LIMITS'  </P> <P> Although President Bush declared Thursday that he is deeply moved by the flight  of East Germans to the West and that "America stands with the forces of  change," the State Department announced that the U.S. Embassy in East Berlin  will not become a haven for refugees.  </P> <P> The Administration, which was drawn into the escalating drama when 18 East  Germans pushed their way into the embassy earlier this week, negotiated an  accommodation with the Communist government effectively closing the embassy to  future refugees while allowing the 18 to leave the country.  </P> <P> "The embassy that we have in Berlin is, of course, not set up as a place where  people can go," said State Department spokesman Richard Boucher. "Our embassies  and other diplomatic missions overseas generally do not have the capability to  handle even a limited number of people who would seek to depart their home  country, especially people who have to seek to depart their home country by  sitting in at a foreign embassy."  </P> <P> He said that the embassy "remains open for people with normal embassy  business," which clearly excludes desperate people trying to flee East Germany.  </P> <P> Despite decades of impassioned rhetoric in support of free emigration, the U.S.  government is reluctant to play an active role in the frenzied scramble by East  Germans to reach West Germany because it is concerned that forceful involvement  might upset U.S.-Soviet relations or trigger a harsh crackdown.  </P> <P> Bush illustrated the paradox in his remarks to a Rose Garden audience that  included several members of the Bundestag, the lower house of the West German  Parliament.  </P> <P> "We are riveted, and I am moved, by the tens of thousands of East Germans  sacrificing all that they own, leaving everything behind, to find their way to  a West that offers the promise of freedom and opportunity," Bush said.  </P> <P> "I also look forward to the day that Germans will not have to climb fences,  freeze in embassy courtyards or dodge bullets in order to enjoy the fruits of a  free society," the President said as he signed a German-American day  proclamation.  </P> <P> But East Germany has responded to the flight of its citizens not by relaxing  controls, as Bush urged, but by imposing new restrictions on travel to  Czechoslovakia, one of the main routes that East Germans have taken to the  West.  </P> <P> With the new travel ban, which echoes earlier restrictions on travel to Hungary  and Poland, the only way out of East Germany may prove to be over the fence  surrounding one of the Western embassies in the East German capital. And that  may drag the Administration back into the crisis, despite its best efforts to  remain aloof.  </P> <P> "If these travel restrictions are going to be enforced and if there isn't any  give in the East German regime, the situation will become more and more  explosive," said Helmut Sonnenfeldt, a former State Department and National  Security Council expert on Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> "This virus is infecting the entire population," he said. "It presents the  nightmare scenario on how things might really become unglued in central  Europe."  </P> <P> Sonnenfeldt said that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev "has his work cut  out for him" to persuade the East Germans to ease the travel restrictions.  </P> <P> "We and the British and the French (embassies) will confront this more and  more," he said. "We have limited space, so we have to hope that we will not be  faced with thousands of people."  </P> <P> If there is a sudden rush of refugees to Western embassies, East German police  almost certainly would try to prevent them from reaching the buildings. The  police did just that Wednesday when hundreds of East Germans attempted to  follow the 18 asylum-seekers into the U.S. Embassy.  </P> <P> Boucher said the U.S. government objected to the police action and "sought  assurances that visitors with normal embassy business will not be stopped."  </P> <P> The State Department spokesman made it clear that the U.S. government does not  consider attempts to obtain asylum to be "normal embassy business." But, he  added, "We deplore the manhandling of the crowd by the East German police."  </P> <P> Unlike Poland, Hungary or even the Soviet Union, the East German government may  be unable to relax its iron grip much. Communist ideology is the major thing  that differentiates East Germany from its larger and richer neighbor, West  Germany. But the regime seems to be finding it more difficult every year to  maintain its ideological edge.  </P> <P> "There used to be some significant support for all of those Eastern European  regimes," said Charles William Maynes, editor of Foreign Policy magazine. "Now  I don't think there is any. The prewar regimes had been so bankrupt and had led  the countries into such disasters that there was a willingness on the part of a  significant portion of the population to acquiesce in the new system. I think  that has all been burned out. There is no starch to the regime. There is nobody  at the middle levels who believes."  </P> <P> Maynes said that the East German regime has "only two choices -- put a wall  along every border or establish an orderly procedure for emigration."  </P> <P> But Robert Hunter, director of European Studies at the Center for Strategic and  International Studies in Washington, said: "It is hard to believe that East  Germany will permit itself to be bled to death, as much as we might like to see  it. We are not dealing with a bunch of pussycats. We are dealing with people  who are heavily armed and strongly motivated to prevent the destruction of  their society."  </P> <P> Times staff writer James Gerstenzang contributed to this report.  </P></p>

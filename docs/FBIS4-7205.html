			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 25 KYODO -- Health and Welfare  Minister Keigo Ouchi is expected to continue pushing for a  thorough reform of the social security system to cope with  Japan's aging society.    The 64-year-old chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party  (DSP) shared former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's vision of  a welfare society. However, he was strongly opposed to  Hosokawa's surprise proposal in February to introduce a "7  percent national welfare tax" on grounds the coalition parties  were not consulted first.    The tax plan designed to partly finance tax cuts was  scrapped  the day after Hosokawa announced it.    Ouchi once called for a tie-up with Hosokawa's Japan New  Party and new party Sakigake (Harbinger). He also said he  favors a multiparty system but less than the current number,  along with the coalition's leading Social Democratic Party (SDP)  [of Japan -- SDPJ] and new party Sakigake, while Shinseito  (Japan Renewal Party) and Komeito [Clean Government Party], the  alliance's two core blocs, are urging coalition partners to  consolidate into one party to fight the main opposition Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP).    Ouchi, however, joined a new parliamentary group called  "Kaishin" (Innovation), which was formed at his suggestion hours  after Tsutomu Hata was elected new prime minister. The group  comprises members of Shinseito, the Japan New Party of Hosokawa,  the DSP, the newly established "Jiyuto" (Liberal Party) and  Kaikaku-no-kai.    Together with other right-wing members who quit the former  Socialist Party to found the DSP in 1960, Ouchi is known as a  formulator of centrist policies.    In 1976, he was elected to the House of Representatives for  the first time from a Tokyo constituency. After serving four  consecutive terms in the lower house, he lost his seat in the  1986 election, despite holding the DSP's No. 2 position of  secretary general.    He recaptured his seat in the lower house and took office as  chairman of the DSP. In last year's general election, he was  elected for the sixth time.</p>

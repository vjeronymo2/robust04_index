			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BROTHERS MENENDEZ  </P> <P> In 1985, an 18-year-old Calabasas High School student, from a prominent  Calabasas family, gunned down a schoolmate during a brief, uncharacteristic and  emotionally difficult time in both young men's lives. Both of these  high-society kids met with circumstances they were unable to deal with -- and  both resorted to violence.  </P> <P> The final outcome was a tragedy for all involved. The Times reported the story  as in unfolded with many front-page and front Metro page stories. The Times  kept an unbiased viewpoint and simply reported. That 18-year-old was me, and I  have now been in prison for over five years, serving a 17-years-to-life  sentence.  </P> <P> Now, in 1990, two high-society kids, also from Calabasas of late, have been  charged with the murder of their parents. However, the differences in the  reporting styles now and then are immense. It is appalling that The Times has  decided to become judge, jury and executioner for these two young men.  Reporters Johnson and Soble have unequivocally pronounced these two young men  guilty as charged. The reporting style fails entirely in any attempt to  maintain objectivity and has, in fact, taken on the clear tone of a  prosecutor's closing arguments -- inherently biased monologues which often  stray wildly from fact.  </P> <P> In the interest of justice, I urge you to reconsider your reporting tactics in  this case and to report the facts as fact and speculation as speculation, but  keep in mind the difference.  </P> <P> ROBERT M. ROSENKRANTZ  </P> <P> San Luis Obispo  </P></p>

			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / More secure on Wall Street: Five years after the crash, the US securities industry is less vulnerable A short, crisp memo, containing good news and a warning, will be delivered over the next few weeks to every staff member of Goldman Sachs, one of the largest and most successful New York investment banks. The good news will be the size of employees' annual bonuses, which should be particularly generous since Wall Street is nearing the end of its most profitable year ever. But Goldman's management is also expected to caution staff against making extravagant changes in lifestyle, pointing out that fat years on Wall Street eventually give way to lean. The warning is especially timely, just after the fifth anniversary of the stock market crash of October 1987. For while the US securities industry is flying high now it faces three unsettling questions: First, how long can the current strength of profits last? Second, to what extent has the industry protected itself against cyclical downturns through a series of management initiatives taken since 1987? And third, which securities firms will be squeezed hardest over the next decade by intensifying competition, coming from three directions: the increasingly global character of the securities industry; the growing importance of technology; and the encroachment on the domestic securities industry by US banks, notably blue-chip J P Morgan? Certainly, the best US securities firms seem better placed to withstand any impending difficulties than they were in the bullish 1980s, which ended in a succession of traumatic shocks that changed the face of Wall Street. The 1987 crash scared individual investors away and forced the retail brokerage firms serving this market to cut operations. Then the collapse of the junk bond market in 1990 brought an end to the takeover boom, destroyed the upstart investment bank of Drexel Burnham Lambert, and left several other large firms - notably First Boston and Shearson Lehman - in financial crisis. These events, combined with the complexity of a business growing increasingly global and reliant on computer technology, have forced Wall Street firms to adopt a more professional approach to management. 'Managements didn't get religious about planning until after the '87 crash and they then became obsessed with it during and after 1990,' says Mr Michael Flanagan of consultancy Lipper Analytical. The elements include: More formal management structures, imposing better checks and balances on policy decisions, often coupled with devolution of responsibility down the line to executives. Probably the last big firm to undergo such a change was Salomon Bros, where the new executive team installed after last year's Treasury bond trading scandal has updated the company's outdated management system. Better management reporting and cost controls. Mr Herbert Allison, executive vice-president for finance at Merrill Lynch, the securities house, notes that in 1985 the firm 'could produce only one bottom line for 90 per cent of our business. We had no way to determine where we were earning or losing money. Now we have 3,000 bottom lines and can quickly spot variance from budget and take action.' Staff constitutes the largest element of Wall Street's costs - about 75 per cent in many cases - and the industry's headcount has dropped sharply over the past five years, from a peak of slightly more than 262,000 to just below 224,000. Salaries remain high by the standards of other industries, but are now more closely related to an individual's performance. Many of the job cuts have been in support staff, increasing the ratio of revenue producers to non-producers. All this has been accompanied by a rise in the status of managers handling budgets, expenses and computer technology - traditionally referred to rather contemptuously as back-office staff. Goldman Sachs, for example, recently moved three partners from its investment banking operations to add clout to the firm's financial administration. Mr Stephen Friedman, co-chairman, explains: 'We said to ourselves: 'We are a complex multinational business like many of our clients. Should we not give ourselves the kind of resources we would employ for them?'' Better management of balance sheets and an improvement in asset quality. Wall Street learned a harsh lesson about liquidity when crises at Drexel, First Boston and Shearson left the firms short of new capital, and in some cases dissuaded their regular lenders from rolling over short-term borrowings. This would not have been a problem if assets could have been sold quickly. But the three had trouble either raising new capital or liquidating their inventories, packed with high-yielding but difficult-to-sell securities such as junk bonds. In the end, First Boston had to be rescued by its largest shareholder, Credit Suisse, and Shearson by its parent, American Express. Drexel, lacking a deep-pocketed associate, went into bankruptcy. Fearful of similar problems, other securities houses fortified their balance sheets with more equity capital, and with higher-quality, easily disposable assets - such as government bonds, municipal bonds and mortgage-backed securities. The importance of better liquidity was underlined last year when Salomon Bros became embroiled in financial scandal. Over a period of just three weeks it raised about Dollars 50bn to pay lenders who had refused to extend short-term loans. The rush to improve asset quality, however, has a downside. The returns from trading higher quality assets such as government bonds are smaller than those from higher yielding securities. Because of this securities companies have 'leveraged up' - increased borrowings against their equity - in an effort to maintain their return on assets. That said, firms are also devoting greater resources, including computer programs, to analysis and control of the financial dangers, whether of poor credit risks or the trading of complex derivative products such as swaps and options. Yet, however elaborate these precautions, human fallibility will always leave traders open to large losses, and US regulators fear that the risks inherent in complex derivative products are not fully appreciated. 'If we get a sudden market drop there are going to be some big institutions which don't understand their exposure,' warns one prominent Wall Street executive. In addition to management changes the US securities industry has also adopted new strategies, for example, the diversification of business. The securities industry has always been cyclical, with revenues tied closely to factors it cannot control such as stock prices, interest rates and investor demand. In response, Wall Street has been seeking to move away from volatile trading-related businesses and into fields where revenues are relatively stable, and preferably fee-based. A good example is asset management, where Merrill Lynch has been particularly successful. By the end of last year it was managing Dollars 345bn of client funds, making it the largest custodian of individual assets in the US. One of the firm's goals is to cover fully its fixed costs with 'stable revenues' (such as asset management) by the year 2000, 'so that we'll be assured of profitability in almost any environment', according to Mr Allison. Even at the most diversified firms, however, asset management still accounted for not much more than 10 per cent of non-interest revenues last year, and securities houses remain highly dependent on traditional sources of income - investment banking (advising firms on takeovers and underwriting issues of securities); using the firm's own money to trade securities and foreign exchange; and taking commission from clients for buying and selling securities on their behalf. The various management and strategy changes have strengthened the industry. This is perhaps just as well, for after two years in which a buoyant stock market, falling interest rates and low inflation have ensured strong profits, the outlook may be turning harsher. Stock market activity has slowed, demand for equity and bond underwriting services appears to have peaked and interest rates may start climbing again next year. This comes, moreover, as the industry is facing increasing competition from many directions. The Glass-Steagal Act, which has divided commercial banking and the securities industry since the early 1930s, is still in place, but is becoming fuzzier and may be swept away before the decade is out. In the retail field, the large, established brokers are facing pressure from cut-rate houses such as Charles Schwab, from mutual fund managers and from commercial banks. For example, Nationsbank, one of the country's largest regional banks, this week announced a joint venture with brokerage Dean Witter to offer securities at its branches. In the wholesale field - providing services to large institutions and corporations - the main challenge comes from a handful of well-capitalised banks which has been given permission by the Federal Reserve to underwrite issues of securities. None is more threatening than J P Morgan. Its new securities arm has already leapt from nowhere to number seven in the list of corporate bond underwriters over the past few years. What remains unclear is whether the inroads of J P Morgan and other banks will inflict most damage on the top half dozen Wall Street houses  - the integrated firms with a wide range of services and big international operations - or the middle-rankers just beneath them. Certainly, the middle-rankers are likely to suffer from lack of financial and human resources in an industry which is becoming increasingly globalised and more and more reliant on expensive computer capital equipment. By contrast, the handful of top US investment banks that has already established strong global operations - notably Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch and First Boston - are significantly more powerful international players than their would-be European and Japanese competitors. In some cases their international operations are growing much faster than their American business. Mr Richard Fisher, chairman of Morgan Stanley, predicts that one of the firm's top five officials will need to be located outside the US before too long. He also argues that, since securities markets are by nature volatile, there is limited value in trying to predict which products are going to sell best. 'The important thing is to be able to respond to market changes and move people quickly. That is one of the keys to managing a global investment bank.'  ---------------------------------------------------------------- THE ROAD TO HIGHER PROFITS  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Broker rankings  ----------------------------------------------------------------                       Revenue           Net income                    1991     1996     1991      1996                   Dollars billion    Dollars million  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Merrill Lynch      7.26     6.91      696       454 Shearson Lehman    5.43     4.40      207        93 Salomon            3.54     2.30      507       516 PaineWebber        2.11     1.66      151        72 Bear Stearns*      1.24     1.22      143       173 Morgan Stanley     2.86     1.43      475       201 A G Edwards**      0.85     0.52       92        54 Charles Schwab     0.57     0.24       50        32 Smith Barney+      1.34     0.88      152        61  ---------------------------------------------------------------- * Year end Jun 30, 1990 and Apr 30, 1987 ** 12 months to Nov 30, 1991 and Feb 28, 1987 + Year ended Mar 1987  ----------------------------------------------------------------  ---------------------------------------------------------------- TOP 10 US UNDERWRITERS  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Investment-grade debt*  ----------------------------------------------------------------                        Amount                   Issues                     1991    1990      1991    1990   (1990 rank)                   Dollars billion  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Merrill Lynch      48.59   29.18       327     242       (1) Goldman, Sachs     40.10   16.78       351     107       (3) Lehman Brothers    30.67    7.11       361      48       (6) Morgan Stanley     23.62   22.88       165     152       (2) First Boston       20.99    9.57       193      65       (5) Salomon            15.50   13.67        86      67       (4) Kidder Peabody      5.66    2.40        90      16       (7) J P Morgan          4.75    0.44        75       4      (13) Bear Stearns        1.98    1.86        16      16       (8) PaineWebber         1.87    1.05        11      15       (9)  ---------------------------------------------------------------- * Excludes mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, convertible bonds and junk bonds  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Sources: Keefe Worldwide Information Services, IDD Information Services  ----------------------------------------------------------------</p>

Kozyrev and Karadzic told reporters that Russian "observers"  would be deployed at the airport to guarantee it was used for  delivery of aid including a Russian humanitarian aid shipment to  be flown there soon.    "Russian observers... will guarantee control under UNPROFOR  and make sure the airport is used for humanitarian and not  military deliveries," Kozyrev told reporters following two hours  of talks with the Bosnian Serb leader.    UNPROFOR is the United Nations Protection Force.    Karadzic said his meeting with Kozyrev was "not easy" and  the  Russian minister described the talks as "difficult."    Neither gave a date for the opening of the airport at Tuzla,  but Kozyrev said a shipment of humanitarian aid from Russia  would be flown into the airport "soon."    The city, including the airport, is surrounded by Bosnian  Serb forces.    The airport has been closed for more than a year and  pressure  for it to be opened was stepped up at the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization (NATO) summit in January when Britain and France  called for its reopening.    Meanwhile UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's special  envoy in the former Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi, visited Tuzla  airport early Tuesday, his spokesman said in Zagreb.    It was Akashi's first visit to Tuzla, where he arrived from  the Croatian port of Split early Tuesday.    Spokesman Michael Williams said, "He'll be looking at the  situation with regard to the airport and it remains our strong  hope that the airport can be opened soon for humanitarian  purposes."    "He has made a tour of the airfield this morning, and this  afternoon he'll be meeting with local and regional authorities,"  Williams said.    "At the end of the afternoon he'll be visiting a refugee  center in Tuzla."    Williams said that in Tuzla itself the situation remained  relatively calm.    A total of 14 shells hit the airfield Monday, of which about  half fell close to the main building.</p>

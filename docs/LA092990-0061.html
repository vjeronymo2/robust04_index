			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> NONLEAGUE  </P> <P> Harvard 34, La Canada 28 -- After losing fumbles on three of its first four  possessions, Harvard (3-1) jumped to a 21-0 halftime lead and then barely held  on at home.  </P> <P> Harvard running back Kent Dahn carried eight times for 85 yards and scored on  runs of three, one and 80 yards.  </P> <P> Quarterback Steve Kezirian, who sat out the second half, completed four of  eight for 109 yards and a touchdown.  </P> <P> La Canada (2-2) scored four times in the final 11 minutes against Harvard  reserves. Quarterback Chris Plamann completed 15 of 28 for 257 yards and two  touchdowns. Running back Jeff Park rushed for 88 yards and a touchdown.  </P> <P> Plamann threw a 26-yard scoring pass to Chris Ray with 22 seconds left, but La  Canada was unable to recover an onside kick and Harvard ran out the clock.  </P> <P> Harvard and La Canada combined for seven first-half turnovers, including three  turnovers on consecutive plays in the first quarter.  </P> <P> "It wasn't because either team was hitting hard," Harvard Coach Gary Thran  said. "Both teams were tentative at the start. That's why there were so many  fumbles."  </P> <P> Harvard began its scoring on Dahn's three-yard run, one play after Park fumbled  a handoff.  </P> <P> Kezirian threw a 50-yard pass to Iheanyi Uwaezuoke for the Saracens' second  touchdown and a 43-yard pass to Stafford Lee to set up Dahn's one-yard scoring  run.

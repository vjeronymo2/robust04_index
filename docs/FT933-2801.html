			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Zaire facing its 'worst human rights crisis' AMNESTY International accuses Zaire's security forces today of appalling human rights violations and urges the international community to intervene before there is a complete breakdown of law and order, Reuter reports from London. Amnesty says in a report that Zaire is facing its worst human rights crisis since the end of the civil war in the mid-1960s. It cites 'ruthless brutality of government security forces . . . who have murdered or tortured thousands of civilians and members of the peaceful political opposition'. The report, 'Zaire: Violence against Democracy', calls on the international community to devise ways to end the crisis.</p>

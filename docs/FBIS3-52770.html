The public is feeling gradually disillusioned by the  promises of the militants who have hitherto been extorting money  on one pretext or the other. They can no more organize public  demonstrations at will. The people who are developing faith in  the Indian security forces, much against Pakistan propaganda,  are walking away from the Pakistan-trained extremists. The  rising criminality in militant ranks and intergroup clashes are  leading to frequent shooting, extortion, and kidnapping and  harassment of women. The militants' guns are becoming a new  symbol of power as well as access to easy money. Again, like in  Punjab, the militants are resorting to recruit the youth at  gunpoint.    Pakistan is also now suspicious of the Kashmir militants.  The lack of faith in their capacity has resulted in greater  infiltration of Afghan and other militants by ISI [Interservice  Intelligence] to provide, what Pakistan says, leadership to  Kashmiri militants. With most Kashmiri pundits [Brahmans] having  fled the valley, militants, especially foreign mercenaries, have  turned to making the local Muslims as their target whether on  the suspicion of being police informers, settling personal  scores, or simple criminalization.    More than 1,700 Kashmiri Muslims have been killed since 1990  as against about 350 Hindus. Militants set on fire about 4,000  private houses, over 1,300 schools and government buildings, and  have abducted over 1,100 persons. There has been alarming  increase in abduction and extortion as the people of Kashmir  refuse to shelter the extremists now. More significantly,  public response to bundh [strike] calls by militants has been on  the decline, especially after the successful Hazratbal [shrine]  surrender with all their arms and foreign mercenaries.    The cleansing operations in Sopor, Baramula, and Anantnag --  all erstwhile strongholds of the militants -- are now  comparatively calm as the security forces have maintained the  pressure on extremists and have isolated them from the general  public. Headlong confrontation, which has been minimal, has  been confined to hard-core Kashmir militants and foreign  mercenaries, especially Afghans battle-hardened in the wars  against the Russian forces. This has led to increased and  indirect involvement of ISI of Pakistan. The Interservice  Intelligence of Pakistan is sending highly trained Pakistani and  Arab terrorists into Indian territory in a desperate bid to  establish a countrywide network and support system of subversion  and terrorism. A report of the U.S. House Republican Research  Committee says that ISI has developed a professional  infiltration route for their operations via Nepal because of  pressure on other areas to chalk out plans for carrying out  disturbances and sabotage in the Indian territory. The report  adds that highly trained terrorists of Jamaat-i-Tulaba with the  active support of organizations, such as the Indian Student  Islamic Movement, are carrying their activities in Indian soil.  The leadership has been taken away from the hands of Kashmiri  Muslims, especially JKLF [Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front].  Now, there is a direct Pakistan force operating in Kashmir.  Pakistan schemed to internationalize the issue and is leaving  no stone unturned.    The Indo-Pak talks were bound to end in fruitless exercise  as  was clear from the statements of Pakistan political and military  leadership. The statement of Ms. Benazir Bhutto that no talks  can move forward unless India concedes that Kashmir has a right  to secede only goes to show that she is quite incapable of being  reasonable about Kashmir and remaining as a prime minister. She  is not prepared to give the same right to Sindhis or northwest  frontier area of Pakistan that has all along been seeking the  right to secede.    The whole world knows that Bangladesh had to pay a very  heavy  price to the invading Pakistan forces. The failure of Pakistan  forces to get Kashmir by proxy war has led to new offensive to  seek international mediation. Pakistan was never sincere in  holding any talk to improve bilateral relations, much less solve  the Kashmir problem. It has no love for Kashmiri Muslims. It  only wants to annex Kashmir by whatever means. The leadership  in Pakistan knows that it cannot take Kashmir by force, hence it  is seeking international support, especially of ICO [Islamic  Conference Organization] countries, thinking that in the name of  religion, Muslim world would come to Pakistan aid. It reflects  a poor understanding of new world order by Pakistani leadership.</p>

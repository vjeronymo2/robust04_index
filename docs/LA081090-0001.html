			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> GLOBETROTTERS' MOORPARK VISIT UP IN THE AIR  </P> <P> The Harlem Globetrotters, renowned the world over for their basketball  wizardry, may be about to stage a new stunt at the Moorpark College Gymnasium  -- a disappearing training camp.  </P> <P> The Globetrotters, who trained last September at Cal State Northridge, have  been expected for months at Moorpark College, where two weeks of training and  an exhibition game are scheduled to begin Aug. 27. Revenues from the exhibition  game are earmarked for the college's sports program.  </P> <P> But Globetrotters General Manager Joe Anzivino said Thursday that the training  camp is "basically on hold at this moment" because the team may take a better  offer elsewhere.  </P> <P> Anzivino acknowledged that the team made an agreement with Moorpark College  about six months ago. But within the last two weeks, he said, the team received  word that the Globetrotters may be invited to appear on an upcoming ABC "Wide  World of Sports" program to be filmed at Disney World in Florida.  </P> <P> The team, which Anzivino said has a contract and a 17-year history of dealings  with the network, set a scheduling deadline of 2 p.m. Thursday. But that  deadline passed, Anzivino said, without a clear decision from the network.  </P> <P> Gerry Olsen, public information officer for Moorpark College, said that as of  Thursday, "we have not received tickets and we are not selling tickets for the  Sept. 9 game."  </P> <P> As for the prospect of the Globetrotters' training camp and game being held,  Olsen said, "any announcement regarding this should come from them."  </P> <P> Olsen said he could not say what the college's response to a cancellation would  be, other than disappointment. Anzivino said school officials have been very  cooperative.  </P> <P> The camp, which involves about two dozen players and about 60 Globetrotter  personnel, was scheduled to begin Aug. 27 and close Sept. 9 with a game between  the Globetrotters and their traditional opponents, the Washington Generals.  Tickets were to cost $10 each, with revenues to benefit the Moorpark College  athletic program and its 16 teams.  </P> <P> "The people of Moorpark are great," said Anzivino, a 29-year Globetrotter  employee who lives in Agoura. "If we did not do the camp at Moorpark this year,  it's simply a postponement. We will fulfill the commitment next year. In the  meantime, if this thing does switch to Florida, we plan to make a contribution  to the basketball program."  </P> <P> The contribution, he said, would be a four-figure cash gift -- an amount  comparable to the revenue the exhibition game could have generated.  </P> <P> The team's revenues from the television event in Florida, Anzivino said, are  likely to be "in six figures."  </P></p>

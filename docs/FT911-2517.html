			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Arts: Ravel, Strauss and Haydn - Weekend music in London The events of the London Symphony Orchestra's 'Childhood' series are being spread rather thinly. Too thinly, perhaps, for its theme - 'three centuries of music inspired by the experience of childhood' - fully to register as a coherent artistic statement. But in a single concert performance, that of the second of Ravel's two one-act operas, the enterprise must surely have found its surest point of focus; for under Michael TilsonThomas L'Enfant et les sortileges came up miraculously fresh. Even without benefit of stage props or movement, its ability to evoke all the exhilarations, caprices, fears and tender affections of childhood seemed on Sunday more acute and more precious than ever. The reason is that Tilson Thomas does not place knowing quotation marks around the subordinate episodes, comic or fantastic as may be, that form the opera's stages of dramatic development. He understands that in the performance of this work, simplicity of statement becomes a mark of high sophistication; he encouraged the orchestra (and the LS Chorus, on trim-voiced form) to deliver themselves with airy precision. The myriad colours and sound-inventions were touched in with absolute firmness and clarity. Some of the singers - Robert Tear as Teapot and Alfreda Hodgson as Chinese Cup were themost obvious examples - were tempted to show the audience just how much jolly good fun they were being, and having; but in the orchestra, at least, the faces were kept, in the best way, entirely straight. This directness was a quality shared by Frederica von Stade, whose Child was not just beautifully sung, in excellent French; it was acted, by means of touches of vocal colour and expressive nuances in the singer's platform demeanour, in a way that showed that all the singer's imaginative resources had been profoundly engaged. Other membersof the large cast who struck the right note included David Wilson-Johnson and Anne Howells as a pair of cats at once outrageously funny and strictly stylish, Constance Hauman as the Fire, and Helen Field (though lacking ideal purity of tone) as a poignantly vivid Princess. As prelude to this small, perfect masterpiece, there was a rather peculiar account of one of Benjamin Britten's comparative artistic failures: the 1969 Children's Crusade, dry in musical invention and second-hand (at least by Britten standards) in dramatic purpose. The Finchley Children's Music Group came out with full tone and authoritative attack, the various percussion and keyboard players likewise; but the attempt at staging seemed unconscionably arty, as well as painfully slow to get going. 'Mature' Strauss is a grab-bag, for all the famous tone-poems are 'early'. He was already 40 when he composed the Symphonia Domestica, his penultimate big-orchestra work; next year came the triumph of Salome - and then another 43 years' worth of operas, songs and little more but trumpery 'occasional' pieces. Only at the age of 70 did he return to honest symphonic composition, on a modest scale (the Oboe Concerto, the Metamorphosen); and music-lovers have a deeper affection for the Four Last Songs, which he wrote at the age of 84. Cheryl Studer sang those to a full house at the Royal Festival Hall on Sunday, with Zubin Mehta and the London Philharmonic. Mehta's programme was completed by two chunks of 'mature' orchestral music: Strauss's ultimate symphonic poem, the 1915 Alpine Symphony, and the 'Symphonic Fragment' that the conductor Clemens Krauss cobbled together from what Strauss had expected to be his last operatic score, Die Liebe der Danae. (He got carried away later and wrote Capriccio.) That was a useless exercise: nine minutes of Fragment, or rather fragments, neither convey the ripe, heartfelt variety of this neglected opera nor make good symphonicsense. Though Die Liebe der Danae is a forbiddingly expensive proposition, it is high time that some company summoned up the courage, and the cash, to do it justice. In the Four Last Songs Miss Studer was a joy. She is another of those young American singers who make smug European pretensions to special understanding seem absurd. Not only was she the first soprano I've heard in the concert hall who could project every phrase through Strauss's orchestral tapestry (with Mehta's faithful care), but she fastened unerringly upon the sense of each song. In the low register her timbre lacks character yet, but in every crucial passage her tone was lustrous, her phrasing exquisite. The Alpine Symphony, or more exactly 'An Alpine Symphony' - it isn't clear whether Strauss meant that it was a Symphony which happened to have an Alpine scenario, or expected it to be just one cliff-hanger among many - is at any rate a monster; but also great fun, if heard at suitably rare intervals. It is film-music for a documentary with aspirations; it goes on for a long time, deploys enormous forces with sovereign ingenuity, is pictorially dazzling and symphonically quite inert. Mehta shaped its episodes with so professional a hand as to keep one's ears pinned back, and the LPO played up splendidly. (The horns ran into some bad luck, but earlier the solo-horn postlude of the song 'September' far outweighed those lapses.) He stretched the central 'Vision' hard to extract every expressive drop, and still more the Ausklang epilogue: I remembered a late Barbirolli performance that milked the end of Ein Heldenleben in just such a way, moving my father to tears. This time, no tears were prompted: the post-climb peroration was rhetorically imposing, but nothing more. That might have been Mehta's fault  -but more likely, the music had nothing more to offer. Strauss knew wellenough when a vein was exhausted, and in the Alpine Symphony the vital pulse runs out. Andrew Davis and the BBC Symphony may have set a new speed record in Haydn's 'Nelson' Mass on Friday at the Festival Hall, but it was a tonic to hear. There were no signs of complaint from the players, despite the violins being revved up to escape-velocity in the Allegros; nor from the BBC Symphony Chorus, who were startlingly good, even virtuoso. Their chorus-master Stephen Jackson has brought this non-professional group to new heights. The sopranos were intrepid and unanimous, the collective diction bright, the balance of parts beautifully transparent. In the heroic solo soprano role Rita Cullis made a slightly anxious start, but from the Gloria onward she was strong and lucid. With far less to do, the other soloists all made their marks: the mezzo Susan Bickleywith lovely tone in the later movements, the tenor Kim Begley in ringing style,David Wilson-Johnson soberly moving in the Qui tollis. Amidst this whole exuberant reading, the famous irruption of warning trumpets made no great shock; more typical was the playful, dancing close, which Davis plainly relished. Soprano and bass lent their wordless voices to the slow movement of Nielsen's Symphony no. 3, the 'Sinfonia espansiva', which Davis addressed with lively purpose. Clean formal lines, precise attention to Nielsen's original colour-contrasts,terrific energy: the Allegretto and Finale, indeed, were enthusiastic to the point of violence. I preferred Davis's cooler exposition of the earlier movements,which brought out Nielsen's quirky symphonic thinking to secure effect. But thetotal impression was friendly, and the symphony certainly gained by the sharp silhouette Davis gave it. The concert had begun with Sibelius's Swan of Tuonela. While the cor anglais proceeded with its doleful song, Davis lavished subtleties upon the orchestral accompaniment, which became too greedy for one's attention. In this 'river of the dead' there were too many restless currents forthe serene magic of the piece to establish its spell. In its way this was nevertheless an expert performance, and a neat introduction to the tougher Nielsen work. It was the Haydn, though, that would go on ringing happily in the mind's ear.</p>

			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Letter: Retrospective changes to pensions not practical Sir, In your editorial 'Sex and the over 60s' (March 28) you accurately describe the quagmire in which occupational pension schemes find themselves following the Barber judgment of the European Court of Justice in May 1990 and the recent decision of an industrial tribunal in favour of Mr Alan Roscoe. A key problem is the failure to recognise the essential feature of the UK system, whereby occupational pensions are generally earned and paid for during an employee's service. Making retrospective changes to pensions already earned would mean varying the terms of employment long after the service has been rendered, which is not a practical proposition. The National Association of Pension Funds (NAPF) is keen that equality in occupational and state pensions should be achieved as soon as possible. On the other hand it believes that equality should not be applied compulsorily to pensions which had already been earned before the Barber judgment and which employers reasonably believed had been paid for. Such a move could cause serious problems for the business of employers who provide company pensions and so threaten the existence of their pension schemes. Employers do not have to provide pension schemes for their employees. Many have decided to do so and as a result they have accepted extra costs. It would penalise them unreasonably for that decision if they were now burdened with even more costs. Equality can be achieved without compulsion. In our recent survey covering more than 830 major schemes run by NAPF members, we found that more than half of them had already equalised. This trend would be accelerated if, as we have repeatedly urged, the government equalised state pension ages.

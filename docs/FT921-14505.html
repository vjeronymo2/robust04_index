			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / International Company News: Ever Ready helps Bhopal pariah regain its balance - Union Carbide India MR VIJAY GOKHALE, head of Union Carbide India (UCIL), goes to extraordinary lengths to distance his group's name from the Ever Ready batteries that it produces. This is his strategy to protect the income of the group, which become a pariah overnight after the Bhopal gas disaster which killed more than 3,000 people and injured 200,000 in December 1984. In spite of seven years of public UCIL-bashing, the batteries continue to sell as briskly as ever. Significantly, in an industry where three leading players have closed down, UCIL has managed to maintain sales growth and its market share of about 42 per cent. The results of the latest six months have been particularly good. Sales rose sharply by 23 per cent to Rs1.36bn (Dollars 53.3m), while gross profit moved up by 8 per cent to Rs950,000. 'We would have done even better if our factory in Kashmir had been working. We sell everything we produce,' says Mr Utpal Basu, finance director. This factory, which accounts for 29 per cent of UCIL's battery production capacity, has been closed for the past 20 months because of local law and order problems. UCIL has a total of 10 factories in India and a subsidiary in Nepal, producing 504m batteries annually, as well as battery intermediates and battery-related products such as torches. Even more significantly, the sales growth was in spite of a directive - never officially stated - banning UCIL advertisements on all government-controlled media. 'We used to be big radio advertisers. After Bhopal, we found it difficult to get our advertisements accepted. So we decided to keep low, trim our ad budget, and pay more attention to rural markets,' says Mr Kishore Hattangadi, corporate communications manager. Today, barely 40 per cent of UCIL's sales are in urban areas. Another outcome of the disaster is that every UCIL application for modernisation, new projects or expansion has been turned down. Money became tight for the company, with banks wary of lending to a concern which did not know what liabilities would arise from the disaster. With these problems, UCIL needed to take on additional talented managers, but because of its image recruitment was extremely difficult. Perhaps inevitably, this experience has left UCIL a trimmer and fitter company. Internal communications are swifter, the management of working capital tighter, and productivity higher. Moreover, UCIL has shed more than 2,000 workers from its over-staffed payroll since 1984. Today, it employs 6,460 people. Over 1,000 dropped out when UCIL sold its petrochemical business in 1988 and a substantial number accepted voluntary retirement schemes. Mr Gokhale, who is chairman and chief executive, says proudly: 'We have not had a major strike since 1984.' However, recent labour problems, aggravated by a politically-charged atmosphere at UCIL's Calcutta plant, may mar this record. Except for this one problem, there is a strong sense of optimism at UCIL's Bombay headquarters. 'We survived and . . . we are back in business,' says Mr Gokhale. 'We would like to lease the closed facilities of former competitors. Software is emerging as a sunrise business, and we would like to enter this field. Building components is another area we are looking at,' he explains. His enthusiasm may be premature. The October 1991 Indian Supreme Court judgment rejecting appeals that UCIL increase the Dollars 470m settlement reached in 1989 - but lifting criminal immunity  - may have closed the first chapter. However, the Indian government has since reopened the case for criminal liability and the Bhopal High Court wants Mr Warren Anderson, president of Union Carbide of the US, to appear before it on February 1 this year. Government permissions may therefore continue to be elusive. Aware of this, Mr Gokhale perseveres in brushing the dust off old project reports. It is the same spirit which enabled him unflinchingly to head a company responsible for the deaths of thousands, meet hostile journalists head-on and support UCIL's demoralised employees.</p>

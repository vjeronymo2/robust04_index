			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Mahmud 'Abbas, member of the PLO </F> Executive Committee, in Tunis, by Ashraf 'Abd-al-'Aziz, in  Cairo, date not given; from the "Dialogue From Afar" program --  live or recorded]    [Text] ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Welcome to our program.    ['Abbas] Thank you.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] A new round of Palestinian-Israeli talks has  started in Cairo over the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho  agreement. The Economic Affairs Committee also resumed its work  in Paris. What have these talks achieved?    ['Abbas] Significant progress has been achieved in the  latest  round of talks in Cairo. The two sides worked out full details  concerning the police force. This topic is now closed. Once  the signal is given, the police force will be ready to deploy.  The issue has been fully discussed.    The talks in Cairo also focused on the civilian [local  administration] functions. Only one of these functions needs  further discussion. The current round of talks may finalize  this issue as well.    Economic issues are being discussed in Paris. Economic  issues, we all know, are numerous and complicated. At issue are  concerns such as customs, taxes, trade, merchandise, labor, and  currency. I can say there has been some 90-percent progress in  this regard. I expect that issues concerning both the economy  and the civilian administration will be resolved in the current  round of talks.    If some issues remain unsettled, the two sides will decide  whether to hold further negotiations to resolve them or begin  implementing the agreement immediately It all depends on what  the two sides will agree upon.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] What are the most important of the  unresolved  issues?    ['Abbas] They have to do with security, the crossings,  geographic jurisdiction, and the judiciary. There are quite a  few snags here and there and although we cannot shrug them off,  I think it is advisable to begin the implementation and let the  talks go on. This is what we plan to tell the Israelis.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] What is the real cause of the remaining  differences between the Palestinians and Israelis?    ['Abbas] It has to do with the interpretation of the  Declaration of Principles. Every side is trying to interpret it  in the way that suits them, to tell you the truth. The  Declaration of Principles is a document that needs  interpretation and clarification and gives rise to differing  views and a bit of horse-trading. This is the reason for the  differences.    Naturally, the Israelis want to hold on to the land and the  authority they have until the very last. They find it hard to  let go.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] The recent incidents in the occupied  territories have proven that Israel's security claims are unreal  and that there is a need for Palestinian security as well.    ['Abbas] I hope the Israelis will understand this, namely,  that both the Israelis and Palestinians need security. I hope  the Israelis will also understand that the issue is actually one  of confidence, not security. We are discussing peace. If we  have genuine intentions of making peace, real security and other  measures will certainly be taken without reference to texts.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Recent Israeli statements say the  Palestinian-Israeli Agreement will be signed soon. Is this true?    ['Abbas] I cannot give dates or depend on dates. I say that  when work on the basic and necessary files is completed, the two  sides will be ready for signing and implementation. There is  another point: The two sides may finish with some files and  agree to begin implementation while negotiations on the  remaining files continue. This is decided through negotiations.  But we cannot say the signing will be tomorrow, the day after,  next week, or in two weeks. A single word or minor problem may  obstruct the signing. We cannot give people false hopes that  may not be fulfilled.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Should we expect a summit meeting between  Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin very soon?    ['Abbas] When a summit is decided, it will mean the  implementation of the agreement has started. Such a summit will  be meant to announce the implementation, not to hold  negotiations.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Mahmud 'Abbas: The file of the Palestinian  police force was closed after an agreement was reached. Is the  force prepared to assume security on the Palestinian territory?    ['Abbas] Yes. Of course. The force will be ready. It is.  When it enters Palestinian territory, it will start assuming its  national responsibilities on its land.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] This is my last question. The multilateral  talks on water are now being held in Muscat, Oman. A  Palestinian delegation is participating. What are the  Palestinian proposals at these talks?    ['Abbas] We make no Palestinian proposals. We make Arab  ones. We cooperate with the Arab brothers taking part in these  negotiations. The water issue is of concern not only to the  Palestinians, but to all Arab sides in the Middle East. Any  views we may offer, therefore, must be in harmony with the views  of our brothers who are attending the talks or are concerned  with this issue.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Thank you.    ['Abbas] You are welcome.</p>

			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Argos says Budget may kill recovery ARGOS chairman Mr David Donne yesterday issued a warning to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, that any tax increases in his November Budget could destroy the 'fragile' recovery in consumer confidence and devastate retailers' profits. His warning came as the catalogue retailer revealed a 39 per cent rise in profits to Pounds 13.2m for the 24 weeks to June 19, on sales up 10.3 per cent to Pounds 365.9m. Mr Donne highlighted the threat posed to retailers by the decision to move the Budget from March to November. He warned any increase in income tax or value added tax could snuff out improvement in consumer confidence. Some retailers make 90 per cent of their profits during the Christmas and new year trading period. 'Relative growth in sales is getting stronger but it is slow and fragile,' he said. 'Increasing taxes in the Budget could have a serious impact on the all-important Christmas trading period.' Argos said sales were on a 'gentle upward trend', and had increased throughout the first half. Trading was still stronger in the north than in the south of England, but the gap was narrowing. Excluding the impact of newly opened stores, sales had increased 5.9 per cent, but much of this was due to 'management initiatives' including expanding the range of some of its stores and changes to its catalogues. Argos estimated the underlying increase in consumer spending at 1.8 per cent, against a 0.9 per cent fall in the first half of 1992, and a 1 per cent increase in the second half.

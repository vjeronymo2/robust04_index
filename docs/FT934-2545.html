			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Norwegians buy 25,000 tonnes of British rail British Steel Track Products, based at Workington in northern England, has won its biggest ever European order from Norwegian State Railways, which is buying 25,000 tonnes of rail. The order is understood to be worth about Pounds 10m, and took two years to negotiate. It will run to the end of 1995, and could be extended to the end of the century. The rails are to be used in NSB's expansion programme. It is upgrading strategic routes to take trains capable of 120mph. The Workington plant has changed production to make the 40-metre rails for NSB, four metres longer than it had be able to make.</p>

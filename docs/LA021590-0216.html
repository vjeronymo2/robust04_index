			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEATHS OF 4 SEA OTTERS LEAD TO TIGHTER CURBS ON GILL NETS  </P> <P> State fish and game officials say they will further restrict the use of gill  nets in a small area of the Central Coast waters after the weekend deaths of  four sea otters.  </P> <P> The sea otters -- classified a "threatened" species -- were entangled and  killed in a fine-filament gill net near Monterey.  </P> <P> Al Petrovich, chief of the Fish and Game Department's marine resources  division, said he was informed that a state-paid ocean observer -- looking  through a land-based telescope -- saw a fisherman take the four dead otters  from his gill net off Ragged Point. The number of dead otters reported was  unusually high for one net and brought documented deaths of the threatened  marine mammal to six this year.  </P> <P> "We've had them trickle in periodically, one here and one there," Petrovich  said about dead otter reports. "But not four."  </P> <P> Petrovich said the state is now drafting an emergency measure that would allow  commercial boats in the Ragged Point area to use their gill nets only in water  180 feet or deeper. Existing regulations permit gill nets in water as shallow  as 120 feet. Petrovich said the boats use gill nets on the Central Coast to  catch halibut, which bring fishermen as much as $2.25 a pound.  </P> <P> The use of gill nets in California coastal waters is a simmering controversy,  which has pitted commercial fishermen against environmentalists and  recreational fishermen. Operators of commercial boats say the nets are  efficient, but the environmentalists say the fine-filament mesh  indiscriminately kills endangered marine mammals such as porpoises and otters.  </P> <P> Environmentalists and game fishermen are currently gathering signatures to  place a measure on the November ballot to ban the use of gill nets in the  coastal waters of Southern California.  </P></p>

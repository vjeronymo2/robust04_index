			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Political commentary" by Yahya Rabah, Palestinian </F> representative in Sanaa: "Illusions of Exile and Realities of  the Homeland"]    [Text] By now, the Palestinian opposition factions must  have realized, beyond any doubt or ambiguity, that the  PLO-Israeli Declaration of Principles agreement is an  established fact, and that the ceiling of the required and  legitimate struggle is how to embody the Palestinian reading of  this agreement to try to rid it of its drawbacks and build on  its positive aspects in the interest of the Palestinian people.    Speaking about foiling the agreement is no more than talk  meant to justify avoiding the battle waged by the Palestinian  people now to establish their national entity, lay the  foundations of an independent Palestinian state, and open all  practical, objective doors toward achieving all Palestinian  rights.    We hope that our brothers in the Palestinian opposition  factions would end their escape, based on the following facts:    First, the room for maneuver of these factions is getting  smaller, despite their recent statement in which they said that  the Palestine question is an Islamic and pan-Arab affair. All  Arab and Islamic countries, in line with their interests and  strategies, deal with this question, at best, through a national  and regional perspective. Perhaps, we are now at the threshold  of a stage in which these factions will not find a place for  their own security except in a Palestinian safe haven.    Second, it is the policy of these factions to adhere to form  rather than substance, and this cannot last long. We have  noticed that, during the recent meetings of these factions, they  avoided discussing any issues of substance. They only agreed on  formalities that do not give an accurate reflection of reality,  such as the illusion that collective leadership and democratic  action lie only in equal representation and periodic leadership.  To stress that this question has to do with formalities and is  not in line with reality, we say that the alliance between the  Democratic Front [for the Liberation of Palestine] and the  Popular Front [for the Liberation of Palestine] on the one hand  and Hamas on the other, which was implemented during the Bi'r  Zayt University elections, was not observed in the elections of  the Islamic University in Gaza. This is a natural thing. The  Hamas Movement, for example, would not play the game of an  alliance in form only all the time. This is in light of its  size. This means that hard realities shall always conquer weak  alliances.    Third, Palestinian public opinion wants the Palestinian  factions to gear their national resistance capabilities toward  development by adopting a practical approach for action, and not  by escape. This is especially true since the banner of  Palestinian national dialogue is held high by the legitimate  leadership of the Palestinian people, the PLO leadership, and by  a major, broad current of our people, particularly in the main  arena of the homeland itself.    Based on the above, we wish the Palestinian opposition  factions would end their state of national loss, which they  brought on themselves as a result of adhering to the language  and conduct of the past and as a result of their dependence on  realities which they thought are fixed and would not change.  The truth is these realities are changeable and complex.    Whatever they do, the opposition factions are part of our  national struggle and entity, and we care for this part. We do  not want to see those factions blown away by the winds outside  time and space. We do not want the Palestinian opposition to  establish their existence on an illusory island which is, in  reality, the back of a sleeping crocodile that will awake and  drown the illusory island. Yes, the banner of dialogue and  participation is held high. For the first time in history, we,  Palestinians, are going to a homeland of our own that carries  our name to start our life. Perhaps reality does not match  one's expectations. However, participation in building the  homeland, no matter how modest, is a thousand times better than  illusory heroism in alliances in exile, which will not last  long.</p>

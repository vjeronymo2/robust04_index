			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / International Company News: Chicago insurer falls to Dollars 29.9m KEMPER, the Chicago insurance and financial services company, suffered a drop in first-quarter net income to Dollars 29.9m, or 61 cents per share, from Dollars 51.5m, or Dollars 1.08 per share, last year. Mr David Mathis, chairman, said a decline in net investment income, particularly from the company's life insurance segment, hurt first-quarter operating earnings, which dropped to Dollars 35.1m from Dollars 49.3m last year. Included in the first-quarter results are after-tax realised investment losses of Dollars 5.2m, or 11 cents per share, compared with after-tax investment gains in the year ago quarter of Dollars 2.2m, or 5 cents per share. The company had after-tax charges of Dollars 2.6m, against potential losses on properties, and Dollars 1.8m to write down below investment grade securities. Kemper life insurance investment portfolios were more conservatively positioned late last year in moves which included reductions in below investment grade securities. Kemper Securities, once the poor sister of the corporation, was its star performer in the first quarter. It reported net income of Dollars 3.6m, or 7 cents per share, up from Dollars 929,000, or 2 cents per share, for the same period last year. Performance in the insurance side was mixed. Life insurance reported a net loss of Dollars 4.7m, against net income last year of Dollars 8.5m; reinsurance's net income declined to Dollars 7.3m from Dollars 10.2m; property-casualty also reported a decline to Dollars 9.8m from Dollars 13m in the first quarter of 1991. The company's asset management operations reported net income of Dollars 20.7m, up marginally from Dollars 19.3m last year.</p>

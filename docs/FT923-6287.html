			<p>920825 FT  25 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets: Dollar speeds up European decline The downward trend on European equity markets is gathering pace as the weakness in the dollar and sterling, and fears of higher interest rates in the UK, undermine investor confidence. Mr Gary Dugan, European strategist at Baring Securities, believes that worse is to come before investors can hope for any sort of recovery. He expects a further fall of between 5 to 10 per cent before European markets reach support levels and buyers are tempted back into the market. In retrospect, it has been poor second-quarter results from blue chip companies across Europe, and particularly from Germany, that has triggered the decline, he says. Further evidence of weakness in Germany is expected this week when two chemical companies report their interims. Baring is forecasting that BASF will show a 35 per cent drop in second-quarter earnings from the year-ago period, while it estimates a 22 per cent fall in Hoescht's figures. On the other hand, research by Mr Joe Rooney, European strategist at James Capel, suggests that not all cyclical stocks have been damaged by the deepening economic recession. Since January 1991, Akzo, Rhone Poulenc and Ciba-Geigy have outperformed other European chemical issues in local currency terms, which supports the case that fund managers are being very selective. Nevertheless, he remains cautious about the chances for a turnround this year. 'I think we will continue to see downgradings of companies across Europe throughout this year, and until people are confident that interest rates will come down, things look set to remain as they are,' he says. The weakness of the dollar was one, but by no means the most important, factor which affected sentiment last week. The publication of new opinion polls in France indicating that a 'yes' vote in the September referendum on the Maastricht treaty was less than certain not only upset the Paris equity market but also caused unrest to spread to other bourses. Unfounded fears that Germany might be forced to raise its Lombard rate added to the negative mood, while Hafnia's suspension of payments mid-week weighed on the share prices of a number of leading institutions with stakes in the Danish insurer. The European segment of the FT-Actuaries World index only showed a slight fall on the week, helped by technical rallies in Austria and Italy after their steep declines during the summer. However, excluding the UK, the index has dropped 2.5 per cent in the August month and is more than 8 per cent down on the quarter. The world index was nearly 2 per cent stronger on the week as Japan pulled out of its recent slide. Other world markets remained mixed last week, with the best performance coming from Japan as it responded to the government's measures aimed at supporting equities. But Tokyo's rebound has done little to encourage markets in the Pacific Rim.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Quito, 8 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Ecuadoran President Sixto  Duran Ballen announced today the appointment of his new  information and tourism minister, the third to fill the post  created a little over one and a half years ago.    At a discreet ceremony held this afternoon in the Carondelet  Palace, the seat of the Ecuadoran Government, Duran Ballen  appointed and swore in Armando Espinel to replace Carlos Vera.    The Information and Tourism Ministry post was created on 10  August 1992 when Duran Ballen's administration began. Its first  minister was Pedro Zambrano, who died in 1992 in an airplane  accident in Quito.    Former Minister Carlos Vera was at the palace to turn over  the post to Espinel, a renowned businessmen in national and  international tourist circles. After 14 months at the head of  the ministry, Vera resigned on 22 February due to public  differences with Vice President Alberto Dahik. The differences  came to light when Dahik said the government was studying a  plebiscite to learn of the people's opinion about possible  reforms to the Constitution. Vera expressed his disagreement and  argued that the announcement of such a significant topic should  be exclusively reserved for the president.    At the transfer-of-command ceremony, Duran-Ballen denied  rumors about the possible elimination of the Information and  Tourism Ministry. The president announced that the ministry will  be restructured and tourist development efforts will be promoted  on an international level. He said that the Press Office of the  Presidency will be in charge of information and attention to  media representatives until a special office is created for that  purpose.    Espinel is an experienced businessman who has connections  with the tourist sector in Ecuador and abroad. Among the  relevant posts he has held is that of president of the Tourism  Conference of Latin America.</p>

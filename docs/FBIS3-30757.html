			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] During coalition talks in Bratislava today, Vladimir  Meciar, the prime minister and chairman of the Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia, called on Ludovit Cernak, the chairman of  the Slovak National Party [SNS], to resign from the post of  deputy chairman of the National Council. He justified this by  saying that Mr. Cernak had refused to give guarantees that he  would coordinate the parliament's session on 16 February in a  way that would ensure a joint action by all coalition members.    Speaking at a news briefing, the prime minister went on to  say that representatives of the opposition held talks on methods  of turning the discussion on the big privatization bill into an  immediate political solution and noted that they would express a  lack of confidence in Parliament Chairman Ivan Gasparovic. This  failed to happen only because the Party of the Democratic Left  rejected it, Vladimir Meciar added.    SNS Honorable Chairman Jozef Prokes confirmed the prime  minister's statement that they proposed an open coalition  [otvorena koalicia] to the Party of the Democratic Left [PDL].  He said the response of PDL representatives was slightly  negative but not altogether dismissive.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Cape Verdean President Antonio Mascarenhas  Monteiro arrived just before 2400 at Lisbon airport. He is to  attend a congress of Cape Verdean cadres. Walter Medeiros  interviewed him.    [Begin recording] [Medeiros] [passage omitted] What are you  hoping for from this congress?    [Mascarenhas] Well, this congress is a historic event of  capital importance because as you know Cape Verde places great  trust in its diaspora. We believe that it is an integral part  of the Cape Verde nation.    I will have the honor of opening the first congress of Cape  Verdean cadres abroad, and I believe that this congress  represents a strong wish of the diaspora to participate in the  development of Cape Verde.    [Medeiros] Will you appeal to them to invest more in their  country and appeal also for national unity, as is known more  Cape Verdeans live outside the country than inside?    [Mascarenhas] Obviously it will also be an appeal. I believe  at the moment the conditions have been met to enable all Cape  Verdeans to participate in the process of deepening our  democracy and of laying the foundations for a sustainable  economic development.    I hope that palpable results will emerge from the congress  for the good of Cape Verde and the good of the diaspora.    [Medeiros] [passage omitted] Has Cape Verde the conditions  to  receive its people living abroad?    [Mascarenhas] Of course not. At the moment we have about  600,000 or 700,000 Cape Verdeans abroad, which is virtually  twice the number of those living in Cape Verde. But I believe  that the diaspora can participate, can make its contribution,  and we are counting on it.    So, this congress will be a landmark in bringing the Cape  Verdeans abroad closer to their motherland. I hope the congress  will take place and will be a successful one.    [Medeiros] [passage omitted] What is the future for a  Lusophone commonwealth?    [Mascarenhas] I think a rosy future, because it is a  community that has virtues and potential to develop. The seven  Portuguese-speaking countries are countries with very strong  historic and cultural ties. I would even say there is great  solidarity and fraternity; these values must be preserved and  deepened. [end recording]</p>

[Discua] I think it is incomplete. He said it is a  preliminary report, and it does not mention criminal actions  that occurred at the time -- kidnappings, sabotage, bank  robberies, murders. I want to mention this because many people  were kidnapped and killed in the course of Police operations.  Consequently, I believe there are widows and orphans who also  have the right to be taken into consideration by the human  rights commissioner.    [Valladares] Do you remember the names of the kidnapped  persons?    [Discua] I remember the names of people who were the subject  of extortion. I apologize to the honorable people I will mention  here. They were published by the press, so I can mention them.  Everything I will mention was published by the press at the  time. I repeat, there is nothing in the Armed Forces files in  connection with the missing persons problem.    I can mention Dr. [Paul] Vinelli, who was released after a  ransom was paid. I do not know the amount because it was never  mentioned but it was certainly reported by the press. Mr.  [first name not given] Casanova. When he was released, some  Police members died [five-second break in reception].    [Valladares] Gen. Gustavo Alvarez Martinez appointed you  commander of the 3-16 Battalion in 1984. Majors Oscar Rene  Barahona and Vicente Rafael Canales were your subalterns. Tell  me something about the 3-16 Battalion. What was the objective  when it was created?    [Discua] Look, it is not a squad, it is a combat  intelligence battalion. If Gen. Alvarez Martinez made the  appointment, I was not summoned until 15 January that same year.  At the time I was, first of all, a member of the Army staff. I  assumed the responsibility of that post on 1 January, excuse me,  on 1 February 1984, and the unit was organized. The unit did  not exist prior to 1984.    I was entrusted with the mission of organizing the combat  intelligence unity, the objective of which was to carry out  intelligence missions in support of the three infantry brigades  that existed at the time. They were the 110th, 105th, and  101st. If you add all three numbers you get 316. The brigade's  mission was to provide combat information and intelligence in  support of these three brigades, which at that time could have  become involved in a war at any moment.    That is when I was assigned to this brigade. I left the  country to seek advice from U.S. Army Intelligence, and I  visited several intelligence units. I visited the Combat  Intelligence School -- I want to clarify this to avoid any  misunderstanding. I then drafted a bill, which I have with me,  that clearly defined the unit's mission. I left that unit  exactly at the end of March. On 6 April, I was appointed to the  100th Infantry Battalion.    [Valladares] How long did you head the 3-16?    [Discua] As I said, I was assigned to it for two months, but  I spent very little time there because....[pauses] If you check  the immigration records, you can see that I spent most of the  time in the United States or in other places seeing how this  combat intelligence support unit should be formed.    [Valladares] Leo Valladares' report alleges that this  squadron kidnapped, tortured, and killed several Hondurans  during the eighties. What orders did you issue when you  occupied the post? Do you really think this battalion had  nothing to do with what is said, or did it turn bad?    [Discua] I can only vouch for the time that I was in charge.  After 6 April I was assigned to the 5th Battalion, then the 9th  Infantry Battalion, and from there to the chief of staff of the  Public Security Force, where I was stationed for only two  months. From there I was assigned to the 2d Infantry Battalion.  I cannot answer for the rest of the time because immediately  afterward I became totally detached from it. This can be  proved...[pauses] the same documents that were presented...    [Valladares, interrupting] You didn't issue any orders?    [Discua] At no time. I am a good Catholic, therefore I do  not do what I do not want done unto me. I never issued such an  order to any person under my command. My problem was how to  organize it, and I presented a draft bill.    [Valladares] General, the people are closely following this  interview on HRN. You never issued orders to arrest anyone?    [Discua] Never.    [Valladares] Do you believe military members who were part  of  the 3-16 Battalion should be investigated?    [Discua] I want to say that the intelligence battalion was  dismantled by an agreement in 1987. In other words...[pauses]  I have the agreement here with me. It is Agreement 21-92 of  the commander in chief of the Armed Forces, who at the time was  Gen. Humberto Regalado. The agreement says to deactivate the  Logistic Support Command, the Communications Corps, and the 3-16  Intelligence Battalion. It says to activate from 1 September  1987 the 1st Communications Battalion and the Army Logistic  Support Battalion. It is clear here. You can see it here.    [Valladares] General, what can you say about the request  made by Cofadeh [Comittee of Relatives of Missing Detainees in  Honduras]?    [Discua] Well, what can I say? Every Honduran citizen  definitely has the right to resort to every legal resource  available. If there is going to be justice in this country, it  is first necessary for the report on that period to be  completed. That report is incomplete. I call on all those  widows, people who were tortured, and orphans who have not  appeared before the human rights commissioner to do so, because  I think it is necessary to complete the report. Because if ...    [Valladares, interrupting] Is the report incomplete?    [Discua] It is totally incomplete. By 1991 an amnesty had  been declared, and several of the people who reentered the  country affirmed that they had participated in kidnappings,  holdups, and deaths as well as the murder of Gen. [first name  indistinct] Martinez. Those statements were broadcast and  printed by the media for everyone to see. Back then they were  common crimes because they were criminal acts, yet the amnesty  protected those people. They were never put on trial because  they took advantage of the amnesty. The presidency of the  Republic and the Armed Forces ratified and supported the  amnesty, which gave ample protection to everyone who  participated in criminal acts.    [Valladares] Congress has approved three amnesties in the  past decade. Should those three amnesties also include the  military?    [Discua] We should carefully analyze the law in this  respect.  I do not have a copy of the amnesty that was declared during  that period. However, I would like to say that the last  amnesty, Decree No. 87-91, which appeared in the official  gazette, reads: To provide wide and unconditional amnesty to  all persons sentenced, indicted, or subject to arraignment in  any court of the Republic charged with political, common, or  related crimes included in Chapter 12 to 9, both incorporated  into crimes against the security, interest of the state, penal  code, and so forth. Further on it says: Chapter 1 of the  military code related to political crimes committed prior to the  effective date of the present decree; in other words, the  amnesty is blanket and unconditional since many people benefited  at the time. Those persons were in one way or another involved  in kidnappings, deaths, and murders during that period.    [Valladares] General, what can you say to the Honduran  people about reports indicating that you could be called to  testify in court?    [Discua] I can say sincerely that I feel at peace. If I did  not meet with the media at an earlier date, it was because I do  not like to discuss certain issues in public. I respect the  media a great deal. Threats have been made against me through  the media, and some serious words have been used against me.    [Valladares] Personally, how do you feel?    [Discus] Personally, I feel at peace. I am a bit annoyed  because I think that sometimes people make decisions based on  emotions, resentment, and hatred. I understand their pain. I  think we should respect each other. I do not insult people nor  do I try to do it because that is not my style. I repeat: I  respect all human beings because that is how I was raised.  [passage omitted]    [Valladares] I have two final questions. Do you feel  completely innocent in the case of the missing people? Yes or  no.    [Discua] Yes, definitely.    [Valladares] How do you view the support the Superior  Council  of the Armed Forces has given you?    [Discua] The Superior Council has been informed of all these  events because I visit all the units, one by one, and I issue  reports. I do not ignore the fact that I have adversaries in  the institution. Remember that I am head of the institution. I  am the shield of the institution. I represent the institution.  Therefore, I am the target of all sorts of attacks. I, Luis  Alonso Discua, am at the head at this moment, but it could have  been somebody else. That other person would be facing the same  situation, because right now there is an Army reduction policy  in effect. Situations are being sought out to justify the  elimination of some institutions.    But remember, we are independent. We have our own national  identity. The Armed Forces have the fundamental mission of  safeguarding this country's democratic system. This is first,  and we will always struggle for a legal state and for respect  for everybody's rights.    [Valladares] What message do you have for the Honduran  people, who are listening to you because as you have said, they  had been waiting for you to make this type of statement?    [Discua] First, I want to apologize to the Honduran people  for not having addressed the situation before; not out of fear,  no. I did it because I do not like confrontations, I do not  like to speculate. I represent a very serious institution and I  respect other people's suffering. I respect all people,  especially the ladies who at one time or another have referred  to me in a very nasty way. I respect their opinion. I accept  their pain, but I believe that people should not be prejudged,  that accusers should resort to the services to which all  citizens are entitled.</p>

			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: The driest of dry Martinis Sir, Your correspondent Giles MacDonogh (Food &amp; Drink, June 25/26) rightly warns of the perils of crossing the Atlantic to arrive in time for pre-prandial martinis. He does not, however, define the real vintage American Martini. The ingredients for this, as practised by an old friend of mine from California, are: Bottle Extra Dry Martini, corked not screw-topped; Beefeater 47 per cent gin; Lemon peel; Large 'V' glass. Keep above in refrigerator. To make, remove ingredients from refrigerator. Add two blocks of white ice to glass and pour over gin to top of glass. Add twist of lemon rind. Briefly invert Martini bottle to wet cork. Remove cork and pass over glass. Replace cork. Serve. This makes a truly dry Martini. I have enjoyed many over the last 25 years and I swear that my friend is still using the same bottle of Martini. Peter G Barnes, 73 The Park, St Albans, Hertfordshire AL1 4RX</p>

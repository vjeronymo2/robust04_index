			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / A time for companies to stand up for their rights: Maggie Urry analyses reasons behind a possible shortage in the supply of capital ACCORDING to stock market gossip, there is a flood of rights issues coming. The rise in the market has enticed companies to raise new equity capital, to bolster balance sheets, finance recovery or fund acquisitions. But there are doubts as to how much investors are prepared or able to stump up for new equity. There is concern that the government's heavy borrowing programme in the 1993-94 fiscal year will 'crowd out' companies and take cash needed by industry for recovery. Says one senior corporate financier: 'My advice to clients is: 'If it's there, grab it'.' Another says: 'We are advising clients to go early.' One large Scottish institutional investor is gloomy about prospects for issues. He says institutional liquidity levels are low and thinks that by next month these investors' appetites for new equity may already be fading. After that only companies with a particularly good case for raising money will get issues away. Institutional cash is not the only source of funds for investment in equities and government stocks, but it is the most reliable, as private and overseas investors are more fickle. Although cashflows into institutions have risen in the past couple of years  - in spite of pension fund contribution holidays  - the demands on cash, especially from the government, have risen more quickly. In round numbers, NatWest Securities, the stockbroker, estimates institutional cashflow this year will be about Pounds 40bn. It estimates that net gilt sales in the 1993 calendar year might be Pounds 38bn or Pounds 39bn. But a further Pounds 11bn will be accounted for by equity issues, including rights, the expected ICI demerger issue, flotations and government sales of shares, less cash put back into the market through takeovers. On these numbers supply of capital does not match demand. This year the crunch could come after April as the government needs to fund the huge public sector deficit in the coming fiscal year. So far this year three companies have made Pounds 100m-plus equity issues: Asda, the superstore operator with a Pounds 347m rights; Burton, the fashion retailer with a Pounds 161m rights; and Wessex Water with a rights and other funding raising Pounds 144.5m. Numerous others have been named by rumourmongers as likely candidates for an issue, often because their balance sheets are strained and seem to need an injection of equity. But while the list of potential issuers is long, that of successful issues is likely to be shorter. Both Asda and Burton were able to point to recovery programmes initiated by new management as a justification for raising money. Both had 'rescue' rights issues in 1991  - now they are making recovery issues, and were well received. As well as rumours of more retailers making cash calls, the market can expect rights issues from 'traditional manufacturing companies', says one banker. The insurance sector is also seen as a probable source of issues. These companies can point to a coming cyclical upswing which is well understood by investors. Investors' patience is likely to be much thinner with companies which want to raise cash to repair balance sheets weakened by reduced profits and asset write-downs. The key may be a change in management. The reaction could be 'Why give money to the people who got us into this mess,' one banker says. This may exclude many of the rumoured issuers. While the contracting and construction sector is thought of as needing new equity, many of these companies will find it hard to give investors good reasons for putting up more cash. Nor are they prepared to contribute to companies' 'war chests', although an actual deal at the right price would find sympathy, as Wessex Water's cash call did. Companies which are already struggling to pay dividends  - and perhaps have a problem with surplus advance corporation tax too  - are unlikely to find investors receptive to being offered yet more shares which will add to the payout bill. The good news may be, though, that the corporate sector's need for new equity to repair tattered balance sheets is not as bad as might be expected, according to Mr Michael Hughes, head of Barclays de Zoete Wedd's economics and strategy department. He says that industrial and commercial companies' flow of funds which moved into deficit in 1986, and reached its worst point in 1990, has been improving as a result of earlier rights issues and efforts to conserve cash such as cost cutting. He is optimistic it could move into surplus in 1993. Average balance sheet gearing is a normal 25 per cent, he says, although income gearing has been more of a problem when interest rates were high and profits under pressure. But, Mr Hughes warns, the cost of equity capital is now high in spite of the level of the stock market. Dividends are paid out of after-tax profits, but debt is serviced from pre-tax profits. With the market yielding 4.3 per cent and base rates at 6 per cent there is not a lot to choose between debt and equity even on a short-term view. When future inflation is taken into account, equity issued now could turn out expensive. Companies could look for alternative sources of funds. They might lock into fixed-rate borrowings, or raise cash by making disposals. Some could follow Northern Foods, the dairy and foods group, into the convertible market. It obtained long-term debt at 6.75 per cent, which can convert into shares at an 18 per cent premium. There could also be a rash of so-called '5 per cent placings', the maximum allowed without formal clawback arrangements and done at much narrower discounts than rights issues.

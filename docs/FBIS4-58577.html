			<p>BFN     [Text] The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine  [PFLP] said that signing the Israel-PLO agreements in Cairo and  in Paris confirms Israel's success in circumventing the  implementation of resolutions of international legitimacy,  including UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. In a  press statement today, the PFLP's official spokesman said that  the signing of the agreements enables Israel to consecrate its  occupation and illegal measures such as building settlements,  confiscating territories, annexing and judaizing Jerusalem, and  continuing economic hegemony over the occupied territories.    The PFLP spokesman said that the front is not obligated by  the agreements reached and that it will continue to struggle  until the Palestinian people's objectives are achieved.    The Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP]  said that the Cairo agreement, which was signed today, brought  to light all the misleading, cheating, and false claims on the  nature of self rule in Gaza and Jericho. The DFLP explained  that withdrawal has been replaced by redeployment, noting that  the presence of settlements was legitimized by the fact that the  Oslo team recognized these settlements and agreed to have their  security protected by Palestinians.    In a statement distributed today, the DFLP said that the  agreement opens the door to normalizing Arab-Israeli relations  which threaten the fate of all Arab territories under occupation  and the future of the Palestinian people. The statement adds:  As the DFLP rejects the agreement and condemns those who signed  it, it announces that the agreement is not binding to the  Palestinian people and that it will continue its struggle to  achieve the Palestinian people's right to liberate their  territories from the occupation, to achieve self-determination,  and to establish their independent state.</p>

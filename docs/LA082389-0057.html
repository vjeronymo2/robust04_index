			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ELEVATOR FLUID SPEWS; CARRIER VISITORS PANIC  </P> <P> As many as 30 visitors aboard the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy were injured  Tuesday when a platform elevator's hydraulic line broke, spewing fluid and  causing panic among its passengers.  </P> <P> None of the injuries were serious, with most apparently being minor scrapes and  bruises, said Kristen Anderson, a spokeswoman for Port Everglades, where the  carrier was docked.  </P> <P> Lt. Paul Jenkins, a spokesman for the Navy in Norfolk, Va., said about 30  people were treated for injuries, including more than 20 who were treated by  paramedics at the scene and others who were sent to hospitals.  </P> <P> The elevator's hydraulic line burst shortly after 3 p.m., spraying visitors who  had come to see the world's largest steam-powered aircraft carrier, said  Anderson, adding that the fluid was not hot. The elevator, which is used to  carry aircraft from the hangar bay to the flight deck, was taking between 50  and 100 visitors from one deck of the ship to another.  </P> <P> The elevator did not stop or drop when the line burst, Jenkins said, and port  officials said panicked guests, rather than the broken fluid line, caused most  of the injuries.  </P></p>

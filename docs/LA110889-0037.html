			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE HIGH SCHOOLS;  </P> <P> NEWBURY PARK GEARS FOR RIVAL  </P> <P> Nearly a decade has passed since Newbury Park won a Marmonte League title. And,  even in 1981, the Panthers could not interrupt the aura of Thousand Oaks, the  neighborhood bully down the freeway.  </P> <P> In the final regular-season game that year, Newbury Park soundly defeated the  Lancers and for its effort shared the championship -- with Thousand Oaks. Since  then, Thousand Oaks has won or shared three more titles and is on the verge of  its fifth of the decade.  </P> <P> Newbury Park, in the meantime, made the playoffs in each of the first seven  years of the '80s before its recent dry spell of two seasons.  </P> <P> But there has been just one league championship.  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks and Newbury Park will meet again Thursday night with Marmonte  honors in the balance. The Lancers are 8-0-1, 5-0 in league play. Newbury Park  is 6-1-2, 4-0-1.  </P> <P> George Hurley, in his first year as Newbury Park head coach but his 18th as  part of the program, figures now is as good a time as any to shake up the  Lancers and shed Newbury Park's image as the "ugly stepsister."  </P> <P> "Our kids got kind of tired reading about how good their defense is," said  Hurley, who has a pretty good one himself. "(My players) want to prove there  are . . . other schools in this valley.  </P> <P> "And they deserve to play in this championship game."  </P> <P> Add Marmonte: Speaking of schools in the Conejo Valley, Newbury Park and  Thousand Oaks are joined by Westlake in the Division II playoffs -- the  Warriors' first playoff appearance since 1982.  </P> <P> First-year Coach Jim Benkert was able to rally the Warriors despite an 0-3  start in which the defense yielded 116 points. Westlake won three of its next  six games and tied another, primarily because the defense came together in a  7-3 league-opening win over Camarillo.  </P> <P> "I think that was the turning point," Benkert said. "I've been saying all along  that this is a playoff-caliber team. Now it's a sense of accomplishment."  </P> <P> The Wolves survive: Van Nuys has quietly slipped into prime playoff contention  in the Mid-Valley League with its 17-0 win over Birmingham on Friday. The  Wolves are alone in second place with a 3-2 conference record. The top two  teams are guaranteed playoff berths.  </P> <P> The 'X' factor in Van Nuys' season has been its defense: The Wolves have posted  three shutout in five conference games.  </P> <P> Coach Kenji Mochizuki credits lineman Jose Martinez and linebacker Edvin  Babayovo with anchoring the stalwart crew.  </P> <P> With a win over Monroe on Friday, Van Nuys will assure itself of postseason  action.  </P> <P> Forfeits: Hoover was forced to forfeit victories over South Pasadena and  Monrovia for allowing 14-year-old Chris Kalaleh to play. Southern Section rules  stipulate that a player must be 15 to play varsity football.  </P> <P> Kalaleh, a sophomore who turns 15 in December, caught 12 passes for 104 yards  in seven games.  </P> <P> Harvard's program: Scholastic Sports America, an ESPN program that focuses on  high school athletics, will be filming the Harvard water polo team's  first-round playoff match today against Newbury Park, Coach Rich Corso said.  </P> <P> Staff writers Tim Brown, Sam Farmer and Brian Murphy contributed to this  notebook.  </P></p>

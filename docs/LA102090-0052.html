			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATE VOTES 74-25 TO HALVE MILITARY AID TO EL SALVADOR;  </P> <P> CENTRAL AMERICA: THE LAWMAKERS RISK A VETO AS THEY CALL FOR POLITICAL AND HUMAN  RIGHTS REFORMS.  </P> <P> The Senate, in a sharp rebuke to the Bush Administration, voted overwhelmingly  Friday to withhold more than $40 million in military assistance from El  Salvador in an effort to press political and human rights reforms on its armed  forces.  </P> <P> Defying a White House veto threat, senators voted 74 to 25 to impose complex  restrictions on the $85 million in military aid earmarked for El Salvador next  year, withholding half for now and tying future assistance to the conduct of  both sides in El Salvador's bloody civil war.  </P> <P> The provisions were part of a $15.5-billion foreign aid bill on which the  Senate had hoped to complete action late Friday. It eventually postponed a  decision until Monday. Reflecting congressional concern about the Persian Gulf  crisis, the bill also would forgive $7 billion in Egyptian military debt and  cut off aid to countries that fail to comply with the global embargo against  Iraq. Egypt has sent troops to Saudi Arabia to support the U.S.-led deployment  against Iraq.  </P> <P> The Egyptian debt plan survived a spirited challenge, with critics arguing that  it sets a precedent the United States cannot afford at a time when lawmakers  must make deep cuts in domestic spending to reduce the budget deficit by $500  billion over five years.  </P> <P> The provision, which the Administration believes is vital to the stability of a  key U.S. ally in the Middle East, was retained when an attempt to strip it from  the bill was defeated by a 55-42 margin.  </P> <P> It was El Salvador, however, that dominated debate and clouded the future of  the bill, which President Bush has indicated he may veto unless the conditions  it places on Salvadoran military aid are modified. The House adopted similar  restrictions in the foreign aid bill it passed in June.  </P> <P> Reflecting congressional frustration with El Salvador's failure to solve the  brutal murders of six priests last year, the amendment sponsored by Sens.  Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) and Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) caps military aid to  El Salvador next year at $85 million.  </P> <P> Half of the $85 million would be withheld unless Bush determines that the  country's leftist rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front are  unwilling to accept a U.N. cease-fire plan or to cooperate with U.N. mediation  efforts, or if they launch another major military offensive. The full aid  package would be restored in any of those circumstances.  </P> <P> If, however, the government of President Alfredo Cristiani refuses to accept  the U.N. plan or fails to prosecute military officers believed responsible for  the slaying of the priests, the aid would be cut off completely.  </P> <P> While the Administration lobbied intensively to soften the restrictions,  several lawmakers said they do not believe that Bush will carry out his threat  to veto the foreign aid bill. They cited Bush's desire to win approval of the  Egyptian debt provision and the White House's recognition that, after a year of  prevarication and procrastination by officials investigating the Jesuit case,  congressional action was unavoidable.  </P> <P> The slaying of the Jesuits, followed by reports that Salvadoran military  officials were tampering with evidence and delaying the investigation,  mobilized a strong move in Congress to challenge the Administration's policies  on El Salvador. The prevailing mood was evident in the fact that 19 Republicans  joined with Democrats to vote for the Dodd-Leahy cuts.  </P> <P> "Year after year, the Administration has said it will cut military aid to El  Salvador if the (human rights) situation didn't improve . . . and year after  year, it doesn't improve. It gets worse," Leahy said in urging passage of the  restrictions.  </P> <P> "At a time when we are cutting virtually every program important to people in  the United States, we are sending money by the carload to El Salvador . . . and  that's not foreign policy, that's crazy," he added.  </P> <P> Recognizing that the effort to impose conditions on aid to El Salvador would  succeed, the Administration tried to soften them by supporting a Republican  amendment that would have restored the cuts unless both sides accepted a  cease-fire within 60 days.  </P> <P> Sen. Robert W. Kasten (R-Wis.), the ranking Republican on the foreign  operations subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee, argued that the  amendment would have given the Dodd-Leahy provisions "balance" by applying  pressure to reach peace "equally to both sides."  </P> <P> The Republican amendment was defeated 58 to 39, well short of the two-thirds  majority needed to override a veto.  </P></p>

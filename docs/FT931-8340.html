			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / International Company News: The slide from difficulty to disaster - The crisis that has engulfed SE Banken IT HAD been known for some time that Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken was in acute financial difficulty, but only yesterday did the full extent of the crisis become clear. The SKr5.3bn (Dollars 711.6m) loss for 1992 dwarfed anything that analysts had expected. The forecast of huge credit losses this year and next made the picture even bleaker. There was no surprise, therefore, that the government finally confirmed that the bank needed state support. The revelations do much to bear out the accuracy of a current Swedish joke, which suggests that the difference between a good bank and a bad bank in the country is about six months. For the speed at which the crisis has overtaken Sweden's most prestigious bank is stunning. A year ago, it made a SKr2.3bn profit. For the first four months of 1992 it recorded a SKr600m operating loss - its first deficit. After eight months, the loss had reached SKr2.6bn. But even this doubled in the final four months to reach yesterday's extraordinary total. That things deteriorated so quickly owes as much to the boom of the late 1980s as to the recession that followed. The collapse in property values has been the single most important factor in the weakening of the Swedish banking system, and SE Banken is paying a heavy price for its exposure to a small number of big clients in the real estate sector  - just 15 customers account for almost half of last year's SKr10.9bn lending losses. SE Banken's plight means that of the larger commercial banks, only Svenska Handelsbanken looks as if it has a realistic chance of surviving without state aid. The government has already put up SKr67.5bn to support three banks - Nordbanken, Gota Bank and Forsta Sparbanken - of which both Nordbanken and Gota Bank are under state control. Some analysts believe that only strong political objections will prevent SE Banken falling into state hands. 'The problems at SE Banken are similar to those at banks the government already owns. But the government doesn't want to own any more banks and there is value in having more than one privately-owned bank,' says one observer. How much money the state puts up, and how much capital SE Banken can attract through its own efforts, are the key questions. Conservative estimates suggest at least SKr10bn will be needed to recapitalise the bank, although some say the eventual figure will be much higher. The state expects SE Banken to do as much as possible to resolve its problems by raising new capital from private sources. But the bank is equally keen to know the extent of government aid before it goes ahead with any new share issue. A complex game is likely, in which each player tries to force the other to show his cards first. One possible outcome would be for the state to guarantee the assets in SE Banken's 'bad bank' - the special division set up last month to house non-performing loans - with additional share capital being raised from private sources to strengthen the bank's healthy activities. Some of the bank's shareholders, as the most notable casualties of the current crisis, may prove reluctant to provide more funds. Mr Bjorn Svedberg, SE Banken's chief executive, can play on the state's reluctance to take over the bank - but he can also count on the state driving a hard bargain as part of its determination to get a good deal for the taxpayer and to ensure competitive neutrality. That could entail the disposal of some of the bank's profitable activities. Many are waiting to see what role the Wallenberg family, Sweden's biggest corporate dynasty, might play in the outcome. The Wallenbergs' interests currently hold only 8 per cent of SE Banken's shares, but there has been speculation that this stake will increase as part of any reconstruction. However, this would almost certainly force the group to dispose of other shareholdings. There has also been speculation that the Wallenbergs might sell their voting rights to a 39.6 per cent holding in SKF, the world's biggest roller-bearing manufacturer. Last month SE Banken carried out a sweeping reorganisation, and it is likely that further moves will be made to cut costs further and to bolster the capital base. Such actions are likely to include staff cuts and disposals. But these efforts alone are unlikely to solve the bank's difficulties without a broader upturn in the Swedish economy. There have been some positive developments - including a recent fall in interest rates and the devaluation of the krona - but the economy is still heading for another difficult year. The finance department and the bank agree that Sweden's banking crisis will continue for at least another two years, with losses this year likely to equal those of last year. 'Most of the problems in the sector should have been dealt with by the end of next year,' Mr Bo Lundgren, the taxation minister, said yesterday. For the moment, that is as optimistic an assessment as can be found of the prospects for an end to Sweden's banking crisis.</p>

			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLORADO'S DRUG TESTING IS RULED UNCONSTITUTIONAL  </P> <P> A district court judge in Boulder, Colo., declared the University of Colorado's  athletic drug testing unconstitutional Tuesday and ordered the school to  discontinue the program, but a spokesman for the National Collegiate Athletic  Assn. said the decision will not affect its policy of testing athletes involved  in postseason play.  </P> <P> "They have their policy (at Colorado) and we have ours," said James Marchiony,  NCAA director of communications. "Their drug-testing policy has got nothing to  do with ours. The suit is against the University of Colorado, not the NCAA."  </P> <P> The NCAA requires member institutions to test athletes involved in postseason  competition. But many Division I schools have implemented testing in-season  programs of their own.  </P> <P> Tuesday's ruling by Judge Joseph Bellipanni was handed down in a lawsuit filed  by Dave Derdeyn, a former Colorado cross-country runner who maintained the  university's rapid-eye and random urine tests for drug use violated his  constitutional rights.  </P> <P> Athletic Director Bill Marolt and other university officials could not be  reached for comment.  </P> <P> James Joy, executive director of the Colorado chapter of the American Civil  Liberties Union, which filed the lawsuit for Derdeyn, agreed that the ruling  only affected the school, but added that should the decision be upheld on  appeal, it would become legal precedent.  </P> <P> "And I think every school in Colorado will see it as law, and that it can be  enforced as law," he said. "And if I were on a coaching staff, I'd be real  concerned about breaking that law.  </P> <P> "The NCAA can't enforce an illegal contract and that's what they have here.  These guys (athletes) are the healthiest and toughest people around and there's  no reason to believe they're taking drugs."  </P> <P> Drug testing began at Colorado with required and random urine tests in 1984.  The rapid-eye exams were instituted in 1986.  </P> <P> In his ruling, Bellipanni said urine testing is an intrusion and there is  "little doubt" that a random urine test should be considered a search under  constitutional law.  </P> <P> Rapid eye exams are not as intrusive, he said, but they are incorrect 97% to  98.5% of the time.  </P> <P> "Because of its disastrous ability to predict drug use, it functions more as an  avenue to inject arbitrary judgments into an otherwise random selection of  students for testing," he wrote.  </P> <P> "The court permanently enjoins the university from requiring any urine samples  from student athletes for the purposes of drug testing," the judge said. "The  university is further enjoined from requiring student athletes' participation  in the rapid eye exam procedure."  </P> <P> This is not the first time testing on the collegiate level has been challenged.  </P> <P> Last year a Superior Court judge in Santa Clara County ruled that Stanford's  administration of the NCAA's mandatory postseason test was an invasion of  privacy.  </P> <P> The case was brought to court by diver Simone Le Vant, who had refused to sign  a consent form that would have allowed the school to conduct the test. The  form, used since 1987, is considered a waiver of constitutional rights.  </P> <P> In that case, Judge Conrad Rushing said he would allow testing in football and  men's basketball because those two sports had accounted for all 34 -- of 3,511  athletes tested -- who had come up positive.  </P></p>

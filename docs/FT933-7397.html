			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: UK fund management Fund management groups should always outperform a rising equity market. With fees paid by institutions linked to the value of funds under management - and a high level of fixed costs - their earnings are geared to rising markets. It should come as no surprise, then, that Henderson Administration, Mercury Asset Management and M&amp;G have outperformed the market by 50 per cent since sterling left the ERM last September. With interest rates so low, the prospect of heavy unit trust sales as private investors shift savings out of deposit accounts has added spice to the cyclical recovery. Aggregate sales figures certainly support the notion that unit trusts are attracting retail money. The question is which of the fund managers will capture that business. M&amp;G's half year sales figures were mildly disappointing given its reputation. Perpetual, one of the minnows of the sector, has seen its market capitalisation increase fivefold over the last year thanks to its success in this area. The danger is that fund managers' gearing to the equity market also cuts both ways. The market capitalisation of Henderson fell by 70 per cent in the aftermath of the 1987 stock market crash. Private investors will not keep blind faith in unit trusts should the stock market suffer a serious setback. One can only hope that the very low yield on cash deposits means that the flow of retail money into equities is less speculative than six years ago.</p>

After the brother president and those attending had recited  Surah al-Fatihah [opening verses of the Koran] for the souls of  the innocent martyrs, brother President Abu 'Ammar gave an  address in which he stressed that the waterfall of Palestinian  blood would not halt for one moment until the Palestinian flag  and the flag of the Arab nation were raised over the walls,  minarets, and churches of Jerusalem.    Brother President Abu 'Ammar made a pledge to all the  martyrs  that the revolution, on whose long and difficult road they had  fallen, would continue, however great and long the sacrifices  and however much the difficulties increased, through the  determination and will of our people until victory and as far as  Jerusalem.</p>

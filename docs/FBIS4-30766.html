			<p>BFN     [Text] The Republic of Croatia has requested that the  situation in the occupied territories of the Republic of Croatia  be added to the agenda of the 49th session of the UN General  Assembly on 13 September. This was disclosed by the Croatian  permanent mission at the UN, which has submitted a formal  request to this effect to UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali. The text of the request stresses that the efforts  made by international mediators have so far produced no results  that could be described as significant progress in implementing  UN Security Council resolutions. By signing the Zagreb  agreement Croatia has shown its readiness to resolve the problem  of its occupied areas peacefully. But the Serb side -- by  refusing to resume the talks -- is showing that it is not  willing to accept the UN Security Council resolutions, while the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is continuing and speeding up the  silent integration of these areas into its state system, the  official request by the Croatian mission says.</p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Observer: Enemy rations Unilever employees are so fiercely loyal to their company's products that some even carry around packets of Flora margarine which they produce at outside business lunches. Imagine the scene then, when an FT colleague was invited to lunch yesterday with Mike Perry, Unilever's chairman-elect, in his private dining room and spotted on the table several pots of fruit yoghurt made by Muller, a German company unconnected with Unilever. Perry's consternation could hardly have been greater if a cockroach had crawled across his plate. An immediate investigation was ordered, which revealed that the catering department had decided to offer a wider range of fare at directors' lunches. Observer predicts that culinary experiments of this kind will not survive for long after Perry takes over the chair at Unilever today.</p>

			<p><P> March 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARCHBISHOP'S JET HELICOPTER  </P> <P> The expenditure of $395,000 to buy a jet helicopter for the personal use of  Archbishop Roger Mahony is sacrilegious, regardless of whether the money was  donated ("Gift of Helicopter Will Keep Archbishop Mahony Above the Fray,"  Metro, Feb. 26).  </P> <P> I am a Catholic who attends church weekly. In view of the fact that we are  asked almost every week to contribute to the needs of the church -- including  the missions, the poor, the homeless, the schools, the stewardship and the  Christmas decorating fund -- his actions are wasteful, to say the least.  </P> <P> Couldn't these funds be used in a more constructive and humane way?  </P> <P> I sympathize with the archbishop wanting to avoid traffic congestion. That's a  problem that all of his flock deal with daily. Is he above it?  </P> <P> The archbishop should keep his feet on the ground. If the hustle and bustle of  traffic are too nerve-wracking for him, I'm sure many parishioners would  volunteer to be his chauffeur.  </P> <P> JERRY GALANTE  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

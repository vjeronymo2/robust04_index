			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Dorling approaches stock market with doubled profits DORLING KINDERSLEY, the international publisher which plans to publish its pathfinder prospectus for a stock market listing next month, reported a doubling of annual pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.66m to Pounds 7.5m. Turnover grew by 66 per cent, from Pounds 42.8m to Pounds 70.9m, in the year to June 30, which the group said reflected strong performances by both its main businesses - adults' and children's illustrated ref-erence books. The proposed flotation, which should capitalise the company at between Pounds 75m and Pounds 100m, is expected to raise in the region of Pounds 30m, which the company plans to use to fuel its already rapid development. The share issue is being sponsored by Barclays de Zoete Wedd with Cazenove appointed as broker. The US is Dorling's biggest market, accounting for 32 per cent of turnover, compared with 30 per cent in the UK.</p>

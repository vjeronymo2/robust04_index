			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Books: Malcolm manipulated MALCOLM by Bruce Perry Station Hill Press, 542 pages THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MALCOLM X as told to Alex Haley Penguin Pounds 5.99, 512 pages BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY by Spike Lee Vintage Pounds 7.99, 314 pages MALCOLM X: THE GREAT PHOTOGRAPHS text by Thulani Davies Stewart, Tabori and Chang Pounds 14.99, 167 pages MALCOLM X, eternally a black hero, was the part-white child of an unhappy family whose inherent brutality denied him both security and self-respect. He became a teenage hustler, a scared kid, a swaggering thief who struggled to conquer his many fears. Imprisoned at the age of 20, he slowly improved himself. Motivated by an extraordinary effort of will, he became an autodidact, an ascetic, a campus debater and a popular philosopher. Released six-and-a-half years later, he devoted his considerable energy to the Nation of Islam, a black religious movement many of whose tenets were unrecognisable to true Islamic scholars. It was headed by the Reverend Elijah Muhammad, who quickly recognised the talents of his new recruit and made him his national representative. Malcolm soared above his origins to become one of the important political figures of his time. He proved to be the most effective minister the Rev Muhammad had ever recruited; even Cassius Clay, who came in much later as Muhammad Ali, could never replace Malcolm. The story ends as the final act in a familiar American tragedy. Rev Muhammad, like other founders of idiosyncratic American churches, turned out to be a disappointment: the philandering head of a wealthy clan whose income was the flow of cash from his followers. He fiercely defended his lucrative crown against what he perceived to be the threat of usurpation by Malcolm X. Yet it was Malcolm who achieved immortality by dying a martyr, assassinated in Harlem's Audubon Ballroom in February 1965. He was not yet 40. Bruce Perry's scholarly book seeks to demythologise Malcolm's autobiography. Its fascination lies in its analysis of the hero's early life, first as Malcolm Little, then as convict. It exposes his internal contradictions. To some of the observers quoted in its pages Malcolm X was so fair-skinned as to be almost mistaken for white, a proposition both supported and belied by photographs in Malcolm X: The Great Photographs. He made headlines by preaching for Rev Muhammad against 'white devils', yet eventually abandoned his racism and acknowledged that not all whites were evil. His autobiography depicts him as a family man; Perry piles on the evidence that suggests he was cold, often cruel, to women. It is not surprising that some of his posthumous admirers manipulate his memory in the interests of politically correct propaganda. I have not seen Spike Lee's film, but his book reproduces the screenplay by James Baldwin and others. This appears to ignore Perry's findings, perhaps in the interests of further mythologising the myth. It needs no such assistance. It is right to acknowledge his greatness, but not to deny the complexities and inner tensions that arise from his tortured character. His achievements are a matter of record, but so is his career as a political chameleon. During most of his publicly-witnessed lifetime Malcolm was known as a black nationalist, a preacher for black separatism, and an anti-white, sometimes anti-Semitic, rabble-rouser. In his later years, when he had abandoned much of this, he joked that his contribution to the civil rights movement was that he frightened the white establishment into accepting the integrationist demands of the Rev Martin Luther King Jr. Perry knows that history will be more appreciative than that. Malcolm X 'mobilized black America's dormant rage and put it to work politically', he writes. 'He made African-Americans feel proud of their color. In his effort to fashion a remedy for his self-hatred, he fashioned one for them.'</p>

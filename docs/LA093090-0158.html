			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAIRPLEX;  </P> <P> DACHI'S FOLLY WINS DERBY, SETS RECORD  </P> <P> Over an extremely fast track at Fairplex Park Saturday afternoon, Dachi's Folly  set a track record in beating favored Greydar by a neck to win the $104,300  Pomona Derby.  </P> <P> Rallying from seventh down the backstretch, Dachi's Folly moved between horses  on the far turn and caught Greydar in the final strides. Rocket Gibralter was  another neck behind in third. Due To The King, winner of the Foothill Stakes,  was rank throughout and faded to seventh.  </P> <P> Dachi's Folly covered 1 1/8 miles in 1:48 2/5 under Alex Solis, breaking  Epidaurus' record by one fifth of a second. Dachi's Folly paid $18.  </P> <P> "I was really surprised because he finished three lengths behind Greydar the  last time and really needed the race," Solis said. "He really kicked it in down  the stretch this time."  </P> <P> Greydar was four wide around the clubhouse turn and three wide into the  stretch.  </P> <P> In the 10th race, Monte Parnes set a track record of 1:41 3/5 for 1 1/16 miles,  paying $46 to win. Growler Sandue, a $25,000 claimer, equaled the 6 1/2-furlong  track record of 1:15 1/5 in winning the eighth.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fairplex Notes  </P> <P> Veteran thoroughbred trainer Richard Mulhall suffered a heart attack and was  admitted to Arcadia Methodist Hospital, according to Fairplex Park publicity  coordinator Don Escalante. Mulhall was in the coronary care unit Saturday  evening. Hospital spokesmen refused to release his condition. . . . No one had  six winners in the Pick Six. Today's carryover is $39,412. . . . Annual Date,  winner of the Pomona Derby last year, tops the field for this afternoon's  $150,000 Pomona Invitational Handicap.  </P> <P> Julio Garcia and Paul Atchison avoided injuries when unseated by their mounts  in the sixth and eighth races, respectively. Exclusive Emigrant broke down  entering the backstretch of the sixth race and Pirate's Adventure unseated  Atchison when caught in tight quarters around the clubhouse turn of the eighth  race.  </P></p>

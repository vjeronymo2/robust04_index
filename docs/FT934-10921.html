			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Individual ways to coin it: Rising costs are forcing changes in the financing of different welfare systems There is no single model of the welfare state in modern capital-ist econo-mies. Different structures reflect the differing circumstances under which countries created their welfare systems. It is not surprising, therefore, that the pressures straining welfare states across the world should manifest themselves in different ways. Each country faces its own particular problems in funding pensions, social security and health services. Yet in dealing with the pressures, countries with very different benefits systems are adopting similar solutions. There may be many more similarities between the welfare arrangements of countries in the future than there are now. Welfare states fall into three broad types, according to Professor Gosta Esping-Andersen, of the European university in Florence. He describes these as the conservative, liberal and social democratic models. The conservative model involves the sort of social insurance schemes found in countries such as Germany, France and Italy. They were introduced by governments such as Bismarck's in Germany in the 1880s, to reinforce society and family life against the disintegrative pressures of the market economy. Social insurance schemes focus mainly on employees, funding unemployment benefit, sick pay and pensions through employer and employee contributions. Strongly influenced by the social philosophy of the Catholic church, the conservative model emphasises the role of the family, with family benefits designed to encourage motherhood. Those outside the labour market, such as women caring for children, often had few individual welfare rights. The liberal model is based on the safety net approach to welfare, providing state benefits for those in real need. Common in Anglo-Saxon countries such as the US, Australia and New Zealand, liberal welfare states offer subsistence benefits only to those whose means fall below minimum levels. This reflects the belief of liberal economists that generous welfare benefits will interfere with the efficient working of labour markets. It also encourages the development of private welfare systems, with better-off individuals either negotiating welfare benefits at work, or buying them from insurance companies. The third model is the Scandinavian social democratic welfare state, in which all citizens have rights to benefits provided by the state out of taxation. Benefit levels are usually generous. They are often related to income, so that even middle-class professionals can rely on them. This type of welfare state is typically underpinned by some sort of employment guarantee, such as that, for example, which kept unemployment low in the Scandinavian countries until recent years. The architect of the social democratic model was Sir William Beveridge, whose 1942 report provided the blueprint for a 'cradle to grave' welfare state in the UK. This would not only redistribute income between those in need and the better-off. It would also act as a savings bank, with individuals paying in at times of prosperity and drawing out when sick, unemployed or retired. Yet shortage of funds is turning the UK social security system from a social democratic model to a liberal one. An increasing share of welfare support comes in the form of means-tested safety net benefits. These have been insufficient for the people on higher incomes to live off, encouraging private provision - particularly in pensions. All three models of welfare state have run into problems as their costs have climbed. The first to feel the heat was the liberal model. Although less generous than other types of welfare state, it is usually funded out of taxation. It has therefore been an early casualty of the tax revolt in which better-off voters have refused to support higher taxation to pay for the cost of a welfare state from which they increasingly opt out. Similar pressures have emerged in the social democratic welfare state, which places enormous burdens on public funds. Countries such as Sweden were initially able to fend off taxpayer revolts by generous provision for higher-income groups. But the cost pushed tax rates to unsustainable levels, leading to the election of governments committed to reducing welfare benefits. The conservative model is less susceptible to taxpayer pressure, since it is largely paid for by employee and employer contributions. However, employers have become concerned about the growing cost, which in Germany will next year reach almost 20 per cent of earnings for both employees and employers. Concerns over industrial competitiveness have forced such countries to launch reforms. Early responses to rising costs have reflected the particular characteristics of the three models. The liberal system has found it easiest to cut costs, through greater use of means-testing. Countries such as the UK, US and Australia have also tightened up the rules for claiming benefits, with longer waiting periods and closer scrutiny of claimants. Unemployed people face more rigorous requirements to retrain and seek work. With healthy private pension sectors, these countries have found it easier to increase private provision. Scaling down the demands of the social democratic welfare state has proved more difficult. There is opposition from the losers, who include many in the middle classes. Yet the level of benefits is being reduced in these countries, and waiting periods for claiming them lengthened. Increasingly, employers and employees are expected to make contributions to the cost of benefits, as in other welfare states. Countries such as France, Germany and Italy with conservative welfare systems have attempted to control costs by weakening the social insurance principle. Benefits are being reduced and no longer paid out as of right - the unemployed must actively seek work to qualify. Coverage has been extended to those not in employment. Some of the cost is being shifted from social insurance to general taxation. In the different types of welfare state, common themes are emerging as these reforms progress. One is a greater emphasis on ensuring that social security systems do not impede the reduction of unemployment. Lower benefits, requiring the unemployed to undergo training, and workfare-type policies involving work in return for benefits, are all designed to boost employment levels. Another is increasing pressure for people to make their own provision for welfare. It is still largely the Anglo-Saxon countries that offer incentives for private provision. But reductions in benefits in other countries will encourage individuals to do more to provide for themselves. So, too, will moves to restrict indexation of pensions to retail prices, which reduces pensions as a proportion of average earnings. A third theme is a widening of the funding base for public welfare schemes. Countries which relied on employer/ employee funding are shifting some of the burden to the government to control overall spending. Those that relied on taxpayers to fund welfare are asking employers and employees to pay more to reduce the fiscal pressures. It is too soon to say that the welfare states of the advanced economies are converging on a single model of provision. But most OECD countries are looking to a mixture of welfare funding that includes contributions from the state, employers and employees. Welfare benefits will be extended to all citizens, though perhaps at less generous levels than in the past. Across the advanced economies, individuals will increasingly have to complement public welfare provision with their own resources. This is the second article in a series on welfare states across the world. The first was published on October 25</p>

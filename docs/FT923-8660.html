			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / London homes boost expected THE NUMBER of homes to be provided by housing associations for London's growing population of homeless, needy, disadvantaged and disabled is expected to rise by a third in 1993-94, according to plans due to be announced today by the Housing Corporation. Increased spending by housing associations has provided one of the few bright spots in an otherwise depressed UK housing scene. During the three months to the end of April, associations in Britain started work on 7,600 homes - 55 per cent more than during the corresponding period last year. Grants to associations have risen sharply, as part of government plans for them to take over the local authorities' role as the main providers of social housing. There have been fears, however, that housing association budgets might be restricted as the government seeks to exert greater control over rising public expenditure generally. A great deal of attention, therefore, is expected to be paid to minimum spending targets for 1993-94 for London and the Home Counties. Those are due to be announced today by the Housing Corporation, which administers public-sector grants to housing associations. The corporation is expected to set a provisional target of 12,000 new homes for the region. That compares with a target of 9,000 in the current financial year. To cover the costs, the corporation is expected to announce that it will invest a minimum of Pounds 635m, of which Pounds 463m will be spent in the London boroughs. Housing associations will be expected to raise additional finance from private investors. About 20 per cent of the associations' funds in London and the Home Counties comes from private investors, mostly from building societies and the mortgage-lending arms of banks. The majority of the new homes will go to homeless families. About 12 per cent of funds will be set aside to support associations representing black and other ethnic minorities. Black families are four times as likely to be homeless as their white counterparts, according to the London boroughs. Funds will also be set aside to help the elderly and disabled, as well as for special schemes to assist people to buy their own homes under shared-ownership arrangements. The number of homes built by housing associations in Britain as a whole is expected to rise from 27,000 to more than 40,000 during the 12 months to the end of March next year. The estimated cost of the homes is Pounds 8bn, of which Pounds 1.5bn is expected to come from private investors.</p>

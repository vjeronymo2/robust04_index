			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Six are accused of pension fraud SIX men appeared at Birmingham Crown Court yesterday accused of conspiring to defraud the trustees and beneficiaries of the pension funds of Aveling Barford, an engineering company based in Grantham, Lincolnshire, which is now in liquidation. They were alleged to have removed Pounds 5m from the Pounds 9.4m fund by a deliberate fraud on the trustees, and to have used the money as capital for the company and as commissions and payments to individuals. The six defendants are Mr Robin Chapman, who was the company's solicitor; Mr Mathieu Einhorn, a pension fund trustee; Mr David Carter, a financial adviser and pensions expert; Mr Peter Murphy, a former executive director of the company; and Mr Graham Severn and Mr Harold Hobson, both former directors of Mildminster, an investment adviser. All six denied conspiring to defraud the trustees and beneficiaries of the hourly-paid employees' pension plan and the staff pension plan by failing to disclose to them the true nature and value of an investment. Mr Chapman and Mr Einhorn also deny conspiring to obtain Pounds 1m belonging to the trustees and beneficiaries by making false representations. Mr Severn and Mr Hobson also denied the theft of Pounds 880,252. Mr Richard Latham QC, prosecuting for the Serious Fraud Office, said the company had been sold by British Leyland to a company controlled by Dr Lee Kin Tat, a Singapore businessman, and Mr Adrian Eschallier, a US lawyer, in 1983. 'The central allegation is that from the end of 1983 Dr Lee, Mr Eschallier and other senior people both within and without the company had designs on the pension fund,' he said. It was seen as a source of capital for Aveling Barford and for personal commissions and payments to individuals, Mr Latham added. In 1986 Pounds 1m had been lent by the fund to the company by means of a fraud on the honest trustees, from whom material information had been deliberately witheld. In 1987-88 a further Pounds 4m had been dishonestly removed from the fund and 'reinvested' through Mildminster, Mr Latham said. The trial is expected to last four to five months.</p>

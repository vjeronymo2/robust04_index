			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Murray Ventures lags benchmark MURRAY VENTURES, an investment trust that aims to produce capital and income growth through investment primarily in medium-sized management buy-outs and capital financings, announced a total return on net assets of 26.7 per cent over the 12 months to July 31. The outcome compared with a total return for the FT-A All-Share Index of 32.3 per cent. Net asset value of this Murray Johnston-managed trust was 346.6p per share, a rise of 21 per cent over the year, again underperforming the FT-A All-Share index, which rose 26.7 per cent. Directors described the performance as 'creditable' given the delayed impact of recovery on smaller companies' trading. Unlisted investments realised during the year amounted to Pounds 12.8m, including the flotations of Yorkshire Food and Stagecoach. Investments totalled Pounds 2.9m and included Telephone Media and Poole Pottery. Available revenue amounted to Pounds 3.07m (Pounds 3.02m) for earnings of 12.4p (12.2p) per share. The proposed final dividend goes up to 7.5p bringing the total for the year to 10.9p (10.3p).</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 20 TASS -- Liquid radioactive waste  products of the "Zvezda" works in Primorye maritime region will  be dropped into the Pacific Ocean, unless urgent measures are  taken to collect, preserve and process them, the press centre of  the Russian Ministry for Emergencies announced on Thursday.    In expert opinion, the situation at the works is  controllable  so far, but in three months all the available tanks for  collecting the waste products will have been filled to capacity.    The Russian Government instructed the ministries and  departments concerned to suggest possible wayouts. The Ministry  for Emergencies, the Ministry for Nuclear Industry, the Ministry  of Public Health and naval forces proposed several ways to solve  the problem, but they cannot be realised for lack of funding.</p>

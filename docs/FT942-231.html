			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Gentle man in search of a tough job - Nancy Dunne interviews Rubens Ricupero, candidate to lead the World Trade Organisation Mr Rubens Ricupero looks more like a friar than a finance minister - particularly Brazil's finance minister on the eve of a potentially painful currency conversion. A fringe of white hair springs from his bald pate. His demeanour is gentle. But the job he wants is one of the most formidable in the diplomatic world: the director-generalship of the still-to-be-launched and not-yet-defined World Trade Organisation, successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Mr Ricupero first has an obstacle to overcome in his own hemisphere - the now formalised candidacy of Mexican President Carlos Salinas. The Brazilian has only complimentary things to say about Mr Salinas and stresses that his own candidacy is based on 'different criteria' - an intimate, detailed knowledge of world trading rules. 'I know the traditions, the history, the people. I could go to work there tomorrow,' he said. Mr Ricupero has been finance minister since April, after holding a succession of increasingly visible diplomatic and political posts. He was ambassador to Gatt (1987-1991), ambassador to the US (1991-1993), and environment minister (1993). During his time at Gatt he served as chairman of the Informal Group of Developing Countries, the Committee on Trade and Development, the Gatt Council and the Gatt Contracting Parties. His candidacy springs from Geneva (where the Gatt secretariat is based), rather than Brasilia, said one of his aides. 'He was asked to run; he did not seek this and there are many other things he can do.' Mr Ricupero's tact on the subject of Mr Salinas is remarkable considering what Brazilians regard as unsportsmanlike behaviour on behalf of the Mexican president at the Ibero-American summit in Cartagena, Colombia, two weeks ago. It was only after the Brazilians left early on hearing of the death of their president's nephew that Mr Salinas' supporters moved and won an unofficial endorsement of the Mexican president's candidature, the Brazilians say. It caused a diplomatic incident with Argentina which has now backtracked and supports Mr Ricupero. Mr Ricupero's best shot could be as a compromise candidate from the developing countries in the case of a stand-off between Mr Renato Ruggiero of Italy, as the EU's candidate, and Mr Salinas, who may be regarded by some as too close to the US. Mr Ricupero's supporters have a long list of points in his favour: Brazil's economy comprises 40 per cent of Latin America's gross domestic product; Brazil was a founding member of the Gatt, which Mexico joined just eight years ago; Mexico's trade is heavily dependent on the US while Brazil's is truly multilateral - about 20 per cent of its trade is with Asia, 22 per cent with the US, 30 per cent with Europe and 20 per cent with Latin America. Mr Ricupero's staff call him a 'Renaissance man', equally comfortable discussing music, the arts, philosophy and religion. He still teaches two courses at the University of Brasilia, where he started teaching in 1987 and was appointed professor. There is the air of the pedagogue about him as he dissects the pros and cons of trading blocs and concludes that they are 'building blocks' of liberalisation in which trading partners can more easily make concessions. 'One of the aspirations of Brazil is to advance towards a South American common market,' he said. Eventually the hemisphere would unite under the banner of freer trade. He sees little threat of a return to the protectionism of the 1930s. There is no depression or scarcity of strong currencies to drive it, he said. Instead of deepening political divisions - as between the fascists, communists and democrats in the 1930s - there is now 'systemic convergence'. He said the WTO, which still 'has only a paper existence', must be given form and substance based on the rules agreed in Marrakesh. These rules must be tested, he said. He has definite ideas about what the WTO should not be - centralised, like the other Bretton Woods institutions, a large bureaucracy, or ideological. It must be more open to outsiders; special meetings could be called to give access to non-governmental organisations. As for the controversy over bringing workers' rights into the WTO, he called for a 'step-by-step approach for confidence-building' among the warring parties. Polarisation between north and south must be avoided. The issues must be clarified by debate. 'There is a tremendous amount of distrust,' he said. 'We must avoid being bogged down.'</p>

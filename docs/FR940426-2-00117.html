A Category A fund is any pension fund that identifies and documents in its application the presence of a pipeline of projects for which project-specific proposals sufficient to use the total amount of the set-aside requested by it can be submitted to HUD within 120 days after HUD selects the fund for participation in the demonstration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A Category B fund is any pension fund that does not make such identifications or documentations.

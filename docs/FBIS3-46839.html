Due to a conflict  between the ruling and opposition parties over political reform,  Prime Minister Hosokawa and Foreign Minister Hata were forced to  cancel planned trips; Hosokawa was scheduled to visit Britain in  January and Hata was planning to make a round of calls to the  Middle East and Europe. In particular, relations between Japan  and the United States are in a serious condition. Some people  doubt that the prime minister will be able to announce at  Japan-U.S. summit talks, slated for February, effective  pump-priming economic measures in line with Japan's pledge to  the United States to reduce Japan's trade surplus. It is  pointed out that, if not properly handled, the relations between  the two countries "may become worse than before," (according to  a senior Foreign Ministry official).    The New York summit held in September, where Prime Minister  Hosokawa and President Clinton met with each other for the first  time, was a venue for the "reformist leaders" to confirm their  solidarity. Expecting that the prime minister might launch  policies beneficial to the United States, the United States so  far has maintained a stance of watching the "administration for  political reform" in a relatively warm manner.    It can be said that the next summit will be their first  actual chance to mutually examine progress of the new Japan-U.S.  economic talks. The Japanese Government plans to reject U.S.  demands to set numerical targets in individual fields. However,  the government understands that it is macroeconomically  necessary to show some degree of a positive stance toward U.S.  demands for expansion of Japan's domestic demands and to reduce  the trade surplus.    However, the Hosokawa administration had no choice but to  give up compilation of the 1994 budget, which was much desired  for stimulating the economy, before the end of 1993 and to delay  making a decision on income tax reduction until the next year  [1994]. Moreover, mid-January of next year -- when the  government plans to launch economic measures -- is indeed the  time when deliberation on political reform will reach its final  stage. We can make no guess about whether or not the government  will be able to sufficiently deal with the political situation  when it gets confused. This is why the United States, which so  far has ventured to pretend as if it were in a "Japan-U.S.  honeymoon period," feels uneasy about Japan's political  situation.    On the other hand, due to the substantial extension of the  current Diet session, it became impossible for the prime  minister to make his planned round of calls to Italy, Germany,  and France. The foreign minister also had to call off a series  of planned trips abroad. Various diplomatic obstacles are being  felt now. But, it is obvious that the Hosokawa administration  will immediately fall into a crisis of administrative collapse  should it fail to deal with top priority issues needed for  political reform. Feeling such a dilemma, a senior Foreign  Ministry official said in a self-scorning tone that "the Tokyo  summit was held after the Diet was dissolved."</p>

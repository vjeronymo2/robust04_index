			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Ceasefire survives as US plane attacks Iraq battery THE ceasefire ordered by President Saddam Hussein appeared still to be intact yesterday, despite another clash between US aircraft and Iraqi ground forces. The US Defence Department said its aircraft had fired at and missed an Iraqi SAM-3 missile battery that had switched on its target tracking radar, but they did not know if the activation of the radar was a deliberate challenge by Iraq or if an individual anti-aircraft battery had not received the ceasefire order. However, Iraq said it had no missiles in the area, and called the US missile firing a provocation. Orders issued to US, French and British aircraft patrolling the two air exclusion zones in northern and southern Iraq have not changed since the new US administration of President Bill Clinton took office on Wednesday. Pilots may fire to protect themselves in the event of any hostile or threat ening action by Iraqi aircraft or ground defences. Threatening action certainly includes 'lock-on' by fire control radar attached to anti-air craft missile batteries. Pentagon officials say a pilot on the receiving end of these high frequency radars generally knows he is seconds away from being a missile target. It is less clear whether coalition aircraft are also authorised to fire when they are 'painted' or 'illuminated' by search radar, which operate at much lower frequencies. US aircraft on Thursday attacked a radar which had merely illuminated them, but immediately before the radar was switched on they had come under anti-aircraft artillery fire. A White House spokesman said yesterday that Mr Clinton was 'prepared to hold firm with Iraq'. 'If the Iraqis take hostile action against the American pilots, they will respond.' James Whittington in Baghdad adds: All heads of diplomatic missions in Baghdad were yesterday summoned to the Iraqi Foreign Office and told Mr Mohammed Sa'id Kazin al Sahhaf, that Iraq intends to stick to its ceasefire.</p>

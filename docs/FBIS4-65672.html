			<p>BFN     [Text] Oxford (DPA) -- According to Defense Minister Volker  Ruehe, Russia is entitled to play a certain special role in  security partnership with NATO, but it should not make  exaggerated demands. In a speech at St. Antony's College of  Oxford University on 19 May, Ruehe said according to the draft  text that Russia should not be treated like Tajikistan or  Albania. "However, it must learn to see itself as Russia, as  neighbor among neighbors, and as a partner among basically  equals, and act accordingly." He said it was understandable  that Russia as a big power wanted to play a part in pan-European  security issues. Moscow should become a strategic partner of  NATO, but "must not hinder our neighbors' step-by-step  integration into Western structures."</p>

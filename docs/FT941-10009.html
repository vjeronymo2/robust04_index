			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Opening Tuzla airport is vital Sir, I have just returned from Tuzla in central Bosnia where I work for Oxfam, and I was struck by the force of your editorial, 'Something must be done' (February 7). You are right, I believe, to pinpoint the reopening of Tuzla airport as the most important action that the UN could take at this time. If decisive action is not taken to defend civilians in all of the safe areas (including Sarajevo and Tuzla) and to ensure relief supplies get through, then the relief effort will collapse. At present the greatest danger to aid workers is from angry and frustrated civilians who perceive that the UN is weak, ineffective or biased. It is time governments made plain that the UN can be strong, effective and impartial in its delivery of humanitarian relief. The plight of civilians in Tuzla is severe. Although it is nominally a 'safe area', an effective blockade allows only 20 per cent of food needs to be provided. A single egg costs Pounds 1. As in Sarajevo, sporadic shelling is a tactic designed to catch people unawares and in the open and therefore cause maximum civilian casualties. Not only will reopening Tuzla airport relieve immediate suffering, but it would also help restore the battered reputation of the UN throughout former Yugoslavia. The UN should immediately announce that, by a set date, Tuzla airport must be opened to relief flights. The UN must state that that objective and deadline are non-negotiable. What can be negotiated are measures to ensure that all parties can be satisfied that only relief supplies will be flown in. Once the deadline is passed, General Sir Michael Rose must, as your editorial makes plain, reopen the airport and be able to call on close air support from Nato to defend aid flights.

			<p>BFN     [Text] SYDNEY, June 26 (AFP) -- Canberra still has no  intention of hiking official interest rates, although more banks  are expected to increase housing loan rates amid expected  further bond market chaos this week, Treasurer Ralph Willis said  Sunday.    In a strong defence of his government's policy on interest  rates, Willis said it would increase rates only when it saw the  need, "which is when we see inflationary pressures emerging."    "We don't see that at the present time," he said in a  television interview.    Willis expected other banks to follow the lead of the  Advance  Bank and Citibank, which announced late Friday they were  immediately raising fixed-term home loan rates for new customers  by 0.5 percent.    He said he also expected another sell-off on bond markets  here Monday following upheaval on US markets Friday when the US  Federal Reserve spent three billion US dollars in a failed bid  to prop up a collapsing US dollar.    The sell-off here last week had been driven largely by  events  overseas, particularly in the United States, and he expected  what he described as "the herd mentality" to continue here  Monday.    "Now that's not reflecting any view of the bond dealers or  the fund managers about the inflationary situation in  Australia," the treasurer added.    "It is reflecting quite clearly a view about what might  happen to prices of bonds and trying to move to ensure that they  are not left behind if prices fall further."    The financial markets, he said, had "enormous influence,"  the  consequences of which Australia had to bear in a deregulated  market.    "But that does not mean to say that we are necessarily  forced  then into a position of raising official rates."    It was important to the future of the Australian economy  that  the government was not pushed into increasing interest rates too  soon, he added.    "If we wait too long then we will probably have to have a  larger increase than would otherwise be the case if we moved  earlier," he said.    "But we don't want to move too early either because it's  just  pointless doing that when there are no inflationary pressures  there to offset," he added.    Asked about a predicted "tidal wave" of interest rates  increases as early as Monday, Willis said while it was hoped  there would not be a tidal wave, other banks might follow the  lead and raise their fixed term rates.    But the rates, which had been increased already, were fixed  rate mortgages which he said were a very small part of the  overall mortgage market and the banks had raised them to cover  the increased cost of borrowed funds.    He said people should not pay too much attention to reports  that housing loan rates could increase by two percent in 12  months, but agreed there would be some upward movement in rates.    "We have been quite forthcoming about that, we have never  denied that," he said. "It would be stupid of us to do so  because monetary policy is an important arm of the government's  policy for controlling inflation.    "Over the course of a cycle as inflationary conditions  develop you have to use monetary and fiscal policy to keep those  inflationary pressures at bay," he said.    But he described this as "a small price to pay" for  continued  economic recovery which would not be stymied by high inflation.</p>

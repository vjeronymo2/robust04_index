He added in an exclusive interview with AL-WATAN:  Our main objective is to entrench the concept of conscription,  which has become a tangible reality. He further said that these  endeavors are aimed at making use of the conscripts' skills and  transferring these conscripts to the units best suited to their  qualifications and expertise.    In reply to a question, Col. Sumayt denied the existence of  favoritism or distinction between conscripts, and indicated that  rumors in this respect are untrue and unrealistic.    Col. Sumayt also touched on the issue of sanctions and said:  "The Conscription Law has given many rights to the conscript,  and has provided for some sanctions ranging from added time to  fines and imprisonment." He added: "If the person subject to  military duty fails to present himself, six months will be added  to the period of his conscription. The additional period would  be reduced to two months if the person joined the army within 15  days after the deadline. The person would be referred to a  court to stand trial in accordance with Article 29 of the law,  which provides for jail sentences or fines if he fails to  present himself for a second time."    In conclusion, Col. Sumayt said: "If the person subject to  military duty fails to present himself after the legal age of  conscription, which is 30 years, he will be referred to a court  to stand trial in accordance with the provisions of Article 30.  He could then receive a maximum jail sentence of three years or  be asked to pay a maximum fine of 1,500 Kuwaiti dinars."</p>

			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Targeting the Asian market for marine seals  -The rationale behind TI's purchase of a majority stake in Dover Japan TI GROUP'S contested Pounds 510m takeover of Dowty last year has inevitably focused City attention on the enlarged engineering group's aerospace ambitions. In a quieter way, though, it is also making waves at sea. Over the past two years TI's John Crane International seals business has developed a world-leading presence in a range of seals and bearings for hulls and propulsion systems. Behind the recent formation of John Crane Marine International to handle the marine side of the business lies one of the few purchases by a UK group of a majority stake in a publicly quoted Japanese company. The acquisition will help John Crane exploit Asian markets for marine seals. Its Deep Sea Seals business had grown consistently in sales and profits for several years but its mechanical-type seals had been focused mainly on naval markets. These are a higher value product than the 'radial lip seals', made of synthetic rubber, used in commercial shipping. But, says Mr Bob Fisher, chief executive of John Crane, there are probably 80,000 commercial ships afloat, compared with 8,000 naval ships of different types. And to be strong in commercial shipbuilding markets, 'we needed to be in Asia - probably 60 per cent of all commercial shipbuilding is in Asia, with Japan first, then Korea, China and Taiwan'. Developing a strong commercial presence from scratch would have taken years. There were only three main producers, Blohm + Voss in Germany, Kobelco - part of Japan's Kobe Steel - and Dover Japan, a company 50.14 per cent owned by Dover Corporation of the US. As a producer that was independent of steelworks and shipyards, Dover Japan seemed the best bet. But it was a small Japanese company with banks, insurance companies and institutions among its investors, and the acquisition needed careful handling. In June 1991, however, a deal was concluded, with TI paying Y5.7bn (then Pounds 25m) for Dover's stake. It paid a further Dollars 34m (Pounds 21m) for Dover's complementary US and European marine seals activities. That year, Mr Fisher joined John Crane after five years living and working in Japan, an experience, he says, that was to prove useful in understanding Dover Japan's mentality. 'There are more vestiges of the past when you buy a small Japanese company. We had to be sensitive to the Japanese ways of doing business, and make the Japanese management comfortable that things would work out,' he says. Dover Japan was quickly introduced to TI's financial and reporting system. In the UK, finance directors are much more involved in the business and work more as a guide to operating division heads, while their counterparts in Japan concentrate on statutory reports, says Mr Fisher. 'That's a tremendous change, and it took several months to be put in place,' he adds. TI has since increased its stake in Dover Japan to 55 per cent, but it remains publicly quoted. In renaming it Japan Marine Technologies in January, 'we wanted to be sure it was clearly recognised as a Japanese company', says Mr Fisher. At the same time, though, the Japanese company has become an important element in the overall strategy at John Crane Marine International. The acquisition of manufacturing capability for commercial seals in Asia, along with sales and service capability in the US and western Europe, has given the unit a 2-to-1 loading in favour of commercial seals. Tighter environmental and pollution regulations from 1995 will drive market growth in new commercial shipbuilding, Mr Fisher says, while the service and repair business will also play a stronger role. 'Because of pollution penalties, and to preserve their reputations, ship operators will want upgraded products,' he says. By bringing all types of marine seals into one organisation, the unit can offer 'one-stop shopping' for ship operators and encourage the shift away from the traditional packed glands. These have been used as a cheaper, but leakier, alternative to mechanical seals in markets where environmental correctness holds less sway. But naval markets are not being ignored. The Japanese navy is larger than the UK's, says Mr Fisher, but is not among the 51 navies using John Crane seals. Owning a Japanese company could help it gain access, although it will take a while, he says. There is also a big opportunity to supply both commercial and naval fleets in eastern Europe. Until recently, he says, it was very difficult to understand who was making and supplying their seals. TI does not publish profits for the marine seals division, but Mr Fisher says the acquisitions and reorganisation have added to the group's profits. The Japanese deal has had other effects too. TI has wanted for years to increase its Asian presence - Asia and Latin America collectively account for about 10 per cent of group turnover. John Crane itself has had a Japanese joint venture for 25 years, but the purchase of JMT has helped focus the group's attention on the region, says Mr Fisher. 'At chairman's policy committee, and at strategy and board meetings, there is much more of an emphasis on Asia than there had been before,' he says. 'That is an important change for all of TI.'</p>

This is the second round of talks in the U.S.  capital after U.S. President Bill Clinton's meeting with his  Syrian counterpart, Hafiz al-Asad.    These two rounds of talks are significantly different from  the discussions during the past 11 rounds because of the  semiopen nature that has been granted to these two rounds of  talks. A State Department spokesman has also described the  Arab-Israeli talks as unofficial. This shows that the nature of  the current talks is actually midway between Israel's persistent  call for unofficial and closed talks with Syria and Syria's  insistence on official and open talks within the framework of  international regulations. Israel is seeking to repeat the  experience of the secret PLO-Israeli talks with Syria as well.  However, Damascus, which has strongly criticized this behavior  by the PLO and Israel, does not want to give in.    The second round of the semiovert talks in Washington has  started away from the limelight at a time when a suitable  political atmosphere for compromise is not discernible. Syria,  which had described the signing of the Gaza-Jericho self-rule  accord in Washington between 'Arafat and Tel Aviv as a blow to  the Middle East peace process, has described the recent  PLO-Israeli agreement as a new tragedy. Damascus has also  stated in advance that any expectation for progress in the  current talks is useless. The Zionist regime too has called for  a postponement of the talks or raising the level of the talks.    Shim'on Peres, foreign minister of the occupying regime, has  called for a meeting between the heads of Tel Aviv and Damascus.  But Syria's political officials say that with this request,  Israel is trying to escape from the content of the talks and to  stick only to the form of the talks.    The Washington talks concerning Jordan and Palestine are at  a  standstill because of the signing of agreements, while the parts  concerning Syria and Lebanon do not present a very hopeful  outlook because of Israel's stances, especially when the  experience of the PLO-Israeli accord has not been able to gain  much popularity either.</p>

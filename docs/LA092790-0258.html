			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ART MUSEUM JUDGE ASSAILS JURY PROGRESS;  </P> <P> OBSCENITY: JURIST TELLS HIS ANNOYANCE OVER SLOW PACE OF SELECTION IN  MAPPLETHORPE CASE.  </P> <P> A county judge said he will take over questioning of potential jurors today if  lawyers in the nation's first obscenity trial of a museum and its director fail  to make a more serious effort to seat a jury.  </P> <P> "I'm going to have to do something to move this along," Hamilton County Judge  David Albanese said.  </P> <P> He had said Wednesday that the court will remain in session as long as  necessary today to get a jury seated.  </P> <P> The Contemporary Arts Center and its director, Dennis Barrie, face misdemeanor  charges of pandering obscenity and displaying nude photos of children in an  exhibit of photographer Robert Mapplethorpe.  </P> <P> By Wednesday, lawyers had rejected eight prospective jurors and tentatively  seated seven.  </P> <P> Albanese warned attorneys to limit their questions to those that would  determine whether a juror could be fair and impartial.  </P> <P> "They're not going to be educated in the law or indoctrinated into cases of the  state or defense," the judge said.  </P> <P> While defense lawyers had sought to expose bias toward homosexuals, potential  jurors must distinguish between art and obscenity in weighing the charges over  seven of the 175 photos from the exhibit.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, the defense persuaded the judge to remove two prospective jurors  who admitted they were prejudiced against homosexuals.  </P> <P> Marc Mezibov, the gallery's lawyer, asked one potential juror, "Was that a  strike against the Contemporary Arts Center to know it was exhibiting works of  a homosexual?"  </P> <P> She replied that it was not.  </P></p>

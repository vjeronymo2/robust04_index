			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Chubb faces strike threat over wage freeze CHUBB GROUP could face strike action over its attempt to impose a six month wage freeze on the 530 workers in the lock, key and safe manufacturing parts of the company. The union which represents the workers believes that in the course of the demerger with Racal Electronics the Chubb directors have placed the company's image with City investors above fair treatment of employees. Mr Michael Bradley, leader of the National Union of Lock and Metal Workers, said that Chubb was expecting a 35 per cent increase in profits to Pounds 28m in the seven months to October 9 and yet had imposed a pay freeze in August. 'We weren't happy about the pay freeze in the light of those profits. We think it's political. They are just doing it to impress the City with how tough they are,' said Mr Bradley. After talks with the union the company agreed to pay a 4.5 per cent increase from February next year, which would be the equivalent of an annualised increase of 2.25 per cent. But that was rejected by the union which then balloted its members on strike action. A total of 499 workers out of 530 voted for strike action. Mr Bradley said that he believed a similar wage freeze had been imposed on employees in other Chubb companies and that so far it had been accepted.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed in finding No. III.3., Colorado's first proposed exception, concerning underground mining operations that contain a highwall or face-up area that was in place prior to August 3, 1977, has no direct Federal counterpart and is not inconsistent with the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 817.106(a), (b), and (b)(1) or any other requirements of the Federal regulations or SMCRA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed in finding No. III. 4., Colorado's second proposed exception, concerning remining operations, is no less effective than the counterpart Federal exceptions at 30 CFR 816.102(a)(2) and 30 CFR 817.102(a)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the proposed revision would provide for exceptions to the requirements to eliminate all highwalls that have been determined to be no less effective than the corresponding Federal regulations, the Director approves the proposed revision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Rules 4.14.2(1), 4.14.2(1)(b), and 4.27.4(1) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Colorado proposed to revise Rule 4.14.2(1) to allow modification of the slope grading requirements at Rule 4.14.2 by referencing existing exceptions to the backfilling and grading requirements at Rule 4.27, regarding performance standards for variances from AOC restoration requirements for steep-slope mining, and Rule 4.14.1(2)(e), regarding variances for excess spoil at underground mining operations from AOC requirements if the spoil is not needed to eliminate highwalls and depressions. In addition, Colorado referenced proposed exceptions to the backfilling and grading requirements at Rule 4.14.1(2)(f), regarding the exception for complete elimination of certain highwalls at underground mining operations, and Rule 4.14.1(2)(g), regarding the exception for complete highwall elimination for remining of sites mined and abandoned prior to August 3, 1977. In doing so, Colorado proposed to delete ambiguous language allowing for modification of the slope grading requirements for lands that had not been restored in accordance with Colorado's program and where insufficient spoil was available to otherwise comply with Rule 4.14. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Colorado proposed to revise Rule 4.14.2(1)(b) to incorporate exceptions to the requirement for complete elimination of highwalls by referencing proposed Rules 4.14.1(2) (f) and (g). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Colorado proposed to revise Rule 4.27.4(1), regarding variances from the requirements to meet AOC for steep-slope mining operations, and to incorporate a reference to the proposed highwall elimination variance provisions as set forth in proposed Rules 4.14.1(2)(f) for underground mining operations and Rule 4.14.1(2)(g) for remining operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For all of these rules proposed by Colorado, the corresponding Federal regulations are found at 30 CFR 816.102(a) (1) and (2) and 817.102(a) (1) and (2). These Federal regulations require that disturbed areas be backfilled and graded to achieve AOC, except as provided at 30 CFR 816.102(k) and 817.102(k), concerning variances from AOC for postmining slopes, and that all highwalls, spoil piles, and depressions be eliminated, except as provided at 30 CFR 816.102(h) and (k)(3)(iii) and 817.102(h) and (k)(3)(iii), concerning small depressions and previously mined areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since Colorado's proposed revisions to Rules 4.14.2(1) and (1)(b) and 4.27.4(1) would simply provide for appropriate references in these rules to other Colorado rules that OSM has previously approved or is approving in this notice, the Director finds that the proposed revisions are no less effective than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.102(a) (1) and (2) and 817.102(a) (1) and (2) that identify, by reference to other Federal regulations, the exceptions to the requirements for AOC and complete elimination of depressions, spoil piles, and highwalls. Therefore, the Director approves Colorado proposed Rules 4.14.2(1) and (1)(b), and 4.27.4(1). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Colonel-General Grigoriy Bessmertniy, the chief of  staff of the joint peacekeeping forces in Tajikistan, told  INTERFAX that the opposition was stepping up its activity on the  Tajik-Afghan border. Military experts estimate that about 8,000  militants have been concentrated along the Tajik-Afghan border,  he said.    The situation is particularly tense in the Pyanj section,  where militants attempt to cross the border and bring weapons to  Tajikistan.    The opposition formations are equipped with automatic  rifles,  Stinger missiles, grenade launchers, recoilless rifles and  self-made rocket launchers, and are much better trained than the  Tajik forces.    Despite this, the Tajik opposition will not be able to break  the defense line and penetrate into Tajikistan, said  Bessmertniy. Tajikistan is strong enough to prevent civil war,  he added.    Speaking about the role of the peacekeeping forces, he said  that fighting against the Islamic opposition was not their goal.  "Our goal is to prevent armed conflicts and help border guards,"  said Bessmertniy.</p>

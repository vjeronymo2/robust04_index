			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Emerging Markets: News round-up - Israel First International Bank of Israel has introduced an instrument that will allow domestic investors to invest in the dollar-shekel continuous foreign exchange market, agencies report. Under current law, only importers, exporters, banks and foreigners can buy foreign currency in Israel for investment. The instrument was made possible by the liberalisation of the country's currency markets on July 4, when the government introduced a continuous trading system. This system now accounts for 68 per cent of Israel's forex trading. Edited by John Pitt. Further coverage of emerging markets appears daily on the World Stock Markets page</p>

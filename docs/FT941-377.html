			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: TransTec advances to Pounds 11m TransTec, formerly known as Transfer Technology, pushed up pre-tax profits by 19 per cent last year, helped by acquisitions but hindered by difficult trading in the automotive sector. The specialist engineering group yesterday announced that pre-tax profits in the 12 months to end-December were Pounds 11.2m, compared with Pounds 9.45m in 1992. This produced earnings per share of 8.9p against 8.6p, a figure adjusted for last October's 5-for-1 subdivision of the shares. During the current year, Mr Geoffrey Robinson, chairman, expects 'continuing progress'. For a group which exports 75 per cent of its production, the main growth will be in the US and, to a lesser extent, east Asia, but European markets seem likely to remain subdued. 'We remain cautious about any significant improvement over 1993,' Mr Robinson said of the automotive market. Last year TransTec suffered from the downturn of the European car market, and the contribution of the group's automotive division to operating profits fell from Pounds 3.83m to Pounds 2.53m. Margins, both in this division and in the inspection systems division, were under severe pressure. By contrast the control and manufacturing technology division, enlarged by two newly-acquired companies, pushed up operating profits from Pounds 5.33m to Pounds 8.28m. Total operating profits were Pounds 12.3m, against Pounds 10.3m in 1992. Turnover rose by Pounds 38.5m to Pounds 145m, with Pounds 32.3m of the increase coming from new acquisitions - the two companies of the control and manufacturing division, and one in the automotive division. The final dividend is 2p, making 3.3p (3.2p) for the year. This is covered 2.7 times by earnings of 8.9p, the same as last time.</p>

			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / The view from six capitals ITALY Membership of the narrow band of the exchange rate mechanism since 1990 has been uncontested in Italy and has been the country's sole consistent aspect of economic policy. The new Amato government would be most reluctant to consider realignment until assured of backing from the main political parties for its new emergency budget and until after 1993 budget outlines have been prepared. FRANCE Government would fiercely resist realignment which revalued D-Mark, having fought over past decade to hold policy of monetary and budgetary rigour. Inflation has stayed below German levels for past 13 months, and France feels well on way to earning as much credibility as Germany in the debate on Europe's monetary future. It has no interest in surrendering these gains, least of all when there is no economic need. GERMANY Preoccupations, manifested by actions of Bundesbank, have a twin focus: D-Mark's role as guarantor of German economic wellbeing, and currency's anchor function in EMS. Argument runs that, if D-Mark unstable then so is EMS. Bank says recent discount rate rise intended to stabilise monetary growth while causing as little upset as possible. Officials imply what others do is up to them, offering no judgment whether realignment necessary or desirable. PORTUGAL Having only recently joined the exchange rate mechanism to promote its programme for EC economic convergence, Portugal favours the status quo. It sees no reason for realignment, emphasising that current tensions are not due to the escudo. The currency entered the 6 per cent wide band of the ERM in April and has remained at the top of the EMS grid since. SPAIN The government denies rumours that it is pressing for realignment and insists interest rates will remain high to stall inflation. Spain's new fiscal package will save Pta326bn (Pounds 1.781m) in tax increases and budget cuts. Central bank intervention allows controlled peseta slide against D-Mark closer to narrow band parity. Spain may take advantage of realignment but does not want to precipitate it. UNITED KINGDOM Debate growing in Britain about membership of the ERM. There are fears that membership, should Germany again tighten monetary policy, would force the UK to raise base rates and risk pushing the country towards economic slump, or otherwise see sterling come under pressure in the ERM. Nevertheless, the government says it firmly committed to keep sterling at central parity of DM2.95.</p>

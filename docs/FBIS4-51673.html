			<p>BFN     [Text] Rome, May 3 KYODO -- Japanese Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata said Tuesday [3 May] the next general election for  the House of Representatives should be held under a new  electoral system.    Hata, who arrived in Rome earlier in the day on the first  leg  of a six-day official visit to Italy, France, Germany and  Belgium, said the prime minister's power to dissolve the lower  house cannot be denied under any circumstances.    "However, looking into the reality, the Japanese people hope  for an election under a new system. And basically, I am not  thinking about dissolution now at all," Hata told Japanese  reporters traveling with him.    Bills centered on a change in the lower house electoral  system became law in late January.    Under the new system, 300 members are to be elected from  single- seat constituencies and the remaining 200 through a  proportional representation system. The present 511-seat lower  chamber was elected from the multiseat constituencies.    But the new system will not take effect until the  single-seat  constituencies are delineated in several months.    Hata suggested it may take less than a three-month period  for  voters to learn the locations after they become law.    "Some people think it is easier to restore their power under  the current system, but it is shameful to hold an election based  on such thought," Hata said, referring to opinions of some  members in the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ]  and new party Sakigake [Harbinger], both of which left the  coalition recently.    The premier inaugurated a minority cabinet Thursday, after  the SDP withdrew when other ruling parties formed a new  parliamentary group, "Kaishin" (Innovation), without consulting  the SDP.    "I will urge the SDP to reconsider. In apologizing for what  happened, I want to appeal to the SDP before anything else," he  said.    Hata also said he does not rule out the possibility of an  alignment of his party, Shinseito, and the leading opposition  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), but an appeal to the SDP takes  precedence.    The LDP surrendered its 38-year grip on power last August,  when it failed to maintain a majority in the lower house.    Sakigake, led by former Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi  Takemura, was a coalition government member before it defected.  It supports the Hata administration but refused to send  personnel to his new cabinet.    In relation to North Korea's suspected nuclear arms program,  Hata pledged that Japan will deal problems with care and "within  the framework of the (war-renouncing) constitution."    His remark reflects caution on legislation to deal with  emergencies, including possible international sanctions against  North Korea.    Hata also said he will seek the public's acceptance of  higher  indirect taxes, saying, "A graying society is at hand. It will  be difficult to secure necessary financial sources working only  with income taxes." He declined to mention the amount or timing  of a tax increase.</p>

			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR YOUNG ADULTS  </P> <P> Neither our educational system nor our society greatly encourages children to  cultivate their facility for make-believe. At school, children quickly learn to  value fact over fancy, common sense over poetry. The older they grow, usually  the more self-conscious they become about making up stories and the narrower  and more constrained their fantasies.  </P> <P> The best books retain the fluidity and richness of a child's imaginary life.  They also show how imagination can transform and recreate our world.  </P> <P> Lucie Babbidge's House by the late Sylvia Cassedy (Thomas Y. Crowell: $12.95;  243 pp.) is about an 11-year-old girl whose imagination is her only resource.  At school, her teacher, the archetypal spinster Miss Pimm, constantly holds her  up as a bad example to the class. Lucie's plain; she's obstinate; she barely  speaks, and when she does, it's in a croak. The other girls ridicule her as  goosey-Loosey; Miss Pimm despairs of her future.  </P> <P> At home, everything is different. Over tea and ginger cookies with Mumma and  her 5-year-old brother Emmett, Lucie rewrites her day, converting her  humiliations into triumphs. Mumma and Dadda think Lucie bright and beautiful  and are always loving and appreciative. Life among the Babbidges is elegant and  faintly British, like their afternoon teas and conversations in the drawing  room.  </P> <P> Yet, there are a few suspicious aspects to Lucie's life. Olive, the Babbidges'  maid, often sounds like Miss Pimm, and the Babbidges themselves resemble the  Pendeltons, an English family whose adventures Miss Pimm reads each day to her  class. There is also the mystery of Delia Hornsby, a girl from England, who  miraculously answers Lucie's letter to her dead great-great grandmother.  </P> <P> Cassedy, who died of cancer last year, cleverly and subtly constructed this  novel so that the reader only gradually comes to realize how much of Lucie's  world is make-believe. Not until a third of the way through do we discover that  Lucie's parents are dead, and that she is a waif among waifs, an outcast at the  orphanage. By presenting Lucie's fantasy world as real, Cassedy shows how  imaginary life sometimes can be more vivid than real life. Cassedy's funny,  poignant novel is a testament to the healing and transformative powers of the  imagination.  </P> <P> In Paul Fleischman's Saturnalia (A Charlotte Zolotow Book/Harper &amp; Row:  $12.95; 110 pp.), it is the author's imagination that transforms his subject  matter. Fleischman, a Newbery Award-winning author, returns to a territory he  has successfully explored before -- the early New England Puritans.  </P> <P> Fleischman takes an unconventional approach to writing historical fiction for  children. Although the novel has a 14-year-old as its central character -- a  Narragansett captured by the Puritans in their Indian wars -- the book neither  focuses exclusively on his struggles nor is confined solely to his point of  view. Instead, Fleischman smoothly shifts perspective back and forth between  the Indians and a colorful cross section of Boston life in December, 1681.  </P> <P> Among his unusual ensemble are a tithing man "walking the lightless lanes of  sin, routing out evil and blasphemy"; a grieving and guilt-ridden woodcarver; a  cruel eyeglass maker; a pompous wig maker, and his impudent servant and tutor  in love. The author shifts tone as easily as he does point of view, mixing  tragedy and humor, irony and farce in a textured and evocative meditation on  our colonial forebears.  </P> <P> The central figure who links all these disparate characters is the Indian  captive who has become a printers' apprentice. William in the white world,  Weetasket in the Indian, he wanders the Boston streets at night, playing his  bone flute and searching for his twin brother in his lost past.  </P> <P> Like William, Fleischman also is attempting to recapture the past. His  inventive approach to envisioning our colonial beginnings challenges readers to  stretch their own imaginative powers and to see the world from a variety of  viewpoints. Just as imagination allows Lucie to integrate the separate parts of  herself, it also enables us to reclaim our past and discover its relevance to  our present.  </P></p>

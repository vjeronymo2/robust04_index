			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Observer: No more a'roving It would seem that China's lapdogs are destined to stay right there. Beijing's City officials, having failed in repeated attempts to ban dogs outright, have now drafted a law that prohibits their appearance from markets, hotels, parks, schools, lifts, subways and public buses. The poor pooches must only be exercised at night, by an adult and with pooper scooper in-hand. These draconian restrictions are soon destined to include an annual licence fee of 6,000 yuan - which is more than double China's average annual urban income. Dog peddlers are barking mad; a snowy white Pekinese that just a few months ago would have fetched over 20,000 yuan (Dollars 2,350) is difficult to sell for 500 yuan (Dollars 60). 'We can't even give them away,' said one.</p>

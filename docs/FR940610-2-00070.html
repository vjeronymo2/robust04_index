This primary prevention program is funded by CDC with support from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Office of Lead-Based Paint Abatement and Poisoning Prevention (OLBPAPP). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of Healthy People 2000, a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life. This announcement is related to the priority area of Environmental Health. (For ordering a copy of Healthy People 2000, see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> WHERE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  section.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> Authority <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> This program is authorized under sections 301(a) (42 U.S.C. 241(a)) and 317A (42 U.S.C. 247b&hyph;1) of the Public Health Service Act, as amended, and section 1011(a&hyph;f) of Title X (42 U.S.C. 4851  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ) of the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act. Program regulations are set forth in Title 42, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 51b. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Smoke-Free Workplace <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of the American people. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Eligible Applicants <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Eligible applicants are the 37 current recipients of CDC grant funds for State and Community-based Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Programs that meet both of the following requirements (prior to the grant award being made): <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. At the time of the grant application, an applicant must have an approved Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) under section 105 of the National Affordable Housing Act (NAHA), (42 U.S.C. 12705) that includes a lead-hazard control element. Current CHAS regulations are set forth in title 24, Code of Federal Regulations, &sect;576.31. (Applicants are permitted to use an abbreviated housing strategy, as set forth in &sect;91.25 of the CHAS regulations.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. By September 1, 1994, applicants must have State enabling legislation and promulgated regulations in place to establish a State Certification and Accreditation Program for contractors, inspectors, workers, and others engaged in lead hazard control activities. The State Certification Program shall be consistent with the currently identified elements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Model State Plan being developed under Title IV, sections 402 and 404, of the Toxic Substances Control Act (see Appendix E of the HUD NOFA). (For ordering a copy of the HUD NOFA, see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> WHERE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  section.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The applicant must furnish copies of the enabling legislation and/or promulgated regulations, as well as other appropriate documentation, as proof of the program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Availability of Funds <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Approximately $2,500,000 will be available to fund up to two neighborhood-based childhood lead poisoning primary prevention programs. Awards for the first budget year will range from $750,000 to $1,250,000 each. Awards are expected to begin on or about September 1, 1994, and will be made for a 12-month budget period within project periods not to exceed 3 years. Funding estimates may vary and are subject to change based on the actual availability of funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These grants are intended to develop, expand, or improve collaboration among childhood lead poisoning prevention programs, community housing agencies, and neighborhood groups to ensure the identification and reduction of lead hazards in neighborhoods with a large proportion of demonstrated high-risk housing, and with a high percentage of young children living in these houses. Grant awards cannot supplant existing funding for childhood lead poisoning prevention programs or hazard reduction activities. Eligible applicants may enter into contracts, including consortia agreements, as necessary, to meet the requirements of the program and strengthen the overall application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> Note <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Not more than 10 percent of any grant may be obligated for administrative costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;HUD funds under this announcement should target ``priority housing''_defined as housing that qualifies as affordable housing under section 215 (appendix G of HUD NOFA) of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 12745). Priority housing does not include public housing (whether Federal or locally supported), federally owned housing, or any federally assisted housing except tenant-based housing that receives assistance under sections 8(b) or 8(o) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f(b) or (o)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Applicants are advised that an operational State Certification and Accreditation Program is an essential prerequisite for implementing lead hazard reduction activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Historically, most approaches to childhood lead poisoning have been reactive. After a child has been identified as poisoned, action may be taken to investigate the home environment to identify and address lead hazards. This approach provides epidemiologic and some preventive benefits by identifying and providing for the control of demonstrated, immediate hazards to which the same children, their siblings, and playmates might subsequently be exposed. However, relying solely on the presence of poisoned children to identify housing that contains lead hazards is considered to be ``secondary prevention,'' in that it postpones action until after a child is exposed to lead. Moreover, the reactive, child-by-child and house-by-house approach is an inefficient use of resources in the long run. A ``primary prevention'' approach emphasizes identifying and correcting lead hazards in the neighborhood  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> before children are poisoned, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  shifting the focus from the poisoned child to the environmental exposure source_most often, the child's home. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

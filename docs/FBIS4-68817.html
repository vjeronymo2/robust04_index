			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Clients' Victory Was Short-Lived"] </F>   [Text] Calculations of the Analysis Department of the  MediaSOFT Association show that in February-March of this year  the profitableness of private investments in Novosibirsk banks  exceeded the level of inflation for the first time in recent  years.    Two circumstances were behind this: the sharp decline in the  rate of inflation in these months and the fixing of a rate of  interest on private deposits in Novosibirsk which was a record  for Russia.    The monthly rate of increase in the price of the dollar and  inflation and the increase in a hypothetical bank deposit at a  monthly 15 percent (which corresponds to the average one- to  three-month level of the private deposit rate in Novosibirsk  banks in February) were used for the analysis.    The results were as follows: In February-March inflation  constituted 15.6 percent, and the increase in the deposit, 31.7  percent, while the dollar increased only 11.5 percent.    Thus the real increase in the deposit (adjusted for  inflation) constituted 16.1 percent in the two months. This  increase in a bank deposit even for a year is a fantastic amount  for world practice, and the said profitableness in developed  countries is typical only of speculation in securities, real  estate, and so forth, but not of bank deposits.    Depositors in Novosibirsk's banks have for the first time  won  out over the increase in prices. On the other hand, the banks  have for the first time lost appreciably, attracting deposits on  terms profitable to the public. The banks had run into the  obvious decline in the demand for credit, which had become too  costly even for commercial transactions.    It is not surprising that at the present time Novosibirsk's  banks are being forced to lower the rate on private deposits to  the 10-13 percent a month level. This reduction is kind to the  depositors here since with the present rate of inflation in the  region the profitability of the private deposits is maintained,  albeit not promising fabulous riches.</p>

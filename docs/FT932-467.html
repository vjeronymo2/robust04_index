			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Regional differences give new lease of life to commercial property: There are wide variations in how the market is responding to the upturn AS EVIDENCE mounts that the commercial property market may have turned the corner, wide variations are appearing in the behaviour of different sectors and regions. Differences arise also in the behaviour of the two factors that underpin property values: rents and investment yields. So far, the improvement in values results entirely from a fall in yields of other investments as investors return to the property market. Rents are still falling, albeit at a slowing rate, reflecting the weakness of tenant demand. Yet some trends are gradually emerging. Property in London and the south-east, the first markets to move into recession, may be showing the strongest signs of improvement. The north-south divide, whereby northern property has markedly outperformed that in the south during the recession, is being reversed. Mr Tim Stevenson of Chesterton, property advisers, said there were signs of 'a ripple effect' - changes in London are spreading gradually through the rest of the country. The effect is partly attributed to the metropolitan bias of decisionmakers, but it also reflects the disproportionate fall in rents seen in London, where office costs have fallen by more than half - compared with falls of 5 per cent in the midlands and the north. That has removed much of the incentive for companies to move out of London - and had a knock-on effect on rental values outside London. Relocation has slowed from its peak in 1991, when 36 organisations and 13,867 office jobs moved out of central London. Only nine moves are scheduled for this year and only five for the period 1994-96. There is more to the regional pattern of the property recovery than the 'ripple effect', though. While in London and the south-east, surplus property will continue to restrain rent increases for some time, elsewhere that is not the case. In north-east England, the 1980s boom never developed to a point where the market became glutted with new property. Mr Mark Finch of Sanderson Townend &amp; Gilbert, surveyors, said that had put the market in a stronger position should demand recover. He added: 'There is less available space, so if there is a gradual recovery it has a more marked effect.' Moreover, the smaller decline in rents outside the south-east makes it easier for expanding companies to move into new space. In oversupplied markets such as London offices, companies are often locked into their existing leases because they cannot find another tenant to take their place. The different segments of the market are developing in their own ways. In the north-east, for instance, retail property is generally performing well, but there is a mood of despondency about industrial property. 'The knock-on effect of the Swan Hunter receivership will put back recovery across the north-east,' Mr Finch said. In north-west England, it is the office market that is still under pressure, with industrial property over the worst, according to Lambert Smith Hampton, surveyors. In the south-west, there has been a marked increase in inquiries for industrial property, but concern about unemployment is depressing retail property, according to Chesterton. Looking at the country as a whole, however, there is a consensus that retail property will lead the recovery. Investors certainly think that way: in 1992, 87 per cent of institutional net investment went into the retail sector, according to the Investment Property Databank, a research group. According to Hillier Parker, the chartered surveyors that published a report last week saying that property values were starting to edge upwards, the proportion of empty property in the retail sector is less than 2 per cent, compared with nearly 6 per cent for the property market as a whole. There is little consensus about industrial property. In the past year, the office market has posted a worse performance than industrial property, with rent declines of 17 per cent and 8 per cent respectively, according to Hillier Parker. Retail rents, by contrast, fell on average by 3.4 per cent. Some analysts expect industrial property to perform better than offices because the effects of the devaluation of sterling will benefit exporters. The biggest influence for users of offices may be the attempts of many service industries to cut their payrolls and raise productivity. But it is the office sector, not the industrial sector, that has seen an improvement in yields. Some agents, such as Mr John Heawood of DTZ Debenham Thorpe, who chairs the Society of Business and Industrial Agents, believe that the strength of the industrial market compared with the provincial office market is exaggerated. 'In general, the recovery is patchy,' he said. Mr Heawood's caution about tenant demand is echoed by several regional agents, who are pointing to a weak and fragmented recovery. The enthusiasm for property shown by investors is not yet matched by a revival in the letting market.</p>

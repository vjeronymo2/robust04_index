			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> H-P Sees Lower Third-Quarter Profits: Hewlett-Packard Co. said its  third-quarter earnings would be below Wall Street analysts' expectations,  causing the firm's stock to fall $2.50 to $52.75 in New York Stock Exchange  trading. Hewlett-Packard said it expects to report quarterly earnings of 75  cents to 80 cents a share after a reduction of 10 cents to 15 cents due to its  acquisition of Apollo Computer Inc. in May. Analysts had expected the company  to earn about 90 cents a share for the quarter. The Palo Alto-based company, a  leading manufacturer of computers, earned 80 cents a share in the year-earlier  period.  </P></p>

			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Management: Why earn-outs can mean trouble in store - The pitfalls of taking a deferred payment when selling a company Alex Rice* is worried. One year into a three year earn-out arrangement with the company which bought his business Rice and the purchaser cannot agree on how much profit Rice's part of the group is making. Since Rice stands to make a lot of money if he can reach the targets set in the earn-out he is understandably concerned at the disagreement. 'On a day-to-day basis the arrangement has gone pretty much as expected,' he says. 'But now we have reached the stage of the year end audit and things are getting a bit heated. The profits are turning out to be a bit less than I thought. They say mistakes have been made but whether that is genuine is not quite clear.' Part of the difficulty, Rice believes, is that the purchasing company took over control of his accounting department and the accounting staff who used to report to him now report to head office. In addition to this the accounting systems were changed so it is difficult to compare the business's most recent profits with its performance in previous years. Rice hopes that when profits are averaged out over the three years of the agreement he will still qualify for a sizeable part of the deferred payment. But like many other company owners who sold out on the basis of an earn-out agreement he may be in for a rocky ride. Few of the earn-outs which became so popular in the late 1980s have run their full term. Most have been re-negotiated or terminated early when the vendor and the new owners of his company realised the deal was not working out as planned. Between 60 and 70 per cent of earn-outs - most of which are intended to run for between three and five years - are terminated within two years, according to Stephen David, a director of David Garrick, a London-based acquisitions specialist. The economic downturn has meant that many deals, negotiated in the more buoyant conditions of 1987-89, are producing less than expected pay-outs for the vendor. A survey by 3i Corporate Finance of eight recent deals which it negot-iated where earn-outs have been calculated showed three had produced less than expected pay-outs. Of 10 deals where earn-outs still had to be calculated six were not expected to live up to initial hopes. The earn-out rose to prominence in the second half of the 1980s as a method of allowing the owners of service sector businesses to realise what they believed to be the full value of their companies. Bidders were not prepared to pay high multiples for businesses with few tangible assets but they were willing to be far more generous if payment could be made dependent on future profits. Typically the purchaser would make an initial payment equivalent to the value of the net assets in the business and a second, larger payment to cover goodwill if the business which was being bought met agreed profit targets. Overuse of the earn-out technique has plunged some of the more enthusiastic bidders into difficulties. Many built up considerable commitments either to pay out cash or to issue shares. Publicly-listed companies such as FKB, a marketing group, WPP, an advertising company, and Shandwick, a public relations firm, have disclosed sizeable earn-out liabil-ities. The problems of the vendors, the owners of the small businesses so eagerly sought by the corporate empire builders, have been less well documented. 'The vendor has to be particularly careful in negotiating an earn-out,' says Stephen David. 'The buyer has the company and he also retains most of the money. All the vendor has is his contract.' 'What can you do if the purchaser does something you don't agree with?' asks Roger Wardell, who gained half of the maximum Pounds 4m possible when he sold his company by way of an earn-out. 'You would have to spend your own money fighting your case while the purchaser can use the company's money.' For the purchaser the earn-out is a means of retaining the loyalty and commitment of the owner-manager until he can put in his own managers. But earn-outs frequently face vendors with substantial conflicts of interest as they set what is best for the long-term future of the company against what would boost short-term profits - and the size of their earn-out. Fewer earn-outs are being negotiated in the more sober climate which now prevails but prospective vendors should watch for a number of key issues: The length of the earn-out. Do not tie yourself into a lengthy agreement during which the business and external circumstances could radically alter. 'Watch the length of the deal,' warns Ian Smith, a director of Livingstone Fisher Associates, a London-based acquisitions firm. 'Four to six year earn-outs are a nonsense. We normally look to arrange one to three year deals.' But even these shorter periods can prove irksome. 'I don't know how people sustain it for two to three years,' says Wardell, whose earn-out lasted just six months. 'From the point of view of both purchaser and vendor it must be a strained relationship. On the one hand the vendor wants to be loyal and group-minded but what if that hits him in the pocket book? You are pulled two ways.' The definition of what constitutes profits. Vendors should keep their original auditors or at least retain the right to call them in to ensure that the accounting rules are not changed, advises Neil Williamson, managing director of 3i Corporate Finance. 'Valuations of stock and work in progress are the most common sources of disagreement,' he points out. 'Write the rule book before you sign the final sale contract,' says Ian Smith. 'You don't want the buyer massaging profits or imposing unexpected management charges. There is so much room for interpretation in the accounting standards. Get your old accountants to check the numbers.' Problems in integrating the business in the larger group. To enable the vendor to distinguish the profits of his company from the larger group the newly-acquired company cannot be integrated into the group until the earn-out period ends. This is generally thought to work against the purchaser but does have implications for the vendor. 'It is true that the purchaser cannot impose anything on you but neither can you take risks,' comments Richard Payne, who recently completed a one year earn-out. 'The business went into a sort of limbo. It was quite unreal and meant that for a time I could not further my career with the company we had sold to.' It is problems with integration which most frequently lead to the premature ending of earn-out arrangements. If the buyer insists on making changes that should be taken into account in the profit calculation. One purchaser installed a computerised stock control system in its new subsidiary. Both the investment cost and the resulting improvement in profits had to be neutralised in the earn-out agreement. Safeguards if the purchaser cannot pay. Some buyers with extensive earn-out commitments have found they cannot afford to meet them. 'What do you do if the buyer cannot pay?' asks David Teacher, a partner in London solicitors Teacher Stern Selby. 'You can't sue because then the whole lot goes down.' Teacher's answer is to structure deals to give the vendor the right to regain control of his business if the purchaser is unable to complete. Even if the vendor does not actually want to regain control he is in a stronger position to renegotiate the deal in his favour. The culture clash when an independent entrepreneur becomes an employee in a larger company. 'The vendor goes to a smart hotel for the completion lunch and the champagne flows. Next morning he sits at his desk and gets a memo telling him he cannot keep driving the Rolls but is only entitled to a Ford Granada,' says Stephen David. 'That can cause problems.' The cultural issue is perhaps the most difficult to overcome. Many vendors find they simply do not fit in to the purchaser's more formal corporate structure. Many of the other pitfalls can be avoided, however, with a little planning. *The names of vendors and some details have been changed.</p>

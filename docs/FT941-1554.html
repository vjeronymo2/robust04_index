			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / International Company News: Wharf advances 33% in year Wharf (Holdings), the Hong Kong conglomerate controlled by the family of the late Sir YK Pao, yesterday reported net profits for 1993 of HKDollars 2.7bn (USDollars 349m), up 33 per cent on the previous year's HKDollars 2bn. The earnings, which were broadly in line with market expectations, included an exceptional item of HKDollars 589.3m on the sale of investment properties and were fuelled by a combination of a swollen property bank and rising rental fees. Taken on a per share basis, earnings rose 30 per cent to 127.3 cents, compared with 97.8 cents in 1992. Wharf's total asset base rose to HKDollars 100.5bn, representing a year-on-year increase of HKDollars 41.2bn. The net asset value per share rose 70 per cent to HKDollars 36.37. Some 75 per cent of profits came from the property side last year, and Mr Peter Woo, chairman, said new developments coming on line would fuel further growth this year. Mr Woo said: 'We are talking about 6m square feet of new space in Hong Kong of which profits have not accrued to previous financial reports and which has estimated future rental billings of close to HKDollars 2.5bn. 1993 profits came in at HKDollars 2.7bn, so with the three properties - Times Squares and Phases I and II of The Gateway - coming on stream, we are almost doubling the profit we are now able to generate, based on present profit generating assets.' Of the remaining core businesses, about 21 per cent came from transport infrastructure, mainly terminals, and the balance was split between hotels and, to a lesser extent, investment income. Mr Woo estimated Wharf Cable would be piped to 1.2m homes by the end of the year, at which time viewers will be able to tune into 20 channels. Directors are proposing a dividend of 66 cents, for a total annual payout of 85 cents, an increase of 31 per cent over the 1992 dividend of 65 cents.</p>

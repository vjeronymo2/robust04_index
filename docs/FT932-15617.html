			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Books: Allenby: the rise of a classy warrior - Justin Wintle considers the hero of Megiddo IMPERIAL WARRIOR: THE LIFE AND TIMES OF FIELD MARSHAL VISCOUNT ALLENBY 1861-1936 by Lawrence James Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 20, 279 pages VISCOUNT ALLENBY, the victor of Megiddo and pacifier of Egypt, is a hard target for the biographer to get in range. Nicknamed 'the Bull', he successively projected different personae. He was by turns a 'pattern' general, product of the Arnoldian public school system and Sandhurst, and the closest thing to George Patton among Britain's First World War generals. Sometimes he commanded by numbers, sometimes he exhibited sustained bursts of military genius. He only joined the army because he failed the Indian Civil Service entrance. He also failed the Staff College exam on the first sitting. Nevertheless TE Lawrence, who knew him as well as any man, could write: 'Allenby was so great that the comprehension of our littleness came slow to him.' If Allenby was great, then he was a late developer. The key to the character may well be the same as the key to the life: Allenby took a while to find his own range, but once he had done so, he was magnificent. His appetite for traditional soldiering - sweeping movements of well-disciplined, well-equipped and well-provisioned armies in the service of a cause - was singularly at odds with conditions on the Western Front, but came into its own in Palestine, on the periphery of the war. Yet the huge, polyglot triumph of Megiddo (under his command he had ANZAC, Indian, French, Armenian and Nigerian as well as British battalions) was not his finest hour: that came four years later, in 1922, when as High Commissioner in Egypt he took on Lloyd-George and the Cabinet. The government wanted the Wafd nationalist revolt crushed and British rule re-imposed, if necessary by maximum force. Allenby saw that a reasonable accommodation of Egypt's nationalist aspirations was the only course likely to secure control of the Suez Canal. In a Downing Street showdown he got his way. Allenby had proved himself not only a capable administrator but an astute politician to boot. He had spotted the great contradiction in British Middle East policy. On the one hand, if only to keep the French out, London had been prepared to grant Syrian Arabs independence; on the other, it sought to keep Egypt and the Sudan within the colonial fold. Britain could not have it both ways. The alternative would have been to argue in favour of France's share of the post-Ottoman prize. Whereas previous biographies have tended to gloss over Allenby's final incarnation, Lawrence James gives it detailed attention, even at the cost of an authorial contradiction. Imperial Warrior concedes that its subject, sorting out the Egyptians, 'was a pragmatist first and an Imperialist second'. 'Pragmatic Warrior' might have been the more accurate, if less sellable, title. Through the discontinuities of Allenby's career a unifying strand can be found: a canny regard for his own advancement guided by a sober attachment to duty. Allenby must have loathed serving under Haig in Flanders, but he had too much nous to bad-mouth his superior. The spectacular spleen was always reserved for subordinates; and it is indicative that the Field Marshal did not write, let alone publish, his memoirs. This sets the biographer at a disadvantage. Apart from some letters to his much-loved wife, there is little or no window on the inner man. But Lawrence James pulls a splendid rabbit from an unpromising hat. The strength of Imperial Warrior is its author's grasp of the history. Quite properly, the life is the campaigns fought. James makes fine sense of the Boer War (which created the disciplinarian and tempered the cavalry officer), the deadlock of the Western Front, the eastern Mediterranean and Egypt itself. Amid the flow of dispassionate judgments, there is room also for anecdote. We are reminded how, at the turn of the century, one Major-General Brabazon seriously suggested that the cavalry should be re-equipped with battle-axes, since these were 'ideally suited to the Anglo-Saxon temperament'. Of Allenby in Palestine we learn that he frequently drove to the front-line in a Rolls-Royce, while the RFC dropped cartons of cigarettes laced with opium on already demoralised Turkish troops. Best of all is an account of Allenby's intelligence officer in August 1914: keen to discover the pace of the German advance, Colonel George Barrow telephoned every station in Belgium from Mons. 'A reply in French or Flemish indicated they were still in Belgian hands. Silence or a German voice meant that they had been taken.'</p>

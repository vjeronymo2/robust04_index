			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Letter: A flawed capital rules strategy Sir, News that the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (Iosco) has decided to abandon its attempts to devise a set of rules governing minimum capital requirements ('Iosco drops common capital rules plan', February 11) should be welcomed by all those who regard the prudential regulation of securities companies as an important matter. The Iosco proposals were flawed in at least two important respects. First, under the banner of 'level playing fields' they sought to impose rules which completely failed to take into account the substantial differences in structure which exist between different securities markets. Second, the rules would have forced companies to look at risk in ways which were 40 years out of date and inconsistent with best practice in leading financial institutions. It is inevitable that at some stage the question of harmonisation will re-emerge on the agenda of international regulation. When it does, let us hope that political problems in reaching consensus do not, as on this occasion, lead to second-rate solutions to an important regulatory problem.

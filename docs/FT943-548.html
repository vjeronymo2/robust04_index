			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee futures recover after early setback Coffee futures prices suffered a sharp setback in London and New York yesterday following rainfall that brought light relief to drought-hit coffee plantations in Brazil. But prices recovered later in the day as prospects of further dry, warm weather kept the market in fairly bullish mood about the prospects of a substantial shortfall in next year's crop. The second position robusta contract in London was down Dollars 128 a tonne at one stage, following an overnight fall in New York. But it rallied to close only Dollars 58 lower at Dollars 4,025. In New York, the December arabica contract was 3.65 cents lower at 222.95 cents a pound in afternoon trading after trading 7 cents lower. One trader said speculators had sold long positions after prices had failed at several attempts to break decisively into new high ground. 'There's been a little clear-out, led by New York, but the background hasn't changed,' he said. The sharp recovery in prices this year to near nine-year highs on the back of two severe frosts in Brazil in June and July has led to expectations that producers will increase output. At a meeting of the International Coffee Organisation in London yesterday, Mr Guy-Alain Gauze, commodities minister for Ivory Coast, said his country planned to raise output from about 147,000 tonnes to 250,000 tonnes in the next two to three years. A new five-year international coffee agreement, due to come into effect on Saturday, is designed to encourage a greater flow of information on coffee trade between producer and consumer countries. However, it is not yet clear whether enough countries have ratified for it to enter into force automatically.</p>

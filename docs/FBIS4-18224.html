			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ute Semkat report: "Russians Withdraw From Brocken"] </F>   [Excerpts] Magdeburg -- The Gauss Point, the highest point  on Brocken Mountain, which is 1,142 meters and thus the highest  mountain in the Harz region, has been free of military troops  since yesterday. After 47 years of occupation the commander of  the Russian intelligence unit handed over the former Warsaw Pact  monitoring post to the Federal Property Administration yesterday  morning. [passage omitted]    At the official transfer ceremony yesterday  Minister-President Christoph Bergner (Christian Democratic  Union) stated that the departure of the Western Group of Russian  Forces (WGT) will not be the end of relations between the  peoples of the former Soviet Union and the Germans but the  beginning of a new, good coexistence.

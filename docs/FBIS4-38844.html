			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Denis Perkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 2 TASS -- Russia is quite ready to sign  a full-scale and specific agreement on cooperation with the  European Union, according to Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the  State Duma Committee for International Affairs. It is still  early to speak about Russia's membership in the Union but it is  already necessary to begin a serious preparatory process.    Closer economic ties with western Europe is also important  because Russia may soon join the General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade (GATT), Lukin said. Negotiations on this have  practically entered the home stretch.    The agreement with the European Union, according to Lukin,  must be equitable, correspond to the Russian state's short-term  and long- term interests and facilitate the provision of equal  opportunities in trade. This is the only way permitting Russia  to strengthen its currency and carry out economic reform  relaying on its own strength. So far the West's readiness for  equitable partnership in trade is expressed mainly in words and  as soon as competitive Russian goods hit the international  markets, the system of quotas and constraints is put in force.  This approach must be discarded, and specific, realistic and  tough negotiations should begin, Lukin stressed.    The principle of equality should prevail also in the sphere  of political partnership, Lukin said. Russia has a rich  experience of "reacting to crises" and is prepared for honest  cooperation in the settlement in prevention of conflicts in  Europe, proceeding from both the continental and national  security interests.    Touching on the Bosnian crisis in this context, Lukin spoke  out against the "ill-considered publicity-oriented airstrike  policy" and any bloodshed it is fraught with. He stressed the  need for peace dialogue at the negotiating table by the warring  parties.    As concerns Russia's possible part in the NATO programme  "Partnership for Peace", Lukin declared that the proposals which  Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev had taken to Brussels  took considerable account of the recommendations given him by  the State Duma and its International Affairs Committee.    According to Lukin, it was "an acceptable variant for a  serious discussion". As regards the outcome of Grachev's  discussions with the NATO leadership, it is to early to draw  conclusions because no detailed information on this score has  been forwarded by the executive to the Russian parliament.</p>

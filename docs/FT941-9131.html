			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Pay-off for former Saatchi chief The former US chief executive of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising Worldwide, part of the heavily indebted Saatchi &amp; Saatchi group, is to receive a pay-off believed to be worth about Dollars 6m (Pounds 4.1m) after just one year in the job. Mr Bob Kennedy, who had spent a large part of his career with the company, said last month that he was leaving to pursue other interests. He was paid about Dollars 800,000 last year, said Saatchi. The company refused to disclose the length of his contract, but said the compensation to be paid was 'the minimum under the terms of his contract'. The money will not be paid as a lump sum. It is widely believed that Mr Kennedy had disagreements with Mr Charles Scott, the recently-appointed chief executive of the group. Mr Scott has been taking a firm line with the US operation because of its poor performance. In December Saatchi &amp; Saatchi issued a profits warning and analysts reduced their forecasts for 1993 pre-tax profits, which had stood at some Pounds 24m to Pounds 29m, by about Pounds 6m. Results are due next month. A presentation to analysts by Mr Scott in the US recently suggested that the group's average net debt now stands at between Pounds 130m and Pounds 135m. The profits warning followed the loss of two large accounts in the US, worth Pounds 30m in revenue for 1994, plus pessimism about client spending in the US and Europe. Mr Scott has been trying to shake up the group's three agency networks in the US and attempting to introduce a media-buying operation along the lines of Zenith, Saatchi's European media-buying arm. However, he has been meeting resistance to the plan from some senior agency personnel.</p>

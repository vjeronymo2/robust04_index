			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Fifth Heathrow terminal plan: BAA move to beat congestion at airport welcomed by airline industry BAA, the former British Airports Authority, yesterday unveiled its long-awaited plans to build a Pounds 800m-Pounds 900m fifth terminal at Heathrow, which handles more international passengers than any other airport in the world. The scheme, expected to lead to a lengthy planning inquiry, was attacked by local residents but welcomed by the airline industry. Sir John Egan, BAA's chief executive, said the terminal would help Heathrow maintain its leading international position 'well into the next century' and safeguard 10,000 jobs there. It would also provide extra capacity for 30m passengers a year at Heathrow, one of the world's most congested airports, and a new base for British Airways, the UK flag carrier which accounts for 40 per cent of Heathrow's airline traffic. BAA had originally estimated the cost of building the terminal at Pounds 1.6bn, but Sir John said the estimate had been reduced to Pounds 800m-Pounds 900m because of improved pre-planning and better project management. The project would be financed from cash flow and some debt, although the borrowings would not affect the company's current gearing levels, Sir John said. Detailed architectural designs have yet to be completed by the Richard Rogers Partnership. Bovis, the construction arm of the P&amp;O company, is also working on the project. BAA is hoping to win government approval in 1997 after a public inquiry. The proposals envisage building the terminal at the west end of the airport on the site now occupied by the Perry Oaks sludge works. Agreement has been reached with Thames Water to move the sludge works to the nearby site of an existing sewage works at Iver South. The terminal is to be built in two phases. The first would cost about Pounds 500m and be completed in 2002. It would provide capacity for 10m passengers a year and parking space for 20 aircraft. The second phase, to be comoverall capacity to 30m passengers a year and provide parking space for 60 aircraft, including the new generation of very large widebody airliners. The terminal will be connected to three satellites linked by underground 'people movers'. Road links and a direct express rail line to central London are also planned. Sir John said the project would help Heathrow cope with the increasing demand for air travel in south-east England. BAA is forecasting a doubling of annual passenger movements in the London area to 120m passengers by 2002 and a trebling of demand to 170m passengers by 2016. After the slump in airline traffic caused by the Gulf war and the recession last year, activity has been steadily improving at BAA's airports. The company said that last month was its busiest April ever, with BAA airports handling 6.2m passengers, a 20 per cent increase on April last year and a 3.6 per cent increase on April 1990. BAA and the airline industry have long argued for extra capacity at Heathrow to maintain London's position as the world's leading international passenger airline hub. The International Air Transport Association said that, without the new terminal and other air traffic control and infrastructure investments, Britain stood to lose Dollars 1bn annually of economic activity by 2000. But local residents and authorities reacted strongly to the plans, fearing these would cause even greater noise, traffic congestion and other disturbances. In an effort to allay these fears, Sir John said the terminal project did not involve the construction of a new runway at Heathrow nor extra night flights because new larger and quieter widebody aircraft would help transport many more passengers on a single flight.

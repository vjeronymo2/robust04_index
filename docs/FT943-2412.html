			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / World News in Brief: Lib Dem cannabis vote upsets Ashdown The Liberal Democrat conference embarrassed the party leadership by calling for the use and possession of cannabis to be decriminalised. Leader Paddy Ashdown said the party's election manifesto would include no such commitment. Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce (left) said he planned a 10 per cent income tax band and rejected an increase in the top rate of income tax to 60 per cent. He proposed that no one should pay tax above 50 per cent. Conference reports, Page 12; Political chaos theory, Page 20; Observer, Page 21</p>

			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH CALLS FOR 'FRESH THINKING' ON MIDDLE EAST  </P> <P> President Bush on Saturday called for "fresh thinking" to combat the daunting  challenges that remain in the Middle East a decade after the historic accord  between Israel and Egypt.  </P> <P> Bush said in a statement released by the White House that the treaty that ended  more than 30 years of war between the two countries 10 years ago today was "the  product of vision, statesmanship, courage and persistence on the part of all  the participants."  </P> <P> Bush was spending the weekend with his family at Camp David, the presidential  retreat where Israel's Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat worked  out the historic agreement with then-President Jimmy Carter.  </P> <P> "Recognizing the historic achievement of 10 years ago, however, turns our minds  toward the still more daunting challenges ahead," the President said. "We need  to complete the work they began. We must commit ourselves, as Anwar Sadat and  Menachem Begin did, to fresh thinking."  </P> <P> Bush said there is "growing understanding that a settlement can be reached  which both satisfies Israel's security needs and addresses the legitimate  political rights of the Palestinians."  </P></p>

The Orioles didn't manage an extra-base hit until Bill  Ripken lined a two-run double off Mark Clear, and totaled only two. The second  was a two-run home run in the ninth by Cal Ripken, who joined Ernie Banks and  Vern Stephens as the only players to hit 200 home runs as a major league  shortstop.  </P> <P> "I was overthrowing the ball, rushing," Langston said. "It was terrible."  </P> <P> The Angels' sixth defeat in seven games and 16th in their last 21 left them 10  1/2 games behind the first-place Oakland Athletics, the Angels' first  double-digit deficit of the season. Worse, it obscured the memory of Chuck  Finley's exemplary three-hit shutout of the Orioles on Tuesday, which the  Angels had hoped might lift them out of their funk.  </P> <P> Instead, they slid back.  </P> <P> "Obviously, we're not in the situation we want," Langston said of the  sixth-place Angels. "Chuck did such a great job (Tuesday) and I wanted to keep  the ball moving. I let the team down, and that's very frustrating for myself."  </P> <P> So bad did Langston deem his performance that he wondered why Oriole Manager  Frank Robinson asked home plate umpire Larry McCoy to check the ball and his  cap for pine tar in the second inning.  </P> <P> "Beats me why he bothered," Langston said. "I probably should have used it."  </P> <P> The Orioles seem to profit more by taking pitches, as shown by a league-low  .229 batting average and a league-leading 134 walks. Langston said he felt "as  strong as I've felt this year," but that abundance of strength didn't translate  into the fearsome fastball and delicate control that allowed him to command $16  million in the free-agent market last winter.  </P> <P> Langston struggled from the outset but helped his cause by starting a pickoff  in the first and was aided by Lance Parrish's throw on Phil Bradley's stolen  base attempt in the third. He was flailing by the fifth, in which the key hits  were Randy Milligan's two-run single and two-out RBIs by Dave Segui and Bob  Melvin.  </P> <P> "I think he's just trying to do too much right now," pitching coach Marcel  Lachemann said. "It's a thing guys fall into once in a while. Bases on ball  don't make it easy.  </P> <P> "It's more a matter of getting to the point where he's relaxing than mechanics  and things like that. Right now, it's a matter of him not trying to do too  much."  </P> <P> The Angels couldn't do much at all against Oriole starter Pete Harnisch (3-0),  although Harnisch owed much credit for the complete-game victory to his  outfielders. Parrish was robbed three times, once to each field, and Dante  Bichette's long fly ball to center with two on in the sixth was snared by Mike  Devereaux to preserve a shutout, at least temporarily.  </P> <P> The only Angel run came in the seventh, on a double by Mark McLemore and a  single by Luis Polonia.  </P> <P> Said Chili Davis, who was one for four: "We get hits, but we're not getting key  hits. It's tough to elaborate on things because there's going to be a lot of  negative things, and I don't want to dwell on those.  </P> <P> "This team will get hot. It's frustrating for the front office and the fans,  but more frustrating for us because we aren't coming together as a team. But  it's going to happen. We have to bear down and try hard and not try to do too  much. We each have to do our individual job."  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> Jimmie Reese, who suffered a mild heart attack last week, was released from St.  John's Hospital in Santa Monica and is resting at home. The 85-year-old  conditioning coach is not expected back in uniform until after the All-Star  break.  </P> <P> Shortstop Dick Schofield is scheduled to undergo another Magnetic Resonance  Imaging test today at Centinela Hospital Medical Center in Inglewood to  determine how his strained hamstring is healing. Schofield was injured during  spring training and has yet to play this season. Reliever Bob McClure, on the  disabled list because of a sore left elbow, threw for 15 minutes Wednesday --  including six minutes off the mound -- and reported no discomfort. He will  continue to throw if no problems arise today.  </P> <P> Several Anaheim Stadium employees said they had heard Wednesday that Brian  Downing had retired and was to be paid $500,000 by the team. In truth, the  retiree was pitcher Mike Smithson, who was released by the Angels the weekend  before the season opened.  </P></p>

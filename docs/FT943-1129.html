			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Arts (Openings): Gothenburg Sweden's second biggest city celebrates the opening of a new opera house on Friday. Built to replace the small, antiquated Grand Theatre, the new Dollars 80m harbourside theatre is the result of decades of political wrangling over site and cost. The first three nights are gala performances featuring Ingvar Wixell and other distinguished Swedish singers. The first new production is Blomdahl's 1959 opera Aniara, opening on October 15.</p>

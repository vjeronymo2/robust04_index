			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Stepped-upsecurity slows crime rate: Reported incidents have fallen by 50 per cent in some of the more affluent suburbs ONE of the benefits of the Earth Summit for local residents has been the spectacular drop in crime in Rio de Janeiro's smarter neighbourhoods. A combination of 35,000 army and police personnel and 10,000 extra hotel security guards has caused the number of reported incidents to fall by as much as 50 per cent in some areas. Locals are already asking for the army to stay after the party is over, but the high command is fearful troops may be corrupted if they remain in contact with Rio for too long. Not everyone is happy with the stringent security arrangements. Foreign correspondents at the conference centre are compiling a petition to protest about the assault on a Visnews television reporter by Brazilian security guards after he failed to stop when running with a tape to catch a satellite feed. 'Brazilians assume that only thieves run,' complains a colleague. The current villain of the summit, US President George Bush, will, it transpires, be spending his birthday in Rio. Given the present isolation of the US adminstration, rotten tomatoes and protest banners are more likely to be the order of the day on June 12 than cakes and candles. A taste of what is to come was made clear during an ecological march along the beach on Sunday at which the most polite banners carried statements like 'Bush Lead or Get Out of the Way', 'USA Join The World' and 'You're Embarrassing US'. Journalists have been surprised at how freely US officials are handing out copies of the notorious leaked memo from Mr Bill Reilly, Environmental Protection Agency chief, which asks the White House to agree a 'fix' on the controversial biodiversity treaty. Enemies at work trying to embarrass the man further? Apparently not. Insiders say Mr Reilly's supporters are distributing it in order to assert his green credentials and to try to shame the White House into a last-minute face-saving initiative.</p>

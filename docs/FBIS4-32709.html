			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Tomasz Wroblewski from Washington: "United </F> States: There Will Be No Military Assistance to Poland"]    [Text] Two weeks before President Clinton's visit to  Warsaw, the U.S. Administration decided to object to a law that  was supposed to speed up Poland's joining NATO.    According to the draft law (written by Paul Simon of the  Democratic Party and Hank Brown of the Republican Party),  Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary were supposed to be  included on the list of countries that would be able to receive  surplus U.S. defense equipment. Within the framework of special  cooperation programs, the Polish Army would be able to lease  U.S. military equipment, draw upon U.S. expertise, and gradually  change its equipment to make it conform to NATO standards. The  draft law also envisioned the signing of agreements, using the  agreement with Korea as a model, concerning rapid supplies of  aerial weapons.    Senators Simon and Brown have expressed their hope that the  law will speed up Poland's integration into NATO. In a  conversation with ZYCIE WARSZAWY yesterday, Brown's press  spokesman confirmed that the Department of State took a negative  position on the draft law in this form. The White House  declined comment.</p>

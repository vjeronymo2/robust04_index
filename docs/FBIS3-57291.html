(Law), Professor of the Institute of State and  Law of the Russian Academy of Sciences, as his representative at  the Federal Assembly.    In an interview with Interfax Monday, Yakovlev said that he  would be responsible for interaction between the president and  parliamentary structures. He said that the new Russian  Constitution provides the right of the legislative initiative  for the president. As the president's representative in the  Federal Assembly, Yakovlev will represent the legislative  initiatives, follow their discussion in parliamentary factions  and committees and search for ways for compromises in case of  objections.    At the same time he considers it necessary to take care of  the "reverse contact," that is of informing the president on  sentiments, wishes and complaints of deputies so that the  contact be harmonious and there will be no tensions due to thee  shortage of information.    According to Yakovlev, he was informed about the new  appointment on January 24 by the president's chief of staff  Sergey Filatov, who met Yakovlev earlier and informed him of his  new duties.    Yakovlev was born in 1927 in Leningrad. He worked for  institutes of law (of the Interior Ministry, the Prosecutor  General's Office, and the USSR Justice Ministry). Since 1975 he  has been working for the Institute of State and Law of the  Russian Academy of Sciences.    He has said that performing the duties of the Russian  president's representative in the Federal Assembly, he intends  to continue his membership in the Learned Council of the  Institute and use the potential of this institution for  developing draft laws.    Yakovlev has parliamentary experience because he was deputy  to the Soviet Supreme Soviet.    As it has become known to Interfax, he was a co-author of  the  provision "On the President's Representative in the Federal  Assembly." Yeltsin signed the decree on introducing the post to  help provide the interaction between the president and the  Federal Assembly on January 18.</p>

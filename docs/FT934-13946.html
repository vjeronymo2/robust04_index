			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchange: DM eases on repo cut hopes EUROPEAN currencies trod water yesterday, gaining slightly against a weaker D-Mark as investors looked for signs of a more mellow attitude in the Bundesbank's interest rate policy, writes Peter John. Economists believe the conditions are now right for a small cut of between 5 and 10 basis points in tomorrow's repo, currently 6.7 per cent. This would raise hope for cuts in other official rates. Much will depend on the level of money supply growth. The latest M3 data are due some time this week, possibly tomorrow, and any figure below 7 per cent will be taken as an encouraging sign on inflation and interest rates. The Bundesbank has set a target of 4.5 to 6.5 per cent. Feelings that lower German rates are back on the agenda combined with the shifting of big D-Mark positions. Many dealers who had bought the German currency last week at the expense of the Belgian and French francs were moving funds into dollars yesterday. One dealer said: 'However limp the recovery in the US, it is better than in Europe.' The strength of the dollar was further helped by a cut in the prime lending rate by Morgan Guaranty, the US bank, from 6 per cent to 5.5 per cent. Many investors feel that other banks will follow the lead and pass on the effect of existing low official rates to customers. The reduction was also seen to reflect a return to profitability for hard-pressed US banks. The dollar reached Y107.70 in spite of an increase in the Japanese trade surplus and closed at Y107.45, up from Y107.05 previously. Against the D-Mark, the dollar rose to DM1.6270 from DM1.6145. In New York it ended at DM1.6390 and Y107.43. It also performed well against sterling, which fell to Dollars 1.4980 from Dollars 1.5125. The pound was hampered by a disappointing survey on consumer confidence, which added weight to the belief that a further cut in interest rates is necessary and might have to be a full percentage point rather than the half-point cut that many analysts had expected. Mainland European currencies appeared slightly stronger against the D-Mark after the strains of last week, but the strength was possibly deceptive. Many rose in a technical reaction to the strength of the dollar against the D-Mark, rather than genuine buying. The French franc closed at FFr3.5350 to the D-Mark, up from FFr3.5410 even though many are looking for a reduction in the 6.75 per cent intervention rate on Thursday. The Belgian franc recovered to BFr21.88 against the German currency, up from BFr21.99, but worries over the economy and impending social pact were not receding. Some high-yielding currencies did see buying. The Italian lira, which offers a return on three-month money of around 8.5 per cent, strengthened to L975.8 against the D-Mark from L982.4. The Swedish krone improved to SKr4.8410 per D-Mark from SKr4.8751.</p>

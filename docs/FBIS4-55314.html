			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kazimierz Groblewski: "Five Extraparliamentary </F> Groupings Will Form a Confederation Today; Flirting With the  Right"]    [Text] The Conservative Party [PK], Center Accord [PC],  Movement for the Republic [RdR], and Christian-National Union  [ZChN] will become the Polish Union confederation on Thursday  [12 May]. They intend to run jointly in the self-governmental  elections and then in the parliamentary elections; they also  want to back the same candidate for president.    There is more to the confederation than the forms of  cooperation among these parties so far; however, it is less than  their leaders declared immediately after the last elections. At  that time, they were speaking about the necessity of uniting  quickly.  <H5>  What There Has Been: Partings and Comebacks </H5>   Before the parliamentary elections in 1991, for the PC,  which  was quite a significant party, the ZChN was a minor little party  full of phobias. Jaroslaw Kaczynski was trying to build up the  image of his party as a proreform, center grouping, as a modern  Christian democracy. The PC considered the ZChN to be extremely  rightist, a traditional grouping that, conscious of its own  weakness, wanted to enter the parliament by gaining the support  of the church and by concealing itself behind the slogan of WAK  (Electoral Catholic Action).    After the elections, this ceased to bother Kaczynski--it  turned out that the ZChN would have a considerable club in the  parliament.    Both parties survived several months in a joint coalition  supporting the Olszewski government; they defended it with  determination. Then they unanimously turned against the  "recommunist government of Pawlaks and Wachowskis" (this is what  the Pawlak Cabinet was called by the participants of the PC  congress, which was being held at the time).    At that time: The RdR is formed within the PC and leaves the  grouping (the RdR is the third participant of the confederation  that is being formed today). Relations between both parties are  not very good, largely because of the circumstances under which  the RdR was formed--as a result of a split within the PC. Apart  from that, Jaroslaw Kaczynski and Jan Olszewski were already not  really fond of each other at that time.    The Suchocka government is formed. At night, during  negotiations on the establishment of this cabinet, the  center-rightist "five" splits. The PC leaves the conference  room, the other groupings remain (the ZChN; Peasant Accord; the  Party of Christian Democrats, PChD; and even the closest ally of  the PC at the time, the Peasant-Christian Party, the SLCh).  This is a defeat for Kaczynski's prestige.    The ZChN, in coalition with the Democratic Union [UD] and  the  liberals, goes through a stage of "civilizing." The ministers  of the party of Wieslaw Chrzanowski cooperate quite well with  the ministers of UD and the Liberal-Democratic Congress [KLD].  UD, the KLD, and the ZChN become so accustomed to one another  that, after the downfall of the government, there are  politicians who mention the possibility of forming a joint  coalition in the September 1993 parliamentary elections.    In the meantime, the PC also goes through a period of  transformation, but in an entirely different direction. It does  not decide to become a "constructive" opposition to the Suchocka  cabinet. In the parliament, the PC is alone; being jointly in  the opposition does not cause Olszewski and Kaczynski to join  forces. Olszewski on his side and Kaczynski on his gather  smaller, very radical rightist groupings around them.    From the fall of 1992 to the spring of 1993, a number of  cooperation declarations are signed, and coalitions for Poland  are established. These are the times of the "June Left," of  rightist politicians' touring Poland.    The PC expresses sharp criticism of the Suchocka government  and the ZChN. Politicians of the ZChN retaliate and make ironic  remarks concerning Kaczynski's party.    The Suchocka government, not long before its downfall, is  left by the PL--the fourth grouping making up the confederation  today (it proved disloyal to the ZChN, with which it was an ally  at the time).    Within the Suchocka government is Aleksander Hall's PK.  After the elections in September 1993, it is left by Kazimierz  Michal Ujazdowski and his supporters; they form the Conservative  Coalition [KK] (the last party of the "five" that make up the  confederation today).    Before the 1993 elections, differences between the PC and  the  ZChN are so great that no one, aside from a few politicians,  even mentions the possibility of a joint election campaign. The  roles change. Now the ZChN is a serious, proreform, civilized  grouping, whereas the PC is a small, "leader-oriented" party of  Jaroslaw Kaczynski, driven by internal conflicts.    The ZChN runs in the elections as the "Fatherland"  coalition, along with the "rightist" component of the Suchocka  cabinet: Hall's PK, the PChD, and the SLCh; the PC runs alone,  just like the PL and the RdR.    In the ensuing postelection shock, politicians of the  rightist groupings began to admit their mistakes and to announce  unification soon.  <H5>  What There Is: A Confederation </H5>   The confederation means not only less than unification but  even less than a federation. The five groupings will not have a  common leader. The constituent parties will maintain their  organizational identities. However, a council will be  established that will be an authority superior to the  authorities of the individual parties.    What stands in the way to unification of the five parties,  aside from their past? The parties do not want to give up their  identities. Each of them (this applies particularly to the  ZChN, however) believes that, as an independent party and by  maintaining its own structure, it may mean more than as a party  unified with other groupings).    Rightist politicians say that the greatest drawback of their  part of the political scene is not the large number of parties  but the existence, in almost each of them, of internal  divisions. Right now, they can be seen most easily in the ZChN,  but they also exist in the PL. The party that is most uniform  today is the PC.    Characteristic of the rightist part of the political scene  are great ambitions of the leaders of the groupings; in  addition, those leaders often do not really like each other. It  is difficult to imagine a situation in which Kaczynski,  Chrzanowski, Szeremietiew, and Janowski are supposed to decide  which one person will be the leader of the joint grouping.    Among those five groupings, there are real programmatic  differences. It would be difficult to reconcile the definitely  negative attitude toward trade unions, presented by Michal  Ujazdowski's KK (in the previous Sejm, Ujazdowski was one of the  initiators of the bill on limiting the role of trade unions)  with the stand of the PL (which has its origins in the  Individual Farmers' Solidarity) as well as the sentimental  approach to Solidarity that is taken by Kaczynski, Szeremietiew,  and Chrzanowski.    It would also be difficult to reconcile the PL's conviction  about the need for broad state intervention in the economy, with  the liberal approach of the KK.    Apart from that, the parties also differ, among other  things,  in their attitude toward integration with Europe: the  pro-European approach of the PC and the KK is confronted with  the approach of the ZChN, which may be called "Euro-skeptical."    If unification talks were actually held, the parties of the  "five," especially the PC and the ZChN, would certainly quarrel  if they were to verify the real strength of both parties in  regions. This would be closely connected to the distribution of  influence in the authorities and on the election lists of the  common party.    An issue that would have to be resolved if unification were  to actually take place would also be the definition of the  attitude toward the one-person rightist force that is  represented by Jan Olszewski. Even though the former prime  minister is now the honorary president of the RdR (not  Szeremietiew's RdR), he is not really taking part in the  political life of the right wing. His political activities boil  down to meetings with his supporters in church halls, cultural  centers, etc. He is advocating the model of concentrating the  rightist groupings with Solidarity. At his most recent meeting  on 9 May in the lower church of St. Andrew Bobola, he received  the greatest applause when he spoke about Walesa and said good  things about Solidarity.  <H5>  What Will There Be? </H5>   Rightist politicians are afraid of establishing too quickly  something that might break apart with a thump, which would  finally compromise the right wing. Apart from that, unification  carried out too quickly and forcefully might dissatisfy some of  the parties' members.    In reply to the accusation that the confederation is a form  that is supposed to replace real unification, the rightist  politicians say that they are implementing the plan that was  agreed upon early this year: first a confederation, then a  federation.    Activists of the ZChN and the PC no longer say today that  the  final purpose of the process of "unification" is real  unification. "It may be one party, but it does not have to be";  we hear both in the PC--that is, in a party that seemed to be  all for unification, and in the ZChN, a party that most opposed  the idea.</p>

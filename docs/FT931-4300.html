			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Kalgoorlie celebrates the centenary of Hannan's find - The chequered history and independent spirit of Australia's wildest mining town THE INDEPENDENCE of spirit that made Kagloorlie in Western Australia one of the world's most famous mining towns remains as fervent as ever. Tired of the long wait for the state government to build a by-pass to take the heavy construction equipment used in the gold fields around the town instead of through it, a group of townspeople last year built one themselves  -state bureaucrats are still scratching their heads and wondering if they can declare the new road illegal. Kalgoorlie today is in celebratory mood. One hundred years ago an Irishman called Paddy Hannan found a gold nugget in the desert and started the Western Australian gold rush, which brought gold hunters flocking to the town. Although Mr Hannan's luck rapidly ran out and he died in 1929 in relative poverty, he is still fondly remembered in Kalgoorlie where the main street is named after him and a bronze life-sized statue reminds visitors of the part he played in developing Australia's gold industry, now the third largest in the world. The town's streets remain as extraordinarily wide today as at Hannan's time, designed that way so that the camel trains that brought supplies to the town could turn easily. When trucks replaced the camels the animals were set free in the desert and quickly adapted to their new environment. 'Kalgoorlie is where you really feel isolated from the rest of Australia,' says Mr Ross Kennedy, managing director of Resolute Resources, a small gold mining company. 'It is a place where you can drink for 24 hours a day, gamble for 24 hours a day, screw for 24 hours a day or go to church for 24 hours a day. That's democracy. It also makes the town virtually crime free.' Paddy Hannan's find in 1893 attracted people from all over the world to this remote territory, helping to bring economic development to Western Australia, which still has fewer than 2m people in an area five times the size of France. The town's massive cemetery is a stark reminder of the hard times faced by the earliest inhabitants or 'diggers'. Water was scarce (and still is), sanitation was absent and disease rife. In this area there are no beaches and no mountains - just red dirt, heat, flies, gold and nickel. The town is also a notorious example of what damage unthinking miners can do to the environment. Before Kalgoorlie started to clean itself up six years ago and move its smelters out of town, the countryside looked, according to one executive, 'like Hiroshima after the bomb'. Miners had denuded the land of trees for miles around and a smelter next to the mine on the town's edge belched out all sorts of nasty substances into the lungs of miners' families, including high concentrations of sulphur dioxide. Not only has the smelter been moved but a five-year project was started in 1989 to re-treat the old waste dumps on the town's doorstep to get out the remaining gold and move them further away. 'Sure you could smell the sulphur dioxide in the air as you approached Kalgoorlie,' one mining engineer recalls. 'But the town had all the sporting facilities you could want and 29 pubs - what more could you ask for.' Kalgoorlie dealt more successfully with other mining town problems. Although prostitution is illegal in Western Australia Kalgoorlie's Hay Street is renowned for its well-managed brothels or 'traps'. One madame sponsored the local football team and one of the players recalls that 'there was never any recruiting problems because there were special prizes for successful players at the end of the season'. Hannan Street leads to the waste dumps and beyond them the Golden Mile, an area of one square mile, the heart of a mining camp that so far has produced more than 1,300 tonnes of gold or 42m troy ounces, worth about ADollars 20bn (Pounds 9.7bn) at today's prices. Like most mining towns, Kalgoorlie has had its downs as well as its ups. For 80 years the Golden Mile housed a huge number of underground mines, often going deep underground and where labour-intensive methods were needed to extract the gold. Production peaked at 1.2m ounces in 1903, a year when Kalgoorlie had a population of 30,000 supporting 93 hotels and eight breweries. The high cost of getting out the gold gradually caught up with the deep mines and activity in Kalgoorlie slumped until nickel was discovered nearby. 'We felt we were at the centre of the world during the nickel boom. In 1969 brokers from London poured off every plane that arrived,' says Mr Ron Manners, whose grandfather started a mining equipment supply company in the town and whose children remain in control. He is executive chairman of a small gold company, Croesus Mining. Australia's share of western world nickel supplies went from zero to 15 per cent in only three years. The number of employees in Mr Manners business increased from four to 48. Then the nickel price collapsed and he layed off all but three, closed his offices in town and worked from his home because, not only had the nickel boom ended as rapidly as it had begun, but Kalgoorlie's gold operations were at a low ebb. The last operating mine on the Golden Mile, Mt Charlotte, was about to shut down in 1975 when rescue came. The gold price, previously held at fixed levels by western governments, was freed. 'If Mt Charlotte had closed, miners would have left Kalgoorlie in droves. It would have become a ghost town. The gold price rise came just in time,' says Resolute's Mr Kennedy. New technology also helped to save the day for Kalgoorlie. This technology, particularly mobile milling plants and carbon-in-pulp recovery of gold transformed the industry by enabling miners to extract the precious metal economically from very low grade ore, even below one gram a tonne, compared with the 40 grams-a-tonne ore the Golden Mile mines were producing in the early 1900s. There were also innovative mining finance packages pioneered by Australian bullion banks. These included such things as gold loans at extremely low interest rates to be paid back from future production. A large number of open pit mines using large treatment plants were started around Kalgoorlie, often on the sites of the old deep-level mines. In 1984 Mr Alan Bond, the now-tarnished Perth entrepreneur, attempted to take the economies of scale to the limit by combining the many mines on the Golden Mile into one. In January 1989 he finally succeeded and agreed terms to merge his group's interests with those of Homestake, the US-owned company, into Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines. This brought together six open pits, five underground mines, five mills and 1,500 people; and its operations are being transformed into a 'super pit', one of the world's biggest man-made holes, which can be seen clearly from the moon. It will be at least 5 km (3 miles) long, 2 km wide and up to 500m deep. When Mr Bond's financial problems overwhelmed his group, his share of the super pit operations were sold to Mr Robert Champion de Crespigny's Normandy Poseidon group. Not everyone believes that this has been a change for the best. Mr Tom Bannerman, a lawyer who set up shop in Kalgoorlie in 1970, says the town then was still one where the local community ran the show. 'Today the ethos has changed. The town is full of earth-moving contractors waving their stubbys (beer bottles), the pubs are full of strippers and the town is more aggressive. I don't like it.' However, the Super Pit and exciting recent projects such as the Kanowna Bell mine being developed 20 km outside the town by joint venturers Delta Gold and Peko Gold, ensure Kalgoorlie has at least 20 years of thriving activity ahead of it. And yesterday, Mr Richard Court, who was elected Western Australia's prime minister only four weeks ago, again promised, at the Australian Gold Conference held as part of the centenary celebrations, that his government would encourage private industry to build a 2,000 km gas pipeline from the state's northern oil and gas fields to Kalgoorlie to bring cheaper energy to the gold fields. 'We believe that the high cost of energy is holding back many projects in the area,' he said, 'and the pipeline would reduce energy costs by up to 50 per cent. That level of reduction will not only encourage more resource development but also investment in value-adding industries.'</p>

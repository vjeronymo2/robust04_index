			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE HIGH SCHOOLS;  </P> <P> TWINS GIVE LEAGUE A LOOK ALL ITS OWN  </P> <P> Kim and Lori Martin and Amy and Julie Uhrman not only are two sets of sisters  who play on the same basketball teams, they are identical twins who compete in  the same league.  </P> <P> The Martins are the starting guards at Faith Baptist, and the Uhrmans are the  starting guards at Brentwood. When those teams pair off in Delphic League  plays, statisticians run for cover.  </P> <P> To make matters more confusing, Faith Baptist starts Erica Martin, the younger  sister of the twins, at forward.  </P> <P> "I can tell the twins apart now, but sometimes I still make a mistake," Faith  Baptist Coach Sally Dexter said. "I'll go through all three names before I get  it right. Last year it was easier because they wore their hair differently, but  this year, they both wear it back in a braid. It can be really confusing."  </P> <P> Lori Martin is Faith Baptist's leading scorer, averaging 17 points. She also is  averaging 5.6 rebounds and 3.9 steals.  </P> <P> Shooting surge: Apparently, it takes Chaminade's Colin Havert a while to  recover from the crushing blows sustained during football season. Havert, an  All-San Fernando Valley League tailback, also plays point guard for the Eagles  and has made an impact recently after a slow start.  </P> <P> Havert scored 28 points in a 72-64 victory over La Salle last week, including  three three-point baskets in the final four minutes.  </P> <P> "There's one thing I can count on," Coach Mike Lynn said. "When Colin's on the  court, he's going to create something."  </P> <P> Long time coming: Palmdale does not attempt many three-point shots. In fact,  Coach Gary Phelps, who doesn't even include the statistic in his weekly totals,  can count the number of his team's long-distance shots on, well, two hands with  two borrowed fingers.  </P> <P> Forward John Johnson's three-point shot in Friday's 63-57 Golden League victory  over Quartz Hill was only the Falcons' 12th of the season.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Quartz Hill Coach Don Moore on Palmdale's success at holding forward  Gabe Higa to 14 points -- including a solitary field goal: "They two-timed . .  . him underneath the basket," Moore said. "They had two pretty big kids. That's  why he had so many free throws."  </P> <P> Higa was 12 of 14 from the free-throw line.  </P> <P> Add Quotebook: North Hollywood Coach Steve Miller, assessing his team, ranked  fourth in the Valley, after its first 20 games: "Well, we're 18 and Grant."  </P> <P> The Huskies, of course, have been tripped just twice this season: both times by  the Lancers.  </P> <P> Staff writers Sam Farmer, Vince Kowalick, Brian Murphy and Naomi Tward  contributed to this notebook.  </P></p>

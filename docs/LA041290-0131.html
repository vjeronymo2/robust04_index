			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OLD AND NEW ARE COMBINED AS 13 MAKE DEBUTS  </P> <P> "Look at all those people!"  </P> <P> Tenise Harris peeked from the South Lounge in the Disneyland Hotel and got a  bad case of nerves.  </P> <P> "I'm so nervous I can't breathe," said Harris, a Chino High School junior and  one of 13 debutantes presented in the hotel's Grand Ballroom on Saturday night.  </P> <P> The party, attended by 565 guests from Orange and Los Angeles counties, was  sponsored by the Orange County chapter of Links Inc., a national community  service organization involved in educational, cultural and philanthropic  activities.  </P> <P> For Harris and her deb buddies, the night was the culmination of six months of  preparation -- including hours of volunteer work, etiquette training and career  counseling.  </P> <P> "We've tried to take an old tradition and modernize it," said Laura Rycraw,  event chairwoman.  </P> <P> Tradition prevailed at the fund-raiser, where career and civic concerns were  briefly displaced by pressing matters of makeup, hair, curtsy and waltz.  </P> <P> While the black-tie crowd sipped cocktails outside the ballroom, the  white-gowned girls, their families and escorts posed for formal portraits  behind the South Lounge's closed doors.  </P> <P> "Look at my beautiful baby!" cooed Earlene Owens as she combed Kamela Bell's  hair. Bell, a junior at Cerritos High School, is Owens' godchild.  </P> <P> Debutante Robynne Royster, a junior at the Los Angeles High School of the Arts,  said she'd wanted to be a debutante since she was a toddler.  </P> <P> "My mother was a debutante," said Royster, an aspiring actress who kept a cool  head while those around her tensed. "Starting when I was about 3, I used to  dress up and play around in her gown."  </P> <P> The presentation of the girls -- which included the requisite curtsies,  bouquets and tours of the ballroom dance floor -- began at 7 p.m., after brief  speeches by Rycraw, Links Inc. chapter President Iva Green and Jennie Spencer  Green, who presented scholarship awards.  </P> <P> Emcee Horace Mitchell, vice chancellor of student affairs at UC Irvine,  described the accomplishments of the "13 young, gifted and talented  African-American women . . . (whose) beauty (is) sweeter than the sound of a  musical instrument."  </P> <P> Also making a formal debut were Shelbi Titus, a junior at Cerritos High School;  Sharmarra Turner, a senior at Dorsey High School in Los Angeles; Gwendolyn  Williams, a senior at Saddleback High School in Santa Ana; Joi Williams, a  junior at Gahr High School in Cerritos; Sabrina Barry, a junior at San Pedro  High School; Russetta Bourda, a junior at St. Anthony High School in Long  Beach; Yolaunda Collier, a junior at University High School in Irvine; Heather  Davis, a junior at Whitney High School in Cerritos; Denise Johnson, a junior at  Corona High School; and Kristie Moore, a senior at Cerritos High School.  </P></p>

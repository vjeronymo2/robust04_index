			<p>BFN     [Text] The Government of Azerbaijan intends to sack the  National Bank chairman, Galib Agayev, "because of his failure to  conduct monetary and crediting policy satisfactorily and observe  the existing banking legislation." As Interfax learned from the  chairman of the standing governmental commission for economic  policy, Tofik Azizov, the issue of Agayev's resignation has been  submitted to Azerbaijan's president.    In March a special governmental commission checked up the  work of the National Bank, as a result of which gross violations  of legislation on banking activity were revealed, he said. For  instance, Azizov stressed, throughout last year the National  Bank issued credits totalling 292 billion rubles, and  subsequently sold those funds as credit resources,  notwithstanding the fact that they had not returned from  circulation yet. This brought about unfounded credit emission,  which, in its turn, caused higher inflation, Azizov concluded.    Last year the level of inflation made up 1080 percent, and  in  the first two months of the current year 200 percent. The  national monetary unit, manat, was put into circulation in  August of 1992, however in 1993 the National Bank made  settlements only in Russian rubles.    The chairman of the governmental commission also said that  last September, on instructions from Agayev, the National Bank  closed all the correspondent accounts of local commercial banks.  Such an action, Azizov pointed out, considerably complicated  interbank settlements as well as settlements with foreign  countries, CIS members among them.    According to Azizov, the ill-advised policy pursued by the  National Bank chairman brought about debt claims presented to  Azerbaijan by a number of countries, including Russia -- for  81.5 million dollars, Kazakhstan -- for 6 million dollars and  Turkmenistan -- for 9 million dollars, and resulted in  "unprecedented bribery on the part of commercial banks during  the receiving of cash, as well as in the forming of another  circle of monetary circulation which is beyond the National  Bank's control."</p>

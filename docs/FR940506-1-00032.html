			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 9. Were there any injuries to the vehicle occupants, pedestrians, emergency personnel, or other individuals? What was the type and seriousness of the injury? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. What type (steel, aluminum, fiberglass wrap, carbon fiber wrap, hoop wrap, full wrap, all composite, or other) was the fuel container? What were the dimensions of the container? What was the service pressure of the container? Who manufactured the container? How long had it been in service? To which design specification or standard were the tanks built? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. Should any Federal standard include a labeling requirement to address the periodic reinspection of fuel systems on alternatively fueled vehicles? Should States establish guidelines to address the periodic reinspection or recertification of such fuel systems? Should these schedules be set at specified time or mileage intervals? After a vehicle is involved in an accident? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. Should CNG heavy vehicles, which are not school buses, be crash tested for fuel system integrity in the same way as heavy school buses under FMVSS No. 303, i.e., a contoured barrier traveling at 48 kilometers per hour striking the test vehicle at any point and angle? If so, which types of CNG heavy vehicle should be included, i.e., transit bus, intercity bus, heavy truck, or other type? Are there other tests or guidelines which would be more appropriate to assure the fuel system integrity of such vehicles? If so, what are they? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Venting <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because of the size of these vehicles, there may be large enclosed areas in which natural gas could accumulate if there is a slow leak in the CNG fuel system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. Are there instances where gas accumulated? Did any of them result in explosions? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14. Should venting of the container away from possible areas of accumulation and potential ignition sources be required to address leakage accumulation? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15. What experimental or observed data are available regarding the dispersion behavior that results from a CNG fuel system leak? Will the gas rise or remain near the ground? If the gas remains near the ground, how long will it remain there? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Leakage Detection and Warning <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If there is a leak in the fuel system, there would be little or no visible evidence of the gas accumulation. If persons nearby could not smell the gas, it could accumulate in an area near them without notice, which would increase the potential for an explosion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16. Are there instances where CNG leaked out of a vehicle fuel system and caused a safety problem before the natural gas was detected? Describe how the situation occurred. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 17. Should a leakage detection/warning system be required in vehicles with a GVWR of over 4536 kilograms to detect leakage of CNG as well as to warn persons nearby of the potential hazard? What type of system? Is it commercially available? What would be the cost? Would the leakage detection/warning system, including its power source, become a potential ignition sources when activated? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Refueling <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA seeks information on potential safety hazards associated with the refueling of heavy CNG vehicles. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 18. Are manufacturers or fleet operators aware of safety hazards or accidents that have occurred during refueling operations? If so, please provide information on them. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 19. What items are included in current guidelines or procedures for CNG refueling, such as the need for grounding straps, operator protective clothing, etc.? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 20. Is a small amount of CNG normally released during connecting/disconnecting of the refueling equipment? If so, how much? Are devices, such as excess flow valves, used in refueling equipment to prevent excess CNG leakage in the event of a refueling line rupture? To what extent are such devices used? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 21. What standards or guidelines currently exist for refueling couplers and related equipment? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Submission of Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency invites written comments from all interested parties. It is requested that 10 copies of each written comment be submitted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No comment may exceed 15 pages in length. (49 CFR 553.21). Necessary attachments may be appended to a comment without regard to the 15-page limit. This limitation is intended to encourage commenters to detail their primary arguments in a concise fashion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a commenter wishes to submit specified information under a claim of confidentiality, three copies of the complete submission, including purportedly confidential business information, should be submitted to the Chief Counsel, NHTSA, at the street address given above and seven copies from which the purportedly confidential information has been deleted should be submitted to the Docket Section. A request for confidentiality should be accompanied by a cover letter setting forth the information specified in the agency's confidential business information regulation, 49 CFR part 512. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All comments received before the close of business on the comment closing date indicated above will be considered, and will be available for examination in the docket at the above address both before and after the closing date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To the extent possible, comments filed after the closing date will also be considered. NHTSA will continue to file relevant information as it becomes available in the docket after the closing date, and it is recommended that interested persons continue to examine the docket for new material. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Those persons desiring to be notified upon receipt of their comments in the rules docket should enclose a self-addressed, stamped postcard in the envelope with their comments. Upon receiving the comments, the docket supervisor will return the postcard by mail. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  15 U.S.C. 1392, 1401, 1403, 1407, 1417; delegations of authority at 49 CFR 1.50 and 49 CFR 501.8. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued on May 2, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Barry Felrice, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Associate Administrator for Rulemaking. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;10897 Filed 5&hyph;5&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;59&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

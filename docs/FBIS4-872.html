			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address to the nation by President Mahamane Ousmane in </F> Niamey on 15 April--recorded]    [Excerpts] Fellow Niger citizens and dear countrymen! A  year ago on 16 April 1993, I was sworn in as president of the  Republic and head of state. The celebration of this important  event should in no way eclipse another even more important event  -- the first anniversary of the final establishment of the  democratic process in our country. Indeed, thanks to God and to  the will of the sovereign people of Niger, democracy is  henceforth an indispensable reality in our country. [passage  omitted]    Dear countrymen, on this solemn occasion we deem it  important  to briefly recall the socio-political and economic context in  which we founded the state of Niger. On the socio-political  scene, the atmosphere was marked, among other things, by an  armed rebellion brought about by previous regimes' inability to  create conditions for the balanced and harmonious development of  the various regions; an increasingly dangerous situation of  insecurity in cities and the countryside; constant growth in the  unemployment rate, caused notably by the closing down of some  enterprises and with difficulties in getting a job in the civil  service; social conflicts, notably between farmers and livestock  rearers, and workers and employers.    On the economic scene, the report on the ad hoc commission's  review of the country's economic situation revealed the  catastrophic situation in which our country found itself on the  advent of the institutions of the Third Republic. This report  stated, first of all, a great imbalance in public revenues,  which resulted in arrears in salaries, scholarships, student  allowances, and the inability of the government to pay other  state expenditures. Then there also was the weight of the  external debt, estimated at several hundreds of billions of CFA  francs, and domestic debt, which was estimated at dozens of  billions of CFA francs.    Dear Niger citizens and countrymen, as you know, our country  has had to cope with many socio-political difficulties within  the past 12 months. These difficulties include a refusal to  carry out a democratic change in the government, ethnocentrism,  regionalism, an armed rebellion, and religious intolerance,  which caused losses in human lives. [passage omitted] Apart from  these numerous difficulties we have to cope with, it should be  admitted that the bottom line of the situation we are dealing  with is that there is an unprecedented financial crisis, a loss  of working hours due to the intransigence and impatience of  social partners, rallies and demonstrations which are often  marked by violence, acts of vandalism, and organized  insubordination. These, dear countrymen, are some of the many  dangers which threatened our young democracy, social peace, and  national cohesion throughout the year. Therefore, in order that  the democratic process, so dearly acquired, is not perverted or  spoiled, it is important to emphasize once and for all that  democracy does not mean anarchy, a license to do whatever one  likes, or apathy towards the state. [passage omitted]    Fellow Niger citizens and dear countrymen, the difficult  situation, we inherited as well as the numerous obstacles we  have encountered, have at no moment shaken our firm and  irreversible will to successfully implement our program. Our  members of parliament were conscious of this indispensable  reality, when they courageously and massively approved the  government's general policy statement, after detailed study.  Our action program gives priority to the settlement of social  issues, and that was why high priority was given to the  settlement of the problems affecting the university and other  schools, notably the payment of arrears in scholarships,  allowances, and registration fees. On the health scene,  considerable efforts were made to provide our health centers  with adequate personnel and essential medical supplies. This  shows that the aspect of human development constitutes a very  high priority for us.    The government attempted to tackle the painful issue of  armed rebels as soon it took office, following several meetings  and with mediation of friendly countries. We were then able to  embark on the first stage of negotiations in the search for  lasting peace. The frame of reference given to us by the  Coordinating Committee of Armed Resistance at the last  Ouagadougou meeting was analyzed by all the various groups. All  the information we received was compiled into source documents  for the government to be used in its negotiations with the  rebels. We have often solemnly reiterated that the Niger  Republic is one and indivisible. It is a democratic and social  country. We sincerely hope that at the forthcoming meeting in  Paris, we will find a quick solution to the tragedy which is  tearing our people apart. [passage omitted]    Our efforts at solving the socioeconomic crisis, which has  seriously affected our country, would have been even more  successful had it not been for the devaluation of the CFA franc  which forced us to realign our strategy. We are fully aware  that a country as poor as Niger needs foreign financial  assistance to achieve economic and social recovery. The  government of the Third Republic therefore renewed contacts with  leading bilateral and multilateral financial backers as soon as  it took office to establish an atmosphere of trust and serenity  which is indispensable [words indistinct] for acquiring foreign  aid. The ensuing results are highly encouraging and bode well  for a better future. However, no matter what aid we receive and  how much it is, foreign aid is subject to several restrictions  and conditions. It cannot therefore be the sole answer to all  our problems if there is no true national awakening. [passage  omitted]    The past year has been enlightening in more ways than one.  We have learned many lessons from being in power. The phase we  are about to embark upon will not be very easy. At a time when  we are trying to solve our problems on our own, we are faced  with the additional problem of social tension brought about by  opposition parliamentarians' desertion of the National Assembly.  Regarding the recommendations the National Assembly made to the  government in January following the debate on discrimination in  the various institutions, some people have the impression that  we have overlooked the pertinent measures contained in our 29  January parliamentary resolution on human resources management.  This is not so.    We would like to reassure you all that we will personally  see  to it that technical skill, moral values, and loyalty are  considered above all other factors and are used as the only  criteria for appointing people to any position of authority. I  give you my solemn pledge on this as guarantor of the  Constitution and head of state. We therefore call on the  opposition parliamentarians to forget all bitterness, show  high-mindedness and a sense of true love for their country, and  join their colleagues from the majority group at the National  Assembly in order that the first regular session of the year  might proceed unhampered.    My dear compatriots, the time has come for forgiveness and  consensus. We should all do our utmost so that there will be  peace, social harmony, union of hearts and minds, and tolerance  in our country once and for all. We should not lose our  legendary values of fraternity, harmony, serenity, and national  solidarity as a result of insidious political intrigues. All  sons and daughters of this country should accept the principle  of dialogue to solve all our differences in order to participate  actively in building a new Niger. [passage omitted including  indistinct portions]    May the Almighty God assist us and reward us with bountiful  rains. Long live democracy! Long live the Republic! Long live  Niger!</p>

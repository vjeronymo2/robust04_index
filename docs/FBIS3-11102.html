The foreign and economy ministers from the four member  countries (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay) today will  analyze the Brazilian proposal to create a South American Free  Trade Area (ALCSA), some of whose points were anticipated by  Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim in February in  Montevideo during the eighth meeting of the ALADI [Latin  American Integration Association] Council of Ministers.    The Brazilian proposal aims at liberating up to 80 percent  of  the trade in goods and services in South America during maximum  10-year period, between 1995 and 2005, as well as the  progressive, linear, and automatic lifting of trade tariffs to  practically include the entire regional market.    According to diplomatic sources, the idea not only is to  reinforce the hemispheric position of South America but also to  reinforce regional agreements like Mercosur, ALADI, and the  Andean Group.    A totally reliable government source told LA NACION: "This  is something to which Amorim referred to once. In case it is  approved, ALCSA should not hinder the other agreements like the  Group of Three, made up of Mexico, Colombia, and Venezuela, or  the free trade agreement between Chile and Mexico."    It has not been ruled out that the possibility of Mercosur  joining NAFTA might be discussed during the brief consultation  meeting among the Mercosur ministers. This was mentioned by  Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo during his tour of Germany and  on other occasions by President Carlos Menem and Foreign  Minister Guido Di Tella.    For the time being, expectations are centered on 1 July,  when  U.S. President Bill Clinton will send Congress a list of  countries he believes could join NAFTA.    It is known that the negotiation agenda for the four  Mercosur  members will be strictly respected.    Negotiations on a Common External Tariff [Arancel Externo  Comun -- AEC] remain on the agenda: 30 June was agreed on as  the deadline to reach an agreement.    A meeting during which important progress was made on the  chapter on chemicals was held recently. More than 80 percent of  the tariff positions were defined during the meeting.    The Common Market Group will meet in Buenos Aires during the  first days of April, and the Mercosur Council will meet on 9  July, possibly in Mar del Plata, with the presence of Presidents  Menem, Wasmosy, Lacalle, and Franco.</p>

			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Mappin &amp; Webb opens Prague store: Vincent Boland wonders whether Czechs are ready for the ultimate in consumerism The Czech Republic's new rich, thanks to the country's breakneck economic transformation, are no strangers to German cars, French perfumes, Italian clothes, Japanese electronics and American computers. Now they have been asked the ultimate consumer question: Are they ready for a hand-made, diamond-studded, Pounds 45,565 Rene Boivin wrist watch? One man who thinks they are is Mr Naim Attallah, chief executive of Asprey, the London jeweller which owns Garrard, the crown jewellers, and Mappin &amp; Webb, the upmarket jewellery and luxury goods chain. Yesterday Mappin &amp; Webb opened in Prague. 'I've got a good hunch about Prague,' said Mr Attallah, explaining why he chose the Czech capital as Mappin &amp; Webb's first European store outside the UK. 'It's new, it's enterprising, people are making money.' Mr Attallah said he believed Mappin &amp; Webb's Pounds 2.5m investment in the new store, located on the main tourist route through the centre of Prague's Old Town, would show immediate results. He said he expected turnover of Pounds 2m in the first year and profits of about Pounds 150,000. 'The risks are very minimal,' he said. 'It is definitely not too early to go in.' The store's main target is not, he insisted, the thousands of tourists who pass its front door every summer as they traverse Prague's famous Royal Route. 'We are opening for Czech business,' he said, adding that the store stocked more affordable items, too. Ms Wiz Marshall, Mappin &amp; Webb's promotions manager, who is overseeing the launch of the store, said the intention was to offer a little bit of English tradition. Private viewings may be arranged for top clients, and serious customers will be offered tea or a glass of wine as they consider a fine diamond, or a sterling silver cutlery set. This will certainly make a change from the scowls that often greet customers at many Prague stores. Mr Attallah said he originally planned to open a store in Shanghai, another city rediscovering its taste for free-wheeling capitalism and the material benefits it can bestow. He decided on Prague after 'wearing my feet out' wandering around the city one sweltering evening earlier in the summer, following a visit to the opera.</p>

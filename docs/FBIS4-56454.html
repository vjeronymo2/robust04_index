			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial from the "Notes and Information" page: "Protected </F> Markets"]    [Text] President Bill Clinton has one month, until 3 June,  to decide whether to renew or remove most favored nation status  for the PRC. He was counseled by the entire spectrum of the  American foreign policy establishment not to spoil relations  with Beijing. Not even for this reason did Clinton quit treating  the PRC as a third-class world power, and submitted its leaders  (in Beijing) to the humiliation of telling them how to treat  common and political prisoners, workers, and travelers. In name  of human rights, Clinton created an impasse. The Chinese cannot  lose face, and the United States is ready to spoil 20 years of  rapprochement with Beijing. Besides this, Clinton is not  contributing to the human rights cause, as if he demands respect  for the dignity of man he will not receive an answer, and if he  lets the case pass without further development he will be  consecrated not to be a champion of decency, but rather a weak  and timid leader.    One of the great problems for the Clinton administration is  that it has launched itself into a crusade to increase the  economy and guarantee U.S. jobs without minding the rest of the  world, on whom the trade guaranteeing American jobs depends. To  this we must add that Clinton was elected by a party that is  nothing more than a conglomerate of permanently conflicting  trends. A Democratic president must implement policies of human  rights, full employment, free trade, universal democracy,  government incentives for the industry, etc., and still lead  world affairs -- and all this within a highly ethical framework.  Few presidents have managed to escape this complex position,  and Clinton is no exception. Right now, in Washington and in  other capitals, those harmed and the enemies shout: Hypocrisy!  Allies and friends shout: Weakness!    It is difficult to reconcile what the Clinton administration  says with what it does. Washington is engaged in a real trade  war with Japan, which is, in fact, a closed market. One of the  battle fronts is the semiconductor market. U.S. chip producers  hold 43 percent of the world chip market and 20 percent of the  Japanese market, while the Japanese hold 42 percent of the world  market and 20 percent of the American market. Which market is  closed to whom?    The U.S. Government has now decided to subsidize the flat  computer screen industry with $1 billion. The pretext is that  portable computers are essential for the U.S. Armed Forces, and  the Japanese producers, who control this market, are reluctant  to sell to the U.S. Defense Department. Thus an entire U.S.  industrial sector will receive subsidies. These are not  subsidies masked as military research and technological  development, which afterwards return as products with civilian  applications, as the U.S. Government has always done it -- but  are direct subsidies for the installation of industrial plants  and a marketing system. It is not the first time the  electronics industry has received government aid. In 1987 the  government carried out the multi-billion Sematech program for  the development and consolidation of the chip industry. In those  days the U.S. strategic defense really depended on imported  chips, and the justification for government intervention in the  economic domain could be swallowed. Now, however, the objective  is simply trade: to increase the 3 percent U.S.-controlled  market share of flat computer screens.    The Argentines are now feeling the sour aftertaste of  retribution for having aligned themselves politically with the  United States. Once described by the U.S. Government as a model  example of trade deregulation, Argentina will now be included on  the black list of the disgraceful Super 301, because it did not  manage to approve an intellectual property rights law satisfying  the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. It must be pointed out that  the Argentine pharmaceutical industry is not big enough to  affect the international business of U.S. laboratories. The  U.S. policy now is to conquer every single inch of market, every  available cent, always flying the most noble banners. Ecology,  for example, has justified pressures on Brazilian shrimp  fishermen to use contraptions costing from $100 to $500 each,  which allow turtles to escape from the fishing nets. Is this  concern for Brazilian turtles? Perhaps. The fact is that the  United States is burdening Brazilian fishermen in the same  manner it burdened them at the end of the eighties, through  justified domestic pressure. Hypocrisy or weakness? Whatever  it is, it could cost Brazil dearly.</p>

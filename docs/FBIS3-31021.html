			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 10 Feb (TANJUG) -- Vojislav Seselj,  president of the Serbian Radical Party [SRS], said today that  the Srpska republic should totally reject yesterday's NATO  ultimatum. At a news conference Seselj stressed that the  radicals advocate negotiations and a truce with the Muslim side  on a reciprocal basis but NATO should not interfere.    "If the Srpska republic and the Muslim Jamahiriyah  [Bosnia-Herzegovina] agree on a cease-fire and the withdrawal of  heavy weaponry, such an agreement should be respected, but NATO  has no right to interfere," the SRS leader says. He welcomed  Radovan Karadzic's statement that everyone who talks to Serbs in  the language of ultimatums should consider the Austro-Hungarian  empire's experience.    Seselj said that the massacre in Sarajevo's marketplace was  staged by the Muslim regime and that it evidently demonstrated  that Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic is a "religious fanatic"  who does not think about human lives, as he wants to trigger  foreign military intervention.    In the event of an attack on Serb positions in Bosnia, the  SRS leader said, every Serb's patriotic duty will be to resist  this aggression. "We would regard such an attack in the same  way we would regard aggression against Serbia, Montenegro, and  the Serb republic of Krajina; in such a case the SRS would rally  all volunteers from the SRS and Serbian chetnik movement and  dispatch them to the territory of the Srpska republic." He  noted that in this event all interparty squabbling should be  relegated to the background.    Asked about his personal view, Seselj said that in the event  of an attack "one should pound all NATO's possible targets --  bases in Italy and other countries from which aircraft would be  operating -- as well as UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] troops."    "Air raids can achieve nothing. I believe this is how the  Serbs will react, whereas we radicals will take part in this  reaction," the SRS leader stressed.</p>

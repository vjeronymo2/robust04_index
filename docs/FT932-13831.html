			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / The Queen's Awards for Technological Achievement 1993: Compact breathing machines - PneuPAC KEEPING the patient breathing is an essential task of emergency rescue and hospital services, but respiratory devices are also needed at many outside locations where accidents and illness can suddenly disrupt people's lives. PneuPAC, the small privately-owned company which has won a Queen's technological award for its range of gas-powered lung ventilators, sells its equipment to industry (notably the mining, chemical, shipping, and leisure sectors) and the military, as well as to health and ambulance services in Britain and abroad. It claims to be the world's leading manufacturer of small gas-powered ventilators. There are actually four PAC ventilators. They are designed for use in rescue work (the simplest model), by paramedics, for treatment while in transport, and for anaesthesia in hospitals (the most complex model) where they are found in emergency rooms, intensive care facilities, recovery rooms, and operating theatres. About 40 per cent of pneuPAC's lung ventilator sales are made overseas, especially in Japan and Germany. The ventilators are very economical on gas use, using only 10 ml (millilitres) for every breath delivered. They are also compact, robust and shock-resistant, being designed to withstand tough and abusive use in difficult locations; each product has only one moving part, contained in the high stability pneumatic oscillator. PneuPAC says that its main competition comes from a higher priced German product. The pneuPAC ventilator system functions by first monitoring the patient's breathing to see if this is at an adequate level. If this is so, spontaneous breathing is maintained from a demand valve. If breathing becomes inadequate, then automatic ventilation is introduced, synchronised with the last spontaneous breath to avoid 'fighting' between the patient and ventilator. By means of a special high performance gas mixing device, 45 per cent oxygen can be provided over a wide range of parameters, thus reducing the demand for supply gases by two-thirds of that required by other products, pneuPAC says. This is especially important where cylinder gas supply is difficult to obtain or expensive. Set up in 1974, pneuPAC is part of a group of companies called Instruments and Movements which employs 300 people. Because pneuPAC makes its own component parts, it can combine advanced research and development work with the production of specialist products for unusual applications. For the lung ventilator range, pneuPAC first worked out the present and likely future needs of the overall market and then developed a range of new pneumatic elements to meet these.</p>

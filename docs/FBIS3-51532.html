You arrived in Washington  on the afternoon of 18 January and immediately after that you  visited the State Department and Capitol Hill. Can you tell us  about that, please?    [Reina] The meetings held yesterday were conducted in an  atmosphere of true cooperation between the United States and the  next Honduran Government. It was freezing cold when we reached  Andrews Air Force Base, and we were afraid we would have some  problems with the frozen runway. We met with Mrs. (Joan Spill),  who is the economic charge d'affairs in the State Department.  Afterwards we met with Senator Patrick Leahy, who was decorated  recently in Honduras and who has always had an excellent  attitude toward our country. At night, we attended a working  dinner, where I was very pleased to meet again with such good  friends as Francisco Aguirre, who is truly an institution in  Washington.    [Goldstein] Dr. Reina, we understand that this morning, your  agenda begins with a visit to the offices of the U.S. trade  representative, where you will meet the deputy official of that  organization and the official in charge of the Latin American  area?    [Reina] We will begin our agenda with a visit to (Charlene  Marshkenvitsky) at 0900. We will discuss Central American  economic prospects for the next quarter with (Mrs.  Marshkenvitsky) and [name indistinct], who is the assistant  secretary for Latin American affairs.    [Goldstein] President Clinton has issued a very strong  statement saying that he will seek a way to prevent Central  America and the Caribbean islands being affected negatively by  the signing of NAFTA with Mexico and Canada?    [Reina] I believe that that topic will be discussed soon,  and  the results will be the ones we expect: a rapid development of  the area. We will continue with a visit to the BID  [Inter-American Development Bank], and then we will have lunch  with BID President Enrique Iglesias, who was minister in Uruguay  during Julio Sanguinetti's administration and has deeply rooted  democratic principles. That is our plan for this morning.    This afternoon, we will meet with Senator Edward Kennedy and  Congressman Steny Hoyer, who are also strong supporters of  democratic governments in Central and South America.    [Goldstein] Dr. Reina, I would like to ask about the meeting  with Senator Kennedy and Congressman Hoyer, who is as  influential in the House of Representatives as Kennedy is in the  Senate. What do you expect to achieve in this meeting?    [Reina] I hope to get to know them directly, exchange and  compare views with them. We have always been linked with people  who have the highest democratic principles in Washington, and we  hope to revitalize those relations. I had the honor of meeting  John Kennedy, and I corresponded with Robert Kennedy. Now I  will meet with Senator Edward Kennedy, which gives me great  satisfaction and will be very beneficial for the rapprochement  between Honduras and the United States. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets: Paris marks time ahead of privatisation sales - Alice Rawsthorn assesses the mood of the French market after a spate of gloomy company reports For the next few weeks no-one, but no-one, will be watching the Paris stock market more closely than the new French government. Judging by the market's recent performance, the results will scarcely be scintilating. The government, desperate to raise capital to bring down the burgeoning budget deficit, is eager to start its long-awaited privatisation programme which could include the sale of as many as 21 state-controlled companies over the next two years. But the timing and scale of the sales will be determined by the condition of the Paris market. So far the signs are far from reassuring. The CAC-40 index, which was virtually static last year, has shown no sign of rallying in 1993. It ended the week at 1,859, barely above its 1,858 close at the end of 1992, and 1.5 per cent lower on the week. The primary reason for the market's sluggishness is the stream of pessimistic statements from French companies over the past month or so. For instance, Michelin, the world's largest tyre maker, announced it was implementing more lay-offs and short-time working. The car company Renault, a candidate for privatisation, warned of a sharp fall in first quarter profits, saying that it saw no prospect of early recovery. Elf-Aquitaine, another privatisation target, has also predicted a decline in interim operating profits. French companies had a tough time in 1992, when the problems of weak domestic demand were aggravated in the closing months of the year by the impact of the strong franc on exports. These difficulties have continued in the opening months of 1993 as France has slipped into recession. Meanwhile, the deterioration of the German economy casts a cloud over the prospects for exports to its largest trading partner. The recovery plan, launched last month by Mr Edouard Balladur, the new prime minister, has been well-received by the public. But the financial support for the flagging construction industry and small businesses, together with the FFr40bn (Dollars 7.2bn) special bond issue, are seen as stop gaps. They should, according to Mr Paul O'Brien, economist at JP Morgan, 'put more stimulus into the budget, but not enough to pull France out of recession'. There are some positive signs. Some French companies, particularly luxury goods and drinks groups, should benefit from the fledgling recovery in the US. The French franc is still strong, but it has been much more stable since the Balladur government's arrival in late March. The new administration has orchestrated steady reductions in interest rates  -with bank base rates falling from 10 per cent to 8.8 per cent since the elections - thereby alleviating the pressure on corporate borrowing and small companies. So far the rate reductions have had no tangible effect on consumer demand or industrial investment. The only signs of improvement are in the financial sector. Paribas, the prominent investment banking group, announced last week that the pressure on its lending margins had been alleviated, and highlighted signs of modest recovery in residential property. 'Eventually the reductions in interest rates will have a positive effect,' says Mr Michael Diehl of James Capel in Paris. 'We're now at a half-way stage where we're still waiting for evidence of recovery and French companies are still coming out with really gloomy news. As a result there's a certain amount of lethargy in the market.' The critical question is when will the market's mood change or, more specifically, when will it be in a suitable condition to absorb a stream of privatisation issues? At present the market is weak, but not disastrously so. There was enough enthusiasm among investors this week for Hermes, the luxury goods group, to stage a successful flotation on the second market. The issue, which raised FFr127.5m by selling 4 per cent of Hermes, was 33 times over-subscribed. The strong response to Hermes augurs well for next week's flotation of Naf Naf, the clothing company. However Hermes and Naf Naf are both relatively small issues. The real test for the market will be the forthcoming sale by the government of a stake of between FFr4bn and FFr5bn in Credit Local de France, the banking group, which will mark the start of the privatisation drive. The Credit Local sale, which follows the sale two years ago of a minority stake under the old Socialist partial privatisation programme, is scheduled before the end of this month. The market's response will be critical in influencing the timetable for the other state asset sales, expected to start in early autumn. Most analysts expect the market to continue in its present sleepy state through the summer; but the consensus is that it should at least have started to rally by early autumn. One reason is that, traditionally, the CAC-40 index is strongest in the final quarter of the year. Another is that, by then, lower interest rates should have had a beneficial effect on the economy. 'The market is fairly well underpinned,' says Mr Diehl of James Capel. 'It isn't overvalued and there's no serious risk of it tumbling down. 'The triggers for recovery will be the rising US dollar and falling French interest rates. They should have had an effect by the autumn, just in time for the government's privatisation plans to get off the ground.'</p>

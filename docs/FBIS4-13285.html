Israeli security  sources believe that such activity, if it continues, could have  political significance. [passage omitted]    The joint raid was directed against arms caches in a  Hizballah stronghold in the Ba'labakk area. Large amounts of  weapons, explosives, and drugs were seized. Over the past few  weeks, the Lebanese Army raided Christian strongholds several  times and detained several persons.

			<p>BFN     [Text] La Paz, 12 Jun (ANF) -- Minister of Government  German Quiroga has stated that the administration has $21  million to replace with other crops the coca plantations on  35,200 hectares in the subtropical region of Cochabamba  Department.    He explained that this investment is included in this year's  budget, and will be implemented provided the peasant leaders  allow it and do not oppose the voluntary eradication of coca.    Quiroga admitted that peasant union leaders are one of the  main obstacles for the Alternative Development Program, as they  are urging union members to oppose voluntary eradication in  order to obtain more benefits.    Government sources have explained that through alternative  development the Chapare -- Bolivia's top coca-producing region,  and the world's second largest -- will benefit from agricultural  development that will eventually replace the drug-driven  underground economy.    According to the sources, the products that will replace  coca  will be: bananas, pineapple, heart of palm, fodder, crafts, and  other profitable items.    According to information obtained from the "First Itinerant  Show: Bolivia Free from Drugs," at the end of November 1993 the  country had 47,200 hectares of coca plantations, that is, 35,200  hectares in excess of the 11,725 hectares needed to supply  traditional uses.    At that time the nation's overall production of coca leaves  from these 47,200 hectares was 82,800 tons, of which 71,075 tons  went to drug traffickers.    These figures will decline once the voluntary eradication  program is under way. The U.S. Government has offered to  contribute $20 million to the program if Bolivia complies with  the eradication target of 5,000 hectares.</p>

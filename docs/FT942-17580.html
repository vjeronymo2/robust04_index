			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / International Company News: La Generale posts 40% increase Societe Generale de Belgique, the diversified Belgian holding company, posted an increase of 40 per cent in its net profit last year. Total net profit for the group was BFr8.7bn (Dollars 1.5bn), up from BFr6.2bn the previous year. The group said that part of the increase in profit had been due to the sale last year of its 18.4 per cent stake in Union Miniere, the Belgian mining group, and 42.2 per cent stake in the cement group CBR. This had contributed to the BFr2.3bn of exceptional profits last year. But the improved performance of service companies such as Generale Bank, Tractabel and AG Group, in which Generale holds significant shares, had also contributed to its overall profit, the group added. Speaking in Brussels, Mr Etienne Davignon, president of the Generale group, was upbeat about the prospects for 1994, after a series of years which have seen the holding company prune a number of its financial assets. 'In spite of all the gloomy predictions, we estimate that the group could see in 1994 results at least as good as 1993,' he said. The group has proposed a dividend of BFr85 per share, against BFr84 last year, and a one-for-10 bonus share issue.</p>

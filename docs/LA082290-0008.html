			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GROUP FORMED TO BATTLE NFL 'SCRAMBLE'  </P> <P> More than 40 owners of sports bars and restaurants met Tuesday night in  Hillcrest to discuss strategies for contesting a lawsuit by Home Box Office and  fighting the threat by the National Football League to "scramble" its fall  telecasts.  </P> <P> They emerged from the meeting, which was also attended by eight attorneys, to  announce the formation of a new organization, the Assn. for Sports Fans'  Rights, which they hope will gain national backing.  </P> <P> "Tonight, all present agreed to join together to investigate options that may  exist, including rallying the customers of the bars and restaurants, as they  are the ones being denied the games," Norman Lebovitz, the owner of Sluggo's,  said in a prepared statement.  </P> <P> Lebovitz's comments came in reaction to a suit brought by HBO against the  owners of more than 30 San Diego sports bars for showing the recent heavyweight  title bout between Mike Tyson and Henry Tillman, via a Mexican satellite feed.  The suit, filed Aug. 8 in U.S. District Court, gives the defendants 20 days in  which to respond.  </P> <P> On Friday, the NFL stunned owners and customers of sports bars and restaurants  across the country by announcing it plans to scramble its telecasts beginning  with the first regular-season game Sept. 9.  </P> <P> Lebovitz said sports bars and restaurants are dependent on showing NFL games by  use of rooftop "dishes" that pick up the games as they're beamed from  satellites. The shock of the NFL's announcement was that no descrambling option  will be available.  </P> <P> "We didn't get the $3.6 billion the NFL got," Lebovitz said, referring to the  new four-year network television agreement, "and we're not about to lay down  and die. Many of us are dependent on these games for our livelihoods. Some  people will go under if this is enforced."  </P> <P> Lebovitz said the Assn. for Sports Fans' Rights plans another meeting next  week.  </P></p>

The newspaper quoted a Western source in Thailand. The  newspaper added: North Korean participation in the forum will  not be possible due to fierce opposition from the United States  and other countries. North Korea wants to participate in the  forum because it is uneasy with the fact that it is excluded  from the "Asian security framework."</p>

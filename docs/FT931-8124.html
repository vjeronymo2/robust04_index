			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Bank probed in Britain and US: Islamic Pan American Bank at centre of alleged Salvation Army fraud AN ALLEGED fraud that cost the Salvation Army Dollars 8.8m (Pounds 6.2m) is believed to be part of a much wider international fraud involving a mysterious Argentine bank under investigation by police and regulators in the UK and US for more than 18 months. The bank, Islamic Pan American Bank, has been the subject of British police investigation since the summer. The Federal Bureau of Investigation in Dallas, Texas, investigated the bank in July 1991 in connection with an insurance fraud which has since resulted in the conviction and jailing of a financier. The US Comptroller of the Currency, the regulator of US banks, said yesterday it had issued a formal warning on October 16 1991 that Islamic Pan American and an affiliate, identified as Eastech, may have been operating a banking business from Dallas, Texas, without authorisation. Both remain on the Comptroller's warning list. The Salvation Army - which has an income of Pounds 80m a year, of which Pounds 12m comes from public donations - filed a fraud complaint in relation to the loss of funds with the Metropolitan and City Police Company Fraud Squad. One of the most successful religious fund-raisers, the Salvation Army has remained silent on the affair as investigations have deepened, although it said one of its officers had been suspended on full pay. The affair only came to light when, earlier this week, the Salvation Army issued a writ to recover its money. The Salvation Army, in its writ, seeks the return of Dollars 8.8m from bank accounts which, it claims, were intended to be used in the purchase or sale of standby letters of credit. The writ to recover missing cash names the Islamic Pan American Bank, nominally headquartered in Buenos Aires, as one of a number of international banks and companies possibly holding its funds. A standby letter of credit is a guarantee from a bank to a customer that it will honour that customer's trade debts to a third party. They can be used as collateral to borrow funds or be traded. It is understood that the Islamic Pan American Bank was at the centre of a police inquiry begun after a UK importer, claiming funds under standby letters of credit provided by Islamic Pan American, found no trace of the bank. The importer had tried to collect the funds after a shipment of goods failed to arrive. Regulatory authorities in the UK and the Argentine police, through Interpol, were aware of the investigation. According to the July 1992 edition of the Bankers Almanac, Islamic Pan American is based in Buenos Aires with US offices at 6510 Abrams Road, Suite 300, Dallas, Texas. The telephone number for the address was contacted by the Financial Times. It was answered by a Mr Jim Burch of commodity traders Interfin. Mr Burch said he had lost Pounds 15,000 in a transaction involving an individual claiming to represent Islamic Pan American Bank. The Almanac says the bank has Dollars 286m capital. However, a regulator said: 'We do not believe all the information in the Almanac.' The Almanac also says that Price Waterhouse, the accountant, is the bank's auditor. PW said last night that Islamic Pan American Bank was not a client of either its Argentina practice or any other member firm in South America and that it would be investigating the connection claimed by the bank. The Buenos Aires address given in the Almanac appears to have been occupied by Arab News Agency, which is listed in the Almanac as a subsidiary of Islamic Pan American. Pinned to Arab News Agency's door is a notice saying that the office was closed down by judge's order on 17 October 1991. The solicitor acting for Mr Stuart Ford, one of the defendants in the Salvations Army's civil case to recover missing funds, said yesterday that Mr Ford denied any wrongdoing: 'His view is that everything will be sorted out to the satisfaction of the Salvation Army on his return (to the UK),' Mr Jim Crocker, of solicitor Howell and Co, said. The Salvation Army's writ accuses Mr Ford, Tilen Securities and Mr Gamil Naguib of 'fraudulently representing to the Salvation Army that they proposed to invest and/or had invested Dollars 10m . . . and/or the sum of Dollars 8.8m . . . in the purchase and sale of standby letters of credit.' The three are also accused of 'misappropriating' the Dollars 8.8m and using it for their own purposes. Mr Ford made at least two property transactions and it was these which led to the involvement in the affair of Edge &amp; Ellison, a leading Birmingham law partnership. Between three and four weeks ago, Edge &amp; Ellison received a telephone call from the Salvation Army, alleging that Mr Ford had absconded with its money. Edge &amp; Ellison acted for Mr Ford in the purchase of properties in Scotland and England.</p>

			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Baghdad recognises Kuwaiti sovereignty Iraq yesterday abandoned its long claim to Kuwait and recognised the United Nations-defined border in an attempt to pave the way for an easing of international sanctions, imposed after Baghdad's invasion of the Gulf state in 1990. The decision to comply with UN Security Council Resolution 833 was taken by the National Assembly and later endorsed by the Revolutionary Command Council. It came a month after the US and its allies deployed tens of thousands of troops, together with warships and aircraft, to counter a renewed Iraqi military build-up near the Kuwaiti border. In a statement released last night the Revolutionary Command Council, headed by President Saddam Hussein, said that Iraq 'recognises the sovereignty of the State of Kuwait, its territorial integrity and political independence'. Iraq also 'recognises the international boundary between the Republic of Iraq and the State of Kuwait as demarcated by the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Boundary Demarcation Commission. . . and respects (its) inviolability.' Initial international reaction to the Iraqi announcement was cool and early moves towards an easing of sanctions are not expected. The US said Iraq's recognition of Kuwait had to be in 'practice as well as in words' and warned that Baghdad had to comply with other UN resolutions before sanctions can be lifted. 'If that is, in effect, true in practice as well as in words, that is positive,' said Mr Dee Dee Myers, the White House spokeswoman, 'but there are a number of other elements in UN resolutions that Iraq must adhere to before we can even discuss lifting sanctions.' Senior US officials have previously emphasised that Iraq must comply fully with all aspects of weapons control and monitoring, account for all Kuwaitis transferred to Iraq during the occupation, and put an end to repression of the Iraqi people. Some diplomats have interpreted this as meaning the US will not support an end to sanctions while Mr Saddam remains in power. The UN Security Council meets on Monday to review the sanctions and British officials said yesterday they did not expect any action to be taken. However, Russia, which played a significant role in persuading Iraq to announce the recognition of Kuwait, is likely to press for some indication from the Security Council that it will react positively to Iraq's move. The National Assembly session in Baghdad yesterday was attended by Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister. France and China have also appeared sympathetic to rewarding Iraq as it edged towards full compliance with Security Council demands. But the French have taken a harder line since Iraq last month moved its forces close to the Kuwait border.</p>

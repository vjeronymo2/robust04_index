			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Survey of International Mergers and Acquisitions (9): Tough times for advisers - Too many investment banks are chasing too little business TIMES ARE tough for the international investment banks which act as advisers in cross-border mergers and acquisitions. There are simply too many banks chasing too little business. The volume of international M&amp;A business has fallen steadily since the late 1980s, putting pressure on the advisers to search for new business areas, cut their costs, compete more fiercely on fees and - in some cases - take on smaller deals. With the recession in the UK and the US, fewer companies have the financial clout to launch large aggressive takeovers of the kind seen in the 1980s. 'The level of activity generally is still much lower than before the Gulf crisis and the current recession', says KPMG, the accountancy and consulting group which compiles M&amp;A data. The quarterly average value of cross-border transactions in the first half of 1992 was Dollars 17.9bn, compared with Dollars 29.5bn in 1990 and Dollars 32.6bn in 1989. Not everyone is complaining. Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB), one of the top-ranking investment banks in the M&amp;A league tables, claims that activity  -as measured by the number of transactions and the overall volume - in the first nine months of this year is 'substantially higher' than a year ago. Other houses are not so cheerful. 'We are having to fight more aggressively for business because clients are ever more attuned to the possibility of using different advisers, and so they play the investment banks off against each other,' says the head of one large UK investment bank. 'Because of the business slowdown in traditional areas such as the US and UK, there are a lot of idle banks trying to get market share,' says Mr Francois von Hurter, executive director at CSFB. Investment banks have responded to the tougher climate in various ways. The most common has been to concentrate on new business areas where they can act as advisers. Much of the present cross-border M&amp;A business is focused on Europe as US and European companies are eager to strengthen their operations within the EC in preparation for the single market. Mr Bill Strong, who heads the European investment banking business at Salomon Brothers in London, says that many investment banks are concentrating on areas of core expertise. 'In Europe you will see a continued trend towards bank mergers and insurance mergers,' he says, as companies attempt to cut their overhead expenses, achieve economies of scale and sell their products using other companies' distribution systems. Investment bankers see plenty of scope for advising many of Europe's big companies on the restructuring of their businesses. For example, CSFB was appointed by the Swedish government to advise on the restructuring of two Swedish commercial banks - Nordbanken, which is state-owned, and Gota Bank, which had to fall on government promises to meet all of its obligations. Both of the banks have been hit by heavy credit losses. In the case of Nordbanken, CSFB is looking at ways of restructuring the bank so that the government can eventually sell it. 'With bank restructurings you end up with a sanitised bank which you can then sell,' says Mr von Hurter of CSFB. In addition, privatisations are expected to continue to provide a source of business for the investment banks. One of the important areas is the telecom sector, where governments sometimes want an injection of capital and a partner who can provide technological know-how and management expertise. The telecom companies in Mexico and New Zealand followed this route, and investment bankers expect further deals of this kind. 'Often the government is considering selling a minority stake, so there is an element of M&amp;A to it,' says Mr Strong. Much of the privatisation business is coming from eastern Europe. The advisory fees paid in such deals are fairly close to the level seen for western companies, advisers claim, although the deals often take longer to complete. Mr Strong of Salomon Brothers also expects to see investment banks increasingly being hired to advise governments on the financing of large infrastructure projects such as the construction of airports or rail links, particularly where these are partly owned and managed by companies in the private sector. While some investment banks privately claim that their rivals may be overstaffed and overdue for staff cutbacks, few will admit to taking such steps themselves. 'I think there is going to be a further fall-out in terms of head-counts' says Mr Strong of the investment banking M&amp;A sector as a whole. Another top banker says: 'There are too many banks chasing too little business - the ones who are good at it can find the work while the ones who are not well positioned will have to cut staff levels.' Some banks claim to have upgraded their M&amp;A staff while keeping the overall headcount steady. Others say they have been steadily building up their presence in Europe. Mr Richard Agutter, KPMG's head of M&amp;A, stresses that it is important to get a cultural knowledge of the various countries, given that 'Europe is not all one culture'. KPMG, which concentrates on advising the 'middle market' - or deals of between Pounds 10m to Pounds 50m - has been expanding its network across Europe over the last four years. CSFB, which also views Europe as a very important source of business, has opened offices in Budapest and Prague. Where the investment banks do sometimes admit to seeing tough competition is on fees. Advisory fees are seldom disclosed in Europe - in contrast to the US where disclosure is required. But advisers admit that the days of making fat fees are over. 'The days of making a big killing ended with the 1980s,' says Mr Agutter. In addition, some advisers are having to take on smaller deals than before in order to pick up enough business, although banks cannot charge the same fees for smaller deals. While investment bankers are hoping that activity will start to pick up in 1993, few believe that there will be a sudden, highly visible, recovery. Price-earnings ratios are generally seen as too high to encourage M&amp;A activity, and it may be some time before corporate profitability picks up enough to tempt the acquisitive.</p>

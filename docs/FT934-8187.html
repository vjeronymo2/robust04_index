			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Cold war polemic in Honduras: A look at 'communist' and 'fascist' insults between presidential candidates THE rhetoric of the cold war is over in most parts of the world, but not apparently in Honduras, where presidential, parliamentary and municipal elections are being held on November 28. The presidential campaign has been marked by the trading of vitriolic cold war era insults by the two leading candidates. 'The campaign is not addressing the issues; it has become a cold war polemic,' said Mr Guillermo Molina, a political analyst in Tegucigalpa, the capital. The candidate for the right-wing National party of the current president, Mr Rafael Callejas, is Mr Oswaldo Ramos, a former rector of the National University of Honduras. He has led an emotive campaign calling on voters to chose between 'communism and the fatherland'. He has accused his main rival Carlos Roberto Reina of the centrist Liberal party of having communist sympathies, saying that he and his brother Jorge Arturo are friendly with Cuban President Fidel Castro and former Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega. As evidence, Mr Ramos has been running advertisements on television and in newspapers showing a 1960 photograph of Jorge Arturo in Havana, beside the late Ernesto 'Che' Guevara, a hero of the Cuban revolution. Mr Reina, a former president of the San Jose-based Inter- American Court of Human Rights, has called Mr Ramos a liar, a fascist, and a danger to democracy. Opponents of Mr Ramos have alluded to his past membership of the Alliance for Progress of Honduras, an extreme-right wing organisation linked to the Unification Church. The Alliance was founded in 1983 by Gen Gustavo Alvarez Martinez, then head of the armed forces, who is accused by human rights groups of organising the 'disappearance' of several student leaders and union members. Mr Ramos, who comes from the more conservative wing of the National party than President Callejas, is known to have strong links with the powerful Honduran military. Most opinion polls have put Mr Reina at least six points ahead, but 30 per cent of voters are still undecided. Dissatisfaction with the traditional parties may lead to a better showing for the small Christian Democrat party and the Social Democrat Party of Innovation and Unity which between them won 3 per cent of the vote in 1989, say analysts. Mr Ramos has had the advantage of the support on the campaign trail of the personally popular and charismatic President Callejas, who is constitutionally prohibited from re-election. Since 1990 Mr Callejas has implemented a structural adjustment programme under the aegis of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which has brought economic stability and projected growth of 5 per cent this year. But there has been an increase in poverty, according to the School of Honduran Economists. When not insulting his opponent, Mr Reina has criticised the orthodoxy of the plan which he says he will renegotiate. 'What Reina represents is the critique to this model and its social consequences,' says Mr Molina. Some 2.7m Hondurans have been registered to vote in elections. The Organisation of American States finished revision of the electoral roll for the elections on Wednesday and has added 350,000 voters to the 1989 register.</p>

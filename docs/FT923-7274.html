			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Leading Article: More fiddling in Japan BELATEDLY, the Japanese Ministry of Finance has recognised that it cannot ignore the continuing collapse of the Tokyo stock market. But yesterday's rag-bag of short-term palliatives suggests that it still does not understand the severity of the crisis that Japan faces. The current financial turbulence could derail the economy for years rather than months. Until the Ministry of Finance publicly recognises this fact, it will continue to do more harm than good. Surely Japan's powerful civil servants should have realised by now that the stock market is not falling through the floor simply because a normal healthy recovery has been postponed for a quarter or two. Yet this assumption underpins yesterday's package. So long as the banks and other financial institutions can be dissuaded from selling shares to pay their interim dividends next month, goes the reasoning of the Ministry of Finance, then all will be well when the recovery arrives. Yet all will not be well. No amount of balance sheet manipulation can conceal the stock and property losses that the banks face, whether they choose to write them off now or at the end of the fiscal year, a fact that Japanese equity traders understand only too well. Nor will suspending the guideline ceiling on the percentage of profits that can be paid in dividends disguise the fact that the earnings outlook looks increasingly bleak. Bad debts have made the banks unwilling to lend and the sluggish state of domestic demand means that companies are unwilling to borrow or invest. That the health of Japan's banking sector is so closely tied to the stock market makes a serious situation doubly bad. Most banks would currently fail the requirement of the Bank of International Settlements that capital exceed 8 per cent of risk-weighted assets which comes into effect in March 1993. But making it easier to issue debt to meet these capital ratios will do nothing to stimulate lending. If the Ministry of Finance wants to ease the pressure on banks, it could do so directly by postponing the date at which the BIS rules become effective. Yet only economic growth can simultaneously satisfy the needs of investors, banks and companies. Moreover, the government is best placed to provide the necessary boost to domestic demand. Japan's general government budget surplus allows it plenty of room for an injection of at least Y12,000bn (Pounds 50bn) in spending and tax cuts in the forthcoming supplementary budget. Furthermore, while falling long bond yields have eased the pressure on the corporate sector, Japanese short interest rates are still higher than they need to be. Only by showing that it can act effectively can the government hope to stabilise the stock market. Yet it still prefers cosmetic manipulation to genuine stimulation. There can be few better ways to undermine the confidence of Tokyo's battered investors.</p>

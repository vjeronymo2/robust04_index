			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Pinhas 'Inbari] </F>   [Text] Israel is demanding that Syria make possible a  meeting between Foreign Ministers Shim'on Peres and Faruq  al-Shar'. It believes that Rabin's recent statements regarding  the evacuation of settlements from the Golan Heights justifies a  Syrian acquiescence in this issue. Such a meeting is vital for  convincing the Israeli public to accept the price of peace.    These messages are being relayed to Syria via the United  States. Israeli diplomatic sources briefed our correspondent  about some of the ongoing contacts. It is likely that Rabin  relayed similar messages via Russia as well.    According to the sources, Israel is not only demanding to  upgrade the talks, but also to open a secret, informal channel  of talks between trusted representatives of Rabin and al-Asad.    These talks are supposed to be conducted in the following  fashion: Suppose Israel withdraws from the entire Golan, what,  in your opinion, will Syria give Israel in return? This is what  the Israeli representative will ask his interlocutor.    According to the sources, Syria claimed it cannot open such  a  secret channel despite the fact that Israel believes talks  conducted without official minutes being taken are immune to  leaks. Syria has also differentiated between what it termed  "peace," and "the results of peace" -- thus expressing its  unwillingness to implement normalization immediately after the  agreements are signed.    As far as the withdrawal timetable, Syria is talking about  one year, whereas Israel wants the withdrawal to be phased out  over a 10 year period.    The sources said that tactical differences have surfaced  between the United States and Israel. While Israel is against  facilitating talks on the Syrian track as long as the talks with  the PLO are still going on, the United States is claiming there  is no connection between the two tracks and it is inadvisable to  wait until the agreements with the PLO are signed.    The sources claim this is the reason why Christopher  retracted his earlier decision to wait for the Israel-PLO  signing ceremony. They add he has no intention of intervening in  the Israel-PLO negotiations.    The sources noted that the date for the resumption of the  Washington talks will be determined only after there is an  agreement with Syria regarding the framework and the contents of  the talks.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Albert Kochetkov] </F>   [Text] Tbilisi February 22 TASS -- Supplies of drinking  water to homes have resumed in Georgian capital Tbilisi, and the  city's telephone exchanges, bakeries andother vitally important  services after a break caused by cuts in electricity supplies  since Saturday.    The Tbilisi thermal power station, the main suuplier of  electricity to the republic, is operating again, and three of  its ten power units will soon reach their capacity output of 500  kilowatt per hour each.    The director of the Tbilisi power station told ITAR-TASS  that  a special committe has been established to investigate the  causes of the breakdown. It may have been caused by the  overload of the Georgian power system, which is now cut off from  the power systems of the neihbouring Russia and Azerbaijan.  "This is why we cannot get hooked up to them in an emergency as  before," he said.    According to the director, the three power units can operate  now but two of them will be kept in reserve. The other seven  are worn out and need a capital overhaul, which can hardly be  expected to be made soon because of Georgia's severed economic  links with other former Soviet republics.</p>

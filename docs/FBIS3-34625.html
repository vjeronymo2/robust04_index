They simply ask, "Is this man for real?"  Washington- watchers in India are beginning to wonder whether  the question isn't apt for the President of the United States  himself.    The worrisome aspect of the scandal-prone Mr. Clinton, whose  policies abroad have been stumbling from one banana peel to  another, is that he is no longer merely simulating  India-bashing. It would be dangerously naive to ascribe his  weird words and deeds on South Asian subjects to his fabled  ignorance and immaturity in foreign affairs. The succession of  provocative remarks on Kashmir by Mr. John Mallot, Ms. Robin  Raphel and the President himself have never been retracted. The  clarifications that have followed India's protests have only  elaborated them further, confirming that the original assertions  were fully intended.    Take the latest calumny on Punjab for instance. Who accused  Mr. Clinton of having supported the idea of Khalistan? He  didn't say it, nor was he charged with saying it. Yet,  Washington has vociferously denied that the U.S. President had  provided tacit support to the cause of an independent Khalistan.  A Freudian slip there?    The U.S. clarification, however, makes it perfectly clear  that the Clinton Administration will determinedly pursue the  cause of "minority rights" in India. The "helpful"  clarification patronisingly emphasises that minorities in India  ought to have the same rights as the others.    Mr. Clinton would probably be shell-shocked to learn that  unlike the U.S., minorities in India not only have but also  exercise with gusto the same rights as the majority.    It was, therefore, in the fitness of things that India's  most  respected Sikh today, the Director-General of Punjab Police, Mr.  K.P.S. Gill, who has made the greatest contribution to the  return of normalcy in that State, was the first to ridicule the  U.S. President's observation.    Significantly, Mr. Gill's co-religionist, Youth Congress  president Maninderjit Singh Bitta, is organising an all-Sikh  demonstration outside the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi to protest  against Mr. Clinton's gratuitous observations. Such expressions  of outrage by the Sikhs, who are the sword-arm of Indian  civilisation, is the most appropriate response to Washington's  mischief-making.    According to sources in the Ministry of External Affairs,  the  Government, on the other hand, is not keen to react too  vigorously to Mr. Clinton's latest missive. "We have to learn  to live with the immaturity of the present U.S. Administration",  said a senior MEA [Ministry of External Affairs] official in a  resigned tone.    Pointing out that Indo-U.S. relations have witnessed many  ups  and downs over the last four decades, the official underlined  that it was during the Reagan and Bush tenure that New Delhi had  reached a most satisfactory political understanding with  Washington.    "The irony is that today, India's relations with the U.S. in  every other sphere, especially in the economic arena, are  excellent. It is tragic that we seem to be on different  wavelengths on political issues," he added. Indian officials  believe that an ill- informed U.S. President is being guided in  his South Asia policy almost solely by a very junior official,  his Oxford-mate Ms. Robin Raphel, whose personal predilections  have lent a definite tilt towards Pakistan. The stuffing of the  State Department's South Asia Desk with several officers who  have served in Pakistan is only enhancing the U.S. bias, New  Delhi feels.    South Block mandarins are also at pains to point out that  contrary to the obtuse angularities of the Raphelites, the  approach of senior U.S. officials like Mr. Peter Tarnoff has  been very different. Foreign Secretary J.N. Dixit established  an excellent rapport with Mr. Tarnoff during his visits to  Washington. But, sadly for India, it is Ms. Raphel who appears  to have Mr. Clinton's ear. What amazes officials here is that  the holder of the world's most powerful office has taken it upon  himself to reply to letters from all and sundry. At the height  of the Khalistan movement, several wealthy expatriate sponsors  of terrorism used to write similar letters to Presidents Reagan  and Bush. But they sent back only terse official  acknowledgements, without bothering to pen elaborate,  provocative replies like Mr. Clinton.    One explanation being offered for the U.S. President's  letter  to Congressman Gary A. Condit on "Sikh rights" is that Mr.  Clinton is in desperate need for Congressional support at the  moment. The Whitewatergate scandal is showing no signs of  abating and fresh revelations of Mr. Clinton's alleged sexual  peccadillos during his tenure as Governor of Arkansas, have left  him highly vulnerable.    Demands for a Congressional inquiry into his alleged land  deals and private life are snowballing. Recently, the inquiry  demand has become bi-partisan and the President's own party, the  Democrats, have joined the chorus.    Some U.S. Congressmen are well-known lobbyists for various  secessionist outfits and often champion all kinds of dubious  causes for a consideration. Being on the payroll of  organisations like the "Council of Khalistan" etc., these  Congressmen are expected to canvass their patrons' interests.  In his present beleaguered state, President Clinton can hardly  afford to antagonise any Congressman, even if his "cause" is  suspect. Thus, if a few words of encouragement give a  Congressman some pecuniary benefits, Mr. Clinton probably feels  it is worth it. The larger international ramifications  evidently do not bother him. At any rate, since India's-bashing  is now state policy, such replies do not go against the  diplomatic philosophy of the U.S. Administration either.    Keeping these exigencies in mind, India appears to have  decided against rising to Mr. Clinton's bait, at least for the  present. New Delhi has conveyed its strong feelings on the  subject to Washington through its Ambassador, Mr. Siddhartha  Shankar Ray, and does not intend to pursue the matter any more.    But there is all-round dismay that President Clinton's and  Ms. Raphel's ill-considered statements are periodically boosting  the morale of terrorists in Kashmir and the handful still left  in Punjab. Ironically, the very same Administration which  frequently goes into a tizzy over the "terrorism" of Libya's  Colonel Gaddafi and Somalia's General Aideed, is now directly  responsible for fomenting terrorist depredations in democratic  India.    But then, neither consistency, nor even adherence to self-  proclaimed lofty principles of freedom, democracy and human  rights, have ever been hallmarks of U.S. foreign policy.</p>

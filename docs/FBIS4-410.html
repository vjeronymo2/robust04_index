			<p>BFN     [Text] The situation remains quite calm here in Burundi  following the death of the head of state last Wednesday [6  April] in a plane crash, in which the president of neighboring  Rwanda was also killed.    This morning the chairman of the National Assembly and also  the chairman of the Crisis Committee addressed the nation and  thanked all the citizens for the calm and security that they  have maintained during these hard moments. Mr. Sylvestre  Ntibantunganya said this is the sign that Burundians are  determined to end the crisis which has paralyzed the country  over the past five months. He said the authorities are doing  everything possible to restore and maintain lasting peace.    The special representative of the UN secretary general to  Burundi Ahmedou Ould Abdallah also said the situation in Burundi  is far more encouraging compared to what is happening in  neighboring Rwanda. Mr. Abdallah expressed his satisfaction to  see that Bujumbura has become a platform for humanitarian  operations on foreign nationals living in Rwanda. [sentence as  heard]</p>

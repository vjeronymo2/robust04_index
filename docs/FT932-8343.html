			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Exceptional items to add Pounds 82m to C&amp;W profit CABLE &amp; Wireless, the UK telecommunications group, yesterday released a statement of exceptional items in advance of the publication of its annual results next month, showing a net contribution of about Pounds 82m to pre-tax profits. The City regarded the items as a clearing up exercise, but was more concerned by the lodging of a peso 10bn (Pounds 245m) damages suit against C&amp;W by Digitel Telecommunications of the Philippines for alleged failure to fulfil commitments under a joint project. There are three exceptional items, to be included in C&amp;W's 1992-93 results presented under FRS3 accounting standards, comprising a write-down of around Pounds 96m relating to its undersea cable systems, a profit of Pounds 60m from the exercise of warrants acquired in the merger leading to the creation of Telecom Hong Kong in 1988, and a gain of Pounds 118m from the sale last November of 20 per cent of Mercury, its UK domestic subsidiary. Mr James Ross, chief executive, said the unusual announcement was to give the markets 'a clear picture of our underlying trading performance'. It appeared to be partly a reaction to the unfavourable publicity attracted last week by British Telecom, which announced a larger than expected deficit on its pension fund on the day of its results. Analysts expect C&amp;W to report pre-tax profits of about Pounds 800m before exceptional items, up from Pounds 644m last year. The damages suit relates to a project to provide telephones in the Philippines. Digitel claimed yesterday that C&amp;W refused to pay its share of a deposit on a peso 40bn (Pounds 980m) project on Luzon Island. C&amp;W, which has a 27 per cent stake in Digitel, declined to comment.</p>

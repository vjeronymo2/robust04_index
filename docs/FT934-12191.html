			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / A city on edge as killings dull hopes for an end to violence: The mood in Belfast after the latest deaths BELFAST this week is living on its nerves, its population once again peering into the abyss. Since last Saturday, 14 people have been killed and more than 60 injured in an upsurge of political violence. An IRA bomb on the Shankill Road - killing 10 and wounding over 50, most of them shoppers  - has been followed by an intensified campaign by Loyalist paramilitaries to gun down Catholics indiscriminately. 'We just don't know where or who is going to get hit next. We are back where we were 20 years ago. I just feel like shutting up shop and leaving,' said a frightened woman owner of a newsagents on the Crumlin Road in west Belfast. Many shops in Catholic and Protestant neighbourhoods were shut yesterday, either out of respect for the funerals of six of the latest victims, out of fear of further trouble, or simply because their owners can no longer make ends meet. In some streets in the Protestant Shankill, and the Catholic Falls and Ardoyne areas of west Belfast, unemployment is higher than 50 per cent. Hard-faced young men hang around on street corners and watch armoured cars cruise past on patrol, while two army helicopters and an aircraft circling constantly overhead add to the sense of foreboding. A man on the Shankill Road watching the crowd gathering for the funeral service of five of Saturday's bomb victims said: 'We Protestants feel abandoned by the government. As long as the IRA can get away with atrocities like this there are going to be more and more killings by the Loyalists.' Hundreds of wreaths had been placed on the pavement outside the fishmonger's shop on the Shankill Road where the bomb exploded. Among messages of sympathy from friends and families, one had a more chilling message: 'With deepest sympathy from the officers and members of the Red Hand Commando,' the loyalist paramilitary group. A bulldozer was yesterday clearing the gap in the terrace where the shop had stood. On the side wall, a paramilitary plaque still hung in full view. It said: 'West Belfast Brigade Headquarters. Ulster Defence Association.' Less than half a mile away, over 1,000 people attended the funeral of Thomas Begley, the IRA man who planted the bomb and killed himself in the process. At one point, Mr Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, shouldered the coffin. Earlier this week, Mr Adams had said that he wanted the IRA to go into retirement. As one observer remarked, Mr Adams' action was as if to say that the peace initiative launched with Mr John Hume, the leader of the SDLP, just a month ago had also been pronounced dead. Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew said newspaper photographs had shown 'people in abject misery as a result of what happened in the Shankill Road, and today we see Mr Adams carrying the coffin, supporting one of those who did it'. Tomorrow, Mr John Major, the prime minister and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, will meet in Brussels to discuss the Hume-Adams initiative. Yesterday the mood in the working-class housing estates of west Belfast was not one of hopeful anticipation for what may be discussed in Brussels. Hopes here are simpler and narrower - that friends, family and oneself will not be the next victims. Adams condemned for carrying bomber's coffin, Page 8</p>

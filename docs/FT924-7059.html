			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / International Company News: Dayton Hudson figures reflect current trends in US retailing DAYTON Hudson, the fourth largest US general merchandise retailer with operations ranging from department stores to the Target discount chain, yesterday reported a sharp improvement in third-quarter profits, up to Dollars 57m from Dollars 35m in the same period of 1991. Earnings per share rose from 40 cents to 70 cents. The company said the advance reflected significantly better gross margins, as operating expenses improved and the mark-down rate became more favourable. These two factors offset the modest increase in same-store sales - up around 2 per cent for the group overall in the third quarter. During the quarter, Dayton's total sales were Dollars 4.34bn (Dollars 3.95bn), and the company is posting after-tax profits of Dollars 134m (Dollars 109m) for the first nine months of 1992. Dayton's figures seemed to confirm the prevailing trend in the US retail sector - modest underlying sales growth but more significant progress at the bottom-line, thanks to expense controls and other operational improvements. Yesterday, a pre-holiday season survey of retailers by Deloitte &amp; Touche echoed this message. 'Our retailer findings show some positive signs for this holiday season,' said Mr Irwin Cohen, con-chairman of D&amp;T's retail and distribution services group. 'Retailers have brought their businesses more in line reality over the last several years, but seem to have heightened expectations for this season as compared to prior years.' The survey - based on replies from 1,175 retailers - suggests that about two-thirds expect consumers will spend the same or more than last year. For November and December, about 41 per cent expect comparable sales and profits to be either flat or up to 3 per cent higher. However, about one-third of those polled think that results will be better than this. The most highly ranked business strategy aimed at combating competition over the holiday season was a tightening of corporate expenses. Next came a tightening of stock levels and third was increased promotional activity.</p>

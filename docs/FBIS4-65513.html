			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bosnia: Previti, Martino, on </F> Italian Peacekeepers"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 16 -- There was a chance that  Italian peacekeeping forces might one day take part in peace  operations in Bosnia but only if there were a unanimous request  to this effect from the United Nations, and always within the  framework of NATO, and in the presence of a bona fide peace plan  to be safeguarded and brought to a successful conclusion,  Italian Defense Minister Cesare Previti told journalists today  coming out of a meeting with Reginald Bartholomew, the United  States ambassador to Rome.    In response to a question, Previti said that in his talk  with  the American ambassador, Bosnia had come up only marginally and  was barely touched upon. The U.S. ambassador, however, took the  occasion to voice appreciation for Italy's "essential  cooperation" in NATO's initiatives in and for the former  Yugoslavia.    Turning to Italo-American ties, Previti stressed that the  long-time alliance between the two countries would continue  unfailingly in the future.    Meanwhile, out of Brussels, where the new Italian foreign  minister Antonio Martino was attending an EU [European Union]  ministerial meeting, the first signals were given that the  Berlusconi government would like to play a more active role in  the Balkan crisis.    Stressing that "the problem is very close to our interests",  Martino announced to his European colleagues that an Italian  diplomatic representation was imminently about to open in  Sarajevo and would be placed in the hands of ambassador Vittorio  Pennarola.    The minister did not rule out the sending in of Italian  peacekeepers "under certain conditions" to oversee, within a  NATO context, the implementation of an overall peace plan agreed  to by all sides. However, Italy's controversial recent  experience in Somalia led the government to want to be certain  that it had a say in all the relevant decisions before  committing peacekeeping troops to Bosnia, Martino said.</p>

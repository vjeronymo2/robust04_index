			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by radio correspondent Ahmad 'Ubaydat; from the </F> "With the Midday Events" program]    [Text] In a news conference held by Hasan Abu-Libdah,  deputy director general of the Palestinian Economic Council for  Development and Reconstruction, PECDAR, at the PECDAR  headquarters in al-Barid suburb, northern Jerusalem, Dr.  Abu-Libdah expressed the hope that all problems hindering the  payment of funds by donor states will be overcome within the  next few weeks so that the payments can be devoted to production  and work, and to set up the infrastructure and the  establishments of the Palestinian authority. He added:    [Begin Abu-Libdah recording] Since the signing of the  agreement, several quarters have raised Palestinian expectations  concerning what will come out of this agreement economically.  The donor states pledged more than $2 billion last October, and  renewed pledges of more than $643 million last January. Five  weeks after signing the agreement, we have received only $5  million deposited in bank account in Cairo to pay part of the  Palestinian police force's salaries. We signed an order to draw  nearly $6.5 million two weeks ago from the funds available with  the bank, and we have not received anything so far. We expect  to receive this sum soon.    Now the international community is being tested. Either we  cooperate, on both the Palestinian and international levels, to  realize the requisites for implementing this agreement and the  donor countries will fulfill their commitments, or we will  together witness the collapse of the peace process on the  Palestinian-Israeli level. The Palestinian National Authority  will not be able to carry out its duties in Gaza and Jericho and  meet its commitments toward the sons of our people in terms of  services and the expected economic progress -- it will not be  able to fulfill these commitments if it does not overcome the  budget deficit and if it does not receive enough support to  carry out a host of vital projects on which we have been working  for the last few months. [end recording]    Answering a question on whether the budget of the  Palestinian  Authority was endorsed by the Palestinian leadership, and how  much this budget is, Dr. Abu-Libdah said:    [Begin Abu-Libdah recording] Yes, the budget has recently  been endorsed by the Palestinian leadership. We are speaking  about a budget that begins with this month and ends late this  year. It is more than $360 million if we add the requirements  of the Palestinian police force to this budget. Without the  budget of the Palestinian police force, it will be about $220  million. Out of this sum, there is more than $126 million in  expected deficit. As for the police budget, the situation is  much worse than this. [end recording]    The temporary liaison committee of the donor countries will  convene a meeting in Paris next Thursday. The Palestinians will  present the Palestinian budget for 1994, which was worked out in  cooperation with the World Bank and the International Monetary  Fund.</p>

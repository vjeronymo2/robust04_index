			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / International Company News: Japan's steel groups hard hit JAPAN'S leading steel makers yesterday confirmed the severity of the downturn hitting the country's manufacturing industry by reporting declines in first-half profits of up to 85 per cent. All the leading steel makers warned that business conditions would not improve in the second half of this financial year despite the government's Y10.7bn emergency spending package announced in August. Sumitomo Metal said its pre-tax profit fell by 85 per cent from the first half of last year to Y3.32bn (Dollars 26.77m). Sales fell nearly 10 per cent to Y513.6bn. It said it hoped its recent stainless steel merger with Nippon Stainless Steel would lead to higher profitability in the second half of the year. Operating income fell by 52 per cent to Y27bn while net income was 73 per cent down at Y4.3bn. Despite the sharp fall, it is maintaining its interim dividend at Y3. Crude steel production was 4.8m tonnes, down from 5.5m tonnes in last year's first half. Nippon Steel, the country's largest steel maker, reported a 74.3 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y14.1bn, on a 6.5 per cent fall in sales to Y1,187bn. Nippon Steel produced 12.4m tonnes in the first half of the year, down 2m tonnes from the first half of 1991. It said the economy would be stagnant until next spring, with steel production sharply down. Kawasaki Steel's first-half pre-tax profits fell by 84 per cent. It said: 'The Japanese economy showed increasing signs of stagnation with private sector equipment investment continuing to decline and individual consumption falling into recession.' Its steel output was 11.6 per cent down at 4.9m tonnes, with sales down 5.5 per cent at Y559bn. Operating income was 61 per cent down at Y17.8bn, while net income fell to Y3bn from Y15bn last year. Kobe Steel's first-half sales dropped by 12.5 per cent to Y578bn, with pre-tax profits 75.4 per cent down at Y7bn. Operating income was 50.4 per cent down at Y29.7bn. NKK suffered a 55 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to Y6bn, largely due to a Y17bn increase in income from financial transactions, such as the sale of stocks and shares. Overall sales inched up by 1.5 per cent to Y605bn, but costs also rose sharply largely due to a change in accounting for construction projects. Nisshin Steel reported a 61 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y6bn, on a 5.6 per cent fall in sales of ordinary steel products.</p>

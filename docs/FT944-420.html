			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / 'Shift towards Asia' for steel towards Asia and away from central and eastern Europe - is forecast this week for the remainder of the 1990s. By the end of the decade, Asian countries will be consuming nearly 47 per cent of the world's steel, compared with 34 per cent in 1990, according to a study by Meps (Europe), the Sheffield steel consultancy. Over the same period, Asian production will have climbed from 31 per cent of the global total to nearly 40 per cent, it predicts. The forecast underlines the importance to the world steel industry of Asian markets, buoyed by increasing domestic demand because of strong economic growth rates. Production of steel in Asia is forecast to rise by 50m tonnes, or 19 per cent, to 316m tonnes between 1994 and 2000. China will account for the biggest share of the increase: its output is forecast to rise by 22.5m tonnes to 113m. The extra production will probably meet the higher demand for steel in China, says Meps, but it will remain a net importer of steel well into the next century. Production in South Korea will continue increasing, reaching 41.5m tonnes by 2000, while Indian steel production is also forecast to grow in the second half of the 1990s. New capacity is coming on stream in India and more is likely to be installed. Meanwhile, the Asean countries will all increase their production to meet at least part of the higher steel demand. New manufacturing plants for engineering products will create a strong demand for steel. Elsewhere, Latin America, South Africa, Iran and Australia will also increase their share of world production. The main loser, says Meps, will be the former Soviet Union, as compared with 1990. But even here, growth in output is expected from 1995, and many east European countries are already reporting increases in output. The traditional steelmaking regions - Europe, Japan and the US - will all have a lower share of total steel production in 2000, says the study. But the cake will be larger, as the consultancy forecasts a steady increase in global production from 727.5m tonnes in 1993 to 805m in 2000. It expresses confidence that 1994 will prove to be the low point in the cycle. Over the same period, finished steel consumption is expected to rise faster, from 615.3m to 715m tonnes.

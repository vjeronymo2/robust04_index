			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DO ANIMAL RIGHTS ACTIVISTS EAT MEAT?  </P> <P> It seems to me there are more pressing needs in our society for the anti-fur  people to pursue than passing out leaflets at theater openings and black-tie  galas ("Drive Is Mounted to Make Furs Extinct," Nov. 20).  </P> <P> Do they also protest leather jackets, shoes, handbags and belts? How many of  them abstain from eating meat? Why don't they also pass out cards in  restaurants that read, "Eating meat promotes the idea that it is acceptable to  kill an animal to appease the appetite. Please don't eat meat." It would appear  this zealous group is so intent upon foisting their beliefs upon others that  they even slip their cards into fur wearers' pockets . . . "discreetly," of  course.  </P> <P> LAMAE NORMINGTON  </P> <P> Anaheim  </P></p>

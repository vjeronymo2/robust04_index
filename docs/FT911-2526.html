			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Parties play down optimism over projected gains - Local council elections THE MAIN political parties are entering the finalstages of the local election campaigns deliberately playing down forecasts about the number of seats they will manage to win in Thursday's contest. Party strategists appear anxious to avoid building expections too high, so as to leave scope for claiming on Thursday that the results were better than expected. Instead, the Labour and Conservative parties are focusing on the main issues of the campaign, specifically the health service, the new 'council tax' and the economy. The government came under further attack yesterday after it indicated that the seven bands of properties under the new system of local government taxation could be changed - perhaps to take account of regional variations in house prices. Officials insisted, however, that the government's 'strongly preferred option' was not to increase the number of bands. Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, said: 'The dispute over banding goes straight to the heart of the government's problems. . . The new tax cannot both be fair and exempt well-off Conservative voters from large bills.' The Conservatives hold their final campaign press conference today. The part y chairman, Mr Chris Patten, and Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, are expected to pin blame for the high level of local tax bills squarely on high-spending local authorities. Labour will concentrate on the government's handling of the economy. The Conservatives are not making public forecasts about Thursday's results, but privately officials point out that the party is defending a number of seats it won in 1987, when the party was doing well nationally. Instead, Tory strategists prefer to make comparisons with last year's local elections when Labour was regularly far ahead in opinion polls. They also emphasise how well they believe Labour has to do if it is to have achance of winning the next general election. Labour is anxious, however,to distance itself from forecasts at the weekend that it was poised to gain 600seats. One official said that a gain of between 250 and 300 seats 'would suit us fine'. Similarly, for the Liberal Democrats, Mr Archie Kirkwood, campaign manager, said a 'neutral' result for his party would be a 'cause for celebration'. 'Looked at clinically and against our amazing successes in 1987, I think it is a very tall order to consider what progress can be made in this situation,' he said. 'I would not be surprised if we lost seats,' he said. However, he said his campaigners were confident that this was a pessimistic scenario. 'In the areas where we have done the work we will get the rewards,' he said.</p>

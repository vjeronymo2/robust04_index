			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 16 (XINHUA) -- China's foreign  exchange reserve has risen from 21.2 billion U.S. dollars at the  end of last year to 27.2 billion U.S. dollars at present,  Finance Minister Liu Zhongli said here today.    Speaking at a press conference, Li said that China has no  difficulty servicing its debt.    Liu said that China's state foreign debts amounted to 80  billion U.S. dollars, while its annual exports come to over 100  billion U.S. dollars. The ratio of its total debts to its  annual export value stands at 90 percent and its debt service  ratio, 7.6 percent. Both are much lower than international  warning levels. China has always had a good credit rating since  it began implementing an open policy, he said.    Though China will incur a domestic debt of more than 100  billion yuan this year, Liu was optimistic about a prospective  treasury bond issue to pay the debt.    He said last year's difficulty in selling treasury bonds was  caused by a financial disorder and an irrational fund flow.  After rectifying measures were taken, the financial order has  turned around.    This year, he said, the state will offer a preferential  interest rate on bonds and improve the methods of their issue.  Bonds will be mainly underwritten by dealers of financial  institutions. The state will also adopt measures to enable  individuals to trade bonds at any time. "Therefore, the issue  will go ahead smoothly," he said.    The finance minister said that China will adopt two measures  to reduce deficits. First, it will control the scale of capital  construction; second, the central government will increase its  revenues through implementing a newly-introduced  tax-revenue-sharing system.    However, it will be a long time before the government can  eliminate deficit. In two or three years to come, the scale of  domestic debts may remain relatively big, he admitted.    He also said that, as the bankruptcy law has come into  force,  banks have set aside bad-debt reserve to reduce financial  subsidies to enterprises running at a loss. But, the state  treasury will continue to subsidize those enterprises that  suffer losses because of policy reasons.</p>

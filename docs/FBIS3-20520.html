			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lu Keng (7120 6972): "Deng Liqun, a </F> Timebomb--Why Did Deng Xiaoping Visit Chen Yun?"]    [Text] Foreign wire services often come up with "marvelous  news." An example was a 12 January dispatch from Shanghai by  Japan's KYODO News Agency. It said: Top Chinese communist leader  Deng Xiaoping yesterday met with Chen Yun, a conservative  veteran and former chairman of the CPC Central Advisory  Commission.    It is said that KYODO obtained this information from an  informed Chinese communist source. The 11 January Deng-Chen  meeting lasted about an hour and a half. Chen Yun has been in  Shanghai ever since last summer.    KYODO added an extra remark to the report: What they  talked about is still unknown.  <H5>  A Two-King Meeting Is Rather Rare </H5>   It is a rare thing that "a king meets with another king."  One of the rules in Chinese chess is that the marshals of the  two sides cannot face each other directly. To do so is a big  taboo. No matter how a chess game goes, the marshal should  always be shielded by guards, ministers, chariots, horses,  artillery, or soldiers. He should not be exposed in such a way  as to appear face-to-face with the enemy's marshal. If he has to  do so, that means surrender.    Deng Xiaoping is the supreme leader of the Chinese  communists today. But in terms of "seniority," Chen Yun is above  Deng. The lineup of the standing committee members of the CPC's  Political Bureau elected at the Eighth National Party Congress  was: Mao, Liu, Zhou, Zhu, Chen, Lin, and Deng. As can be seen,  Chen held the fifth place and Deng the seventh. When the Third  Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee called for  "clarifying confusion and bringing things back to order," it was  Chen Yun who took the lead in saying that "Mao Zedong was a  human being, not a god." In addition, Chen Yun is a man with a  strong sense of principle. For example, in the 1988  rectification movement, the Organization Department of the CPC  Central Committee wanted to expel Li Rui, Li Chang, Yu Haocheng,  and Du Runsheng from the party. Chen Yun disagreed, thereby  preserving the party membership of these four people. However,  Chen Yun himself has a mentality based on "the orthodox  Marxist-Leninist ideology." He insists on taking the socialist  road and upholding the dictatorship of the proletariat. This has  given ultra-leftists a protective umbrella. Deng Liqun, known as  the "Leftist Lord," is still very arrogant today simply because  he has a strong backing--Chen Yun.    As the saying goes, "no one would go to the temple for  nothing." This being so, what was the purpose of Deng Xiaoping's  visit with Chen Yun? It appears that the visit had something to  do with the recent vigorous campaign on the mainland to mark Mao  Zedong's 100th birthday led by Deng Liqun.  <H5>  Mao Zedong's Soul Revives </H5>   Anyone with a discerning eye can see the main reason that  Mao Zedong's soul can revive and whip up a gust on the mainland  is the planning and manipulation by Deng Liqun. Take the  theoretical seminar in commemoration of Mao Zedong's 100th  birthday held in Changsha, Hunan, as an example. The sponsor was  the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, whose party committee  secretary is Wang Renzhi, a pawn of Deng Liqun. In name, the  seminar was held to commemorate Mao Zedong; in reality, it was  aimed at criticizing Deng Xiaoping. Its real purpose was to  criticize all those reform-and-opening advocates headed by Deng  Xiaoping for their divorce from Marxism-Leninism and betrayal of  Mao Zedong Thought.    Another example was the three-day "Contemporary Literature  and Art Seminar on Mao Zedong and China" held in Beijing,  beginning 22 December last year. This was a significant event  amid the activities to mark Mao Zedong's 100th birthday carried  out across the mainland. "Leftist Lord" Deng Liqun and "Leftist  Generals," including He Jingzhi and Lin Mohan, all attended this  seminar, whose theme was to hold high the banner of Mao Zedong's  Yanan Forum on Literature and Art and criticize the so-called  "unhealthy trends and evil practices" that had appeared with  reform and opening. The spearhead was also directed at Deng  Xiaoping.  <H5>  Young Deng Antagonizes Old Deng </H5>   Deng Xiaoping was, of course, unhappy about the acts of  respecting Mao in name and criticizing Deng in essence. He knows  clearly that Deng Liqun is acting against him. At present, Deng  Liqun's official title in the CPC Central Committee is merely  the "deputy head of the Leading Group for Party History  Research," but actually he is playing a commander-in-chief role  in controlling the whole ideological sphere. For this reason,  Beijing's intellectual circles, leftists, middle elements, and  rightists alike, all see him as the "underground general  secretary of the Chinese Communist Party."    Perhaps, someone may ask: How can Jiang Zemin, general  secretary of the CPC Central Committee, turn a blind eye and a  deaf ear to this? The answer is that Deng Liqun planted his men  long ago on the theoretical, propaganda, and cultural work  fronts. These people have long been accustomed to implementing  Deng Liqun's instructions and styling themselves as protectors  for Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought. They overtly obey but  covertly oppose all other instructions; the only thing they  really follow is Deng Liqun's order. And, in the eyes of the  "Left Lord" and "Left Generals," Deng Xiaoping's "socialism with  Chinese characteristics" is "sham" socialism but "real"  capitalism.    Confronted with this challenge, Deng Xiaoping, of course,  wanted to fight back. The best strategy was to "deprive the  opponent of backing." In view of the fact that he and Chen Yun  had shared the same view about Mao Zedong's nation-devastating  Cultural Revolution, it would appear that only by obtaining Chen  Yun's concurrence could he now suppress Deng Liqun's arrogance  and stop the frantic Maoist wind, which would be no good to all  if allowed to blow unchecked.  <H5>  Chen Yun Supports Deng Liqun </H5>   Deng Xiaoping is adept at employing the outflanking  tactics. If the KYODO report on the Deng-Chen meeting in  Shanghai is true, the only explanation is that Deng Xiaoping  hoped to have another round of cooperation with Chen like the  one resulting in the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC  Central Committee. This cooperation would prevent Deng Liqun and  his ilk from continuing their all-out efforts to stir up left  winds.    Nonetheless, Chen Yun, who has always styled himself as an  orthodox Marxism-Leninism protector, may, in all probability,  appreciate Deng Liqun's strategy of using dead Mao to curb  living Deng. In no way would he agree with old Deng if the  latter wanted to subject young Deng to disciplinary action!  Then, how come Deng Xiaoping, who is so wise, tried to seek such  a rebuff for himself?    It seems that only Mao Mao [Deng Xiaoping's daughter and  author of "My Father Deng Xiaoping"] can truly answer this  question.    A view shared by Chinese and foreign observers alike is:  After Deng Xiaoping's death, China will not fall into great  disorder, but inevitably a strong quake will take place in the  CPC's central leadership because too many bombs are buried  around Zhongnanhai.    Deng Liqun is a very destructive timebomb. Though he has  no gun in hand, he is self-assured because he has the Marxist  theory as his invincible weapon.</p>

			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Arts: Arts Council shares out its meagre Christmas presents The Arts Council distributed Christmas presents yesterday in the form of 1993-94 grants to its shrinking group of clients, and managed to share out the misery fairly equally. The Council's grant from the government of Pounds 226m was a mere 2 per cent increase over the current year, but by cutting its operating overheads to the bone, it has managed to give some clients slightly more than that. The Big Four - the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden (with Pounds 19.5m), the RSC, (Pounds 8.47m); the Royal National Theatre (Pounds 11.16m) and the ENO (Pounds 11.65m) - get a 2.5 per cent rise in grant: indeed there is a even a little addition for Birmingham Royal Ballet. The South Bank receives a 2 per cent lift to Pounds 13.42m. The conclusion of successful funding deals with local authorities has ensured more substantial grant increases for the Birmingham Rep (up 10.2 per cent); the Belgrade Coventry (9.6 per cent); and Watford Palace (a 13.6 per cent gain) while the Hampstead Theatre in London gets a rise of 17.5 per cent to Pounds 234,400, thanks to a recent Arts Council appraisal. In contrast, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra is frozen at Pounds 440,000 while the Council waits to see how its new management team works out. The Bournemouth Orchestras (6.9 per cent more at Pounds 1.48m) and the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic (6.9 per cent extra to Pounds 1.48m) gain because they face particular challenges next year. The LPO benefits by 6.3m, to Pounds 1.13m, to ease its residency at the South Bank. Dance seems favoured, with substantial gains for Northern Ballet Theatre (up 7 per cent to Pounds 879,800) and for the companies led by Siobhan Davies and Shobana Jeyasingh. The Arts Councils of Scotland and Wales receive just 2 per cent more. The fight is now on to raise the Government allocation for 1994-85 which, at the moment, is set to be a reduced grant.</p>

			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Japan under pressure The Clinton administration scarcely needs to talk the yen up. The mere expectation that it would do so after the failure of the latest bilateral trade talks saw the currency rise by nearly 4 per cent against the dollar in Europe yesterday. Yet such a knee-jerk reaction is not entirely rational. That became clear in the afternoon when the strength of the movement prompted fears the Federal Reserve might even intervene to drive the yen down again. It did so last August when the dollar approached Y103. A strong yen may be a convenient way of putting trade pressure on Japan, but last year's intervention suggests even the US authorities acknowledge it is a mixed blessing. A quick glance at the Tokyo stock market's response is a reminder of how the deflationary impact quickly offsets the benefits of fiscal economic priming. A strong yen may price Japanese exports out of overseas markets but that will do nothing to boost corporate earnings, employment and therefore consumer confidence within Japan. There is little chance of import volumes rising if the yen is too high to allow the economy to recover. The US may thus have little ultimately to gain by turning the currency market into a trade battlefield. Nor would the tactic necessarily succeed for long. Strip away trade politics and the fundamentals are poor for the yen. The US economy is recovering and interest rates have begun to rise. Japan is still in recession; rates may fall again. The current account surplus is falling in yen terms and is anyway offset by strong capital outflows. These would only increase if a strong yen made investment at home even less attractive.</p>

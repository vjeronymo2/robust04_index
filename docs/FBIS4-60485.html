The delegation comprised representatives from  the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the  Confederation of Indian Industry, and ASSOCHAM [Associated  Chamber of Commerce].    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Indian  businessmen have termed their visit to the U.S. as highly  successful. They feel that the meetings with the U.S. officials  and businessmen has helped them to have a free and frank  exchange of ideas that will give a major fillip to existing  bilateral trade ties. American businessmen have shown special  interest in investing in the energy, communications, banking,  and financial sectors. Besides areas of infrastructure and  consumer durables, a major attraction for the U.S. industry is  the large untapped market of 200 million consumers and a growing  industrial sector with an insatiable appetite for technology and  infrastructure. India's highly skilled class of  English-speaking professionals and scientists was another  attraction for the U.S. investors.    [Unidentified business leader] The Confederation of Indian  Industry signed a memoranda of understanding [MOU] with the  National Association of Manufacturers of USA, and this MOU would  now really formalize our relationship, which would address the  subject of increasing business cooperation involving small and  medium-size enterprises in U.S. because large multinational  organizations are present here and are reasonably well informed,  but the small and medium where there is a tremendous opportunity  and this MOU would enable us to focus on that task.

Converter dolly has the same meaning as in 49 CFR 393.5.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Truck tractor-beverage semitrailer combinations shall have the same access to points of loading and unloading as 28-foot semitrailers (28.5-foot where allowed by &sect;658.13) in 23 CFR 658.19.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 11. In &sect;658.17, paragraphs (f), (g), and (h) are redesignated as paragraphs (g), (h), and (i), respectively; new paragraphs (f), (j), and (k) are added; and redesignated paragraph (h) is revised. Paragraphs (f) through (k) now read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;658.17  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Weight.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (f) Except as provided herein, States may not enforce on the Interstate System vehicle weight limits of less than 20,000 pounds on a single axle, 34,000 pounds on a tandem axle, or the weights derived from the Bridge Formula, up to a maximum of 80,000 pounds, including all enforcement tolerances. States may not limit tire loads to less than 500 pounds per inch of tire or tread width, except that such limits may not be applied to tires on the steering axle. States may not limit steering axle weights to less than 20,000 pounds or the axle rating established by the manufacturer, whichever is lower.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) The weights in paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section shall be inclusive of all tolerances, enforcement or otherwise, with the exception of a scale allowance factor when using portable scales (wheel-load weighers). The current accuracy of such scales is generally within 2 or 3 percent of actual weight, but in no case shall an allowance in excess of 5 percent be applied. Penalty or fine schedules which impose no fine up to a specified threshold, i.e., 1,000 pounds, will be considered as tolerance provisions not authorized by 23 U.S.C. 127.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) States may issue special permits without regard to the axle, gross, or Federal Bridge Formula requirements for nondivisible vehicles or loads.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The provisions of paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section shall not apply to single-, or tandem-axle weights, or gross weights legally authorized under State law on July 1, 1956. The group of axles requirements established in this section shall not apply to vehicles legally grandfathered under State groups of axles tables or formulas on January 4, 1975.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j) The provisions of paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section shall not apply to the operation on Interstate Route 68 in Allegany and Garrett Counties, Maryland, of any specialized vehicle equipped with a steering axle and a tridem axle and used for hauling coal, logs, and pulpwood if such vehicle is of a type of vehicle as was operating in such counties on U.S. Routes 40 or 48 for such purposes on August 1, 1991.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (k) Beginning October 6, 1992, and ending October 5, 1994, the provisions of paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section shall not apply to any vehicle which is regularly and exclusively used as an intrastate public agency transit passenger bus. The Secretary may extend this temporary exemption for an additional year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. In &sect;658.19, paragraph (a) is revised to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;658.19  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Reasonable access.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) No State may enact or enforce any law denying reasonable access to vehicles with dimensions authorized by the STAA between the NN and terminals and facilities for food, fuel, repairs, and rest. In addition, no State may enact or enforce any law denying reasonable access between the NN and points of loading and unloading to household goods carriers, motor carriers of passengers, and any truck tractor-semitrailer combination in which the semitrailer has a length not to exceed 28 feet (28.5 feet where allowed pursuant to &sect;658.13(b)(5) of this part) and which generally operates as part of a vehicle combination described in &sect;&sect;658.13(b)(5) and 658.15(a) of this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

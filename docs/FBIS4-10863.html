			<p>BFN     [Text] EL PERUANO was able to establish that the struggle  against drug trafficking in the Upper Huallaga could be more  effective if the helicopters the Air Police use in the thick  jungle areas were equipped to fly at night.    This is because of the new tactic used by Colombian drug  traffickers who land their modern aircraft at night, taking  advantage of the fact that police aircraft do not have night  vision devices to detect them and react immediately.    An Air Police member commented: "When we started our  antinarcotic operations in the Upper Huallaga we struck hard  blows against drug trafficking but all these operations were  carried out in the daytime. Now the Colombian traffickers carry  out their operations at night, which complicates matters for us."    In addition to limited operational capacity are the  helicopters' years of service. In the 60's, the UH-1  helicopters played an important role in the Vietnam war due to  their great maneuverability and their capacity to escape unhurt  from the most incredible war situations.    However, 30 years later, it can be said that the UH-1  helicopters have completed their operational cycle. Therefore,  those operating in the Upper Huallaga must be replaced.  Accidents have occurred, but the Peruvian police pilots' skill  has prevented greater disgraces.    Another member of the force said: "We need training to  operate at night with night vision devices, because this would  make our work more effective. If we had this our actions would  certainly seriously wound this illegal trade."    This policeman has every right to say what he said because  the information supplied by the silent DEA aircraft, which  operates with its turbines off in the middle of the night in the  jungle, cannot be used by the Peruvian pilots because their  aircraft only fly during the day.    Although this has by no means affected police pilots'  morale,  neither can it be said that their effectiveness is minimal.  Facts prove it: The results would be much more significant if  only they were to operate under other conditions.</p>

			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FUMBLING ON AIDS CAUSES WASTE, SUFFERING  </P> <P> Los Angeles County's health-care system is increasingly unable to meet the  needs of those who use it. People experience long waits for initial visits to  outpatient clinics. It is not uncommon for a hospital patient to spend up to  three days lying on a gurney in a hall until a bed becomes available. The  system does not employ sufficient bilingual staff, so people who speak a  language other than English often have difficulty gaining access to medical  services. However, since we are most familiar with the problems of people with  AIDS and AIDS-related illnesses who must use the public health facilities, we  will speak specifically to their problems.  </P> <P> The county has yet to comprehensively address the AIDS epidemic in a medically  sound, fiscally responsible and compassionate manner. As a result, people are  dying in unnecessary pain and emotional agony. With one-third of all people  with AIDS and AIDS-related illnesses relying on this system, it is no surprise  that they receive substandard care.  </P> <P> For years, the breakdown of the county's public health-care system has been  obvious. Why have our public officials chosen to do nothing about it? When  their inaction is criticized, they become defensive and reactive rather than  creative and responsive.  </P> <P> Who is in charge here? Nobody, it seems. The Board of Supervisors relies on  whatever information or misinformation our county Department of Health Services  provides. The Department of Health Services hides behind very real and enormous  problems in the public health-care system instead of providing positive and  constructive solutions. Monies are provided but not spent; $8.6 million go  unused in this year's county AIDS budget. Services continue to go unprovided,  facilities unrehabilitated, staff unrecruited and more patients continue to  suffer and die needlessly.  </P> <P> Since the epidemic began nine years ago, the county's only major organized  response has been to open an outpatient clinic, which has proved grossly  inadequate. It is so overburdened that one must wait eight weeks for an initial  visit. People with temperatures of 103 or higher sit for hours on hard wooden  benches waiting for help. Some receive chemotherapy in crowded hallways,  vomiting in bags. Others in the same hallways, stripped to the waist, have IVs  hooked to their arms. A caring staff does its best amid these poor conditions.  </P> <P> Faced with the harsh reality of the outpatient clinic and with the lack of a  dedicated AIDS ward and other health-care services, AIDS activists organized a  grass-roots campaign to bring about sorely needed change. In 1988 a series of  protests were organized to bring pressure on the Board of Supervisors and on  the county Department of Health Services. The outcry was heard but the response  meager: a 20-bed AIDS research ward to open sometime in 1990. The planned ward  is already obsolete in the face of a current average daily census of 60  hospitalized patients with AIDS and AIDS-related illnesses.  </P> <P> California's Department of Health Services recently reported that during 1988  the state Medi-Cal program spent twice as much money per AIDS patients in Los  Angeles as it did for those in San Francisco. This is due primarily to the  extended hospital stays that occur in Los Angeles: 13.3 days against 9.5 days  in San Francisco. The report is an indictment of poor patient management,  resulting in part from the lack of a dedicated AIDS ward in this county's  public hospital system. Studies have shown, and the experience of private  hospitals in Los Angeles has proved, that the length of hospital stay for  patients in AIDS wards is shorter than for AIDS patients dispersed in the  general hospital population. Health-care systems in other cities have a range  of health care for people with AIDS and AIDS-related illnesses, which includes  dedicated AIDS wards, outpatient clinics, early intervention prevention  programs, hospices and home health-care programs.  </P> <P> Are we in Los Angeles entitled to anything less? Yes, according to our  Department of Health Services and Board of Supervisors. No, according to  community groups who participated in the recent weeklong AIDS vigil at  County/USC Medical Center. In the rain and cold, the community demanded a  50-bed AIDS ward, improved outpatient services, a comprehensive countywide AIDS  health-care plan, access to the treatments and health monitoring routinely  available under private care, and full disclosure of the possible health risks  in county drug-research protocols.  </P> <P> We are in the midst of an epidemic that will take us beyond the year 2000.  While it should be practicing 21st-Century medicine, this county's health-care  system continues to function in a 19th-Century modality in early 20th-Century  facilities. The Board of Supervisors has shown itself incapable either of  meeting the county's immediate health-care needs or of anticipating those of  the future. The county Department of Health Services must cease its arrogant  posturing and be willing to provide what is needed in terms of public health.  The supervisors must meet their obligation to provide for the public health and  insist that those they have hired to do that job do it and do it well.  </P></p>

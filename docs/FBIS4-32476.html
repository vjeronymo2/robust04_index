			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Intelligence Agency -- Clean"] </F>   [Text] Yesterday, the Parliament Committee for control  over the work of the State Intelligence Agency announced the  results of its surveillance of the agency documents. The  Committee confirmed the intelligence service had not undertaken  any operative or technical methods towards VMRO-DPMNE [Internal  Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Party for  Macedonian National Unity], nor towards any other political  party. The document presented to the public by Ljupco  Georgievski is a forgery, as there is no original or any other  document in the intelligence documentation under that number and  date. The intelligence does not undertake measures and methods,  but on individuals connected with foreign intelligence services  or because of activities aimed at endangering the constitutional  establishment of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM], the Committee report states.</p>

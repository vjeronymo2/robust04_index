			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Choe Tu-sam from Beijing] </F>   [Text] A Western diplomatic source in Beijing revealed on  17 May that recently North Korea requested that all members of  the liaison delegation of the Chinese side of the Military  Armistice Commission [MAC] withdraw and return to China. North  Korea is at odds with China, which opposed such a request.    This source said that before proposing to the United States  to replace the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement, North  Korea officially requested in April that all five Chinese  members of the liaison delegation, including a colonel-level  senior delegate of the Chinese People's Volunteers liaison  office of the DPRK-China side of the MAC, be withdrawn because  "the historical duty of the Armistice Agreement has ended."    The Chinese side replied: "China would be making a big  historical mistake if the Chinese side withdrew from the MAC  when it has not been abolished." The Chinese side points out  that it is trying to persuade North Korea, but it is being  stubborn; therefore, China is in an awkward position.    While the Chinese side is hesitating to withdraw  unilaterally  from the MAC, North Korea proposed to the United States to  replace the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement late last  month and thus withdrew its MAC members to Pyongyang.</p>

			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Arts: Crisis in the Commonwealth - The Institute, cultural showcase for the nations of the former British Empire, seems set to go the way of the Empire itself Monday is Commonwealth Day but at the concrete pavilion of the Commonwealth Institute in Kensington, celebrations will be muted. Commonwealth secretary-general, Chief Emeka Anyaoku, will host a reception for a host of sporting celebrities, but their hearts will not be in it. For the Institute, set up in 1958 as the cultural showcase for the nations of the former British Empire, seems set to go the way of the Empire itself. The arts and educational centre, which houses 12,000 artifacts from more than 50 nations, is to lose its entire Pounds 2.7 million subsidy from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. 'The news came nine days after our development report was published, which we were feeling very pleased with, so the effect was devastating,' says Stephen Cox, director-general of the Institute. 'It's been a very miserable time.' Cox has prepared an 11th-hour proposal for the venue's survival and made half his staff of 90 redundant, including his deputy, in an attempt to wring a reprieve from the foreign secretary, Douglas Hurd. If the FCO comes up with Pounds 1m a year, says Cox, he will earn the rest: 'We have got, and are developing very rapidly, a good conference and events centre here which is beginning to make money in quite substantial amounts'. The Institute has always had its detractors, who question the value of wood carvings and masks of dubious historic or aesthetic interest or permanent exhibits depicting New Zealand cheesemaking. 'The building itself is unforgiveably ugly and inside, it is designed to confuse,' says the art critic Brian Sewell. 'The temporary exhibitions have been unmitigated drivel for the last 20 years. The work is often by really wretched people who wouldn't have even got into art school in this country. The artifacts are just tourist trade rubbish. It is a slave of and monument to political correctitude.' Supporters, however, point to the record of the institute's main gallery, which has housed exhibitions by significant artists including the Guyanese painter, the late Aubrey Williams, and to a series of much-praised readings by Caribbean poets. Last year, more than 50,000 British schoolchildren visited and Cox asserts that behind the music, dance, paintings and tableaux of 'life in many lands' the Institute has a serious role: 'Britain is a multi-cultural society and the context and reason for that is predominantly a Commonwealth one. If we fail to ensure that context is maintained so that people understand it, then I think we are left with the problems of the East End of London and the British National Party washing over us. The Commonwealth is essentially an organisation working towards eliminating racial prejudice.' He is seeking private sector partners for a Pounds 5m proposal to transform the interior of the building to become a tourism draw with an underlying ecological message. On the ground level would go World of Wonders, a dramatic virtual reality presentation of natural phenomena like tropical storms, volcanic eruptions and Arctic chill; on the second level would be a computer-driven information complex on the 50 Commonwealth states; and on the third a temporary exhibition area. Under-funding over the years means the listed building - designed by the architects of the Royal Festival Hall - has been badly neglected and Cox acknowledges that a rethink of the displays is long overdue. 'One thing I've never doubted is that the Commonwealth and the Institute have an important job to do.' Generally, he says, 'we have attracted very little criticism though we're working in some sensitive areas - the projection of international understanding, of Commonwealth values, the development of the multi-cultural society in Britain. These areas can become very difficult.' But surely, with ex-dominions like Canada and Australia now globally equal with Britain, and at least one of them going briskly towards renouncing the monarchy, the association of these former Empire states is an anachronism. Not to Cox. 'The Commonwealth is the only multilateral organisation,other than the UN, covering a quarter of the world's land surface and a quarter of the world's population. It's the only other organisation which combines rich and poor, developed and developing, the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans.' Australia may be going republican, but it is pro-Commonwealth; Hong Kong may leave, but South Africa would like to rejoin. And London is the headquarters of the Commonwealth, with the Institute its vital cultural showcase. Brian Sewell, however, remains unconvinced. 'It has been the most fatuous exercise since it began. And as the Commonwealth nations are pulling away, what is the point of keeping the Commonwealth Institute open?'</p>

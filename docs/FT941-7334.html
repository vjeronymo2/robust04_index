			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Broker urges cut in whisky output A cut in Scotch whisky production of between 5 per cent and 7 1/2 per cent this year is needed to reduce a damaging surplus of stock, says a report published today. It says output must fall for the fourth consecutive year, although the reduction need not be as severe as the 15 per cent cut made in 1993. Mr Alan Gray, the report's author, expects this cut to bring stocks largely into line with consumption, although production will need to be held at the lower level through 1995. Mr Gray is a whisky analyst with Sutherland &amp; Partners, the Edinburgh securities house. Whisky distillers have been hit by falling demand for four years, but the market recovered slightly last year, and further improvement is expected this year. Sutherland says whisky exports increased last year in spite of recession in many overseas markets, with exports of Bottled in Scotland blends up 2.7 per cent by the end of November. Total exports were more than Pounds 2bn for the first time, maintaining Scotch whisky's position as one of the UK's most important exports. Scotch Whisky Industry Review 1993. Sutherland &amp; Partners (Edinburgh), Saltire Court, 20 Castle Terrace, Edinburgh EH1 2EY. Pounds 295.</p>

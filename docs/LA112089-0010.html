			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAUDIS SECRET STAKE IN MARINA  </P> <P> Although Saudis secretly obtaining large interests in Marina leases with the  blind approval of the Board of Supervisors offends me, it most certainly does  not surprise me. With possibly one exception, this board almost invariably  represents interests of big money -- not the electorate.  </P> <P> It angers me that the citizens of the county continue to tolerate the board's  cozy relationship with land developers (desecraters is a more descriptive term)  merely because they, and other fat-cat moneyed interests contribute much more  to campaign funds than can the average voter.  </P> <P> It is high time the voters of Los Angeles County demand a return in the  governance of the county. Such reform should begin with increasing board  membership to at least nine members. Such a size increase would insure more  equitable representation.  </P> <P> A second step should be a separation of powers. Five men should not have total  control over all county functions and decisions. At the very least, legislative  and executive powers should be separate. Some authority, directly responsible  to the people, i.e., elected, should have veto powers over the continuing  exploitation of this county's land and people by five, money-hungry  politicians.  </P> <P> MARCELLA S. McGLOTHLIN  </P> <P> Malibu  </P></p>

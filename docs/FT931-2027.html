			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Ruling boosts Wellcome DRUGS manufacturer Wellcome was one of only a handful of strong performers in the Footsie-100 and the only stock to make progress among the big international drug companies after the relevant US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) committee recommended approval of Wellcome's Lamictal drug. Lamictal is used as a complimentary preparation to existing epilepsy treatment and the FDA's committee recommended approval on Saturday. The approval news saw Wellcome shares marked higher and continue to gain ground at the outset of trading. At best the shares touched 898p. They closed a net 6 higher at 894p with turnover reaching an above-average 1.3m. Dealers also said the market was looking for a good set of interim results from Wellcome on Thursday. Leading pharmaceuticals analysts expect Wellcome to achieve pre-tax profits in excess of Pounds 320m, against last time's Pounds 244m.</p>

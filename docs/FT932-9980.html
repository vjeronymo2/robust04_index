			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Doubts over EC investment law THE way that European countries choose to implement European Community law on investment regulation could have an impact on the attractions of competing European financial centres, according to speakers at a conference in London yesterday organised by the Financial Times. The Capital Adequacy Directive and the Investment Services Directive, the cornerstones of EC law on the investment markets, leave considerable scope for national discretion. Commenting on the implementation of the ISD, Mr Bob Steel, head of equities at Goldman Sachs in London, said: 'Upon the results of this process depend many strategic questions for investment firms.' Mr Steel pointed to three concerns about the directive, which will give investment firms authorised in one EC state a passport to operate in all others. First, there was still the possibility of new rules that would adversely affect the efficient operation of market intermediaries. Second, ambiguities in the text meant that the directive could be interpreted in many different ways. Third, the fact that the single passport for investment firms would be introduced three years after a similar passport for banks which are active in the securities markets would put investment firms at a disadvantage. Mr Steel pointed to the compromise on market transparency that was struck in the directive, allowing member states to restrict the extent to which investors can use 'off-exchange' markets. Hampering the use of such markets, which include London's Seaq International, could hinder the operation of financial markets, he warned. Mr Peter Baring, chairman of Barings, also called for close attention to the implementation of the Capital Adequacy Directive in national law.</p>

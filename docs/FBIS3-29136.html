			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 12 KYODO -- Liberal Democratic Party  President Yohei Kono voiced his regret Saturday [12 February]  over the failure of Japan and the United States to reach accord  on a "framework" agreement to slash Japan's trade surplus and  open its markets. In his statement, the leader of the main  opposition party blamed the failure on the government of Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, saying the cabinet relied on the  bureaucracy to settle the trade talks and abandoned its  political responsibility.    Kono, rejecting Hosokawa's tacit criticism against past LDP  governments, said it was a denial of cooperative ties between  Japan and the United States built up while the LDP was in power.    At a press conference with President Bill Clinton in  Washington, Hosokawa said, "in the past, Japan and the U.S.  sometimes have reached ambiguous agreements which can gloss  over the problems at the time only to find them sources of later  misunderstandings between our two countries." Kono said  Hosokawa's remark "insults the Japan-U.S. relationship."    But the opposition leader also called it "natural" for Japan  to reject the U.S. demand for setting numerical targets to  measure the openness of Japanese markets to imports.</p>

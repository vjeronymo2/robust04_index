			<p>BFN     [Text] Kampala, 12 Apr (KNA) -- Ugandan border villages in  Ntungamo and Kabale districts came under attack from Rwandan  troops on Sunday [10 April], the independent MONITOR newspaper  reported Tuesday. Dr. Ruhakana Rugunda, works, transport and  communications minister and National Resistance Council (NRC)  (Parliament) member for Kabale Municipality, on Tuesday  confirmed the shelling, but said he lacked details. "We don't  have any specific details of the incident," he said.    The state-owned NEW VISION newspaper said four artillery  shells form the Rwandan hill of Muriha landed in Kamwezi in  Kabale District on Sunday near the UN Military Observers' team  [UN Observer Mission for Uganda and Rwanda -- UNOMUR] station.  The shells from Rwandan Government troops currently engaged in  a shoot out with the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA) hit  Kamwezi at midday, but caused no injury or damage to property.    Increased fighting between the Armed Forces and the RPA has  been reported since the death of Rwandan President Major General  Juvenal Habyarimana in a plane crash on Wednesday.    The situation along the Uganda-Rwanda border areas is,  however, said to be calm, although World Food Program (WFP)  relief supplies for Rwanda have been stuck in Uganda's border  town of Kabale. The trucks were headed for Kigali and other  turmoil-hit areas in the north of the country before the  outbreak of the chaos in Rwanda. UNOMUR is meanwhile reported to  have increased the frequency of its patrols across the border.    When the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) invaded Rwanda from  Uganda in 1990, Rwanda Government troops retaliated with  artillery attacks. Rwanda has accused Uganda of active support  for the RPF rebels.    Meanwhile, hundreds of Rwandan civilians from the Ruhengeri  region have continued to enter Uganda and Zaire as they flee the  fighting between the RPF and government troops, THE NEW VISION  reported.    Reports from the border adjoining the three countries said  civilians had not been directly affected by the fresh clashes  between the two sides, but had been scared away by the sound of  gunfire, which could be heard from a close range.    In spite the growing chaos in the troubled state, a number  of  Rwandan refugees have continued to enter Rwanda through safe  areas under the RPA after leaving camps in Uganda. A lorry full  of refugees was reportedly seen crossing into Rwanda through an  unofficial entry point on Sunday.</p>

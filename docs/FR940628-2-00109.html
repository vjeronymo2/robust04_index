			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A basic feature of T.D. 56487 was that refiners could, at their option, attribute to designated imported crude petroleum or petroleum derivatives a quantity of an exported petroleum product in excess of the quantity of that petroleum product actually produced from either the designated imported crude petroleum or petroleum derivative or the crude petroleum or petroleum derivative that was substituted for the designated import. This feature, called ``producibility,'' permits drawback to be claimed on a given quantity of designated imported crude petroleum or petroleum derivatives up to the quantity of an exported petroleum product which  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> could  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> have been produced from the designated imported crude petroleum or petroleum derivatives. Under the producibility concept, as provided for in T.D. 56487, a refiner is not required to establish that the exported articles were actually produced from the substituted crude petroleum or petroleum derivatives; the refiner need only show that the exported articles  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> could  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> have been produced from the designated imported crude petroleum or petroleum derivative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The application of the producibility concept to petroleum refinery operations is illustrated in the following example, quoted from the ruling published as T.D. 78&hyph;419. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Suppose that 100 barrels of crude petroleum are refined into 10 products in equal amounts, including 10 barrels of motor gasoline. One half of the crude is imported duty-paid, which can be designated for drawback, and one half (50 barrels) is domestic of the same kind and quality. Only the motor gasoline is exported. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The production standards for petroleum, unlike those for most chemicals, are subject to variation at the election of the refiner. In other words, the refiner could have produced 91 barrels of motor gasoline from 100 barrels of crude [i.e. Class III], had he wanted to.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To require the refiner to designate a quantity of imported crude sufficient to have produced concurrently each product actually produced, whether or not exported, would either require him to designate more than the 50 barrels of imported crude that was used, or to accept drawback on only 5 barrels (one-half) of the total quantity of motor gasoline exported.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the other hand, disregarding the nonexported products for the purpose of determining the quantity of imported crude to designate, it is clear that up to 91 percent of the 50 barrels of imported crude could have been refined into motor gasoline. Therefore, the refiner would have to designate only slightly more than 10 barrels of imported crude to cover all of the motor gasoline exported. This is the Treasury Department position. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The quantity of a given petroleum product which could have been produced from a given quantity of crude petroleum or petroleum derivative is determined on the basis of ``Industry Standards of Potential Production on a Practical Operating Basis.'' These standards were published in T.D. 66&hyph;16. The standards listed the quantity of 17 petroleum products which could have been produced from four classes of crude petroleum and 12 petroleum derivatives (e.g., the producibility percentages for class III crude petroleum for motor gasoline and aviation gasoline are 91 and 40 respectively, meaning that 91 gallons of motor gasoline or 40 gallons of aviation gasoline could be produced from 100 gallons of class III crude petroleum).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to establishing procedures for the use of the concept of producibility for the refining of crude petroleum and petroleum derivatives, T.D. 56487 divided crude petroleum and petroleum derivatives into classes for purposes of determining same kind and quality. (In order to claim drawback under 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) on the exportation of articles manufactured from domestic or other merchandise substituted for designated imported merchandise, the designated imported merchandise and the substituted merchandise must be of the same kind and quality.) Four classes, based on API gravity, were established. Crude petroleum in any one class would be considered as being of the same kind and quality as any other crude petroleum included in the same class and any named petroleum derivative in any class would be considered as being of the same kind and quality as the same named derivative in the same class. As stated above, under T.D. 56487, a refiner was not required to establish that  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> crude petroleum or petroleum derivative used to produce the exported article was of the same kind and quality as the designated imported crude petroleum or petroleum derivative; the refiner was required to establish that this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> could  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> have been the case. (I.e., If a refiner used different classes of crude petroleum during a production period subject to different standards of producibility, the refiner was required to establish only that a sufficient quantity, taking into consideration the applicable standards of producibility, of crude petroleum of the same class as the designated imported crude petroleum was used in the refinery during the period; not that it was actually used for the production of exported article.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Distribution of drawback among the products produced during a production period under T.D. 56487 is based on the relative values of all products manufactured or produced during the production period, as of the time of separation of the products. (The time of separation of the products is considered to be the monthly period of production.) Relative values are stated in terms of drawback factors, which attach to each of the products manufactured or produced during the production period. (E.g., If, under T.D. 56487, crude petroleum was used to produce 50 barrels of motor gasoline valued at $30 per barrel, 25 barrels of distillate oils valued at $20 per barrel, and 25 barrels of all other petrochemical products valued at $80 per barrel, the drawback factors would be: motor gasoline_.75; residual oils_.5; and all other petrochemical products_2.) The quantity of crude petroleum which may be designated for the exportation of a particular product is determined by multiplying the quantity of the article exported by the drawback factor. (E.g., In the above example if 10 barrels of motor gasoline were exported, 7.5 barrels of crude petroleum could be designated; if 10 barrels of petrochemical products were exported, 20 barrels of crude petroleum could be designated.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

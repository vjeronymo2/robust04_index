			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOCKHEED VOWS TO FIGHT ALL 440 OSHA CHARGES;  </P> <P> FIRM WILL ALSO CHALLENGE $1.5 MILLION IN FINES LEVIED AGAINST BURBANK PLANT  </P> <P> Lockheed said Thursday that it will fight all 440 allegations of worker-safety  violations that federal officials have lodged against the aerospace giant's  Burbank plant, whose projects include the top-secret stealth fighter jet.  </P> <P> Lockheed also plans to contest $1.5 million in fines that the U.S. Occupational  Safety and Health Administration said the company should pay because of the  alleged violations, which OSHA announced March 24. The proposed fines were the  largest since OSHA took over enforcement of job safety and health laws in  California from state officials in July, 1987.  </P> <P> OSHA alleged that Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co., the division that runs the  Burbank operations, mislabeled or failed to label chemical containers, failed  to post mandatory health warnings to workers and kept poor records of which  workers became sick or injured at the plant.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Called 'Willful'  </P> <P> OSHA also asserted that 341 of the 440 alleged violations were "willful,"  which, under OSHA's rules, means that Lockheed either knew that a work site  condition was a violation or was aware that an unsafe condition existed and  made "no reasonable effort" to fix it.  </P> <P> However, Lockheed Aeronautical President Kenneth Cannestra, in a letter sent to  employees Thursday, said "we at LASC object strongly to the characterization of  any of the alleged violations as being 'willful.'  </P> <P> "It has always been Lockheed's intent to comply with all safety and health  regulations," Cannestra said. "We will continue to cooperate fully with OSHA  and other regulatory agencies to ensure the safety and health of our  employees."  </P> <P> The company had 15 working days to respond to the findings. During that period,  Lockheed and OSHA held informal talks that might have led to a settlement of  the allegations, but "we weren't able to resolve the matter in that time," said  Frank Gravitt, OSHA's regional director in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Lockheed, which is based in Calabasas, will now formally contest the  allegations before an administrative law judge of the Occupational Safety and  Health Review Commission in Washington. If either side appeals the judge's  ruling, the case will be decided by the three-member commission, Gravitt said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Complaints Triggered Probe  </P> <P> Gravitt said he did not know exactly when the case will be heard but said it is  likely to be between two months and a year from now.  </P> <P> OSHA cited Lockheed after a four-month investigation of some of its 200  buildings in Burbank. The probe was triggered by workers' complaints that they  became ill from working with chemicals and other hazardous materials at the  plant and that they were not adequately protected from the materials or told of  the danger.  </P> <P> Some of the materials are believed to be involved in making "composites" --  lightweight yet strong fibrous materials that are increasingly used in aircraft  construction. Composites are particularly useful for radar-evading stealth  airplanes because the materials do not reflect radar waves as easily as  metal-bodied jets, making them more difficult to detect.  </P> <P> OSHA is continuing to investigate Lockheed. In announcing the citations three  weeks ago, OSHA said it also sent inspectors back for a "wall-to-wall"  inspection of Lockheed's entire Burbank operations, which employ 14,000 people  overall.  </P> <P> Lockheed is also defending itself against several civil suits that have been  filed since 1986 by about 90 current and former employees, who also alleged  that they became ill while working at the Burbank plant.  </P> <P> Some of the employees have contended that the OSHA citations, if upheld, would  buttress their lawsuits. Lockheed spokesman James Ragsdale said last week that  "it seems possible" that OSHA's report could be introduced into court, but he  declined to speculate on how it might affect the outcome of the suits.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: 'WIZARD OF OZ' ANNIVERSARY: DOWN THE YELLOW BOOK ROAD  </P> <P> The observance of the 50th anniversary of the premiere of "The Wizard of Oz" is  nearly seven months away -- it's Aug. 9. But publishers already have several  illustrated books set to cash in on nostalgia, like . . .  </P> <P> The search for the genuine ruby slippers worn by Judy Garland in "Oz," subject  of a Calendar series last March, will be the focus of a trade paperback due out  in June. "The Ruby Slippers of Oz: The Power, Passion and Pursuit of the  World's Most Famous Shoes," by Rhys Thomas, will be published by Tale Weaver  Publishing, Los Angeles.  </P> <P> In his Calendar articles, Thomas uncovered several existing pairs, one of which  sold for $165,000 in an August auction. The late Kent Warner, a studio costumer  who saved many of the shoes, will be a central figure in the book, among other  zealous collectors.  </P> <P> The slippers are the focus of the book, but "it's really about the weird  underworld of Hollywood memorabilia," Thomas said.  </P> <P> In July, Delta will reissue Aljean Harmetz's "The Making of the 'Wizard of Oz,'  " originally published in 1977, a history of the picture's production and the  MGM era. New York Times reporter Harmetz said new information in the Delta  trade paperback was partly inspired by Thomas' discoveries about the ruby  slippers. She also publishes -- for the first time -- the names of 122 of the  124 actors who portrayed the Munchkins.  </P> <P>  Helping Harmetz put together the Munchkin cast list was Stephen Cox, whose  "The Munchkins Remember 'The Wizard of Oz' and Beyond" -- interviews with 28  surviving little people from the movie -- will be published by E.P. Dutton in  June.  </P> <P> Despite their importance in the film, the individual Munchkin actors were never  given screen credit, Cox said -- just the collective "Munchkins played by  Singer's Midgets."  </P> <P> "Now," said Cox, "they finally get some of the recognition they deserve, and  the opportunity to tell their stories."

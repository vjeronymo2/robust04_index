			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with European Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan by </F> Marc Paoloni in Brussels; date not given: "Sir Leon Brittan  Says `I Am Prepared To Succeed Jacques Delors'"]    [Paolini] This Tuesday [15 February], the Director General  of the GATT received the final offers for the reduction of  customs duties. Have you managed, since the conclusion of the  Uruguay Round, to obtain the extra concessions you were seeking?    [Brittan] The date of 15 February did not simply mark the  end  of a technical stage: Each party had to officially make its  offer by this date. We have used the last two months  effectively to try to obtain more generous offers from certain  of our partners, but we had no intention of reopening the  negotiations held in the run-up to 15 December. The concessions  made by all sides can still be improved until the very last  moment, and that moment, as always in negotiations, has not yet  arrived. I am nevertheless convinced that, in the long term,  the European Union will obtain a result that will represent a  real improvement over what was obtained on 15 December,  especially in the area of textiles.    [Paolini] Who, up to now, has not made the effort you would  have hoped for?    [Brittan] Japan. That country has already done a lot, we  must admit it, but we have asked for a considerable extra effort  in the sectors that concern a great many of our companies.  However, it is true that to date we have not been very  successful.    [Paolini] Experts have relativized these initial Japanese  efforts saying that Tokyo is only bringing its official customs  duties down to the levels actually applied in recent years....    [Brittan] That is an exaggeration. However, as in all  exaggerations, there is some truth. Indeed, the degree to which  the Japanese market has opened up to date is not as significant  as it might appear at first sight.    [Paolini] This is a sentiment that is shared by the American  authorities since, this weekend, Tokyo refused to make any  commitment on import levels. What do you think of this failure  and the risks of a trade war that it carries?    [Brittan] I was not at all surprised by this failure.  Neither  do I favor the approach taken by the Americans, for two reasons.  Firstly, I am convinced that this method would not have  positive results. Secondly, if you believe in free trade and  the market economy, you cannot go down the road to the carving  up of markets. The Americans had, in a way, taken this path.    [Paolini] You must admit that it has served them quite well  up to now, especially when you look at the results obtained by  the Community over the last 10 years....    [Brittan] For the reasons I have explained, I took a  different approach. We set up a mechanism with the Japanese  that lets us examine in detail the reasons for our trade  deficits. This analysis should make it possible to take a fresh  look at tariff obstacles, structural problems, and the lack of  effort on the part of our own companies. Then, on this basis,  we will try and define the measures we need to implement to  remedy the situation. This analysis is almost complete, and I  am fairly optimistic. I am not saying we will get immediate and  concrete results in all areas, but I do think that come the  spring we will have obtained more than the Americans.    [Paolini] You took a similar approach with the Americans to  persuade them to open up their public markets. The next stage  depends on the results of a study that you commissioned with  Mickey Kantor on the true extent of liberalization on both sides  of the Atlantic. How far have you gone with this?    [Brittan] We have had the results of the study for some time  and now we have to digest its conclusions. We already concluded  a partial agreement with the United States last year, and we  will continue to negotiate on the basis of this study to try and  obtain more. As in 1993, I am looking for a greater opening up  of the American public markets while refusing any imbalance  between the two sides.    [Paolini] Who is the more protectionist according to this  study?    [Brittan] For the time being I will simply say that our  concerns have been justified.    [Paolini] On 28 February you will be in Beijing to negotiate  with another important trading partner. Exchange, cooperation,  etc. are all on the agenda, but so is the issue of China's  candidacy for GATT membership. Will you go armed with a  proposal?    [Brittan] The decision has not yet been made, but the idea  is  still to open negotiations with this vast country -- the last  one which does not have a market economy yet. Negotiations will  be aimed at persuading China to accept the normal rules of  international trade to which all the other GATT countries are  subject. We must first have agreement on that basic point.  Only then can we discuss the details and the measures that we  and the Chinese are ready to accept. When I say "we" I mean the  international community as a whole because, for example, the  American position is not exactly the same as our own. Moreover,  when I speak of "details," it must be clear that I do not mean  unimportant matters. How could it be otherwise, when we are  talking about child labor. However, that is as much as I am  prepared to say for the time being.    [Paolini] Returning to GATT, can you describe any recent  progress in other aspects of the Uruguay Round?    [Brittan] No, it is still much too early to say what the  results are. For example, there are still two more years of  discussions ahead of us on financial services and a little less  than two years, I hope, for maritime transport and steel  production. These are issues for which, to date, we have only  established a general approach and which we must now conclude in  detail.    [Paolini] Should we fear that the interest shown by  Washington in the relationship between trade, the environment,  and working standards is aimed at slowing down the creation of  the World Trade Organization?    [Brittan] That is a baseless fear. Neither the United States  nor any other country has set out preconditions for the creation  of this organization. The international community is simply  agreed that a working program should be set up to examine the  links between trade and problems of the environment -- on this  point and on this point alone. I do not think there will be  discussions on these points when the agreement is signed in  Marrakech. Your question reveals the impression the Americans  could have given -- perhaps in some of the things President  Clinton has said -- when they stressed firmly that the  environment and working conditions must take priority in the  next phase of negotiations.    [Paolini] If we now leave the international scene and turn  to  the European Union, the overriding concern is the seriousness of  the unemployment situation. What do you say to those people who  put the blame for this on the choices made at Maastricht?    [Brittan] The White Paper on Growth, Competition and  Employment provided an in-depth and pertinent analysis of the  factors of this crisis. One thing is clear: The cause of our  problems does not lie in the fact that we have followed overly  monetarist "Maastrichian" policies. The authors of the treaty  did not consider strict monetarism to be more important than  employment. Their analysis revealed that the precondition for a  healthy economy is the reduction of budget deficits, and  therefore this is a precondition to growth and job creation. It  is not about choosing monetary orthodoxy at the expense of the  real economy. I believe this analysis remains entirely  justified. If we abandon it, it means we are prepared for more  inflation. If we look at economic history we see that those  countries that followed anti-inflationary policies obtained the  best results.    [Paolini] That theory does not go down too well with the  unemployed. Are you not afraid of a social explosion in Europe?    [Brittan] I am convinced the economic situation will  improve.  We are coming out of a recession. Not very quickly, it is  true, but the signs should be clearer by spring. Having said  that, the structural problems will remain. The white paper  indicated the efforts the Twelve will have to make, both  individually and collectively. The GATT negotiations showed us  what the Twelve can achieve when they are united. We can tackle  all the basic problems if we go about it in a realistic way and  with long-term vision. As for the immediate risks of a social  explosion, I cannot say they do not exist, but the situation  varies from one member state to the next. If you think I am  being rather optimistic, that's because I am can also see,  parallel to the progressive improvement in the economy, the  start of the implementation of concrete structural measures  identified by the white paper.    [Paolini] At the European summit meeting to be held in Corfu  in June, the Twelve will appoint a successor to Jacques Delors  as president of the European Commission. Are you a candidate  for the post?    [Brittan] I would not use the word "candidate" because that  implies an electoral campaign. Quite frankly, it is not a  question of candidacy or campaigning. The president of the  European Commission is appointed by the heads of state and  government. However, I have been a member of the Commission for  five years now, and I have done many things there. If the heads  of state and government decide I can continue my work as  president, I would be very honored and am prepared to take on  the task.</p>

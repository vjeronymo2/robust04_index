			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Call to speed wider EC talks GERMANY is pressing for rapid acceleration of the negotiations with Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway to join the European Community if the goal of accession by January 1 1995 is to be met. The fear in Bonn is that if the negotiations are not concluded by the end of February, 1994, it will be impossible to conclude ratification formalities through the European parliament, and all the individual national parliaments, by the end of the year. The danger will then be that the whole enlargement process will slip back to 1996 or even 1997 and political momentum lost, according to officials. The urgency of the enlargement timetable is such that Bonn believes far-reaching institutional reforms of the EC, to streamline its activities, should be postponed until the next full-scale inter-governmental conference on political union in 1996. Both Paris and London, as well as many politicians in Germany, are concerned that the enlarged community will become hopelessly unwieldy and incapable of taking decisions without institutional reforms. They would include reduction in the size of the European Commission and the European Court, and overhauling the current six-monthly rotation of the EC presidency. Ideas for streamlining the commission to just 10 members, and similarly reducing the size of the European court, have been floated in Paris and Bonn. However the thinking now in Germany is that it will be impossible to reach political agreement on such a drastic move in the next five months. Another key element in the reform debate - probably the most contentious issue of all - is the future weighting of votes in the EC Council of Ministers, between the large member states, like Britain, France, Germany and Italy, and the smaller ones. The enlarged community will reduce the ability of the Big Three to prevent decisions they do not like.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] At the ESCAP [Economic and Social Commission for  Asia and the Pacific] session in New Delhi, many developing  countries have voiced full support to India's stand against the  creation of new trade barriers after the GATT agreement comes  into force. These countries include Malaysia, Indonesia,  Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, South Korea, China, and Hong Kong. The  Bangladesh delegate urged the ESCAP secretariat to send a  message to the forthcoming ministerial conference on GATT at  Marrakech on this matter. The Indonesian delegate also said  environment and social issues should not be used as an excuse  for interfering in the internal affairs of any country and for  imposing conditions on development assistance.    New speakers participating in the plenary and the Committee  on Regional Economic Cooperation said linking trade and nontrade  issues poses a threat to the exports from the third world. It  also negates the spirit of free trade under the Uruguay Round of  Trade and Tariff Agreement. While some least developed  countries and New Zealand, Australia, and Japan remained more or  less noncommittal, the U.S. delegate was quoted as saying that  his country is not trying to impose any protectionism nor reduce  the advantage of the developing nations.    Other issues that dominated the ESCAP session today relate  to  the problem of infrastructure development and the need to ensure  environment friendly development programs. Most delegates said  better network of roads and communication facilities is  important for boosting economic growth in the region. Several  countries voiced the need for additional funds for financing the  implementation of the agenda adopted at the Rio Earth Summit.</p>

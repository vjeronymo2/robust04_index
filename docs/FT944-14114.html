			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Management (The Growing Business): High-tech firms should get support - In a Nutshell The government is being urged to formulate a policy that will encourage the start-up of high-technology and knowledge-based companies, following research into the fortunes of such businesses over a six-year period. Professor David Storey, director of the small- and medium-sized enterprise centre at Warwick University, says there is clear evidence that high-tech companies grow more quickly than other start-ups. More surprisingly, says Storey, their survival rate is significantly higher than that of typical small businesses. The findings emerge from a study* of the performance of high-tech companies within and outside the UK's science parks between 1986 and 1992, co-authored by Storey. It shows that knowledge-based companies attached to science parks grew slightly more quickly than similar companies elsewhere. The on-park companies also grew more quickly in terms of the number of people employed. However, being based on or off the park makes no difference to a company's chances of survival. Storey says the study suggests the government must make a more robust effort to support high-tech start-ups. 'I am normally strongly opposed to supporting start-ups,' he says. 'But high-tech start-ups are very important for the long-term development of the British economy.' According to the report, the government should also consider how to encourage the development of more science-based entrepreneurs. It shows that nearly half the founders of high-tech companies had a higher degree in a science-based subject. 'The single most important issue is that the supply of these potential entrepreneurs has to be supplemented,' the report says. The UK Science Park Association estimates nearly 412 companies employed 5,300 staff on UK science parks in 1986, when the study started. Seven years later there were 1,188 science park companies which between them employed nearly 20,000 people. *Assessment of Firms located on and off Science Parks in the UK.

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Cairo, 20 Jun (MENA) -- Arab League Secretary  General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid and UN envoy Lakhdar Ibrahimi  today reviewed the outcome of recent consultations between  Ibrahimi and Yemeni officials concerning the Yemeni crisis.  [passage omitted]    Asked about the nature of the problem facing a possible  direct meeting between southern and northern Yemeni delegations,  Ibrahimi said: I cannot speak in behalf of Yemeni sides. The  two parties have agreed to accept the cease-fire and a mechanism  should be created to stabilize that cease-fire.    This mechanism, Ibrahimi stated, consists of observers  monitoring the cease-fire on the battle lines. He pointed out  that the northerners want to revive the military committee but  the southerners reject the idea, pointing to the committee's  failure to end the fighting in the past.    The UN envoy said that a compromise solution must be found  and that a new formula for this mechanism should be found that  is acceptable to both parties.    Answering a question on whether he will hold other meetings  with the Yemeni delegations in Cairo today, Ibrahimi said that  he will not hold further meetings for the time being, but will  fly to New York to report on his mission to the UN Secretary  General. The UN envoy said that he will, however, remain in  touch with the concerned parties and with the Arab League in an  effort to resolve what he described as a difficult problem.    Asked to comment on Sanaa's refusal to deal with Aden as a  state, Ibrahimi said that there are real problems involved but  the solution should begin with effecting a cease-fire. He said:  If someone wants to establish a state or preserve unity, why  does he wage military operations?    Commenting on reports about the internationalization of the  crisis, Ibrahimi said that the United States is a superpower  that has international concerns and it is worried about the  situation in Yemen. Washington, he emphasized, supports UN  efforts to end the fighting and initiate dialogue. Third  parties have the right to worry, he remarked.    For his part, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said: The Arab League  Council is still in open session with regard to the Yemeni  crisis. 'Abd-al-Majid welcomed every effort exerted to resolve  the Yemeni crisis. He said that he backs Ibrahimi's call for an  end to the fighting in Yemen, saying that the devastation and  bloodshed are detrimental to everything that the Yemenis have  achieved in the past.</p>

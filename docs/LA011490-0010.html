			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Since I grew up with the classic cartoons of Walt Disney and Warner Bros., I  find contemporary cartoons, which my 2-year-old is stuck with, virtually  intolerable to sit through. What is supposed to be humorous lacks all creative  humor whatsoever. It makes me laugh that people have voiced complaints of  violence depicted in some of the old classics, yet no one minds the warfare  depicted in "Ninja Turtles," "Beetlejuice" and the "G.I. Joe" and "RoboCop"  cartoons.  </P> <P> Christopher M. McGinn, Phillips Ranch  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Natalya Varnavskaya: "Tax Payment Should Become </F> a Pleasant Necessity"]    [Text] Reforms await Russia's tax system this summer.  As Oleg Soskovets declared at the congress of the Association of  Russian Banks yesterday, changes in the tax system will be  promulgated as early as June. For now government plans have the  stamp of secrecy. However, there is information that fundamental  reform of the existing tax system, which pursues primarily the  aim of budget replenishment, can take place during the  forthcoming summer.    The possibility of such a development of events is confirmed  by statements by several high-ranking government  representatives. Thus, at a government meeting yesterday  Yevgeniy Yasin, director of the administration's analytical  center, announced the need to increase taxation on citizens'  "superincome," as well as to shift the center of gravity to  taxation on the property of natural persons. For example, it was  proposed that one-half of all citizens' income over 300 million  rubles be withdrawn into the state treasury (the maximum income  tax rate now makes up 30 percent of the amount of more than 30  million rubles). At present virtually any tax changes are made  only in the interests of the budget. The most important figures  in tax policy also admit this. Thus, according to Deputy Finance  Minister Sergey Aleksashenko, "any taxes pursue fiscal aims  exclusively and all the rest is based on unnecessary  complications." The reason for such an approach by the  authorities is quite understandable: This is the only acceptable  way out under present political conditions.    The parliament and the government work out the principles of  tax policy. However, their realization is placed on the  shoulders of the State Tax Service. The anger of taxpayers, who  have lost any hope of understanding anything in the tax policy  of the state, spills over at its representatives. The course of  their thoughts is quite understandable. It is more difficult to  understand the logic of representatives of the highest echelon  of Russian leadership, among whom the negative evaluation of the  work of the State Tax Service has become almost a ritual. Boris  Yeltsin's message to the Federal Assembly, more accurately, the  phrase that under the existing tax regime "it is impossible to  live; it is only possible to die," gave the reason for the  especially sharp criticism of the State Tax Service. Since that  day almost every high-ranking government representative has  managed to express dissatisfaction with the work of the tax  service. It is most interesting that parliament members, who  thus far have not examined a single matter concerning the making  of changes in the existing tax system at their meetings, also  express dissatisfaction.    Nevertheless, there is also a more valid accusation--of  unjustified rigidity--brought against the tax service by  representatives of entrepreneurial circles, in particular, in  connection with the excessively rigid interpretation of some  legislative acts; for example, of the law on the use of the word  Russia and of word combinations formed on their basis in names  of enterprises. Although the decision on the introduction of  this tax was adopted by the parliament, it was the State Tax  Service that gave a broad interpretation of this law, in  accordance with which this tax is imposed on all joint ventures.    In the opinion of KOMMERSANT-DAILY experts, there are two  most probable reasons for such behavior by tax service workers.  First of all, the Ministry of Finance, of course, prompts the  State Tax Service to more rigidly interpret tax legislation. At  the same time, it would be strange to accuse the ministry of a  desire to increase the revenue part of the budget. In any  country throughout the world the Ministry of Finance primarily  guards the interests of the state treasury.    The fear of accusations on the part of structures checking  the activity of tax service workers, the most known of which is  the procuracy, is also reflected in the fact that these workers  make rigid decisions. For now it does not express  dissatisfaction with the work of the State Tax Service, which  was stated by the procuracy representative at the hearings of  the State Duma last Tuesday. Nevertheless, law enforcement  bodies usually interpret any granting of tax privileges to  taxpayers as the manifestation of corruption. Probably, the most  rigid interpretation of legislative norms by the State Tax  Service is due to fears to be subjected to such accusations.    The adoption of a political decision on serious amendments  to  the existing tax system by the parliament and the government in  the very near future can be the most acceptable way out of the  existing situation. However, in the opinion of KOMMERSANT-DAILY  experts, this should not fundamentally change the existing tax  system, because any global reforms will now lead to a legal  chaos. At the same time, it is necessary to simplify tax  legislation, to eliminate most (and perhaps even all) existing  privileges, and to unify the periods of tax payment, while  toughening control over the payment itself. Aleksandr Ivaneyev,  director of the Department of Tax Reforms, also agrees with such  an approach.    In brief, it should be simple and joyful, as far as  possible,  to pay taxes.</p>

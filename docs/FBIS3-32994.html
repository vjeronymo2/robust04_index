			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 10 Feb (PL) -- Carlos Lage, vice  president of the Council of State and executive secretary of the  Council of Ministers, said today his country is satisfied with  the level of relations established with the government of Cesar  Gaviria, who -- Lage disclosed -- was invited to visit Cuba.    Interviewed by the Colombian radio network RCN, Lage noted  that the decision when and if to visit Cuba is up to Gaviria.  Lage also stressed the open dialogue between the countries that  began during President Fidel Castro's visit to Cartagena last  August.    He added that the fundamental purpose of his visit, as was  that of Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina in December, is to  further dialogue and the exploration of possibilities to  increase economic, commercial, and political ties that began  when diplomatic relations were resumed in October.    Lage has met with the ministers of foreign commerce and  agriculture and livestock and with the planning chief. He also  held a long meeting with President Gaviria, the most important  aspect of which, in Lage's opinion, was the frankness of the  analysis of bilateral relations, the current situation, and  problems between the two countries.    In his conversation with RCN and statements published today  by the daily EL ESPECTADOR, the Cuban leader recapped the  different economic measures his government has adopted,  including opening to foreign investment, and said all measures  necessary to defend socialism will be adopted.    Lage said tourism and the pharmaceutical industry have  prompted great interest on the part of Colombian businessmen,  with whom he held broad discussions today during a meeting  organized by the Industrialists Association and attended by the  major economic groups.    When asked about the illegal departure of Cubans from the  island, Lage replied that his country's policy is to allow  emigration and that anyone who wishes to leave can obtain a  visa. The United States, on the other hand, denies visas but  then accepts and grants immediate residence to anyone who  arrives illegally in that country.    Lage also noted that the majority of people support the  revolutionary system, which could not continue without this  support. In replying to another question, he said that Cuba is  the most drug-free country in the world, since it has no  narcotics, corruption, or organized crime. Lage will conclude  his visit today as the last leg of a tour that included Brazil  and Venezuelan.</p>

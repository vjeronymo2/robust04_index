			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDFLY SPRAYING  </P> <P> Surprise, surprise, surprise. What do you know? After six or seven years of  dousing with malathion it seems the infestations are getting worse.  </P> <P> Do I remember the dousing of flies in Africa that finally developed a  DDT-resistant fly? I think if we work on it we can do the job again.  </P> <P> Let's see -- maybe we could ship our malathion-resistant flies around the world  so that we could increase our sales of malathion. We used DDT so extensively  that we almost extinguished one species of birds before someone got the picture  that indiscriminate chemical warfare on bugs is not the answer to pest control.  </P> <P> Instead of killing off the good guys with the pest, it makes more sense to help  the good guys. Killing the ladybugs and any other helpful insect, to say  nothing of bees, small birds and fish, is not my idea of good sense.  </P> <P> GEORGE H. VINCENT  </P> <P> Panorama City  </P></p>

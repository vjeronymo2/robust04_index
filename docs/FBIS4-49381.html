			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Dispatch by reporter Tseng Hui-yen (2582 1979 3601): </F> "China, Russia Exchange Military Data on Areas Within 100  Kilometers of the Border; China Stations Six Times More Troops  Than Russia on Its Northern Border"]    [Text] New York, 4 May (LIEN HO PAO) -- On 3 May, military  commentator Pinhov [1627 0668 1133] said (Andrey Rozykov) [5012  5417 4430 1133], head of the Border Disarmament Negotiations  Office, which is part of the Department of Chinese Affairs under  the Russian Foreign Ministry, had revealed to him that Russia  and China already had exchanged primitive military data on the  areas within 100 km of their border, and will carry out  disarmament work as the next stage, based on this information.    At the same time, Major General Anatoliy Varliya [3907 6849  7161], a former deputy chief of the Bureau of Treaty and Law  under the Russian Defense Ministry, revealed to Pinhov that in  the rear areas along the border, the mainland's military  strength is six times greater than Russia's military strength in  the Far East, and the mainland also has three times more the  fighter planes there, but there is no sign of major movement so  far.    Pinhov said to this newspaper that Rozykov confirmed for the  first time that within 100 km of the 4,000-km border in the  east, the Russian side has deployed 150,000 troops, which  include border defense forces that are not regular Russian  military units, and that the mainland has only 50,000 armed  personnel, made up primarily of the Armed Police, local militia,  and some regular military units. However, in the rear areas, to  a depth of about 300-400 km, the mainland side has concentrated  a large number of troops.    Rozykov said that since 1990, the mainland has kept refusing  the disarmament plans for cutting "military groups at the  military region level," as proposed first by the Soviet Union  and then by Russia, as well as the suggested "disarmament within  25 km of the border." Even now, there are still technical  difficulties during the disarmament negotiations, such as the  way to distinguish regular units from other kinds of armed  forces. He personally thought that as a compromise plan, both  sides might cut 20-30 percent of the armed personnel currently  deployed within 100 km of the border.    Varliya pointed out that the disarmament within 100 km of  the  border will not include the Russian garrisons in Khabarovsk and  Vladivostok. According to him, what is important is that both  sides have built up mutual trust, and do not view each other as  enemies, while the direct links between the military regions of  the two countries also have been strengthened as a result,  whereas the first batch of Chinese military observers entered  Russia last year.</p>

			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Continued job cuts at British Aerospace BRITISH Aerospace, the defence contractor, continued its job-cutting programme yesterday with the shedding of about 650 jobs at Chester, Cheshire, and Filton, Bristol, Daniel Green writes. The plants make parts for Airbus civil aircraft. About 350 jobs are likely to go at Chester and 300 at Filton in the first half of next year. The cuts would leave a combined workforce at the two sites of about 8,000. The news follows the cancellation last week of a Pounds 2.3bn Airbus order by Northwest Airlines. The blow was softened by a Pounds 1bn Airbus order on Tuesday from Los Angeles-based International Lease Finance Corporation.</p>

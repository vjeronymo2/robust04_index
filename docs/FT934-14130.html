			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Gatt chief warns on Uruguay Round MR Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, yesterday warned the US and the European Community that their failure last week to make progress on tariff reductions had put the Uruguay Round of global trade talks in jeopardy. 'The simple fact is that we need a breakthrough now,' he said. Without this 'in the coming days' it would be virtually impossible to conclude the multilateral negotiations on improving market access for farm and industrial goods by the agreed date of November 15. A successful conclusion to the talks on lowering tariffs and other trade barriers to imported goods is seen as essential to securing agreement on controversial aspects of the Uruguay Round draft rules package, including farm trade reform, before the December 15 deadline. Mr Sutherland called for 'new and urgent moves' by the US and EC to 'demonstrate leadership' on market access and said that if their negotiators could not make rapid progress then ministers of the Quad nations - the US, EC, Japan and Canada - should meet 'to thrash out a deal before it is too late'. The EC's new tariff offer, due to be tabled soon, has already been criticised by Washington as not going far enough, while EC negotiators say the US has not sufficiently cut peak tariffs on textiles. Meanwhile, ministers from the 14-strong Cairns Group of agricultural exporting countries ended a meeting in Geneva with a warning that a substantial market access package was essential if the group was to accept the Blair House accord on farm subsidies negotiated by the US and EC last year. Mr Peter Cook, trade minister of Australia, which chairs the group, said at a news conference that if French-led EC pressure produced a weakened Blair House deal 'the chances of acceptance would be zero'. Cairns countries have not endorsed the bilateral accord, which they regard as a lamentable dilution of the earlier draft Gatt agreement on farm trade reform. Mr Cook, who will go to Paris, Bonn and Brussels this week, made a vigorous though veiled attack on France, saying that querying the December 15 deadline sabotaged the negotiating process.</p>

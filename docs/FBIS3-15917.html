TRUD has frequently given your opponents the  chance to have their say. Today the floor is yours. Why are  you setting up your own party, Yegor Timurovich? Do you intend  to use it to become president or to take charge of the Cabinet  of Ministers in two years' time, or are your plans more modest?    [Gaydar] Our goals are highly serious, but they are not  linked with who specifically tries to become president or  premier.    The essence of the political choice and the cataclysms of  1994, defining it as simply as possible, is that, in my opinion,  the present government is unable to make a firm decision about  what it wants to do in the economy. Decisiveness presupposes a  firm choice between one of two consistent and intelligible  strategies.    The first possible strategy is as follows. The government,  faced with the present difficulties and unable to make up its  mind to go forward, firmly pursues the course of establishing a  directive-based, command economy with its plans, funds, quotas,  distribution shortfalls, suppressed inflation, "backdoor  dealings," speculation, unconvertible currency, guaranteed  employment, and so forth. And then everything is understood --  what to do today, tomorrow, and the day after that, what  problems to resolve, what threats arise, and whom to fight.    Then there is the second strategy. The government  understands that it is possible to get out of the current  intermediate position by another route. It decides quickly and  consistently to form market mechanisms, remove excessive state  pressure on the economy, reform the legal system, guarantee the  right to property, stabilize the national currency, gradually  reduce taxes, and create incentives for private savings and  investments. And to carry out reforms on this basis. Then it  is also clear what to do in the first, second, and third stage.    But the most difficult problem arises when neither the first  nor the second decision is made. Then hesitations inevitably  begin. We saw this policy in 1989-1991, when the Union  leadership could not make up its mind.    Now we are again in a similar intermediate position, from  which there are the two possible escape routes of which I have  already spoken. Moreover, the first of them is backed by fairly  clear forces, and, against the background of the inevitable  strains posed by the intermediate position, the possibility  exists that they will manage to convince people that this  solution is the simplest, the most tried and tested, and the  most reliable. Despite the complete futility of this solution,  the danger of its being chosen is real. A highly structured  organization with a long tradition is working toward this end --  the Communist Party.    Before 1992, when the wind seemed to be filling the sails of  democratic transformations, the democrats could afford not to  counterpose to the first alternative a highly structured  organization in the form of a party. "Democratic Russia" was  not a powerful organization either in 1989 or in 1990. It went  from victory to victory on the wave of disillusion with the old  system, the old ideology, and the old bosses. That wave has now  subsided. In order to uphold the second alternative, which, in  my view, is the absolutely essential condition and prerequisite  for the creation of a civilized society in our country, serious  systematic efforts are necessary.    The formation of our party is just such an effort to form a  force which will champion the second, democratic, civilized  alternative in Russia. So that the small shoots of our civil  society which have managed to grow within this period are not  once again flattened by an armor-plated roller. So that they  are not destroyed.    [TRUD] But you, Yegor Timurovich -- indeed, "Choice" as well  -- have the reputation in the eyes of a significant section of  society of being "reformist wreckers." How do you intend to  change this opinion?    [Gaydar] We will direct our main efforts at explaining the  simple truth. It is our duty to explain who, in point of fact,  wrecked the economy, who robbed our gold and currency reserves,  what really could be done, what we did, and, of course, what  needs to be done today to extricate the country from its  difficult position.    It should be borne in mind that we were really forced to  assume the huge burden of responsibility for the reforms.  Ruslan Imranovich [Khasbulatov] artlessly believed that 10 days  after the beginning of the reforms it was already time to  dismiss the government which had done the donkeywork. He simply  underestimated the fact that this donkeywork would take more  than one month. We understood perfectly well how difficult and  thankless this work was, and how easy it was for our opponents  to explain how wonderfully they would have done everything if  evil forces in the shape of Gaydar and "Russia's Choice" had not  interfered.    The benefits which the reforms brought people, despite their  huge costs, were until now almost taken for granted: both the  market, which is more or less stable, and the ruble -- though  people grumble about it, it is on the whole convertible, and you  no longer have to go from Tula to Moscow for sausage meat, or  wait in line.... What was simply impossible to imagine two  years ago had become almost customary. All this, it seemed, was  guaranteed. But now people are beginning to understand that it  is not all completely guaranteed.    Today the question is not whether this could have been done  more easily or more mildly than it was done by Gaydar, but  whether or not it will endure. Or will everything be taken away  again? Of course, it can be taken away. In 1925, as a result  of the New Economic Policy, there was a fully developed market  in Russia, but in 1928 they again introduced ration cards, and  there came a famine and other choice delights. Will this be  repeated?    What we have on our side is clarity. Perhaps not very  pleasant, but clarity all the same. It is absolutely clear what  we stand for and what we will not allow while we are alive and  able to do something. So much for our reputation.    [TRUD] Right now many parties of every kind are being set  up. Not one of them has yet done anything, hence they have  nothing to answer for. But you already have the burden of  responsibility for the past hanging round your neck....    [Gaydar] Thank God, we now have more opportunity to talk  frankly than before. After all, it becomes both funny and sad  when it suddenly turns out that, for everything that the  government did without me in the spring of 1993 -- they kept the  crazy state order for agricultural production, they kept  preferential credits, they fixed crazy prices, they adopted a  whole range of federal programs that were wholly unsupported,  they introduced state subsidies for mixed feed and increased  other subsidies -- for all this, it turns out, Gaydar is now to  blame. Just as I am to blame for the fact that, when I came in,  I started to abolish preferential credits and subsidies.... I  am also blamed for the fact that Chernomyrdin cannot fulfill the  promises he dished out in the spring.    We all understand this. But before, shackled by government  solidarity, we could not say so plainly, because quarrels of  this kind are, in my view, appropriate either in cabinet  sessions, or if you are no longer working in the government.  But now I can talk frankly about it all.    [TRUD] Your opponents say roughly the following: Gaydar  delayed the payment of wages, so inflation was reduced, but now  Chernomyrdin has paid the accumulated debts, and inflation has  shot up.    [Gaydar] What is the crux of this problem? Since last  spring, from the time that the government issued a colossal  number of impracticable promises, events have been operating, as  it were, according to two sets of logic. One is the logic of  current funding: Money, generally speaking, can be counted;  some is given out, some is not. But another logic began to  develop -- the economy of promises, which is always mixed with  untruths. Because it is simply impossible to deliver such  promises afterward.    When we came into the government last fall, the essence of  our actions was not delaying the payment of wages -- that was  done before we came, in May, June, July, and August -- but  trying to quickly reduce the volume of impracticable promises.  To stop lying, to put it simply. And we at once launched an  assault on the most expensive impracticable promises --  preferential credits.    [TRUD] You supported the liberalization of bread prices and  at the same time planned to win the elections?    [Gaydar] Yes, I knew that that was politically  disadvantageous, but it was honest. I was actually in favor of  saying bluntly that we could not pay subsidies on mixed feed,  and I revoked them. But the subsidies were restored the next  day. That was last October. But after all, they are not being  paid today. There is no money to do so. They represent a  fantastic expense! You could stop funding higher and secondary  education and science altogether -- you still would not be able  to afford these subsidies. But instead of honestly saying to  agricultural workers: You will not get this money, do not  expect it -- they continue to promise it.    I believe that the most terrible vice of the policy pursued  in 1993 was that it was a policy of budget payment defaults, a  policy of unaffordable promises. After all, if you really want  the fascists to come to power in the elections, employ the  simplest policy -- first promise, and then fail to deliver.  Nothing could be simpler!    [TRUD] To what extent, in your opinion, did the flaws and  failures of the reformist course and the shock therapy help  strengthen national radicalism?    [Gaydar] All radical social transformations are a difficult  and painful affair. Some people adapt very well, others with  difficulty and badly. And society always reacts to this pain  with an upsurge of aggression, an attempt to find someone to  blame, to find simple explanations.    It is this that lies at the heart of our desire to bring the  time frames of economic and social transformations in Russia as  close together as possible. And the fact that we did not manage  to do this fully -- that the reforms began to skid -- in my view  substantially increased the risk of the advent of radical  national socialism.    [TRUD] Our multiparty system has expressed itself in the  form of an unthinkable number of lilliputian parties. What are  you doing to ensure that your party is not the same sort of  closet-cum-club organization? Do you have support in the  regions?    [Gaydar] We do indeed have very few real parties, and of  them the most powerful and viable is the Communist Party. The  democrats also have their own organizations, but they are very  badly structured, without clear discipline or fixed membership.  Our main task today is to create a sufficiently broad  organization, taking whatever lies in the potential of  democratic structures and is at the same time clear and  definite. Anyway, it was the largest faction in the Duma,  backed by dozens of deputies representing the democratic forces  in the most diverse regions of Russia, which took the initiative  to organize the party. A faction for which millions of Russians  voted. Of course a party will be viable if it has support in  the regions. We have such support, I believe.    [TRUD] Do you not think that "Democratic Russia's" recent  decision, in which it was mildly intimated that you cannot rely  on "Democratic Russia's" support, will affect the formation of  your party?    [Gaydar] "Democratic Russia" is, of course, a large  organization, in which there are many people with different  viewpoints. I believe that we have a reasonable dialogue with  them, and we by no means want to cram all "Democratic Russia's"  activists into the new party. I consider their council's  resolution that "`Democratic Russia's' regional organizations  will determine independently the degree of their practical  participation" in the formation of our party as a mild form of  support. We hope to hold our constituent congress in late May.    [TRUD] You will recall that when the formation of the  "Russia's Choice" movement was just beginning, the first to  propose setting up a party on the basis of the movement was  Gennadiy Burbulis. Has he lost the initiative today, or have  you seized it?    [Gaydar] Gennadiy Eduardovich did indeed more than once  express the idea of creating such a democratic party -- in 1992  and in early 1993. But the problems which then stood in the way  could not be overcome. Today this is a decision of the faction  to which he also belongs. I know that Burbulis has his own  special approaches to the problems of party organization and the  development of a party-based movement. I think that we should  give him the chance to spell out his position.    [TRUD] The name of your party is the "Liberal Conservative  Party." However, "Russia's Choice" is known as more of a  radical democratic movement. Does not the one exclude the other?    [Gaydar] Indeed, today we are perhaps the biggest  conservatives in Russia. Because if we have managed to grow  something, however small, in the past two years, to get nearer  to an open society, to the market, to freedom of speech, and to  private ownership, our main task is to conserve that. In  addition, we also support traditional conservative values --  stable legislation, support for order, and the fight against  crime...    [TRUD] Imagining a social cross-section of society, at what  levels do you see the potential members of your party?    [Gaydar] There are statistics about who voted for "Russia's  Choice." They are people with above-average education and  above-average qualifications, on average or slightly  above-average incomes. That is to say a stratum which in  civilized, developed market economies is called the middle class.    In Russia this middle class consists of skilled workers of  the free professions and small-time property owners. Only this  class, I am profoundly convinced, can become the staunch  mainstay of a stable society, of democracy and the market.    [TRUD] It is also, of course, the most creatively active  stratum of society. But it is not strong enough, it is not very  united, and it is eclipsed by lumpenized but well-organized  groups...    [Gaydar] You are absolutely right. That is indeed the  essence of the social, economic, and politic alternative with  which we are faced today. It is the choice between the lumpen  who has been told that the foreigner is his enemy and that if he  crushes that enemy and breaks through to the Indian Ocean, he  can have a pineapple in one hand and a banana in the other, and  the rational section of society which understands that there are  no free lunches.</p>

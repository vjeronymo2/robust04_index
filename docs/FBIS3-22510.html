			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Siri Antharin] </F>   [Excerpts] Today, the number of people in the northern  region of Thailand who have diseases of the eye, particularly  cataracts, is increasing. But there are very few hospitals,  either public or private, that are prepared to treat eye  disorders. Moreover, there is a shortage of equipment used in  conducting eye examinations, treating eye diseases, and  performing eye operations. There is also a lack of technical  equipment used in analyzing things to find the causes of the eye  disorders.    Because of this, those who need immediate medical attention  for an eye disorder risk damaging their eyes because they can't  obtain emergency treatment. They might even go blind. Besides  this, another very serious problem concerning this is that there  is a shortage of eye specialists or ophthalmologists. In Chiang  Mai, there are only ten ophthalmologists and 12 others who are  interns or who are studying to be ophthalmologists.    Looking at the number of hospitals that have the  capabilities  to treat eye disorders, it can be seen that there are only two  such hospitals in the north. One is the Maharat Hospital in  Chiang Mai City, a public hospital that the people refer to as  the "Flower Garden Hospital." The other is the Chiang Mai Saint  Peter's Hospital, which is the first private optometrical  hospital. This is now the most modern facility in the north.  [passage omitted]    Dr. Phithak Kitcharoen, the director of Saint Peter's  Hospital, is serving society in cooperation with the Lomoson  Foundation and various other organizations in the form of funds  to aid people with eye disorders. [passage omitted]    Saint Peter's Hospital has mobilized a number of elderly  ophthalmologists and some modern equipment and provides service  like a hotel. From a business standpoint, it will be a long time  before the hospital breaks even. This hospital has 23 rooms and  30 beds, including deluxe, special, and ordinary rooms. Within  several months of opening, it was crowded with patients even  though it provided services 24 hours a day. Thus, administrators  had to mobilize another 15 million baht in order to install  additional modern equipment.    Based on hospital reports, this hospital has treated  patients  from throughout the country, not just the 17 northern provinces.  All of those who have come here for treatment have serious  disorders. This is a sign that government units must quickly  take steps to deal with this situation before it is too late.  [passage omitted]    Dr. Phithak said that eye disorders are very worrisome  today.  This includes cataracts and glaucoma. In particular, the eyes of  a large number of farmers have been damaged by paddy ears or  leaves of certain plants without these people being aware of the  danger. When their eyes become irritated, they rub them or wash  them with water. When their eyes start to hurt a lot, they go to  a local hospital for treatment. [passage omitted]</p>

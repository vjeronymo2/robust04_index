			<p>BFN     [Text] A while ago, the 30th OAU conference opened at the  Palais des Conferences in Tunis. Egyptian President Husni  Mubarak announced the opening of this session in his capacity as  the outgoing OAU president. At the beginning of the session, he  called on South African President Nelson Mandela to occupy the  seat allocated for his country, thus marking the official  joining of this country to the African arena.    Over 30 heads of states are attending this summit, alongside  the secretary generals of the United Nations, Arab League,  Commonwealth Group, and about 400 journalists, representing  national, African and international media to cover the summit's  meeting.</p>

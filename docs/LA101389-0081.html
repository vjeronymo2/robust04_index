			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> Was it a missing piece of evidence from a recent cop-slapping trial in Beverly  Hills?  </P> <P> Paul Roberts, an instructor at Santa Monica College, was mowing the lawn in  Santa Monica the other day when he came upon a license plate with a 3-letter,  3-digit message.  </P> <P> The letters on the plate spelled out: ZSA.  </P> <P> However, a check of the state Department of Motor Vehicles reveals that it was  last registered to a Santa Monica resident. It was never, apparently, the  vanity plate of a Hungarian celebrity/Rolls-Royce driver.  </P> <P> Elapsed dining time for Cal Poly Pomona students gulping down a 185-foot-long  burrito constructed at the school Thursday: 20 minutes.  </P> <P> While some students of Southern California's culture have declared that the  Valley Girl phenomenon has passed, Kimberleigh Richards disagrees.  </P> <P> "Valley Girls are still alive and well," says Richards. "We just aren't the  same ones that Moon Zappa sang about."  </P> <P> Richards' Valley Girls group, based in Woodland Hills, is a 2-year-old  organization of transvestites -- men who on occasion dress like women.  </P> <P> "We want to reach out to cross-dressers who are scared to death that what  they're doing is wrong and that they are the only ones who do it," said  Richards, who publishes a monthly newsletter, Cross-Talk.  </P> <P> Transvestites "face real problems" appearing in public in some parts of the  country, Richards said. "Fortunately in L.A., it's not that big a deal."  </P> <P> Forty years ago this week, Tinseltown's most famous sign underwent a drastic  change. And pranksters weren't responsible. Instead, it was the Hollywood  Chamber of Commerce, which decided to refurbish the crumbling HOLLYWOODLAND  sign and update it by lopping off the LAND.  </P> <P> The landmark, built in 1923, originally wasn't associated with the movie  industry. Instead, as author Richard Alleman points out, it "represented the  one Hollywood business that is -- and always has been -- even bigger than show  biz: real estate."  </P> <P> The Hollywoodland development was advertised as being "above the traffic  congestion, smoke, fog and poisonous gas fumes of the Lowlands."  </P> <P> Sounds like the Lowlands could be hard on the eyes and lungs even in 1923.  </P> <P> Prices for Lakers and Kings game have been raised again this year. But if, once  you've purchased tickets at the Great Western Forum (formerly: the Forum), you  have no money left to purchase food, you shouldn't necessarily despair.  </P> <P> Great Western Bank ready-teller machines have been installed inside the arena.  </P></p>

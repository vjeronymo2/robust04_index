			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Arts: When political correctness is all - Television Last week's schedules were chock-a-block with Aids programmes. Tomorrow Channel 4 runs more than three hours of Aids programmes. But today there seem to be no Aids programmes, which is ironic because today is World Aids Day. Painfully slowly television's treatment of Aids is beginning to change, but it is an uphill move against entrenched dogma, amour propre and, most resistant af all, political correctness. Until recently the aim of most Aids programmes has been, first, to demonstrate the compassion of the producers and presenters, and, second, to prove that they are not homophobic. Dare to express the smallest reservations about their assertions that 'Aids is equally dangerous to everyone, heterosexual as much as homosexual' and you will be accused of homophobia. Knee-jerk response programmes are still being made. ITV's Speakeasy Aids Special on Friday, shown in London and the Midlands, simply began from the familiar set of assumptions, going out to a nightclub full of young people 'on the pull' to ask whether they were carrying condoms. They found just one who did, thus bearing out the recent report from a contraceptive manufacturer (who would doubtless like to increase sales) that only seven per cent of young people wear condoms with a new sexual partner. Had the natural journalistic response occurred to the programme makers, they might have asked: 'Why are people behaving in this way if it is really as risky as television has always said; could it be that we cried wolf five years ago when we claimed that within a short time everyone in a major city would know a heterosexual dying of Aids?' Instead they continued with their nudge-nudge, wink-wink routine: 'Would you have sex on a first date?' and 'Have you got a condom?' Aids In A New Light 93, also shown on ITV, this time late on Saturday evening, was an example of even greater laziness. Instead of making a programme about Aids in Britain, London Weekend bought a secondhand American programme about the situation in the US. After Elizabeth Taylor's introductory assertion that the rate of infection is rising sharply every day, especially among young people and women, other presenters, presumably famous in the US, came on to declare 'We gotta tell America]' and 'Americans are very sexy people]' This was not journalism, seeking to tell the truth, so much as propaganda endeavouring to make a case by selective assertion. The 'compassionate celebrity' way of covering the subject, with film stars and disc jockeys adopting deeply concerned expressions as they roll condoms on to their fingers, is presumably used because television does not dare to get to the nitty gritty of the Aids phenomenon: sexual practices which are not usually mentioned in polite society. Among the scores, probably hundreds, of Aids programmes so far screened I have never yet seen one which had the courage to say that (leaving aside infected blood banks and needle sharing) the disease appears to spread where you find (a) a group of abnormally promiscuous people (b) where anal intercourse is commonplace or even the dominant practice, the lining of the rectum being more prone to rupture than the lining of the vagina, allowing the spread of the infection into the bloodstream, and (c) where either drug abuse or old venereal diseases weaken resistence to Aids or even provide a vector for the new disease. Where these three factors coincide, whether among heterosexuals or homosexuals, Aids will spread quickly unless preventive measures are taken. As it happens such circumstances have arisen in western industrialised countries chiefly, if not exclusively, among the gay community. Hence 'gay plague'. The preceding paragraph is not a moral judgment, nor a condemnation of any group. It is a statement of the facts as perceived after reading everything about Aids that it was possible to lay hands on and which was comprehensible to the layman. But if you expressed it on one of television's Aids programmes there would be an outcry, not from the audience, but from the 'agenda setters'. These people - producers, editors, heads of television departments - believe that it is wrong to tell the public the truth about Aids because, in their view, the public is already appallingly careless about 'safe sex' and dreadfully homophobic. Tell viewers the truth and the heterosexual majority will take this as a signal to forget all thought of danger to themselves, abandon 'safe sex", and increase the persecution of homosexuals. In television today it is more important to be seen to be politically correct than to be seen to be truthful. And yet things are beginning to look up. To be fair there has always been one notable exception to the rule: from the beginning Joan Shenton, a lone independent producer, working with her own company, Meditel, has stuck insistently to the old idea of journalism, reporting whatever she finds. As with any subject where there is one overwhelming school of thought and a number of fringe dissenters you run the risk of becoming identified wholly and only with the dissenters. Because they are the underdogs and receive so little attention elsewhere you tend to concentrate on them in an instinctive attempt to right the balance, whereupon the dominant group anathematises you and drives you more into exclusive concentration on the fringe. This is no bad thing, of course, if you see your position as being like that of Copernicans under the Roman Catholic church or dissidents in Soviet Russia. Being told 'Any fool can see the sun goes round the earth and your denial makes you an atheist' or 'any fool can see communism works and your denial makes you a lunatic' must sound to Shenton very much like 'any fool can see HIV causes Aids, the pandemic in sub-Saharan Africa proves that homosexuality is not a factor, AZT is a useful treatment, and your denial makes you a homophobe'. Previously her work has been shown on Channel 4, but her Diary Of An Aids Dissident was screened on Monday by Sky News. It told us more about the propaganda war than about Aids itself, but the revelation that members of the Aids establishment are now so nervous that they try to suppress dissident publications suggests that we may be near to a breakthrough of the truth in the larger public domain. The weekend also brought The Broadcast Tapes Of Dr Peter, an edited version of a long sequence of brief reports made for Canadian television by Dr Peter Jepson-Young, who died of Aids last year. Watching the progress of the disease and this man's reaction to it was, surprisingly, a most moving and uplifting experience. He met blindness with apparent calm and set about learning to play the piano. He acquired a guide dog, then had to resort to a wheelchair with the dog trotting alongside. He organised a 'live will' and discussed the details of his own death with family and friends, joking about spending his final hours in a four-poster bed with velvet covers. His reports were not always so upbeat, but as an exhibition of the strength of the human spirit this was an extraordinary programme. Best of all, perhaps, in terms of journalism - though we shall have to see more before being certain - is Channel 4's set of four documentaries, The Plague, made by George Carey and Ann Moir, of the independent company Barraclough Carey. The opening episode, 'Zero Factor', looked back to the early 1980s and the emergence of a terrifying unknown disease among the homosexual communities which used the bath houses in California and Fire Island in New York. By tracking the people centrally involved (not just sufferers, but public health officials and volunteer workers) the producers created one of those real-life detective stories which are almost embarrassingly gripping, given that we know the outcome and the seriousness of the subject. If this series brings the same sort of workmanlike approach to such matters as the African phenomenon and even to the over-arching question of the relationship between HIV and Aids, then television will at last be able to start holding up its head in an area where, previously, it should have hung it in shame.</p>

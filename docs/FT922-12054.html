			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / French output falls 1% FRENCH industrial production fell by 0.9 per cent from January to February, a surprise to most analysts, who were expecting a small rise, William Dawkins writes from Paris. The fall is partly due to warmer than expected weather, which caused a sharp decline in energy use, said Insee, the state statistics body. The result brings the Insee industrial production index to 113.5, or 0.26 per cent above the 113.2 of February last year. Food production also fell, while manufacturing output rose by 0.6 per cent.</p>

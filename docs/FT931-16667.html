			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Record close after an erratic session INTEREST RATE optimism returned to encourage the London stock market on its first trading day of 1993, taking the FT-SE Index ahead to set an all-time high, but only towards the close of an erratic session. Dollar strength helped the blue chips, while pressure on the French franc appeared to increase the likelihood of interest rate cuts across the ERM countries, thus opening the way for the widely predicted cut in UK rates. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,861.5, up 15 points on the day at a new closing peak, which followed a trading record of 2,867.9 reached at mid-afternoon. But the morning session saw the Footsie down by more than 16 points in the face of weakening prices for UK government bonds. Dollar strength was broadly helpful across the range of international stocks but suggestions of demand for stock index futures was not borne out by trading specialists. Interest rate hopes, on the other hand, spurred the second line stocks ahead again vigorously, taking the FT-SE Mid 250 Index ahead by around 1.2 per cent to a fresh peak of 2,896.4. Increased demand for the Mid 250 second line issues is believed by many analysts to provide the clearest evidence to date of a genuine revival in confidence in the stock market and in the wider economy. Seaq trading volume jumped to 606.6m shares, still on the low side in spite of comparison with the 228.9m shares traded on New Year's Eve, when retail value, the true measure of equity market activity, reached only Pounds 383.6m, barely one-third of normal levels. Initial weakness in equities reflected warnings from some market strategists that the stock market rally could be challenged by rights issues as well as by increased government funding. Nervousness was also fuelled by the falls in government bonds and by perceptions that Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, had in a television interview expressed somewhat cautious views on the inflationary outlook in the UK. Market strategists remained optimistic towards the outlook for UK equities for this year, although several expressed relative caution over the short term. Hoare Govett, the UK securities house, saw a 'muted recovery' in the British economy, with a fall in base rates to 5 per cent providing a boost for equities by the second half of 1993. At Nikko, Mr Peter Thorne forecast a Footsie at 2,900 by March and 3,000 by the year-end, regarding possible weakness in gilts as the main danger to UK equities. On a global view, Nomura Research Institute Europe calls for an aggressive shift into equities, with the UK and Japan leading the way higher in the near term. Store and retail issues hung fire yesterday, awaiting details of the suggested buoyancy in Christmas trading. Some strategists believed that it was too early for any response from consumer spending levels to any economic improvement prompted by the devaluation of sterling. Overall, however, traders doubted whether yesterday's session reflected a return to full trading in the stock market. The Scottish funds, in particular, were thinly manned as a slow return was made from the New Year holiday, and the stock index futures market played a more subdued role than in recent sessions.</p>

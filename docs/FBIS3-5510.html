			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 8 KYODO -- Prosecutors are set to ask  the Diet on Tuesday [8 March] to waive the parliamentary  immunity which currently provides former Construction Minister  Kishiro Nakamura with protection from arrest, investigative  sources said.    Nakamura, 44, currently a Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)  member in the House of Representatives, is suspected of taking  10 million yen from leading general contractor Kajima Corp. in  January 1992, the sources said.    Nakamura is also suspected of using his influence as a Diet  member to head off a Fair Trade Commission (FTC) criminal  complaint against major contractors over alleged bid-rigging,  the sources said.    At the time, Nakamura was the deputy chairman of the LDP's  panel on the Antimonopoly Law. He served as construction  minister from December 1992 to August 1993 under then Prime  Minister Kiichi Miyazawa.    The prosecution's petition for Diet permission of arrest  will  mark the 15th time in postwar history that prosecutors have  sought to arrest a legislator during a Diet session and the  first since a 1967 scandal involving taxi operators in Osaka.    The House of Representatives will decide on the request to  arrest Nakamura after its steering committee considers whether  to approve it.    Investigators suspect Nakamura accepted the 10 million yen  from contracting giant Kajima in return for his efforts to  deflect the FTC complaint, which concerns a bid-rigging cartel  in Saitama Prefecture, just north of Tokyo, the sources said.    Nakamura has refused repeated requests by the Tokyo District  Public Prosecutors Office to appear for questioning regarding  his alleged receipt of the money, they said.    Diet permission is required for the arrest of a  parliamentarian while the legislature is in session. The Diet  is currently in a 150-day ordinary session that started in late  January.    On Monday, Tokyo prosecutors met senior prosecutors of the  Supreme Public Prosecutors Office and the Tokyo High Public  Prosecutors Office and decided to raid Nakamura's offices and  the Tokyo headquarters of Kajima, the sources said.    Prosecutors also plan to rearrest a former vice president of  Kajima, Shinji Kiyoyama, on suspicion of involvement in  delivering the money to Nakamura, they said.    Investigations show Kiyoyama approached Nakamura in the  summer of 1991, seeking his help in pressuring the FTC not to  file an accusation against a cartel of 66 construction firms  believed to have rigged bids on public works projects in Saitama  Prefecture, the investigative sources said.    Nakamura reportedly met then FTC Chairman Setsuo Umezawa,  62,  several times from the end of 1991 to early 1992 to discuss the  FTC's activities.    The FTC, which investigated the Saitama Prefecture  bid-rigging, announced in may 1992 it would not file an  accusation with public prosecutors, and instead ordered the  contractors to stop the bid-rigging.    Nakamura's alleged receipt of the 10 million yen could  constitute intermediary bribery under the penal code which says  public officials cannot receive money for influencing other  public officials, investigative sources said.    Recipients of such a bribe can be punished with up to five  years imprisonment, according to the penal code.    Kajima's Kiyoyama, 67, has already been charged with giving  a  20 million yen bribe to then Ibaraki Gov. Fujio Takeuchi in  December 1992.    A series of scandals involving major contractors has so far  led to the arrest of two governors, two mayors and 29 leading  executives of eight construction firms.    The arrest in March 1993 of LDP kingmaker Shin Kanemaru led  to the contractors' bribery scandal. Kanemaru has been charged  with evading a huge amount of taxes on his undeclared incomes  which were mainly secret donations from contractors.</p>

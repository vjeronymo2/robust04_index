			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KLVANA CASE PROMPTS NO REFORM IN MEDICAL REVIEW  </P> <P> An internal inquiry into how state medical authorities handled an investigation  of Dr. Milos Klvana, a Valencia obstetrician recently convicted of murder,  found no need for major institutional reforms, officials said Thursday.  </P> <P> "Overall, I would say the system is adequate," said Dr. Rendel Levonian after a  meeting of the Medical Board of California. Levonian, a Whittier surgeon, is  chairman of the board's medical quality division.  </P> <P> Klvana was convicted Dec. 18 by a Los Angeles Superior Court jury of  second-degree murder in the deaths of eight infants and a fetus.  </P> <P> An internal inquiry was prompted after Klvana's prosecutor said the medical  board failed to act against the doctor's license, despite being aware of his  incompetence.  </P> <P> The prosecutor, Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Brian R. Kelberg, has  called for changes in board procedures that he said rely on the opinions of  physician consultants.  </P> <P> Kelberg said the board's consultants frequently accepted Klvana's version of  events in an atmosphere of "collegiality" that hampered the investigation.  </P> <P> At Thursday's meeting of the Division of Medical Quality, which is a  seven-member arm of the board that oversees enforcement, board Executive  Director Kenneth J. Wagstaff differed strongly with what he described as a  public perception that "the fox is guarding the henhouse." Board investigators  -- not consultants -- decide whether cases should be pursued against doctors,  he said.  </P> <P> But Kelberg, the head of the district attorney's medico-legal section,  responded in an interview that the board has "problems that have to be  attacked." The medical consultants should be replaced with people who have  legal as well as medical training, he said .  </P> <P> Klvana was convicted because he proceeded with out-of-hospital births in cases  with high-risk prenatal and childbirth complications, despite knowing that he  had neither the medical skill nor the facilities in his clinics to perform them  safely. The newborns died between 1982 and 1986 during birth or shortly  afterward.  </P> <P> Klvana, 49, is scheduled to be sentenced Monday. Kelberg is seeking a sentence  of 53 years to life in prison.  </P> <P> The most notable example Kelberg cited in his criticism of the medical board  involved the 1983 death of Amanda Herrera. In that case, for which Klvana was  eventually convicted of murder, two medical board consultants believed Klvana's  assertion that he did not use a labor-inducing drug outside of a hospital,  according to board documents.  </P> <P> But an autopsy showed head injuries indicating that the infant died because she  was forced through the birth canal by drug-induced contractions, Kelberg said.  Board documents show that at least one of the board consultants knew of the  autopsy's existence.  </P> <P> One of the consultants wrote that although he believed Klvana's care to be  grossly negligent, "I would assume his practice in this case is no different  from many situations in the Third World where only marginal medical care is  available."  </P> <P> During the board meeting, Wagstaff did not mention the Klvana case by name. But  he referred to the "Third World" comment and said he plans to issue  instructions to all medical board consultants about the meaning of California  standards of health care.  </P> <P> "We don't use Third World standards," he told the board.  </P></p>

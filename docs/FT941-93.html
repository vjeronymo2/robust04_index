			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Bibby decision questioned J Bibby &amp; Sons faced questioning from shareholders at its annual meeting over the sudden decision a month ago to put a proposed demerger of part of the group on ice, while an offer for one of the businesses from Associated British Foods was considered. Bibby - 79 per cent owned by Barlow Rand, the South African industrial group  -had announced last October that it would float three of its activities - science, paper and agriculture - in a new group. The demerged group was estimated to be worth Pounds 75m. The cash raised would cut debt which stood at Pounds 122.8m at the September year end. ABF is interested in the agriculture division. At yesterday's meeting Mr Richard Mansell-Jones, chairman, said the talks with ABF were continuing and an announcement would be made in due course.</p>

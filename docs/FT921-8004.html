			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Hong Kong (9): Busy gateway to China  -Hong Kong is the most developed gateway into China, with travel companies and hotels in the colony offering a range of tours, tickets and services. It is probably quicker to get a visa in Hong Kong rather than apply early in one's home country, writes Angus Foster. LO WU was once no more than a rickety bridge across the Shenzhen river, where visitors  - lucky enough to have permission - left the comforts of Hong Kong and came face to face with the suspicions and aggression of Chinese communism. Now, more than ten years after China opened to the world, a new multi-storeyed Customs Hall greets foreigners flush with travellers cheques and 'compatriots' from Hong Kong or Taiwan laden with presents for mainland relatives. Suspicions have been replaced by indifference. More than 30m people passed through Lo Wu last year, some of them Hong Kong residents commuting daily to factories in southern China. As the country continues to try to attract foreign businessmen and tourists, travelling within China has never been easier. Hong Kong is the most developed gateway into China with travel companies and hotels in the colony offering a range of tours, tickets and services. Visitors can also deal direct with China Travel Service (HK), a Chinese state-owned organisation which oversees visas, bookings and reservations. Visas can be processed in less than a day and cost between HKDollars 150 and Dollars 480, depending on processing speed and numbers of entries required. It is quicker, and probably cheaper, to get a visa in Hong Kong rather than apply early in one's home country. Many businessmen enter China on tourist visas since they are quicker to process. Business visas require a letter of introduction from a sponsoring organisation in China. As China has opened up, making travel arrangements has become easier and easier. Scheduled flights are now available between Hong Kong and more than ten Chinese cities and chartered flights are also popular. Even medium-sized destinations have foreign joint venture hotels which can be booked from Hong Kong. Travellers cheques and credit cards are increasingly accepted while the Hong Kong dollar, rather than the Chinese renminbi, is sometimes the only acceptable currency in the south. Visitors to China usually head for one of three initial destinations; Guangzhou, or Canton in the Pearl River Delta near Hong Kong; Shanghai, China's largest city; and Beijing, the capital and home to all ministries and political bodies. Generally, travel options decrease the further north you go. Links between Hong Kong and Guangzhou are very well developed. China Southern Airlines, part of state airline CAAC, operates three flights a day to the city which cost between HKDollars 400-Dollars 590 one-way and take 40 minutes. However, Chinese airlines are often frightening, despite recent improvements. Taking into account travelling times to and from airports, flying to Guangzhou is probably not much quicker than taking a train. Direct trains to Guangzhou leave from Kowloon and take just under two and a half hours. There are four each day and single tickets cost HKDollars 183. Tickets should be booked in advance through CTS. If the trains are full, travellers with time on their hands can take a Hong Kong train to Lo Wu, cross the border by foot then catch a train to Guangzhou from the other side. However, this can mean total travelling time of more than four hours because connections are sometimes poor. By far the most romantic route is by nightly ferry which arrives in Guangzhou early the next morning. Services on board are limited and you may find yourself sharing a compartment. Tickets cost HKDollars 150-Dollars 250, again available from CTS. Guangzhou is the natural launching pad for visits throughout Guangdong province, the favourite destination for Hong Kong executives doing business in China. It is also used by some business people as the place to plug into China's domestic travel network, some of which cannot be booked from Hong Kong. For example, flights from Guangzhou to other Chinese cities are cheaper than direct flights from Hong Kong. Sometimes, tickets are available on domestic flights when international flights to the same destination are full. However, the same safety questions apply and domestic services are rapidly filling up as the country becomes richer. Finally, extra time should be allowed in case your optimism about China's travel system proves unfounded. Shenzhen, just across the border from Hong Kong, opened a new airport last year and this provides another option for linking into the domestic network. Citybus, a Hong Kong bus company, operates daily bus services to Shenzhen airport which cost HKDollars 100 and take two and a half hours. From Shenzhen there are flights to Beijing, Shanghai, Kunming and Chengdu, although none are daily. Travellers headed for Shanghai have three options. The easiest is a flight on Dragonair, an airline specialising in China routes which is partly owned by Cathay Pacific. Dragonair has five flights a week to Shanghai, costing HKDollars 1,290 one way. If these flights are full, CAAC operates daily services on the two hour route. For less urgent engagements, a train from Guangzhou to Shanghai takes about 32 hours and leaves each morning. On overnight Chinese trains a sleeping berth (either hard or soft sleeper) is strongly recommended. Alternatively, ferries from Hong Kong to Shanghai depart roughly twice a week and take 60 hours. Enjoy the on-board swimming pool or, perhaps, the HKDollars 5,600 'presidential suite.' For Beijing, Dragonair flies five times a week and a one way ticket costs HKDollars 1,850. CAAC flies daily. Trains are not an option, unless you have three clear days  - two for travelling and one to recover. Businessmen needing interpreters are often better off making arrangements after arriving in China through their hotels. CTS can arrange interpreters, which cost around HKDollars 2,000-Dollars 4,000 a day plus expenses, but they are unlikely to be able to cover technical topics.

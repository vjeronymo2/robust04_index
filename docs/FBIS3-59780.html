This was discovered as a part of the research to establish an  industrial process for synthesizing PPS directly from aromatic  compounds such as sulfur chloride, xylene, and diphenyl sulfide.  This makes possible the production at one tenth the present  price of PPS if produced on the same scale as existing plants.  Super molecular weight PPS which was synthesized with a new  method via polysulfonium can be processed into a transparent  film or fibers; moreover, polysulfonium as a stable intermediate  product is expected to have many applications such as  photoresist, temperature sensors, polymer alkyl reaction  reagent, and ion exchange resin.    The research group of Professor Tsuchida discovered an  oxidative polymerization reaction system where PPS can be  synthesized at a yield of nearly 100&percnt; when xylene and  sulfur  chloride are reacted at normal temperatures and normal pressures  in the presence of trace quantities of vanadyl compound under an  air flow.    Characteristics are that the polymerization reaction  progresses at room temperature, byproducts are not produced, and  high purity PPS can be synthesized. Prior research confirms that  it is sufficiently used as a low cost, practical process with a  simple method which can produce it just by mixing two compounds.    On the other hand, it was confirmed that it was possible to  synthesize selectively a useful disulfide compound by  suppressing the oxidation process with aromatic compounds and  sulfur chloride in the same reaction. When the bis(4-bromophenyl  thiophenyl)disulfide attained with this method is polymerized,  the synthesis of super molecular weight PPS becomes possible.    Furthermore, the method to synthesize amorphous, super  molecular weight PPS was newly discovered from the new synthesis  reaction system to be the initial source of sulfide compounds.    The characteristics of this system are the point of making  polysulfonium which is soluble in the solvent be the source  material, that it is easy to grow high molecular weight bodies,  and that the methyl radical can be simply removed from the  polymer formed. Thus, the super high molecular weight PPS with a  molecular weight of about 250,000 was successfully synthesized.    Since this PPS can be produced at room temperature unlike  prior products from prior research, it was confirmed that it is  amorphous and its processing into films or fibers is simple.    Also, with this method, sulfide and sulfonium are  alternately  connected via the phenyl radical and the synthesis of  polysulfonium having a very high, super polarized structure  became possible. Because this material has optical and  electrical properties, much is expected of it as a new material.</p>

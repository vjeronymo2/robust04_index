			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Burmese junta meets Suu Kyi The leaders of Burma's military junta yesterday met Ms Aung San Suu Kyi, the detained pro-democracy campaigner, in the first such face-to-face talks since they placed her under house arrest five years ago. Gen Tan Shwe, head of the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (Slorc), and Lt-Gen Khin Nyunt, the powerful chief of military intelligence, were shown on state-controlled television meeting Ms Suu Kyi at an official guest house in Rangoon. The commentary described the talks as cordial but no further details were released; it was apparently the first time she has been let out since being held. Burma's military rulers are attempting to liberalise the economy after years of stagnation while trying to improve their international image. The economy is growing with the help of Singaporean, Thai and other foreign investment, but efforts to regain international respectability have been hampered by repeated human rights abuses. The armed forces killed hundreds of people when they crushed a pro-democracy uprising in 1988, and then ignored the results of an election in 1990 won overwhelmingly by Ms Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy. The origins of yesterday's meeting lie in a trip to Rangoon in February by Mr Bill Richardson, a US congressman and ally of President Clinton. He became the first foreigner other than her relatives to meet Ms Suu Kyi and said then she and Gen Khin Nyunt would determine Burma's future. Reconciling the two sides, however, will be not easy. Ms Suu Kyi, daughter of Gen Aung San, the man who led Burma to the brink of independence from Britain, says she respects the army as an institution, but she has refused to leave the country as demanded by the Slorc and insists on the need for democracy.</p>

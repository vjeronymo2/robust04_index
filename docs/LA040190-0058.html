			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COVERAGE OF PERRIER'S PROBLEM WAS OVERBLOWN  </P> <P> Gerald C. Meyers' "Perrier's Crisis Mismanagement," Feb. 25, unwittingly  provided a source of high hilarity that was much needed in the Southern  California French colony.  </P> <P> His article is laughable because it covers -- with the help of an enormous  drawing -- an unwarranted space in the Business section.  </P> <P> Why so much fuss when much more important news, such as the production of  lethal gases by Libya, gained much less publicity?  </P> <P> Could it be envy at Perrier's excellent promotion in the United States, only  second to the arrival of le Beaujolais Nouveau? Or the fact that Perrier  controls so many American bottled water companies? Without the discovery of  infinitesimal traces of benzene, who would have known about Perrier's vast  control of the bottled water business?  </P> <P> Most European articles on l'Affaire Perrier agree that Perrier management did  an excellent job of human relations. Some even said the $35-million recall  would prove to be a good publicity investment and that the company will come  out of it smelling like une rose, perhaps what the illustration meant.  </P> <P> JACQUES M. POLETTI  </P> <P> Secretary-Treasurer  </P> <P> Union of French People Abroad  </P></p>

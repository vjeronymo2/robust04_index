			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Arts: Kissin in concert - Weekend music in London The Philharmonia's concert on Thursday, conducted by Leonard Slatkin, had something for almost everyone - a nearly new work by James Macmillan, his Sinfonietta, as well as a neglected Shostakovich symphony (the Sixth) and a rare appearance in London of one of the most exciting pianists of the younger generation, Yevgeny Kissin (reviewed in recital above by David Murray). Kissin is still only 21; Russian born, he made his British debut in 1987 at the Lichfield Festival. His reputation here rests largely upon a handful of recordings (including the First Tchaikovsky Concerto with Karajan, some Brahms, Liszt and Schubert's Wanderer Fantasy) which readily distinguished him from current excellent keyboard technicians as a pianist who evidently regards his extraordinary dexterity as a means to a carefully considered end rather than as an accomplishment in itself. Certainly his reticent platform manner and uncomplicated keyboard style implies thoughtfulness, and positively belies the glittering panache of Kissin's playing; the clean-cut accuracy of his figuration and the perfectly weighted rhythmic emphases seem utterly natural. Prokofiev's Third Concerto, which he played with the Philharmonia, does not provide too many opportunities for profound contemplation, yet there was a sense that everything Kissin did was informed with a genuine musical purpose, that he listened acutely to what was going on in the orchestra and gave every passage a beginning, a middle and finally a structural function. By the highest standard the performance was fractionally short on excitement. There were no risks of any kind; never a hint of insecurity but no flashes of inspirational daring either. The support provided by the Philharmonia was always vigilant. Slatkin is a refreshingly straightforward musician, a selfless accompanist, an unfailing guide through the excitements and longueurs of a work like Shostakovich's Sixth, and a reliable presenter of unfamiliar scores. In fact Macmillan's Sinfonietta was not all that unfamiliar; it was first performed barely a year ago by the London Sinfonietta who commissioned it. At that premiere the single-movement work seemed thin on substance and almost complacent in its formal planning, and the expansion to full symphonic proportions (to which the programme note provided no clue whatsoever) is no help at all in disguising the flabby musculature and insipid melodic content.</p>

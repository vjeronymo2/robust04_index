			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Base rate rise 'on hold' after monetary meeting UK bank base rates appeared last night to be on hold for this month after yesterday's monthly monetary meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England. But higher interest rates in the months ahead remained a possibility after both men, in public comments before and after their 45-minute discussion, emphasised their commitment to low inflation as the best way to promote UK economic growth, competitiveness and job creation. Mr Clarke, in an interview with BBC radio's Today programme, made clear early yesterday that he and Mr George were at one in wanting underlying inflation, which excludes mortgage interest rates below 2.5 per cent by the end of this parliament. Mr George, giving a lecture on unemployment last night, told a City audience that 'timely - and in the end, smaller - increases in interest rates' were less likely to damage investment and industrial confidence than inflation. Neither the bank nor the Treasury would comment on the meeting. However, it is believed that Mr George did not press for an increase in interest rates this month. As the governor has been more insistent than the chancellor on the need for timely interest rate increases in recent months, it was assumed that yesterday's meeting decided to keep base rates at 5.75 per cent. The bank this week indicated that base rates would probably have to rise over the coming months. It detected a generally improved inflation outlook over the next two years, but warned of the danger of stronger price pressures. Nevertheless, its quarterly inflation report, published on Tuesday, shied away from advocating an immediate rate rise. Instead it concluded: 'It will be necessary to monitor these developments very carefully.' The Treasury's monthly monetary report, prepared for yesterday's meeting, listed the economic factors that might argue for or against a tightening of monetary policy. They remain finely balanced. The Treasury said underlying inflation fell to a new 27-year low in September. However, it added that monthly indicators of economic activity 'supported a picture of broadly based growth'. Mr Clarke made clear that he and the bank agreed on the need for low inflation. 'I am as keen on it as the governor of the Bank of England,' said Mr Clarke, referring to the government's target of having inflation in the bottom half of its 1-4 per cent range by the end of this parliament.

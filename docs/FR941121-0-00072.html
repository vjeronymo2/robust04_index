The notice of the draft permit shall state whenever this has been done.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) A comment period of longer than 60 days will often be necessary in complicated proceedings to give commenters a reasonable opportunity to comply with the requirements of this subsection.

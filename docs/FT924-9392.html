			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Aitken Hume declines AITKEN HUME International, the banking and fund management group, reported profits of Pounds 871,000 before tax for the six months to September 30. This compared with Pounds 2.57m last time, or Pounds 950,000 on a like-for-like basis after allowing for a pre-disposal contribution of Pounds 1.11m from the Bachmann Group, a Guernsey-based financial services company, which was sold in March this year. Profits were struck after exceptional charges of Pounds 266,000, including a Pounds 172,000 provision against future settlements of stock options for management of the NSR offshoot in the US. The previous outcome took in an exceptional credit of Pounds 510,000 following a refund of surplus funds from the UK pension scheme. Fund management in the US lifted profits to Pounds 1.55m (Pounds 1.06m) but UK and Channel Islands banking again lapsed into losses with a deficit of Pounds 71,000 (profit of Pounds 252,000), having incurred losses of Pounds 635,000 in the last full year. Earnings per share emerged at 0.83p (3.25p). The interim dividend is passed reflecting the need to conserve the capital base of the banking group, the company said. The previous year saw an interim of 0.5p but the final was omitted.</p>

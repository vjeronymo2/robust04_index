			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Observer: In the swim at Saatchis Australian Bill Muirhead may not care to be reminded of a touching story from his early days at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi. Not long after Muirhead stepped aboard 23 years ago, Maurice Saatchi was looking for a way to thank the promising new account executive. On the assumption that all antipodeans need swimming pools, Saatchi apparently dispatched someone to measure up the garden - of Muirhead's Bromley semi. Since risen to become chairman and chief executive of the group's London agency, Muirhead is again being rewarded for the good job he has done. Saatchis has just emerged top of the billings class among UK agencies for 1993 and Muirhead is now off across the Atlantic to knock heads together as chief executive of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi North America. A 'foreigner' on Madison Avenue is still something of a novelty and it remains to be seen whether Muirhead's abrasive style will be quite what is needed to help discourage yet more clients heading for the door of the struggling US operation. Many of the difficulties are structural anyway, with the biggest blue chips fundamentally rethinking their advertising strategies. Also, despite the best efforts of group chief executive Charlie Scott, there is still a pretty intractable overhead problem - a legacy of the good, or bad, old 1980s - as amply demonstrated by the Pounds 4m pay-off of Muirhead's predecessor, Bob Kennedy, after his 12-month crack at the job. Muirhead's own package, at least, is reckoned to be a good couple of swimming pools short of the Kennedy league.</p>

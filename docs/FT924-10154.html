			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / What future for Coal?: French lessons for the mining industry - One approach to pit closures THE government could look for useful lessons on its programme of pit closures in the slow programme of euthanasia being administered by France to its state-owned coalmines. Since the early 1960s France has lost 200,000 coal jobs - 35,000 of them in the past eight years - without creating a revolution. Two years ago, the last mine in the northern region of Nord Pas de Calais, historically the heart of the French coal industry, closed without a public murmur. Most of the remaining 17,000 jobs and all the remaining mines, in Lorraine on the Belgian and German borders and in Centre-Midi, southern France, will go by 2005. All that will remain by then will be a handful of coal-related businesses that still have a commercial future, such as the dozen engineering groups, construction businesses and compressed coalbrick makers now left in Nord Pas de Calais. Pit closures were greeted with misery and violence, but nothing on the scale of the demonstrations in central London last weekend or the 1984-85 national coal strike faced by the government of the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher. France's tradition of long-term planning has allowed it to bleed the industry to death in measured drops over the years, so that the drowsy victim has hardly felt a twinge. Former miners have also been anaesthetised by generous state compensation, and a total of FFr4.5bn (Pounds 530m) a year in pensions, housing and heating that will continue to be paid to their widows after they die. On top of that, Charbonnages de France the national coal board, receives FFr2.4bn a year in production aid to keep the surviving pits going until their closure deadline. The regions affected have also been handsomely compensated. A fifth of the state's total budget for local economic development has, for example, gone to Lorraine alone over the past five years, for spending on roads, business parks and job-creation schemes. However, France's long-term planning for coal has not been quite as smooth as it looks. As in the UK, there have been changes of heart over whether the coal industry should be allowed to die, merely shrink or be revived. Yet in the end, successive French governments could not ignore the fact that high mining costs and the country's relatively low-grade coal could never compete in the long term with cheaper high-grade imports from the US - France's biggest coal supplier - and Australia and Germany. The first decision to run down the French coal industry dates from the mid 1960s, but went through a reversal when the 1973 oil price shock momentarily made domestic coal look competitive again. Closures resumed in the early 1970s, when France launched what was to become Europe's most ambitious nuclear power programme, which now supplies three quarters of the nation's electricity. Another quick U-turn took place when the Socialists came to power in 1981 and ordered coal output to rise by a third by the end of the decade, only to revert to the closures in 1984, under the pressures of falling prices of coal and oil imports. The new government had in any case abandoned its early experiment with go-it-alone economic expansion and changed to the budgetary rigour it has followed since. Being able to plan job losses over the long term has enabled the French coal board to avoid redundancies since the closures got under way again in 1984, says Mr Francis Asseman, its secretary-general. Most of the job losses since then have been achieved by early or natural retirement, plus a freeze in recruitment. That is not the whole story, however. France's treatment of its ex-miners is generous even by the standards of their colleagues in other troubled industries such as agriculture, cars or steel. That is partly due to the sheer weight of the coal industry, but also because the government recognises that miners, by the nature of their jobs, find it less easy to adapt to other work. Electricite de France, the electricity board, for example, has an agreement to employ a quota of ex-miners, while those who want to work in other industries qualify for a grant of up to FFr300,000, plus free training. The French coal board also helps former miners look for new jobs and pays their salaries for a two-month trial with new employers. Foreign companies are one of the main sources of new jobs, attracted to Nord Pas de Calais and Lorraine by generous regional aid, low labour costs and the good communications in those regions. On top of that, there is a small venture-capital fund, Sofirem, launched in 1967, which invests roughly FFr100m a year in business start-ups or the expansion of existing companies. It has a FFr1bn portfolio of small-business equity stakes and also helps potential entrepreneurs to present their cases to bank lenders. Sofirem works closely with FIBM, an industrialisation fund run by the coal board, which subsidises the creation of business parks and factories and the acquisition of machinery. Some of FIBM's clients are also funded by Sofirem. Mr Richard Muller, head of industrialisation for the Houilleres (coalfields) du Bassin de Lorraine, reckons that the system costs the public purse about FFr100,000 for each job created and that the failure rate of Sofirem-helped businesses is about 15 per cent. He observes: 'On an international comparison, we think that is pretty reasonable.'</p>

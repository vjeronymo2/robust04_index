			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Rhetorical Strikes"] </F>   [Text] NATO's threats against the Bosnian Serbs have long  failed to convince. Thus they have also failed, dismally, to  deter. The leaders of NATO's states, in a communique issued in  Brussels yesterday, reaffirmed their "readiness to carry out air  strikes if necessary." Virtually identical to the one issued  last August, it is hardly the mother of all threats. Its  timorous scale and unimaginative contours mark once more the  shabbiness of NATO's policy on Bosnia.    The problems of that ravaged state are many. Four command  immediate attention: the Serb siege around Sarajevo, mounted  from the hills that strangle it in their embrace; blockading in  Srebrenica, a so-called safe haven, of Canadian United Nations  troops; the closure of Tuzla airport to relief flights; and the  continued, brazen breach of the "no-fly zone" by Serbs and  Croats. Empty, unfocused threats are unlikely to force changes  in Serb and Croat policy. They will only nourish the cosy sense  of violent accomplishment that now prevails, especially in the  Serb camp.    Any action taken now, however effective and committed, will  be several thousand lives too late. That, however, should not  excuse further pusillanimity. NATO must identify specific  objectives, lay down crisp ultimatums, and deal firmly with  failures to meet them. The Serbs must be given a week to  "unlock" Tuzla airport. Humanitarian aid to thousands depends on  access to its runways. A similar deadline should be imposed for  the release of the Canadian contingent, to be relieved by its  designated Dutch successors. Failure to meet these demands  should earn the Serbs punitive air strikes. As for breaches of  airspace in the "no-fly zone," the response must be swift.    Most pressing of all is the siege of Sarajevo, and the need  to act there is the greatest. But the problems of that city did  not begin yesterday, and NATO has squandered the many chances it  had to intervene. Air strikes, while serving as effective  responses to specific, and localised, examples of aggression,  are not the answer. In fact, the mightiest minds now despair of  ever finding a solution.    This frustration was evident in President Clinton's language  on the matter at the NATO summit. "If you lack the  determination to deliver what you have promised," he said "do  not make promises." In the context, with all its expectations  of diplomatic cuddling and kissing, this was a stinging rebuke  to Europe's leaders. It is criticism that they richly deserve.  Their threats to use force have degenerated to the level of  pure rhetoric, of empty sabre-rattling, devoid of deterrent  effect and credibility. The Serbs know this, as they pound  Sarajevo daily, and mercilessly. The Croats know this, too.  And, most damningly, the Bosnian government has long since lost  hope. This explains, in part, its determination to gamble  everything on renewed military offensives against the  increasingly vulnerable Croats. It is tired of promises and  expressions of solidarity.    Mr Clinton spoke his mind and he must be congratulated for  that. If it means an end to vacuous rhetoric, then some good,  and some truth, might be said to have emerged from the NATO  summit.</p>

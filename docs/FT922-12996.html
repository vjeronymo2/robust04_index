			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / International Company News: JP Morgan advances 10% JP MORGAN, the New York-based banking group, yesterday reported a 10 per cent increase in first-quarter earnings to Dollars 299m. It attributed the rise to strong growth in net interest income and buoyant corporate finance revenues, which helped offset a Dollars 50m trading loss on mortgage-backed securities (MBS). The loss in the MBS market - incurred because of a surge in home-mortgage refinancings and a small but unexpected increase in mortgage interest rates  -contributed to a 63 per cent decline in securities trading revenues, to Dollars 165m. The trading loss led to the resignation last month of the company's senior MBS trader. Total earnings from trading were also hit by less favourable conditions in global interest rate and currency markets, although revenues from trading equities and commodities, including those related to Latin America, rose. Despite the MBS setback and generally weaker trading figures Morgan reported its second best quarter ever. Lower short-term domestic interest rates and a steepening in the dollar yield curve lifted net interest revenue 30 per cent to Dollars 414m. Morgan also earned Dollars 10m from interest on Brazilian medium- and long-term non-accrual loans. Corporate finance contributed Dollars 97m during the quarter in the wake of higher corporate debt and equity underwriting volume, especially in Latin America. Operational service businesses delivered Dollars 99m. Investment management fees brought in Dollars 85m.</p>

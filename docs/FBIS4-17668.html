			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by political researcher Artur Belous: "With What </F> Will the New Parliament Begin?"]    [Text] In my opinion, a party system of so-called  "political pluralism" has been established in Ukraine. Such a  system is characterized by the existence of a political center,  with ultraright and ultraleft oppositions. A political center  is usually formed by social-democratic, liberal, and  conservative parties and movements; the leftist opposition by  communists; and the right is represented by neofascists. The  stability of this system, and thereby the integrity of the  political basis of the state, is entirely dependent on the  centrist parties which form the bodies of power. When the  centrist parties weakened in Italy during the 1970's, ultraleft  "red brigades" unleashed their terror. In contrast, the ruling  right-centrist coalition in modern France set a reliable barrier  to the ultraright National Front headed by the notorious Le Pen.    Preliminary results of the legislative elections in Ukraine  show a relative weakness of the center. The Interregional Bloc  of Reforms [MBR] (Kuchma-Hrynoyv bloc) can be called a centrist  one. "Pure" MBR members will receive no more than 20 seats. We  can expect that 30-40 "independent" deputies will join them.  The second part of the center is represented by the party of  power. Their number of seats varies from 60 to 70, with an  additional 20-30 "independent" lawyers, economists, and  entrepreneurs. Therefore, the center is amorphous and resembles  "a bog" more than the basis of our state's legislature.    To the right of center there is the national-democratic  bloc,  of which Rukh is the leader, having 28 "pure" Rukh deputies and  around 10 Rukh-sympathizers. Uniting with representatives of  various parties, the national democrats will likely establish  the so-called Supreme Council 2, with 60-70 deputies.    The ultraright Ukrainian National Assembly and Ukrainian  National Self-Defense and Khmara's Ukrainian Conservative  Republican Party won five seats, and will hardly pull any  strings in the legislature. The ultraleft -- communists, who won  86 seats -- are dangerous. Closer to the center are socialists  (14 seats) and "agrarians" (18 seats). Slogans advocating the  restoration of the USSR, which characterized election campaigns  by communists in Donbass, question the "system" character --  respect for the fundamental basis, first and foremost, of our  statehood -- of the revived Communist Party of Ukraine.    With what will the new legislature begin? With elections of  its speaker, his deputies, and committee chairmen, because no  force has a majority, "independent" Ivan Stepanovich Plyushch  has a chance of becoming twofold champion in the legislative  game. Communists will likely head up to two-thirds of the  commissions and bear no responsibility for the formation of the  government, which will likely remain unchanged, or change only  slightly, pending the upcoming presidential elections.    The key issue is presidential elections. Leonid Makarovich  has a weak lobby (a little over 10 presidential representatives  have been elected deputies). In addition, some presidential  agencies, having erroneously forecasted the nonelection of the  required number of deputies -- which is sufficient for the  normal work of the legislature -- have rendered clumsy  assistance to the president, who was only once doubtful of the  possibility of electing a legislature. Currently, simply out of  a spirit of defiance, many deputies will not fail to remember  all this.    However, external influences can work in favor of a possible  subjective presidential wish to "postpone" elections. First,  many potential candidates will wait for the beginning of the  elections. A month and a half is not sufficient time to conduct  a campaign (the legislature will begin its work on 10-15 May,  while presidential elections are scheduled for 26 June).  Secondly, the voting could be postponed until fall because the  Rukh and other parties are not ready for the elections. This  unreadiness will be masked by truly necessary constitutional  changes to specify the powers of a newly elected head of the  state. In addition, communists, who favor the liquidation of  the post of president, will also play their part here. In  addition, though Ivan Stepanovich favors the holding of timely  elections, he cannot but consider the opinion of his supporters  from the local soviets, who wish to shift the elections to  prolong their existence and "resolve" issues of ownership.  Leonid Kuchma, who ranks first in popularity polls, could always  oppose the shifting of elections, but he will hardly have  majority support among the new legislators.    Given the legislative and presidential elections, we have  forgotten about the election campaign for local representative  organs. The battle will hardly be any easier because control  over property remains the key issue. I would like to hope that  a new legislature will have enough willpower to change the past  legislature's decision and limit direct elections for the heads  of local administrations in towns, villages, and settlements,  thereby leaving only the opportunity to nominate executive heads  in rayons and oblasts. Otherwise, Ukraine will face the danger  of irreversible decentralization. However, the leftist bloc  (more than a third of all deputies) will hardly assist in  preventing the soviets' next round of attacks.    Finally, Ukrainian membership in the CIS economic union can  become a key issue in the new legislature. The MBR members  (potential partners of the national democrats in domestic  economic reforms) could unite with communists and socialists.  It is easy to foresee that many lances will be broken over the  CIS economic union, which has value on paper rather than in  reality.</p>

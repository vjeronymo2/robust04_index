			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Russia takes a tumble from ranks of leading 25 traders THE countries of central and eastern Europe, excluding the former Soviet Union, expanded trade with the west last year for the first time since beginning their transition to market economies, Gatt said. While ground-breaking market access agreements signed with the European Community in March last year were credited with part of the turn-around, Gatt noted that western European countries boosted their sales to the east even more strongly. Meanwhile, Russia's trade continued to tumble. Exports to the west in 1992 amounted to just Dollars 27.6bn (Pounds 19.4bn) - down 25 per cent from Dollars 36.8bn in 1991. Imports fell similarly, from Dollars 25.6bn to Dollars 20.2bn. This trade disruption pulled Russia out of the world's top 25 traders, despite its dominant position in the trade of the USSR which ranked in the top 20 exporters in 1991. 'To put this in perspective, Russia exported less than Norway, and imported less than Portugal,' Gatt said. The value of exports from the region as a whole fell 10 per cent to Dollars 85bn (after a 25 per cent fall in 1991). But this was entirely due to a 25 per cent fall in exports from the Commonwealth of Independent States to Dollars 35bn. In contrast, exports from the central and eastern European states of Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania and the Czech and Slovak Republics, when taken alone, rose by 10 per cent to Dollars 48bn. This was a rebound from a 14 per cent fall between 1990 and 1991 which swept exports down to Dollars 43.6bn. Western Europe's trade grew strongly with the region. Purchases from central and eastern Europe rose by 20 per cent between 1991 and 1992. Exports from the Czech and Slovak republics leapt 63 per cent from Dollars 6bn to Dollars 9.8bn, while exports from Romania jumped 43 per cent to Dollars 2.8bn. Main gains came in food products, steel and clothing, all products which are quota limited by last year's 'Europe agreements'.</p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Postcodes go to market Marketing directors who fret about the effectiveness of their companies' direct mail campaigns have a new weapon in their armoury - the ability to profile their customer database by financial as well as socio-economic type via the postcode. A joint agreement between Infolink Decision Services and GB Mailing Systems has led to the launch of GB Profiler with Define, a software module that links the UK's 1.4m postcodes in the GB Address and AddressPlus postcoding software packages to the Infolink Define consumer market segmentation system. Define enables marketers to profile an area's financial and socio-economic background using regularly updated information from Infolink's consumer credit database. Infolink says the implications for in-house database management and for the effectiveness of direct mail campaigns are enormous. Infolink Decision Services: UK, 081 686 7777.</p>

			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Barr board casts doubt on voting strength of rebels The family feud at Barr &amp; Wallace Arnold Trust intensified yesterday as the board of the motor and leisure group cast doubt on the power of the rebel shareholders. The board claimed that the rebels, led by Nicholas and Robert Barr, have overstated their control of ordinary voting shares, some of which are held in trusts. The Barr brothers say they control almost 30 per cent of ordinary shares, and claim support from shareholders owning another 20 per cent of voting shares, including Mr Kerry Firth, a Barnsley-based businessman. It emerged yesterday that the Takeover Panel had interviewed the Barr brothers and Mr Firth last week. The brothers are calling for their uncle, Mr Malcolm Barr, who owns 16 per cent of the ordinary shares, to step down as chairman. They have also requisitioned an EGM to unseat Mr John Parker, chief executive, and Mr Brian Small, finance director. However, in a statement yesterday the board said it had 'substantive grounds for doubting whether Nicholas and Robert Barr had unfettered control over the exercise of voting rights for all the ordinary shares in their stated shareholdings'. The board has called a further EGM, to be held before the rebels' meeting, to enfranchise the non-voting A shares which are held almost entirely by institutions. It needs 75 per cent support among voting shareholders to succeed with enfranchise-ment, which would reduce family control from 55 to 18 per cent. A representative for the brothers said: 'We dismiss this latest pathetic salvo from the board with the contempt it deserves. 'We are confident that with our votes and the votes of our supporters that we can easily defeat the board's proposal for enfranchisement and carry the day not only then, but at the EGM the company has requisitioned on our own proposals.' On Wednesday the board warned that the motor side of the business could lose its distribution franchises if the rebels win control. The brothers, who are the sons of the late managing director, Mr Stuart Barr, plan to run the group's two divisions as stand-alone businesses.</p>

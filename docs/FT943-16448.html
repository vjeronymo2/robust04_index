			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Russia-Belarus trade pact Belarus and Russia signed a free trade agreement in a further move to draw together the economies of the two former Soviet states. The signing took place at the weekend during a visit to Belarus by Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister. Economic union has been opposed by some political groups in Russia because of the proposal to exchange the Belarus currency at 1-to-1 for the rouble, though it exchanges at 10-to-1 on the free market. Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister for the economy, said the trade agreement was 'an important step', but he was cautious on prospects for full unification of the economies. The ministries of finance and the central banks of the two states had been told to finalise plans for the union by the end of July. The agreement paved the way for similar talks with other states of the Commonwealth of Independent States.</p>

			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / France plans presidential primary Mr Charles Pasqua, the French interior minister, said yesterday he intended to present a bill enabling French political parties or coalitions to hold US-style national primary elections to select their presidential candidates, writes David Buchan from Paris. Responding to growing tension between rival presidential contenders within the ruling RPR-UDF coalition, Mr Pasqua told Le Figaro newspaper he wanted to prevent a recurrence in next May's presidential election of the split in the conservative vote that put President Mitterrand in the Elysee in 1981 and 1988.</p>

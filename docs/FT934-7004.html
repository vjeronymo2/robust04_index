			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / International Company News: Unscrambling a plate of tangled spaghetti - Andrew Jack examines the highly unusual and complex insolvency of Kwelm It is one of the biggest and most complex insolvencies ever. Last week it moved into a new phase, as creditors voted overwhelmingly for a scheme of arrangement under English law for the Kwelm insurance companies. At stake is the future of five insolvent insurance companies, themselves part of a far wider web owned by London United Investments, which is in administration. Other connected companies include Weavers, the insurance agency now in liquidation. 'This is either the end of the beginning or the beginning of the end,' says Mr Chris Hughes, head of insolvency at accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand and one of the joint provisional liquidators. Creditors to the different companies may receive initial dividends in the range of 3 per cent to 12 per cent by summer next year, and between 35 per cent and 47 per cent ultimately. But the process of running down the company is likely to take as long as 40 years, as many future claims continue to emerge. Kwelm is short for Kingscroft, Walbrook, El Paso, Lime Street and Mutual Reinsurance, five insurance companies which were created or acquired by LUI since the early 1970s. Most of the business they took on through Weavers was 'long-tail'. It was primarily North American insurance and reinsurance for professional and medical indemnity, product liability and directors and officers cover. From the late 1980s, adverse claims rose to the point at which they ceased underwriting new business, and then in 1990 instructed Weavers to stop paying claims on their behalf. After lengthy negotiations with creditors, the companies entered provisional liquidation in March 1992, except Walbrook, which entered the procedure in August that year. Collectively, the Kwelm companies have more than Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.3bn) in liabilities. Allowing for current actuarial estimates with a high degree of statistical confidence, the final figure may be as high as Dollars 9.1bn. Aside from the sheer size of the numbers in the accounts, work on Kwelm has presented substantial difficulties. At its peak Coopers was using the equivalent of up to 50 full-time staff. So far, the firm's fees have exceeded Pounds 7.4m, and its total costs, including legal fees, are Pounds 22m. Over the next three years it projects administration costs of Dollars 89m (Pounds 60m). Mr Hughes argues that the complexities justify the fees. Another sensitivity is the potential conflicts of interest, which are rife at Kwelm. Walbrook last summer became part of the Kwelm scheme partly because of creditors' concerns that there would be clashes in objectives if the LUI administrators remained in charge of managing Walbrook. Coopers has hired actuaries and accountants from its own practice to provide independent advice on the liabilities and the viability of the scheme. It is also, like the other large accountancy firms, a creditor to the Kwelm companies on professional indemnity. Mr Hughes says: 'We have to be sensitive to issues where there might be a conflict.' If he believes there is potential tension, he uses Mr Gareth Hughes, an Ernst &amp; Young partner, as 'scheme conflicts administrator'. One of the most time-consuming tasks has been reconstructing the records of the insurance companies in usable form. Many are stored in London warehouses on paper or microfilm. Even those on computer need modifying so each individual policyholder can be identified, previously a detail which only the broker needed. So far, that has led to the identification of more than 35,000 creditors. It will take many more months for the process to be complete. 'We have had to unscramble accounting information that is, crudely put, like a plate of spaghetti,' says Mr Hughes. To help grapple with the logistics of the proposed scheme, Coopers brought in one of its own project management consultants, Mr Jeff Morris. His previous job had been to co-ordinate the relocation of 5,000 Coopers staff as the number of London offices was cut from 13 to three. He created six teams to work on the preparations behind the scheme, including one to manage and invest Kwelm's considerable cash assets of more than Dollars 700m, which it must retain to pay out future claims. The presence of so much money makes Kwelm a highly unusual insolvency. Another team was geared to explaining the scheme to the 10 different types of creditor who had to approve it: those who were and those were not to benefit from the government's Policyholders' Protection scheme, across each of the five Kwelm companies. Now Mr Morris is planning the gradual run-off stage of Kwelm, most of which will be done by about 160 staff employed through Kwelm Management Services. That requires considerable investment in new systems, in re-establishing a relationship with the rest of the insurance market, and motivating staff. A job with a business which plans to close rather than grow may seem an unusual choice, but Mr Morris says: 'Job guarantees are very short-term these days. KMS has a life of at least 20 years.' 'There is a big job going forwards,' says Mr Hughes. Financial investigations are under way to trace assets, and litigation against both auditors and agents alleged to have misappropriated assets continue. The House of Lords still has to resolve exactly who will can benefit from the Policyholders' Protection scheme. It will also be some time before the effectiveness of schemes of arrangement for insolvent insurance companies has been reliably tested.</p>

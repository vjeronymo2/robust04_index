CBS'  game matches Syracuse and Penn State at 11 a.m. (Channels 2 and 8).  </P> <P> Mid-October is usually not the time for must-win situations in the National  Football League, but that's where the Rams (1-3) find themselves Sunday in a  4:30 p.m. game against the Chicago Bears (4-1) on KCAL Channel 9 and TNT.  </P> <P> Other NFL telecasts include the Cincinnati Bengals and Houston Oilers (10 a.m.,  Channel 4); San Diego Chargers and New York Jets (10 a.m., Channel 39); San  Francisco 49ers and Atlanta Falcons (10 a.m. Channel 8); New York Giants and  Washington Redskins (1 p.m. Channels 2 and 8) and Raiders and Seattle Seahawks  (1 p.m. Channel 36).  </P> <P> The Lakers' first telecast of the Mike Dunleavy era begins at 8 p.m. tonight  with an exhibition game against the Portland Trail Blazers on KCAL Channel 9  and KADY Channel 63.

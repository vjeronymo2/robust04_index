			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> STUDENTS FIND TRUTH, CONJECTURE IN TRASH;  </P> <P> SOCIOLOGY: THE MEMBERS OF A MAINE COLLEGE CLASS DREW GENERALLY ACCURATE  CONCLUSIONS OF LIFESTYLES BY SIFTING GARBAGE.  </P> <P> Stephen Hyatt wanted his University of Maine sociology students to understand  the important clues that can be contained in trash, so he turned them loose on  five big green trash bags right in his classroom.  </P> <P> The trash, collected and screened by Hyatt, included everything from food  scraps to lottery tickets, beer cans to shampoo bottles. The students came to  some accurate conclusions in most cases, and some wildly inaccurate conclusions  in others.  </P> <P> Hyatt's point was to show how everyday dumpings can provide broad details of a  civilization's day-to-day activities. In the past, he said, anthropologists  often concentrated on tombs that provided much information about a society's  upper class, but few details about the common people.  </P> <P> To control the exercise, Hyatt put the trash bags together himself, using trash  from his own home and from the homes of friends and neighbors.  </P> <P> "I assembled this trash for specific reasons, and in order not to detract from  the learning experience I washed all the cans and bottles so that all the trash  was relatively clean," Hyatt said.  </P> <P> Each bag of trash represented a hypothetical family, and each bag contained  specific clues about the family members.  </P> <P> The class was divided into groups, with teams of five students assigned to each  bag of trash.  </P> <P> "They examined the trash and tried to make some meaning of the contents," Hyatt  said. "Then each one was asked to make inferences about the trash."  </P> <P> Hyatt asked the students to draw conclusions about a number of specific  questions: the size of the household; the age, sex, health and occupations of  the members; and the food consumed by the different families.  </P> <P> "They were also to try to determine the social status of the household, whether  they were poor or upper class," Hyatt said.  </P> <P> What surprised Hyatt the most, he said, was the students' attention to food  scraps and other food-related clues. The students were also very conscious of  health-related clues, he said.  </P> <P> "They were very alert to that, pointing out that this person ate  low-cholesterol food or drank low-fat milk, and that surprised me," Hyatt said.  "It also surprised me how often they noticed evidence of food from McDonald's  or other fast-food places, pointing out that some of the fictitious families  usually ate well but slipped once in a while and ate fast-food."  </P> <P> Some students interpreted the discovery of aspirin and Tylenol bottles in the  bags as evidence that the people were living stressful lives and needed relief  from medication.  </P> <P> He said the students came to interesting conclusions about the lottery tickets  that he placed in the trash bags.  </P> <P> "Some said that the gambling was probably the result of feelings of poverty and  desperation," he said. "One student pointed out that a lottery ticket had been  purchased on Dec. 24, and said it must have been a sad Christmas Eve. He  related that to desperation, frustration and money problems."  </P> <P> The discovery of empty beer cans indicated that the male of the household was  drinking, even when the household obviously had both male and female members,  Hyatt said. Some students said it was an indication that the male in the family  was drinking too much.  </P> <P> "That surprised me in a way," Hyatt said. "Many people now would say that the  co-eds are drinking as much beer as the males, but the students seemed to think  that it indicated a male presence."  </P> <P> Hyatt designed his trash bags to represent economically well-off families. But  many of his students thought the families were poor.  </P> <P> "Most of them came to the conclusion that they were worse off than I had  intended," Hyatt said. "Many of them noticed evidence of clothes purchased in  discount stores, and thought that indicated poverty. They thought that buying  no-name food products indicated low incomes. They didn't think that it might be  a middle-class family that simply wanted to save money."  </P> <P> Hyatt said he plans to repeat the trash exercise in future classes. And at  least one student said the experiment will change the way she handles her own  trash in the future.  </P> <P> "I never believed that you could find out so much revealing information about  people simply by examining their trash," she wrote in her research paper. "From  now on I plan to destroy any personal information before throwing it out."  </P></p>

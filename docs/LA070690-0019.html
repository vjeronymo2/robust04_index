			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANT REVIEW;  </P> <P> A CULINARY PASSAGE TO INDIA AT TAZEEN'S  </P> <P> "You know, I've never had Indian food," warned the part-time volleyball star at  the exact moment she was sitting down.  </P> <P> "No problem," I said.  </P> <P> I wasn't worried. Tazeen's seemed supremely accessible, a place of light,  cheerful food and evocative spice aromas.  </P> <P> It looks rather like a coffee shop: white walls, coral chairs, Formica table  tops, a counter. There are movie-star photos on the wall, which seems apt since  it's only a block from MGM, except that they're all photos of Indian movie  stars. But Tazeen's is tiny, as crowding the part-time volleyball star and her  equally tall friends into one little booth demonstrated.  </P> <P> "There's nothing that will disgust you about Indian food," I said. "Well, there  are those Indian pickles, which have so many spices in them they're a little  bitter. But they're delicious, and there's one here you probably can't get  anywhere else: chicken pickle."  </P> <P> But Tazeen, the charming young owner of the restaurant, doesn't bring out  chicken pickle -- her aunt's recipe, she says -- unless you ask (it tastes just  like an ordinary Indian vegetable pickle, only made from chicken). And the  other things proved no problem for the volleyball crowd.  </P> <P> The vegetable samosa, for instance. No problem. It had the all-American  combination of peas, carrots, corn and potato. The aaloo bonda -- diced potato  deep-fried in thin batter -- had an exotic aroma of cilantro chutney; no  problem. Full meals start with a carrot-and-lettuce salad and a big, irregular  round of bread hot from the tandoor oven, like extra-thick pizza bread, only  slightly blackened here and there. It was a big hit.  </P> <P> Dinner entrees come with dal -- a little pot of either plain boiled lentils or  plain boiled yellow split peas -- and a vegetable. This is usually one of the  dishes from the menu's sizable vegetarian list: simple sautees, usually,  cabbage and tomatoes or potatoes and spinach, cheerily flavored with turmeric  and cumin. Some of the vegetarian entrees are more elaborate, like the eggplant  in a rich sauce of ground walnuts and tamarind.  </P> <P> The tandoori dishes were also perfectly unproblematic. Seekh kebab was your  basic ground lamb kebab flavored with onion and parsley. Chicken tikka, chicken  breast tenderized with a yogurt marinade, was bright with turmeric and cumin.  Mutter keema, sauteed ground beef with peas, likewise had lots of cumin and  turmeric. The volleyball crowd thought it tasted like very good ground beef  with peas.  </P> <P> But I wondered about the rest of the dishes, which were remarkable for their  subtle and unusual spicing. I was humiliated to say I had no idea what was in  the deceptively named chicken curry.  </P> <P> And what's in the aaloo ka salan? The sauce has an unprepossessing dull yellow  color, and may be thickened with ground onions, but beyond cardamom and clove I  can't guess what's in it. Nor have I a clue about haray masalay ka gosht, lamb  cooked very soft in a greenish sauce. The name means "meat with fresh  seasoning," referring to the cilantro in the sauce, but what's the rest?  Coconut? Asafoetida?  </P> <P> Surprisingly, the volleyballers had no trouble with these dishes. However, the  house specialty, lamb biryani, was a problem. This pilaf is mixed with lamb  fried very brown in the Central Asian manner, almost as intensely flavored as  beef jerky. I guessed its exotic aroma came from ground ginger, cloves, saffron  and something sweet and sour I couldn't make out.  </P> <P> The part-time volleyball star, however, sniffed at it and said, "Windex."  </P> <P> The blandest of the desserts -- a sort of milk-flavored gelatine called faluda  -- would probably be the perfect dessert to follow a spicy meal, if we'd  ordered our dishes hot. Saveeyan, very fine brown vermicelli in milk with  raisins, occasioned some critical comment ("Shredded wheat," was the  conclusion). Gulab jamun, however, was liked, and justly; this is one of the  freshest and least soggy versions of these condensed milk balls in syrup  around. The favorite was kheer, a very good, pretty liquid rice pudding with  cinnamon.  </P> <P> The very best dessert, to my way of thinking, was shahi tukray, a sort of bread  pudding in a rich spiced sauce of condensed milk. In this case there seemed to  be a layer of dried fruit in it as well, but the bright yellow sauce had that  same wonderful, magical spice aroma I'd tasted in the biryani.  </P> <P> The volleyball star, however, wrinkled her nose and pronounced an  incontrovertible verdict: "Windex." You can't win them all.  </P> <P> Tazeen's Indian Cuisine, 9748 Washington Blvd., Culver City, (213) 204-5136.  Open for lunch and dinner Monday-Saturday, dinner Sunday. No alcohol. Street  parking. MasterCard and Visa. Dinner for two, food only, $13 to $38.  </P> <P> </P></p>

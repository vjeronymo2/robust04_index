			<p>BFN     [Text] The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, has said the  Kashmir problem is the key for solution of all issues between  Pakistan an India and urged New Delhi to enter into dialogue for  its solution in accordance with internatinal law and aspirations  of the Kashmiri people. She was presiding over a meeting of the  Azad Jammu and Kashmir Council in Islamabad today.    The prime minister referred to the serious situation in  occupied Kashmir and assured Kashmiri brethren that the people's  government will continue its moral, political, and diplomatic  support for their just cause. She said under the UN Resolution,  India is a party to the Kashmir dispute and it is that country's  moral and international obligation to implement UN Resolution  and end tension in the region so that the two countries could  utilize their resources for the welfare of their people. She  said it is in the interest of India to give the right of  self-determination to Kashmiri people. She said India has  increased its budget for defense by 20 percent and this shows  its failure in Jammu and Kashmir despite massing six lakh army  and paramilitary forces.    The prime minister referred to the testing of Prithvi  missile  by India and the reported deployment of these missiles along the  Pakistani border. She said Pakistan has always adopted the path  of self-restraint, while India went for missile, nuclear, and  arms race. She said Pakistanis are a peace-loving nation and  would not take steps which could lead to arms race. She  condemned the Prithvi missile test by India and said by doing so  India was trying to change the status quo in the region. She  said if there is to be peace in the subcontinent it is essential  that Indian Government should reveal its missile program.    Ms. Benazir Bhutto said Pakistan fought three wars with  India  because of its support for Kashmiris and conspiracies were  hatched because of this support to divide Pakistan. She said  those talking of (?adoption) of independent Kashmir do not know  that Kashmiris and Pakistanis are one. She said this issue is  alive because of the sacrifices of Kashmiris and Pakistan's  support under [words indistinct] principle. She spoke of the  massive killings of Kashmiris by Indian forces and torture in  jails and urged the international community to take a serious  notice of these human rights violations.</p>

			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE TO CONTROLLING AIDS EPIDEMIC  </P> <P> As a health-care worker involved in the caring for AIDS patients, I'm aware of  the magnitude of the epidemic and the sad and painful result it leaves to its  victims.  </P> <P> For 10 years we have all been yearning for a cure and fast and caring action  from our government, but we got too little too late. President Reagan slept  while the epidemic spread and the number of dead increased. Now President Bush  had a chance to act and spell out his policies at the international AIDS  conference in San Francisco, but he refused.  </P> <P> President Bush, try visiting an AIDS hospice, sir. Maybe your human values will  change overnight.  </P> <P> ALAN B.A. BANGURA  </P> <P> Inglewood  </P></p>

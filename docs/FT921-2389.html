			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / South African blacks celebrate referendum results Blacks in Johannesburg  - above  - celebrate the referendum results before marching on police headquarters to demand an interim government. In Soweto, there was also relief at the outcome with residents saying they were more determined than ever to win the right to a vote, Reuter reports. In Cape Town, Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu said: 'Good sensible people must be breathing sighs of relief. The Conservative party and its neo-Nazi allies have eaten the dust in a way that is very satisfying.' He urged Mr de Klerk to move like 'greased lightning' in talks aimed at a non-racial democracy.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The brother leader of the revolution [Colonel  Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi] hosted a dinner banquet last night in  honor of Presidents Blaise Campaore, president of Burkina Faso,  Alpha Oumar Konare, president of the Republic of Mali, and  Mahamane Ousmane, president of the Republic of Niger, and the  delegations accompanying them. The banquet was also attended by  the secretary and members of the secretariat of the General  People's Congress, the secretary and members of the General  People's Committee, in addition to the heads of the diplomatic  missions accredited to the Great Jamahiriyah and a number of  army officers.    The brother leader of the revolution delivered a speech at  the banquet and began by welcoming the leaders of these Islamic  African states, Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso. The leader said  that the Libyan people welcome and appreciate the solidarity of  their African brethren and this solidarity reinforces the  position of the Libyan people in confronting the conspiracy led  by the three colonial western states.    The leader added: The triumph of the will of the peoples of  Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso strengthens freedom and democracy.  He also warned that the colonial western states are still  involved in creating problems and hardship for those countries  where the nationalist movements were victorious. He pointed out  that it has become clear that the colonial western states which  were accusing Libya of being behind the destabilization of the  African continent were in fact themselves working hard to  destabilize the situation in the African continent and prevent  the latter from building itself.    The leader further said: The peoples of the Third World,  whom  the colonial western states are trying to force to surrender,  have decided to resist and the West must understand this. He  added: The West is now using the United Nations, after it tore  up its Charter and trampled on its laws, as a neocolonialist  means in the same way it used the League of Nations in the past  to impose its mandate on the peoples of the Third World.    The brother leader warned: This trend which the western  states are entrenching is a dangerous trend for the peoples of  the world, will turn the world into a jungle, and will be  responsible for its collapse.</p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / IIC figures: Correction Due to an editing error, an article on Latin American infrastructure finance, on this page on April 13, incorrectly stated that the Inter-American Investment Corporation suffered loan losses in the 1960s. The corporation was not created until 1989. It has asked us to point out that it has suffered no loan losses to date.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, May 16 (TANJUG) -- A delegation of the  Serb republic (S.R.) in the former Yugoslav republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina met on Monday with an official of the  International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) for Bosnia,  Andreas Kun, to discuss an exchange of prisoners and the  stepping up of the ICRC activities in Pale, the administrative  centre of the S.R. Bosnian Serb Vice-President Nikola Koljevic,  who headed the delegation, said to reporters that the issue had  been discussed into detail, with a very concrete plan and lists  of names.    `We believe that talks on this subject are highly important  because they will be the first indication in the next few days  of whether an agreement on ending hostilities will be signed or  not,' said Koljevic.    The foreign ministers of Russia, the United States and the  European Union [EU] on Friday called the warring sides in  Bosnia-Herzegovina to sign a four-month truce which would give  them an opportunity to reach agreement on a territorial division  of Bosnia on the basis of the E.U. formula granting 51 percent  of the Bosnian territory to the Moslems and Croats, and 49 to  the Serbs.    The ICRC official said after the meeting that he expected  Bosnia's Moslem-Croat federation on one side and the Bosnian  Serbs on the other to show good will in connection with an  agreement on the exchange of prisoners. He insisted that visits  to prisoners should continue as well as the inspection of  condition in which they are held.    Health Minister Dragan Kalinic, who also attended the  meeting, said that the Serb side had insisted on getting  information about hundreds of Serb prisoners who have been held  captive in a silo in the Moslem village of Tarcin in central  Bosnia for more than a year. The talks also tackled the  question of 16 Serb doctors and medical staff in Sarajevo who  were last autumn prevented from being evacuated from the city  and whom the Moslem authorities arrested and sentenced to two  years in prison because of their alleged refusal to comply with  the work obligation, Kalinic said.</p>

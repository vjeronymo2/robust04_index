			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Survey of Portable Computers (2): Strong stimulus for further research in Japan - The large potential market for portable computers in Japan may provide the home platform' for manufacturers to make an even bigger impact in world markets THE international success of Japan's portable computer makers is an anomaly. In nearly every industry in which Japan has made an international impact, from cars to television sets, Japanese manufacturing companies have first established successful products in the home market. With the home base secure - often effectively closed to foreigners - and products well tested, they moved overseas, modifying products only slightly and achieving greater economies of scale in manufacturing. In portable computers, however, the pattern was reversed. Toshiba, formerly an also-ran in the Japanese computer market, in the last decade established a big presence first in Europe with its innovative IBM PC-compatible laptop computers, then in the US, and finally in Japan itelf. It was Toshiba's experience overseas that helped it crack the Japanese market, where it now claims up to a third of portable computer sales. Toshiba's experience is a reflection of the broader strengths and weaknesses of the Japanese portable computer industry. While Japanese PC-makers have built a strong presence in the international market for portables, they have not, as in some other industries, simply smashed the competition. Japan's technology for making computer hardware may be second to none, but for the export market Japanese makers still depend on foreign-designed operating systems and software that have not yet caught on fully in Japan itself. Japan therefore has not provided the kind of secure and stable market for computers that has supported other export industries. Indeed, Toshiba faces a constant struggle to maintain its market share everywhere. It is sometimes trumped by a new product offered by Compaq overseas, and in Japan it has failed to keep NEC, Japan's biggest PC-maker, out of its established territory in the portables market. While Toshiba enjoyed a 43 per cent share of the laptop and notebook computer market in Japan in 1989, this fell to 33 per cent in 1990, although its Japanese sales grew by 25 per cent to 250,000 units. In the current fiscal year, to the end of March, its market share is thought to have fallen again, with sales projected at 225,000 units, according to the company. In contrast to Toshiba's experience, NEC, the unchallenged champion of the Japanese market with over 50 per cent of desktop and portable PC sales, has made little impact overseas in PCs. NEC has been handicapped outside Japan by the lack of an internationally accepted computer operating system. NEC uses a proprietary Japanese language system that accounts for about 60 per cent of the Japanese market (including sales by Seiko Epson of compatible machines), but is completely useless overseas. The option of simply exporting what succeeded in the home market therefore never existed. NEC's domination of the home market has been eyed enviously by every other manufacturer, from Toshiba and IBM to Apple. Last year, IBM led 22 other computer companies in establishing a common operating system in an attempt to spur sales. The system, DOS/V, is a derivative of the MS DOS operating system used in IBM PCs worldwide. It can run software written for IBM PCs and also handle Japanese language applications. While the new operating system may eventually provide a stronger platform for the Japanese makers, it also provides an opening in the market for foreign makers who now need to make few adaptations to their machines to make them saleable in Japan. IBM has aggressively marketed in Japan its PC/55 notebook computer, which uses DOS/V operating system. Compaq is planning to boost its presence in Japan. Apple, whose sales of desktop machines in Japan have been rapidly growing, has also made a successful launch of its Powerbook notebook computer, which is manufactured by and designed jointly with Sony. And yet, in spite of all of this activity that challenges NEC, NEC's PC 9800 series computers so far appear unstoppable. Competitors admit that NEC's share of the market for portable computers continues to grow. According to NEC, its share of all PC sales now comes to 53 per cent, including 38 per cent of laptops, and 37 per cent of notebooks in the first half of 1991. With 4.84m PC 9800 series computers already delivered to the market, many customers are readily returning for smaller, more powerful versions of the same machines so they will not have to scrap old software and programmes. And while Toshiba was a leader in introducing powerful computers in a small package, the lead has now basically vanished. Toshiba's main selling point is that users will have instant access to an international body of software. Yet for most users, the 12,400 software packages available for NEC computers, plus the cost of switching operating systems will be enough to keep them buying NEC products. The good news for all the companies is that there is plenty of growth left in the market since the penetration of PCs in Japan has been much lower than in Europe or North America. NEC, for example, believes that only 20 per cent of potential demand has been taken up so far. The stunning improvements in the capabilities of notebook computers since they were introduced a few years ago has in itself been an important stimulant to demand in Japan. This is because full-sized desktop machines were often difficult to accommodate in crowded Japanese offices. In spite of the poor economic climate, domestic PC shipments were up four per cent in the six months to the end of October, while the market share for notebooks computers rose from 28.4 per cent to 31.1 per cent. Even though demand has probably fallen off in the subsequent months, the prospects for further growth in the portable end of the market will provide plenty of stimulus for computer companies to continue research into areas where they are already strong, including LCD displays, memories, miniature disk drives, batteries and miniaturisation in general. The Japanese market could yet provide the platform these companies need to make an even bigger impact overseas.</p>

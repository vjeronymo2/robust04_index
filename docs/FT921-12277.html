			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / International Company News: Outokumpu in FM750m deficit OUTOKUMPU, the Finnish group, said yesterday its 1991 loss before extraordinary items was about FM750m (Dollars 170m), compared with FM124m in 1990, Reuter reports from Helsinki. The company said it expected the group's result to improve 'notably' in 1992. Turnover rose 12 per cent to FM12.7bn in 1991. The end of 1991 was worse than expected. The last four months' result was weakened by FM250m due to a poor market situation, foreign exchange losses caused by the markka's devaluation and inventory losses on declining metal prices.</p>

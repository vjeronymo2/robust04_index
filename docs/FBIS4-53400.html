			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Dangerous Scheme" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, May 19 (KCNA) -- U.S. Secretary of  Defense William Perry recently declared the United States was  examining measures to step up preparations for an emergency  dispatch of aircraft carriers to the Korean peninsula and  increase the stockpile of ammunitions for U.S. Forces in South  Korea and Japan. A senior U.S. official even cried that a  "decisive position" would be taken in the U.S.-led international  action for a solution to the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK.    This shows the United States is very tenaciously working to  intimidate the Korean people with strength and strangle the  DPRK, says NODONG SINMUN today.    The news analyst continues:    The emergency dispatch of aircraft carriers and stockpiling  of larger quantities of ammunitions are measures that can be  taken only on the eve of war. Perry's statement suggests that  the United States is stepping up preparations for making a  military adventure against the DPRK any moment.    It is noteworthy that the United States is intensifying the  campaign to stifle the DPRK by force of arms over its "nuclear  issue."    The United States is leading the campaign of international  reactionaries to isolate and stifle the DPRK. This indicates  that the U.S. schemes to inveigle other countries in a possible  war it would provoke in Korea.    The U.S. is raising a hue and cry over the "nuclear issue"  of  the DPRK in an effort to find a pretext for a military adventure.    Strength and pressure never work on the DPRK.    If the U.S. warmaniacs make a military adventure in Korea,  they will have to pay dearly for it.</p>

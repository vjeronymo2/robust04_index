			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (23): Why users remain sceptical  -'Upgrades' An upgrade used to be a liberation sought by users. They were running out of space, they needed more capacity, there was some wonderful software that required extra hardware. Or the old software had a few bugs in it, and the new version had some lovely features instead. An upgrade was equally a concept which struck horror to the heart of all in the IT department, who knew from bitter experience that nothing worked as well after the so-called improvement. It did, however, keep IT staff in work, ferreting out the bugs and explaining to users why they had lost two days' work because of a slight incompatibility between the old system and the new. That was in the old days. In the 1990s, computing is a populist occupation, and everybody has their own favourite tools. They know what they like, and oddly enough, it happens to be what they know. You might need more capacity to run beefier software, or to go from a single-user to a networked version of your product, but the problems in upgrading are no longer to do with the hardware, nor software. It's in convincing people that there is anything in it for them. The IT department has a new challenge: keeping track of who is using what, and trying to move everyone on to the same version of the same software. The acronym 'Wysiwyg' appeared in the 1980s to sum up the new guise of computing: What You See Is What You Get. No-one, however, came up with a sobriquet to sum up the conundrum with which generations of developers and users have wrestled. The closest contender is 'Whynger' - When You Never Get Exact Requirements, (an acronym devised by the judging panel of CA's Business Software Challenge). The need for upgrades, new releases, new improved versions, is driven by the fact that users never know exactly what they want until they've got it, and then it's never quite right. You have to suffer to be upgraded - 'I upgraded to DOS 6, hit a double-space and lost all my data,' laments Barry Denton, who as director of client services for Barclays Computer Operations, is responsible for tens of thousands of end-users of Barclays Bank computer systems. Denton believes that the real problem posed by upgrading is testing. 'Clients now have such variety of software and hardware that exhaustive testing is impossible, and even the smallest change can cause problems that ricochet. The suppliers always presume that people want to upgrade, but more than two-thirds of the users want to 'stay put' because there is always a light element of suspicion that there'll be problems.' These days suppliers want to move you on, because it's expensive to support multiple versions of a product. The over-the-counter PC software market actually relies on 'add-on sales' for revenue, (rather than annual licensing as in larger systems) and has a vested interest in moving users on to the next version. 'FREE' UPGRADES In early days, operating systems (OSs) were proprietary. This meant a certain change of operating system when moving from one computer to another. This was the case even when sticking with the same supplier, such as ICL or IBM, and moving up the mainframe range. Software was licensed (still is, in many products with a mainframe heritage) and upgrades 'free' within the annual fee. Digital Equipment, the first company to propose a real alternative to the mainframe with its famed PDP 11 range, seized on and perfected the idea of having an 'upgradeable' operating system. DEC's VMS allowed users to start small and progress up through hardware upgrades without any software changes. Other mid-range suppliers followed by adopting the now standard Unix operating system. This 'openness' makes hardware upgrades easier within such a 'platform.' IBM put the same lesson into practice with its 'upgradeable' mid-range AS400 computer. Hardware homogeneity makes upgrades much easier for software developers to provide. The personal computer software industry was quick to exploit the potential of a platform that everybody shared. The PC explosion started with CP/M, the universal eight-bit microprocessor OS. When IBM picked Microsoft's MS-DOS for its PC, it provided the foundations of today's PC software industry and Microsoft's own greatness. Concepts such as interoperability, portability, connectivity, have become a reality, taking the fear out of changing environments. But what users really want is to stay cosy, with what they know, (such as Lotus or Excel spreadsheets) sacrificing nothing, but at the same time having access to the smorgasbord of goodies available through the mainframe. Alongside 'standard' operating systems, client-server systems allow users power on the desktop, with the flexibility of hooking into databases elsewhere when necessary. For example, Lotus Notes users can access 'enterprise-wide data' from mainframe and mid-range databases. Trinzic's InfoHub provides access to 'legacy' databases for PC users. In recognition of the innate conservatism of users, software development tools have appeared to move users ever onward and upward. Ian McPhee, president of Watcom, talks about 'scaleability' and 'shrink-wrapped client-server' when explaining Watcom's Powerbuilder desktop version - 'the whole thrust is to upgrade people's skills, to move them out of the PC database environment,' he says. Flexibility is wonderful for users, but difficult to support. Devolving power to the users often means ending up with a mess of incompatible systems, not as 'open' as people had hoped, and very expensive to maintain. Keeping hardware and software in step is a skill of its own. Many companies with their origins in proprietary hardware manufacture (Olivetti, Unisys, Siemens Nixdorf, to name but three) fervently embraced Unix and the Open Systems principle. They discovered that, where most things were equal in hardware terms, their services had to be distinguished by 'added value' - consultancy and services. They have become single source suppliers, a one-stop-shop selling, implementing and subsequently supporting complete solutions, also taking on board all the hassles of upgrades. Olivetti's Customer Support Group's Supportnet service includes a 'software audit' that determines who is using what, and provides advice on how to upgrade by staying in step with new versions. Lee Francis, general manager of the Siemens Nixdorf PC business unit, suggests leasing, and pursuing a forward-looking purchasing strategy - 'by choosing the right IT partner, an IT specialist that can provide total PC solutions, including support, training, and finance, organisations can enjoy the most up to date PC platform,' he says. Even Legent, the supplier of mainframe performance software, is making a move into supporting client server. 'The thing people do least well is to manage the three aspects of performance, capacity and finance in an integrated way,' says Legent marketing director Steve Hughes. 'The move to distributed software brings that home. There are new tricks for users to learn in systems management: we have 25 years experience.' Oracle's Jocelyn Hartland-Swann, vice president of business process re-engineering, sums up 'the people aspect' of upgrading in four words - 'All change is loss,' he says. 'But providing information to people does help to redress the balance, reminding them of the unpleasantness that is being removed, and the good things to come.'</p>

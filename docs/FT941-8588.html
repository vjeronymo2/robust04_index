			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil price steadies after touching five-year low The oil price oscillated sharply yesterday after hitting a new five-year low of Dollars 12.92 late on Wednesday in New York. At London's International Petroleum Exchange the April Brent crude contract began trading at Dollars 12.96 a barrel, a new low for the IPE, though it recovered to Dollars 13.20 in late afternoon. On the European physical market Brent crude for April delivery also dipped below the Dollars 13 mark before recovering to Dollars 13.36 a barrel in early evening, up 5 cents on the day. The new low represented, in real terms, the lowest price that oil had reached since the first oil shock of 1973, according to analysts. Traders said there were no particular developments to account for the latest bout of volatility. The markets still showed underlying weakness because of the failure of the recent spell of exceptionally cold weather in the US to drive the price up. However trading volumes were thin because of the absence of many traders at this week's London meeting of the Petroleum Institute. Mr Jeremy Hudson at Lehman Brothers said he believed the market could still test a Dollars 12.50 low, though he expected the price to head back over Dollars 15 later in the year because supplies might be constrained. Mr Paul Gignoux of Smith Barney said that additional factors behind the recent weakness were the conspicuous economic problems of certain members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, notably Iran and Venezuela, which meant that it would be hard for producers to curb output. An Opec official was quoted in London as saying that while the price fall was alarming, the organisation had no plans to advance its next planned ministerial meeting on March 25. It was the failure of Opec ministers to come up with a convincing production plan at their last meeting in November that began the latest slide. Some Opec ministers repeated their calls yesterday for action by non-Opec producers, particularly those operating in the North Sea, to curb their production.</p>

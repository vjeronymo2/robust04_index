			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (21): When family money needs protection - Trusts Why do people set up trusts? The reasons are as varied as people, but the three most common reasons are: To ensure that the family wealth continues to be properly managed after the individual's death: The people to whom you may wish to leave your wealth may not be best able to manage it. They may be financially immature, financially illiterate - or you just don't trust them to leave enough for the next generation. A trust set up by your will, to take effect on your death, can appoint people in whom you have confidence as your trustees to manage your money after your death, and preserve your wealth for the benefit of those whom you wish to inherit your money. To ensure that the family wealth does not find its way into the wrong hands: It is not uncommon for a family to include children from previous marriages. If you die and leave your wealth to your spouse, unless you leave it in trust you cannot be sure that she will leave your money for your children. Even if you do not have children from previous marriages, if you die young your wife may have further children from subsequent marriages whom you may not wish to benefit. Again, you may be tempted to set up a trust in your will, to ensure that your wealth is directed where you want it to go. A will is not the only time when people make a trust to ensure that the family wealth does not find its way into the wrong hands. Parents sometimes wish to provide for their children before their death, but do not wish to give them the money outright. They may not want their children to have too much money too soon. A trust is a good way of putting restrictions on the wealth you wish to give to your children. For tax reasons: Even though you and your spouse are the trustees of a trust, and the trust money is in your name, the trust fund will not be taxed as your money. It is taxed as the trust's money. The rate at which the trust money is taxed depends on the type of trust and the relationship between you (the settlor) and the beneficiaries. As a rule of thumb, if you wish to be a beneficiary of your own trust (and you do not fall within the special class of non UK domiciliaries) the trust has no tax advantages whatsoever. For this reason, tax planning is only for the rich - that is, for those who can afford to give it away. Assuming you are within this category, tax mitigation is possible, through the use of trusts for all the three main direct taxes - that is, income tax, capital gains tax and inheritance tax. For example, a trust set up for your children can pay CGT at a rate of 25 per cent, rather than your rate of 40 per cent. Further, if you live seven years after funding the trust, no inheritance tax is payable on the trust assets on your death. A trust for your children is not, however, very effective in mitigating income tax while your children are under the age of 18. This is not true of trusts set up for grandchildren, in which case income tax can be saved as well as capital gains tax and inheritance tax. It should be mentioned, however, that the advantageous position of trusts in estate planning may not continue if we have a change of government. Therefore, if you can afford to set up trusts for your children or grandchildren and have not done so, it may be wise to do so while the tax legislation remains favourable.

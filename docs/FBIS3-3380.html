The meeting first approved a report delivered by NPC Law  Committee Chairman Xue Ju on the examination result of a draft  Budget Law.

The meeting  adopted his suggestion.    The Presidium meeting also approved to submit to the current  NPC session for examination a draft decision on empowering the  Xiamen City People's Congress and its standing committee with  the power to formulate laws and regulations for implementation  in the Xiamen Special Economic Zone.    The Presidium approved a draft resolution on the work report  of the NPC Standing Committee and decided to distribute the  resolution to all NPC delegations for examination and then put  it to a vote at a full meeting of the session.    Today's Presidium meeting also approved a draft resolution  on  the work reports of the Supreme People's Courts and Supreme  People's Procuratorate and decided to put the draft resolution  to a vote at a full meeting of the current session.

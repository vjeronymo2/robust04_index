			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee price surge brings return of Indian export curb The Indian government, unwilling to pay the electoral price of surging coffee prices, has drawn back from its policy of liberalising marketing of the commodity. With assembly elections coming in November in the states of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, the federal government has decided to limit coffee exports to 110,000 tonnes this year in an effort to curb prices. In the final four months it will issue permits for only 5,000 tonnes a month. Restricting coffee exports was not an easy step for the government to take two years into its market liberalisation programme. Faced, however, with severe opposition criticism over the 'action taken' on the joint parliamentary committee report on the securities scandal the government could not ignore the anger of the coffee consumers in the south of India, who are paying as much as Rs200 (Pounds 4.10) for 1kg of coffee powder, up from Rs60 a year ago. According to the growers, the restriction on exports will create problems for exporters, who may not be able to fulfil all their contractual obligations. The move may not, however, provide much relief to domestic consumers as the 1993-94 (October-September) crop is now expected to be only 170,000 tonnes, instead of the 208,000 tonnes the Coffee Board had forecast earlier. Moreover, local traders are said to have hoarded some coffee. The growers are dismayed that the government has not as yet accepted their offer of 5,000 tonnes for distribution through 'fair price' shops at subsidised rates. Though coffee is not covered by the Indian Essential Commodities Act and it is not perceived as a poor man's beverage, the government is likely to arrange its distribution through 'fair price' shops well before the state elections are held. Although the imposition of a levy on exports is ruled out growers and exporters see the cap on export as a 'retrograde move'. But the growers are happy that the Coffee Board has recommended that they be allowed to market their entire production directly . They are now required to surrender 50 per cent to the board, which conducts weekly auctions. In the current year, however, the board has received less than 25 per cent of the crop, causing it much embarrassment.</p>

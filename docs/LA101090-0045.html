			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DODGER APOLOGIZES TO S.D. BUSINESSMEN;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: BUT THE TWO WHO WERE THROWN OUT OF A GAME BECAUSE OF AN ALLEGED  RACIAL SLUR WANT AN APOLOGY FROM THE PADRES OR THEY MAY SEEK LEGAL ACTION.  </P> <P> A local businessman, ejected from a San Diego Padres' game after a  controversial incident in June, said Tuesday that he has received a written  apology from the Los Angeles Dodgers' outfielder who initially accused him of  making a racial slur.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Michael Alessio, who, with fellow businessman Phil Palisoul, was  ejected from San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium after Dodgers' Manager Tom Lasorda  complained to security guards, said the matter is far from closed.  </P> <P> Alessio said he may still take legal action against the Padres for their  handling of the incident, which he said left him publicly humiliated.  </P> <P> "I still have my legal options, which include a possible suit against the  Padres," he said. "However, I won't be suing Hubie Brooks (the Dodgers'  outfielder involved in the controversy). He was very nice in that apology."  </P> <P> Alessio, as well as his attorney, Lionel P. (Chip) Hernholm, said they won't be  satisfied until the Padres issue a public apology.  </P> <P> Padres' President Dick Freeman said Tuesday that he was "sorry the incident  occurred," but beyond that, declined comment. Freeman said he had written a  letter to Alessio outlining his position, which Hernholm called unacceptable.  </P> <P> The incident in question occurred in the eighth inning of a 2-1 Padres' victory  on June 10. Brooks told Lasorda and a security guard on duty in the Dodgers'  dugout that among the derisive taunts yelled at him throughout the game was a  racial slur -- which Alessio and Palisoul have heatedly denied.  </P> <P> Shortly after Brooks and Lasorda yelled back an angry retort, Alessio said that  he and Palisoul were taken to a "cage" beneath the stadium. One cage was  labeled "ejection," Alessio said, and the other "detox."  </P> <P> He said they were escorted by guards for the Chula Vista firm of Pro-Tect  Professional Services, which handles security for the Padres.  </P> <P> "They kept us in there about five minutes," Palisoul said, "and then escorted  us out of the stadium. He (the security guard) said if we came back in we would  be in violation of municipal law. So, we waited outside . . . for our boys."  </P> <P> Alessio said the most embarrassing aspect of the incident to both him and  Palisoul was having been separated from their 11- and 12-year-old sons, who  remained in the stands with a friend -- attorney Hernholm -- until the game was  over.  </P> <P> Palisoul said the boys play on Little League teams, and throughout the game,  they and their fathers were surprised by the crude language and gestures  exhibited by the Dodgers.  </P> <P> "All during the game, we engaged in what I would call harmless chiding or  heckling of the players," Palisoul said. "But it was not obscene or anything.  You know, it was just stuff you would do to the opposing team. There was  nothing that you could even remotely construe as a racial slur. That was the  furthest thing from anything that was said.  </P> <P> "The final thing that caused the blowup -- that caused Lasorda to blow up --  was that, after Brooks popped up (in the 8th inning), I said, 'Nice hit,  Hubie,' and then he said something to me. Well, then, Lasorda jumped out and  started screaming at me, and it was very profane stuff.  </P> <P> "I said, 'Geez, you're a little tense, aren't you?,' and then he got the guard  and came out and pointed at me and Mike Alessio. But racial slur? That was  patently untrue."  </P> <P> City Councilman Ron Roberts, who was sitting with Alessio and Palisoul behind  the Dodgers' dugout when the incident occurred, said afterward: "Those men did  absolutely nothing wrong, and I say that without qualification."  </P> <P> Roberts said that "nothing even remotely resembling a racial slur" was said to  Brooks, who, three days later in an interview with The Times, stopped short of  saying that he had been the object of a racist remark.  </P> <P> "The guy (Palisoul) was saying a whole bunch of stuff," Brooks said at the  time. "He was hassling everybody the whole game. I may have heard a racial slur  in there, but it was a lot of other things. He was getting on everybody. I just  wanted him to stop bothering me."  </P> <P> "Hubie said this guy was getting on him, so I just told the guard to tell this  guy to stop bothering my player," Lasorda said at the time. "All I did was ask  the guard to tell him to lay off my guy."  </P> <P> But in his letter, copies of which were made available Tuesday, Brooks said  that he "cannot conclusively state" that he "either observed or heard" Alessio  or anyone in his party "make comments of a racially disparaging or 'racial slur  type' nature."  </P> <P> "Please be advised that I apologize for any embarrassment or inconvenience  either of you may have incurred by reason of the unfortunate incident . . . ,"  the letter reads. "I regret and apologize for the fact that as a result of my  accusations against you and those in your party, the two of you were ejected  from the . . . game. I regret any emotional injury or injury to reputation and  good standing sustained by either of you as a result of this incident."  </P> <P> Attorney Hernholm said the most striking aspect of the story to him was the  "quickness and sensitivity" with which the Dodgers' management responded to his  complaint, as opposed to the Padres' "overwhelming lack of concern and  consideration for Mr. Alessio as a fan."  </P> <P> Hernholm said he was contacted by the Dodgers' in-house attorney, who  "explored" the matter with Brooks' agent and attorney, the outcome being the  written apology.  </P> <P> "They said that Mr. Brooks was fully prepared to sign any retraction, any  apology, and above all, did not want the matter to go to trial," Hernholm said.  "Whereas, the Padres' response, or non-response, was exaggerated or further  demonstrated by the quick response made by the Dodgers. The Dodgers jumped  right on it, but the Padres have done nothing more than issue self-serving  statements that don't come close to matching an apology."  </P> <P> Hernholm said that it was "even more unusual" that a "prominent citizen" such  as Alessio, a GOP contributor and delegate to the 1988 Republican Convention,  "would be treated in such a shoddy and disrespectful manner."  </P> <P> Hernholm said that Alessio owns Padres' season tickets, behind the visiting  team's dugout, as well as a stadium sky box, which he uses for both baseball  and football games.  </P> <P> Hernholm said the Padres' recent change in ownership had not made a difference  in Alessio's case, since the Tom Werner group that bought the franchise from  Joan Kroc had investigated the incident "as a board matter" and decided that no  apology was necessary.  </P> <P> Hernholm said Dick Freeman's position is "that we're not going to get an  apology or any admission that anything done was wrong. They said they were  willing to tell Mike they were sorry the incident happened -- which they have  done -- and to invite him to lunch, but other than that, nothing. It's  ridiculous, and it isn't over."  </P></p>

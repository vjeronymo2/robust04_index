			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Weakened pound keeps Walker from bankruptcy THE falling pound has saved Mr George Walker from bankruptcy. The former chairman of the leisure group Brent Walker yesterday narrowly won the approval of his creditors for an alternative plan to repay a small amount of the Pounds 180m he owes. His escape was achieved because UK insolvency procedures in effect allow creditors one vote for each pound they are owed. Mr Walker won because some of his debts were in foreign currency, which translated into more pounds after sterling's recent devaluation. At a meeting in London yesterday, creditors representing Pounds 136m of the Pounds 180m total debt - just over the 75 per cent required - voted in favour of his alternative to the bankruptcy petition filed by TSB Bank. The vote had been postponed two weeks ago. Some Pounds 30m of the vote in favour was held in foreign currency by offshore trusts associated with Mr Walker and his family. The sterling value of the debt held by these trusts has increased by roughly Pounds 4m since the pound began its slide. Creditors who voted against his voluntary arrangement have one month to appeal. Some appeared to be unhappy yesterday that claims by trusts associated with the Walker family had been allowed to vote. Mr Walker has agreed to give creditors half his after-tax income for the next three years, his 1.5m shares in Brent Walker, his stakes in two private companies, two properties and a one-sixth share of an apartment in Switzerland. He has also pledged any proceeds of a legal claim in France and from his action against Brent Walker for unfair dismissal. Mr Michael Coleman, of Harkavy's, Mr Walker's solicitors, said he expected creditors would receive about Pounds 15m under the arrangement.</p>

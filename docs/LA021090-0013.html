			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ETHNIC CONFLICT IN EAST BLOC  </P> <P> I disagree with the observation by McManus. McManus states that nationalism is  dangerous. On the contrary, I feel it is the healthiest omen experienced by not  only the East Bloc countries but specifically the Soviet Republic.  </P> <P> Nationalism has always existed there in spite of the Russians' insistence on  developing the robotic "Soviet Man" -- devoid of a heritage, history, culture,  etc. This plot did not work as we can see. The underlying nationalism is being  recognized.  </P> <P> I spent the last 1 1/2 years in the Soviet Union's non-Russian republics and  what I saw and heard was truly positive. The people are full of hope -- maybe  for the first time in 70 years. All their energies are being applied to  throwing off the Russians once and for all -- and these were not the Baltic  republics either.  </P> <P> ERIC McHUGH  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

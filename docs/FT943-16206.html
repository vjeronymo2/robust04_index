			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Beijing to put restrictions onfilm imports China yesterday said it would impose new censorship rules on imported films, signalling a chill in official attitudes through media reports that imports would be limited to 30 per cent of the total film market and co-production deals would be curtailed. The official China Daily quoted Mr Li Wenbin, an official of the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television, as saying that foreign films would be subjected to 'more careful screening.' Mr Li insisted the restrictions were not aimed at excluding 'foreign culture.' Rather the intention was to 'protect and develop the national movie industry.' Mr Li added that the restrictions were not aimed at shutting out foreigners. 'Co-production of films with foreigners can survive (the new rules) if the principle of mutual benefits is observed,' he was reported as saying. But over the past year, the Chinese authorities have exhibited increasing sensitivity to films that have reflected negatively on the role of the Communist Party. The acclaimed 'Farewell My Concubine' was heavily censored because it cast the party in a poor light. A co-production deal involving the filming of the Cultural Revolution epic 'Life and Death in Shanghai' has also been put on hold, apparently because of worries about negative official reaction. The proposed new censorship rules coincide with general tightening up by China's leaders, including campaigns against official corruption and dissident publications. The China Daily report did not reveal when the new regulations would come into effect. China has also this year sought to curb reception of satellite-broadcast films by banning satellite dishes without a permit. However, attempts to curtail the spread of dishes appears to have been only partially successful. China's film industry which, for many years, was heavily protected from foreign competition, has recently been obliged to compete with imports, particularly those from Hong Kong, which are popular in southern regions. According to the new rules, co-production deals - the main avenue for foreign film makers operating in China - will be limited to 30 annually and 'at least three of them must be based on real life.' 'Film co-production will be well received so long as they are of fine artistic taste and sell well,' said Mr Li. The Chinese official said the draft rules also repudiated the practice of labelling films 'unsuitable for children.'</p>

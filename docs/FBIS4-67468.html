			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Paul Stokes: "First Marine Protector for </F> Coastline Under Threat"]    [Text] A Scotsman has been recruited as Britain's first  marine conservation officer, responsible for protecting the  threatened coastline of Wales.    Simon Reddy, 27, an ecologist, will work to save threatened  birds, fish and animals along one of Britain's wildest and most  beautiful shorelines.    Environmentalists say the quantity and range of sea life in  the region makes it one of the most important marine habitats in  Europe.    Mr Reddy's area of responsibility includes the whole of  Cardigan Bay, home to a family of about 100 bottle-nosed  dolphins and one of only two permanent locations the sea mammal  populates in the Europe's northern waters.    Killer whales can frequently be seen basking in the bay on  their way to and from their breeding grounds.    Naturalists also have evidence that larger whales are  arriving in the area, with one confirmed sighting of a fin whale  which can grow to 80 ft long and weigh up to 80 tons.    Other breeds of dolphin and porpoise also use the bay as  well  as the occasional pilot whale and basking shark. Seals are a  common sight around the rocky shores of the mainland and islands  where the bird life includes puffins, gannets, guillemots and  razor-bills.    The sheltered nature of the Cardigan and Carmarthen bays  means wildlife is threatened by pollution. Only three beaches  along the whole of the Welsh coast -- at Cefn Sidan, near  Llanelli, Whitesands, at St Davids, and the North Beach in  Tenby, Dyfed -- carry European "blue flag" status for  cleanliness.    The environment is also under threat from noise pollution  from jet skis and boats.    According to the Dyfed Wildlife Trust many of the wild  dolphins they have photographed have scars caused by the  propellors of speeding boats they try to race.    Mr Reddy, who was educated at Aberdeen University and has  worked for Greenpeace on its campaign ship, Solo, said: "It is a  wonderful stretch of coastline but it is obviously in need of  our help to address the various problems it now faces."    His work is aimed at helping the long-term objective of  having the coastal waters designated a Marine Protected Area.    His appointment and associated work is initially funded for  two years through &pound;50,000 raised by the Dyfed Wildlife  Trust  and the same amount of EC grant money. It is hoped the post will  become permanent.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to potential health effects, the Agency may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider other factors as appropriate in deciding whether it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be in the public interest to grant a waiver. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular, the Agency may consider whether a waiver would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with the objectives of the Clean Air Act. In each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instance, the factors considered and relied upon should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clearly identified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Analysis of Emissions Data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Description of Previous Test Programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In support of its request, Ethyl conducted an extensive test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program to determine the effect of MMT on the ability of vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to comply with current and future emission standards. It also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered the impact of MMT on nonregulated vehicle emissions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> urban smog or ozone, refinery emissions, and crude oil use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ethyl claimed that its test results established that MMT would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not cause or contribute to exceedences of current or future  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission standards. It also claimed that MMT use would result in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other benefits consistent with Clean Air Act goals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1988, Ethyl assembled a test fleet of 48 light-duty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles, composed of eight different model types (six Buick  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Centurys (2.5 liter), six Buick Centurys (2.8 liter), six Buick  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Centurys (3.8 liter), six Chevrolet Cavaliers (2.0 liter), six  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ford Escorts (1.9 liter), six Ford Tauruses (3.0 liter), six Ford  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Crown Victorias (5.0 liter) and six Dodge Dynastys (3.0 liter))  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that together represented a broad spectrum of then current (1988)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technology vehicles. To accumulate mileage, Ethyl utilized the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Alternative Mileage Accumulation Cycle'' (AMA) which is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard procedure utilized to accumulate mileage for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification purposes. <FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>  It utilized two laboratories to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measure each vehicle's exhaust emissions of the regulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pollutants (HC, oxides of nitrogen (NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and carbon monoxide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (CO)) at 5,000-mile intervals up to 75,000 miles in the case of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> most vehicles and up to 100,000 miles in the case of several. <FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It also tested a number of these vehicles for evaporative HC,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particulate and manganese emissions, materials compatibility,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> driveability and catalyst durability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 24 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A driving cycle is a description of how to drive a vehicle to accumulate mileage, including such things as a what percentage of driving should be done at what speed and what the overall average speed should be. The AMA cycle is described in EPA Mobile Source Advisory Circular 37&hyph;A, (See Docket A&hyph;91&hyph;46) and is essentially prescribed for use by manufacturers to accumulate mileage for certification of vehicles (See 40 CFR 86.092&hyph;26). A driving cycle is used so that test vehicles accumulate mileage in a manner that is supposedly representative of in-use vehicles. The emissions of a test vehicle that has accumulated mileage according to a driving cycle representative of in-use vehicles are more likely to be representative of in-use vehicles' emissions. There are actually three alternative cycles associated with the AMA; however, the average speeds of the three alternatives are very similar, ranging from 29.9 mph to 30.72 mph. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 25 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The ``useful life'' of model year 1993 and earlier light-duty vehicles (LDV's) is 50,000 miles or five years, whichever occurs first (section 202(d)). However, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 extended the useful life of LDV's to 100,000 miles or ten years, beginning with 1994 model year vehicles. For the standards that begin to take effect in model year 1994, section 207(c) provides for intermediate in-use standards for several years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SALES TAX HIKE OKD FOR NOVEMBER VOTE;  </P> <P> TRANSIT: NEW JOINT GOVERNMENT BOARD APPROVES THE BALLOT MEASURE. IT WOULD ADD  HALF A CENT TO HELP FUND THE COUNTY'S RAIL SYSTEM AND OTHER TRANSPORTATION.  </P> <P> A sales tax increase measure to generate $400 million per year to help keep Los  Angeles County's proposed 150-mile rail system and other transit programs on  track was placed on the November ballot Wednesday by local elected officials  gathered at a historic transportation session.  </P> <P> If approved, the measure would raise the current 6 1/2% sales tax to 7%.  Consumers would pay more than $400 million annually in added taxes to build and  operate the new rail system, maintain bus service and make street improvements.  </P> <P> Mayor Tom Bradley, who is pushing the measure, said it will ensure that the  money-short, $5-billion rail construction program will reach the suburban  neighborhoods of Pasadena, the San Fernando Valley and the South Bay. "There is  not enough money. This is the only way we can build" the entire system, Bradley  said.  </P> <P> The action came at a meeting in which Bradley, the five county supervisors and  other elected officials sat for the first time as the joint governing board of  two large, often warring transportation agencies -- the Southern California  Rapid Transit District and the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission.  </P> <P> The session, required by a new state law, was the first step toward ending the  running bureaucratic turf battles between the agencies that critics charge have  hurt the region's ability to deal with growing traffic congestion problems. The  state law, authored by Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Panorama City) requires the  prominent political leaders to meet four times a year as a joint transportation  board and move gradually toward consolidating the agencies.  </P> <P> As the meeting opened, Katz urged the officials to "put the finger-pointing and  sparring behind us and provide Los Angeles with a 21st-Century transportation  system."  </P> <P> Before Katz was out the door, however, the old rivalry erupted in full flower.  The two sides squabbled over misdirected agendas and procedures for conducting  the meetings. Then Supervisor Michael Antonovich, an RTD critic, unsuccessfully  tried to oust RTD General Manager Alan Pegg and put Transportation Commission  chief Neil Peterson in charge of both agencies.  </P> <P> "I can't control the personalities," groaned Katz as he departed.  </P> <P> The sales tax increase measure would be in addition to the more than $400  million in sales taxes already paid by county consumers under a half-cent levy  for transit approved in 1980.  </P> <P> The tax hike reflects the growing costs of both building and operating the  county's new rail system, the first leg of which opened last month between Long  Beach and Los Angeles. The construction program currently is $300 million short  of its needs for the next 10 years.  </P> <P> In fact, the current $24 million annual operating cost of the new Long Beach  Blue Line is being funded temporarily from construction accounts,  transportation officials said.  </P> <P> The sales tax measure squeaked onto the ballot by a 6-5 vote. The leading  opponent of the measure, Supervisor Pete Schabarum, provided the swing vote.  Schabarum, who will author the argument against the measure, said he hopes the  transit tax fails and helps drag down several other proposed tax hikes.  </P> <P> "(I'm) trying to present a menu of tax increases so substantial that they are  rejected in their entirety," he said.  </P> <P> Besides the transit tax, county voters in November will be faced with another  sales tax increase for jail construction, a state sales tax increase for  anti-crime programs and a county property tax increase to fund new recreation  and cultural facilities.  </P> <P> The transit measure and the county-sponsored jail construction measure will be  competing for the last half-cent of local sales tax permitted under current  state law.  </P> <P> As a compromise, the commission agreed to seek new state legislation that would  allow the jail and transit systems to split the sales tax revenue if both are  approved.  </P></p>

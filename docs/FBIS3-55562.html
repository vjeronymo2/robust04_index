"We are working on all these cases in close contact with  head  of the president's office Sergey Filatov," Stepashin added.  Some people who established contacts with foreign intelligence  officers, have been released from their posts.    According to Stepashin, 20 people were arrested on espionage  charges in 1993. Several dozen more espionage cases are still  under investigation.    Stepashin specially stressed that, apart from countries  outside the former Soviet Union, the Baltics and countries of  the Commonwealth of Independent States with which Russia has an  understanding on refraining from intelligence operations against  one another, are actively engaged in intelligence work against  Russia.    The deputy director confirmed that Russian security officers  arrested last summer five Georgian spies fulfilling intelligence  tasks. An Estonian intelligence agent was detained in the Pskov  region. Apart from all else, he committed a grave criminal  offence -- a murder.</p>

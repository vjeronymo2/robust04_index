			<p>BFN     [Text] A responsible source at the Ministry of Defense has  stated the following: In the name of God, the merciful, the  compassionate. If God helps you, none can overcome you.  [Koranic verse] With God's support and with the courage of the  heroes of the valiant Armed Forces, their heroic capabilities,  and high combat skills, the forces protecting Yemeni unity and  championing constitutional legitimacy completely destroyed all  fortifications in the al-'Anad military base yesterday evening.  This morning, these forces were able to fully control the base  after the expiry of the time given to the personnel who were  misled by the secessionist and rebellious gang in the [Yemeni]  Socialist Party [YSP] to allow them to join the forces of  legitimacy. At dawn today, Tuesday, our valiant Armed Forces  ended the military legend that used to surround the al-'Anad  base, its fortifications, and the various weaponry it had stored  in its base and secret cellars. A large part of it was turned  into rubble. Scattered concrete piles, destroyed weapons and  vehicles, and remnants of ash tell the story of the crazy  arrogance of the gang of rebellion, apostasy, and secession in  the YSP. With this military arsenal and other military  ammunition, this gang thought it could be above the people's  will and be greater than their constitutional institutions.    But God Almighty, the people, and the Armed Forces were  lying  in wait for all of this. Thus, their plans were foiled and the  rebels received their punishment.    In addition, our Armed Forces managed to seize what was left  of the variety of military hardware. Units of our brave Armed  Forces are now finishing their missions, after the Yemeni  homeland has irrevocably passed the danger of the threat posed  by the rebellious secessionists to unity and democracy.    Praise be to God who has supported the fighters with his  victory. God is the best to protect and the best to help.  [Koranic verse]    Issued by the Defense Ministry, Sanaa</p>

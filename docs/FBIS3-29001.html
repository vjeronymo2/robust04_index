The news conference was presided over by Deputy Foreign  Minister Le Mai and was attended by a large number of local and  foreign news reporters. The news conference started with the  deputy foreign minister reading the Foreign Ministry statement  on the U.S. presidential decision to lift the embargo against  Vietnam. The statement reads in full as follows:    On behalf of the Foreign Ministry, I would like to  announce the statement of the SRV Foreign Ministry regarding the  U.S. presidential decision to lift the embargo against  Vietnam. [passage omitted on Le Mai reading the Foreign  Ministry statement published above]    This is followed by a question and answer session.    An Australian Radio and Television Company reporter asked:  When did the Vietnamese Government receive the report on the  U.S. presidential decision to lift the embargo and by what  means? And was this decision made by President Bill Clinton or  the U.S. Government?    Deputy Prime Minister Le Mai answered: According to  U.S. law, the right to lift the embargo rests with the  president. As for when we were informed of this, I can say that  we have been widely informed by friends from various countries  and through different means. I am using the word friends here  to refer to newsmen. And before President Clinton's decision  was announced, our [UN] ambassador in New York had met with U.S.  State Department officials who had informed him of the action.  He telephoned me about this matter before 0500 this morning,  that is, before the presidential announcement.    A Japanese ASAHI reporter asked about the plan to establish  the U.S. liaison office in Hanoi and about when the  establishment of diplomatic offices will be planned.    Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai said: The U.S. and  Vietnamese Governments will have a meeting to exchange views on  stipulations governing the number of diplomatic cadres and  members of the diplomatic corps as well as on the operating  procedures for these liaison offices. I do not think that these  are difficult issues. Therefore, the exchange of liaison offices  between the two governments will be undertaken soon.    A BANGKOK POST reporter asked: What are the follow-up steps  after the U.S. presidential announcement on lifting the embargo  against Vietnam and what are the most important issues?    Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai said: What we have been  longing for and will continue to long for is to have the United  States regard Vietnam as a friend. Our Vietnamese people will  also regard the American people as friends.    The deputy foreign minister also answered many questions  raised by Vietnamese and foreign reporters on the MIA issue, on  the question of frozen assets of the two sides, and on the  relations between Vietnam and other ASEAN countries following  the lifting of the embargo.    A FAR EASTERN ECONOMIC REVIEW reporter asked: Rumor has it  that Vietnam will give priority to U.S. businessmen to engage in  a number of investment projects such as those involving oil and  gas exploitation. Is this true?    Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai answered: We welcome  U.S. businessmen coming to do business in Vietnam, to contribute  to economic cooperation, and to spur economic development in  Vietnam in the interests of the two countries. The Vietnamese  Government hereby assures U.S. businessmen that the Vietnamese  Government will create equal opportunities for U.S. businessmen  to compete with those from other countries already in Vietnam.  Tradition does not allow us to give preferential treatment to  one country without giving the same treatment to others. I  think that with its technology and its economic strengths, the  United States will be able to develop its competitive power if  it enjoys equal opportunities.</p>

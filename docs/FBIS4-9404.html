			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Jiri Leschtina: "Where Are the Limits of </F> Vaclav Klaus's Euroskepticism?"]    [Text] Vaclav Klaus's failure to attend the Litomysl  banquet involving seven presidents was yet another caustic  demonstration of the prime minister's skepticism toward  intellectual debates on the subject of European integration.  Every manifestation of skepticism is, in principle, an example  of a discerning point of view, as long as it does not go beyond  a certain limit. Where is the prime minister's limit?    Vaclav Klaus's profound mistrust of any kind of  supranational  institutions, full of bureaucrats who would like to dictate a  new international discipline, is undoubtedly well founded. No  matter what European habits and customs are today and no matter  what European public opinion, which has been evolving for  centuries, is, the road toward a united, supranational Europe  will still be a long one, if we ever reach the end of it.    Critical skepticism in this regard may only be to the  benefit  of the situation. As the Spanish philosopher Ortega y Gasset  pointed out: "I do not recall that any civilization has ever  succumbed to a paroxysm of doubt." And from where else but our  country, endowed with its rich experience of cheap  internationalism, should the most frequent critical and caustic  remarks against the "Brussels visionaries" come?    Even the most pertinent skepticism, however, must steer  clear  of pointless eccentricity. Klaus's Euroskepticism is evidently  inspired by the British mistrust of becoming too bogged down by  European structures, a mistrust whose apostle is Margaret  Thatcher. Her coolness toward any form of international  affiliation, however, is born of the Briton's traditional  insular peevishness and about whom it is claimed, half in jest,  that his often affected inclination toward little animals comes  from what he has put aside from his contacts with other people.    It would be rather absurd, however, if the prime minister of  a small country in Central Europe, where no nation can simply  "dance only to the beat of its own drum," were to endorse a  similar level of isolationism.    It is not just that, in essence, the companionable Bohemians  and Moravians will never be such full-blooded adherents of the  British style of "splendid isolation." The indications that  Klaus's cool attitude toward Brussels and his comments about the  "unfairness" of the NATO air strikes against Serb positions have  aroused unexpected interest from Russia are far more serious.    Some of our government officials have explained away the  recent unanticipated invitation to Vaclav Klaus to make a state  visit to Russia by saying that Moscow would like to find a  kindred spirit in the Czech prime minister as far as its  schizophrenic attitude toward Western Europe is concerned.  There was even a sharp exchange of views at the extraordinary  government session, during which some members of Klaus's Cabinet  somewhat hysterically recommended that the prime minister not go  anywhere. In the end, Klaus himself had to rid Chernomyrdin of  all his false illusions when he declared categorically in Moscow  that politics will not be discussed now because "business" is on  the agenda.    Nevertheless, for us to circumvent the Kremlin's dubious  "attachment" in the future, it would be far better if the prime  minister would limit his natural Euroskepticism, first and  foremost, to criticism of the unrealistic ideas about the  foreseeable unification of Europe. And, as an advocate of  traditional bilateral diplomacy, he should declare clearly that  none other than Kohl's (or, after the elections, Scharping's?)  Germany is our closest partner on our incontrovertible road  toward the European Union.    So far, however, the government has made no attempt to find  a  cure for the understandable German traumas that persist among  our public. Out of an obvious fear of losing popularity, Vaclav  Klaus and other coalition politicians have left the political  field here to the opposition, which is shamelessly playing an  anti-German card.    Today, however, Germany is a scrupulously democratic state  that is an inspiration for us in many things. There is much to  encourage us and much to learn, for example, from the way the  Germans bore, calmly and honorably, the postwar catastrophe and  from how they managed energetically to come to terms with its  terrible aftermath.    For this reason, it would be fitting for Vaclav Klaus to  stand up, with Mrs. Thatcher's courage and sarcasm, not only to  the anonymous bureaucrats in Brussels, but also to the still  burning issue of the Sudeten Germans, which the Bonn government  would also like to sweep definitively from the table.</p>

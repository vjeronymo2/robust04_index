			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Management: When it's all in the name - Tips From The Top / Clive Thompson, chief executive of Rentokil, offers advice on commissioning a new corporate identity I have often said that if I had to choose a company name today I would not choose the name Rentokil. It is doubtful whether anyone in this environmentally aware age would be brave enough to select a company with the name 'Rent to Kill', let alone hope to become the world's largest provider of tropical plants or develop flourishing healthcare and medical services businesses. Indeed one top design company (which we didn't employ) said that a change of name was essential. But there is no doubt that names can be either silly or apparently inappropriate and still remain world famous and popular. Have you ever stopped to think about the food range called 'Birds Eye' or the detergent called 'Fairy Liquid'? There is no doubt that some names achieve that elite status which transcends literal interpretation, and Rentokil in the UK, if not everywhere, has achieved this level. Experts believe it can take up to 30 years, and even after this time only a few companies ever achieve it. So in commissioning a new corporate identity we applied one rule - no name change. In drawing up a brief we first had to be brutally honest in accepting the weaknesses of the existing identity. Two harsh realities emerged: the letters were heavy, awkward and old fashioned - someone rudely likened them to the flared trousers of the 1970s; the reversing out of a red block gave a tabloid newspaper feel and seemed to lack quality. It is amazing how much difference type faces and letter styles can make. We asked the designers to incorporate the fact that we are a company with many different services. Each business was to be represented by a symbol, but however hard you try it is difficult to find good symbols for all of our services. We gave up on this in favour of a modern, friendly, up-beat feel but we just ended up resembling retail-type corporate identities. We decided to explore other ideas. We thought that maybe a change from blood red for Rentokil might be timely, and we considered a variety of different colours. However, we eventually concluded that too much had been invested over many years in Rentokil red and we didn't feel comfortable with any other colours. All this made us realise that we were after evolution not revolution, and we searched for our core values. From this heart searching the words 'modern' and 'quality' emerged, along with a very strong allegiance to the royal warrant. We dropped all the other ideas in favour of these images and the result suddenly began to appear before us. We recognised evolution as the solution and that the strengths of our past had to be continued, but with a fresher, smarter feel. The result was the inclusion of the royal warrant, since we believe it is probably the best recognised symbol of quality in the world, alongside the word Rentokil with crisper, modern letters in an even stronger red. We had originally expressed frustration at the number of occasions when Rentokil was broken into the three words Rent-to-kill, so the designers recommended an underline below the word to encourage the eye to read it as one word. A thinner red stripe than previously was then added on the same white vehicles, with the addition of a black trim at the height of the bumper to give extra visual weight. The result is that the new design has a modern, quality feel which the old design did not; at the same time the new one has enough resemblance to the old logo to be clearly evolved from it. In the end, with 18 months of sometimes hard and frustrating work, the result was almost an anti-climax. We wondered: 'Is it really different enough to reflect all that effort and money?' The answer is a confident 'yes'. We learnt, like many others, that in the end the right answer is the one that feels right for you, and it is amazing how dated our old logo now appears.

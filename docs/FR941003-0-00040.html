			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 8. One comment asked FDA to clarify supplemental patent certifications under proposed &sect;314.50(i)(6)(i). The comment noted that the provision would have applicants submit new patent certifications if a patent were found valid and infringed, but does not instruct applicants what to do if a patent is found to be infringed, but also invalid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA has revised &sect;&sect;314.50(i)(6)(i) and 314.94(a)(12)(vii)(A) to state that an applicant does not have to provide an amended patent certification if a court finds a patent to be invalid and infringed. FDA recognizes that courts have the discretion to focus on patent infringement issues and not decide patent validity. However, court decisions have also recognized the desirability of a court ruling on patent infringement even if the patent is held invalid. (See, e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Medtronic, Inc.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cardiac Pacemakers, Inc <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ., 721 F.2d 1563 at 1583 (Fed. Cir. 1983).) (``Though an invalid claim cannot give rise to liability for infringement, whether it is infringed is an entirely separate question capable of determination without regard to its validity. Because both validity and infringement involve construction of a claim, and because the construction must be the same in determining both, it is desirable to decide both questions at the same time.'') Moreover, in such instances, the Supreme Court has indicated that ``of the two questions, validity has the greater public importance.'' (See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sinclair &amp; Carroll Co.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Interchemical Corp <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ., 325 U.S. 327, 330 (1945).) Consequently, if a court finds a patent to be invalid and infringed, FDA will attach more importance to the finding of invalidity, and will not require an amended patent certification even if the patent is also found to be infringed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. The agency, on its own initiative, has also revised &sect;314.50(i)(6)(ii) regarding patent certifications when a patent is removed from the list of patents for any reason other than a declaration of invalidity. Section 314.50(i)(6)(ii), as proposed, would have required an applicant to certify that there are no patents that claim the drug or, if other relevant patents claim the drug, to submit a request to withdraw the paragraph IV (patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed) certification. FDA has revised this section so that an applicant must certify that there are no patents that claim the drug or, if other relevant patents claim the drug, to provide an appropriate patent certification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. On its own initiative, the agency has also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised &sect;314.50(i)(6)(iii)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) (now renumbered as &sect;314.50(i)(6)(iii)(B)). As proposed, this provision would not require an applicant to amend a patent certification ``when information on an otherwise applicable patent is submitted after the 505(b)(2) application is approved, whether or not the approval of the abbreviated application is effective.'' Because an approval with a delayed effective date is tentative and is not final (see 57 FR 17950 at 17956), the agency has revised &sect;314.50(i)(6)(iii)(B) to require section 505(b)(2) applicants to amend their patent certifications until the effective date of approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. FDA received five comments on proposed &sect;314.50(j) and the applicant's obligations when claiming marketing exclusivity for a product. One comment would change proposed &sect;314.50(j) to have an applicant submit exclusivity information ``with'' its application rather than ``to'' its application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA agrees, in part, with the comment. In general, applicants should submit exclusivity information with their NDA's. If the NDA has been submitted, but has not been approved, the applicant should submit exclusivity information as an amendment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. One comment would revise proposed &sect;314.50(j)(3) to have an applicant state that, ``to the best of its knowledge or belief, a drug has not been approved.'' The comment said proposed &sect;314.50(j)(3) would require applicants to ``prove a negative'' because they would have to show that ``no drug has previously been approved under section 505(b) of the act containing any active moiety in the drug for which the applicant is seeking approval.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA agrees and has amended the rule accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

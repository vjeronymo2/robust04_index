			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Maynayev] </F>   [Text] Bishkek 19 April, TASS -- Russian officers  complained that they are being ousted from the Kyrgyz Army on  the pretext of anti-corruption drive and demanded that Kyrgyz  President Askar Akayev restore order in the Army.    Russian officers of the Oshsk garrison located in the south  of Kyrgyzstan said in an open letter addressed to President  Akayev that recently, departments of the military prosecutor's  office have begun to ouster Russian-speaking commanders from the  Army "contrary to the will of Kyrgyz Defence Minister Myrzakan  Subanov."    "In our opinion, military judicial bodies who have been  looking for thieves stealing military and state property among  Russian officers believe that if we have not gone home yet we  have some sources of income encouraging us to stay. This is  nonsense. We remain here because we swore allegiance here,"  says the letter signed by over 100 Russian officers, which was  published by the "KYRGYZSTAN'S WORD" newspaper today. Russian  commanders put the blame for the situation in the Army on Chief  Military Prosecutor Kubat Kozhonaliyev.    Officers demanded that the president and commander in chief  of the Kyrgyz Army Askar Akayev give guarantees that Russian  officers will be able to perform their duties under normal  conditions.</p>

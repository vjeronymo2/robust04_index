			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Share transfer to save on tax OF ALL the tax information for married couples, I have read none considers a situation where the husband is without income, benefits of any kind, or other emoluments, and who is below pensionable age (62). Would we benefit if my younger working wife, who claims my allowances, transfers her nominal holdings in British Gas and British Telecom to me. We are without issue. If your wife wishes to give you her shareholdings, then you should ensure that the dividends are paid into an account to which she has no access (otherwise the dividends might be deemed still to be her income, under section 674A of the Income &amp; Corporation Taxes Act 1988). Anyone thinking of giving away shares acquired under a privatisation offer should wait until she or he has qualified for the appropriate free shares or other incentives not to change the registration before a specified date. Ask you tax inspector for the free pamphlets IR82 (Independent taxation: a guide for husbands on a low income) and IR112 (How to claim a repayment of income tax). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

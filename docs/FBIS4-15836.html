			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian officials consider that with the apology for  the incident that has arisen from President Boris Yeltsin's  order on the creation of military bases in Latvia, the conflict  has been resolved. However, Latvian officials' views are  different, and Latvia intends to request the alteration of the  text of the presidential order. Immediately after Russia's  explanation the Latvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that,  as Russia has already partly withdrawn Yeltsin's order, it would  be logical to repeal or alter it. This was told to the Baltic  News Service [BNS] by (Peteris Inkelis), first secretary at the  Latvian Embassy in Moscow, today. According to Russian  legislation, the published order will come into force on 13  April, which is obviously not acceptable to Latvia.    According to information at the disposal of BNS, Russia  intends, nevertheless, to draft an altered version of the text  of Yeltsin's order. Though the alteration of the text is  difficult, because neither the head of the Defense Ministry nor  the Foreign Ministry nor Yeltsin himself are in Moscow at the  moment. The Russian president's structures also intend to  ascertain reasons for the error creeping into the presidential  order. Sergey Krasavchenko, deputy head of the Yeltsin  administration, even deems it possible that that was not a mere  technical error, but rather a political act aimed at the  disruption of the meeting between the Russian and Latvian  presidents.</p>

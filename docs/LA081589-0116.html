			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AILING TEXAS S&amp;L CONSIDERS SELLING ITS STAKE IN BUILDER J.M. PETERS INC.  </P> <P> A troubled Texas thrift says it is considering selling its stake in J. M.  Peters Co. Inc. of Newport Beach, one of Southern California's largest home  builders.  </P> <P> A sale has long been expected, as San Jacinto Savings &amp; Loan Assn. of  Houston has been ailing for some time; the thrift reported a loss of $100  million for the fiscal year that ended in June.  </P> <P> San Jacinto said late last week that it had hired the investment banking firm  of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. to evaluate its alternatives with respect to  Peters and to two other subsidiaries, including the sale of those.  </P> <P> San Jacinto is itself a subsidiary of a troubled company, Southmark Corp. of  Dallas. Southmark reported a loss of $1 billion for its third quarter, and it  filed for bankruptcy last month.  </P> <P> Peters says a sale would not interrupt its business, which is building  expensive homes in Southern California.  </P> <P> Peters' stock has been rising the last few weeks on speculation that San  Jacinto would sell its 87% stake in Peters. Stock analysts say the company  could fetch more than $250 million. San Jacinto bought Peters in 1985,  reportedly for $21 million.  </P> <P> Hiring an investment banker to study selling Peters -- one of Southmark's crown  jewels -- is the latest chapter in the saga of Southmark, a once high-flying  real estate investment firm brought low by the crash in Texas real estate.  </P> <P> Southmark raised $10.5 million in 1987 by selling nearly 13% of Peters' stock  -- 1.75 million shares -- to the public. In the last few years, Southmark has  been forced to consider selling as much as $500 million in assets to meet its  debt payments.  </P> <P> San Jacinto tried to sell Peters early last year to another troubled real  estate investor, MDC Holdings Inc. of Denver, for $100 million in notes. That  deal fell through last year at the last minute.  </P> <P> What is likely to happen to Peters? San Jacinto will not say, but stock  analysts posit two plausible scenarios: (1) that the rest of Peters' stock --  about 12 million shares -- may be sold to the public; (2) that San Jacinto may  sell its stake to another company.  </P> <P> Having so little Peters' stock in the public's hands -- about 2 million shares  -- has kept the price down, stock analysts say. The tie to Southmark probably  hurt the stock price, too, they say. With that tie severed, and with more stock  on the market, the price is likely to go up.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Severe Discount'  </P> <P> "There was a severe discount (in the stock's price) because of the small  float," said Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. analyst Barbara Allen.  </P> <P> With a sale to another company, Allen said, a buyer from out of state eager to  break into the hot California market would be most likely, although a foreign  buyer is a possibility too.  </P> <P> In that case, the company might sell for as much as $20 a share, or $280  million, Allen said. She said investors have undervalued Peters stock, now  trading at $13.75 a share on the American Stock Exchange. (The stock closed up  12.5 cents Monday as 17,000 shares changed hands.)  </P> <P> Others aren't quite so sure. Michael Kirby, who follows real estate investment  trusts at Newport Beach's Green Street Advisors Inc., says he thinks home  builders' earnings have peaked and that investors will probably lose interest  in that stock.  </P> <P> "These companies have seen some extremely high earnings, which can't be  sustained," Kirby said. "I'd be surprised if somebody paid a large premium to  buy a company like Peters."  </P> <P> A third possibility is that Jim Peters, who founded the company in 1975, could  buy it. Analysts, however, do not think that scenario is likely because the  company would have to take on a massive debt.  </P> <P> Peters, like San Jacinto, will not say what form a sale is likely to take.  </P> <P> The company expects another strong year after the bedlam of 1988, when whole  sections of subdivisions would sell out moments after going on the market.  Prices went through the roof -- Orange County houses are among the most  expensive in the nation -- and builders' profits surged.  </P> <P> Things are quieter this year, although there is still enough action for Peters  to make substantial money. The company says it has had fewer houses to sell  recently because of the timing of its construction projects.  </P> <P> Peters sold $57.5 million worth of houses during its first quarter ended May  31; the first-quarter figure for last year was $89.6 million. Profits were $5  million for the first quarter and $7.3 million for the period last year. Peters  said the company expects to have a much stronger second quarter, when it will  finish many more new houses.  </P></p>

			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: A sterling shine Sterling's recovery this week is one of those developments which has the markets scrabbling for justification after the event. It may be that much of the gain - the currency briefly hit DM2.50 yesterday - simply reflects short-covering ahead of the year-end. But one cannot ignore the less technical explanations. With the German economy weakening fast and strains within the ERM continuing, there is some prospect of lower interest rates in Europe before too long. In that case, sterling's interest rate disadvantage could be set to dwindle. Narrow money supply growth is accelerating and there is tentative evidence - fuelled yesterday by November's higher new car sales - that the economic situation is not as hopeless as it seemed a month ago. Against that backdrop, the argument for further sharp base rate cuts, perhaps to 5 per cent, is losing force. True, there may be room for another cut in the new year. But whereas the exchange rate no longer restricts monetary policy, domestic constraints are becoming more apparent. This is a mixed blessing for financial markets. Gilts were buoyed yesterday by sterling's strength, but low yields and a currency at the top of its range are hardly a good starting point for funding next year's borrowing requirement. Equities at least have the recovery story to play with. Significantly, though, companies reporting this week - from Bass to Hanson and Royal Bank of Scotland - were cautious on the UK outlook. The recovery thus looks weak and patchy. Equities may not have much headroom left.</p>

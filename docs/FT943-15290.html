			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / International Company News: Australia goldminers seek to simplify link Samantha Gold, the small Western Australian gold-mining company, has made an all-shares offer for Resolute Resources, another junior miner based in Perth. The offer is worth around ADollars 350m (USDollars 255.5m). Samantha is offering two of its own shares for every seven in Resolute. The two companies have been linked since August last year, when Resolute acquired control of Equity in Industry, which in turn held a large minority stake in Samantha, making it the goldminer's largest shareholder. This interest now stands at around 42 per cent of Samantha's equity, and the bidder plans to buy back and eliminate that holding if the merger is successful. It said this simplification of the two groups' structures was a key reason for the deal, although increased focus on gold and possible cost savings were other factors. The merged group would have a forecast annual gold production in excess of 300,000 ounces for fiscal 1995-96.</p>

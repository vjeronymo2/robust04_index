			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Jordan conspiracy verdict due today: Trial could be a warning to militants JORDAN's State Security Court is due to announce its verdict today in the most controversial political trial the country has seen for years. Two militant Moslem members of parliament and two merchants are accused of conspiring to overthrow the Hashemite monarchy with the intent of creating an Islamic state. The MPs, Mr Leith Shbeilat, and Mr Ya'aqub Qarrash, face charges of belonging to an illegal Iranian-backed group - the Shabab al Nafeer al Islami (Moslem Youth for Mobilisation) - possession of weapons and explosives, undermining Jordanian-Iraqi relations and slander against the king. Both men face a maximum sentence, if found guilty, of death. Mr Shbeilat and Mr Qarrash have pleaded not guilty while the two other defendants say they are guilty only of possessing weapons which they insist were for use in the occupied territories against Israel. After a month of controversial and often fiery sittings, the outcome of the trial, the first of its kind to be held in public, is seen by many as a serious test of Jordan's embryonic democracy and, perhaps, of the degree to which the authorities in Jordan may seek to circumscribe its limits. The verdict comes just days after King Hussein, in his first speech since returning to Amman from cancer surgery in the US, laid out his vision of Jordan's future as an exemplary democratic state in the region. From the outset, the case has been riddled with conspiracy theories. Mr Qarrash and Mr Shbeilat claim that the trial has political motivations and the proceedings have been reproached by many as unconstitutional. Many Jordanians have expressed the hope that the King himself, as formal head of the kingdom's judicial system, should somehow intervene in the case. In a recent FT interview, King Hussein said he was 'keeping a close eye on what is happening to see what can be done'. He added: 'I don't think anyone should worry, we are totally committed to democracy, to pluralism, to human rights.' Prosecution evidence collected by the General Intelligence Department (GID), otherwise known as the Mukharbarat, includes bugged telephone conversations and a secret witness, a Mr Yassin Ramadan Yassin, who claimed to have carried Dollars 200,000 from Iran to Mr Shbeilat last April. After questioning Mr Yassin during a closed session of the otherwise open court last month, Mr Shbeilat and Sheikh Qarrash's lawyers withdrew from the case in protest at what they described as 'terrorism of the defence' and the two MPs began a hunger strike. The court-appointed lawyers who presented the defence's summation were rejected by both MPs as 'not understanding the case'. Although Mr Qarrash and Mr Shbeilat are friends who share not only religious convictions but also an office in Amman, they are, in the eyes of the Jordanian public, as different as chalk and cheese. Mr Qarrash is known for his religious zeal and controversial business practices and, aside from the fundamentalists, few would mourn if he were found guilty. Conviction of Mr Shbeilat, on the other hand, a successful civil engineer and by far the most popular MP in the 80-member lower house of parliament, could prove more explosive. There have already been demonstrations outside the court protesting his innocence and the return of a guilty verdict could provoke a backlash. Many Jordanians believe the trial to be a warning shot to Islamic militants who won 33 seats in the 1989 parliamentary elections and, with the recent legalisation of political parties, are successfully gathering support for general elections in November next year. Mr Shbeilat's supporters believe the trial is a counter-action to the MP's calls for constitutional reform and his involvement in a parliamentary committee which investigated corruption charges against a number of former ministers, including Mr Zaid Rifai, a former prime minister. Even some of Mr Shbeilat's political opponents, among them some senior Jordanians, believe the case against the popular MP to be weak at best and even possibly contrived. Mr Abdul Karim Dughmi, lower house deputy speaker and former minister, one of Mr Shbeilat's original defence lawyers, argued: 'I am definitely sure that the case against Shbeilat was a conspiracy by certain powerful sides in the government to silence him politically.' Government sources insist, however, that the evidence against the defendants could not have been ignored. 'The threat of militant fundamentalists is a real one,' said one senior figure. 'If democracy is to succeed then we have to accept the judicial system.'</p>

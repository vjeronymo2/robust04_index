			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Books: Life on earth THE DIVERSITY OF LIFE by Edward O Wilson Allen Lane Pounds 22.50, 424 pages TAXONOMY has always seemed one of the most comforting and rewarding of biological disciplines. Anyone who has marvelled at the variation in a mass of bee orchids on a Mediterranean hillside, or attempted to distinguish between the small brown flycatchers that throng through an American woodland, will have had a small taste of the challenges in assigning individuals to species and subspecies, in fixing boundaries for what is often a continuum of life forms. The taxonomist's mill grinds ever smaller; more and more sophisticated tools are brought to bear on the most difficult knots of classification, always striving to mirror the precision with which evolution remorselessly sifts and orders its own production. The goal of this effort is far removed from the reality of a dusty herbarium or a formalin-pickled specimen; behind it all there's an intellectual challenge which in its own way is as elemental as any research in particle physics or creation cosmology. Now, as Edward Wilson demonstrates, taxonomy is big news. Wilson is an entomologist, an ant-man whose work on the species of the tropical rainforest has led him on to contemplate the larger pattern into which his classification fits. Species diversity, the range of living organisms to be found within a single habitat, is at its most luxuriant in the rainforest; there the niches into which animals and plants can adapt themselves are narrower and more ingenious than anywhere else on earth. And what we know of that range of species is still only a partial picture of life on earth; what has been named and classified - perhaps 1.5m species altogether - is still only a small fraction of the total waiting to be recorded, for which estimates range up towards 100m. In the face of this uncountable profusion, man has set about winnowing it with an effectiveness unparalleled in the history of life on earth. There have been mass extinctions before; the fossil record shows them punctuating geological time. But none threatens to be as comprehensive and savage as the one currently being meted out by one species on its fellows. Yes, the earth will probably make up the loss eventually, as it has always done before, but only after tens of millions of years, when the human race itself may well have joined the 99 per cent of the species that have once existed and are already extinct. Wilson unfolds this litany of disaster in an even, cool tone. First he celebrates the glories of bio-diversity, then painstakingly chronicles the human race's efforts to destroy it. His remedies, the ways in which habitats might be saved, demands for food and material production reconciled with the need to maintain diversity, are persuasively argued. It would be easy to allow a note of hysteria to creep in, to turn the agenda which Wilson presents in his final chapter into an emotional polemic. But the facts are always allowed to speak for themselves; in the final analysis, he concludes, what happens to the planet is an ethical decision for the human race: 'The stewardship of environment is a domain on the near side of metaphysics where all reflective persons can surely find common ground . . . An enduring environmental ethic will aim to preserve not only the health and freedom of our species, but access to the world in which the human spirit was born.' Sometimes repetitive, and encumbered by distinctly inappropriate line illustrations this is an important book. It takes the whole environmental issue on to a higher plane; more than the greenhouse effect or ozone depletion, it is habitat destruction that will affect the planet and the ecology which humans share with their congeners for as long as the race survives. 'One earth, one experiment', Wilson warns, and it is up to us whether we choose to pull the plug.</p>

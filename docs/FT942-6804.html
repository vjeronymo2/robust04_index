			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Madrid prosecutor quits Spain replaced its chief public prosecutor yesterday in the latest in a series of high-level resignations over the last four weeks. The departure of the controversial Mr Eligio Hernandez was not directly related to recent corruption cases. However, his impartiality had been called into question by opposition parties. A government spokesman denied that the move was connected to a forthcoming Supreme Court decision on Mr Hernandez's qualifications for the job, and said Mr Hernandez was leaving at his own request, submitted a fortnight ago. Professional legal associations challenged his appointment in 1992 on the grounds that he did not fulfil the criterion of 15 years' experience in the judiciary. The cabinet named Mr Carlos Granados, a Supreme Court judge, to replace him.</p>

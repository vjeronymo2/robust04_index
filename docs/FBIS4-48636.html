			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Patrick Bulger] </F>   [Text] Cape Town May 23 SAPA -- The cabinet on Monday  played down political differences arising from the KwaZulu land  transfer, presenting a united front on the day before President  Nelson Mandela's historic address to South Africa's first  all-race Parliament. Meeting at Tuynhuys from about 11AM until  well into the evening, the cabinet did not allow the land  transfer issue to develop into a controversy that could detract  from Mr Mandela's address.    A statement issued by Deputy Presidents Thabo Mbeki and F W  de Klerk said cabinet approached the discussion "with a view to  reaching a consensus that will contribute to the process of  nation-building and reconciliation". The statement said all the  parties reaffirmed their commitment to such an approach.    A cabinet committee was formed comprising Land Affairs  Minister Derek Hanekom and Ministers Kader Asmal, Roelf Meyer  and Ben Ngubane.    Both Mr Meyer and Dr Ngubane were central to the  constitutional negotiations process which formed the political  background to the passage of the Ingonyama [King's] Trust Act.  The legislation ceded 1.2 million hectares of communal land to  Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini.    The committee will report on the background and reasons for  the establishment of the trust, examine and report on the  implications of the act and make recommendations to the cabinet.  It will pay attention to security of tenure of residents in the  prescribed area, the functioning of a land claims court should  disputes arise, and the impact on a future land reform programme.    The land issue was discussed in cabinet following a meeting  between President Mandela and Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu  Buthelezi. After the meeting, Chief Buthelezi denied that the  land transfer had anything to do with securing his Inkatha  Freedom Party's participation in the elections in April.    However, the issue was resolved in less than two hours as  cabinet members turned their attention to Tuesday's opening of  Parliament and in particular Mr Mandela's speech to the nation.  Mr Mandela's speech is expected to set out his vision of how the  government of national unity will address South Africa's  political and socio-economic challenges in its five years of  existence.    Mr Mandela will speak after a ceremonial drive through  central Cape Town along streets lined with troops. There will be  a flypast and a 21-gun salute as he takes the salute from the  guard of honour.    Parliamentary staff were making last-minute preparations for  the opening and getting the historic house of Parliament into  shape for the event.    Cabinet colleagues apparently discussed aspects of Mr  Mandela's speech at length and made inputs.    Mr Mandela's staff were not giving away many clues, but he  is  expected to once again stress the importance of reconciliation.  "Reconciliation is important where there is a lot of  uncertainty," said a source close to the president's office.    "Our approach in general terms is that reconciliation and  social upliftment go together. We can never have true  reconciliation if the conditions of the people remain the same."    The source said Mr Mandela's speech would deal with the main  themes of the Reconstruction and Development Programme. Mr  Mandela would point to the need to make certain immediate  changes. These could involve the education system and a job  creation programme.    Mr Mandela will also be seeking to reassure potential  foreign  investors that strict fiscal discipline will be maintained in  the government's approach to reconstruction and development.</p>

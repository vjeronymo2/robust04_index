			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Survey of Corporate Finance (2): Top of the integrated banking structure - Morgan Stanley IF ever an advocate of the 'integrated' investment bank wanted to demonstrate the benefits of this structure, he would surely point to Wall Street in the 1990s. To back up his case, he could then cite a number of individual examples, but Morgan Stanley would probably be top of his list. Between two decades - the 1980s and 1990s - business opportunities for the investment banking community have undergone a sea change. In the 1980s, money was to be made in advising on acquisitions and hostile bids; running leveraged buy-out funds, which themselves often triggered, or at least participated in the takeover frenzy; and issuing debt-based securities, such as junk bonds, to line the acquirer's pockets. In the 1990s, the active areas have been corporate restructurings (although with fees often subject to bankruptcy court approval, these are generally less lucrative than bids); vulture investing in the securities of distressed companies; and the issuance and underwriting of new securities, often equity-based, as companies repair strained balance sheets. The implications of this turnround are fairly obvious. Boutiques which set up as bid or LBO specialists have either been obliged to sit out the recession with much reduced earnings, or rethink their strategy. In reality, many have responded by tacking on additional lines of business  - real estate services, some underwriting, restructuring expertise - in an attempt to combat the dearth of bid work. For the large integrated houses the task, superficially, has been simpler. After all, the downturn in bid work has been largely offset by the upturn in underwriting activity. But managing the turnround has been no simple assignment. Morgan Stanley, one of the largest blue chip Wall Street houses, probably exemplifies the point better than any. To look at the bank's bottom line, business has been bumpy but, under the circumstances, remarkably well-sustained. After-tax profits for 1987 (the year stock markets crashed worldwide) were Dollars 230.9m. They then recovered to Dollars 394.6m in 1988; soared to Dollars 443m in 1989; dipped back to Dollars 270.4m in 1990; and then hit Dollars 475.8m last year. Overall, the investment banking division appeared to echo this pattern. Here, revenues topped the Dollars 946m mark in 1989; slumped to Dollars 652.3m in 1990; and recovered to Dollars 823.5m in 1991. But it is the split in the investment banking division's figures which tell a much more meaningful story. In 1989, about Dollars 360m - less than half the the Dollars 946m total - came from underwriting activities, and the remainder from financial advisory work. In 1991, by contrast, two-thirds of the Dollars 823.5m figures derived from underwriting activities, the rest from advisory work. This switch in business mix has meant a rearrangement of staffing, and in Morgan Stanley's case a fair number of top management changes. According to Mr Robert Matschullat, head of investment banking, the head count in his division has remained flat. It totals about 668 worldwide, compared with about 680 five years ago. But Mr Matschullat acknowledges that there have been significant reductions in certain areas, such as mergers and acquisitions. To an extent, expertise in mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) can be switched to restructuring work. Individuals who advised on bids in the 1980s the reasoning runs, know the same client companies who now wish to restructure their finances. Neverthless, only six months ago, the bank announced the dismissal of 45 investment bankers, 6 per cent of the total, as it overhauled staffing requirements. Meanwhile, responsibilities among senior executives have been in a fairly fluid state. Mr Maschullat formally took up the reins of the investment banking division at the beginning of 1992, succeeding Mr Joseph Fogg, a veteran Wall Street dealmaker who quit after failing to secure a board seat. In mid-June, the newly-installed division head announced that Mr Bruce Fiedorek, formerly head of M&amp;A would take charge of a wider 'financing and strategic services' group. If the persistent management changes have derived partly from departures and the change in workload, they also owe a good deal to Morgan Stanley's determination to build up its international business. Globalisation is almost an article of faith at the bank - the theory being that if corporations become increasingly international in their scope, their demand for investment banking services will follow a similar trend. Morgan Stanley draws about half of its Dollars 2.8bn revenues from outside the US and Mr Richard Fisher, chairman, has suggested that the proportion could increase to about two thirds. Extensive branch offices range from Milan to Toronto and additions, in Europe and Asia, are likely in the near future. Morgan Stanley admits that the task of managing a worldwide personnel - in particular, deciding how much responsibility to devolve outside the US - is not always easy. In March, the bank appeared to rethink its approach, although the change is described as evolutionary rather than revolutionary. It set up a new operating committee under the charge of Mr John Mack, head of its fixed income division, to oversee day-to-day operations and to handle co-ordination between divisions. As part of the changes, it shifted four managing directors from New York to London and Tokyo - effectively running the group's worldwide government securities business from the UK. Finally, although underwriting has been a mainstay of profits, and the bank's earnings record is one of the most commendable on Wall Street, it should not be assumed that everything has been plain sailing on the new issue side. Although Morgan Stanley was third among the Wall Street houses in terms of underwriting earnings last year, it has been noted that the bank ranked only seventh for all common stock offerings and had a similar placing for initial public offerings. In the first quarter of 1992, when a flood of new issues descended, Morgan Stanley also came in seventh in terms of amounts raised from all domestic issues, down from fifth place in the first quarter of 1991. As for current trends, Mr Matshullat, like any banker seeking business, is the eternal optimist. Given the amount of equity which was retired during the 1980s he reasons that the stream of issues will continue, albeit with temporary fluctuations to allow for market digestion.</p>

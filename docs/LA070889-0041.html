			<p><P> July 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH PROPOSES HIKES IN FEDERAL PAY OF UP TO 25%  </P> <P> President Bush dove back into the politically messy issue of federal pay  increases Friday, calling for raises of up to 25% for federal judges and 8,000  of the government's top executive branch employees along with a ban on members  of Congress taking money for personal appearances.  </P> <P> Bush did not propose a congressional pay increase but Press Secretary Marlin  Fitzwater said that the President still supports the idea and will work with  congressional leaders to develop a politically acceptable proposal.  </P> <P> The whole issue of pay has been a logjam for years. Congress, which must vote  on all pay raises for federal employees, has strongly resisted allowing federal  workers to earn more than congressmen but has also been reluctant to raise its  own pay. A congressional pay raise was defeated in February amid a political  firestorm. At the same time, members of Congress are not willing to give up  honorariums without a pay increase.  </P> <P> Currently, senators and representatives are allowed to add to their pay by  taking money for speeches and other appearances -- up to 40% of their salary in  the Senate, 30% in the House. Bush's plan would eliminate that in two stages,  becoming fully effective when the next Congress is seated in January, 1991. It  is widely expected that any plan to raise the current $89,500 congressional  salary would be similarly phased in.  </P> <P> Bush and his aides have been saying that the President would propose a pay  increase ever since February, when increases of 51% for members of Congress and  federal judges were defeated. Repeatedly, Bush has said that he was waiting for  the right time. He chose a moment just before he departs Sunday for a 10-day  European trip, which should virtually guarantee that reaction to the pay plan  will not dominate the news.  </P> <P> Under Bush's plan, about 8,000 of the government's 2.2 million employees would  immediately get raises. The increases would range from 25% for the most senior  officials down to 8% for more junior executives, taking the salaries for top  civil servants over $100,000 for the first time. Vice President Dan Quayle  would also get a raise, from his current salary of $115,000 to $143,800. Bush's  own salary would stay at $200,000.  </P> <P> In addition, 200 new positions would be created with authorized salaries of as  much as $124,900. Government agencies could use those slots to recruit or  retain workers whose special skills are in high demand, such as physicists for  the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, doctors for the National  Institutes of Health and economists for the Commerce Department.  </P> <P> Given the relatively small number -- 200 positions to cover the entire  government -- those slots are expected to be the subject of intensive jockeying  among federal agencies. Virtually all federal agencies have been complaining of  a rapid drain of highly trained specialists into better paying jobs in the  private sector.  </P> <P> In a statement, Bush reiterated support for a 25% pay increase for the nation's  1,300 federal judges, a plan that he submitted earlier in the spring.  </P> <P> Overall, the plan would add almost $200 million annually to the federal budget.  Increasing judicial salaries would cost about $30 million a year. The raises  Bush plans for top federal workers would cost about $155 million a year,  including $8 million for the 200 new specialists' jobs. And indirectly, Bush's  plan would cost roughly another $10 million that would go to some 1,100 senior  civil servants whose pay is now capped to prevent them from earning more than  their bosses. If their supervisors receive a raise, their pay automatically  would increase.  </P> <P> The plan came under immediate fire from some federal workers unions, who  objected that Bush's plan would directly or indirectly provide large raises for  9,000 of the government's highest paid employees while he proposes to hold the  vast bulk of federal workers to a 3.6% increase. White House officials defended  the proposal, arguing that salaries for most federal workers are roughly  comparable to pay in the private sector but that pay at the top levels has  fallen seriously behind.  </P> <P> Pay for top federal administrators "has slipped from 66% to 39% of the pay of  the lower range of private corporate executives," Fitzwater said, "key  scientific, medical and economic jobs remain unfilled in our Administration due  to non-competitive pay."  </P> <P> Bush also would require federal officials who receive the increases to undergo  reviews every three years to demonstrate that they still deserve the extra pay.  </P> <P> Salaries for senior federal officials have risen relatively slowly. As a  result, not only corporate executives, but also local government officials,  currently earn more than federal executives, with most school superintendents  in large cities, for example, earning more than federal agency directors.  </P> <P> Currently, Cabinet secretaries earn $99,500, their deputies earn $89,500 and  salaries for top federal managers below that rank range from $68,700 to  $82,500. Under Bush's plan, Cabinet secretaries would get a raise to $124,000,  deputy secretaries would earn $111,900 and the range for top managers would run  from $74,500 to $103,100. The wider range of salaries is designed to restore a  pay ladder to the senior civil service, where many officials find that long  before retirement they have hit the salary ceiling and cannot hope to earn more  without leaving government.  </P> <P> Given the concentration of top-level federal officials in Washington, the  raises would have their greatest impact here. According to the federal Office  of Personnel Management, however, roughly 3% of the federal workers eligible  for raises under Bush's plan are located in California.  </P></p>

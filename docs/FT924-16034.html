			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Bank of Scotland slips 2% BANK OF Scotland yesterday warned that it was continuing to suffer from substantial losses on loans and was doubtful there would be any improvement in the rest of the year. The gloomy prediction was made as Scotland's second biggest bank disclosed that pre-tax profits in the six months to August 31 were Pounds 74.2m, some 2 per cent down on the comparable Pounds 75.7m. The provision to cover actual and possible losses on bad and doubtful debts was Pounds 138m, up from Pounds 121m in 1991. Though the charge was high given the bank's record, it was running at a lower level as a proportion of loans than the charges of the four English clearing banks. Mr Peter Burt, chief general manager, said his bank's bad debts were probably less severe than rivals' because it had a relatively small lending exposure in the south of England, where borrowers were having the worst problems. It also bucked the trend of the English banks by increasing the volume of loans it made. Its sterling loan book rose by 7 per cent, while its competitors' loan books have been shrinking or stagnating. Most of the loan growth came from an increase in its home mortgage business. However, the bank also lifted its share of the declining small business loan market, according to Mr Burt. Fees and commissions earned by its main banking operation rose 18 per cent to Pounds 115.3m. 'We are getting much better at collecting charges', Mr Burt explained. Apart from the bad debt provision, the bank's profits were also depressed by a further Pounds 60m to Pounds 70m in interest which was owed to the bank but not paid. Its net interest earnings were also hit by 'upward pressure' on the average cost of deposits. The bank pointed out that although bank base rates had been falling this year, they had been below money market rates. Deposit rates were often directly or indirectly linked to money market rates. However, the bank said that the return or margin it made from lending in underlying terms, excluding exceptional factors, continued to improve. Mr Burt said that a month ago he thought the bad debt charge would continue to rise in the coming months. Following sterling's withdrawal from the Exchange Rate Mechanism and the subsequent fall in base rates, he was now hopeful that bad debts would stabilise. But he added: 'There will not be an improvement till the economy improves. There are no encouraging signs. . . Thank God we are out of the ERM'. Earnings per share were 3.2p (3.6p) and the interim dividend is lifted to 1.77p (1.7p). See Lex</p>

			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Personal View: Still on track for a single currency The old, reviled exchange rate mechanism proved to be 'half baked' as a stage towards a single European currency. But we should not forget its benefits during the 14 years that it lasted. It helped get inflation down, and it gave many banks windfall profits during the recession. Above all, it gave us five years of currency stability when the single market needed to demolish trade barriers. The new, floating ERM could result in competitive interest rate cuts, devaluations and protectionist responses inimical to further progress of the single market. A return to autarkic nationalism can be avoided only if the new ERM is used by governments as a more effective stage towards the single currency than the old one. The case for one market, one money, is as strong as ever. The old ERM required fixed, nominal exchange rates as a condition of entry into the single currency. What membership of a single currency area needs, however, is fixed real exchange rates. Otherwise misaligned exchange rates cause countries to become uncompetitive and to be a financial charge on their neighbours. Fixed real exchange rates, with nominal rates adapting to reflect changes in relative competitiveness, are arguably a better preparation for a single currency than fixed nominal rates. The upheavals of September 1992 and the realignments that followed left the exchange rate structure with better relative competitiveness between countries. If inflation continues to be low and convergent, in the 2-4 per cent range in leading countries, nominal exchange rates may not need to change much for the next few years. The move to 15 per cent bands with no change in central parities - the one option that none of the experts foresaw - may come to be seen as an inspired leap in the dark. It preserves the letter of the system while changing the spirit. Under the terms of the Maastricht treaty it will be sufficient for countries to remain within the 15 per cent bands, which will be wide enough for them not to need to change central parities because of divergences in short-term interest rates. If countries can achieve the low inflation criterion, then they can remain competitive with only minor nominal exchange rate fluctuations. The rate at which they enter the single currency will, according to Maastricht, be the prevailing market rate and not the central parity. The new ERM will allow other countries to follow Britain's lead in cutting interest rates. Even if this results in short-term weakening of their currencies against the D-Mark, countries such as France can also expect to follow the UK in seeing their currencies rise against the D-Mark because of higher growth and lower inflation than Germany. A general loosening of monetary policy will both require and facilitate the tightening of fiscal policy that many EMS countries are now undertaking. As the recovery gathers pace, it will bring about a cyclical reduction in deficits and make it easier to carry out structural deficit cuts without aborting expansion and incurring political odium. A strategy of this kind could see the single currency rising like a phoenix from the ashes of the old ERM. The UK is again in danger of being isolated by over-estimating the difficulties of monetary union, and under-estimating the political will of its partners to achieve it. With barely concealed schadenfreude, it appears to be advising other members of the convoy to slow down to its own pace. So what should Britain do to be at the heart of Europe? 1. Join the ERM at about DM2.50 as the central parity. The 15 per cent bands have removed any constraint on freedom to cut interest rates, while maintaining a discipline to prevent a lapse into double-digit inflation as in the late 1980s. 2. Discuss with other ERM countries plans to move to a single currency by 1997 or 1999. The UK may not decide whether to opt in until 1998, but it must make sure that monetary union suits its interests as much as those of its partners. 3. Drop the plan for a hard Ecu. It is even less viable in a floating monetary system than in a relatively fixed one. It would confuse the markets to have the hard Ecu alongside the existing Ecu, making not one but 14 currencies. The existing Ecu could be hardened, but there is a case for keeping the present basket definition, which has so far won the day. The hard Ecu would be seen by others as an attempt to lead them off the trail to a single currency.

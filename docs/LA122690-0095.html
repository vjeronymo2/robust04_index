			<p><P> December 26, 1990, Wednesday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> MAN DIES IN SHERMAN OAKS FIRE  </P> <P> A 75-year-old man who lived in a hillside home overlooking the San Fernando  Valley was found dead in his bedroom this morning after fire raced through the  house, authorities said.  </P> <P> The cause of the 1 a.m. fire in the 15400 block of Briarwood Drive in Sherman  Oaks was not known, but investigators were looking into the possibility that an  electric heater may have sparked the blaze that caused an estimated $560,000 in  damage.  </P> <P> Los Angeles police described the victim, whose name was not released while  investigators attempted to learn if he had any family, as a "pack rat." He had  filled much of the house with newspapers, magazines and other belongings. There  were several heaters spaced throughout the house, police said.  </P> <P> Los Angeles firefighters took 50 minutes to extinguish the fire that apparently  erupted in the middle section of the ranch-style house on a hill overlooking  the San Diego Freeway and the West Valley. Firefighters said the house was  gutted by the fire, and a car was also destroyed.  </P> <P> Police investigators were called to the scene because firefighters found what  appeared to be a bump-like injury on the victim's head. But neighbors told  officers that the victim already had the deformity and foul play was ruled out.  </P> <P> "It appears he died as a result of smoke inhalation," Detective Don Tabak said.  "There is no evidence of foul play."  </P></p>

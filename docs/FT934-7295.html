			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Problems at Merrett Group intensify THE PROBLEMS of the Merrett Group were intensified yesterday by the resignation of three senior executives. Mr Dennis Purkiss, group chief executive, is to take a prominent position with a leading UK company. Mr Ken Barrett, the underwriter of syndicates 1066, 67 and 68 - which Merrett had intended to merge into syndicate 1067 next year - and Mr Stewart Laderman, the underwriter of 418's non-marine division, have also accepted positions outside the group 'where they perceive to be better able to sustain their personal underwriting aspirations'. Mr Stephen Merrett, chairman, said in a briefing note to staff that discussions were 'in progress to determine the future arrangements in covering their various responsibilities'. Mr Barrett became active underwriter of 1067 in July this year after the resignation of Mr Stephen Burnhope.</p>

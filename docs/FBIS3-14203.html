The  two suspects in the Lockerbie attack against a Panam plane in  1988 are reported to have agreed to go to The Hague to appear  before the International Court of Justice on condition that  Scottish judges are present. An official of the Libyan  parliament, Sa'd Mijbir, who is visiting Paris, confirms this  information to Adala Benraad:    [Begin Mijbir recording] A Scottish professor has proposed  that the two suspects go to The Hague to be tried in the  presence of Scottish magistrates. We have been informed by the  lawyers of the two suspects that their clients have agreed and  that they will go to The Hague of their own free will. We have  accepted this proposal and we hope that the United States and  the UK will accept too because this proposal paves the way to a  peaceful, fair, and legal solution. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / The Long View: The tipster's torment especially on airline food, but also occasionally on financial markets. Which is why I was puzzled to find my old friend Steve the strategist in an unusually reflective mood when he passed through London this week. He had a new challenge: he had been invited to take part in one of the round-table investment sessions featured by Barron's, the American financial weekly. 'Congratulations', I said. 'This is your chance to become one of the stars of the US financial media. Peter Lynch and Jim Rogers will eat their hearts out.' Steve frowned. 'This is no ego trip', he said. 'My presentation must be carefully positioned. My regular professional clients are not going to pay a small fortune in soft dollars for my opinions if they think they can read it all for Dollars 2.50, even if that is hard cash. As for my firm, the idea is to boost the sales of our mutual funds arm, not to give away our institutional advice. That hems me in pretty tight.' I observed that investment tipsters are much thinner on the ground in the British media than in the US. That might partly reflect the meagre interest in financial matters in the UK, but perhaps also a native cynicism about motivation. After all, Jim Slater in the Independent had been sniped at from all around. 'Sure, from my viewpoint the whole theoretical basis of stock market opinions is complex', said Steve, in his usual model-building manner. 'On the conscious plane, practitioners are going to hold something back, and may even deliberately mislead. Subconsciously, too, they may be under pressure to talk their book, even when they don't realise it, which is why investor opinion surveys have to be treated so carefully. 'Ask yourself, why would a professional money manager recite a list of his favourite stocks into a newspaper's tape recorder? The politest thing you can say is that his first loyalty must be to his clients. Therefore you can bet that all his buying programmes have been completed, certainly in the illiquid stocks. 'He would be crazy to spoil the market in his real hot stocks, the ones he is actually buying. So basically he is trying to massage up the prices of his major holdings. It's a small step from there to say that he might be attempting to create some counter-party demand into which he can offload.' Hence, I remarked, the old stock market saying that 'A tip is a tap.' At least, he was under rather less pressure in that his main focus was on markets rather than individual stocks. 'Sure, a mention in a press article isn't going to shift the Tokyo market', said Steve, 'but people normally want an individual recommendation or two to focus on. Besides, these days we seem to be promoting emerging markets where there are typically only three or four stocks of any size, one brewery, the president's family construction company and two banks busy laundering the cocaine money.' But allocations to emerging markets were small, I said. Meanwhile there were some quite strong views among professional investors about major markets - for example, that Wall Street was expensive. 'Certainly there are some strong views emerging from the surveys right now', said Steve. 'I make a special study of these. I was just this morning looking at a local poll in our London office, Godwins' Cityscope, which collates the opinions of leading UK money management houses. It has been highly bullish all year about equities but weak to neutral about gilts. Yet gilts have outperformed. So why have the experts all been wrong? 'The point is', he continued, 'such opinion polls must be viewed in a dynamic rather than a static way. Look at it like this: most UK pension funds have 60 per cent of their portfolios in UK equities. The managers have to believe the UK equity market is going up, otherwise they logically would be big sellers. At the same time, the exposure to US equities is only 5 per cent, half the neutral weighting. They give Wall Street the thumbs down. But although such surveys claim to tell us about the future, they really only tell us about the past. 'In fact, the more optimistic the opinion the more dangerous the market risks may have become. When the last bear has turned bullish the market is at its peak. That's how it works with US mutual fund inflows, one of the most famous cyclical indicators. Record inflows tell you that the market is near a high. 'At the other end of the cycle, a mutual fund selling panic tells you that there will soon be real value around. It's when strong opinions change that the real action can happen. Recently, of course, US mutual funds have been selling in unbelievable volume.' So what is Steve going to tell US retail investors? 'Markets are high', he said. 'This is not the time to be chasing value to the ends of the earth and winding up in the Colombian stock market. Funnily enough, although it's not really my scene as a strategist, it's a time for stockpickers. Overall market levels may be moving sideways or marginally higher, but just look at the individual stock price movements. Investors put a huge premium on recovery and growth, then withdraw when the earnings numbers disappoint. There are some great trading opportunities, and if I were running portfolios, imagine the advantage of being able to create my own exits.' So would he really be setting out his favourite stocks? Steve shifted awkwardly in his seat. 'Let's say that I have my own agenda. Look at it this way, my firm pays me a lot of money, but readers of newspapers expect something for nothing. Loyalty comes first. If I mention a few stocks, don't be at all surprised if entirely coincidentally there turn out to be some equity underwritings in the next few weeks.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with 'Abd al-'Aziz 'Abd-al Ghani, </F> member of the Yemeni Presidential Council, by Mouna Naim; place  and date not given: "Yemen: 'Abd-al Ghani Condemns  `Interference' by Saudi Arabia, other Gulf Countries"]    [Text] 'Abd-al 'Aziz 'Abd-al Ghani is convinced that if  there had been no foreign interference, war would not have  broken out between northerners and southerners, who could thus  have settled their differences through dialogue. On a stopover  in Paris, the Yemeni vice president [as published], who is a  northerner though he rejects the definition in the name of the  country's unity, was received by Jean Vidal, diplomatic adviser  to Mr. Mitterrand, on Thursday, 8 June. He was also due to meet  with Denis Bauchard, the Foreign Ministry's North Africa and  Middle East desk chief.    By "foreign interference," Mr. 'Abd-al Ghani meant the  support granted to the leaders of the Yemeni Socialist Party  (YSP), which governs in Aden, by the Gulf countries, and more  specifically Saudi Arabia. He said that the oil monarchies "do  not want to see the emergence in this region of a strong,  densely populated (14 million inhabitants -- LE MONDE editor's  note) state that possesses oil and that is moreover a democratic  republic."    Mr. 'Abd-al Ghani omitted to say that the conflict between  the YSP and the General People's Congress (GPC) of the  (northern) president, 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, over power sharing  and a constitutional framework for the state has been growing  worse for almost a year and that YSP cadres and assets have been  the target of a number of attacks, without this overly upsetting  the central government, however. And though he admitted that  there were some problems, he only acknowledged that 'Ali Salim  al-Bid, leader of the south before the proclamation of unity in  1990, has never agreed to become second-in-command in the  unified state.    Mr. 'Abd al-Ghani said that he would not have leveled  charges  at the oil monarchies, but for the following facts: "Articles  in the Kuwaiti press stating that the emirate would be willing  to spend its last cent to achieve the partitioning of Yemen, and  a visit to Riyadh in February by former Vice President al-Bid,  amid great publicity and with full honors." The same, he said,  applies to a statement by the Kuwaiti foreign minister, citing  the possibility of working for the "recognition" of the  "Democratic Republic of Yemen" proclaimed by Aden and its  "recent implicit recognition by the countries of the Gulf  Cooperation Council." Not to mention the fact that weapons  "have continued to arrive at Mukalla" in the south in recent  months. "So who funded these purchases?" Mr. 'Abd-al Ghani  asked.    For all these reasons the Sanaa government is convinced that  it was on the instigation of "foreign parties" that the YSP  leaders initiated hostilities, with the aim of proclaiming a  secession. As for the southerners, they blame the northerners  for the outbreak of war, secession being only the unavoidable  result.  <H5>  `Weakening the Country' </H5>   Mr. 'Abd-al Ghani is convinced that Saudi Arabia and the  other oil monarchies are acting "not out of love for the Yemenis  of the south or for Mr. al-Bid, but in order to weaken the  country." While admitting that Riyadh also finances the  powerful Hashid tribe, loyal to the central government, he  believes that this is also in order to split the Yemenis and to  keep several irons in the fire. "Our brothers in the Gulf also  want to punish us for our stance" in support of Iraq during the  Gulf war. "Despite everything, we want to maintain good  relations with them," he said.    Though fighting continues, despite successive cease-fires,  Mr. 'Abd-al Ghani reaffirmed the Sanaa government's  determination to "safeguard unity" by peaceful means but also,  if necessary, by war. As for a possible dialogue with the  "secessionists," this remains dependent, he said, on the  relinquishment of separation and the exclusion of those who  proclaimed it, and especially of Mr. al-Bid.</p>

			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> U.S. HARDENS STAND ON SETTLEMENTS  </P> <P> U.S. policy has hardened against new Israeli settlements in the occupied  territories, and the United States will no longer defend Israeli expansion  before the United Nations, a senior Administration official said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The official, speaking with United Press International on the condition he not  be identified, defined what he said is a difference between the Bush  Administration and past administrations: "We will not, we cannot, support  further establishment of settlements, and they (the Israelis) shouldn't expect  us to support or defend them in the United Nations. I'm not sure that's been  done before."  </P> <P> The Reagan Administration, while criticizing settlements as "an obstacle to  peace," did not actively oppose them.  </P> <P> The Israeli government, saying that further settlements are necessary for the  security of the state, has announced the establishment of two new settlements  in the last two weeks.  </P></p>

			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / G7 officials take hard look at record of EBRD MR Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, said yesterday the Group of Seven leading industrial countries was debating the role of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development after disclosures of extravagance in the setting up of its London headquarters. At a press briefing in Paris, before travelling to Russia for talks with President Boris Yeltsin, Mr Bentsen confirmed he had discussed the EBRD's low disbursements with the G7 partners, but declined to give details. Asked whether there was a case for removing Mr Jacques Attali, the bank's president, Mr Bentsen said: 'I think that is for the Europeans.' The other G7 members are Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Canada and Italy. It emerged yesterday that a meeting in Paris on Wednesday night of the G7 deputies - the senior finance ministry officials - dropped some planned agenda items and was devoted entirely to discussing the EBRD. It is understood that it covered the bank's low disbursement of funds to the former Communist countries, questions surrounding its top management and the need for better relations between the countries that own the bank and the people who run it. According to a G7 official close to the group, some of the senior finance ministry officials present believed Mr Attali should be replaced. The G7 countries, which together have a majority stake in the bank, have been discussing possible candidates, the official added. Mr Attali is reported to be fighting for his job and there is no sign that the governments of the countries and agencies that own the bank, set up two years ago, have decided to remove him. His continuation in office is creating special difficulties for the US. Congress has refused to vote funds to pay a tranche of capital for the EBRD. There are also fears that it will be reluctant to vote additional funds for other international financial institutions, on which the US is relying to channel aid and expertise to Russia and other former Communist states. In a move that may have been inspired by recent allegations about the EBRD, Mr Bentsen said the US wanted to set up an aid utilisation office in Moscow 'to make certain that every bit of money that goes to the transition effort is spent wisely'. Canadian and US officials have been particularly critical in the past few weeks of Mr Attali's performance.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Graham Brown] </F>   [Text] Brussels, May 25 (AFP) -- The relief was palpable  at NATO here Wednesday [25 May] after Russia signalled it was  ready to join the Western alliance's programme of military  partnership amid pledges of a new nonaggressive post-Cold War  military doctrine.    Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev declared on several  occasions on Tuesday and Wednesday that Moscow would set no  conditions for joining the Partnership for Peace (PFP) programme.    However, he said Russia still wanted regular political  consultations on European and global security with NATO on a  regular and emergency basis. There was no immediate NATO  response.    Grachev was speaking at a meeting of defence ministers from  the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation with their counterparts  from the former Soviet bloc.    U.S. Secretary of State William Perry said Grachev had given  an "excellent presentation" on Russia's new nonaggressive  post-Cold War military doctrine, and expressed pleasure at  Russia's pledge to join the PFP.    NATO countries had been worried that Russia would present a  list of unacceptable demands for joining the PFP, which was  launched in January and groups the Western alliance with  countries of the former Soviet bloc.    Their fears had been fuelled by months of conflicting  statements from officials and politicians in Russia, ranging  from support for military cooperation with the West, to outright  chauvinistic refusal.    "But today we are relieved and happy," one diplomat said.    British Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind told journalists:  "It is looking very good. Russia clearly wants to play a  constructive role, working on issues of common interest."    A NATO official said: "Nobody here wants confrontation,  neither NATO nor the Russians. Everybody here wants to  cooperate with the Russians."    Perry confirmed that a compromise was emerging -- that  Russia  would not get the treaty on political relations with NATO that  it had sought, but could bank on special cooperation on nuclear  issues such as arms control.    Diplomats said this was a face-saving compromise for Russian  leaders which would allow them to claim at home that the West  regarded Moscow as a nuclear super-power more influential than  its East European neighbours.    Grachev reiterated that Russia was not insisting on special  political links with NATO as the price for signing the PFP,  which has already been joined by 16 countries of the old Soviet  bloc.    But he announced he would present NATO later Wednesday with  proposals for specific Russia-NATO cooperation, involving a  "protocol of intention or programmes specific to Russia-NATO  cooperation."    Some countries, particularly the United States, say they do  not want NATO-Russia links formalised on paper, but to evolve  depending on Russian cooperation in the PFP programme.    A Polish diplomat warned that Warsaw and other East European  countries would not accept Russian involvement in NATO decisions  concerning their security.    "Our political standpoint is that there should be nothing  about us without us," he said, citing a Polish proverb.    An example of what Poland would not accept, the diplomat  said, was a proposal from Moscow for joint Russia-NATO security  guarantees over countries such as Poland.    But Perry said fears that NATO and Russia might divide up  East Europe into Cold War-style spheres of influence were  "entirely inappropriate and misplaced."</p>

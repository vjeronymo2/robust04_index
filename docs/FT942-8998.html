			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Insurers gloomy about prospects Encouraging customers to look ahead and consider the ills that could befall them is a classic pitch for selling life insurance. The life industry itself might be forgiven for being in sombre mood as it contemplates what lies ahead. Certainly some in the industry believe that the fall in new life and pensions business revealed in the statistics from the Association of British Insurers for the first three months of this year represents more than a passing cloud. The combination of tougher regulatory requirements and intensifying competition looks like having an enduring and damping impact on the amount of new business written in the months to come. The reluctance of some leading companies to be drawn on the figures tells its own story. Regulation seems to have acted as a depressant on new business in more than one way. On pensions business, the association highlighted the effect on single-premium pension business of the uncertainty created by the regulators' review of pension transfers launched in December after a pilot study caused widespread concern about standards of selling. That uncertainty has affected not only customers but also life insurers: some of them are still not writing any pension transfer business and others are being more cautious. More generally, Mr Steve Maran, chief executive of Lloyds Abbey Life, is among those to have highlighted the effort that needs to be put into meeting new standards in training and the sales process as a diversion from current selling. Others suggest that the concentration on dealing with new regulatory requirements may have detracted from designing new products to meet new customer needs. As Mr Tom King, general manager in charge of marketing at Standard Life, put it: 'Product development has perhaps not kept pace with the changing market.' Association figures suggest that life companies have also been affected by other forms of savings such as personal equity plans (Peps) and tax-exempt special savings accounts (Tessas). The success of some National Savings products, already identified as contributing to successive monthly outflows from building societies' retail deposits, may be another factor. One company commented: 'Investment performance hasn't been that great, so perhaps customers did not think it worth the risk to go for life products rather than National Savings.'</p>

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Dutch usher in the age of the self-milking cow - State of the art machinery could make the herdsman redundant in the dairy parlour / Farmer's Viewpoint MY FIRST job as a 16-year old farm student on a neighbouring farm was milking cows. It was not planned that way - the intention was that during the 12 months I was to work on the farm I would be given a variety of arable and livestock jobs to broaden my experience. But when I took up my post one of the regular herdsmen was having an illicit affair with another herdsman's wife. The day I arrived the cuckold found out and punched his colleague in the mouth, breaking his jaw. Needless to say they refused to work together again and I was drafted into the cow shed to fill the gap. I bet you thought such excitement only took place in towns. At my tender age and in my innocence I too was a little shocked. It taught me a little about human weakness and a lot about dairy cows. Believe it or not milking can be a very satisfying job. You get to know the animals by name. Or at least you did then, before herds got so big that they started giving cows numbers. It must be more difficult to establish a relationship with number 123 than with Ada or Mabel. And apart from the inevitable inconvenience of the fact that it had to be done twice every day of the year it was a job I really enjoyed doing. But if new technology from the Netherlands catches on in this country the herdsmen of tomorrow may be denied the hands-on pleasures of pulling milk out of cows. The fully automatic milking machine has been the dream of some enthusiasts for years but until recently the difficulty of developing a device to accomodate different shapes of udders and placings of teats has proved too much. Now, it is claimed, the Dutch have cracked it. A few machines are already operating in Holland and it is expected that the first will be installed in the UK within a matter of months. In truth the automatic milker is an inevitable and logical development. Any task that is repeated daily and is labour intensive will attract the attention of technologists. Moreover the hand-operated milking machine introduced half a century ago, even before I started doing the job, was the first breakthrough. Overnight one man, who had been hand-milking perhaps 10 cows a session into an open bucket, could deal with 40 or 50 cows and do so more hygienically and thoroughly. Some years later automatic cluster removers enabled that figure to be more than doubled. The cow man attaches the cluster of four teat cups to each cow by hand, but when the udder is empty and the flow of milk ceases a cord attached to the teat cups gently pulls them off. It saves internal damage to the empty teats from continuous vaccuum pressure when it is not needed to draw milk. It has led to fewer cases of diseases such as mastitis. Other electronic labour saving devices have also been introduced to dairying over the years. In some herds, for instance, cows wear collars containing tiny transponders. These are programmed by the computer in the dairy to trigger the individually desired delivery of feed to the cow concerned when, of her own free will, she enters an enclosed feeding stall. When she has eaten her fill the device lets her out and another cow in to repeat the process. Pedometers with radio transmitters are sometimes fixed to cows' front legs to measure their activity rate. Increased activity, again recorded on the computer in the dairy, indicates she is on heat and ready for artificial insemination. A decreased in her activity could mean that she is ill. It is also possible, by fitting special thermometers into the milking machine, to measure the heat of the milk drawn from each cow and each teat. A rise in the temperature, once more recorded on a computer, indicates that the cow has a fever, maybe sickening for some disease and probably needs treatment. Most of these hi-tech developments have been incorporated into the new automatic milking machine. The cow decides, according to the fullness of her udder, when she wishes to be relieved of the burden of her milk. She enters the milking stall and is identified by the transponder round her neck. The computer causes a little feed to fall into the trough in the stall. Then comes the really clever bit. The computer delves into its memory bank for the shape of the udder of the cow in the stall. It then instructs the pneumatic cylinders which control the teat cups exactly where to attach them. After a few days' training apparently, the cow does not object. Once successfully attached, the milking procedure begins with automatic teat washing inside the teat cup. The washings are then discarded and the inside of the cup rinsed clean. After that, milking takes place in the normal way and the cow is released from the stall. If at any point the procedure goes wrong, the whole process is aborted, the cow is released into a holding pen and an alarm is sounded to alert the herdsman that he is needed after all. As will be deduced from all this, milk production can be a technical and sophisticated business, although in truth very few dairy farmers have all the gadgets I have described. It may perhaps be surprising, therefore, that a similar level of sophistication has seldom shown itself in dairy farmers' approach to marketing. The fact is, of course, that it has not been necessary for the last 60 years since the advent of the Milk Marketing Boards. The boards have a statutory duty to buy and pay the same price for all milk (according to quality) from all milk producers whether they do it on top of Mount Snowdon or inside the M25. But that situation is fast drawing to a close as the boards are wound up (April 1, 1994 is the target date) and then Britain will once again have a free market for milk. The Milk Marketing Board of England and Wales intends to turn itself into a producer-owned co-operative and hopes to secure committments to purchase 80 per cent of its present turnover and broker it to other milk users. Other companies, such as Northern Foods, Nestles, MD Foods and Unigate, on the other hand, hope substantial numbers of milk producers will sell direct to them, by-passing Milk Marque, as the new co-operative will be called. So, over the next few months, milk producers will be faced with a difficult choice. Do they stick with the people they know and hope they can trust at Milk Marque but run the risk that it will ultimately fail like so many UK agricultural co-operatives before it? Or do they sign up with a commercial outfit with a proven record of adding value but risk having ex-farm milk prices squeezed as buyers respond to market pressures and shareholders demands for maximum profits? It is a choice most would prefer not to have to make and as each of the players makes their increasingly aggresive pitch for milk producers over coming weeks it is anybody's guess how the future structure of the milk business will pan out. But it will be a fierce battle - that much is quite certain. I just hope there will be no broken jaws.</p>

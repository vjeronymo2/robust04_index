This notice also makes available to the public the substance of the Service's proposed Finding of No Significant Impact which results from the EA. The Service has finalized the selection of the preferred alternative set out in the EA, i.e., to amend the 1916 Convention Between the United States and Great Britain for the Protection of Migratory Birds (Convention) to allow a regulated migratory bird subsistence harvest during what is now the closed period of March 10 to September 1. The final EA is available from the Service upon request at either of the addresses provided below (See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  and/or  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> ). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The decision stated in the Finding of No Significant Impact will be effective no earlier than August 8, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The contact point for this matter is: Director (FWS/MBMO), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 634 ARLSQ, 1849 C St., NW., Washington, DC 20240; or Regional Director (MBC), Region 7, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1011 E.

Apparently, the framers of the Convention were aware of migratory bird subsistence hunting activity but unaware of the extent to which it was needed and practiced by far northern rural peoples. Thus, the Convention provides inadequately for this particular subsistence use, with the result that much of the current subsistence hunting activity is illegal. However, restricting subsistence hunting to a time period outside of that in which birds are available neither provides equitable access to the resource nor accommodates customary and traditional uses. Because the Service recognizes the legitimate need for equitable access to the migratory bird resource for subsistence purposes, regulatory strategies have been under evaluation which would bring about successful resolution of the problem. The Service has recently completed the environmental assessment process regarding this issue and the results are contained in the final EA titled ``Regulation of Migratory Bird Subsistence Hunting in Alaska,'' dated May 1994. All comments received during the review of the draft EA have been considered in the preparation of the final EA. The Service has also completed a proposed Finding of No Significant Impact for the EA process, which is as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> Finding of No-Significant Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 --> Finding of no significant impact for managing migratory bird subsistence hunting in Alaska <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> On the basis of the final environmental assessment analysis contained in the document titled ``Managing Migratory Bird Subsistence Hunting in Alaska'' and dated May 1994, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service finds that no significant impacts will result from the action to be taken to amend the 1916 Convention Between the U.S. and Great Britain [For Canada] For the Protection of Migratory Birds (Convention). The Service examined five alternatives for dealing with the subsistence hunting of migratory bird issue, which are: (1) maintaining the status quo; (2) expanding the universe of cooperative agreements; (3) enforcing the terms of the current Convention; (4) amending the Convention; and (5) amending the Migratory Bird Treaty Act to allow subsistence hunting outside of the Convention. Action modifiers which specify how subsistence harvest of migratory birds would be managed were considered in conjunction with the five alternatives. Amendment of the Convention is the Service's preferred strategy for resolving problems associated with the illegal subsistence hunting of migratory birds by far northern peoples in Alaska and Canada. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

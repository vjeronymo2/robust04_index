			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / International Company News: Companies issue a new record - Raising finance is a booming activity Companies worldwide raised a total of Dollars 1,500bn in debt and equity financing last year, and investment bankers hope that if international markets compensate for an expected slowdown in US underwriting activity more records could be broken in 1994. According to Securities Data, the US financial information group, Dollars 1,100bn of corporate debt and equity was issued in the US last year, with another Dollars 404bn issued on the Eurobond and international equities markets. The total easily eclipsed the previous record of Dollars 1,100bn, set in 1992. The driving force behind the global underwriting bonanza was low interest rates and buoyant stock markets. A rush of privatisations in Europe, rapid growth in emerging financial markets, heavy demand from institutional and individual investors for stock and bonds, and the continued trend among US companies to lighten their debt loads, were also important. As always, US capital markets dominated the global scene. Domestic financing in the US topped Dollars 1,000bn for the first time, and shattered the previous record of Dollars 856bn, set in 1992. The rush among US companies to refinance existing debt at lower rates pushed total corporate bond issuance to Dollars 422bn last year, up 37 per cent on 1992's record figure. The big story in the corporate bond sector was the frenzy in the high-yield or junk market, where companies with debt rated below investment grade stampeded to raise money. The volume of junk bond sales reached Dollars 54bn, more than the total issued in the previous three years. It was an astonishing recovery from 1990, when only Dollars 1.4bn was issued in the wake of the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert, the Wall Street investment bank that had pioneered the issue of high-yield debt. The junk bond market thrived for two reasons: companies with low investment ratings rushed to raise funds, either to pay off expensive debt with cheaper credit or to meet tough repayment schedules; and securities paying high returns were in demand from investors frustrated with low yields on traditional corporate debt and equity. The strong performance of US share prices persuaded many companies that the time was right to raise money through new stock issues last year. A total of Dollars 102bn was raised from the sale of common stock in 1993, 40 per cent more than the previous year. The market for initial public offerings of stock (IPOs) was particularly busy as more than 800 companies went public in the rush to take advantage of high equity valuations and insatiable demand from investors. At the end of the year, IPO volume had reached an all-time high of Dollars 57bn, up from Dollars 40bn in 1992. The huge volume of underwriting business last year delighted Wall Street securities firms, who between them earned Dollars 9.1bn in fees and so smashed the 1992 record of Dollars 6.8bn. Merrill Lynch was the biggest underwriter for the sixth consecutive year, followed by Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley and Salomon Brothers. The big question on Wall Street today is whether 1994 can match last year. The consensus is yes - but only if international activity grows strongly. US interest rates are forecast to rise this year, which will cut the size of corporate debt issuance. Also, demand from investors for stock and bonds is expected to shrink. Consequently, financing activity is likely to slow down in 1994, although the sale of new stock and bonds by companies to finance mergers and takeovers may help offset some of the declines. Ultimately, however, investment bankers are relying on the international capital markets to pick up the slack from the US. Interest rates in Europe and elsewhere are expected to continue to fall or stay historically low in 1994 and, with the pace of privatisations likely to remain strong in Europe and the emerging economies, the volume of underwriting outside the US this year should exceed 1993.  ------------------------------------------     VOLUME OF US STOCK AND BOND ISSUES  ------------------------------------------                            Proceeds Year                     (Dollars bn)  ------------------------------------------ 1987                         277 1988                         279 1989                         310 1990                         314 1991                         590 1992                         857 1993                       1,063  ------------------------------------------ Source: Securities Data  ------------------------------------------</p>

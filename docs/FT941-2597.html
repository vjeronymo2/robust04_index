			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Markets: Is UB a crumbling cookie? - The Bottom Line For those with a pessimistic turn of mind, Thursday's results from United Biscuits raised a familiar question: Is the company big enough to survive in the changing world of food manufacture? The thesis is straightforward. Food processing is being dominated more and more by a handful of giants such as Nestle or Unilever. They can link their operations across whole continents, and have international brands. They can afford to drive down the cost of production and force up their marketing spending. They can afford to invest across the developing world, where the real growth lies in the next century. In that light, UB's position looks rather shaky. Historically, much its most important market outside Britain has been the US. On Thursday it announced restructuring charges there of more than Pounds 90m. Its US profits are past the worst - but its margins are still half what they were two years ago, and its market share is down. The position is not much brighter at home. UB has a dominant 44 per cent of the UK biscuit market but its profits there fell 10 per cent last year. In snacks, where it is also market leader, profits fell 4 per cent last year. Retreating to the home market, plainly, is not an option. Eric Nicoli, UB's forthright chief executive, will have none of this. First, he argues, the fall in UK profits is not primarily the result of competition. Second, the US subsidiary, Keebler, clearly is recovering. Third, UB's situation outside the UK and US has been transformed in the past four years. These points are worth taking separately. Last year, Nicoli says, UK raw material prices increases were in double figures. The new crop of nuts - in which UB is market leader - was up 50 per cent. With inflation running at around 2 per cent, passing on that kind of increase was not feasible. In any case, he says, the competition is not so much international giants as small domestic operators trying to get bigger. Around Europe, UB is not dominated by big companies. In biscuits, it is number one in the UK, Holland, Denmark, Finland, Hungary and Poland. Europe's biggest biscuit maker, BSN, of France, is No 1 in France and Belgium and, says UB, almost nowhere else. 'Biscuits are BSN's least profitable part and are a low priority for them,' Nicoli says. 'They'll be reluctant to divert funds to duff us up.' As for recovery in the US, it remains to be seen how sustainable it will prove. The restructuring plan has been produced by a new management installed last year. The old team, Nicoli says, had a volume-driven strategy which, although ideal in the 1980s, was quite wrong for the 1990s. Certainly, a recovery in the US is of central importance to the group. It must expand internationally; but, given the pressures in the UK, the domestic business cannot fund such expansion on its own. It is in the international field, though, that Nicoli makes his strongest case. Four years ago, UB had no significant presence outside the UK and US. Last year, continental Europe and the Asia/Pacific region produced 22 per cent of group profits. Since UB cannot afford to match the likes of Nestle in the breadth of its investments, it is focusing on Asia and central Europe. It has 5 per cent of the biscuit market in the Shanghai area. It manufactures in Japan, the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia. As for eastern Europe, its dominance in Hungary and Poland speaks for itself. Nevertheless, it remains worrying that, in all its chief markets, UB is up against companies which, as corporate entities, are several times its size. This could help to explain why UB's shares rose on Thursday in response to a headline fall in profits of 28 per cent. If the company cannot succeed on its own, the assets which it has assembled so painstakingly will be worth a good deal to someone else.</p>

			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Lenders warn on home repossessions THE GOVERNMENT came under further pressure on the economy yesterday as mortgage lenders warned that they were unable to stem the flood of borrowers at risk of having their homes repossessed. In spite of pre-election assurances from Mr John Major, the prime minister, that the repossessions problem was under control, new figures showed that the number of home-owners in serious arrears with mortgage payments rose sharply in the first half of the year. As Labour seized on the findings as fresh evidence of government inaction, Mr Mark Boleat, director-general of the Council of Mortgage Lenders, said it was hard to see what could be done to help the housing market recover while the recession continued. Although the number of homes actually repossessed by lenders fell slightly in the first half of the year, the CML said that 305,140 mortgage accounts - more than 3 per cent of all mortgages  - were more than six months in arrears. This compared with 275,350 at the end of last year. During the first half of the year, 35,750 properties were repossessed by lenders. Although this was 8 per cent down on the second half of last year, it was higher than expected and suggests that the number of homes repossessed this year may be close to last year's total of 75,540. Mr Boleat said that, although it was good news that the repossessions figures were down, the growing level of arrears suggested the position was deteriorating and was beyond the control of mortgage lenders. He denied the government was complacent and said that, without measures agreed between the government and lenders last December to help borrowers in serious arrears, repossessions would have passed 100,000 in the first half. Meanwhile, figures for court orders to repossess properties issued by the Lord Chancellor's Department yesterday confirmed that in the half year there were 68,883 court orders for repossession, up from 65,892 in the corresponding period last year. Mr Nick Raynsford, Labour MP for Greenwich and a former opposition housing spokesman, said that the figures for long-term arrears suggested there might be at least a further 150,000 repossessions over the next two years. His warning was echoed by Mr Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, who demanded measures, including a Pounds 100m subsidy, to encourage mortgage rescue schemes.

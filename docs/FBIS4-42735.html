			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Major Does Not Veto Dehaene"] </F>   [Excerpts] British Prime Minister John Major will not veto  Jean-Luc Dehaene as the successor to Jacques Delors, president  of the European Commission (EC). Major said on BBC television  that such a veto was "risky." The British attitude means that  Lubbers' chances of getting the EC presidency have become  extremely small.    Yesterday, in an unusual declaration, the parliamentary  leaders of the four major Netherlands parties supported outgoing  Prime Minister Lubbers' candidacy for the EC presidency. Kok  (PvdA [Labor Party]), Brinkman (CDA [Christian Democratic  Appeal]), Bolkestein (VVD [People's Party for Freedom and  Democracy]), and Van Mierlo (D66 [Democrats 66]) announced that  they supported Lubbers "with conviction."    The race for the EC presidency is still formally entirely  open, but if the rumors emanating from the European Union [EU]  capitals are true, then a large majority of countries favor  Belgian Prime Minister Dehaene. Lubbers' few remaining chances  depended on Major's support.    In Brussels there was speculation on this possibility. The  threat of a British veto probably could have led to a turnaround  in the considerations of the other EU leaders. Now that Major  is refusing to use such drastic means at the European Council on  Corfu, Lubbers has lost his international supporters.    It had been assumed up to now that London had serious  objections to Dehaene as EC president. But, according to the  FINANCIAL TIMES, the Major government does not view Dehaene as  the great advocate of a European superstate. The Belgian prime  minister has more of a reputation in government circles as a  "political fixer," the Belgians call him "the plumber," rather  than a "European visionary." [passage omitted]    Outgoing Foreign Minister Kooijmans praised the initiative  of  the four parliamentary leaders at a CDA meeting on Monday  evening. He praised Lubbers as the best candidate for Europe  because "extreme adroitness will be required to keep the  countries in the heart and on the edges of Europe together."    "Considering that the Netherlands, which is the only  founding  country of the European Community that has not provided a  president, has put forward such an excellent candidate, can you  tell me what is wrong with this candidate?" Kooijmans asked,  almost desperately. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TONIGHT'S FEATURED GAMES;  </P> <P> FOOTHILL VS. TUSTIN  </P> <P> RECORDS -- Foothill 4-6 (last season), Tustin 1-0.  </P> <P> SITE -- Tustin High School.  </P> <P> FOOTHILL UPDATE -- The Knights have a talented runner in tailback Sean  Saunders, who gained 846 yards last season.  </P> <P> However, for the Knights to be successful in this game and for the season, they  will depend on senior quarterback Evan Lang, who didn't throw a pass last  season. "There's more responsibility on Evan," Coach Marty McWhinney said.  "He's going to have to throw well to keep everybody off Sean. If he doesn't,  Sean will still get his 100 yards, but that's all the offense we'll get." The  Knights will start six juniors on defense. "We are going to be good  defensively," McWhinney said. "But not right away because of our inexperience.  We may be overmatched this game."  </P> <P> TUSTIN UPDATE -- The Tillers are coming off a 37-7 victory over Honolulu Pac-5.  In that game, Tustin showed off its potent offense. Tailback Ron Goods gained  117 yards and fullback Visko Ancich had 90. Quarterback Andy Borza completed  seven of nine passes for 73 yards. Defensively, Tustin is inexperienced up  front. However, that didn't seem to be a problem against Pac-5. The Tillers  have a significant advantage because they have already played a game. KEY TO  THE GAME -- Foothill's defense. It's young and untested and it's going against  what might be the county's best offense.  </P> <P> CONSENSUS -- Tustin has too much going for it. The Tillers have talent, speed  and have played one game. Tustin by at least 10 points.  </P></p>

			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / 'Cover up' claim in Salvation Army row LAWYERS representing Mr Stuart Ford, the Birmingham businessman alleged to be at the centre of the Pounds 6.2m fraud against the Salvation Army, yesterday hit back at allegations that Mr Ford was responsible for the loss of the charity's money. Mr Jim Crocker of the law firm Howell and co said, on behalf of Mr Ford, that the allegations represented a 'cover up' on the charity's part. 'If anybody is guilty of anything then that blame should lie fairly and squarely at the door of the Salvation Army,' Mr Crocker said. The accusations against Mr Ford came in an statement issued by the Salvation Army on Thursday - the first full statement the charity had made since February, when it issued writs accusing Mr Ford, and his business associate Mr Gamil Naguib of conspiring to defraud the charity. Thursday's statement announced that three top Salvation Army officials had been transfered from their posts, and Colonel Grenville Burn, the Salvation Army officer in charge of fundraising, had been sacked. However, General Eva Burrows, the Salvation Army's leader, stressed that on the basis of an internal investigation conducted by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountants, the charity had been innocent victims of skilled fraudsters. Gen Burrows said: 'There is no suspicion of any dishonesty by any of the people who have been disciplined.' This position echoes the preliminary findings of the Metropolitan and City of London Police fraud squad, who have not yet found any evidence implicating senior charity officials in the fraud. At the same time, the Charities Commission has announced an inquiry into the affair. According to the Salvation Army statement, the money was diverted from its accounts when two self-styled business advisers, Mr Stuart Ford, and Mr Gamil Naguib persuaded Col Burn, to transfer Dollars 10m to the Belgium bank ASLK-CGER, in the spring of 1992, supposedly for investment in letters of credit. Although the account was supposed to be under the supervision of top Salvation Army officials, in June 1992 Col Burn and Mr Ford then moved Dollars 8.8m into an account of the Banque Continentale du Luxembourg without proper consultation. By mid-December the charity learned that this money had been diverted by Mr Ford and Mr Naguib into a range of different accounts. Consequently, about Dollars 1m of the missing money has been recovered. Detectives from the Metropolitan and City of London police fraud squad have interviewed Col Burn at length and have had access to affidavits made by other senior officials. They have also studied documentation relating to bank transactions in Belgium and Luxembourg. Mr Ford's lawyers yesterday said that he had voluntarily surrendered himself to the police on Thursday, before the charity issued its statement. He is bailed to appear in court in October.</p>

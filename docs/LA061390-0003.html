			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> $2.3-BILLION TAX INCREASE URGED TO FIGHT STATE DEFICIT  </P> <P> Democratic budget and tax committee chairmen, setting the stage for a showdown  with Gov. George Deukmejian and Republican legislators, unveiled a plan Tuesday  to raise state taxes $2.3 billion annually to head off a potential budget  deficit.  </P> <P> The tax proposals would hit affluent Californians the hardest.  </P> <P> By outlining what would be the largest state tax increase in recent years, the  two committee chairmen were first out of the blocks with a concrete plan to  close a $3.6-billion funding gap.  </P> <P> The proposal follows passage of Proposition 111, the gasoline tax increase  measure approved by voters in the June 5 primary election and seen by many  lawmakers as a signal that Californians are willing to pay more for government  services if a case can be made that the money is necessary.  </P> <P> The new tax plan was proposed by Sen. Alfred E. Alquist (D-San Jose), chairman  of the Senate Budget and Fiscal Review Committee, and Assemblyman Johan Klehs  (D-San Leandro), chairman of the Assembly Revenue and Taxation Committee.  </P> <P> The cornerstone of the plan would raise the top personal income tax bracket  back to 11%. The top bracket was lowered to 9.3% in 1987 as part of a major  restructuring of state tax codes triggered by changes in federal tax law  enacted in 1986.  </P> <P> "It was a mistake. It's time to admit it was a mistake," Klehs said.  </P> <P> Restoring the 11% bracket for single taxpayers with incomes of $100,000 a year  and couples filing joint returns on incomes of $200,000 or higher would  generate $1.1 billion in new tax revenues, Alquist and Klehs said.  </P> <P> Ten other measures in the Democrats' tax package, which include a sales tax on  candy, a new tax on oil and reduction in amounts businesses can write off for  business lunches, would add another $1.2 billion, the lawmakers said.  </P> <P> They said the rest of the $3.6-billion deficit would be closed by reductions in  the size of the proposed budget reserve and a 5.2% across-the-board cut in  various state programs.  </P> <P> Klehs said he and Alquist came up with the plan at the urging of their  Democratic colleagues as an alternative to deep cuts being suggested by  Deukmejian. Those cuts would hit hardest at human services programs providing  aid to welfare recipients, the elderly, the mentally ill and others who benefit  by health and welfare programs.  </P> <P> Klehs said high-income taxpayers, oil companies and corporations that provide  executives with "three-martini lunches" were targeted because they were the  chief beneficiaries of tax changes in 1986 and 1987.  </P> <P> In comments reflecting the spirit of the proposal, Klehs told reporters during  a Capitol news conference: "The state of California should not be subsidizing  their (business) lunch. We should be subsidizing the lunches of poor people,  people who are in need, people who are on limited incomes, and not wealthy  people who simply write it off."  </P> <P> Klehs said the proposal will be amended into a bill carried by Alquist and will  be heard first in the Senate.  </P> <P> Indicating that it will face rough going, Assemblyman William P. Baker  (R-Danville), vice chairman of the Assembly Ways and Means Committee, said:  "The governor and Republicans are adamantly opposed to any new tax increases,  and I don't expect to see any in the (budget balancing) package. . . . I don't  think soaking the few is going to balance the state budget."  </P> <P> Baker said Republican consensus was forming around the idea that the budget  problem can be solved through budget cuts. Republicans contend that the problem  stems from the fact that, while state revenues are growing by a relatively  healthy 7%, various legally required health and welfare entitlement programs  and other costs are driving up expenditures at an annual rate of 11%.  </P> <P> "We are going to reduce our spending back to the 6% or 7% level that we can  afford. It is going to be painful, but we are going to do it," Baker said.  </P> <P> Drafts of a new state budget in the Assembly and Senate put the spending and  taxing package in the $56-billion range, but they are badly out of balance,  containing far more in proposed services and programs than the state can afford  under the current tax structure. Similarly, the $53-billion budget proposal  being pushed by Deukmejian works only if Democrats agree to make up nearly all  of the $3.6-billion shortfall through budget cuts.  </P> <P> So far, the governor and top legislative leaders have indicated a willingness  to talk about tax increases but have shied away from suggesting or endorsing  concrete proposals.  </P> <P> However, Deukmejian has indicated he is opposed to the kind of proposal  outlined by Klehs and Alquist. Michael R. Frost, Deukmejian chief of staff,  said the governor believes a large tax increase, without changing laws that are  driving up costs at an 11% annual rate, would be like "pouring gasoline on a  fire."  </P> <P> Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) was noncommittal when  questioned about the Klehs-Alquist proposal. "I don't know where it will go,  but it's certainly worthy of dialogue," he said.  </P> <P> Klehs said Republican criticism of his plan reflects a desire by GOP lawmakers  "to find $2.8 billion in revenue without pain. I don't think the enormity of  the problem has even begun to set in with the governor and Republican  legislators."  </P></p>

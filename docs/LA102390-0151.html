Repertory Theatre of Tustin to stage "The Mystery of  the Missing Heiress," a show that commences in a San Juan Capistrano restaurant  and travels by Amtrak to Del Mar.  </P> <P> Spokeswoman Susan King said the eight-hour production, which is based on an  original script, involves several actors who lead the audience from clue to  clue until the mystery is solved.  </P> <P> The "Missing Heiress" is to premiere Saturday and will continue every Saturday  for an indefinite period. Tickets are $109, an "introductory price" good  through Nov. 17, King said. The price includes a champagne breakfast in San  Juan Capistrano, hors d'oeuvres on the train, an early dinner in a Del Mar  restaurant and a "twilight meal" on the return trip.  </P> <P> Performances of the "Missing Heiress," to be directed by Bill Durkin, will  begin at 10:30 a.m. in San Juan Capistrano during breakfast. Participants then  board the 12:06 p.m. train to Del Mar and will be led through shops there as  part of the production. After dinner, they return to San Juan Capistrano on the  5:30 p.m. train. Package deals for an overnight stay in Del Mar are available,  Durkin said. Information: (714) 835-9611. JAN HERMAN  </P></p>

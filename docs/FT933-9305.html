			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchanges: D-Mark triumphs again Several European currencies were again humbled by the D-Mark yesterday as the German currency continued its recent rise, writes Stephanie Flanders. Almost all the European currencies lost ground against the D-Mark, but the French franc and the Irish punt were in the spotlight, losing two and five pfennigs respectively against the D-Mark in morning trading. During the afternoon, however, the French currency recovered to close at FFr3.521 compared to Monday's London close of FFr3.507. The Irish unit was less fortunate and was still floundering at the close of trade. The immediate trigger for the D-Mark's losses was the Bundesbank's morning signal that it would not allow short-term German interest rates to fall lower in the near future. But analysts said that traders were being driven by the same reasoning as before. 'There's now an established tendency to lean on several of the ERM currencies,' said Mr Michael Burke, economist at Citibank in London. 'The market is getting the bit between its teeth: in the absence of a significant loosening in countries like France and Belgium, the markets intend to achieve the same thing through pushing down the currency instead.' Several observers commented that trading volumes had picked up somewhat during Monday and Tuesday, although few thought that there would be a dramatic flight from a single currency. Steady pressure on almost all the non-German ERM countries was more likely, they said. In line with this view, the Danish Krone and Belgian franc also weakened significantly, closing lower against the D-Mark. The Portuguese and Spanish currencies fared better, but closed down on the day nevertheless. Many were surprised to see the Irish currency come under such pressure, given its recent high standing within the ERM grid. Yesterday's fall was said to be partly a knock-on effect from sterling's weakness, as well as the same market desire for a depreciation affecting the continental European currencies. 'If anything, the Irish are the ones in the ERM with the best arguments for a strong currency,' said one analyst. 'If the Irish Central Bank has not been intervening to support the punt or making these arguments, it must be because they've learned from the French experience that it's a hopeless fight.' Sterling and the dollar were both also frail yesterday, although on the cross the US currency had the upper hand, closing at DM1.710. The pound slid to DM2.5275 on the London exchanges. This was  3/4 of a pfennig lower than the previous day's close. But dealers said it would soon form a base and that yesterday's weakness was simply the result of the strong D-Mark.</p>

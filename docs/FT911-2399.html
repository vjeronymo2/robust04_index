			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Labour intends to scrap A-levels A-LEVEL examinations would be abolished under plans by the Labour party to overhaul educational qualifications for students aged 16 to 19 in England and Wales, the party announced yesterday. Labour would create a single post-16 qualification for both academic and vocational studies, to be called the Advanced Certificate for Education and Training (ACET). The aim is that the ACET should eventually subsume A-levels, Business and Technician Education Council (Btec) exams, and many other vocational qualifications. The ACET is a modular-based concept. Under Labour's plan, students would have to complete some five 'modules' to qualify. Modules either academic or vocational in their broad scope would be available with a range of 'core skills' common to both. Mr Jack Straw, shadow education secretary, said in launching the proposals: 'It is now a national imperative that we end the present jungle of over 200 qualifications and replace it with a single coherent framework of 16-19 qualifications combining the academic and the vocational.' No timetable for full introduction of the ACET has been set by Labour. For an interim period, however, a five-subject A-level would be introduced. 'This will be welcomed by colleges and universities, and will entail no reduction in standards', Mr Straw insisted. Labour's scheme would comprise: The ACET qualification for pupils over the age of 16. A new qualifications board to ratify modular courses to be offered as part of the ACET. It would replace the National Council for Vocational Qualifications and the Schools Examination and Assessment Council. A system of transferable credits that trainees would be able to devote towards an ACET. An obligation on employers of people aged 16 to 19 to provide approved training or day release. Mr Tony Blair, Labour's employment spokesman, described the proposals as 'a long overdue departure from the present system, which has divided education and training in both standards and status.' The government has yet to announce its plans for the future of post-16 qualifications, but ministers are unlikely to favour significant changes to the A-level. Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, immediately condemned Labour's plans as a threat to standards. 'He proposes that everyone should get more A-levels by making them easier to get . . . There are more sensible ways of broadening education for 16-to-19-year-olds which we will be publishing shortly.' Mr Matthew Taylor, the Liberal Democrat education spokesman, accused Labour of adopting his party's proposals.</p>

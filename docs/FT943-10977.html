			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Currencies Yesterday's renewed fall of the dollar against the yen was a curious, if predictable response to the US decision to starting the clock ticking on Japanese trade sanctions. Since Japan's trade surplus has been one of the main props for the yen it seems odd that attempts to hack away at this support should lead to a relapse in the dollar. It is doubly perverse if the US move means it has given up hope that the pressure of a strong yen would be enough to soften Tokyo's position. The markets are clearly unconvinced by recent US declarations of support for the dollar. Since these represent an abrupt about-turn from the previous policy of benign neglect, some scepticism is understandable. Yet the dollar's Y1 fall to around Y99 was relatively modest and the rate remains comfortably above July's low of Y96.6. Perhaps the markets saw the US move as more a matter of momentum rather than a deliberate escalation. The dollar bulls see the muted reaction as evidence that the tide is finally turning. Relative inflation rates apart, the winds are starting to blow the dollar's way. The trade deficit with Japan is already moderating, if only in yen terms. Even without sanctions the changing pace of the two economies should ensure the process continues. US interest rates are rising and, at the current exchange rate, dollar assets should look cheap to Japanese investors. But there is little sign of the capital outflows from the US ebbing. Potential Japanese purchasers of Treasury bonds are still nervous about the currency risk and remain to be convinced that the yen's rise has been halted. When that point comes the dollar should spring to life.</p>

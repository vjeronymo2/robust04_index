			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Insurance stake placed COMPOSITE insurance group Sun Alliance, took full advantage of the recent upsurge in market sentiment and turnover to sell the majority of its holding in fellow-composite Commercial Union (CU). In a 'bought deal' operation Sun sold a block of 60m shares to Smith New Court, the securities house, which, acting in conjunction with Cazenove, the agency broker, placed the shares with a number of institutions. The placing was completed in a matter of minutes, according the dealers. Sun confirmed it had sold the CU stock at 470p a share. Smith New Court and Cazenove placed the shares at 475p a share, indicating that the two broking houses made a Pounds 3m profit of the deal, probably split fifty-fifty. It is thought that Sun Alliance attempted to sell its CU shares earlier this week but that word of the deal leaked into the market, triggering a big slide in the CU share price as marketmakers sought to head off any sizeable selling of the stock. Sun Alliance acquired a 13 per cent stake in CU in August 1989 at 465p from Adelaide Steamship, the Australian investment company then run by Mr John Spalvins who had built up the stake during the previous year. Sun Alliance's stake in CU has long been targeted as one of the few remaining sizeable 'loose' holdings in the UK market. The ease with which the 60m shares were placed ensured that CU were never under any real selling pressure. The stock ended the day unchanged at 489p, having dipped to 480p at worst. Turnover, almost entirely made up of the 60m-share 'bought deal', reached 123m shares. Sun Alliance closed 10 higher at 273p with a hefty 20m shares traded. BAe raided British Aerospace (BAe) appeared to become the victim of a bear raid and the shares took a dive shortly before the market close to make it the worst performing FT-SE stock in the percentage terms. The story doing the rounds late yesterday was that the much predicted deal with Taiwan Aerospace on BAe's regional aircraft division had fallen through. This, so the argument went, would mean BAe will have to close the division forcing the company to make large provisions. Analysts however remained sceptical about the validity of the story. There was also talk that the company could announce losses when it reports interim figures next Wednesday. Many analysts are already predicting a dividend cut when the results are announced. The shares which yesterday enjoyed their last day as a FT-SE constituent had slowly crept forward, though underperforming the market for most of the session before the bear stories led to a reversal in the direction of the shares. They ended 10 lower at 189p on turnover of around 2m shares. Guinness disappoints The disappointing interim results from Guinness that were reported on Thursday, finally took their toll yesterday sending the shares tumbling against the strong market trend, as investors were advised to switch out of the stock. Explaining the retreat Ms Michelle Proud at County NatWest said, 'people are looking at the stock and saying there is no growth this year, and the stock is at a considerable premium to similar stocks in the sector.' The shares closed 11 down at 523p, with a majority of the day's trading involving switching out of Guinness and into Allied Lyons which jumped 39 to 623p. Turnover in Guiness was again heavy and reached 8.6m. Also wanted was Grand Metropolitan in which shares jumped 22 to 454p, in busy trade of 8.4m. The oils remained in the forefront of the market's advance, amid another burst of buying interest prompted by the big impact on sterling oil prices of the pound/dollar rate. BP delivered another disappointing performance, the shares managing only a minor gain, closing 2 1/2 up at 214 1/2 p on big turnover of 26m. Dealers said there had been no let up in the steady stream of selling orders from domestic institutions which outstripped persistent US buying. Shell, meanwhile ran up 9 more to 531p on 13m traded with the market pleased with the proposed deal between Shell Chemicals and Montedison. Lasmo edged up 1 1/2 to 147 1/2 p after big two-way trading. Mr Alan Sinclair, oil analyst at Smith New Court, said the market had been 'erroneously concerned about Lasmo's dividend paying ability; if there were doubts about the dividend with oil at Pounds 10 a barrel it's inconceivable they remain with oil now at Pounds 12 a barrel; with Enterprise at this level, Lasmo should be 200p a share.' Burmah Castrol's big overseas earnings helped the shares jump a further 40 to 653p. Hints that a series of hefty profits upgrades are being prepared by many of the market's leading analysts saw the big internationals and pharmaceuticals stocks extend the impressive performances that have followed the effective devaluation of sterling. Glaxo rose 28 to 841p, SmithKline Beecham 13 1/2 to 554 1/2 p and Wellcome 36 to 933p. ICI put on 32 to 1137p and Reuters 32 to 1127p. The prospect of a reduction in UK interest rates rather than the 15 per cent crisis level reached earlier in the week continued to drive the banks higher although there was consternation around the market at the slide in NatWest. The shares dropped 11, or just over 3 per cent, to 346p. The sudden burst of big buying interest in the equity market, which brought with it hopes of a steep increase in corporate activity as the UK economy picks up, saw the merchant banks strongly supported. SG Warburg climbed 29 to 475p, Hambros added 22 to 236p and Kleinwort Benson rose 20 to 261p. Another scintillating showing by UK markets gave a significant boost to the insurance companies solvency margins, and were reflected by big gains in share price. Lifes were equally in demand with Legal &amp; General, also helped by the excellent interim figures, up 29 to 352p. Shares in Thorn EMI moved 27 ahead to 720p boosted by recommendations from several brokers. BZW yesterday turned buyers of the stock and upgraded its year end profits forecast. After a meeting with the company, analysts at the securities house came away less pessimistic about the interim figures expected in November, citing a better than expected performance of the music division. They now expect interim profits to remain around Pounds 95m. BZW however upgraded the full year figure by Pounds 10m to Pounds 330m to take account of the benefits of integrating recent purchase Virgin Music into the company. County NatWest were also recommending thestock. The reduced value of sterling continued to power Forte and the shares added another 22 to 161p. Turnover was a hefty 10m shares. Food retailers were in demand yesterday. Argyll, gained 18 to 325p, following a positive meeting with analysts. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (75).

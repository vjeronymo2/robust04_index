			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> YANKEES SOLVE LANGSTON, 5-2;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: AFTER BEATING NEW YORK LAST SUNDAY, ANGEL PITCHER HAS CONTROL  TROUBLE. RADER SAYS HIS TEAM HAS NO EXCUSE FOR LOSS.  </P> <P> If he was tired, it was born of frustration, not fatigue.  </P> <P> Doug Rader was tired of seeing his team unable to muster much of an offense,  and he wouldn't accept the obvious excuse that the Angels might have been  exhausted after a 13-game trip and unable to do better than five hits against  the New York Yankees on Friday night.  </P> <P> The Angels been running on near-empty offensively all season, and their 5-2  loss to the Yankees emphasized how low their fuel level is.  </P> <P> "I won't accept (fatigue). If you're tired, you suck it up," Rader said after  the Angels' sixth loss in their last nine games and 11th in their last 16. "You  have no right to be fatigued. Possibly mentally fatigued, but physically  fatigued, not these people here. I doubt that very few of these people here  have been physically fatigued. Sometimes you might think you are, but you never  are."  </P> <P> They had to be tired of having little to show for their at-bats against Dave  LaPoint (2-2), who last Sunday lasted only two innings against the Angels,  giving up four runs (one earned).  </P> <P> This time, after Luis Polonia tripled to lead off the first inning and scored  on Devon White's sacrifice fly, the Angels had only two more hits off LaPoint  in five innings and only one more run against the Yankees, who had lost their  previous five games.  </P> <P> "If everybody did what Luis Polonia did," Rader said, "we would have scored  nine runs and won."  </P> <P> They scored one more, when Chili Davis walked and Dante Bichette doubled in the  ninth off Dave Righetti, the fourth New York pitcher. By then, they had  squandered a bases-loaded, two-out chance in the fourth, leaving them one for  10 in bases-loaded situations this season, and the Yankees had benefited from  Jesse Barfield's three-run home run in the sixth off Mark Langston (2-2), who  had earned the victory in that game against the Yankees last Sunday.  </P> <P> "It was the same old David," said Rader, who was a coach with the Chicago White  Sox when LaPoint pitched there. "He changes speeds, turns the ball over and  sinks it. He gives you the opportunity to get yourself out and that's exactly  what we did for him."  </P> <P> LaPoint was grateful that the Angels accepted his invitation and continually  were retired on groundouts this time.  </P> <P> "It was different last week because I had a passed ball (which set up a  three-run Angel rally in the second inning) and I instantly went and tried to  make too perfect pitches and they were taking them," LaPoint said. "This time,  I relaxed and threw my pitches.  </P> <P> "Doug knows me. He's seen my stuff. He knows if he's got a chance to bury me,  he has to. My job is to just keep the game close."  </P> <P> Langston, who went eight innings, was bent on the same mission but could not  accomplish it. The two second-inning walks he issued were an indication that he  was in for some problems, and he gave up a run in the third on a walk, a stolen  base and a run-scoring single by Don Mattingly, one of the few left-handed  hitters who owns a good (.289) career average against him.  </P> <P> "If you flirt with danger as much as he was, one bad pitch is going to happen,"  Rader said. "That's not to belittle him, but when you're that wild and not able  to control your pitches any better than that, problems are almost inevitable.  You can't avoid danger if you put yourself in that position over and over  again."  </P> <P> The Yankees chipped away for another run in the fifth, using a walk, a stolen  base and a run-scoring single by Roberto Kelly. Then they pulled away in the  sixth. With one out, Langston hit Steve Balboni and then gave up a single to  Dave Winfield. Barfield's home run to right-center came on a fastball down and  away, and it left the Angels too far down to recover.  </P> <P> "I wasn't getting my fastball over and that's the big key for me," said  Langston, who had not given up more than four earned runs in any of his  previous four starts this season. "I felt pretty lucky, considering how wild I  was in the first couple innings. I never really got into a groove until after  the damage was done and then I settled down and got ahead of the hitters. It  was too late by then.  </P> <P> "I felt rested. That wasn't the problem. It was location."  </P> <P> He might have been assuming too much blame. Given the Angels' .233 team  average, they are not likely to overcome many deficits.  </P> <P> Or build many leads.  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> Reggie Jackson, now a TV commentator on Channel 5, gave Yankee outfielder Dave  Winfield a hard time while the Yankees were doing their pregame stretching. "So  you're a part-timer now," Jackson began, as Winfield, who missed the 1989  season after undergoing back surgery, did his calisthenics. "You know what  happens when they make you the DH. That's how they ran me out of baseball. . .  . Don't leave anything on the warning track tonight because you know what  people are going to say. They're going to say, 'Years ago, that would have gone  out.' " The other Yankees smiled, giving Jackson more fuel. "The guys that are  laughing the hardest are thinking the same thing," Jackson said. "Oh, and you  know I need you for an interview?" Jackson's jesting may have inspired  Winfield. He ended a career-worst 0-for-23 streak in the fourth with a single.  </P> <P> To the delight of Angel newcomer Luis Polonia, Donnie Hill gave Polonia uniform  No. 22 -- which means Polonia can keep the ornate gold "22" charm he wears  around his neck instead of selling it to Hill. "I figured I'd have to change my  whole wardrobe if he gave it to me," said Hill, who took 18. Polonia was even  more delighted to be in the starting lineup Friday against a left-hander. "It's  great. That's telling me I don't have to think about whether I'm playing or  not," he said. "That was the tough thing for me -- I'd be home and then come to  the game and see I'm not in the lineup. Now I don't have to think about it or  read the paper to see who's pitching. I'm going to be there and I'm going to do  my job day by day."  </P> <P> Mark Langston and his wife, Michelle, will provide the voices for two  characters in an animated action-adventure TV series, "Captain Planet and the  Planeteers."  </P></p>

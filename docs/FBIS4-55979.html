			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim </F> Rugova by Dorrit Saietz; place and date not given]    [Text] Denmark is currently being visited by a president  without a country. Literature Professor Ibrahim Rugova is the  popularly elected leader of 2 million Kosovo Albanians. But the  Serbian Government in Belgrade refuses to recognize his and his  countrymen's desire for independence. The tense situation in  Kosovo has not yet erupted into open war. This is due in no  small measure to President Rugova's and his supporters'  insistence on nonviolent resistance.    "If war broke out in Kosovo it would be a catastrophe for  us.  It would be much worse than in Croatia or Bosnia. We have no  police, no military forces, no means of defending ourselves,"  Ibrahim Rugova said in an interview with DET FRI AKTUELT. The  Serbian authorities have been consistent in closing or taking  over Albanian institutions, and ethnic Albanians have been fired  from their posts in public administration. The Serbs amount to  only 10 percent of the population in Kosovo, but today they  dominate the apparatus of power. Nevertheless, up to now the  resistance to the Serbs has been peaceful.    "The Albanian population follows the policy of nonviolence,  even though this is not easy when every day you are mistreated,  persecuted, and purged." How does one behave as president when  one's state and government are not recognized?    "It is difficult, of course. But it is we who have the  morale and the political organization, while the Serbs only have  their military power. That is the difference between them and  us. I am president because I agree with my people," Rugova  said, explaining how the parliament, which after two years has  still not been able to meet, and the government nevertheless are  able to function.    "The parliament works with different groups and commissions  and with the four parties that are represented. We also have a  government, part of which is abroad and part in Kosovo itself.  We have ministers for education, health, information, and so on.    ``We have also organized a system of solidarity which makes  sure that money, food, and foodstuffs are distributed to those  who are in need."    All this works in parallel with the Serbian government  machinery.    Is there a solution to the whole of the Yugoslav conflict?    "What is important in Bosnia is first and foremost to stop  the war. And then it is also a question of whether or not  Bosnia can survive as a state. If the Serbs get their way in  Bosnia they are bound to become even more aggressive. If the  Serbs are not halted there they will go further in Kosovo and  Macedonia."    The Kosovo Albanians want an independent, neutral state  between Serbia and Albania. Deep down they dream about becoming  a part of Albania, Ibrahim Rugova admitted. But they know very  well that this is politically unrealistic. What many Western  observers fear is that the Kosovo Albanians' call for  independence will have a contagious effect on the situation in  Macedonia where there is another large Albanian minority. This  would cause further irritation in Greece and the scene would  then be set for a large-scale war in the Balkans which would  make the present conflict look like a tea party.    Ibrahim Rugova is aware of and fears this risk. But how much  longer can the Kosovo Albanians' patience last?    "I do not know. It does not depend on us Albanians alone.  It could happen that some sudden provocation could come from  the Serbs. Perhaps they might start doing something in a small  way, but in the end everything would just become too much," he  said.    In Denmark Ibrahim Rugova has been received at prime  minister  level and has met Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen (Social  Democratic Party) and Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen  (Radical Liberal Party). "We have met with an understanding of  Kosovo's situation. We asked that Denmark, through the EU  [European Union], should apply pressure so that something is  done that can prevent a conflict from flaring up. A year ago  the CSCE mission in Kosovo was expelled. Since then they have  been working to return, but have not been given permission. It  is the Serbs who have the power and control everything.    Rugova wants Kosovo to be placed under international  surveillance by the United Nations or the EU.    "We have also asked for Kosovo to be included as part of the  global problems which have to be solved in the former  Yugoslavia. We demand the right to self-determination. And that  the way of peace which the Albanians have chosen will become  recognized by the international community."</p>

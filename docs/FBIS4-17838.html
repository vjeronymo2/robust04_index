			<p>BFN     [Text] Communist party chief in Lvov Aleksandr Golub says  Ukrainian communists will throw their weight behind any  left-wing candidate for the presidency who will agree to become  the country's last president.    In an interview with Interfax-Ukraine, he said the  institution of presidency for Ukraine was both alien and  ineffective because of historical traditions and polarization  between the eastern and western parts of the country.    He said the communist party had won more than ten million  votes in the recent elections, an indication that "the left-wing  forces are back in the country's political life for good." At  the same time, Golub said the left groups which had not counted  on winning a third of parliamentary seats were seeing their  success as a sign of credibility on the ground.    Communist deputies will be working hard to try to stabilize  the economy and carry out tax and price reforms, he said.    Golub blamed the country's economic and cultural setbacks on  policies carried out by the regime of President Kravchuk propped  up by nationalist-minded democrats and aimed to build up a  capitalist society run by bureaucrats and criminal circles.    He described the new parliament as a body of seasoned  technocrats and politicians rather than that of saviours of the  nation or backyard prophets.</p>

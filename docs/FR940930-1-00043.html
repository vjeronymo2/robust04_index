			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Recommendations to narrow the terms for replacement used in the proposed rule by substituting the term ``line section'' came from comments to the proposed rule filed by a pipeline trade association and a pipeline operator. These two commenters favored the term because it was already defined in 49 CFR 195.2 and it clearly set out the length to be made to accommodate smart pigs. Other commenters suggested similar terms such as ``replacement transmission section'' (recommended by AGA), ``segment'', and ``line segment''. However, none of these terms was as clearly defined as ``line section'', and RSPA, on the basis of the comments, chose to adopt the more recognized term to clarify the intent of the rule. This solution to the concerns raised by the commenters is clearly within the scope of the broadly worded proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, RSPA provided an opportunity for meaningful comment, consistent with the APA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Advisory Committee Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Both petitioners complain that there was no opportunity for consideration by the Technical Pipeline Safety Standards Committee (TPSSC) of the requirement to modify replacement line sections to accommodate smart pigs because line section was not mentioned in the notice or in the summary of comments that was prepared by RSPA for the August 3, 1993 TPSSC meeting. Consistent with 49 U.S.C. 60115, RSPA presented the published Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to the TPSSC. In addition, RSPA passed out a draft summary of the comments. The TPSSC accepted the proposed rule as reasonable, feasible and practicable provided several changes were incorporated. Since the TPSSC reviews and advises on the proposed rule, it is understandable that the final rule may differ from the proposal considered or accepted by that committee. In this case, the final rule was drafted and published some eight months later. Although RSPA is required to consider the TPSSC's advice (but is not obligated to adopt any of the TPSSC's recommendations), several issues raised by the TPSSC were incorporated in the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, RSPA considered the TPSSC recommendations in an appropriate manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Economic Impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Both INGAA and AGA claim that RSPA failed to consider adequately the economic impact of the replacement aspect of the final rule. However, many of the changes RSPA incorporated into the final rule were done at least in part because of economic arguments advanced by commenters. For example, based on INGAA's and AGA's comments to the NPRM, RSPA incorporated the procedure to address unforeseen contingencies in replacements (&sect;192.150(c)); a clear exception for gas gathering lines (&sect;192.9); an exception for pipelines located in storage fields because of the small diameter piping configured in a grid-like pattern (&sect;192.150(b)(3)); and an exception for transmission pipelines within a distribution system (&sect;192.150(b)(6)). In addition, the definition of ``line section'' was developed in part to address AGA concerns that ``pigging'' a short segment is not economically feasible and that the proposed rule could be read to require modification of the entire transmission line. Each of these incorporated changes reduced the economic impact of the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> INGAA points to the costs of obtaining needed approvals for replacement projects from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), Federal and state environmental and archaeological agencies, and property owners. INGAA claims that some of these may take a year or more to obtain. To the extent that approvals are needed before work on the line can be done, the final rule provides for delays. In response to INGAA and AGA comments, &sect;192.150(c) sets out a procedure to allow an operator to delay required modifications to the line section for up to one year should situations such as delays in needed approvals occur. However, many replacements will not require approvals. For example, FERC regulation 18 CFR &sect;2.55 does not require prior approval whenever the replacement is less than $6.6 million (1994 limit) and does not reduce service or change the capacity of the line. Certainly the replacement of certain obstructions such as reduced port valves and short radius bends will fall into this category and not require any approval from FERC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

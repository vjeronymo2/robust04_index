			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Sea captain who perverted Utopia: Dan Gawthrop tells one of the century's strangest tales of religious humbug IN SEVEN explosive years, 20,000 followers worldwide contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to support the Aquarian Foundation - a utopian, pre-60s spiritual colony which was ultimately destroyed by the deceit, black magic and slave labour imposed by its founding visionary. The story of this 'false prophet', Edward Arthur Wilson, a former English sea captain who changed his name to Brother Twelve after a vision in the south of France, is told in a fascinating biography by Canadian author John Oliphant. Wilson's experience was later referred to in newspapers as the most amazing story ever told in a Canadian court. As Oliphant reveals, Wilson, who was nearly penniless and in poor health when he had his first 'vision' in 1924, seemed an unlikely candidate to lead multitudes. Born in Ladywood, Birmingham in 1878, Wilson was raised by his craftsman father as an 'Irvingite' - an obscure sect of the Catholic Apostolic Church which singled out the Book of Revelations as the most important scripture, interpreted numerical symbols in the Bible, 'and believed that the archangels, seraphim and cherubim, were living spiritual beings.' Oliphant describes Wilson as a restless young adult who worked various jobs as a seaman and got married in New Zealand before abandoning his wife and two children in Victoria, British Columbia. He served as a navigator in the First World War, sailed around the world and studied the ancient religions of Egypt, India, China and Mexico. In addition to writing several scholarly texts on astrology, and joining the American Theosophical Society, his social circle in England was said to include Neville Chamberlain, the British Conservative statesman, Jan Smuts, the Boer War general and Sir Arthur Eddington, a distinguished astro-physicist. The 'voice' Wilson heard in his vision said he had been an ancient Egyptian ruler and that his current mission was to 'rebuild' and 'restore' the human race. Dubbing himself 'Brother Twelve' - after his Master, the Twelfth Brother in the Great White Lodge - he began writing a series of theosophical texts which were remarkable for their sweeping, apocalyptic prophecy. His vision of Europe on the brink of destruction, outlined in a 1926 article in the Occult Review, sparked a debate on spiritualism with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. He also predicted a major stock market crash within four months of the actual event. By this time, however, Wilson had already formed the Aquarian Foundation and moved to Vancouver Island. Only a handful of people joined him at the time, but Mary Connally - a rich American widow who learned of Brother Twelve after reading a copy of Foundation Letters and Teachings - gave Wilson an initial donation of Dollars 2,000. She then met him in a Toronto hotel room where, after a three-hour discussion, she signed a cheque for Dollars 23,000. Eventually she moved to the settlement on Decourcy Island. ect, with communal living arrangements and daily spiritual gatherings, the foundation soon became a fortress in which colony members stockpiled food to prepare for the Apocalypse and armed themselves with rifles to ward off unseen enemies and unwanted provincial authorities. The project was doomed from the start. Many disciples were surprised to learn that their spiritual leader was a virulent anti-Semite, whose belief in the worldwide banking conspiracy led him to endorse a Ku Klux Klan sympathiser as a third party candidate in the 1928 US presidential election. In one of his more startling discoveries, Oliphant reveals that Brother Twelve's efforts on behalf of Alabama Senator James 'Tom Tom' Heflin were based on his fear that a civil war would result if Heflin's Catholic opponent were elected. Brother Twelve was a notorious womaniser. He often used spiritual justification for his dalliances, including the claim that one Myrtle Baumgartner - whom he seduced on a train journey to Chicago - had returned as Isis to couple with his Osiris. The most notorious affair was with Mabel Skottowe: referred to by disciples as 'Madame Zee,' Brother Twelve's chief mistress was a powerful figure who used a rider's crop to intimidate residents and cast spells on any woman she suspected of trying to steal the affections of Wilson. Even the 67-year-old aristocrat, Mary Connally, was reduced to humiliating labour conditions and forced to spend the winter in a dilapidated shack with loose floorboards and no heating. The abuse Connally was willing to endure until her final breakdown is astonishing, given that the elderly widow had travelled across the continent from North Carolina to testify on Wilson's behalf, in an earlier lawsuit where Wilson was accused of misappropriating her money. That case fell apart when a key witness for the disciples, Robert England, mysteriously disappeared after resigning from the Foundation. By the time the colony finally collapsed in the summer of 1932, foundation members launched a second series of court actions against Brother Twelve. Testimony included allegations of death threats, spellcasting and a plot to assassinate a member of the provincial cabinet who had earlier been asked to intervene. The foundation members won the second case, but their money was never recovered. Following the first court action, Brother Twelve had converted the cash into gold nuggets and had his disciples bury it on the island. By the time authorities were able to excavate the area, all they found in one hole was an empty box containing the note: 'For fools and traitors - nothing]' By that time, Brother Twelve and Madame Zee had fled the country. Wilson was reported to have died in Switzerland in 1934. Oliphant, a Vancouver resident, confesses to a life-long interest in Brother Twelve. He learned of the legend when he sailed through the Gulf Islands as a child, and his interest was sparked further when he read a pulp novel on the subject in the 1970s. His book is the result of 10 years of research in which he acquired court documents and previously unreleased letters. Before Oliphant's book, Wilson's life was shrouded in mystery. Many surviving members of the Aquarian Foundation remained loyal to the principles of theosophy, and were not eager to contribute to sensational accounts of Brother Twelve which would distort the message of the Work. Thus, it was only his extensive reading of Wilson's books and sympathetic view of his theosopical teachings that won Oliphant access to some of the key players. In addition to surviving members of the Aquarian Foundation, original testimony includes a statement by the son of Brother Twelve's lawyer, who recalls a mysterious meeting in San Francisco between his father and a man of Wilson's exact description, following his reported death in 1934 ('quite pale-dressed in white and had a white wide-brimmed hat. I was particularly struck by his eyes'). Oliphant even located Wilson 's daughter, Margery Ellen Bell, who last saw her father when she was an eight-year-old in 1912. What could have attracted so many people to Wilson's bizarre cult? When asked to explain Brother Twelve's enduring intrigue, the author's response is reminiscent of a 1960s credo. 'In the Age of Aquarius,' he says in an interview, paraphrasing Brother Twelve, 'people will recognise the inherent divinity of nature, and that we're all one and should co-operate rather than compete with each other - our welfare is enhanced by that co-operation.' That Wilson's legacy and life were so tragically contrary to this ideal is the greatest paradox of this biography. Brother Twelve, by John Oliphant, was published last autumn by McClelland &amp; Stewart and is released in the UK next week. (Sinclair-Stevenson, Pounds 14.95).</p>

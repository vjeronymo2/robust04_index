Party leader James Molyneaux is heading a delegation which  will visit New York and Washington.    The party said there was a particular need to counter  attempts by the republican support group Noraid and other  elements to undermine business and industrial interest in  Northern Ireland.    A statement from the party said a series of routine visits  by  senior party members had helped to "offset the problems being  caused by a small but vociferous minority within the  Irish-American community."    Fermanagh-South Tyrone MP Mr Ken Maginnis, Euro MP Mr Jim  Nicholson and party secretary Jeffrey Donaldson leave with Mr  Molyneaux on April 16.    Last month Mr Molyneaux refused to accept an invitation to  address a New York conference attended by the Sinn Fein  president Gerry Adams.    The party statement added: "Mr Molyneaux believes this is an  appropriate time to reinforce relationships on a broader front  and has been encouraged by the number of invitations to  undertake a more formal visit at this time."</p>

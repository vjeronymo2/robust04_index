			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Drive launched to cut trade deficit in building materials A review designed to reduce the UK's large trade deficit in building materials has been launched by the construction industry and the government. Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, said 'a group of important clients, contractors and producers' working with his department had formed a task force to combat the level of imports. He said: 'The substantial trade deficit in building materials has persisted throughout the recession. It must now be attacked.' The task force, which was formed at the end of last year, has been asked to produce by the autumn a development programme to run for up to 18 months to identify products with the highest import penetration. The task force will then work with the individual industry to try to improve the position, said Mr Gummer. The annual building material trade deficit fell from Pounds 2.56bn to Pounds 1.73bn between 1988 and 1992, and is thought to have declined further last year. Up to half the deficit is in timber, including much hardwood not grown in the UK. There is more concern about imports of manufactured products such as air-conditioning equipment and decorative floor and wall tiles. Imports of such products have remained high even though they could easily be produced in Britain. The issue of building materials imports was highlighted by ministers at the height of construction boom in the late 1980s when even bricks had to be imported to meet domestic shortfalls. Brick manufacturers subsequently invested Pounds 200m to increase capacity only to be overtaken by the recession. This forced them to close works and kilns no longer required because of the sharp fall in construction demand.</p>

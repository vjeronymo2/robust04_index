			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUENA HIGH PROVES SEMI-TOUGH  </P> <P> Buena High's athletic program has enjoyed semi-sweet success in the Southern  Section playoffs this season. In three sports, the Bulldogs have been knocked  out in the semifinals.  </P> <P> In football, Canyon beat Buena, 45-14.  </P> <P> In boys' basketball, Capistrano Valley defeated Buena, 84-71.  </P> <P> And in girls' basketball, Hart upended the Lady Bulldogs, 78-68, in overtime.  </P> <P> Buena, however, has spent more time celebrating than telling sob stories about  what might have been.  </P> <P> All three teams had so many obstacles to overcome that a .500 record would have  been considered a success.  </P> <P> The football team went 2-8 in 1987 and was a perennial doormat in the Channel  League until Rick Scott took over the program this season.  </P> <P> The boys' basketball team lost two all-county players -- Shawn Kirkeby and Mike  Sandoval -- and was picked to finish a distant third in the Channel League.  </P> <P> Buena has had one of the most successful girls' basketball programs in the  Southern Section, but the team lost two starters to season-ending injuries.  </P> <P> "I'm really proud of the job our coaches have done," athletic director and  girls' basketball Coach Joe Vaughan said. "We have a lot of kids that don't  mind working hard and coaches that put the time and effort into developing  winning programs.  </P> <P> "Sure, we're disappointed that we've lost in the semifinals in three sports.  But how many schools have had as much success?"  </P> <P> Buena also reached the playoffs in girls' tennis and boys' and girls' soccer.  </P></p>

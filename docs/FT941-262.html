			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Investment in India (13): Pergau factor could hit jets deal - Defence Purchases The main talking point in the Indian defence establishment is when, if ever, will even the Indian government give the go-ahead for the purchase of Hawk trainer aircraft from British Aerospace. The fact that the acquisition has been at the centre of the defence debate for several years is symptomatic of the slow-down during the past five years which has taken place in the modernisation of India's defence services under pressure from stringent financial contraints. Even the best placed defence analysts and foreign observers are unsure of the progress of protracted negotiations between several ministries on the purchase, although the Cabinet is know to have, on at least one occasion, rejected a proposal. However, it is generally agreed that the fleet of fighter training aircraft is one of several additions urgently needed to strengthen the country's fighting capability. With the purchase of the rival Franco-German Alpha trainer almost out of question, the 66 Hawks would cost Dollars 1.5bn, escalating to an estimated Dollars 2.5bn with the inclusion of spare parts and maintenance back-up. Mr Jasjit Singh, the director of the Institute of Defence Studies and Analyses, has no doubt that the purchase will go ahead but is concerned about the cost of the delay to training. There is a feeling among some observers that the delay has directly contributed to the relatively high loss rate of aircraft on training missions in unsuitable alternative aircraft. The Pergau Dam controversy about the linkage of UK aid to defence contracts in Malaysia is seen in Delhi as adding sensitivity to the Hawk deal. While there is no suggestion of such a link, there is concern that a Dollars 2.5bn defence deal with a British company would, at this time, come under under intense scrutiny in London and Delhi. A Hawk purchase would call for the Indian Government to find funds outside its existing defence budget. The national budget introduced earlier this month allocated Dollars 7.36bn to defence spending which is only slightly ahead of the previous year's figure after taking inflation into account. Defence spending as percentage of GDP has been on a sharp decline since 1985-86 when it reached 4 per cent. Today it is closer to 2.4 per cent, and barring a rapid change in the strategic balance or a rise in domestic unrest, is likely to remain at this level for the next few years at least as the government wrestles to master public spending. All government departments have come under tighter spending controls. However, the dislocation of defence relations with the former Soviet Union in the wake of its break-up coupled with an easing of tension along the Pakistani and Chinese borders have made defence a target for particular constraint. The newly independent states in the former Soviet Union have been demanding hard currency for arms deals, replacing the previous loan and barter arrangements and adding to the budgetary problems. Several defence observers in Delhi noted that in recent months there appeared to have been a strengthening of contacts between India andstates of the former Soviet Union following exchange visits by a number of highly placed officials. Concern is being expressed that the cuts have reached a point where standards are deteriorating and that this decline will accelerate as equipment and hardware ages without the prospect of replacement. Major General D. Banerjee, the deputy director of the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, shares this concern and believes that it is due to insufficient planning for future defence needs. Several diplomatic missions cite the growing acceptance of outdated yet cheap foreign hardware as evidence of a qualitative decline. They also believe that the desire to step up indigenous production, while understandable as a means of developing local industry and self-reliance, will lead in the short term to a lowering of standards. Several local defence companies have been forced to look at alternative sources for sales as government spending falls. Mr RN Sharma, chairman of the state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics which has a long relationship with BAe, said late last year that after the 'changes in the defence aviation scenario world-wide, HAL has planned to launch a major restructuring of its operations to place new emphasis on the civilian aviation market ..' Others have moved computer software operations, using their experience in defence and skilled staff to diversify into civilian markets. Serious delays with several government-funded defence programmes have cast a shadow over the strategy of indigenous development. Last year it was discovered that locally produced Arjun battle tanks, which began testing last year, were unsuitable for hot terrain while there have been long delays with a helicopter project because of design faults. The navy, with the smallest budget, has also been hit. The submarine development programme has run into problems and it is looking at purchasing four replacement, outdated UK Upholder class vessels at what is described as 'fire sale prices'. In addition to the needs in these fields, the Indian defence force's three most important requirements are 155 millimetre self-propelled guns, either an upgrade or a replacement for the ageing MiG-21 aircraft  - which has formed a key element of the airforce's strike power - and the creation of naval service and shipyards. A replacement plan for the MiG-21 has been virtually ruled out as too expensive with the most likely option being a Russian-led upgrading. The involvement of Israel in this plan is believed to be less likely, due in part to political factors. Although all these replacement or renewal plans possess their own element of urgency, negotiations on each of them are well behind those for the Hawk purchase, meaning decisions could be years away. In the words of a seasoned observer of the Indian defence system: 'I don't think people coming to India to do business with the military are going to do much good. However, if they were to want to set up a power plant or communication system the answer could well be 'yes, yes, yes'.'</p>

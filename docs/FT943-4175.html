			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / US upsets Paris with OECD demand The Clinton administration has expressed its firm opposition to Mr Jean-Claude Paye continuing as secretary general of the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development after his term expires at the end of this month. An unusually blunt US statement, sent by the State Department to the Washington embassies of other OECD members this week, has angered the French government, which will seek EU backing for Mr Paye's candidacy at informal meetings of foreign and finance ministers in Germany this weekend. The statement, ruling out Mr Paye's renomination even on a stop-gap basis, reflects increasing impatience at what Washington regards as European foot-dragging over decisions on the OECD job and the future development of the body. The EU ministers will also seek to agree on candidates for the top jobs at Nato, the Western European Union and the World Trade Organisation, the planned successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Mr Willy Claes, the Belgian foreign minister, yesterday won his government's support as candidate for secretary general of Nato, succeeding Mr Manfred Worner, who died last month. Consensus at this weekend's meetings could be hard to achieve if EU governments insist on linkages between the various posts. Some of France's partners fear it may demand that they back Mr Paye for the OECD in return for French support for Mr Renato Ruggiero, an Italian former trade minister, as the EU's candidate for the WTO. French officials were discouraging such speculation last night. OECD ambassadors will again seek to agree on who should fill the post in Paris on Thursday. The other candidates are Mr Don Johnston, a Canadian former politician strongly backed by the US, which argues Mr Paye's 10 years in the job is enough; Lord Lawson, the former UK chancellor of the exchequer; and Mr Lorenz Schomerus, a senior German economics ministry official. Mr Claes is competing for the Nato post against Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the Norwegian foreign affairs minister and UN mediator in former Yugoslavia, and Mr Hans van den Broek, the Dutch EU commissioner responsible for external political affairs. Though Mr Claes won widespread approval for his performance during the Belgian presidency of the EU last year, diplomats in Brussels said yesterday there was behind-the-scenes pressure on Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, to stand. Mr Hurd, however, is said to be reluctant to move. If Mr Claes were to succeed Mr Worner, it would most likely mean the removal of Mr Karel Van Miert, the popular Belgian EU commissioner for competition policy. Because both Mr Claes and Mr Van Miert are members of the Flemish Socialist party, other members of the governing coalition would most likely demand compensation. Belgium is allotted one nomination for the next European Commission, which begins next January. The German government confirmed yesterday that its two candidates to be members of the next European Commission would be Mr Martin Bangemann, the current industry commissioner, who is a member of the minority Free Democratic party in the Bonn coalition, and Mrs Monika Wulf-Mathies, leader of the oTV public sector workers' trade union, nominated by the opposition Social Democrats.</p>

			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HISTORIC BARNS ARE GETTING OVERDUE ATTENTION;  </P> <P> ARCHITECTURAL GEMS OR LOCAL LANDMARKS, RELICS ARE BEING REHABBED ACROSS U.S.  </P> <P> Great barns are an important part of the rural landscape. They are familiar  landmarks that speak of seedtime and harvest, of hay and horses, milk and  memories.  </P> <P> Many barns in the United States represent the building traditions of settlers  from many other parts of the world. Numerous ethnic groups came to be  identified by their distinctive old-country barn types.  </P> <P> In the Midwest, for instance, the English three-bay barns and German  cantilevered barns were until recently viewed as curiosities or relics of a  vanishing era.  </P> <P> Now, through the "Barn Again!" program of the National Trust for Historic  Preservation, barns are getting long overdue attention. Farmers are finding out  how outdated barns can be economically rehabbed and put back to good use.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Architectural Significance "Historic" generally refers to barns more than 50  years old. Many have architectural significance. Some are important local  landmarks or are valued for their contribution to agricultural history or  technology. The National Register of Historic Places lists 2,599 entries  defined as "resources that were historically functional as agricultural  buildings."  </P> <P> Others are appreciated for the visual impact they make and for their  contribution to regional tourism.  </P> <P> "Can you imagine driving through lush farming areas and seeing only low modern  metal barns, and almost no complete homesteads with their original and  distinctive barns?" asks Janis King, a "Barn Again" convert from Knoxville,  Ill.  </P> <P> "Huge numbers of barns, granaries, and other structures -- many of them  historically significant -- were being torn down, victims of obsolescence,  neglect, and a trend to new metal barns," says Mary Humstone, "Barn Again!"  project director and program associate of the National Trust's mountains/plains  regional office in Denver.  </P> <P> "We saw many good barns going to waste on farms and ranches all across the  country," Ms. Humstone reported to the recent annual conference of the National  Trust, held in Cincinnati.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Put Them Into Use  </P> <P> "We figured that as preservationists we had the kind of expertise that could  help save these buildings and put them back into use, thus saving farmers money  and benefiting rural communities as well as the public as a whole."  </P> <P> Some daunting facts were faced. Farming had changed drastically in the last 50  years. A typical farm of 1920 had many buildings: a hog barn, a chicken coop,  small granaries, machine sheds, large barns for livestock and hay. Today, many  farms specialize in one crop or one product, and modern farmers want efficient,  modern buildings. Although barns seem to survive as long as the land is in some  form of agricultural production, there are far fewer farms today than a half  century ago.  </P> <P> "Sweeping technological changes, farm abandonment, climatic conditions, and  urban encroachment threaten rural resources as never before," Humstone points  out, "so we must somehow make preservation easy, understandable, practical, and  cost-effective."  </P> <P> The "Barn Again!" program, she explains, was developed in response to a need  for ideas and technical information for preserving older farm buildings, and  for blending economic development and historic preservation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Worth Preserving  </P> <P> Editors at Successful Farming magazine in Des Moines agreed with the trust that  historic barns could, and should, be adapted for modern agriculture, and that  they were treasures worth preserving. In 1987 a national "Barn Again!"  competition was launched, jointly sponsored by the National Trust and  Successful Farming, with financial support from John Deere &amp; Co. and  Pioneer Hi-Bred International, two major agricultural corporations.  </P> <P> More than 500 farmers from 34 states responded with entries. Their barn  rehabbing projects ranged in cost from $300 to major $100,000 overhauls.  </P> <P> Eighty-five winners were selected on the basis of innovation, practicality,  cost-effectiveness, and good preservation practices. Traditional uses for the  restored barns varied from hay and hogs to grain storage, machinery sheds,  shops, and dairies. Diversified barn-use enterprises included the selling of  Christmas trees, growing mushrooms, housing a farmer's market, and use as a  square dance hall.  </P> <P> Many of the farmers and their families did the work themselves in pay-as-you-go  phases. For instance, Tim and Catherine Broer of Iowa Falls, Iowa, renovated a  1940s-vintage barn for farrowing. Kevin and Anna Heuiser of Sikeston, Mo.,  turned an unused dairy barn into a modern machine shop.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Winners Announced  </P> <P> Tim and Martha Manchester of Lakeview, Ohio, converted a 1908 round barn into a  soybean seed-cleaning and storage facility. And Stewart and Judith Schlafer of  Stockton, Ill., are using a renovated 100-year-old horse barn for dairy cows.  </P> <P> The 85 winners, announced last summer, spent an average of $11,400 on their  rehabs, and each demonstrated that old farm buildings could indeed be adapted  to the needs of modern agriculture. Four demonstration barn projects in various  areas were used to test creative solutions for reuse, and to illustrate  preservation techniques.  </P> <P> Janis and Ted King, who operate a 369-acre grain and livestock farm near  Knoxville, Ill., sought the assistance of the National Trust in making their  enormous 1865 barn a demonstration project for the "Barn Again!" program. With  the help of barn restorer Dave Clolek, as well as the state historic  preservation agency, a barn architect and engineer, the essential renovation  was accomplished for $8,725, plus another $2,500 to wash and paint the barn.  The project included restoring the crumbled foundation, raising the hayloft,  fortifying the flooring and the roof, jacking up the barn, and replacing broken  windows and rotted sills.  </P> <P> Mrs. King notes that the barn has always stood as a landmark in the area.  </P> <P> "During our four-week 'demonstration' period we had over 500 visitors to the  barn from five states," she says. "We still have people driving in off the road  every week just to admire the great restored barn."  </P> <P> The Swobodas -- Irene and Jim -- spent less than $1,000 to restore their  84-year-old barn (also a demonstration project) in Chippewa County, Wis. They  did all the work themselves. They patched the roof with cedar shingles; they  spent $400 on lumber and hardware to build sliding doors, and $250 for paint to  brighten the barn's exterior.  </P></p>

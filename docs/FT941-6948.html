			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Outdoors: Business sense that keeps communities together - Village Shops / Derek Smith tells Clive Fewins how villages can keep their stores Early in 1991 the village shop at Halstock in Dorset closed at short notice. There had been four owners of the business in 10 years and most of the population thought Halstock would swell the ranks of villages which have been losing their shops for good. They had reckoned without the inventiveness of retired farmer Derek Smith. He established that there was the will to retain the shop in the village, formed an association, negotiated the lease of a semi-detached cottage in the centre, and badgered village donors into raising Pounds 15,000 to pay for the conversion of the ground floor and the stock needed to turn the building into a shop. For the first six months the enterprise was run by a volunteer from the village. But for the past two years the business has been run at a profit by tenant Brenda Erscott. Unlike many other attempts to save village shops, the Halstock scheme has been a success. Other rural communities have looked to it as a model venture, and Smith, 62, has found himself touring the country advising would-be saviours of village shops from Devon to Derbyshire. At the beginning of last year he founded ViRSA, the Village Retail Services Association, which he runs with the help of a part-time secretary and a committee of volunteers from a rambling office at his farmhouse near Halstock. 'The reasons for the decline of the village shop are debated endlessly. Out-of-town supermarkets, the internal combustion engine and the uniform business rate are all frequently cited,' Smith said. 'But what I repeatedly say on my travels round the country is that these shops can be saved if communities will get together and act. 'Very often parish councils do not realise what power they have. They are able quite legally to raise up to Pounds 3.50 per household per annum under the council tax rules, but all too often they don't have the drive. They like to avoid local controversy. It's the old thing: in small communities people don't like to make enemies.' Smith pulls no punches when addressing meetings of villagers, usually called when their village shop is about to close. 'The long-term problem I come up against, time and time again, is that of the deeply indebted shopkeeper. My advice to these people is: don't be brave: cut and run. Be frank with your parish council, for they are your best hope of rescue. The council might be prepared to buy a stake in the freehold, or enter into a shared ownership agreement, thus providing a form of subsidy.' The problem all too often, according to Smith, is that village shopkeepers have paid too much for the freehold of their premises and have mortgages they cannot sustain. 'If shopkeepers in shops in small villages with populations of 500 or less had rents or mortgage payments of Pounds 50 a week or less they would usually survive quite comfortably,' he said. 'Sadly rented shops are in a minority. They usually only exist where there is a benevolent landlord.' At Halstock Brenda Erscott pays the Halstock village shop association Pounds 60 a week rent for the shop. The association in turn pays rent to the owner, making a small gain in the process. That gain, plus stock repayments from Erscott and interest on the existing Pounds 8,000 in the association's funds, means that from next month investors in the shop will be able to start to reclaim their loans. Sums paid in by the 60 investors ranged from Pounds 50 to Pounds 1,500. They were given no guarantee of a return on their money. 'The view from the outset was that people should not put up money they could not afford to lose. Although the payments were interest-free loans there was always a good chance of recouping 50 per cent of the money even if the business closed and the stock and fittings had to be sold off,' Smith said. The shop's turnover last year was Pounds 100,000 and the net profit Pounds 3,665. Erscott is still in deficit because she has paid Pounds 12,000 of her own money into the business. But the figures are increasing yearly and she is able to compete with the supermarkets on the price of basic grocery lines. However, it's a tough life. Erscott, 62, opens from 7.30am to 6pm six days a week and also on Sunday mornings. She has an afternoon off on Tuesdays and employs two part-timers and one casual helper. Her wage bill is Pounds 100 a week. 'It's hard work and would not really be worthwhile without my Post Office salary of Pounds 4,000,' she said. Smith has a number of 'key criteria' he lists when advising groups that wish to rescue or restart a village shop. All tenants should have a minimum of Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 12,000 in working capital, he says, and if the building is to house a post office more may be needed. The catchment area should have a minimum population of 500 (at Halstock it is 400 including an adjoining shopless village) and minimum sales should be Pounds 70,000, with potential for increase. The skill and personality of the shopkeeper is another vital ingredient. 'I also point out that the landlord-and-tenant system, in which the village owns the shop, is by far the best if it can be arranged,' he said. 'I regard reverse credit systems, in which individual customers provide cash in advance for purchases, as often short-term and not getting to the root of the problem. They often result in saving the shopkeeper but not the shop. 'Basically, if here is a population of close to 500 and a potential turnover of Pounds 100,000 then a system like that at Halstock might work. If the figures are lower it is best to kick off by running the business using volunteers and see how it goes.' That is exactly what is happening at the village shop at Tallerton near Honiton in Devon, where the shop, which had been in the same family for three generations, closed last October. The villagers have raised Pounds 6,500 in loans and grants, and the shop reopens on February 22, staffed by volunteers. 'Once the long-term tenancy is secure and if all goes to plan we shall consider seeking a tenant to run the business,' said farmer John Carter, the parish council chairman. The villagers at Manaton, an isolated village on the edge of Dartmoor, hope to follow suit. Their shop closed last September. They plan to lease the shop premises from the widowed owner and former shopkeeper and initially to run the business using volunteers. Smith is sceptical about community shops, or enterprises run permanently by volunteer labour, of which he estimates there are some 20 in the country. 'A lot have failed or are failing because they are understocked and out-of-date in their methods,' he said. ViRSA's next task is to create a database of essential details of all the 6,000 or so village shops in the country that serve populations of under 1,000. 'We want to try and find out as much as possible about the health of these businesses and to let them know we are here to help if there is a crisis,' Smith said. ViRSA is a non-profit-making association and relies on the generosity of individuals and organisations wishing to support the cause of village shops.

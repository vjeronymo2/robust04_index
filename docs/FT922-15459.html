			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / IMF reaches agreement on membership terms for Russia RUSSIA should be a fully fledged member of the International Monetary Fund within about a month, following agreement yesterday morning by the fund's executive directors on the terms of its accession. These grant it a 3 per cent quota in the fund, enabling it to draw about Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.3bn) from IMF resources. It would rank as the eighth-largest regular member nation, behind Italy and Canada and ahead of the People's Republic of China. The 3 per cent figure is a compromise between the 2.5 per cent share originally proposed by the Group of Seven leading industrial countries and the 4 per cent-plus stake sought by Russia. In a statement, Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director, welcomed the return of a former part of the Soviet Union to the international financial community after a 45 year hiatus. He commended Russia for launching 'a bold and comprehensive economic reform programme', which, he said, 'represents a major step towards a market economy and macroeconomic stabilisation'. Mr Camdessus urged the Russian authorities to press ahead with economic reform as rapidly as possible. Adherence to the new programme would increase the understanding and support of other nations, as well as the IMF, he said. The IMF's approval should be supplemented today when President George Bush is due to outline what the US government is prepared to do to assist the former Soviet republics. The president postponed a scheduled speaking engagement on regulatory reform in order to fit in a policy statement. Mr Bush is expected to endorse a US contribution to a rouble stabilisation fund. Additional humanitarian assistance is also on the agenda. Much will depend on the degree to which the president commits himself to lobbying for his programme on Capitol Hill, where foreign aid in all its forms is not currently popular. According to IMF procedures, finance ministers from 150 countries will receive, probably this week, a draft membership resolution, requiring a response within 30 days. The necessary approval, IMF officials said, should be obtained by the next meeting of the IMF's policymaking Interim Committee on April 27. Russia is the first of the former Soviet republics to be approved for membership by the IMF's executive board. It follows close scrutiny by the board on Monday of the economic programme presented by a Russian delegation.</p>

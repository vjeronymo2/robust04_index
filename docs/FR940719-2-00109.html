			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> A14&blank;Reasons for Changes in Burden  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This is an original submission of a Request for OMB Clearance for the data collection of the MTO demonstration. Therefore, this section is not applicable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> A15&blank;Tabulation Plan, Statistical Analysis and Study Schedule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Currently, the intake phase of the MTO demonstration is scheduled to begin in June 1994 and end in June 1995. Including the FY 94 Notice of Funding Availability, this intake phase may be extended through June 1996.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Immediate plans for tabulation or other analysis of the data collected under this request for clearance are limited to those of the Contractor, Abt Associates, and to the period from the start of demonstration site operations (scheduled for June 1, 1994) until February 1995. The Contractor's Final Report will combine documentation of the MTO demonstration characteristics  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (including random assignment, outreach, training, and monitoring) with description of PHA and NPO operating characteristics as they relate to the demonstration. It will compare the counseling and search assistance delivered to experimental group participants (within the observation period) by the NPOs with the standard Section 8 counseling and other services routinely offered by the PHAs to Section 8 certificate- and voucher-holders. While the report will not contain any presentation of early participant or cost data from the demonstration, <FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>  it will amply document the design and early implementation of the MTO demonstration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Contractor's schedule, there would at best be 7 months of intake data available; it is unlikely that there would be much search or locational outcome data available. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In preparation for the end of the Contractor's period of work, and for assumption of data collection and monitoring activities directly by HUD, Department staff will develop plans for the tabulation and reporting of participant and cost data to Congress, as required by the statute authorizing MTO.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> Part B Statistical Methods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> B1&blank;Potential Respondent Universe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The potential respondent universe for the Moving to Opportunity for Fair Housing Demonstration consists of two parts: the families that apply for Section 8 through the demonstration (including informed consent to enroll), and the agencies that are involved in the administration of the housing assistance and counseling program that form the demonstration. As indicated in Part A of this request, the instruments for which clearance is requested fall into two groups, by parts of the potential respondent universe, as follows:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Data collection forms with participant respondents_the Enrollment Form and Participant Baseline Survey;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Data collection forms with agency respondents_the Participant Tracking Forms, Participant Counseling log (optional), Program Cost Forms, and Landlord Outreach Log.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> MTO Demonstration Participants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> MTO demonstration participants are those families that (a) respond to MTO outreach conducted by the site agencies, (b) receive information about MTO and about the different possible outcomes of applying (due to random assignment), and (c) agree to join the demonstration by signing the Enrollment Form. Such participants must be families with children currently receiving housing assistance (residing in either public housing or Section 8 project-based housing) in the high-poverty census tracts designated by the local housing authority for the demonstration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based upon the applications submitted by the five successful sites in response to the MTO NOFA, the size of the potential participant respondent universe is shown in Exhibit B.1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

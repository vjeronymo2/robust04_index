			<p>BFN     [Text] Problems slowing down the implementation of the  Cotonou peace agreement for Liberia have been the key elements  of lengthy discussions between the former NPRA [National  Patriotic Reconstruction Assembly] government's President  Charles Gankay Taylor and UN's special representative to  Liberia, Mr. Trevor Gordon-Somers. The meeting is believed to  have centered on removing obstacles in the way of the peace  process. Inside sources said one of the highlights of the  meeting was the slow pace of the deployment of the expanded  ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire  Monitoring Group] throughout Liberia which is a prerequisite to  the disarmament exercise of all fighting groups in the country.  This has been the hurdle in carrying out the military aspect of  the Cotonou accord.</p>

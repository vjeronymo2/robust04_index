The MOU delineates the responsibilities and procedures for ATSDR's public health activities at DOE sites required under sections 104, 107, and 120 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA, or ``Superfund''). These activities include health consultations and public health assessments at DOE sites listed on, or proposed for, the Superfund National Priorities List and at sites that are the subject of petitions from the public; and other health-related activities such as epidemiologic studies, health surveillance, exposure and disease registries, health education, substance-specific applied research, emergency response, and preparation of toxicological profiles. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Community involvement is a critical part of the HHS energy-related research and activities. The availability of a formal site-specific advisory committee composed of citizens of certain affected areas to provide consensus advice to CDC and ATSDR regarding these activities is necessary. CDC and ATSDR are currently taking steps to obtain authorization for a ``Citizens' Advisory Committee on Public Health Service Activities and Research at Department of Energy Sites'' to be chartered under the Federal Advisory Committee Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of this workshop is to provide interested parties an opportunity to give individual advice and recommendations regarding: (1) Community involvement between representatives of affected populations, Native American Nations, and CDC and ATSDR; (2) the principles and process of public involvement given the diversities of interests and needs of affected and potentially affected populations and Native American Nations; (3) the concerns and needs which may be common to all; and, (4) provide a public forum for citizens of affected populations.

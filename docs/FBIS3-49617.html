Major had said that the Czech Republic, Poland, and  Hungary were the Central European countries with the  fastest-developing democracies and the clearest demands for NATO  membership. Weiss said this meant the Slovak Government needed  to analyze the country's situation, since forgetting about or  directly minimizing Slovakia could lead to the destabilization  of the Central European region.    In connection with the demands of Hungarian minority leaders  formulated on January 8 at the meeting in Komarno, SDL deputy  and Council of Europe parliament representative Lubomir Fogas  pointed to the closing document of the Vienna summit of October  8-9 last year, which charged a committee of ministers with  drawing up a proposal for a supplement to the European Agreement  on Human Rights in the area of culture and individual rights,  especially the rights of national minority members.    This supplement, Fogas said, spoke unequivocally about the  solution of minority problems on the basis of the individual  rights of citizens, as declared by the Slovak Constitution. The  Komarno meeting had overstepped the framework of this  recommendation, he said.    The division of the country for administration is not a  matter of parcelling up land, but is an act which should use  social, economic, demographic, transport, and other analyses and  should not be limited merely to the national minority side of  the question, Fogas said. He added that the decentralization of  state power would be debated at Slovak Parliament's 26th session  at the end of January.</p>

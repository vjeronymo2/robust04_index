			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Letter: Champion of the banks Sir, Enough] The current bout of bank-bashing is now a bandwagon, upon which business and the public are jumping to mitigate their own woes, and the media to protect us all from the new 'bully'. I beg to differ. I applaud my local branch of National Westminster. As a self-employed bookseller in a small Welsh market town, I am hardly a large 'account', and the branch will earn little more from my modest transactions this year than it has for the last eight since we opened. But the manager is courteous, attentive and professional and responds positively to any well-presented business idea. His staff give me the sort of service I also try to employ. I do not find their charges other than competitive, and their recently extended opening hours suit me fine. If business is tough, look no further than the recession. If (heaven forbid) my business failed, my bank would not be the prime cause. John MacLean, Cowbridge Bookshop, 72 Eastgate, Cowbridge, South Glamorgan CF7 7AB</p>

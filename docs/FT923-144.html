			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Personal loans up as businesses repay debt COMPANIES continued to repay debt in the three months to the end of August, according to figures from the British Bankers' Association, which represents the nine biggest UK commercial banks. The figures underline the weakness in economic activity among businesses. The repayments were offset by a rise of Pounds 2.7bn in borrowing by individuals, mainly for house purchases, which the association thinks was largely due to the rush to beat last month's deadline on the reintroduction of stamp duty on all house sales. In the three months to August 31, construction companies repaid Pounds 657m. Other repayments came from hotel and catering groups (Pounds 410m) and property companies (Pounds 274m). Taking into account the activities of companies and consumers, total net lending on a non-seasonally-adjusted basis during the three months grew Pounds 2.3bn, as against Pounds 862m in the three months to the end of May. Seasonally adjusted, the two figures are Pounds 2.9bn and Pounds 3.1bn respectively.</p>

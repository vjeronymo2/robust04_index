			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] By 30 votes to 22, with 2 abstentions, the  Constitution and Justice Committee [CCJ] of the Chamber of  Deputies has just acquitted Deputy Ricardo Fiuza of the PFL  [Liberal Front Party] Pernambuco, from charges of being involved  in the budget scandal. [passage omitted]    Fiuza's acquittal has yet to be confirmed by the Chamber of  Deputies plenary.    The Attorney General's Office press secretary has reported  that the attorney general will file charges against Deputy  Ricardo Fiuza before the Federal Supreme Court for forgery of  documents when he added amendments to the 1992 Budget Bill after  it was approved by Congress.</p>

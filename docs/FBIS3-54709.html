			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tbilisi, 3 Jan -- IBERIA reports that in his address  on Gudauta radio, Vladislav Ardzinba, leader of the Abkhaz  separatists, said that he is skeptical about Georgian-Abkhaz  consultations which are to be held in Moscow on 11 January.    "In Tbilisi, they do not want to reconcile themselves to the  idea that Abkhazia will no longer be a part of Georgia.  Abkhazia has won the war. And conditions are set by the  winners not by the losers. It is only possible to talk about a  treaty being signed by Abkhazia and Georgia as equal entities.  Such a treaty will not in any way limit Abkhazia's sovereignty,  since we are also planning to sign similar treaties with Russia  and other neighboring countries.    "As for the return of the refugees, I believe that the  Georgian side is using this issue for speculative aims. We  prevent no one from returning home. However, many of those who  are on the run do not have a clear conscience. They know well  that nobody will forgive them their collaboration with the  occupation army. Those who met Georgian troops with open arms  will not be able to live in Abkhazia", Vladislav Ardzinba said.</p>

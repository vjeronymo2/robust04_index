			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the spokesman of the DPRK Foreign </F> Ministry on 29 November -- read by announcer]    [Text] The spokesman of the DPRK Foreign Ministry issued  the following statement in connection with the fact that  recently the U.S. President and other officials enumerated  violent words and behavior that greatly incite us, thus creating  a grave barrier in resolving the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula.    Statement by the spokesman of the DPRK Foreign Ministry:    Recently, unusual moves are appearing in the United States  that are creating a grave barrier in resolving the nuclear issue  on the Korean peninsula. At a meeting to announce the result of  the so-called U.S.-South Korea summit talks recently, U.S.  President Clinton made a violent remark by finding fault with  us, saying that if someone attacks us it will have to pay a dear  price. Officials in the United States are also inciting us  greatly and are making violent remarks running counter to  dialogue.    It might be that these words and behavior stem from the  purpose of having great influence over the South Korean person  in authority, but we cannot but deal with this matter in a very  prudent way because such words and behavior was made at a time  when the issue of holding the three-stage DPRK-U.S. talks was  put on the agenda. This can only be viewed as is a violent  violation on the principle of the DPRK-U.S. joint statement and  an act of betrayal on the other side of dialogue.    We put forth the package deal method out of the desire to  resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula in a  fundamental way from an equal and fair basis. Our package deal  method is a fair method wholly coinciding with the principle of  the DPRK-U.S. joint statement. The United States had assessed  this positively at one time.    If the United States accepts the package deal method which  we  put forth, all issues related to the nuclear issue will be  resolved including the issue of implementing the safeguards  accord, and there is no need to take a lot of time here.    However, currently, as the ringleader of the nuclear issue  on  the Korean peninsula, the United States is neglecting the  responsibility and position that they are entrusted with. Also,  it seems that while having no political principle, they are  moving toward the policy of pressuring and crushing [apsal] us  by even dragging in a perpetrator.    Predictions are prevalent within and without the Korean  peninsula that a war may break out during the current South  Korean person in authority's term of office. This is related to  the fact that the South Korean authorities are working in every  way to interfere in the smooth resolution of the nuclear issue  by driving a wedge in the DPRK-U.S. talks, and that they are  also continuously moving toward aggravating the situation.    The South Korean authorities are pretending to have some  kind  of interest in the implementation of the North-South joint  declaration on denuclearization. However in reality, they are  only abusing this as a damping device to interfere in the  DPRK-U.S. talks.    For the U.S. authorities to secretly scheme with these kind  of fellows shows that they are working to use South Korea as a  shock brigade in their policy toward Korea and in carrying out  their strategy in Asia by soothing the South Korean authorities  who are currently oversensitive and to save their face.    When viewing this, we do not know whether the United States  truly wants to resolve the issue through dialogue, or whether it  is pursuing the policy of acting hostile and crushing [apsal]  Korea in the same old way.    If the United States tries to crush [apsal] us by forcing  their unjust demands through pressure toward us, the dialogue  counterpart, the consequences arising therefrom will be truly  dangerous. If the United States thinks that pressure can work  on us, it is a miscalculation. It seems that the United States  does not yet know very well about its dialogue counterpart.    Our people and the People's Army will never yield to  anybody's pressure. When we declared our decision to withdraw  from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT], we were prepared  for all possible circumstances, and we are fully prepared to  safeguard the sovereignty of the country even if the worst event  such as sanctions or war is imposed on us.    If the United States truly wants to resolve the nuclear  issue, it must sincerely accede to the talks even now rather  than resorting to the method of pressure such as sanctions and  so on by running off the track of dialogue.    The South Korean authorities must realize that interfering  in  the progress of the DPRK-U.S. talks will only achieve ahead of  schedule their self-destruction. They must correctly find ways  to survive.    We want a peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue through  dialogue. However, if the United States makes a blank paper out  of the principle of the DPRK-U.S. joint statement and refuses to  hold the talks, there will be no need for us to uncomfortably  suspend any longer the effectuation of our withdrawal from the  NPT [urinun taehwarultonghan haengmunjeui pyonghwajok haegyolul  paragoitta. kurona migugi kkutnae chomigongdongsongmyongui  wonchigul paekjihwahago hoedamul kumandugettamyon urido choyak  taltoeui hyoryok palsaengul toisang pulpyonhage chongjisikyonoko  issul piryoga opkedoelgossida].    Dialogue is not a gift from one side to the other side, and  we have no intention to hold dialogue by receiving pressure.  The success or failure of the peaceful resolution of the  nuclear issue wholly lies on whether the United States has the  will to give up its policy of crushing [apsal] Korea.

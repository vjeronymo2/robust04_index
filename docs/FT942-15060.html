			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Railtrack plans cut in Pounds 1.8bn repair bill Railtrack, the company that took over British Rail's infrastructure this month, is planning to cut the Pounds 1.8bn annual cost of maintaining Britain's railway network. The costs squeeze is bound to raise fears of job losses among the 33,500 people employed in maintenance departments. It may have far-reaching effects for the hundreds of companies that have traditionally supplied British Rail. Mr Bob Horton, Railtrack's chairman, has identified cutting maintenance costs as a top priority if the company is to be profitable enough to be privatised. Railtrack will press for significant price cuts in negotiations over the next 12 months with the 14 regional units in British Rail Infrastructure Services (Bris), which maintains and renews track, signalling and power supply equipment. Reducing maintenance charges is one of the main ways Railtrack plans to earn the return on capital required by the Treasury and prepare the business for privatisation in a few years' time. It must earn a return of 5.6 per cent on its Pounds 6.5bn assets, rising to 8 per cent after four years, the Treasury has said. Initially Railtrack will buy maintenance services from the Bris units, but it hopes also to use outside contractors to increase competition. Ultimately the Bris units themselves will be privatised. Some are expected to merge to form larger, more viable organisations. Mr John Edmonds, chief executive of Railtrack, indicated that job reductions appeared likely. He said: 'I would not underestimate the working practice problems we face.' The move from internal agreements within a single organisation, British Rail, to the 'discipline' of commercial contracts negotiated between independent companies will bring about pressure for change in long-established supply relationships. The clampdown on maintenance spending is a central ingredient in Railtrack's programme to get better value for money from suppliers. Mr Horton said: 'We want to take the capital we have available and use it to get the railway into the state of maintenance it should be in. We don't want it sloshing around going to the person who shouts the loudest.' The government has allocated Pounds 500m to Railtrack for investment projects this year, rising to Pounds 750m in two years' time. Rail boss who may bury the hatchet, Page 6</p>

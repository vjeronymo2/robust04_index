			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed "SM/AZ": "Disarmament Conference in Geneva </F> Heads Toward Stopping All Nuclear Tests"]    [Text] Geneva 30 Mar (ATS) -- Nuclear tests have been  partially prohibited since 1963. The Disarmament Conference  devoted most of its winter session, which ended in Geneva on  Wednesday [30 March], to drawing up a treaty that would prohibit  all nuclear tests. The stage of declaring good intentions is  now past, and a treaty could be ready within the next 12 to 18  months, affirmed Mexican Ambassador Miguel Marin-Bosch.    Mr. Marin-Bosch, who is the chairman of the committee  responsible for negotiating such an agreement reiterated that  since the signature of the Treaty of Moscow in 1963 -- banning  nuclear tests within the atmosphere, in extra-atmospheric space,  and underwater -- more than 2,000 nuclear tests had been carried  out by the United States and the former USSR. Both these  countries, along with Great Britain, are signatories to the  agreement on a partial stop to tests.    Mr. Marin-Bosch underlined that a treaty prohibiting all  nuclear tests constituted a "very important" part of a universal  regime aimed at nuclear non-proliferation. In particular, this  regime involves negotiations on certain fissile materials, and  an agreement protecting those countries which have no nuclear  weapons.  <H5>  Ratified by 160 Countries </H5>   Some 160 countries have now ratified the treaty partially  banning nuclear tests. Moreover, the United States and Russia  have decided on a moratorium of their underground tests,  prolonged until 1995. Great Britain is de facto applying the  same rule.    For France, President Francois Mitterrand stated that his  country would also observe a moratorium for as long as he  remained president. China may shortly go ahead with a test in  the atmosphere. However, when deciding on its moratorium, the  United States probably estimated that fresh Chinese tests would  not undermine their technological progress, asserted Mr.  Marin-Bosch.</p>

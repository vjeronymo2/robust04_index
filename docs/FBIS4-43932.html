			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] After the UN Security Council squeezed through  its authorization of the French military and humanitarian  mission in Rwanda, troops are continuing to arrive, in  particular in Goma in Zaire. [passage omitted] The man appointed  prime minister just after the Arusha agreements last year,  Faustin Twagiramungu, who was very wary about the principle of  intervention a few days ago, appears more willing to accept it  today, as he told Assane Diop:    [Begin recording] [Twagiramungu] The French program must be  (?undertaken). I did not meet with only the UN ambassador  Jean-Bernard Merimee; I also met the secretary-general of the  United Nations and other ambassadors. They all told me that it  was a matter of stopping the Rwandan tragedy, and that,  therefore, no one should oppose it. If the content of the  resolution is simply to stop the tragedy and not to drag us into  another conflict where France would come up against the Rwandan  Patriotic Front [RPF] on the ground, I think the resolution  should be accepted.    As far as I am concerned, I think I have a duty to make  contact with the RPF; to discuss and see what is positive in  this resolution; to agree, of course, that we should continue to  work to stop the massacres and put an end to the tragedy; and  also to ask France to stick to the content of the resolution  adopted by the United Nations. [end recording] [passage omitted]    Balladur was asked at the National Assembly in Paris who was  supporting France in this matter, and this is what he answered:    [Begin recording] [Balladur] In Africa, Senegal, with whom  we  have long been comrades in arms, will supply one unit.  Discussions are underway with other countries. The political  support of a large number of African states -- French speaking,  Portuguese speaking, and English speaking -- which has been  expressed to us directly, is encouraging. In Europe the  operation has the support of the Western European Union and  several member countries of that organization have told us they  are available to give logistic support: I can name Portugal,  Spain, Italy, and Belgium.

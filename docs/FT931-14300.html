			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / International Bonds: Investors react positively to Portugal's Y75bn issue THE Republic of Portugal returned to the international capital markets yesterday for the first time since late 1988 with a successful Y75bn (Dollars 595m) five-year Eurobond. Bankers said the positive reaction to the issue reflected the strength of investor interest and the careful preparation undertaken by the lead managers, Daiwa Europe and IBJ International. Although the spread of 75 basis points over comparable Japanese government bonds was less generous than had been expected, it tightened immediately and ended the day at around 72/73 basis points. The only reservation expressed was that the issue could become illiquid if too many bonds end up in the hands of banks looking to swap the assets into floating rate instruments. The deal could mark the start of a steady flow of Portuguese borrowing, said bankers. At the end of last year, Portugal abolished the requirement for borrowers to place 40 per cent of any funds raised abroad in non-interest bearing deposits at the central bank. Portuguese borrowers are now free to borrow lower cost foreign funds. The republic plans to raise between Dollars 2.5bn and Dollars 3bn in 1993 to re-establish its position in the international capital markets and pave the way for borrowing abroad by its corporate sector. The treasury director, Mr Manuel Pinho, said last week that Portugal has a budgeted government deficit of around 4 per cent in the next fiscal year and foreign exchange reserves standing at Dollars 20bn, compared with Dollars 7.5bn three years ago. Portugal's early devaluation within the European exchange rate mechanism last year helped to avoid a substantial drain on its reserves, bankers said. Bankers reported a good level of demand for the latest large Eurosterling transaction, PowerGen's Pounds 250m, 10-year, 8 7/8 per cent issue through S. G. Warburg Securities. Japanese investors like utilities and the 10-year maturity is under-utilised because of the lack of swap opportunities, they said. Elsewhere, smaller D-Mark issues continued to emerge. DG Bank said the DM120m, seven-year, 7 5/8 per cent Eurobond it arranged for the Amsterdam-based financing arm of the Spar supermarket chain was targeted mainly at domestic retail investors. Bayerische Vereinsbank added to the supply of reverse floating rate note issues, with a DM100m, 10-year note through its Curacao arm. The coupon is 8 1/2 per cent for the first year, after which it will be set at 13.2 per cent minus six-month Libor. IMI Bank Luxembourg re-opened the European Investment Bank's recent seven-year, 12 3/4 per cent Lira issue, increasing the amount to L300bn from L200bn. The only change in the terms was an increase in the issue price to reflect generally lower yields and swap spreads in the medium to long-term area since the original tranche appeared, said IMI.</p>

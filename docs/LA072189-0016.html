			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MODERATE CAFFEINE OK FOR SOME HEART PATIENTS  </P> <P> Question: A friend of mine is being treated by a doctor for what he says is a  heart rhythm problem. In general, I'd say that he's a good patient because he  follows an exercise routine that his doctor set up for him and he watches his  diet and has lost several pounds. But he still drinks coffee. Either his doctor  has told him that he can have coffee, or he's drinking it against his doctor's  advice. Isn't he asking for serious trouble by using a caffeine?  </P> <P> Answer: Many physicians do warn their patients with heart disease about the  possibly dangerous effects of drinking coffee or, generally, using caffeine.  However, the results of one study suggest that caffeine used in moderation will  not have an adverse effect on patients in relation to heart rhythm  disturbances.  </P> <P> This does not mean that all heart disease patients can use caffeine with  impunity. Some patients may be particularly sensitive to the effects of  caffeine and may have to abstain completely. But these probably constitute a  small group. Of course, patients who have been told by their physicians to  avoid caffeine should follow this advice.  </P> <P> Q: If lung cancer can't be seen on X-rays until it's practically too late to do  anything about it, and if there are no other tests to show if a person has lung  cancer, what should a person look for in deciding whether to see a doctor?  </P> <P> A: Smokers should contact a physician without delay if they have a cough that  has persisted for a while, if they cough up blood and if they have experienced  an unexplained weight loss.  </P> <P> Q: My skin often gets dry, and when it gets dry, it itches. I know what to do  about it, but why would a doctor warn against scratching? It's not as if I have  blisters which can break if you scratch them.  </P> <P> A: Dry skin may not be blistered, but scratching dry skin may cause the skin to  break. And if this happens, bacteria may enter and cause an infection.  </P> <P> Q: Some friends and I have been reading about risk groups in relation to AIDS,  and we got to wondering which women are most likely to get the disease. Is  there any information gathered that would answer the question?  </P> <P> A: In the United States, women who use intravenous drugs make up the largest  group of women with AIDS.  </P> <P> Q: I would like to know if diet has any effect on the premenstrual syndrome.  Are there certain foods that women with the syndrome should avoid?  </P> <P> A: Some foods may tend to aggravate the symptoms of the premenstrual syndrome.  Salt, for example, may cause bloating and headaches, while sugar tends to  trigger a craving for certain foods. In addition, caffeine may lead to anxiety  and irritability.  </P> <P> Conversely, the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome may be eased by the adoption  of a nutritionally sound, well-balanced diet that emphasizes fruits and  vegetables, and lean meats and fish.  </P></p>

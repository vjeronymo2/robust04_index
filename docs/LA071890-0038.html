			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> 'COPS' A BLEND OF DRAMA AND REALITY  </P> <P> The ex-cop faces the camera, recalling the time he was shot in the chest  point-blank by a fleeing bank robber and later operated on without anesthetic.  But even 11 years later, the memory is still overpowering, and his voice breaks  into deep sobs.  </P> <P> This jolting footage of an anguished Jim Snidersich is the emotional  centerpiece -- and by far the most compelling aspect -- of "Top Cops," a  derivative CBS summer series premiering at 10 tonight on channels 2 and 8.  </P> <P> A production from Sonny Grosso and Larry Jacobson, "Top Cops" is a close cousin  of a recent short-lived syndicated series in which Grosso -- a former New York  policeman who helped break the famed French Connection case -- interviewed cops  about their most memorable moments in the line of duty. Grosso does not appear  this time. As in the earlier series, however, recollections from the officers  are blended with dramatic re-creations featuring actors, in an attempt to show  the perils and pressures faced by cops.  </P> <P> The Snidersich segment is indeed harrowing, and his survival -- which is never  fully explained -- seems miraculous. His own narration applies a dramatic  exclamation point to the simulated sequences.  </P> <P> It's the preceding two segments -- one about the dismantling of a bomb and the  other about a Secret Service agent's dangerous undercover work -- that have a  "Dragnet" just-the-facts quality and fail to capture the apparent suspense of  the actual incidents.  </P> <P> In that some of the re-created scenes focus entirely on criminals, moreover,  there's no telling how much of this "reality-based" series is reality and how  much has been made up to enhance the narrative. Whatever, too much of "Top  Cops" just doesn't work. HOWARD ROSENBERG  </P></p>

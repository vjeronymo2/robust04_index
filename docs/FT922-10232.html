			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Foreign Exchanges: US economic worries dominate WORRIES about the strength of the US recovery were once again the dominant feature of what was otherwise a quiet day of trading on the foreign exchange markets, writes James Blitz. Although some of the economic indicators coming out of Washington were in line with expectations, they suggested that economic growth in March and April was not as strong as in the first couple of months of this year. The US government's weekly figures for unemployment applications were unchanged at 404,000 for the week ending April 18. And the leading indicators, which rose 0.2 per cent in March, were not as strong as figures for January and February. Consequently, the dollar closed slightly weaker in London against both the D-Mark and yen, down from DM1.6565 to DM1.6525 and Y133.45 to Y133.35. 'The markets may feel that the pace of growth in the US has not been sustained,' said Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist of DKB International in London, 'and we could see a further weakening in forthcoming months.' Nevertheless, markets still have to weigh the uncertainty of a US economic recovery against political weaknesses in Germany and economic weakness in Japan. As a result, the D-Mark was unable to make much headway against other currencies, including sterling, which suffered from a heavy bout of overnight selling in the Far East. Having dipped overnight below DM2.93, sterling managed to climb back to its previous close in London of DM2.9325. The D-Mark also declined a little against the yen, slipping in Frankfurt to DM1.2427 per 100 yen from DM1.2393 earlier in the day. Uncertainty about the D-Mark was offset by suggestions that the Bundesbank's policy-making central bank council might raise rates further at its regular meeting next Thursday. Analysts noted that the rate for 3-month money in Germany's markets has climbed during the week from 9.60 per cent to 9.80 per cent, putting it above the Lombard rate of 9.75 per cent. Analysts believe this may force the Bundesbank to raise the Lombard rate to come into line with the market. 'High interest rates would be supportive for the mark, if not for a very good reason,' said one trader. The yen's modest gains yesterday against the dollar and D-Mark were interpreted as a sign that support given to the currency by the Group of Seven finance ministers at the weekend is working after all. On Wednesday the yen had eased against the dollar in New York trading, in spite of a declaration by the G7 that the decline of the yen was not contributing to the world's economic adjustment. The dollar finished lower in New York last night at DM1.6477 and Y133.20.</p>

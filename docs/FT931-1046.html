			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Remember third world, says Bank chief WESTERN governments must not allow the problems of Russia and other former Soviet republics to divert attention from the needs of even poorer countries in the third world, Mr Lewis Preston, the World Bank president, warned in a carefully timed speech yesterday. 'We must not neglect what is the fundamental challenge of the remainder of this decade: development - economic and social progress throughout the world,' he said, noting that 60 per cent of the world's population subsisted on less than Dollars 2 a day. The Group of Seven industrial countries is preparing a package of support for Russia. Mr Preston criticised governments for cutting aid budgets when the list of countries needing help was growing and called on the US in particular to honour its Dollars 3.75bn (Pounds 2.6bn) commitment to a planned Dollars 18bn replenishment of funds for the International Development Association, the arm of the bank that provides highly concessional loans for the poorest countries. Bank officials are worried that the US Congress may baulk at approving the US's generous contribution to IDA, which was agreed during the final months of the Bush administration. The fear is that the domestic sacrifices called for in President Bill Clinton's economic plan, coupled with pressure for increased financial support for Russia, will erode congressional support for foreign aid, which tends to be fragile at the best of times. 'Without US approval, the agreement could completely unravel,' Mr Preston said, noting that each dollar committed by the US was matched by Dollars 4 from other countries. Support for economic development was the 'only solution to the challenges of the post-cold war era', he said. There was a growing 'commonality of interests' between rich and poor countries because a fifth of world output was now traded between the developed and developing worlds. In the US, trade with developing countries was the fastest growing segment of the economy. Helping poor countries was thus 'one of the most effective ways to create jobs and wealth here in America', he said. 'Conversely, not helping the poorer countries carries negative consequences for us all' - including increasing numbers of refugees, spread of drugs and disease and the prospect of an 'irreversibly damaged' environment.</p>

			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRAVELING IN STYLE;  </P> <P> SHEER GRACE;  </P> <P> A VISIT TO MADEWOOD, 'QUEEN OF THE BAYOU'  </P> <P> As is his routine whenever he is in residence at Madewood Plantation, Keith  Marshall, impeccably attired, strolls through the antebellum home of an  evening, announcing to visitors that dinner is being served. In a scene harking  to an opulent life style in pre-Civil War Louisiana, guests gather as shadows  dance in the glow of candles and the fragrance of gumbo settles over this  exquisite room with its period antiques.  </P> <P> The friendly hum of conversation brings alive Madewood like no other antebellum  home between New Orleans and Baton Rouge. Known as the "Queen of the Bayou,"  Madewood is distinguished as a National Historic Landmark and is described as  the finest Greek Revival mansion in Louisiana -- as well as the friendliest.  With its Ionic columns, Madewood was the setting for the film "A Woman Called  Moses," starring Cicely Tyson.  </P> <P> Awakening at Madewood is like discovering oneself on a Southern plantation  during Louisiana's days of wine and wealth, long before that wealth vanished  with the ravages of a war that forever changed the course of American history.  Madewood, along with other plantations -- some spanning thousands of acres --  was the focus of a lavish period for the well-to-do. The mistresses of these  magnificent homes hosted teas and receptions, while the masters of these  mansions concentrated on the land.  </P> <P> Profits from sugar and cotton were enormous, fortunes that vanished with the  close of the war.  </P> <P> Once echoing with the voices of prosperous planters, these noble antebellum  homes in later times sheltered only the ghosts of the departed. Ghosts and  memories. Lace curtains rotted at the windows. Shutters rattled in breezes  pouring off the bayous and the Mississippi.  </P> <P> Although enemy troops had torched the surrounding land, the plantation was  spared by a Union general who took pity on a Confederate colonel's widow living  at Madewood.  </P> <P> The mansion is renowned as an extraordinary monument to the pre-Civil War  South, with caring owners who have transformed it into one of Louisiana's most  inviting guest homes. Other antebellum mansions have fared less well. Nottoway  and Oak Alley are in need of cosmetic face lifts. And nearby Ashland Belle  Helene is a tragic ghost, shutters peeling, stucco crumbling, floors rotted  through, a once-proud mansion that stands empty, vandalized, its veranda  festooned with bee nests, each of its ancient, untrimmed oaks dripping with  Spanish moss, looking like the hoary figures of a bent old man.  </P> <P> adewood was fortunate in that Naomi Marshall, art patron and spirited mover of  New Orleans' cultural events, was struck by the mansion's derelict condition.  Although she has never lived at Madewood, Marshall poured energy and a fortune  into the transformation of the old home. With a son, Keith, she restored a  relic that had been abandoned to the elements, its wallpaper stained, its  window sills rotting, its floors decaying, its plaster peeling, its attic  crawling with rodents.  </P> <P> Naomi Marshall's late husband didn't share his wife's enthusiasm, insisting  that he had "never seen anyone work so hard to lose money," alluding to the  idea that Madewood, which she bought in 1965, was a nuisance and a burden that  would drain the family fortune. Undaunted, Naomi Marshall and her 41-year-old  son replumbed, rewired, reroofed and repainted Madewood until today it stands  as a classic example of a plantation home from the South's golden days.  </P> <P> Its polished floors shone brilliantly one recent afternoon as housekeeper  Thelma Parker led guests on a tour of the parlor, dining room, library and  ballroom, pointing out Madewood's marble fireplaces, a set of 18th-Century  Meisen, an antique piano and organ, along with other priceless pieces gathered  by Keith Marshall during his student days as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford.  </P> <P> Unlike other antebellum mansions with their roped-off rooms and ghostly  reminders of a period lost in the cobwebs of time, Madewood is alive with soul  and laughter and hospitality provided by Keith Marshall and his wife, Millie,  who were married at Madewood in a garden ceremony performed beneath an ancient  oak named for Millie's grandmother, a ceremony attended by hundreds of  relatives and friends. Millie Ball Marshall, a writer for the New Orleans  Times-Picayune, described her magic day in an article for her newspaper:  </P> <P> "It was without a doubt a grand wedding, and when the groom hugged the bride  after the ceremony, the guests burst into applause. Later, candles set in paper  bags illuminated the scene and gospel singers standing under a drooping oak  sang spirituals. Wearing a Victorian dress, I danced to 1940s tunes played by  the New Leviathen Oriental Fox Trot Orchestra."  </P> <P> Millie recalls how guests tapped their feet to the music while waiting for  helpings of jambalaya. It was a day that shed its magic in shadows cast by the  great white mansion and the spread of oaks.  </P> <P> Although less than two hours by car from New Orleans, Madewood is a lifetime  removed from the manifestations of that city. Madewood rises on a 20-acre  estate near Napoleonville, facing Bayou Lafourche and with the Mississippi  River flowing not far away. Its grounds are impeccable, its service without  fault. Morning arrives with a soft knock on the door and a pot of coffee  delivered by Thelma Parker, Clem Thomas or Jean-Marie Richard, who do turns as  chef, manager and tour guides.  </P> <P> One arrives at Madewood as one would to a friend's home, without the formality  of registering at a reception desk. Nor is it overrun with strangers, although  small group tours are conducted. Before dinner, guests join their host and  hostess for wine and cheese and conversation that hums throughout the old  mansion.  </P> <P> While visiting one afternoon with the Marshalls on Madewood's screened porch,  we watched clouds gather and the sky darken. Lightning flashed across the  heavens and the earth shook with thunder as daylight turned to dusk. Just as  quickly the skies cleared, leaving only wisps of cloud against an incredibly  blue Louisiana sky.  </P> <P> At Madewood, a handsome walnut staircase leads to guest rooms, one with a  four-poster and a Persian carpet, a full-length teardrop mirror, ancient  armoires and fresh flowers. Windows frame sugar cane fields that flow to the  horizon, and other rooms feature twin brass beds from the Ursuline Convent in  New Orleans, iron and half testers with feather pillows and down comforters,  cabinets crowded with books and magazines, and walls that are lined with scenes  of the early South. Meanwhile, other visitors retreat to a couple of  19th-Century cottages sheltered by Madewood's magnificent oaks.  </P> <P> Keith and Millie Marshall became innkeepers on impulse while paying bills a few  years ago. A caller inquired if they could accommodate three couples. Studying  the check he'd just written for a $450 electric bill, Keith said yes, of  course. How much, the caller asked? Dividing the electric bill by three, Keith  came up with a figure of $150 per couple, a rate that remains unchanged today.  </P> <P> Besides accommodations, the price includes breakfast and dinner, wine and  cheese parties and a belt of brandy at bedtime, making Madewood one of the  South's outstanding bargains. At dinner- time, Thelma Palmer delivers platters  of chicken and shrimp pie, gumbo, pumpkin, greens, corn bread, salad and bread  pudding. Breakfast is a symphony of ham, sausage, eggs, grits, biscuits and  fruit.  </P> <P> Of a lazy afternoon, guests rock contentedly on the veranda while sipping mint  juleps and lemonade and studying the cane fields that sweep for miles.  </P> <P> Inside this mansion with its splendors of a past generation, a sense of  well-being reaches out like the sweet scent of jasmine. Visitors are impressed  by a staff that swings into action at the slightest urging, a flashback to the  heady days of the South's prewar wealth.  </P> <P> Once, nearby Bayou Lafourche was navigable for steamboats cruising the  Mississippi. Showboats plied its waters as well, and the happy melody of  calliopes drew huge crowds. Slowly, though, the bayou narrowed, and during the  postwar years Madewood went through a succession of owners. Finally abandoned,  the mansion stood empty for nearly 20 years until Naomi Marshall took it upon  herself to restore it to its original splendor.  </P> <P> As Madewood came to life it became the scene of summer concerts, ballet on the  lawn, symphonies under the oaks and gospel singers who performed in the little  cemetery where the mansion's first family rests.  </P> <P> Naomi Marshall recalls how during the holidays Chester Freeman, a handyman and  deacon in the plantation church, recited the story of the birth of the Saviour  with such simple devotion that "guests were in tears." Then the beloved Freeman  died. Without him, Marshall confesses, Madewood isn't quite the same at  Christmastime, although there remains a night of caroling and a roaring fire in  an open hearth, twigs of holly and magnolia branches tied with red ribbon.  </P> <P> Guests are served cups of wassail, and after dinner the choir retires to the  staircase to sing "Silent Night." In the ballroom and parlor huge Scotch pines,  decorated with hand-crocheted ornaments, stretch floor-to-ceiling. Christmas at  Madewood is special indeed.  </P> <P> To hear Millie Ball Marshall tell it, operating a plantation guest home is hard  work. "Everyone pictures my husband Keith and me sitting in white rockers on  the balcony, sipping mint juleps. They envision me whooshing down the grand  stairway in a long dress and rustling crinolines, chattering to  elegantly-dressed guests." On the contrary, Millie insists that she and Keith  are on the run almost constantly.  </P> <P> Those who have slept in Madewood's four-posters and half-testers arrive from  such far-flung destinations as Britain, Denmark, Sweden, France and India.  Queen Elizabeth's first cousin was a guest. "Sometimes it's like a house  party," says Millie, whose mother-in-law, Naomi Marshall, "gives thanks to the  Lord for giving us the opportunity to renovate Madewood." Naomi Marshall smiles  reflectively. "Madewood," she says softly, "is only in our care. We never  really own anything in life, you know."  </P> <P> No telephones, no TV, peaceful moments and the fragrance of new-mown grass.  This is Madewood. Dating from 1864, it is a masterpiece of understated  elegance, with windows that frame the oaks and mists that rise from the bayous.  And always there is a pervading cheerfulness that provides guests with a sense  of well-being and a feeling of never having left home . . . or perhaps pleased  that one did.  </P> <P> To visit Madewood: The mansion faces Louisiana 308, 75 miles northwest of New  Orleans on Bayou Lafourche and 21 miles north of Thibodaux. From New Orleans,  take Interstate 10 toward Baton Rouge, leave the expressway at Exit 182 and  cross the Sunshine Bridge to Napoleonville.

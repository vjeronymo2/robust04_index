			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Software to ask hard questions / A look at a problem-solving package - Computing A FRIEND called to see me the other week. He was down at heart. He was thinking of quitting his business - a business he had put a lot of work into over the last eight years. His problem, the same one which faces many businesses during the recession, was a fall-off in sales and more recently, in spite of a great deal of effort on his part, even inquiries for his products were slowing down. A new piece of business software called Business Insight had been delivered to me earlier that week and l needed to try it out with real data. Would my friend act as a guinea-pig? He agreed and we sat down together to run through the program. Business Insight is a software package that has been available in the US for a year or so. The new Windows version has just found a distributor in the UK. It is a system for the strategic analysis of both manufacturing and service industries. My friend's background is in sales and marketing. He was familiar with many of the ideas behind the questions. He had come across them over the years at various seminars and had read about them in the books of business gurus such as Drucker, Peters and Porter. But, he never asked those questions of his own business. Even if they were answered how could he interpret them: how could he rate the importance of each point? As we ploughed through the question and answer routine, he saw where some of the questions were leading. The program is not one you can complete in a few minutes. If you include time spent thinking about the answers the process of inputting the data takes several hours. It requires answers to questions about the abilities of all those involved with your business from the financial director to the receptionist answering the customer service inquiries. It needs details of your competitors, their financial position and how likely they are to retaliate to your marketing efforts. The result of all the data is a report developed after the program has carried out the analysis. It program assesses the data and produces a report. This is contains more than 70 pages of valuable information in plain English. How is my friend doing now? His greatest attribute is that he does not sit around waiting for something to happen. He read the report over that weekend and immediately instigated some of its recommendations. Only four weeks later he has several inquiries about his machines. He is demonstrating them to his potential customers this coming week. We cannot be sure that my friend's upturn is a result of using the program - but it seems a little more than mere coincidence. Business Insight costs Pounds 399 plus VAT and carriage from CABC, PO Box 162, Newbury, Berkshire RG15 OAP. Telephone: 0635-255300 Fax: 0635-255148</p>

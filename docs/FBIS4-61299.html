			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] At the meeting in Kiev with the Minister for  European Affairs, Alain Lamassoure, President Kravchuk expressed  gratitude to France for help it provides to Ukraine in scrapping  nuclear weapons and providing safety for nuclear power stations.  He said that the country's leadership appreciates a change in  the relationships between the West and Ukraine after the  three-partite agreement on nuclear weapons was signed in Moscow.    France's representatives are part of the G-7 delegation  currently in Ukraine, which arrived in the Republic to study the  situation at Ukrainian nuclear power stations. Deputy Prime  Minister Valeriy Shmarov told reporters that Ukrainian leaders  will sign no documents on the results of the visit with G-7  inspectors.    INTERFAX note: The delegation includes senior officials of  the G-7 nuclear energy ministries, the nuclear security fund of  the European Bank for the Reconstruction and Development, the  U.S. Department of State. The delegation intends to prepare  materials for the G-7 summit in Naples, which explain the need  of the economic aid to Ukraine.    Shmarov said that at their meeting members of the delegation  expressed preparedness to provide a financial aid to Ukraine in  the development of the nuclear energy and for higher level of  safety at the Ukrainian nuclear power stations. This aid will  be given if Ukraine refuses to commission the second block of  the Chernobyl nuclear power station and agrees to the gradual  closure of the first and third operating blocks.</p>

			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: 3i Yesterday's falling market was hardly an auspicious backdrop for 3i to launch its pathfinder prospectus. The venture capital company has a fair wind behind it nonetheless. Assuming it is sold on a reasonable discount to net assets, the issue involves only around Pounds 700m in new money. Since 3i will be snapping at the heels of the FT-SE 100 index, if not a constituent, institutions will need to acquire stock for weighting purposes. And since it is deeply involved in the small company sector, which is highly geared to economic recovery, the chances are it will outperform. The more difficult question is how far 3i is different from the run-of-the mill venture capital investment trust. Its argument that its broadly-based portfolio, close relationships with its customers and long-term approach to investment has considerable appeal. It should make of 3i a stock which shows both high growth and relatively low volatility. That does not free it from the effects of the economic cycle - last year's underlying 30.3 per cent total return could not be sustained in a downswing - but the 10-year record does show a higher average return than other venture capital and small company investment trusts. To some extent the comparison may be distorted by different methods of valuing unrealised investment gains. 3i's approach is linked to the equity market because it makes heavy use of market multiples. Its long-term average return at 16.1 per cent is only just higher than the Hoare Govett Smaller Companies Index. Buyers may not require a discount to net assets as large as the 15 per cent applying to venture capital investment trusts. But the difference will not be great.</p>

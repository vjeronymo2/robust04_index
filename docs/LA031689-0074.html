			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: LET'S GET ON WITH LIVING -- FREE OF GUILT  </P> <P> My mother told me the other day (with a straight face) that an 83-year-old  woman at a Weight Watchers meeting slowly approached the instructor afterward  and said, "Tell me again what I'm not supposed to eat."  </P> <P> That is the most depressing thing I've heard all year.  </P> <P> When does it stop? Isn't there ever a time when we can accept the principle of  gravity and get on with our lives? How many years do we have to choose between  an olive and three days of serious bloating? How long can a woman be expected  to live by the old adage: The shortest distance to water-pill thinness is a  straight line to the bathroom?  </P> <P> Two women were talking in aisle 4 of the supermarket a couple of days ago. I  overheard one say, "Isn't it a shame Liz Taylor is putting it back on?" One of  the women had three chins and the other couldn't see her shoes for the  overhang. I wanted to say, "I heard the horse she rode in 'National Velvet' has  gone to pot too!" My God, when is the public going to give this woman  permission to be 57 years old and in charge of her own life?  </P> <P> Who cares if Oprah had a hamburger or if the grease dripped off her elbows? Or  if she eats both ears off a 6-foot-tall solid chocolate bunny? Fans want their  idols to stop the clock. They don't want to see Barbara Walters wear glasses,  Raquel Welch become a grandmother or Angie Dickinson with gray hair.  </P> <P> I don't know the logic, but it probably has something to do with the public's  own mortality. They're the same age and they could look that good if they had  money. They don't make those same kinds of demands of public politicians,  authors, artists, musicians or corporate executives.  </P> <P> At a luncheon recently, I quietly observed four women at the next table.  Between all the lifts, tucks and nips, there was enough skin and fat left over  from the four of them to make a fifth person. All of them sat around with a  surprised look on their faces. If the stock market crashed, not one of them  could have blinked an eye, let alone express emotion.  </P> <P> It occurs to me there should be some kind of correlation between your mind and  your body. What does it profit a 78-year-old woman to sit around the pool in a  bikini if she cannot feed herself? Or to have your face lifted and not remember  who took it?  </P> <P> There's a compulsory age for everything in this country. You are told when to  receive Social Security, to retire, to reach adult status, to drink alcohol,  vote and enter the first grade.  </P> <P> Is it too much to ask, "When am I old enough to pig out?" without having to  fall on your knees and confess, "Bless me, Jean Nidetch, for I have sinned"?  </P></p>

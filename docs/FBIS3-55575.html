			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Veronika Romanenkova and Semen </F> Ivanov]    [Text] Moscow January 7 TASS -- Twenty-four hours are left  before the start of the 15th main space expedition to the "Mir"  orbital station. It is scheduled for 13.05 minutes 32 seconds  Moscow time, January 8.    A "Soyuz TM-18" vehicle with three cosmonauts on board is to  be orbited by Russian military-space forces from the Baykonur  cosmodrome. The rocket is already in position on the launching  pad. A meeting of the state commission is to endorse the main  and stand- by crews today.    At present, the main crew includes Viktor Afanasyev  (commander of the vehicle), Yuriy Usachev (board engineer), and  Valeriy Polyakov (research cosmonaut, physician). The stand-by  crew includes Yuriy Malenchenko (commander) and Tolgat  Musabayev (kazakh board engineer). The docking of the "Soyuz  TM-18" vehicles with the "Mir" orbital complex is to take place  at 14 hours 50 minutes Moscow time on January 10 (plus-minus 10  minutes).    The members of the 15th main expedition will work on board  the station for three days together with the crew of the 14th  main expedition -- Vasiliy Tsybliyev and Aleksandr Serebrov, who  began their orbital flight on July 1st, 1993. Tsybliyev and  Serebrov had to remain on orbit for 146 days (until November 24,  1993), but due to difficulties with the timely delivery of  carrier-rockets for the "Mir" complex, the crew's stay on the  orbit was prolonged for 200 days (until January 17, 1994). The  cosmonauts agreed to this prolongation. And now the landing  capsule of the "Soyuz TM-17" transport vehicle is expected to  touch down at 11 hours 25 minutes Moscow time, January 14.    Tsybliyev and Serebrov have made five exits into open space  in the course of the flight, remaining there for a total of 14  hours 2 minutes. The implementation of the planned research  programme and experiments was impeded by the limited financing  of technological, biotechnological, geophysical and applied  studies. Therefore, priority attention had to be given to  research carried out on the commercial basis (for instance,  nature studies and ecological research carried out to German and  American orders), to astrophysical experiments ordered by the  space research institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and  also to works needed to draw up a target programme for the  "Mir-2" station.    The 15th main expedition is to stay on the orbit for 179  days  (up to july 4). But the research cosmonaut (physician) will  remain on the orbit for a much longer period -- 427 days. He  will play host to two more expeditions on board the "Mir"  station this year, first to the 16th expedition which is to last  for 135 days (from June 22 to November 2), and to the 17th  expedition, which is to last 157 days (from October 3). The  17th main expedition will include a representative from the  European Space Agency.    The experiments that are to be carried out during the 15th  main expedition will focus on medical research. No exits into  the open space are planned. Supplies to the "Mir" station will  be brought by three cargo "Progress M" transport vehicles.</p>

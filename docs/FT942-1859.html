			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Guilt trip to Rwanda The slaughter in Rwanda began well over two months ago, after the death of President Juvenal Habyarimana in an air crash on April 6. It quickly became clear that the death toll was running into hundreds of thousands. The UN's first reaction was to pull out most of the 2,500 troops it then had in the country. By May 16 the Security Council felt sufficient collective shame to decide that a larger force of 5,500 men should be sent in. After a certain amount of arm-twisting, African countries from Senegal to Zimbabwe came up with offers of troops. But the logistics, weapons and specialised units were to come from industrialised countries. For most of those the UN is still waiting. Suddenly last week, as if waking from a deep sleep, the French government informed the world that what was happening in Rwanda was intolerable, that something should be done to stop it, and that France was ready to send troops. Why? The usual explanation applies. The massacres had become unpleasantly visible on French television, aided by a visit from the ever-telegenic Dr Bernard Kouchner, minister for humanitarian affairs in the previous French government. Western conscience Better late than never, perhaps; and conscience is still conscience even when pricked by television. But the French conscience in this case, like the western conscience in the case of the Iraqi Kurds three years ago, is pricked not only by solidarity but also by guilt. The Rwandan government and army, instigators of the current genocide, were bolstered until very recently with French military and financial support. France's desire to halt the unintended consequences of its past policies is no doubt laudable. But understandably the guerrillas of the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front distrust French motives, believing the real object of the planned intervention is to deny them an outright victory in the civil war. They have rejected the plan, warning that they will treat any French soldiers in Rwanda as hostile. Yesterday they rejected an invitation to Paris for talks. The French plan also appears to lack any clear objective beyond the immediate emotional imperative of rescuing civilians trapped in the conflict. But as the Somali imbroglio made clear, rushing into a humanitarian intervention without a political masterplan carries the risk of trapping soldiers in a military operation without clear goals or a defined exit. It is somewhat naive to believe that French forces will be able to protect civilians without getting caught up in the conflict. Liberating civilians from government concentration camps would involve taking on unruly militias enlisted by the army to halt the rebel advance. Nor is it clear how public opinion will react in France if the intervention force begins to suffer casualties. UN plan In short, France would do much better to throw its weight behind the existing UN plan, with a view to beefing and speeding it up, than to proclaim a brand new French initiative and charge in at the head of an ad hoc force. It could also play a useful diplomatic role, by exercising leverage on its former proteges in the Rwandan government. On the RPF side (which certainly needs to show moderation if genocide is not to be avenged by the imposition of minority rule) leverage could best come from President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda. Ethnic ties being stronger than state frontiers, many RPF fighters owe weapons and training to previous service under his command. But many more questions need to be addressed by the UN membership as a whole, and especially by the permanent members of the Security Council. Perhaps these two are the most urgent: Should they be sending troops to Rwanda, in the probably vain hope of stopping a massacre when so many thousands are already dead; or would they do better to deploy a force in neighbouring Burundi, where genocide between the same two ethnic groups might yet be prevented? If they really want the UN to be able to intervene effectively and in good time when such horrific conflict breaks out, should they not endow it with a properly trained and equipped standing force, ready to leave at a moment's notice?</p>

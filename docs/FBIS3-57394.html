The president unequivocally favors the restoration and  development of economic ties among the CIS countries and the  states of Eastern Europe. At the same time he emphasized that  the issue of restoring all previous interstate ties should not  arise.    Karimov also noted that Russia continues - and I quote here  -  to play the role of a dictator with regard to countries which  used to form the USSR. The disintegration of the ruble zone is  a good example of this, the president of Uzbekistan claims, for  it was at that time that Russia made its partners face the  necessity of introducing their own currencies.</p>

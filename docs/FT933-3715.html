			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Despatches: The navy lark - Christina Lamb on the aspirations of Bolivia's landlocked sailors CAPTAIN Luis Aranda is the proud commander of the fleet of the fourth base of the Bolivian navy. But the only ships at his command are those he makes at home from matchsticks, along with a motley flotilla of five small metal ferry and patrol boats that are gently rusting in the waters of Lake Titicaca. Aranda's 150-strong division spends most of its time raising chickens and cultivating prize tomatoes. The reason: Bolivia may have a navy, but it has no sea. Bolivia has been landlocked since losing the War of the Pacific against Chile in 1879. From the moment one arrives in the Andean city of La Paz it is evident that neither the rarified air nor the passage of years have served to quell passions; indeed, the issue is a national obsession. A plaque at the airport asserts that Bolivia is a maritime nation. Bright-coloured stickers in taxicab windows scream 'The Sea Belongs to Us - To Recapture it is Our Duty.' Newspaper editorials rail almost daily at Chile's mulishness in refusing to relinquish the land that blocks Bolivia from the Pacific coast. El Mar Boliviano is a primary school set-textbook crammed with pictures of crashing waves described as 'our sea.' Statues in otherwise peaceful town centres depict demonic Bolivians bayoneting hapless Chileans above the inscription: 'What once was ours will again be.' 'We're the only landlocked nation in the world', is a frequent complaint from locals, blaming Bolivia's glaring poverty on its lack of coastline. They will not listen if one points out other examples of sea-less nations such as Switzerland, Austria, Paraguay. Bolivia is certainly one of the world's most unfortunate or misguided nations. Once the second largest country in Latin America, it has lost territory to almost all its neighbours in wars. But it is the loss of the sea that really rankles. At every international conference Bolivia raises the issue, demanding its land back, and Chile always says No. On March 23 every year a Day of the Sea is held to mourn the loss, and 30 years ago the navy was re-established to show that Bolivia would never yield. A smart 10-storey building was recently constructed to house the high command of the 8,000-strong navy and its two-ship fleet. On the top floor sits the commander-in-chief himself, Admiral Miguel Alvarez. Surrounded by pictures of ships on the high seas, he booms: 'The sea is in the soul, spirit and heart of every Bolivian. Everyone.' Admiral Alvarez believes that with the end of the cold war it is time to solve territorial disputes such as that between Bolivia and Chile. 'We have great hopes from the new world order and will raise this issue at every forum until we get a satisfactory resolution reintegrating the land which, by historic, geographic and legal right, belongs to this country.' He thinks Britain should take a lead in this process, claiming that British merchants in Chile, seeing the value of nitrates in Bolivia, inspired and funded the Chilean invasion of the Bolivian port of Antofagasta. Apparently, during Queen Victoria's reign, maps of the region were printed in Britain omitting Bolivia altogether - clear proof of conspiracy. In the meantime, as he waits for Britain to get its act together, the admiral sees nothing incongruous about being commander-in-chief of a navy which has no sea. He admits a certain envy for neighbouring maritime nations such as Argentina, Peru and Brazil, on whose charity he relies to allow his forces to practise. If they are lucky, Bolivian naval cadets go to sea once a year. Out at the fourth naval base of Tiquina on Lake Titicaca, Capt Aranda says his men are ready to take to the high seas at any time. While they are waiting for the great day, the Bolivian navy is giving a useful lesson to the rest of the world in how to utilise an idle military. Capt Aranda's men patrol the lake looking for Sendero Luminoso guerrillas in hiding from Peru, and his colleagues in the Amazonian naval bases chase narco-traffickers. But most of the time the men of the fourth base are engaged in raising chickens, growing vegetables and planting trees to replace those removed by locals. 'Perhaps you might think it a little strange to see a navy growing vegetables', says the captain as he shows off a splendid selection of lettuces and tomatoes, 'but armed forces should adapt to the necessities of the situation. It's our duty to contribute to the development as well as the defence of the country.'</p>

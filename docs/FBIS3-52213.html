The Kashmir issue will  be an independent item on the agenda of the talks which will be  spread over four sessions as India has agreed to discuss all  aspects of the problem.    Authorities in Islamabad are not optimistic about the  outcome  of the talks, for India has not so far stopped repression  against the people of Kashmir in the occupied territory.  Pakistan had asked India to end human right violations in  occupied Kashmir immediately and to reduce its troops in the  valley, leading to a total withdrawal, in order to create a  conducive atmosphere for holding the talks.    The foreign minister, Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali, has said with  all the killings going on in occupied Kashmir, with women being  raped, with villages being set on fire, and with the repression  going on, how can one feel optimism. He said this is the last  opportunity for New Delhi to prove that it is sincere in solving  the Kashmir issue through negotiations. If India, he added,  fails to take even the minimum steps, then it is its last chance  for the talks. Pakistan would not hold any further talks and  instead take up the issue at international forums and inform its  friends that New Delhi is not sincere in solving the issue.  Pakistan, the foreign minister said, is taking part in the  talks so that India could not say that Pakistan is avoiding a  negotiated settlement of the issue. We believe negotiations are  the most civilized manner to settle disputes.    Commenting on the claim of the Indian foreign minister that  Kashmir is an integral part of India, Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali said  on the one hand India had accepted Kashmir as a disputed  territory and agreed to hold talks on the issue as a separate  agenda, while, on the other hand, it is claiming that Kashmir is  its integral part. One can judge the sincerity of the Indians in  holding these talks and solving the problem, Sardar Asif Ahmad  Ali said.</p>

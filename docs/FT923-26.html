			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Money Markets: Uncertainty reigns THREE month money in the sterling cash market fell below the 9 per cent base rate figure as dealers started to discount the possibility of another cut in UK rates before next week's Conservative party conference. The rate for three month money fell to 8 15/16 per cent on the offered side as dealers speculated that the Chancellor would take the opportunity to cut rates next week. That view was reinforced by sterling's slightly stronger performance on the foreign exchanges, with the currency rising more than a pfennig against the D-Mark yesterday to close at DM2.52. However, there is continuing doubt about the direction of the UK government's economic policy, and trading was thin. Sterling futures tracked a different course from the cash market. The December contract fell one basis point from its opening level of 91.81 to close at 91.80, reflecting a slightly firmer view on rates. Strictly speaking, the closing price assumes that 3-month money at the year's end will be at 8.2 per cent. There was no clear indication from the German money market as to the possible outcome of this Friday's Bundesbank council meeting. The German central bank again drained liquidity from the money market in the morning by sales of short-term Treasury bills. It is trying to combat the after effects of the recent interventions to support sterling and the Italian lira. The colossal scale of that intervention is becoming increasingly clear, with the bank reporting that its gross currency reserves were boosted by DM44.3bn in the week to September 23. This does not take into account the full cost of intervening to support the French franc, and one London-analyst believe that the final cost may be around DM90bn. However, the Bundesbank later tempered the move by lending funds to banks at a rate well above the market level. It injected funds into the market at a rate of 9.20 per cent, slightly above call money which traded at 8.80-9.00 per cent. In its money market operations, the Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 800m in the morning and, in early operations, purchased Pounds 450m in a repurchase agreement at 8 15/16 per cent. The forecast was later revised down to Pounds 500m and late assistance was provided of Pounds 55m.</p>

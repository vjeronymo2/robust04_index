			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / C &amp; W in joint venture to provide Russian networks CABLE &amp; Wireless, the UK-based telecommunications group, has formed a joint venture to provide long-distance and international communications networks to Russia's main business centres. A final go-ahead for the project depends on a study into its financial and technical feasibility. The joint venture, Metropolitan Communications, is 50 per cent owned by C &amp; W, and 50 per cent by Intertelecom. State-owned Intertelecom is the main provider of long-distance and international telecommunications services in Russia. The aim of the joint venture is to modernise, develop and operate long distance and international networks in Moscow, St Petersburg, the 'Golden Ring' of large towns surrounding Moscow and Russia's main oilfield. C &amp; W has an exclusive arrangement with Intertelecom for these geographical areas, but the Russian carrier may form different joint ventures in other areas. Intertelecom no longer has monopoly rights to provide telecommunications services in Russia, although it is the largest operator. Metropolitan Communications is one of the most ambitious joint ventures between a western telephone company and a telephone company from the old Soviet bloc. Over the past two years, the governments of eastern Europe have made investment in telecommunications, which was neglected under Communist rule, a priority. C &amp; W refused to name its likely financial commitment to the project, but said it would probably be looking for World Bank financing. Lord Young, C &amp; W's chairman, said the group would only proceed with the project if it met 'our exacting investment criteria'. The feasiblity study will be completed by the end of the year. C &amp; W is aiming to increase its investment in eastern Europe. It has already started building a telecommunications network for the city of Gdansk in Poland. Sprint, the US telecommunications group, yesterday announced that it had formed a joint venture with the Russian Ministry of Communications to build a nationwide data communications network in Russia. Sprint already provides international data communications services from Moscow and St Petersburg.</p>

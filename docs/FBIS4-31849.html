			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Mistrust for Coming Census"] </F>   [Text] The Association of Serbs and Montenegrins in  Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]  cannot accept the results and the census itself as objective,  representatives of the association said at yesterday's press  conference. The association president Nebojsa Tomovic said the  census will be just another step towards federalization of  Macedonia and meeting the demands of Albanians at the cost of  the Serbian population in Macedonia, whose real number is  minimized. The association announced an inner census only for  the Serbian minority, in order to come up with exact figures of  Serbs living in Macedonia.</p>

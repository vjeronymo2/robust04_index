			<p><P> July 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IMELDA WATCH;  </P> <P> DICK TRACY DOCTRINE  </P> <P> Midway through the trial of Imelda Marcos and Adnan M. Khashoggi, U.S. District  Judge John F. Keenan asked what turned out to be the decisive question: "What  am I doing here (in a New York City courtroom) trying a case involving the  theft of money from Philippine banks?"  </P> <P> In the minds of the jurors who acquitted both defendants on all charges, the  answer was clear.  </P> <P> "It was on the wrong side of the ocean," juror Thomas O'Rourke said. "It was a  totally silly case. We are not big brothers to the people overseas."  </P> <P> There is no better common-sense rebuttal to the Bush Administration's claims  for the new reach of American law, an act of self-assertion that the Justice  Department calls "extra-territorial jurisdiction." This novel theory holds that  U.S. authorities may seize and try citizens of other nations for acts committed  outside the United States. This also is the presumption under which the  government seized former Panamanian strongman Manuel A. Noriega. Whatever the  wisdom of the U.S. military operation, the application of the extra-territorial  doctrine to his case is as legally dubious -- and, as it now appears, as risky  for prosecutors -- as it was in the Marcos debacle.  </P> <P> In both cases, our government is suggesting that it has a sort of custodial,  almost parental right to punish the leaders of other countries for their  corrupt misrule.  </P> <P> At the very least, it's a notion that, if pressed, could well exacerbate our  court congestion problem.  </P></p>

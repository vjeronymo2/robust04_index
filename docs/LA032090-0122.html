			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TINA BROWN AND A PARTY OF RENOWN;  </P> <P> BENEFIT: AFTER MRS. REAGAN JUST SAID NO TO PHOENIX HOUSE, VANITY FAIR'S EDITOR  SAID YES.  </P> <P> It's the do-good decade, proclaims Vanity Fair magazine. And few are better  placed to do it than Vanity Fair Editor in Chief Tina Brown. After six years at  the helm, she is New York's priestess of glossy publishing, the turnaround  artist who molded a tottering, year-old magazine into an upscale, high-profile  monthly. (Circulation was 220,000 when she took over; it was 760,000 at last  count, and advertising has tripled, too.)  </P> <P> Like her magazine, which offers in-depth stories on pop stars and global  politics in the same issue, Brown has a glittery, fun-loving facade buttressed  by intellect.  </P> <P> Also like her magazine, which features coverage of night life on the back pages  every month, Brown enjoys nothing more than a good party. Make that a  "brilliant" party.  </P> <P> That is why the British-born editor, 36, flew to Los Angeles recently with what  she calls her "inner circle" of "brilliant party minds" to plan Thursday's gala  at Culver Studios, advertised as the "first great Hollywood benefit" of the  1990s.  </P> <P> It is a fund-raiser for Phoenix House, the New York-based, nonprofit drug  rehabilitation program that has four facilities in California and was about to  build a fifth, in Lake View Terrace, until Nancy Reagan withdrew her support  last September.  </P> <P> She pulled out after residents near the proposed San Fernando Valley site said  they did not want a rehab center in their neighborhood and threatened to picket  her Bel-Air home.  </P> <P> The party invitations read "Just Say Yes," and about 500 people have said it,  at $250 per ticket. Understandably, Mrs. Reagan is not one of them.  </P> <P> Mrs. Reagan's withdrawal in midstream left Phoenix House founder Dr. Mitch  Rosenthal with $2.8 million worth of donations already collected, much of it  from Reagan friends, and another $2.4 million pledged but never received.  </P> <P> Rosenthal, who flew to Los Angeles with Brown, says some donors asked for their  money back when Mrs. Reagan withdrew her support. He told them it would be  "legally incorrect," and they did not pursue the matter.  </P> <P> He also says he might have proceeded at the site even without Mrs. Reagan's  support if all the pledged donations had come through. Despite residents'  protests, he explains, the Los Angeles City Council was favorable to the  project, and he believes neighbors eventually would have come around, as they  have at other Phoenix House locations.  </P> <P> But back to the party, which may raise enough money for Rosenthal to buy and  build on a new L.A. site.  </P> <P> Brown promises it will be "riveting," with "extraordinary visuals" and a  "wonderful mix of people."  </P> <P> "It will not be suit meets suit and talks about deal," she explains, perched at  sofa's edge in the Four Seasons hotel lobby. "Suit is going to meet exciting,  new wonderful person. Suit is going to meet other suits, but he'll also meet  creative people, fun people, pretty people. It will be an electric mixture of  people," she says breathlessly in her soft, British accent. Parties obviously  excite her.  </P> <P> In fact, one of the two books she wrote while in her 20s is titled "Life as a  Party." It is a collection of profiles first printed in The Tatler, England's  oldest magazine, where she was editor from 1979 to 1983, and where she  increased circulation by 300% during her tenure.  </P> <P> Before that, she was named England's Young Journalist of the Year (1978) for  her columns in Punch Magazine. Her contributions to the New Statesman magazine  earned her the Most Promising Female Journalist award in 1975.  </P> <P> For Thursday's festivities, Brown has persuaded Broadway producer David Brown  to close the Booth Theatre in Manhattan for one night so "Tru" star Robert  Morse can fly to Los Angeles and perform an excerpt from the play about Truman  Capote at the benefit. Kid Creole and The Coconuts will provide musical  entertainment. Gianni Versace has donated $50,000 to help underwrite party  costs; the Gap also has contributed money. A donor who wishes to remain  anonymous pledged $200,000 for Phoenix House even before the party, and more  contributions are predicted after what Brown expects will be an "extraordinary"  evening.  </P> <P> It will be her first time ever to direct a benefit, she says with a laugh,  calling herself a "sort of virgin chairwoman." But she has given many parties  for the magazine, she says, recalling last year's fifth anniversary bash: "It  was a very stellar night. The late Steve Rubell of Studio 54 and his partner  Ian Schrager lent us the basement of the Century Paramount Hotel (in  Manhattan), which was the former Diamond Jim's Horseshoe. We turned it into an  incredible '30s supper club . . . with gold palm trees, an all-girl saxophone  band. It was wonderful . . . not just for the visuals, which were very  exciting, but also because of the mix of people. You had a Henry Kissinger side  by side with a rock star with a rich person. There were hip young people  gyrating next to heavy money. . . ." Her voice trails off, and her ice-blue  eyes melt just a little.  </P> <P> Brown first heard about Phoenix House, which treats adolescents and adults,  from a friend whose drug-addicted stepson was "completely redeemed" there. She  decided to run a profile of "Dr. Mitch" in Vanity Fair, she recalls, and asked  writer Leslie Bennetts to do it. While researching the story, Bennetts learned  Mrs. Reagan had abandoned the project and the tale became more titillating and  complex.  </P> <P> After the story was published, Brown visited Phoenix House in Manhattan and was  so moved by what she saw there that she decided to give this benefit to try and  "get the money back that had been lost" by Mrs. Reagan's pull-out.  </P> <P> Brown says "the driving forces" behind the party are Vanity Fair's writers and  contributing editors, whom she labels "stars in their own right." Most will  attend, including Dominick Dunne whose new novel, "An Inconvenient Woman,"  features film industry folk who will be at the benefit and "who will recognize  themselves" in Dunne's book. Brown laughs delightedly, as if every little piece  of her party puzzle was falling in its proper place.  </P></p>

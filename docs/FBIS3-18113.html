A Bonn government spokesman  said today that DER SPIEGEL's information was "pure  speculation." The plans cited by the magazine were not known to  the Bonn Chancellery.    DER SPIEGEL had reported that a German administrator was to  rebuild the administration in the Croat-besieged Muslim  stronghold of Mostar on behalf of the European Union. German  police and administrators were to assist the "emergency mayor."  Under the Bonn plans, Bundeswehr medical officers were to run  the city's hospital and Bundeswehr engineers were to repair  bridges and roads.</p>

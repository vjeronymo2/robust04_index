			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Business and the Law: Pain-saving incentives - The latest insolvency rules for partnerships For many of the top commercial law firms the recent recession had little impact on gross revenues. That has been particularly true for firms with strong insolvency, banking and internationally based practices. Inevitably, however, the economic downturn threw up its fair share of casualties on both sides of the Atlantic. Some firms' troubles were more public than others. In the US, Boston's Gaston &amp; Snow went to the wall. In the UK, D J Freeman was one of the first to acknowledge publicly that it had financial problems - difficulties which, by all accounts, are now behind it. For others the pain is not yet over. Much has been written about the problems of City law firm Turner Kenneth Brown and its failure to clinch a merger with Alsop Wilkinson. And in the US last month, Lord Day &amp; Lord Barrett Smith, one of New York's oldest law firms, dissolved its partnership. Rumours continue to circulate in London about the precarious financial health of several well-known City law firms. But although many firms were open about laying off staff during the recession, few are prepared to follow D J Freeman's example and acknowledge financial difficulties in public. That is understandable, says Mr Christopher Honeyman Brown of accountants Binder Hamlyn. 'There is tremendous prejudice against professionals unable to manage their affairs, to the extent that they get into a money muddle. Accountants would certainly be discredited. Lawyers probably also,' he says. Fear of publicity also appears to have prevented many firms from confronting their financial difficulties and attempting to restructure. 'People do tend to bury their heads in the sand, especially partnerships with problems. They just hope they will go away,' says Mr Steve Hill of accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand. Part of the reason why partnerships in financial trouble prefer to soldier on rather than confront their problems is that, until now, they have had little incentive to restructure. When the 1986 Insolvency Act introduced new rescue procedures for companies and individuals, partnerships were left out. But this gap, long criticised by insolvency practitioners, is about to be filled. On December 1, the Insolvent Partnerships Order 1994 will extend the rescue culture to partnerships, allowing those in financial difficulty to make use of voluntary arrangements and administration orders for the first time. Under the old rules, an insolvent partnership could only be liquidated compulsorily or wound up by the partners' trustee in bankruptcy. Therefore, partnership rescues that have taken place tended to be through the use of serial individual voluntary arrangements (IVAs) for the partners. Under an IVA, any individual owing money can propose a scheme to their creditors to pay off their debts in whole or in part. For a voluntary arrangement to be accepted, 75 per cent by value of the creditors need to agree to it. This procedure has been used successfully for some partnerships, says Mr Hill. Serial IVAs were used for the partners of the London and Oxford branches of UK accountants Halpern &amp; Woolf, now merged with Casson Beckman. But in general they are too cumbersome for all but the smallest partnerships. 'The Halpern &amp; Woolf case would probably have been easier, cheaper and smoother under the new system,' he says. According to Mr Chris Hughes, head of Coopers' insolvency practice, the new law will make it easier to help medium and large partnerships, allowing some to survive which would not have done so before. It will aid professional partnerships such as solicitors, accountants and estate agents, where the main asset of the business is the ability to earn future profits. Such businesses are worth far more alive than dead, Mr Hughes says. But he adds the courts should allow the use of IVAs for small partnerships to continue, rather than force insolvency practitioners to use the panoply of corporate procedures for the husband-and-wife corner shop. That would be costly and of no benefit to creditors, he says. Mr Hughes is also concerned by the Department of Trade and Industry's insistence that partnerships should be treated in exactly the same way as companies, so far as is possible. An administration order - an interim arrangement to give a company protection from its creditors while it reorganises (often combined with a voluntary arrangement whereby creditors agree to compromise their claims) - does not provide any protection for individual shareholders. By implication, orders against partnerships will not provide any protection for partners either. But, he says, shareholders do not need protection, as they are not personally responsible for the companies' debts. Partners are, however. The other big change concerns the ranking of creditors. For more than 200 years, when a partnership has gone into liquidation or bankruptcy, each partner's private creditors have to be paid in full before any of their assets can be used to meet partnership debts. From December 1, as recommended by the Cork Committee as long ago as in 1982, the deficit in a partnership will now be a claim in each partner's own bankruptcy, and rank equally with the partner's private creditors. Mr Hill says the effect of this change could be dramatic and private creditors may no longer get paid in full. 'It means the local plumber is going to have a lower chance of getting paid if he deals with a businessman who is in partnership than he would if he dealt with a similar businessman who is a company director,' he says. So the new rule will favour creditors of the business over those of individual partners. But, Mr Hill says, that may be the incentive needed to keep the business alive. In the case of solicitors, where banks and landlords tend to be the main creditors, it may help to persuade banks not to pull the plug on financially troubled law firms. Will the new procedures work or be much used? If they give a partnership with a viable underlying business time to cut out dead wood, tighten cash management and present itself as a suitable candidate for merger, then they could prove valuable, says Mr Honeyman Brown. Mr Hill says it is difficult to gauge how much use will be made of the new rules. Insolvency practitioners are aware of several professional firms still in some difficulty, so if the new procedures get positive results, 'we may find, by demonstrating we have more strings to our bow, that we encourage some partnerships to confront their financial problems and use the new procedures to restructure'. Others are not so convinced. Mr Alan Perry, a partner of D J Freeman, says that any whisper of insolvency in a professional firm in the past has tended to lead to the rapid collapse of the business. 'Apart from isolated cases, I think the jury is still out on whether, and in what circumstances, a substantial professional partnership could go through an administration or a voluntary arrangement and survive,' Mr Perry says. There is also the hint that, with the recession over, the timing of the introduction of the new rules smacks of shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted. Mr Hill is not sure that matters. 'There's definitely less insolvency about. But that gives us plenty of time to de-bug it before the next downturn.'</p>

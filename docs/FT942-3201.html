			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / British Gas warns of no dividend increase British Gas warned yesterday that a new price formula for gas transportation charges would prevent from it increasing its dividend this year and could force it to curtail its Pounds 900m a year pipeline investment programme. The formula, a key step in the liberalising of the gas supply, was announced by Ms Clare Spottiswoode, director-general of Ofgas, the industry regulator. She is proposing that from next October British Gas be allowed to charge 14.16p per therm of gas that it transports through its pipeline. After that, annual increases will be limited to the rate of inflation minus five percentage points. The proposal will have no immediate effect on gas prices paid by consumers, which are covered by a separate pricing formula. Gas transportation charges amount to half the cost of gas delivered to the home. The formula will cover the transportation and storage arm which British Gas is having to set up as a separate unit, following last year's inquiry by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. It will sell its services both to British Gas and independent gas suppliers who are being allowed into the market over the next three years. Mr Cedric Brown, British Gas chief executive, said the formula was 'very tough and would leave us with an even more difficult task to deliver an acceptable return to shareholders'. 'Taken together with regulatory pressures as a whole, it will be difficult for the company to justify any increase in dividends for 1994,' he said. British Gas shares fell sharply on the news, closing down 17p at 272p. However, analysts said that Mr Brown's dividend warning had the greater impact. Mr Brown said British Gas was already being forced by the regulator to yield market share to new suppliers and was incurring heavy costs in hiving off the transportation network. Ms Spottiswoode said she believed the formula struck a good balance between the interests of British Gas's shareholders and those of gas consumers. She said the formula would only give British Gas a rate of return at the lower end of the 4-4.5 per cent range recommended by the MMC, but it allowed a higher return on new investment, giving the company an incentive to invest in the pipeline system. The formula will run to March 1997, the deadline set for full competition in gas supply. Mr Philip Rogerson, British Gas's finance director, said the price controls would make it hard to justify the Pounds 900m annual investment which the company had budgeted for it. However, the formula was also attacked by independent suppliers as too lenient. Mr Peter Bryant, vice-chairman of United Gas, said: 'British Gas has got what it wanted.' British Gas would still earn Pounds 3.3bn in annual revenues. Price formula, Page 9 Observer, Page 21 Lex, Page 22; London stocks, Page 42</p>

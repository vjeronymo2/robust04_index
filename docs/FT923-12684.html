			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (8): Analysts predict some nasty surprises among European results - Equities CONTINUED WEAKNESS in the Japanese equity market and Denmark's 'no' to the Maastricht Treaty eroded gains made by continental European bourses earlier in the second quarter. But the overall performance for Europe was helped by the UK, which had been given a hefty boost by the Conservative victory in the general election. According to the FT-Actuaries World Indices, Europe including the UK rose 0.2 per cent on the quarter, but excluding the UK it fell 2.2 per cent. Some analysts expect European stock markets to have a difficult time in the third quarter. They expect some nasty surprises to emerge from the first half results reporting season, in particular from cyclical industries, such as bulk chemicals. Analysts have already started to downgrade their earnings forecasts in anticipation of sharply lower second quarter results. 'People are not likely to be new investors at current levels,' says Mr Gary Dugan, European strategist at Baring Securities. He expects a fall of 5 per cent or more across continental bourses over the summer. In its global strategy review for the third quarter, UBS Philips and Drew is also negative about world equity markets, which it views as very expensive to underlying earnings. 'Earnings cuts are likely over the summer, and equities will continue to struggle,' it predicts. Germany is its market of choice in this environment, because it believes the German economy can buck the trend of slower economic growth, that German company balance sheets remain strong, and that German companies will be the first to take advantage when the industrial cycle finally turns up. Mr Dugan is neutral on Germany, because the negative impact of slowing economic growth and dimming hopes of an interest rate cut in the fourth quarter is offset by prospects of strong import growth in the US, which will draw in capital goods from Germany. France, on the other hand, is unlikely to make much progress before its referendum on the Maastricht Treaty, which may not be held until September. Goldman Sachs says that, on the premise that uncertainty relating to European Monetary Union (Emu) is likely to remain a dominant theme over the short term, it advises investors to opt for markets which are least vulnerable to monetary union, such as Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. Denmark's refusal to endorse closer European union troubled Spanish and Italian equities, as Emu's planned 'convergence' of European economic indicators was thrown into doubt. Emu was seen as helping to reduce inflation in southern European economies. According to the FT-A World Indices, Spain fell by 7.6 per cent in local currency terms, while Italy fell by 8.9 per cent. Mr Stephen Hughes, Spanish analyst at Nikko Europe, believes that the fall in the Madrid stock market, fuelled by macro-economic fears and financial problems at some well-known companies, has been exaggerated. He is cautious of the market in the next quarter, because of the general uncertainty about the direction of global stock markets over the summer. However, he recommends picking up stocks on a 12-month view. Italy was paralysed by the lack of a government until the end of the quarter; but repeated breakdowns in Milan's new electronic trading system, blamed on thunder storms, have also deterred fresh investment, sending the Comit index to a low for the year. Goldman Sachs says the short-term outlook for the market depends largely on the prospects for budgetary control and electoral reform. 'If the politicians begin to put their house in order, this could lead to a sustained re-rating of Italian equities,' the broker adds.</p>

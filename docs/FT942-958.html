			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Business Travel (Update): Russian crime guide The Russian government has issued a 'survival guide' for foreigners on how to avoid crime, warning them not to deal with shady businessmen and not to accept lifts or drinks from strangers. The interior ministry said in a pocket-sized guide, which will be sent to embassies, that almost half the 5,000 offences against foreigners uncovered over the last year were the result of carelessness. Last year, 63 foreigners were murdered. In the first five months of this year, when citizens of former Soviet republics were included, 65 were killed.</p>

			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Construction Contracts: Pounds 31.5m Black Country route MILLER CIVIL ENGINEERING, a member of the Miller Group, has won contracts with a total value of nearly Pounds 46.5m. The largest is for the first phase of the Black Country route (pictured right), a 2.7 kilometres dual carriageway joining Darlaston Lane in Walsall to Junction 10 of the M6. The contract, let by Walsall Metropolitan Council, was won in competition at Pounds 31.5m. Considerable ground treatment is involved, including the infilling of old mine workings and the removal of some contaminated land. Within this stretch of the route there are two main interchanges, two overbridges, five underbridges and a diversion culvert for the Darlaston Brook. Within the structures Miller will use 14,000 cu metres of concrete, 3,000 tonnes of reinforcing steel and 750 tonnes of structural steel. Also included in the work are 14 reinforced earth retaining walls and 10 crib walls involving 6,200 sq metres of brick faced panels, 150,000 cu metres of backfill and 220,000 sq metres of geotextile reinforcing. The road will require 480,000 cu metres of imported material and 85,000 sq metres of black top. The contract is due to take 130 weeks and starts at the end of April. In the north west at Dalton in Furness, Miller has started work on the new bypass for the Department of Transport, a contract valued at Pounds 8m and lasting 94 weeks. This bypass project comprises 3.5 kilometres of 10 metre wide single carriageway, with three overbridges, three roundabouts and a box culvert, and geotechnical work.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Beatriz Abreu] </F>   [Text] Belo Horizonte -- Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero  yesterday admitted that the government will adopt a fixed  exchange rate between the real and the dollar and the other  international hard currencies for an undetermined period of  time. Ricupero said that the government can maintain a stable  exchange rate because its exchange reserves amount to "much more  than $30 billion" and he does not believe in reducing the  profitability of exports. Ricupero said: "Most exporters are  already closing future exchange deals [contracts through banks  by which payment is received ahead of the actual export  operation]." He added: "They prepare a cushion months ahead."    Ricupero did not say how long the government expects to  maintain a "stable" exchange rate--given that he does not want  to admit that the exchange policy to be adopted with the  implementation of the real is based on freezing the exchange  rate. He said: "It is as the poem says: Let it not be eternal  but infinite as long as it lasts," quoting the Fidelity Sonnet  of [Brazilian poet] Vinicius de Moraes. An economic team member  has admitted that the URV [Real Value Unit] on 30 June will  equal 1 real on 1 July. From then on parity with the real will  not change. According to economic team projections, the URV on  30 June will be equivalent to 2,614.12 real cruzeiros.    Ricupero said that he recently spoke with former Finance  Minister Delfim Netto who expressed support for the "clever  plan." Ricupero said Delfim told him he had tried to adopt the  same program when he was a minister but was unable because the  country then faced serious exchange problems. Ricupero stated:  "Delfim said he needed $1 billion to establish parity between  the dollar and the ORTN [National Readjustable Treasury Bonds],  but the IMF refused to lend him the money."    The minister said the government is alert to eventual  problems with the exchange lag. He said something "which has  become a cliche:" He said: "Exporters always demand a 30-percent  exchange lag." He revealed that he will negotiate with [state]  governors the elimination of taxes on exports. He stated:  "Negotiation is difficult, but we will try to lift the burden on  exporters and convince the governors that with price stability,  other tax revenues will increase."    Regarding salaries, the finance minister said he will not  allow businessmen to pay for eventual wage increases with price  increases. "We will negotiate case by case, like with the car  industry." He said the salary mass dropped by 10 percent in real  terms during the first few months of this year.    The minister said he is worried over increased consumption.  "There might be a problem with durable goods sales because they  already increased by 40 percent," he said. "If this trend is  confirmed we will have to adopt further measures, but in general  we do not believe in a consumption explosion because only 74  percent of the industrial capability is working."</p>

			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Constitutional reform a step closer in Russia RUSSIA nudged a little closer to its goal of becoming a law-based state yesterday when its constitutional convention approved by a large majority a draft constitution setting out the fundamentals of a democratic country based on market principles. Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, said that 'it's now clear that without a principled resolution of the constitutional problem further progress on economic reform is simply impossible in principle'. The document, which runs to 133 articles, now passes for further revision to the assemblies of the regions and republics across Russia - a sure recipe, as Mr Yeltsin tacitly acknowledged, for further delay and extensive revision. The redrafted document is unlikely to be ready by Mr Yeltsin's target date of early August for approval by the convention. At least a third of the representatives from the regions and the republics - who were the dominant force in the constitutional convention - did not initial the document, and even those who did made it clear that their parliaments were free to revise the document radically. Mr Victor Stepanov, head of the Karelia republic, said: 'We'll take at least two months to go through this properly and there are many things we don't like in it.' Mr Yeltsin, in his speech to the convention, said that the new phenomenon of 'republicanisation' - regions naming themselves republics in order to qualify for greater privileges under the new constitution - was a futile exercise because, under the constitution, regions and republic had equal rights. This, however, is itself a further cause of difficulty since the republics, traditionally favoured in the Soviet system, wish to preserve their differential privilege. The draft constitution gives a number of concessions to the regions - giving them the right to have their own 'charter' as an antidote to their complaint that republics have the right to a constitution. They also have the right to promulgate new laws - though, as Mr Yeltsin noted, the tax regime is still undefined between the centre and the regions and republics. The draft also allows regions and republics to sign separate treaties on bilateral relations with Moscow - a clause inserted at the insistence of the Tatar republic, the most powerful and independent-minded of all the subjects of the federation. Under the existing constitution, the draft will eventually need to cross the hurdle of being approved by the existing parliament, which is an unlikely prospect. The president's advisers now seem inclined to propose that the convention pass a law on elections - a law which would allow elections later this year to a new form of parliament which would then adopt the constitution.</p>

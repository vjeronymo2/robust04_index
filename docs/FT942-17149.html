			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Survey of Business in Dorset (2): County at a crossroads - The Prospects have improved - Economic development 'We are feeling a little bit more optimistic about the economy. You hear better noises from people,' says Mr John Morrison, chief executive of Dorset Training and Enterprise Council. While prospects for Dorset's economy have improved compared with the depths of the recession, the optimism is guarded. Although unemployment in February at 10.1 per cent was below the peak, it compares with a rate of only 3.2 per cent in 1990. From that low base, it accelerated to reach 10.9 per cent in January 1993. This increase of 241 per cent was easily the highest in south-west England. An analysis last month of corporate profitability by Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information company, ranked Bournemouth as the least profitable town in Britain. Within the Bournemouth area, nearly 14,000 people were out of work in December; almost half the county's total unemployed. Soaring unemployment was the catalyst for the public and private sectors to set up the Partners for Prosperity forum. Backed by the county council, Dorset Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry and Training and Enterprise Council, it intends to lobby for the county, market its opportunities and encourage initiatives to regenerate the economy. Mr Tony Ward, chief executive of Partners for Prosperity, says an important role is information. 'It is vital to know what we have to offer and the potential. We have to market the Dorset brand - to get it across that Dorset is a good place to come to bring your company here.' Within the county, people also have to be persuaded. 'We have to make sure that people in Dorset think economic development is a good thing. We have to demonstrate there can be added value to the environment from economic development, rather than detracting from it.' The partnership needs, Mr Ward says, to put up 'cogent arguments' in lobbying the government and European Union for assistance. While the county failed in December to win European structural funds, the Weymouth and Portland area, hard hit by the defence run-down, has gained some European Konver funding and intermediate assisted area status. Part of west Dorset was designated a rural development area in 1984 and from April 1 much more of the county is included in an expanded area. The weakness of the rural economy is shown by a survey in 1991 which found that Dorset parishes were the worst off in southern England for services. Half had no permanent shop, post office or pub and nearly three quarters were without a school. One fifth had no bus service. Mr Rex Symons, chairman of Dorset Tec, says: 'If we are to preserve the somewhat unique heritage in the west and north, it has to be a working community, not a museum. If we could achieve increased rural activity without destructive development, we would achieve a major breakthrough.' Gillingham, in the rural north, is one town which has decided, together with North Dorset district council, that it must attract investment. Land has been earmarked for development and it believes it offers a good location: the US company Aldrich Chemicals, which employs 100 people there, is investing in expansion. The town council says the decision to develop an industrial and commercial centre was taken in the knowledge that 'the population are in agreement that this is the most practical way to secure its future prosperity.' The economic powerhouse of the region, however, is anchored in the conurbation around Bournemouth and Poole, where the mainstay industries of manufacturing, financial services and tourism have suffered in the recession. But Goadsby &amp; Harding, a leading independent estate agency, believes this year will see the beginning of speculative office development, triggered by increasing inquiries and the lack of prime new office property. It reports 'significant shortages of large, modern specification buildings' in south-east Dorset. This indicates the local economy is not all a tale of retrenchment. At Poole, Surface Electronics, a manufacturer which employs 350 people, moved to its existing factory in March 1993 but has already outgrown the premises and wants another unit alongside. The county council, in drawing up its structure plan, identifies land supply as an important factor if Dorset is to be a competitive location for inward investment. But Mr Roger Woolley, business development partner of Lester Aldridge, a leading regional law firm, considers that while local authorities are no longer negative about economic development, they still lack dynamism. 'We don't have a gut feeling there is the political will to make it happen,' he says. There would need to be only relatively modest growth to see a shortage of development land. Dorset has few large development sites. One with the biggest potential is at Bournemouth airport, and another is Winfrith, where AEA Technology owns no fewer than 150 buildings. Its commercial reactor shut down in 1990 but there are still more than 1,000 people employed on decommissioning, research and consultancy work. It is keen to sell its services for other uses - for example, in simulations for the oil industry. Mr David Kirby, head of property for AEA Technology, is seeking to develop Winfrith as a technology park, attracting like-minded businesses. Last month, agreement was reached for Defence Research Agency's Underwater Systems to move from Portland to Winfrith. In encouraging inward investors, Mr Len Carslake, the county's economic development officer, describes the 'stability and quality of the workforce' as one of the great resources of the county. A double-edged factor is that wage levels in the county are among the lowest in England. While this may appeal to some companies, it also means that, as the economy improves, it may be difficult to keep the best staff. To counter that is the quality of life, which is Dorset's greatest asset. Mr Woolley says: 'We recruit a lot of lawyers from London. It is very difficult to get them to come, but once here, they are almost immediately sold on it.'</p>

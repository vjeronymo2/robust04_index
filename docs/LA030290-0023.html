			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> FISHING;  </P> <P> SAN PEDRO ANGLER GETS HOOKED ON FISHING FROM TUBE  </P> <P> It all started in a back-yard swimming pool for 23-year-old float tube  fisherman Marcus Larson of San Pedro.  </P> <P> After watching and talking with float tube anglers at South Bay beaches, he  decided to give it a try.  </P> <P> He outfitted himself with a float tube that goes around the body's midsection,  a jacket with pockets and a pair of flippers for propulsion.  </P> <P> After months of practice in a pool, Larson headed to the beaches to fish the  surf. Now he is a veteran of five years of float fishing.  </P> <P> Last weekend Larson loaded his pockets with sand crabs and some cut squid and  paddled about a half-mile out in calm surf near Manhattan Beach.  </P> <P> He rigged his rod with eight-pound test and peeled out his line. He got  continuous strikes on his bait, but each time the crabs were taken.  </P> <P> Larson said he was sure it was a halibut, as he saw a fish spit the hook out  when it came to the surface.  </P> <P> He pushed out one more time against the current, baited with squid and had a  bite. He set the hook, and sure that the fish was hooked securely, paddled back  to shore with a flattie.  </P> <P> The fish weighed eight pounds. Larson was careful not to injure the fish and  released it.  </P> <P> Larson said float tubers must use caution and not go out when the surf is high  or the current is strong.  </P> <P> Larson said someday he would like to try fishing from a surfboard.  </P> <P> Dan Armstrong of Redondo Beach returned last weekend from fishing for steelhead  at Redwood Creek in Northern California. Armstrong said he caught four that  weighed six to 10 pounds.  </P> <P> At the 44th annual Fred Hall Tackle Show at the Long Beach Convention Center  this Saturday, a lucky boy or girl is expected to land the show's 300,000th  trout and will be rewarded with fishing equipment.  </P> <P> South Bay Catches:  </P> <P> Kelly Anderson of Long Beach, fishing at Cherry Bank aboard the Toronado, used  a squid-baited jig and landed the whopper of the week, a 27-pound cow cod.  </P> <P> Howard Hata of West Los Angeles, fishing aboard the Mustang, won the jackpot  with a 23-pound yellowtail.  </P> <P> Lou Spero of Long Beach, fishing at Catalina Island aboard the Southern Cal,  won the jackpot with a 22-pound lingcod.  </P> <P> David Summers of Wilmington, fishing at Catalina aboard the Hitless Miss,  caught a 20-pound cow cod.  </P> <P> Gary Shiroishi of West Los Angeles, fishing aboard the Blackjack at the Cherry  Bank, caught a 19-pound cow cod.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> FROM PERFECTION TO REJECTION;  </P> <P> VOLLEYBALL: MIRA COSTA HIGH WAS THE NATIONAL CHAMPION LAST SEASON, BUT WITH  ONLY ONE STARTER RETURNING, IT IS NOT GETTING ANY RESPECT IN A NATIONAL  PRESEASON POLL.  </P> <P> These things go in cycles. Dae Lea Aldrich, girls' volleyball coach at Mira  Costa High, knows it better than most.  </P> <P> Only a year removed from a 27-0 season that left Mira Costa at the top of the  prep volleyball world -- with No. 1 national rankings in both Volleyball  Monthly and USA Today -- Aldrich finds herself back at the beginning of the  spiral.  </P> <P> Only one starter returns from last year's unbeaten squad. Only three of  Aldrich's starters are seniors.  </P> <P> Mira Costa is nowhere to be found in USA Today's Top 25 poll this month. And  the Mustangs are ranked only sixth in the Southern Section by Volleyball  Monthly.  </P> <P> But in the preseason Southern Section coaches' poll, Mira Costa was ranked  first in the 5-A Division.  </P> <P> Apparently the Southland's coaches still believe in Mira Costa, even if Aldrich  is hedging her bets a little.  </P> <P> "I don't think we're going to fall apart or anything," Aldrich said. "But if  we're lucky, we'll make the (CIF) quarterfinals. If we're luckier still, we'll  make the semis. And if we've really got it all going for us, maybe we'll make  it into the finals."  </P> <P> At the center of Mira Costa's rebuilding effort is setter Robin Ortgiesen. She  was the only junior on the team that steamrollered every opponent all the way  through last year's State Division I championships.  </P> <P> Ortgiesen, the team's captain, is counted on to provide stability and  leadership.  </P> <P> "Robin is big and she can lead, and she's got to get everything going for us,"  Aldrich said. "She's directing the traffic for us. She's our quarterback."  </P> <P> Two other seniors -- middle blocker Jen Smith and outside hitter Cindy  DeGarceau -- are also veterans of Mira Costa's flawless 1989 squad. Smith was  Aldrich's first reserve off the bench last year, and DeGarceau is finally  getting her chance to start after waiting in the wings.  </P> <P> But after that trio of seniors, Aldrich is leading some inexperienced  reinforcements. Outside hitter Shannon Park is a junior, and middle blocker Ann  Windes and outside hitter Shawnee Hayes are sophomores.  </P> <P> "They are young, green kids, but they're talented," Aldrich said. "They need  time to grow, and this is going to be their growing year. But they're young and  fiery, and they're not afraid to make mistakes."  </P> <P> Last year, Aldrich had the luxury of bringing in Smith or defensive specialist  Jen Streatfield off the bench. This season, Aldrich said, her reserves are a  little thin.  </P> <P> "They're just not there yet," she said. "Volleyball is a real reaction game,  and almost everything depends on second nature. It takes a while to develop the  kind of athleticism necessary to react like that."  </P> <P> They will have to learn in a hurry. Starting this weekend, Mira Costa plays in  three consecutive weekend tournaments where it will face the cream of Southern  California's volleyball crop.  </P> <P> In this weekend's Edison tournament, the Mustangs will go up against three  talented Orange County teams: Corona del Mar, Laguna Beach and Newport Harbor  -- any of which Aldrich feels is capable of winning the Southern Section  championship.  </P> <P> The following weekend, Mira Costa tangles with Corona del Mar again, as well as  powerhouse Santa Barbara, in the Redondo Power Classic. And on the weekend of  Oct. 6, the Mustangs will be among 25 teams in the San Marcos Tournament, the  state's most competitive event.  </P> <P> Traditionally, the eventual CIF champion comes from the San Marcos field of 25.  </P> <P> "We might get beat up a little bit, but it will be good for us," Aldrich said.  </P> <P> It was a victory over Corona del Mar in the finals of last year's Edison  tournament that launched Mira Costa on its unbeaten journey.  </P> <P> But the 1989 team had the marks of greatness long before that crucial match.  Six players from that team are now playing Division I college volleyball on  full-ride scholarships.  </P> <P> Piper Hahn, the team's setter and last year's CIF player of the year, is at  Stanford with Heidi Eick, a former Mira Costa middle blocker.  </P> <P> Middle blocker Krystal Attwood went on to the University of Hawaii, and outside  hitters Rainy Chrisman and Erika Lawson are at Pepperdine. Streatfield took her  tremendous jump serve to the University of Washington.  </P> <P> "It was an amazing group," Aldrich said. "But even that unit took a couple of  years to develop. They grew through the program together and they really  excelled. It takes years of practice as a team to learn to play at the speed  and level that those girls did."  </P> <P> Aldrich started coaching at Mira Costa in 1982 and has won seven Southern  Section and four state championships.  </P> <P> She spent the summer working as a private coach to beach professionals Elaine  Roque and Nina Matthies and watched that pair win the tour's most prestigious  event, the $50,000 World Championships in Laughlin, Nev.  </P> <P> This fall, however, Aldrich is concerned with more traditional pursuits.  </P> <P> So far, Mira Costa's youth movement has rung up a 2-0 record with non-league  victories over Bishop Montgomery and West Torrance.  </P> <P> "I don't want these kids to want recognition just because they play for Mira  Costa," Aldrich said. "Usually, just the name 'Mira Costa' is worth a couple of  points a match.  </P> <P> "But these girls have to set their own standards, and make their own mark. They  have to earn their own right to that name."  </P></p>

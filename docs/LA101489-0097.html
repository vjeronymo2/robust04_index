			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 4-YEAR TERM FOR MAYOR FACES PALMDALE VOTE  </P> <P> The Palmdale City Council has tentatively approved an April ballot measure  proposing to extend the mayor's two-year term to four years, even though voters  overwhelmingly rejected the same plan in 1986.  </P> <P> With little discussion, Palmdale lawmakers -- including Mayor William (Pete)  Knight -- voted 5 to 0 Thursday night to put the measure before voters in the  April 10 municipal election. The change requires a majority vote.  </P> <P> City Administrator Robert Toone Jr. said the longer term would provide more  continuity on the council. The mayor now faces reelection every two years, but  the four council members serve staggered four-year terms.  </P> <P> For years, voters in Palmdale simply elected five council members, who in turn  picked a mayor from their ranks. But in April, 1986, voters by a 70% margin  approved election of the mayor individually.  </P> <P> However, in the same election, voters opted by a 76% margin to give the mayor a  two-year term instead of four years.  </P> <P> Knight, a record-holding former Air Force test pilot who defeated three  challengers to become the first elected mayor in April, 1988, faces reelection  in April. Although some council members disagreed, City Atty. William Rudell  said the four-year term would take effect in April if approved by voters.  </P></p>

At a news conference in Johannesburg on Wednesday, ANC  officials admitted some SDUs had been infiltrated by  undisciplined elements, out to kill unit commanders and harass  communities. ANC PWV [Pretoria - Witwatersrand - Vereeniging]  General Secretary Oped Bapela said because the SDUs had been set  up by communities, they had not previously been accountable to  the ANC. But the time had come for the ANC to protect the  community by becoming directly involved in the units.    The ANC PWV regional office had stepped in as soon as it had  been alerted to continuous gunfire between SDU members of  Mavimbela and Ncala sections in Katlehong on the East Rand at  the weekend. There had been no similar occurences since Sunday,  Mr Bapela said.    He said the four deaths of SDU members and Umkhonto we Sizwe  [Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing -- MK] commanders last  week had been caused by malicious rumour-mongering and character  assassination of local leaders. Some SDU members had acted  emotionally without establishing facts.    Guidelines for SDU restructuring had been drawn up at an  urgent 10-hour meeting of the ANC, SA [South African] National  Civics Organisation, SA Communist Party, SDU commanders and  other involved parties on Tuesday. It had been agreed people  joining SDUs would be screened carefully and those not living in  the township should not be allowed to become involved.    For the first time, SDUs would have to be accountable to the  ANC, which would control their activities through a  newly-established monitoring committee. All fighting parties  agreed to a formal ceasefire and that the highly-charged  Mavimbela SDU would be disbanded temporarily during  investigations and restructuring, Mr Bapela said. He assured  the media the investigation into the deaths would be honest and  no incriminating facts would be swept under the carpet. He did  not rule out the possibility of handing suspects over to the  [words indistinct] Internal Stability Unit was withdrawn from  townships.</p>

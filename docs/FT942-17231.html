			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Arts: Never mind the broadcast quality - Television The number of new series arriving on television keeps on increasing as the number of channels grows and, more important, as series get shorter. Unfortunately, the amount of talent available remains static. In Britain, television used to rely on gifted people to come up with good programme ideas - so talent was crucial. American practice is far more hard-headed as the networks commission material from programme makers and impose tight quality control. If you do not get a gag a minute into your situation comedy, then somebody else will: talent - schmalent] You work to a formula designed to achieve a given rating and if you fail there are plenty of wannabes behind you. Although there is still much talented material on British television, more and more broadcasters seem to be setting off down the American road. Take the BBC1 series Do The Right Thing, now screened on Saturday nights. We are told that it is made under licence from Brazil, where the idea of viewers phoning in to vote on the moral conundrums in a brief soap drama is a huge success. Whatever its origins, there is no mistaking that the British version is in several respects a hybrid. It is like a cross between Blankety Blank and the Ten Commandments. Presenter Terry Wogan wanders around, joshing (I think that is the word) with a panel of minor 'celebrities', just as he did on Blankety Blank. But this time he is asking ethical questions in the hope of getting a funny answer. This is more or less ensured because the only resident panellist, Frank Skinner, is a comedian. At several stages in the filmed vignette the studio audience is invited to 'vote with your feet', taking 'Yes' seats to the left and 'No' seats to the right. Should the man have an affair with his stepdaughter? Vote with your feet (and please mill about in the middle or it looks very unexciting). At the end of the story viewers are urged to phone in and vote. Thus the show manages to combine all of television's favourite populist forms: soap opera, quiz, comedy and chat show, with a phone-in thrown in. It is hard to imagine anything working more assiduously to a formula. Do The Right Thing reduces moral problems to the level of mindless gags, and if the BBC really suggests that this is part of the 'Himalayan option' - the high ground of broadcasting which they claim to be seeking - then heaven preserve us from the lowlands. Of course the prescriptive system can work, if by 'work' you mean achieving a consistent level of entertainment and a given rating. Many formula-based American series are impressive, from M*A*S*H* and Cheers to Donahue and Columbo. Nor is creation to a strict precept a guarantee of poor quality in British television. BBC1's newish Sunday evening comedy Ain't Misbehavin' takes Peter Davison, who was so good as one of the adulterers in A Very Peculiar Practice, Nicola Pagett who was so good as one of the adulterers in A Bit Of A Do, and teams them up as two sides in an adultery parallelogram. To be precise adultery has not yet been achieved, but that is what the series is all about, and since the writer is Roy (Last Of The Summer Wine, Open All Hours) Clarke, the absence of adultery is funnier than its presence. It would be no great surprise if the wronged partners became the first to do the deed. ITV's newish Thursday comedy, Outside Edge, is even more of a known quantity, having started life as a stage play and then been adapted as a television drama. Author Richard Harris is now proving that with a little stretching and augmentation his material - primarily two couples involved in a scratch cricket team - can make a highly entertaining series. It lacks the drive and inventiveness of a Fawlty Towers but the characterisation (the Dervishes played by Robert Daws and Brenda Blethyn: 'Look, love you Miriam, fair enough? Okay, fine', and the Costellos played by Josie Lawrence and Timothy Spall: 'Dontcha just love him? I'm gonna give him a right seein' to when I get him home') is splendidly enjoyable. The awful fact is that not only does the formula system often produce entertaining material, but talent, even in people who do have good ideas, can often go wrong. The series now running on Friday evenings on BBC2, From A To B: Tales Of Modern Motoring, is made by Nicholas Barker, following his weird series about domestic taste, Signs Of The Times. There is a formula of sorts behind both these series, but it is entirely Mr Barker's. In the motoring programmes we again have striking photography, interviewees speaking to camera so fluently that they sound rehearsed, conversations which are as artificial as dialogue in a play, with participants waiting for one another to stop before they speak, and technically astounding footage. Goodness knows where some of the camera mountings have been for the in-car sequences. The trouble is that with no reporter or even voice-over we have no way of knowing whether we should take this seriously or - as I suspect - treat it largely as a piece of tongue-in-cheek fiction. The most striking example of the non-American approach in the past week, however, was Curse Of The Firebeetle in the brief Arena Relics series. Here was a truly individual vision if ever there was one: an account of a man trying to carry the giant shield of Atahualpa, the sun god, across a forbidding landscape to Lima, all shot as a pastiche spaghetti western. The pastiche was superb, with striking compositions of man, man-made object and landscape that were often better than the originals by Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood. If there is an Oscar for location finding this film should win it hands down; the Bolivian scenes (standing in for Peru) in mountain and desert were quite astounding. The trouble was that what little story we got was thin and unlikely, and writer/director Paul Gruebel Lee clearly had nothing else to say. He was just knocked out by the mise-en-scene. Successful non-formula programmes by talented people are few and far between and, as more television channels demand increasing quantities of 'product', they will seem even fewer and further between. They will, however, continue to set the standard by which everything else is judged.</p>

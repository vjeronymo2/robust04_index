			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> B. Suction Dredging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The BMPs are required pursuant to 40 CFR 122.44(k)(3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Dredging is permitted only in the active stream channel where the dredging spoils are relatively clean and will cause minimum turbidity when returned to the stream. The material that runs through a suction dredge flows downstream and settles among gravel and rocks in the streambed. Too much silt and sand make it difficult for the salmon to dig suitable gravel nests (redds) and can also smother fish eggs already deposited.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Wherever practicable, the dredge shall be set to discharge into a quiet pool where settling of dredge spoils can occur more rapidly. This will cause in-stream turbidity to be minimized and localized to the general area of the dredging activity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The purpose of this requirement is to control the potential discharge of pollutants, resulting from fuel spills, from entering receiving waters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Dredging is not permitted during the periods that fish eggs could be in the gravel at the dredge site. The greatest single effect a suction dredge has on the environment is the danger it poses to fish. The dredge pump forces water and gravel through the nozzle and hose. Fish eggs taken up with gravel cannot survive the shock, pressure, and battering and pounding that comes with moving through the hose and sluice. If a fish egg should somehow survive the hose and sluice, the chances for being buried in the gravel at the right depth and in the correct gravel composition necessary for incubation are nonexistent. ``The Atlas to the Catalog of Waters Important for Spawning, Rearing or Migration of Anadromous Fish'' lists the streams in the State which require a Habitat permit from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. This catalog is quite extensive but is available for viewing at many agencies including Alaska Department of Fish and Game, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Anchorage Operations Office of EPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> VI.

Spill Prevention Control and Containment (SPCC) Plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Part III.C. of the proposed permit was established in accordance with 40 CFR 122.44(k)(3). The purpose of this requirement is to control the potential discharge of pollutants, resulting from fuel spills, from entering receiving waters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> B. Endangered Species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A species list was provided by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for the state of Alaska. The recommended protection measures for the species of concern during the nesting period prohibits alterations of limited, high quality habitat which could detrimentally and significantly reduce prey availability. Since this general water discharge permit is written to protect aquatic life or human health criteria (whichever is more stringent), no alterations of habitat due to water discharges authorized by this permit should occur. Because of this, EPA has determined that formal consultation for section 7 of the Endangered Species Act is not necessary for existing facilities. Environmental Assessments will be completed for each new source discharge as is stated in Part I.A.3. of the permit. Any consultation necessary to comply with the Endangered Species Act will be performed at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> VII. Storm Exemption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Part III.D. of the proposed permit establishes a storm exemption provision which authorizes exceedences of technology-based effluent limitations and standards provided that the permittee meets certain design and operational criteria. This provision is required pursuant to 40 CFR 440.141(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This provision allows for the unavoidable exceedence of technology-based effluent limitations during storms of intensity greater than or equal to a 5-year, 6-hour storm event. The storm exemption will be allowed provided that (1) the settling ponds are designed, constructed, and maintained to contain the volume of process water generated during four hours of normal operation plus the drainage water resulting from a 5-year, 6-hour storm event, (2) the operator takes all reasonable steps possible to maintain treatment of the wastewater and minimize overflow from the settling ponds, (3) the permittee must be in compliance with the BMPs in Part III.A. of the proposed permit, and (4) the operator complies with all the notification requirements for bypasses and upsets as established in Parts III.G. and H. of the proposed permit. Part III.D. of the proposed permit establishes the specific conditions which must be met in order to be eligible for the storm exemption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This exemption is designed to provide an affirmative defense to an enforcement action. Therefore, the operator has the burden of demonstrating to the appropriate authority that the above conditions have been met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> VIII.

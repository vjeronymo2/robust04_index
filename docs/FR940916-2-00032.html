CP82&hyph;384&hyph;000 and CP82&hyph;384&hyph;001 pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NGT proposes to abandon in place and transfer by sale to Arkla: (1) Line B consisting of 16,550 feet of 10-inch pipe from pipeline station 3349+50 to 3515+00; (2) Line BM&hyph;9 consisting of 8,725 feet of 4-inch pipe from pipeline station 0+00 to 87+25; (3) the entire Line BM&hyph;6 consisting of 216 feet of 4-inch pipe, and (4) 17 rural domestic taps (16 on BM&hyph;9 and 1 on BM&hyph;6). NGT will continue to operate the remaining portion of Line B (476,720 feet) and Line BM&hyph;9 (10,303 feet). NGT states that these facilities will be abandoned as a result of a segment rerouting of Line B. The rerouting, pursuant to Section 157.208(a), is necessary due to residential encroachment caused by the City of Russellville, Arkansas annexing land for future development. Lines BM&hyph;9 and BM&hyph;6 currently provide service to Arkla's existing distribution system and are connected to the Line B portion that will be abandoned after the rerouting is completed. The rerouting of Line B will parallel a portion of NGT's existing Line BM&hyph;9 and interconnect with Line BM&hyph;9 at approximately station 87+25. Line BM&hyph;6 will not interconnect with the rerouted portion of Line B. Arkla will use the acquired facilities as part of its existing low pressure distribution system. NGT states that no customers or services will be terminated with this abandonment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment date: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  October 24, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 7.

It is asserted that West Florida has requested the relocation and will reimburse FGT for all direct and indirect costs. FGT estimates the cost of the relocation at $63,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is asserted that the relocation will allow a greater hourly flow through the meter station and give West Florida the economic ability to loop the Ocala North Lateral to utilize their existing certificated capacity. It is stated that the relocation will permit the delivery of up to 300 MMBtu of natural gas per hour to West Florida. It is asserted that the relocation of facilities will not result in any change in the daily or annual quantities that FGT is authorized to deliver to West Florida. FGT states that it has sufficient capacity to accomplish the deliveries at the relocated meter station without detriment or disadvantage to any of FGT's other customers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment date: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  October 24, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Standard Paragraphs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> F.

			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Survey of North American Free Trade (1): Problems to be resolved - Nafta supporters reckon the economies of the US, Canada and Mexico will all benefit from the treaty. Studies indicate a 'win-win-win situation', says one expert. Yet there will also be losers in the process of economic restructuring SINCE the North American Free Trade Agreement was signed by the leaders of the US, Canada and Mexico last October, the political landscape of the region has changed. President George Bush, one of the accord's great supporters, is no longer in the White House and Mr Brian Mulroney, Canada's prime minister, has announced his intention to step down this year. The Mexican president, Mr Carlos Salinas, is still in place, his great initiative to integrate the Mexican economy with its powerful northern neighbours now in the hands of a Democrat-controlled US Congress. As a result, the Mexican economy and political system is in a state of great uncertainty. Mr Salinas wants the treaty, which brings together three countries responsible for more than 18 per cent of world trade, ratified this year. For him, it will set in stone the market-oriented economic policies he has pursued since assuming office in 1988. He hopes that the boost in economic confidence that will ensue will pave the way for the election of his party's presidential candidate in the 1994 election. Nafta - the first reciprocal trade treaty between developed and developing countries - provides for the gradual ending over 10 years of tariffs and most other barriers to trade between Canada, Mexico and the US. Tariffs on some goods, such as agricultural products, will be phased out over 15 years. It extends to Mexico trade dispute settlement procedures established by the existing US-Canadian free trade agreement. It lays out commitments on the treatment of services and investment and opens industries such as Mexico's petrochemicals and financial services sectors. From the viewpoint of economic efficiency, the negotiations which concluded last year worked out better than many trade experts had predicted. But some sections have been criticised. Basic energy, for example, has been excluded from the agreement at Mexico's insistence. In the words of Mr Gary Hufbauer and Mr Jeffrey Schott of the Washington-based Institute for International Economics, a 'schizophrenic' regime has been established in textiles and clothing. They say origin rules for textiles and vehicle production force regional producers to source from less efficient suppliers within the region. Supporters reckon that nonetheless all three economies will benefit from the treaty. According to Ms Nora Lustig of the Brookings Institution, most studies 'indicate that there will be a win-win-win situation for the three countries.' This expectation is partly derived from the assumption that wage differences will lead to a mutually-beneficial division of labour: labour-intensive industry requiring fewer skills would migrate to Mexico while capital-intensive, highly-skilled work will concentrate in the US and Canada. There is little disagreement that Mexico has most to gain. Mexico does about three-quarters of its trade with the US; its economy is a 20th of the size of the US and half that of Canada. Yet Mexico is of increasing significance to the other two economies. It is already a Dollars 40bn-plus export market for US goods, accounting for nearly 10 per cent of US exports, and it is a growing potential market for Canada. Canadian exporters presently sell less than Dollars 1bn worth of products annually to Mexico, but Ottawa's interest in protecting the gains made in its bilateral free trade accord and in ensuring its continued importance to foreign investors looking at the North American market led it to support the accord. The main economic benefits to Mexico may, however, come from increased capital inflows - and therefore the higher investment - that should be sustainable once the Nafta goes into effect. Nafta proponents argue that the benefits from the US point of view may not be only, or even mainly, economic. The agreement would fix an outward, pro-Washington orientation in Mexican foreign policy, traditionally antagonistic to the US. Economic growth would also provide stability in Mexico, better place it to address mutual environmental concerns and over time reduce illegal immigration to the US, which reached a record high last year. Yet there will unavoidably be some losers. In the process of economic restructuring, companies in all three countries will close factories and many thousands of people will lose their jobs. Ms Lustig says that because the Bush administration had seen the overall economic impact of Nafta as positive, it had glossed over the problems of the losers in the US. By contrast, the Clinton administration has decided to address these concerns. This has turned out to be important in any case to secure congressional passage for the treaty over an increasingly vociferous opposition. While opposition encompasses environmentalists and those with political concerns about Mexico's one-party rule, its most powerful US opponents - including Mr Ross Perot, the former presidential candidate - are worried about US job losses as companies are sucked southwards to exploit cheap Mexican labour. The idea that imports produced by cheap foreign labour will reduce standards of living in the US resurrects a notion almost as old as economics itself. The reality is a bit more complicated: US workers get paid more because they are more productive. Most of the Nafta losers in the US can be helped unilaterally by the US  - through support and training for displaced workers, for example. Backing for a North American development bank to iron out economic dislocation within Nafta also appears to be gaining momentum on Capitol Hill. The president has also insisted on supplemental agreements, now being negotiated trilaterally, over labour standards and the environment. The aim is to make sure that migration by companies, and therefore jobs, from the US to Mexico does not take place merely to take advantage of lax enforcement of Mexican labour and environmental laws. The side accords foresee supranational commissions to investigate disputes. These side agreements have presented the US administration with a dilemma. It has recognised that the commissions have important implications for US sovereignty as well as Mexico's. The greater their powers, the more likely they are to be used against the US. Furthermore, to the extent that the side agreements are effective in addressing concerns of environmentalists and trade unions in the US, they will dilute some of the economic gains that Mexico expects to derive from the agreement. There are worries among Nafta supporters that the jobs and environment issues have become little more than a respectable cloak for the protectionist instincts of those who want to see the treaty killed. Reports from the negotiators, however, have suggested they are making important advances toward agreement. For the Mexican government, the side agreements have extended the agony surrounding ratification. President Salinas has staked its prestige and economic policy on Nafta, which is important in ensuring the continuation of the government's economic reforms. In the shorter term, it is needed to provide confidence that a current account deficit which reached Dollars 22.8bn last year can be financed. Mexico's financial markets are in thrall to day-to-day signals on prospects for ratification by the US Congress, a state of affairs that will prevail until the treaty is voted on by the US Congress, which could be as late as December. According to Mr Peter Hakim of the Washington-based InterAmerican Dialogue, the US administration has been pushed on the defensive over Nafta because it is fighting on the turf of the treaty's opponents over the labour and environment issues. If the administration wants to secure passage, it should go on the offensive, presenting Nafta for example as part of its overall economic strategy. The treaty is not yet a legislative priority for the administration. Although he continues to insist that the treaty will be ratified in time for implementation at the beginning of 1994, Mr Clinton is unwilling yet to risk political capital which may be more usefully employed elsewhere. Mr Hakim and others believe that, once the side accords are secured, Mr Clinton has the ability, if he wants, to win ratification. 'It'll pass if Clinton gets involved and shows leadership; it will not pass of its own accord,' said Mr Mark Falcoff of the American Enterprise Institute in Washington.</p>

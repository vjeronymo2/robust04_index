			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COSTA MESA POLICY COULD SPUR EASING OF INS LAWS  </P> <P> Calling a Costa Mesa funding policy concerning aliens "a blessing in disguise .  . . because it alerted everybody to the absurdity" of immigration restrictions,  Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp told city officials and  national Latino rights advocates Wednesday that he will ask Congress to amend  provisions of the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act.  </P> <P> Kemp called a meeting with officials from Orange County to talk about the  national implications of the Costa Mesa policy. Later, as he was leaving to  brief White House officials, Kemp said he believes President Bush shares his  concern over what the secretary considers inequities in the way the federal  government provides aid to immigrants, both legal and illegal.  </P> <P> "The Bush Administration is committed to making sure that laws are not applied  in such a way that they are discriminatory -- and the way immigration laws are  currently working, there is blatant discrimination," Kemp said.  </P> <P> The White House issued no statements about Kemp's meeting or whether the  President will support attempts to modify current immigration laws.  </P> <P> The Costa Mesa policy -- adopted last August and subsequently rescinded --  would have denied federal grants administered by the city to public service  groups unless they agreed to exclude illegal aliens from their programs.  </P> <P> Kemp said that he expects wide support for easing immigration restrictions  "once people get a sense of how counter-productive and counter-intuitive the  laws are in their treatment of people."  </P> <P> "What we are trying to do is fashion a ruling that lets the (Immigration and  Naturalization Service) be responsible for borders . . . and does not require  that social service groups be agents of the federal government," he added.  </P> <P> Last week, Kemp suspended a ruling issued by his general counsel that supported  the Costa Mesa policy. The official held that the policy did not appear to  violate federal anti-discrimination guidelines. Kemp also stayed HUD  regulations that took effect on June 1 that prohibited immigrants who have been  granted temporary residency from benefiting from some HUD assistance programs  for five years.  </P> <P> Kemp said he was concerned about the inconsistencies that, for example, barred  a legal resident from receiving child care or a job under HUD-funded community  development block grant programs but allowed such benefits under other federal  assistance programs.  </P> <P> He also said he was concerned that the Costa Mesa measure could set a  precedent, with other cities attempting to enact similar restrictive funding  policies.  </P> <P> Rep. C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), who also attended Wednesday's  meeting, echoed those concerns and said "all participants agreed that cities  are not equipped to be INS enforcers."  </P> <P> "When enforcement guidelines are decided, they will be issued at the federal  level and will apply to all cities," he said.  </P> <P> Kemp and officials from Orange County will meet again to discuss specific  guidelines next Thursday.  </P> <P> Cox said that participants also agreed that emergency services "ought to be  treated separately."  </P> <P> "In the case of someone who is severly hurt and needs medical attention, do we  put them on hold while checking for their status?" he asked. "Yet, taking  current laws and regulations to their extreme, that is what would result."  </P> <P> Cox, who has supported modifying some immigration restrictions, said he will  move to enact some of the changes when Congress takes up another immigration  matter -- whether to increase quotas for lawful immigration -- in the next few  weeks.  </P> <P> "I think it would be germane to amend (immigration law) to include the kinds of  reforms that Kemp is asking for," he said.  </P> <P> Nativo Lopez, director of the Santa-Ana based Hermandad Mexicana Nacional, said  his group would support efforts to repeal immigration laws that deny benefits  to legal residents "either legislatively or administratively."  </P> <P> And Mario Moreno, a representative of the Mexican American Legal Defense and  Education Fund, said it is important that community groups not be made an arm  of the INS.  </P> <P> "Our concern is that the determination of legal status is not an easy thing  even for an expert," Moreno said. "It would be even more difficult to leave  that in the hands of someone -- like a receptionist -- who is not trained to  make that determination."  </P> <P> Costa Mesa Mayor Peter Buffa, who with City Manager Allan Roeder represented  the city, called the meeting "very productive." However, he voiced concern that  the city still has no clear-cut direction on whether it can require community  groups to adhere to immigration laws when providing services. The city has  approved applications for more than $114,000 in federal grants that are  scheduled to be distributed in October.  </P> <P> "Our objective is to have some kind of statement in place that refers to  compliance with federal immigration laws," Buffa said. "Exactly how that is  phrased is of great concern to HUD. We are hoping to come up with some mutually  agreeable language."  </P> <P> Costa Mesa's so-called anti-alien funding policy was passed last August amid  debate about growing numbers of illegal aliens entering the city.  </P> <P> City Councilman Orville Amburgey argued that undocumented aliens, including  large gatherings of dayworkers who had been congregating on city streets and in  parks, were attracted, in part, by free food, medical care and other assistance  offered by charitable groups in the city.  </P> <P> The policy was intended to restrict such services to legal residents or cut off  city funds to organizations that did not comply. But the plan outraged the  county's charitable and immigrant rights organizations as well as religious  leaders, who called the policy insensitive and impractical.  </P></p>

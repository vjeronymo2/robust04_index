			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HAVEL RECALLS A WAVE FROM AN OLD FOE  </P> <P> Seated next to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev amid the splendor and  formality of an official Kremlin dinner, Czechoslovakia's puckish new president  Vaclav Havel could not help recalling Monday that they had encountered one  another nearly three years ago under very different circumstances -- when  Gorbachev was visiting the Communist regime in Prague and Havel was a dissident  playwright.  </P> <P> "One evening when I was walking along the embankment (of the Charles River)  where we live in Prague, I saw a crowd of people walking past the National  Theater, and I went over to see what was happening," Havel recounted at a press  conference later.  </P> <P> "President Gorbachev had just attended a performance of the 'Bartered Bride' or  something else, and I saw him leaving the theater. I stood a few steps away  from him, and all of a sudden I found myself waving my hand at him. And, you  know, at that time, I was a dissident."  </P> <P> Not aware that Havel was, as the Soviet press described him as recently as six  months ago, an enemy of socialism and a troublemaker, Gorbachev waved back just  as spontaneously. The encounter so amused Havel that he wrote an essay on  "meeting" Gorbachev.  </P> <P> Gorbachev laughed at his story, Havel said, then recalled the 1987 trip in a  more serious vein.  </P> <P> "At that time, he did not feel good in Prague," Havel quoted Gorbachev as  telling him. "He felt the atmosphere was suffocating. He felt the tension  manifested to him and the hopes that were pinned on him. And he was aware that  this signaled a deep dissatisfaction of society with the regime then in the  country.  </P> <P> "I answered that, at that time, I was not too happy with the thrill (that)  people showed toward him. I believed this was in the Czech tradition of  expecting a savior to come from outside to protect us. I told him that, first  of all, we must save ourselves through our own efforts, and he fully agreed."  </P> <P> That trip -- bolstered by the advice of one of Gorbachev's most trusted aides,  Ivan T. Frolov, who had lived in Prague for a number of years -- contributed  significantly to the Kremlin's decision last autumn to withdraw its support  publicly from the Czechoslovak Communist Party leadership under former  President Gustav Husak, knowing that could bring its collapse.  </P> <P> Gorbachev, speaking with reporters Monday after agreements were signed laying  the basis for a "new relationship" between Moscow and Prague, described Havel  as "a man open to dialogue about all problems, a realist with a sense of the  future."  </P></p>

They flew there for various purposes  and with very dissimilar opportunities available to them, and  hence it is quite impossible to assess by the same yardstick the  success or failure of Ukraine's Leonid Kravchuk, Georgia's  Eduard Shevardnadze, and Russia's Ivan Rybkin.    This extreme closeness in time and space allows us to see  more clearly which of its interests -- and in what way -- the  last superpower is pursuing in that vast area that only recently  was unfriendly, and which today is no longer hostile, is not yet  friendly, and is -- it is not clear exactly what.    Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, who for a long time was  regarded in Washington as more or less persona non grata because  of his stubborn refusal to acknowledge the legality of  agreements on nuclear missile disarmament which he himself had  signed, wanted not only to make a good impression, but to win  the hearts of his sensitive hosts. That was why he took along  Olympic figure skating champion Oksana Bayul, in whose company  he went to the White House. This original idea proved  surprisingly inconvenient. President Clinton had been too busy  to meet with the Olympic champions among his own compatriots.  For the U.S. President to receive Oksana, albeit as one of a  state delegation, was a mistake which, ridiculous as it seems,  could cost him many votes.    The president of Ukraine, in whose territory, unfortunately,  there is not much oil or gas, has reached the point of needing  to trade in the only commodity he has which has export value:  Ukraine's geopolitical location. He told the Americans that a  strong and independent Ukraine could be an important buffer  against any expansionist urges on Russia's part.    In the absence of any clear laws on the protection of  foreign  capital, Kravchuk sought to entice businesspeople to try their  hands in the renewed Ukraine -- on the strength of his firm word  as president. The participants in the New York meetings raised  no objection aloud, but all the same they were thinking of L.  Kravchuk's remark to the effect that he does not intend to be a  candidate in the presidential elections to be held in the summer.    Politicians who are serving out their term without hope are  known in America as "lame ducks," or, as we would put it, winged  birds. This duality probably annoyed Kravchuk, who expressed  the view, at one press conference, that Ukraine has more  pressing matters on hand now than the presidential elections.    Eduard Shevardnadze, head of Georgia: cordial but imperious,  a little tired, but indefatigable, M.S. Gorbachev's loyal  associate, has been to Washington and to Andrews Air Base many  times.    Speaking on behalf of his country of 5.5 million people, he  performs miracles of inventiveness, keeping the diplomatic ball  in the air. While giving Russia, the Russians, and the CIS  their due, he put two requests to President Clinton.    The first, naturally, concerns money. The White House is  giving $100 million -- taking its possibilities to the limit.  "Let Shevardnadze ask Congress himself, he will do better (than  me)" -- President Clinton advised, half-joking, half-serious.    Shevardnadze's second request takes a larger view. The  Georgian leader asked the United States to send U.S. servicemen  to the border with Abkhazia as part of UN peace-making forces.    Clinton, naturally, refused. Point-blank. Whatever you do,  don't send Americans to fight God knows where and God knows what  for. But Shevardnadze is not the kind of person to take  champion sportswomen to meet the President. And nor was he  about to demand something from Clinton that the latter would  never do.    Shevardnadze wanted the U.S. President to lead a movement in  the United States for the sending of "Blue Helmets" to Georgia,  and he got what he wanted. Knowing very well that nothing is  going to happen in the Caucasus without Russia, Shevardnadze is  setting about the task of not excluding Russia, but ensuring  international monitoring of its necessary and inevitable  involvement in the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict. This kind of  monitoring is only possible if the United Nations takes on the  role of maintaining peace-making forces.    Ivan Rybkin, speaker of the Russian Duma, showed that the  communist devil is not as black as he is painted, because he is  no longer a communist at all, but a regular social democrat like  the ones in Sweden or Austria.    That is what many American newspapers said about the  chairman  of the State Duma, while the capital's WASHINGTON POST devoted  an enthusiastic article to him, by its Moscow correspondent,  describing the parliamentary speaker as a man who is capable, by  means of his calmness, of restoring many people's confidence in  his powers.    Describing the long walks to school by the little boy in the  countryside, and then his work on the kolkhoz, that newspaper  says that the 47-year-old former Volgograd Oblast CPSU Committee  secretary is most reminiscent of Abraham Lincoln, the celebrated  American president, who was a woodcutter in his youth.    The urbane, smiling speaker confidently denied charges that  his Agrarian Party harbors antireform sentiments, sought to  demonstrate that the Duma is ready and willing to cooperate with  the president, and, most important, reaffirmed again and again  his commitment to the foreign policy line which only recently  was seen as probably Andrey Kozyrev's most heinous crime -- the  line of partnership and cooperation with the United States.</p>

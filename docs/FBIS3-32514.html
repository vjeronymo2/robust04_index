The alleged objective of  this pirate office is to hamper the operations of the existing  Senate institution.    According to a note signed by Senator Firmin Jean-Louis,  steps already taken could at last lead to a denouement to the  crisis ravaging Haiti.    The Senate Office invites the country's institutions and the  entire Haitian people not to let themselves be led into any  adventurist maneuvers, which can only plunge the country even  further into the abyss and delay the process of setting up a new  government, returning to constitutional and democratic order,  lifting the embargo, and having the country move toward progress  once and for all.    The Senate Office takes this opportunity to announce to the  nation that a parliamentary delegation has gone abroad. The  delegation will meet with representatives of the United Nations,  the OAS, and the governments of the United States, Canada,  France, and Venezuela to explore ways and means of getting out  of the crisis quickly.    The communique adds: Furthermore, the Senate Office has  decided, pending the decision of the assembled Senate, to  suspend Senator Ebrane Cadet, Senate Office first secretary, who  has destroyed his reputation vis-a-vis the population through  his undisciplined and dangerous behavior toward the institution.    The Office of the Senate of the Republic firmly believes  that  the results of the multiple steps being taken abroad by the  parliamentary delegation should calm apprehensions and fulfill  everyone's expectations.    This note is signed: Firmin Jean-Louis, senator of the  Republic, president.</p>

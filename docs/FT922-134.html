			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / International Company News: Ericsson lifts venture stake ERICSSON, the Swedish telecommunications group, is increasing its stake in its mobile telephone joint venture with General Electric of the US from 60 to 80 per cent. Terms of the deal, which involves a restructuring of investments in Ericsson GE Mobile Communications, were not disclosed. The two companies agreed to join forces in August 1989 when Ericsson took a 60 per cent stake and GE the remaining 40 per cent. Ericsson said yesterday that it was 'a natural step' to increase its share as mobile telephones are closely associated with the company's core business. It pointed out that over the past two-and-a-half-years the market share for the company in mobile telephone systems in the North American market had risen from 25 to 30 per cent. Ericsson added that this had been helped by the 'great success' of the new generation digital dual-made mobile telephones.</p>

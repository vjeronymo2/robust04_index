			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / World Trade News: Paris to seek fresh EC-US farm deal MINISTERS from France's new centre-right government pledged yesterday to continue the previous administration's efforts to re-open last year's EC-US farm trade agreement, a keystone of the Uruguay Round world trade talks. Mr Alain Juppe, France's new foreign minister, told his EC colleagues that the new administration still had to be convinced about the compatibility of the November deal with the reform of EC common agricultural policy agreed last May. 'This is of capital importance for us,' he told fellow ministers in Luxembourg. 'It's of economic, political and social importance and I would even say it's important for reasons of culture and civilisation.' He also stressed that the government would continue its predecessor's opposition to the EC-US deal on oilseeds, which is separate from the Uruguay Round. But Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, the British foreign office minister, warned Mr Juppe the French would 'certainly not get anything better than the November deal'. The new government's chances of re-opening the agreement are slim. Senior agriculture officials from the 12 EC members have already concluded that Community undertakings within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) are compatible with the CAP reforms. But Mr Juppe said after yesterday's meeting that there was still work to be done: 'We have had a partial debate on certain consequences (of the EC-US deal) but we think we haven't obtained a response to the overall question (of compatibility)'. Foreign ministers, who were discussing whether to endorse the Washington deal, agreed to give the new French administration more time to form a view on the package. The Socialist government, heavily defeated in last week's elections, refused to sanction the EC-US agreement, principally on the grounds that it would jeopardise France's lucrative cereals trade. Although Mr Juppe said the new government would maintain the firm line of the outgoing socialists, other ministers and Sir Leon Brittan, the EC trade commissioner, welcomed the moderate tone in which the French views were expressed - a far cry from some of the more strident pronouncements by centre-right candidates on the hustings. Mr Gerard Longuet, the new French trade minister, said the Commission should be doing more to open a Gatt panel on US sanctions against EC steel exports. He was pleased with the tough line being taken by Sir Leon in the dispute over public procurement.</p>

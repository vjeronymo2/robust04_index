Marked achievements  were made in our province's economic construction, reform,  opening up, and various undertakings in society. In the course  of organizing economic work of the whole province, our  provincial government gained a clear understanding of the  situation very early, took prompt action, and grasped its work  expeditiously. Governments at all levels did much effective  work.    The session pointed out: The guiding thought, tasks,  targets, policies, and measures defined by our government work  report for our national economic and social development in 1994  conform with reality, and can be achieved through our hard work.    The session stressed: This year is a crucial one for the  establishment of the socialist market economy system. It is  also an important year in which we will concentrate our efforts  on speeding up infrastructure projects and pushing Jiangxi's  economy to a new height. We must correctly handle the  relationship among reform, development and stability; seize the  favorable opportunity; deepen reform; expand opening up; promote  development; and safeguard stability. We must accelerate the  pace of establishing our socialist market economy system, and  must strengthen and improve macroscopic regulation and control  so as to maintain the sustained, rapid and healthy development  of our national economy. We must promote the building of our  socialist spiritual civilization, and the all-round progress of  the society.    The session called on people of the whole province to arm  their minds with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics. Under the leadership of  the CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core,  they must unite as one, be of one heart and one mind, explore  their way forward, and make still greater contributions to  invigorating Jiangxi.    Participants in the session unanimously voted for six  resolutions by a show of hands. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Viktor Zubkov, chief of the Tax Inspectorate </F> of St. Petersburg, by Valentina Shestakova; place and date not  given: "Extremism Is Not the Best Remedy for a Sick Economy"]    [Text] Viktor Zubkov was appointed chief of the Tax  Inspectorate of St. Petersburg with the rank of deputy minister  seven months ago. He "inherited" a number of unresolved public  proceedings against the property fund and joint ventures and  arbitration proceedings involving numerous commercial structures  that had filed lawsuits over what they viewed as illegitimate  punitive sanctions by the tax inspectorate. The introduction of  new federal taxes and the vigorous creation of norms by the  local authorities were fraught with new conflicts involving the  tax organs. However, it blew over. In the first quarter of the  new year, the revenues of the budget increased by 4.5 percent as  compared to the fourth quarter of last year. In April, the  budget took in 382 million [as published], the assignment being  340 million [as published]. In total, 1.080 trillion rubles [R]  were taken in during the four months. Viktor Alekseyevich Zubkov  discusses the reserves that were tapped in order to invigorate  the intake of budgetary receipts:    [Zubkov] First, we made the rayon tax inspectorates  completely independent: Their chiefs no longer rush to the head  office over every trifle.    Second, we established an economic council at the  inspectorate. Issues of perfecting tax legislation are discussed  at the meetings of the council. They are later considered by the  mayor of the city, the government, or the State Tax Service. The  developed decisions concern the making of advance payments by  small enterprises, specify procedures for tax relief on profits,  control small-scale retail trade, and cancel unjustifiably harsh  measures against the violators of tax legislation.    For example, the edict of the president "On Offering a Tax  Amnesty in 1993" envisions that enterprises and entrepreneurs  who declared the underpayment of taxes before 30 November 1993  and paid the taxes before the same deadline shall not be subject  to relevant sanctions. If the tax organs discover concealed  receipts after the indicated deadlines, fines shall be collected  at three times the rate.    Those who have understated receipts frequently do not even  suspect that they have done so. The use of the tripled rates of  fines in the case of such taxpayers can hardly be considered  correct. We propose to index the underpayment as of the moment  of concealment or understatement of payments to the budget.    The computerization of our inspectorate is among the  measures  taken which we always mention with pleasure.    In early May, we signed a memorandum on the creation of a  computer network at the Tax Inspectorate of St. Petersburg with  the Government of Denmark. This is a large project, which is  worth more than $3.5 million and is financed by the Government  of Denmark. In addition to being outfitted with hardware and  communications, it is intended to allocate large funds for the  training of rayon inspectors and the improvement of computer  programming.    [Shestakova] So, you succeeded in doing something more than  just reinforcing the fiscal authorities. The outflow of  professional financiers from the inspectorate ceased; the audits  of banks and commercial structures no longer look like guerrilla  raids. The Finnish and Swedish governmental press, which  clamored to the whole world over the undiplomatic approach of  the Russian authorities to the economic operations of joint  ventures, has finally fallen silent....    [Zubkov] I see what you are talking about. All the problems  with joint ventures, the property fund, and other taxpayers  which developed last year could have been solved quietly,  without resorting to aggressive publicity. Indeed, a large  amount of fines, $24 million, was assessed against the Grand  Hotel Europe. There were also smaller amounts--the  Lenraumamebel, Pizza-Express.    The rayon financial services uncover financial violations.  Subsequently, the penalized enterprises approach the Russian Tax  Service and the government, and the latter examine the case with  our participation. The financial standing of these organizations  is analyzed, and a way is sought to punish the transgressors  without bankrupting them.    If the Lenraumamebel does close, how will it make things  better for anybody? The enterprise will wind down production,  and the 600 Russians it employs will be thrown out into the  street. I think that in such cases a compromise should be found.    This is not to say that such enterprises should be exempted  from fines or penalties. However, the fines should not finish  them off.    As far as the property fund is concerned, 92 million rubles  have been assessed against it rather than sums going into the  billions, as was advertised. They have already remitted R9.3  million to the budget. And R69 million have been remitted from  the accounts of the fund without recourse. We will definitely  collect the balance. A special commission will monitor this.    [Shestakova] The budget is demanding still new infusions,  including yet another round of harsher taxation. Thus, by his  Edict No. 2270, the president granted the local authorities the  right to independently set the rates of taxes and introduce new  taxes. St. Petersburg was quick to take advantage of this right  and, next to Moscow, is a leader in tightening the taxes....    [Zubkov] We got three new taxes confirmed by a directive of  the mayor: for the maintenance of the housing stock, facilities  of the sociocultural sector, and law enforcement organs. The  land fee increased 10-fold. Another three taxes are pending. As  a large European city, St. Petersburg should introduce taxes on  car parking, the passage of vessels along the Neva, and for  entering the city. This should be done as soon as possible. A  great many foreign-made cars are parked in the downtown area of  the city for weeks, and private parking lots are getting  organized. Their owners hardly pay anything to the budget.    However, the city has been given the right not just to  introduce taxes, but also to grant exemptions from them.    If a certain company has been worn down by fees but its  operation is a vital necessity for the city, we are entitled to  seek an exemption from some local taxes for the enterprise  through the economic council. The federal taxes are not our  prerogative.    The reserve sources of budgetary receipts have not been  depleted yet. A special directorate that only handles large  payers was created at the inspectorate. Most of them have not  been audited once in the last three years. Large enterprises  will now be monitored on an annual basis.    Relief and reductions granted to the Lenenergo, the  Vodokanal, and other enterprises of municipal services run up to  about R30 billion; however, these infusions have not produced  results for the city. It is much more feasible to make them  count money and value every job. This year, we have already  directed the tax personnel to step up work with individuals,  including foreign citizens. All of this means extra money.  Budgetary proceeds also increase in a stable manner due to the  invigoration of the work of the state inspectorate, jointly with  the Tax Police Department, on commercial structures, the trade  sector, and large payers.</p>

			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: British role in Bolivia's lost sea link Sir, I loved Christina Lamb's description of the Bolivian navy ('Despatches: The navy lark', September 11/12), but what a shame she doesn't know the story behind the disappearance of the country from Victorian maps and the British collusion with Chile to rob Bolivia of its access to the sea. The problem began with an unfortunate decision by Bolivia's humorous but mentally ill president of the 1860s, Mariano Melgarejo. He decided to punish the British ambassador for having the temerity to say that he didn't much care for the qualities of chicha (part-fermented wine: a South American favourite of the period). His punishment was to drink an entire barrel of chocolate and then be led, facing backwards, astride a donkey through the main street of La Paz. He was sent back to London. In response, Queen Victoria reputedly asked for a map of South America, drew a cross in chalk through Bolivia, and declared furiously: 'Bolivia doesn't exist.' Britain was, in fact, the real victor of the War of the Pacific, for while Chile gained the territory, a convenient coup prevented President Balmaceda from nationalising the nitrate mining concerns, which remained under the control of the Liverpool Nitrate Company.

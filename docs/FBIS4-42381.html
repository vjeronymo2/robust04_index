			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by David Sharrock and Lawrence Donegan: "IRA </F> Intelligence War Suffers Setback"]    [Text] The greatest blow to the intelligence war against  the IRA dealt by last night's helicoptcr crash will be felt by  the Royal Ulster Constabulary [RUC], which takes the leading  role in antiterrorism.    The head of its Special Branch was feared to be among the  dead last night. His role, at the very top of the intelligence  pyramid, is seen as crucial in the fight against the IRA.    Special Branch's most important task is in the gathering and  collating of information about IRA volunteers.    Among the dead were also figures from the Northern Ireland  Office's shadowy terrorist finance unit, a department so  secretive that many of its operatives are not even familiar to  long-standing civil servants.    Members of the department which is senior in rank to the  RUC's C13 antiracketeering unit, are drawn from other government  departments because of their expertise in taxation accountancy  banking, VAT [value-added tax] and financial law.    The department played a key role in last month's Operation  Madronna, the biggest antiterrorist finance operation ever  carried out, supported by police forces in England, Northern  Ireland and the Irish Republic.    Special Branch's responsibiIities include recruiting of  agents within the paramilitary organisations and the running of  these prized figures. Highly placed security figures on both  side of the border agree that a well-placed mole is the most  dangerous threat to the paramilitaries.    Special Branch is also in command of organising other means  of acquiring information, such as eavesdropping and photographic  record, all of which is handled within the RUC's "E" department.    The department would also co-ordinate liaison with other  intelligence services, including M15, Interpol, Scotland yard's  antiterrorist squad, and the FBI and CIA in the United States.    Much of the Special Branch's energy in Northern Ireland is  expended infiltrating and recruiting from loyalist and  republican paramilitary groups. It has undoubtedly made inroads  into both factions, although its methods have frequently been  criticised.    Last September the family of IRA man Joseph Mulhern, who was  shot dead by his paramilitary colleagues, accused branch  officers of pressurising his son into working for the security  service.    Frank Mulhern, the IRA man's father, claimed his son was  taken to the RUC interrogation centre at Casllreagh and told  that if he did not provide information, police would use  contacts with loyalists to have members of his family shot.    Raymond Gilmour, a former RUC supergrass whose evidence was  used in attempts to jail over 30 terrorist suspects claimed a  Special Branch officer tried to recruit him when he was  teenager. After he was arrested for his part in a robbery in  the late 1970's, Gilmour was approached by the same officer. He  eventually agreed to infiltrate the Irish National Liberation  Army.    "Others may have seen me as an informer, but my handler  called me an agent and I saw myself as an undercover policeman.  My handler told me: The only thing I can't give you is a  uniform," he later said.    In recent years, Special Branch officers in the province  have  been involved in a power struggle with their MI5 counterparts  over who controls the antiterrorist operations in Northern  Ireland.    The decision taken over a year ago, by the then Home  Secretary Kenneth Clarke, to give primacy over such activities  to the MI5 provoked a great deal of resentment within the branch.    Last night one security source said that the crash was the  most serious blow since the murder of two highranking RUC  officers, who were shot dead in the Ardoyne district of North  Belfast in 1971. Their murders are said to have contributed  significantly to the failure of the internment raids which were  supposed to have removed the senior players in Northern  Ireland's paramilitary organisations.</p>

			<p><P> February 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HELPING THE CIVILIANS TO GUARD THE GUARDS;  </P> <P> LATIN AMERICA: PANAMA PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE OUR EMPHASIS IN THE  REGION, BOLSTERING DEMOCRATIC RULE INSTEAD OF TRAINING ARMIES.  </P> <P> The crisis in Panama has served to remind us yet again of the cursed influence  of the military on civilian politics in Latin America. The political future of  Latin American nations lies in a systematic redressing of the balance between  military power and civilian authority -- a process in which the United States  can and must play a pivotal role.  </P> <P> President Bush has made welcome proposals to provide Panama with nearly $1  billion to support democracy by restoring the tattered economy. As we allocate  these enormous resources, however, we must pay attention to the critical  element of building civilian political control over the security forces.  </P> <P> In far too many Latin countries -- in Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Brazil  and Uruguay -- elected democrats remain hemmed in by the power of unelected  military overseers who usurp civilian functions. The recent killings of six  priests in El Salvador make it clear that the crisis there involves not only  the ideological struggle between the forces of right and left but also the  struggle of the civilian leadership to assert authority over a dangerously  independent army.  </P> <P> Latin American armies have consistently played pernicious political roles. The  United States has often played a contributing role in creating, training and  arming soldiers. Our policy-makers have argued that through American efforts  these armies might become more professional, more democratic, more influenced  by us. None of this has come about. The governing style of military regimes  includes human-rights crimes, all-encompassing and easily abused definitions of  national security, and dislike of democracy. In Panama, the U.S.-trained  Defense Forces turned out to be unprofessional enough to be easily corrupted by  a corrupt leader.  </P> <P> Once and for all, we must dedicate our considerable resources to helping Latin  America's democrats wipe out the deadly myth spun by their militaries: that it  is the soldiers who, in the words of the Argentine military, safeguard their  nation's "essence."  </P> <P> In the 1980s, the United States supported dictators, invoking geopolitical need  and the fear of communist-inspired political instability. Today, given the  changes in Soviet foreign policy, our policies can no longer be based solely on  the traditional concern for hemispheric military security. Only if we commit  ourselves to empowering Latin civilians in the oversight of military affairs  can we sustain the hope for enduring, pluralist rule.  </P> <P> Many practical ways exist to reapportion political and military functions. As  the Panamanians begin their unique experiment in turning soldiers into "good  cops," we can provide technical support for splitting off the non-police  functions of the former defense forces, such as immigration and customs, over  which the military had assumed authority. Police academies can teach respect  for human rights, democratic political ethics and legal process, while showing  that police officers have honor in democratic societies. Political parties can  increase their awareness of law-and-order issues, even as the civilian  government assumes financial control over the soldiers.  </P> <P> In Panama, politicians, from the grass roots to the legislative level, must  also be helped to devise an effective democracy in a political arena scarred by  decades of military rule. Their parties may value training in the nuts and  bolts of liberal institution-building and governance. In such efforts lies  their security. By now we know that weak civilian institutions, squabbling  politicians and polarized politics only invite soldiers to take power, with two  tanks or 2,000.  </P> <P> If the Panamanians are successful in demilitarizing their forces, they will  provide an invaluable model for the region. Such a restructuring of  civil-military relations in Latin America will obviously not be easy. Still, if  we truly believe, along with so many millions of Latin Americans, that  democracy can make a stand, then we must rapidly complement our financial  investments with sturdy programs of practical assistance in the sphere of  civil-military relations. Upholding democratic values in civilians is surely  more plausible and profitable than trying to instill them in soldiers. We must  help Latin civilians guard the guards.  </P></p>

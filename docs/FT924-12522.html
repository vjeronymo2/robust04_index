			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Survey of Locating in North America (5): Enhanced packages - Incentives THE adage that information is power has a new application in the corporate relocation business. As companies have learned more about what array of incentives are available (or even conceivable) and other companies' agreements have become standards to exceed, incentive packages to lure relocating firms have increased. 'The level of incentives has increased in the last two years,' says Mr Robert Ady, president of PHH Fantus, the leading US consulting company. Incentive packages used to run between Dollars 10,000 and Dollars 30,000 per worker, or some 10-30 per cent of total investment. But now, says Mr Ady, while the range is the same, the average has risen a couple of percentage points, or to about Dollars 20,000 per worker instead of Dollars 15,000. Several factors have contributed to the rise in incentives. The track record of relocations has improved and become more public in the past few years and this has permitted wider and greater knowledge in the corporate community of what kind of deals can be done. This in turn has prompted firms to attempt to secure an even better deal than that of a previous company. This desire could be especially keen if the previous deal was with a competitor. As evidence perhaps of how companies want to drive harder bargains, consulting companies see corporate relocation as a growing business area. For example, Ernst &amp; Young, the big accounting and consulting firm, joined the International Association of Corporate Real Estate Executives to conduct a relocation study, called 'Reshaping America', published earlier this year. Next year it will publish its new guide, 'Ernst &amp; Young's Guide to US Business Cities'. US states, cities and towns are more eager than ever to secure new jobs. The vast wave of corporate shrinkage that has swept the US since the start of the decade has meant that unemployment has remained high. Many states have had to face fiscal crunches and are keen to attract new corporate citizens that will generate state revenues. Tax relief 'is part of the equation even if money is tight', says Mr Ady. Tax incentives for investors - particularly if they create new jobs - are on the books in most US states. But like the companies looking for the best deal for relocation, states and cities have also become more shrewd about what they may be giving away. Many are now inserting what are known as 'clawback clauses' into their relocation incentive deals. These force the company to return the subsidies that the state or city provided if it does not live up to its agreement. The town of Ypsilanti, Michigan is, for example, suing General Motors over the company's decision to close its plant there. The town says that GM violated the agreement it made to provide employment in return for tax abatements. Detroit and New York City have similar cases against other companies. Nonetheless, traditional tax incentives, as well as infrastructure improvements and financing, usually through bonds, remain important items for negotiating a deal. Even utility companies are becoming more creative about luring corporate relocations using services, rate incentives, financing and community economic development programmes. But states and cities as well as companies are turning to a broader than ever variety of other incentives. These can include incentives regarding acquisition of machinery, building of day care centres, assistance with finding housing for relocating employees and subsidised home mortgages. In particular, training of the workforce is increasingly becoming the key incentive for many companies. In 1970, the typical PHH Fantus client did 90 per cent of its workforce training in-house and just 10 per cent externally. Today, the company says its studies indicate that by 2000 those numbers will reverse. Some states, such as Georgia and South Carolina, have programmes that will train a workforce to the required specifications of incoming investors. Other states are expected to follow suit with similar types of programmes in order to compete. States can also feel that - instead of giving away their rights to tax revenues, infrastructure - training and other quality of life type incentives are attractions that will remain if a given company decides to move on. One result of the greater array of incentives and the competition for corporate relocations is that searches are taking longer, according to Mr Ady. BMW's selection of Spartanburg, South Carolina for its new US plant took three years. The length of the search has increased because corporate relocations teams have become bigger, which has meant more complicated scheduling for trips to the site. And often the teams return to the site three or four times before a decision is made. For foreign firms, this could also be an expensive proposition. But there is no substitute for personal contact with the location and its people. Given widespread American antipathy toward Japan, it is important for Japanese companies, in particular, to get a feel for the community's receptivity toward their investment. The presence of other foreign firms, especially those from one's own country, can also provide some comfort. In BMW's case, a number of other German firms, including Siemens, Bosch and Bayer are also in South Carolina.</p>

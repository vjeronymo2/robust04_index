			<p><P> December 26, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ZOIA CEAUSESCU WANTS POODLES IN JAIL WITH HER  </P> <P> Bucharest television today showed Zoia Ceausescu, the daughter of executed  Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu who was arrested Sunday.  </P> <P> She appeared haggard, leaning against a wall in the garden of a family home,  cigarette in hand, by the luxurious apartment in which she had lived.  </P> <P> Before she was driven away in an armored car, she asked: "Do you have room in  the police truck for my poodles?"  </P> <P> The television also showed jewelry confiscated from the young woman, who  evidently shared a taste for luxuries with her slain mother, Elena.  </P> <P> Among the items displayed were seven expensive watches, jewelry, $95,000 in  cash, valuable paintings taken from Romanian art museums and pearls "which we  don't think are false."  </P> <P> "Such a modest baggage for such a long trip (to jail)," the commentator said  sarcastically.  </P> <P> The TV also showed meat supposedly shipped in from Vienna for her dogs.  </P> <P> A high-level Romanian defector said in a book published last year that he  reported to Elena Ceausescu once a week with tapes secretly recorded at the  residences of her children -- Zoia, Nicu and Valentin -- so she could keep tabs  on them.  </P></p>

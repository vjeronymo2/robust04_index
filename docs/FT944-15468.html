			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / International Company News: Berjaya to take direct control of Singer subsidiary Berjaya, the Malaysian conglomerate controlled by Malaysian-Chinese businessman Mr Vincent Tan, has announced a wide-ranging shake-up of its corporate structure, writes Kieran Cooke in Kuala Lumpur. The complex exercise will bring the listed Berjaya Singer, a producer of household goods and one of the most profitable companies in the Berjaya stable, under the direct control of Berjaya Group, the quoted company which serves as the conglomerate's holding company and flagship. Under the present structure, Berjaya Singer is controlled through two other listed companies in the group, Berjaya Industrial and Berjaya Leisure. Berjaya Group says the new arrangement will mean that Berjaya Singer's profits to the group holding company will no longer be diluted. Berjaya, with interests including textiles, media, leisure and casino operations and timber concerns, has been restructured several times in recent years. The latest reorganisation involves cash and share transactions between the various Berjaya companies, plus a Berjaya Group rights issue which aims to raise nearly MDollars 970m (USDollars 379m). The cash would be used to repay loans and finance Berjaya's ambitious expansion plans. Earlier this month, Berjaya companies announced plans to gain control of Indah Water, a consortium which has been given charge of a MDollars 6.4bn scheme to upgrade Malaysia's sewerage system.</p>

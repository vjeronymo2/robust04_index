			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Peregrine confirms 24% stake in Invesco Peregrine, the Hong Kong securities house backed by some of the colony's most powerful businessmen, yesterday confirmed that on Monday it lifted its stake in Invesco MIM, the fund manager, from 14.9 per cent to just over 24 per cent. Peregrine said that the stake would be held as an investment and that it had no intention of buying more shares 'at this stage'. Invesco MIM said that both sides had been in regular contact. 'We have every reason to believe their intentions are friendly.' Peregrine bought its latest tranche of shares at 77p. The shares were apparently bought from Legal &amp; General Investments and Daido Mutual Life. Invesco's shares, which added 9p to 84p on Monday, gained a further 4p to 88p yesterday.</p>

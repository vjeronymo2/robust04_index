			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A DELICATE BALANCE OF FLAVORS IN AFGHAN FOOD;  </P> <P> CUISINE: FLAVORFUL, HEARTY AND ROBUST, FOODS OF AFGHAN DRAW UPON CULTURES OF  ASIA, INDIA AND THE MIDEAST.  </P> <P> Strategically situated on the ancient Silk Road connecting Europe with the Far  East, Afghanistan was for centuries the meeting point of many cultures,  especially Central Asian, Middle Eastern and Indian. Its food is a fusion of  ancient cuisines.  </P> <P> There are pastas and steamy dumplings from the Persians and the nomadic Turks;  glorious breads and yogurt sauces from Central Asia; Middle Eastern roasts,  pilafs and delicate filo pastries; and sweet spices from India. Dishes such as  ravioli with creamy leek filling, smoky grilled kebabs with fiery  walnut-coriander dip, pumpkin topped with yogurt and meat sauce, noodle soup  with meat balls and braised spinach and rhubarb with dill may have a trendy  sound, but they are everyday fare in Afghanistan.  </P> <P> Kebabs, an especially popular item in restaurants, are the centerpiece of  Afghan cuisine. "We make kebabs with lean cubes of meat and exquisitely season  them with yogurt and spices before threading them on skewers and charbroiling,"  says K. Wali Shokoor, owner of Khyber Pass in Berkeley. As a result, the kebabs  are mild, succulent and highly aromatic. A perky herb dip, a green salad and  the earthy, oversized pita-like bread called nan generally accompany these  kebabs.  </P> <P> The real jewel of Afghan food, however, is its vegetables. "We have a way with  vegetables to make simple ones taste extraordinary," says Mohammed Ashraf  Karimi, owner of Bamiyan in Washington, D.C, the oldest Afghan restaurant in  the United States (it opened in 1975). Afghan cuisine often combines vegetables  with palate-stimulating toppings such as a small portion of flavored meat (a  familiar East Asian technique) or highly seasoned dressings such as yogurt  sauce (a Middle-Eastern way of enriching a dish) made with plain yogurt, minced  garlic and salt.  </P> <P> Vegetables such as pumpkin, eggplant, cauliflower, okra and leeks thus are  turned into scrumptious preparations. Kadu, for example, combines sweet pumpkin  with spicy ground meat and a garlicky sauce. Similarly, Banjan borani -- an  Afghan ratatouille of eggplant, tomatoes, hot chiles and coriander -- is  mellowed with a tart yogurt sauce.  </P> <P> "Basically, Afghan food is very delicate," says Helen Saberi, a British woman  who married into a traditional Afghan family and has written the most  comprehensive book on its food and customs, "Noshe Djan: Afghan Food and  Cookery" (Prospect Books, 1986). Chinese chives, she explains, are preferred  over onions, and herbs -- mint, dill, coriander and parsley -- and citrus  flavorings such as lemon and even bitter orange essence are used in place of  spices.  </P> <P> This is evident in the delicate veal-sausage kebabs lola kebab, flavored with  just a touch of ground coriander; the fragrant chive turnovers bolani gandana  do not contain any spices at all. "We consider Afghan food non-spicy but  scented," says Saberi.  </P> <P> Afghan cuisine also relies upon contrasting sensations to stimulate the palate:  cool against hot, mild against spicy. "Our customers are constantly amazed at  the way Afghan food combines various components of flavor," says Nassir Ahmad  Bayat, chef/owner of Pamir Restaurant in New York City, explaining how  piping-hot dumplings, pasta and vegetables, for example, are served with cool  yogurt sauce and mellow kebabs and turnovers are paired with fiery condiments  such as walnut-coriander dip.  </P> <P> Afghan cuisine is extraordinarily flavorful, hearty and robust. At best it can  be described as comfort food, soothing and reassuring as an "easy-go-down," in  the words of M.F.K. Fisher. Riesling, Chardonnay, a malty beer or iced tea make  excellent accompaniments.  </P> <P> BOLANI GANDANA  </P> <P> (Chinese Chive Turnovers)  </P> <P> From Pamir, New York City  </P> <P> 3 cups chopped Chinese chives or leeks  </P> <P> Salt  </P> <P> 1 1/2 teaspoons black pepper  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic  </P> <P> 1 cup plus 2 tablespoon corn oil  </P> <P> 8 egg roll skins, chilled  </P> <P> Plain yogurt, chilled  </P> <P> Combine chives with salt to taste, pepper, garlic and 2 tablespoons oil. Blend  well.  </P> <P> Place egg roll skins, 1 at time, on work surface. Rub edges with water. Divide  chive mixture into 8 portions and spoon 1 portion onto each skin. Fold skins to  enclose filling and form triangles. Press to seal edges.  </P> <P> Heat remaining 1 cup oil in skillet to 375 degrees.

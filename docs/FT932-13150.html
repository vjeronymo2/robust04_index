			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Barclays sought An argument that the bank most badly hit by the recession should be the one to gain most effectively from economic recovery prompted one securities house to repeat its enthusiasm on Barclays in spite of a recent strong run. Kleinwort Benson reiterated its buy stance on the stock and added a 1995 profit forecast of Pounds 1.8bn to its existing 1993 estimate of Pounds 600m and its 1994 figure of Pounds 1.1bn. There was also some catching up with stablemate NatWest, which outperformed Barclays earlier in the week following a recommendation from Morgan Stanley. Barclays shares rose 7 to 440p on turnover of 7.8m while profit-takers took NatWest down 4 1/2 to 468p.</p>

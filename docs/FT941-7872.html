			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Major set to ask Clinton for block on Adams visits Mr John Major will next week urge President Bill Clinton to reject any new request from Mr Gerry Adams to visit the US unless the Sinn Fein president renounces the use of violence by the IRA. Amid signs that Mr Clinton would be reluctant to allow Mr Adams a repeat of his public relations triumph in New York earlier this month, British officials said Mr Major would stress the potential damage to the UK-Irish peace initiative. After his talks last weekend with Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, Mr Major would stress that there were no differences between the approach of London and Dublin in efforts to secure a settlement in Northern Ireland. The officials said Mr Major would emphasise that this approach - and the resultant pressure on the IRA and Sinn Fein to renounce violence - would be undermined if Mr Adams were again given permission to visit the US. The prime minister would give the same message in talks with Mr Tom Foley, speaker of the House of Representatives, and other senior figures. It is understood that the Washington administration has offered private assurances to Downing Street that the differences over Mr Adams' visit do not represent a fundamental shift in US policy. That view has been echoed by US officials who acknowledged that the failure of Mr Adams to embrace December's Anglo-Irish declaration during his New York trip caused considerable disappointment in the White House. Officials are less confident, however, that Mr Major and Mr Clinton will find it as easy to smooth transatlantic frictions over the west's approach to the Bosnian war. In spite of the success of the Nato initiative to lift the siege of Sarajevo, officials on both sides of the Atlantic believe there is still a considerable risk of further disputes over the war in the former Yugoslav province. Britain's demand that the US commit ground troops to the UN operation in Bosnia has been met with a flat rejection and some irritation in Washington. For its part the London government remains unconvinced that the Clinton administration is ready to put pressure on the Bosnian government to reach a settlement with the Serbs. US officials said the Bosnian issue had become a test of Nato's new role after the end of the cold war, raising fears that further disputes could undermine Washington's long-term commitment to European security. Mr Major hopes that the form of his visit next week - he will stay overnight at the White House after lengthy talks with President Clinton in Pittsburgh  -will at least put to rest recent talk of a permanent Anglo-US rift.</p>

			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Phantoms that haunt the banking network: Banks admit to stream of complaints over auto-teller withdrawals AUTO-TELLER machine systems in use today strike a compromise between cost and effectiveness. Contrary to what the banks would like customers to believe, the systems are vulnerable to hardware and software glitches. However, most experts believe risks of 'phantom withdrawals' are small compared with human error or attempts to defraud. Banks are now being forced to accept that their auto-teller networks are fallible. Barclays this year admitted that a fault persisted for several days in the interbank Visa network. It resulted in all rejected auto-teller transactions for non-Barclays Visa cards being debited in spite of the rejection. Miss Elizabeth Bellot, an accountant from the Channel Islands who banks with TSB, tried to withdraw cash from a Barclays cash machine during a visit to Crewe in February last year. She was refused, but returned home to discover that she had been debited Pounds 600 for the attempted withdrawals. The machine at Crewe was not malfunctioning, Barclays said, adding: 'We remain satisfied that the integrity of our ATM network remains secure.' The bank has, however, been unable to explain further the nature of the fault. No two auto-teller systems are alike, but the principles are universal. The technology that exists - data written on a magnetic stripe on a card used in conjunction with a personal identification number (PIN) - is cheap but vulnerable. Its main shortcoming is its inability to tell a genuine card-holder from a fraud. If a card and the corresponding PIN are presented, and the cash withdrawal is within agreed limits, it will be authorised. The system has no knowledge of the individual initiating the transaction. Responsibility for keeping the card secure and the PIN secret lies with the cardholder. A stolen card is comparatively easy to copy. On the front it bears the customer's primary account number, usually a combination of the customer's account number and branch clearing code, together with some administration characters. On the back is a magnetic stripe, divided into three tracks. Track one was defined historically for airline use only; track three is no longer used by UK banks - at one time it recorded amounts withdrawn when some banks operated auto-tellers both on-line and off-line. On-line working is now used throughout the UK - every transaction is referred immediately for validation of the card, PIN and amount. Track two contains up to 40 bytes of information, which can include the primary account number, expiry date and cryptographic keys. The technology used to write and read the magnetic stripe is simple. Sweden, however, is experimenting with deeper levels of magnetisation to 'watermark' cards. Fraudsters could therefore duplicate a stolen card. If they had access to the corresponding PIN, the card could be used to make withdrawals until the theft was discovered. Creating an entirely false card is a different proposition. During a transaction, the PIN is combined with information from the primary account number in a complicated piece of mathematics that may involve a hardware security module - a sealed, tamper-resistant box of encryption electronics - to create a message that includes the amount of the transaction and certain security codes. That message is despatched to the issuer's computer centre where it is checked - again possibly using a hardware security module. The PIN is not decoded; experts say it should never appear 'in the clear' during validation and authentication, and there is no reason anybody in the bank should be able to learn it. The fact remains that an auto-teller network is made by humans, and is therefore susceptible to human ingenuity. An experienced computer engineer could undoubtedly learn a customer's PIN, given enough time. But that would be of little use without the primary account number and other cryptographic codes. Phantom withdrawals are a very British concern. There are roughly equal numbers of auto-tellers in the US, Europe and Japan (about 100,000 each) yet disputed withdrawals seem comparatively rare in the US, where there is more concern about being mugged after making a withdrawal. To improve the system, the banks are considering including 'message authentication codes' which would virtually guarantee the integrity of messages sent between auto-tellers and host computers. So-called smart cards, with complete computer systems built in, are intrinsically more secure than magnetic-stripe cards, but significantly more expensive. They are virtually impossible to forge and all the encryption technology can be built into the card itself. But smart cards can be stolen. The real answer is positive identification of the customer when the transaction is initiated. Banks are beginning to consider installing cameras within auto-tellers to photograph customers. Signature verification is a more attractive possibility, but that technology is relatively immature. It also has to be made capable of working in the harsh conditions of the real world - auto-tellers suffer from wear and tear and shoppers struggling with their bags may not like the trouble of signing their names. Other possibilities include a range of biometric measurements - eye retinal patterns, sweat analysis, fingerprint recognition. That could attract objections both from civil-rights groups and customers. Smart cards, Page 10</p>

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / International Company News: Peugeot and Finaxa in FFr6bn cash call Two French companies will today announce plans to raise capital through the bond market. Peugeot, the motor group, launches a FFr3.96bn (Dollars 671m) convertible issue and Finaxa, a subsidiary of the Axa insurance concern, is staging a FFr1.9bn convertible issue. Peugeot, which last summer raised FFr1.5bn from a bond issue by its car subsidiary, said it had decided to go ahead with the exercise to take advantage of favourable market conditions following recent reductions in interest rates. Peugeot said it planned to use the issue to restructure its borrowings. The timing of the transaction, which will involve the issue of 4m bonds at FFr990 each, coincided with indications from the French government that it might slow down its privatisation programme possibly by postponing the proposed sale of Renault, the other large French motor group. Peugeot, like Renault, has had a difficult time over the past year due to the intensely competitive condition of the European motor market. It fell into the red with a net interim loss of FFr1.12bn in the first half of 1993, against a deficit of FFr2.3bn in the same period of 1992. Its 1993 results are due to be published in late April. In the meantime Mr Jacques Calvet, chairman, has consistently declined to comment on its performance for the full financial year. Meanwhile Finaxa, which is controlled by Axa, but also has the Paribas financial group as a sizeable minority shareholder, is today issuing 1.44m convertible bonds at FFr1,370 each. Neither Axa nor Paribas will subscribe to the Finaxa issue thereby reducing their holdings. Axa will retain control but with a stake reduced to 54.2 per cent from 61.4 per cent. Paribas's holding will be reduced to 23.6 per cent from 26.7 per cent.</p>

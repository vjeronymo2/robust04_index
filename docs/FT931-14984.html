			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Court is told of BP corruption at very high level HIGH-LEVEL corruption within British Petroleum led to the oil company becoming the victim of extensive fraud over its North Sea investment programme, a London court heard yesterday. Confidential details of tenders submitted for pipes and pumping equipment contracts worth up to Pounds 50m were leaked by BP employees to middlemen who passed the information on to European and Japanese companies competing for the business, Southwark Crown Court was told. The information allowed companies to undercut rivals or increase the final price charged to BP. Companies such as Thyssen, Sulzer Pumps UK and Borsig as well as Japanese engineering groups were among the beneficiaries of the fraud, Mr Stephen Batten QC, prosecuting for the Serious Fraud Office, said. On trial are two of the alleged 'middlemen', Mr Josef Szrajber of Mayfair, London, and Mr Paolo Sorelli of Paddington, London. Both deny seven charges of conspiracy to defraud BP by using confidential information relating to contract tenders between 1988 and 1990. The alleged corruption involved three elements, Mr Batten said. They were BP staff prepared to leak information, the middlemen or 'pedlars' who passed it on and the companies willing to pay for it. The corruption within BP's procurement department went to a very high level, he said. 'Not perhaps to the very top, but certainly the sort of level which must have had good inside information,' he added. One BP employee - referred to as Mr X - was a particularly important source of information. Documents showed the 'commissions' - usually 2 per cent or 3 per cent of the contract value - were often split three ways between Mr X, Mr Szrajber and Mr Sorelli. A Thyssen employee, Mr Manfred Reuss, also took a cut in commissions when his company won a contract, Mr Batten said. Mr Sorelli had access to BP personnel and Mr Szrajber dealt with the companies prepared to pay for information. Records kept by Mr Szrajber, which were seized after his offices were searched in the summer of 1990, gave considerable detail of the corrupt deals and were likely to prove his undoing, Mr Batten said. A document Mr Sorelli sent Mr Szrajber explained how Mr X would receive half of a 4 per cent commission needed to pay other people in BP's procurement division. The trial continues today.</p>

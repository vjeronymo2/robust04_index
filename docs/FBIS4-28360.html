			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "SDPJ's Outrageous Political Maneuvering"] </F>   [Text] It is over a month since the Hata cabinet was  formed and the administration continues to drift on uncertain  waters, betraying weaknesses as a minority government such as  the resignation of a justice minister for his ignominious  remark, and contradictory statements by various ministers at  Diet sessions.    Even more dismal is the spectacle of the Social Democratic  Party of Japan [SDPJ] since it seceded from the coalition to  join the ranks of the opposition.    Immediately after the present cabinet was inaugurated, SDPJ  Chairman Tomiichi Murayama attempted to take political  leadership by advocating "negotiated dissolution" of the House  of Representatives. He proposed: "The next general election  should be held under the current multiseat district system on  condition that the following general elections are held under  the new system of single-seat districts and proportional  representation."    However, "Murayama's initiative" that advocated an early  dissolution of the Diet under the current multiseat constituency  system met with fierce opposition from the "Democrats," a policy  group of SDPJ rightists who advocate political reform.    The reasons for opposition are twofold: (1) political reform  bills which were passed by the Diet will be complete only when  bills on redrawing electoral districts for the Lower House,  which are being drawn up at present, are passed by the Diet; (2)  if a general election is held under the current multiseat  constituency system before political reform bills are passed by  the Diet, the single- seat constituency system, whose  introduction was decided by the will of the Diet, will become  merely nominal. This would be tantamount to "torpedoing  political reform" in the final analysis.    As a replacement for "Murayama's initiative" which lost its  persuasiveness, SDPJ Secretary General Wataru Kubo advocated  "voluntary general resignation." Kubo said: "The Hata cabinet  should resign en masse after the budget for the current fiscal  year is passed, and should begin talks with the SDPJ toward  forming a third coalition government within a new framework."    Although "a new framework" is set as a condition, in the  final analysis this is a clear indication of the SDPJ's  intention to "return to the coalition government."    To cope with the political situation after the passage of  the  budget, the SDPJ chairman and the general secretary presented  two strategies which are diametrically opposed to each other.  In addition, "Kubo's initiative" encountered criticism from  inside and outside the party.    At the central committee meeting of the SDPJ which began on  28 May, an immediate action plan was proposed in which two  contradictory strategies -- "Murayama's initiative" and "Kubo's  initiative" were written side by side. Kubo's initiative was  criticized for "pandering to power in an unprincipled manner."    Depending upon the interpretation of the strategies, they  may  be taken as a two-pronged plan amid an unclear political  situation, but both contain fatal contradictions.    In establishing the post-Hata administration in the ruling  coalition parties, the SDPJ confirmed a "new policy agreement"  after lengthy policy discussion. However, when it found out  about the group called "Kaishin" that excluded the SDPJ, it  broke away from the coalition government, claiming it was a  "breach of faith."    Although the blame may be laid on the side that formed  "Kaishin" without notifying the SDPJ, the SDPJ made the Hata  administration a minority government by resorting to the most  forceful action -- breaking away from the coalition government.  The SDPJ will never obtain a satisfactory understanding from  the public if it tries to "return to power" in such a short time  no matter how it emphasizes "a new framework and discussion for  political power."    Moreover, apart from an emergency such as the prime minister  falling seriously ill, if the current cabinet resigns en masse  merely because of talks with the SDPJ, and without the passage  of a non-confidence vote or a situation where the passage of a  non- confidence vote is inevitable, and undertakes to establish  a coalition government, that will be not so much illicit union  as "collusive politics" which seek one's own interests without  regard for the public.    What the SDPJ needs at present is not to be swayed by the  prospect of immediate advantage but to conduct an all-out debate  within the party on how to develop its own perspective of the  future political situation.</p>

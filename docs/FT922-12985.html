			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / International Company News: Hafnia shareholders fight Skandia INSTITUTIONAL shareholders in Hafnia Holding, the Danish insurance group, claim to have raised sufficient shareholder support to call an extraordinary shareholders' meeting and to block the proposed takeover of Hafnia by Sweden's Skandia. Opposition to Skandia has been led by the LD Fund, controlled by the Danish trade unions. Mr Jeppe Christiansen, the fund's investment manager, said yesterday there was support from large and small shareholders for the extraordinary meeting. He said such a meeting would be called when shareholders have an alternative solution to the takeover by Skandia. Skandia agreed to take over Hafnia last Thursday after negotiations with its board. Hafnia has been financially weakened by an attempt, with Norway's UNI Storebrand, to gain control of Skandia. The aim was to set up a Nordic insurance alliance. Skandia has made its bid conditional on acceptance by 90 per cent of the capital and votes in Hafnia. Analysts maintain the bid is far too low. Mr Lau Svendsen, from the Copenhagen broking firm Fibroco, said the bid, worth about DKr2.7bn (Dollars 429m) at market value, is worth less than the book value of Hafnia Holding's equity, which is about DKr3.1bn. The bid takes no account of Hafnia's goodwill value or the goodwill write-offs, worth about DKr1.2bn. A shareholders' revolt can only succeed, said Mr Svendsen, if they can find an alternative solution to Hafnia Holding's problems. This means they must find a way of selling Hafnia's 14.8 per cent stake in Skandia and its 33.7 per cent stake in its domestic rival Baltica. The stake in Baltica has created speculation that the outcome of the Hafnia shareholders' action could be a merger between Hafnia and Baltica, a solution which was discussed two years ago but fell through.</p>

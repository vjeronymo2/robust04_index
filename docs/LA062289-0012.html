			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KNIGHT REAGAN  </P> <P> Once again our former President has demonstrated his abysmal ignorance of an  indifference to American history and people (not to mention his own Irish  heritage) by his unseemly acceptance of a knighthood from British royalty. As  if tributes to fallen Nazi SS soldiers were not enough, now we witness sworn  fealty to the very sovereigns against whom our forefathers and foremothers  sacrificed their lives to win our independence.  </P> <P> Am I the only person who feels that Ronald Reagan's latest foray into  self-aggrandizement is a slap in the face to all the American patriots who  fought and died to win and defend and preserve our precious freedom?  </P> <P> For shame, Ronald Reagan.  </P> <P> TEMPLE S. HOUSTON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

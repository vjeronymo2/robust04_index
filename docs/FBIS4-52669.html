			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 10 (YONHAP) -- The United States and  North Korea have made considerable progress on holding a third  round of high-level talks despite thorny problems over the  changing of nuclear fuel rods at Yongbyon, a U.S. Government  official hinted Tuesday.    "North Korea had originally planned to begin changing  nuclear  fuel rods (at the 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon) on May 4, but  so far there has not been any information that it has been  carried out," said the official, who declined to be identified.    The reactor in question is an experimental one and therefore  no technical difficulties are expected, even if the refueling  plans are postponed, the official said.    "Pyongyang knows very well that U.S.-North Korean contacts  will be broken off if it forces the changing of fuel rods  without the presence of the IAEA (International Atomic Energy  Agency)," he said.    The official, however, declined to discuss whether Pyongyang  had informed Washington that it would delay its plans to change  the fuel rods.    The United States and North Korea had a working-level  contact  in New York on Monday. Kenneth Quinones, the State Department's  North Korea desk officer, represented Washington at the meeting.    Asked about the prospect for the third round of talks, the  official said the United States is hopeful.    "We firmly hope that (dialogue on holding the talks) has  reached the final phase," he noted.    Nevertheless, he said there would have to be many more  working-level contacts, indicating a continued verbal tug-of-war  between Washington and Pyongyang before the third round of talks  could be realized.    The official said he believed that North Korea and the IAEA  would "soon" resume negotiations.    "Once IAEA inspections begin, it would probably take about  one week," he said, recalling that IAEA Secretary-General Hans  Blix is expected to report back to the United Nations Security  Council on the progress in the North Korean nuclear row by  mid-May.    "The United States understands the technical position of the  IAEA and is fully supporting the IAEA in that respect," he added.</p>

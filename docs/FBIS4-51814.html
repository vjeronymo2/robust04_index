			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 25 (YONHAP) -- The Korea High-Speed  Rail Construction Authority (KHRC) announced Monday the list of  consortiums, comprised of eight local and eight foreign  companies, seeking the cellular system contract for the  Seoul-Pusan high-speed railway slated to open in 2002. The  Seoul-Pusan high-speed line will be the world's first to adopt a  time-division multiple access (TDMA) cellular system, widely  used by U.S. telecom companies in their cellular phone networks,  a KHRC spokesman said.    Existing bullet trains -- the TGV (Train a Grande Vitesse)  of  France, the ICE (Inter-City Express) of Germany and Sinkansen of  Japan -- all use the less sensitive analog technology.    The applicants are ASCOM of Switzerland (with participation  by Korea's Goldstar Information and Communications), Motorola of  the United States (together with Hantong Engineering), Siemens  of Germany (Siemens Korea), Ericsson GE of the United States  (Samsung Electronics and Kukje Electronics), AMCE and Union  Pacific of the United States (Ujin Electronics), AEG of Germany  (Hyundai Electronics) and Rohill of the Netherlands (Tongyang  Telecommuncations).    The KHRC will choose five successful companies by April 29  and send them RFP (Request For Proposal) so that it can name the  final awardees by year-end after screening their proposals from  June.</p>

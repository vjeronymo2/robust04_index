			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Rivals claim they underbid AT&amp;T for Saudi contract Controversy over the award by Saudi Arabia of a Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.7bn) telecommunications contract to AT&amp;T erupted into a bitter war of words yesterday, with rival suppliers claiming that they significantly underbid the US company. Two of the companies also alleged that technical evaluation of the bids was not completed before the contract was awarded earlier this week. The contract, one of the largest in telecoms history, is for the modernisation of the kingdom's telecommunications, including 1.5m new phone lines and a new cellular mobile network. All the losers - Northern Telecom of Canada, Alcatel of France, Siemens of Germany and Ericsson of Sweden - believe the contract was awarded on political grounds, following intense lobbying by the Clinton administration and Saudi concern not to alienate the US. Mr Graham Burke, Saudi Arabian general manager of Northern Telecom, said: 'We were all surprised by the outcome. Where I come from, you don't reward third-placed finishers.' The company claimed that its bid for the 1.5m telecoms lines amounted to Dollars 3.2bn, with a five-year installation period - as against AT&amp;T's winning bid of Dollars 3.9bn with a seven-year installation period. AT&amp;T dismissed the claims as 'naive', and said the Saudi telecommunications ministry stated that AT&amp;T won on cost, competence and technical superiority. Mr Dan Hesse, chief executive of AT&amp;T's international network systems, accepted that political pressure was a factor, but added: 'For many years the US government has not supported US companies as have our foreign competitors. Now that the US is also supporting American companies abroad, we are hearing these complaints.' At the opening of the bids for the initial tender last September, AT&amp;T's bid was significantly higher than those of Northern Telecom, Ericsson and Alcatel. Comparative and technical evaluation followed, but - the losers claim - was abandoned a month ago. 'All of sudden, the evaluation groups stopped, and we heard a rumour that the number of lines was to be increased from 500,000 to 1.5m - for which we were not invited to bid,' a senior Siemens executive said. The award, as part of the deal, of a contract for AT&amp;T to build a cellular mobile phone network to the pan-European GSM standard aroused particular resentment. AT&amp;T has only one other public GSM contract in progress, in the United Arab Emirates, whereas the other suppliers are well established. Siemens has already installed a private GSM network in the kingdom for the royal family.</p>

			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> MALL'S TENANTS BAFFLED BY LENGTHY RENOVATION;  </P> <P> RETAIL: THE BUENAVENTURA CENTER'S OWNERS REFUSE TO SAY HOW LONG THE WORK WILL  LAST AND WHETHER A SECOND FLOOR OR A NEW ANCHOR STORE WILL BE ADDED.  </P> <P> For nearly two years, construction crews have been drilling, pounding and  hammering away at Buenaventura Mall, the 26-year-old regional shopping center  in Ventura that is a landmark of western Ventura County.  </P> <P> On the face of it, the crews have made progress, installing attractive glass  ceilings and renovating the mall's center court and west wing. Next, they're  going to refurbish the east wing.  </P> <P> In the minds of many tenants and shoppers, however, the work being done at  Buenaventura Mall -- the name was changed in August from Buenaventura Plaza --  has created something else: a mystery.  </P> <P> Neither the center's 90 retailers nor members of the general public seem to  know the ultimate goal of the building project at the center, situated just off  the Ventura Freeway and bordered by Main Street, Mills Road and Telegraph Road.  </P> <P> Tenants -- some of whom say their businesses already have been seriously  damaged by the lengthy construction project -- say they have no idea when the  work will end. Some say they have heard it may continue for as long as another  four years.  </P> <P> The mystery has been fueled by the attitude of Buenaventura Mall's owner, the  MaceRich Co. of Santa Monica.  </P> <P> The company speaks of negotiations in progress but won't say whether this means  another department store will join the present anchors -- JC Penney and the  Broadway. Some merchants believe such an addition is needed.  </P> <P> Workers have sunk heavy pylons into the ground throughout much of the mall, but  management won't confirm or deny rumors that a second level of stores will be  added to the 825,000-square-foot center.  </P> <P> Most frustrating of all to some tenants and shoppers, MaceRich and Cayse  Osterlund, the mall's manager, will not say when the work will be completed.  </P> <P> "I can't comment on that," Osterlund said when asked about a report that  completion could be four years away.  </P> <P> In fact, some of Buenaventura's storekeepers -- and some of their customers --  are seriously questioning whether the improvements are worth all the dust and  din.  </P> <P> Since construction started, at least seven tenants have left the mall. One of  those who left did so because "it got so noisy people couldn't hear us on the  phone."  </P> <P> A tenant who has stayed, Dean Duke, manager of the mall's Radio Shack,  estimates his sales are off 10% due to customer confusion and inconvenience.  </P> <P> Danuta Burke, manager of the Miller's Outpost in the mall, says she has heard  customers complain "about the inside being dusty, and all the hammering and  clamoring and detours . . . I'm afraid a lot of people who used to shop here  are now going to The Oaks."  </P> <P> Burke is one of several Buenaventura Mall retailers who worry that they are  losing customers to The Oaks Mall, the Thousand Oaks center that is the  county's largest.  </P> <P> Jim Word, manager of the JC Penney store that anchors Buenaventura Mall's north  end, acknowledged having a soft sales month in September, but said, "It's hard  to say whether it was caused by the construction or the economy."  </P> <P> But, he added: "The construction -- especially the problems in the parking lot  -- hasn't really helped business."  </P> <P> Shoppers, too, say they've been inconvenienced by the project, which started in  February, 1989.  </P> <P> "I still come here occasionally, but I've been doing most of my shopping  elsewhere since the construction started a couple of years ago," said Randy  Bluhm of Camarillo. "The noise and all that definitely bothers me."  </P> <P> "One day I had to park by Penney's and walk a long way to get to the Hallmark  store. It was confusing," Pat Flanagan-Stelling of Ventura said, referring to  the parking lot on Mills Road, which until two weeks ago was fenced off to  create a storage area for construction equipment and building material.  </P> <P> She said she still shops at Buenaventura, "but not as often as I used to. Now I  also go to the Esplanade or The Oaks."  </P> <P> Buenaventura's manager, Osterlund, admitted receiving some complaints, but said  that's unavoidable under the circumstances.  </P> <P> "We've tried to appease our customers and tenants to the best of our ability,"  he said. He added that most of the work which tenants and customers have  complained about has been suspended until after the Christmas season.  </P> <P> Osterlund maintained that despite the soft economy, business at the center has  improved this year. But he refused to give figures -- and a number of tenants  questioned his report.  </P> <P> "I can say that our sales through August this year were up compared to last  year," Osterlund said. He conceded, however, that he does not receive reports  from Penney's or the Broadway, whose corporate parents do not disclose sales  results at individual stores.  </P> <P> As an example of the mystery that surrounds the work being done at the mall, an  artist's rendering displayed in the center court promises "an arched entry  crowned by a 45-foot-high glass canopy" and "a two-story-high skylit ceiling,  with parquet flooring, tile planters, tree grates and sconce light fixtures."  </P> <P> Nothing, however, is said about the two chief subjects of conjecture among the  mall's tenants -- whether a second floor of stores will be installed, and  whether one or more new department stores will be added.  </P> <P> Neither Osterlund nor officials at MaceRich would answer these questions.  </P> <P> The tenants, therefore, are left to wonder about the mall's future.  </P> <P> "They've been driving huge pylons into the ground, getting ready for the second  level," said Duke of Radio Shack. "They've said from the start that there would  be a second level. I've heard it will take four years before it's completed."  </P> <P> Word, Penney's manager, said he also has heard rumors, "but nothing definite,"  about plans to add a third department store.  </P> <P> "It would help a lot," he said. "We would especially welcome an upscale  department store. That would assure the viability of the center."  </P> <P> Some tenants said they have heard that not one but two department stores may be  added. Robinson's, Bullock's and Nordstrom are the names most frequently  mentioned as potential newcomers, these tenants said.  </P> <P> A MaceRich official who requested anonymity said, "Because of negotiations that  are now going on, I can tell you very little about our plans for Buenaventura."  He refused to elaborate.  </P> <P> MaceRich, which says it is the second-largest mall operator in California,  acquired Buenaventura Mall in 1987. The company is privately held and thus does  not have to divulge as much detailed information about its activities as  publicly held concerns do.  </P> <P> While most merchants at Buenaventura feel the improvements being made will help  them in the long run, some strongly criticize the way the renovations are being  carried out.  </P> <P> "Two things that they did really hurt us," Duke said. "For months, they closed  the main entrance on Mills Road. That confused and inconvenienced a lot of  people.  </P> <P> "Then they fenced off the parking lot to make a storage area for construction  equipment. Because of that, you couldn't drive directly from one end to the  other, between the Broadway and Penney's."  </P> <P> Duke said that in contrast to a significant drop in his store's business, sales  at other Radio Shacks in the county have been at least holding their own, even  in a near-recession.  </P> <P> "My feeling is that things are very slow in this mall because of all the work  that's been going on," he said. "I've been feeling the pinch since last March  or April."  </P> <P> Karen Baker, assistant manager of Plaza Travel &amp; Cruises, one of the  businesses that have left the mall since the renovations began, had three basic  complaints.  </P> <P> "First, they wanted to raise our rent considerably," she said. "Second, we do a  lot of business on the phone, and the noise got so bad we were constantly  telling people we'd have to call them back in five minutes. That didn't help  our business any.  </P> <P> "Third, the noise and dirt were so bad in the east wing, where we were located,  that it discouraged foot traffic." Plaza Travel has now moved to Telephone Road  Plaza, about a half-mile east of the Buenaventura Mall.  </P> <P> Osterlund refused to comment about tenants that have left or about how many  vacancies exist in Buenaventura. He pointed out, however, that several new  stores have recently moved in or signed leases for space in the east wing,  which is vacant while being renovated.  </P> <P> Some Buenaventura tenants are reluctant to discuss how they've been affected by  the construction.  </P> <P> "My attorneys have told me not to comment," said Tom Van Gundy, manager of the  Van Gundy &amp; Sons jewelry store, which recently was moved from the east to  the west side of the center court.  </P> <P> Merchants at the center's southern end, toward Main Street, say they have been  affected less than others.  </P> <P> "We've had some noise and access problems, but on the whole it hasn't been  detrimental," said Lina Kalbak, manager of Big 5 Sporting Goods. She added, "I  trust they'll let us know if they're going to double-deck our end, however."  </P> <P> Farther north, near Radio Shack, Tina Wilson, manager of the Shades Galore  sunglasses stand, said she is in an especially good position to gauge foot  traffic.  </P> <P> "It's still slow, even though both entrances are now open," she said. "But at  least the smoke and pounding are gone for the time being."  </P></p>

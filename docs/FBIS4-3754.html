			<p>BFN     [Text] Panjin city has adopted measures to help staff  members and workers overcome their living difficulties to  safeguard social stability. Since the beginning of 1993, there  have been more than 4,000 households that are encountering  living difficulties in Panjin city. The city party committee  and the city people's government have continuously paid  attention to successfully dealing with the problems encountered  by staff members and workers in life and employment. They have  issued the certificate to staff members and workers whose per  capita income is under 60 yuan and who may enjoy the social  relief in various fields only by presenting this certificate.  Since the beginning of 1993, the city has successively raised  almost 1 million yuan of funds that have been used for subsidies  and relief to over 1,700 staff members and workers who are faced  with living difficulties. By increasing the variety of new  products and implementing the policies on preferential  treatment, the city has also reinforced the insurance system for  unemployment and retirement in an effort to fundamentally deal  with the living problems of staff members and workers. In 1993,  the city opens more than 100 economic entities and enterprises  that began the production and operation of more than 30 new  projects and accommodated more than 6,800 lay-off staff members  and workers as well as their jobless sons and daughters. The  city has enforced the policies on preferential treatment among  the staff members and workers who were laid off for a long time  by encouraging them to open self-employed businesses and by  giving consideration to them in the fields of workshops, funds,  and industrial and commercial taxes. Meanwhile, the city has  also enhanced the insurance system in unemployment and  retirement. The per capita relief and retirement payments for  all jobless personnel and retired staff members and workers  across the city are respectively 90 yuan and 130 yuan each  month. The city has invested 2.36 million yuan in building over  300 production bases and organizations for the unemployed staff  members and workers to provide for and help themselves by  engaging in production. The number of enterprises that have  suspended production or are in a state of semi-suspension  throughout the city went from 132 in the past to 14 at present  and the number of laid-off staff members and workers showed a 60  percent decrease.</p>

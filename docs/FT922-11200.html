			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Tecs pressure Shephard on training policy THE GOVERNMENT must decide whether its training priority for young people is guaranteeing a place to everybody or offering quality training, Mrs Gillian Shephard, the new employment secretary, has been told by the leaders of training and enterprise councils. G10, the group of Tec chairmen that represents the movement to the government, made clear at its first meeting with Mrs Shephard that it wanted to change its relationship with the government. Before the general election, relations between Tecs and the Department of Employment were soured after heated negotiations over funding for 1992-93. The government has reduced funding for many of the programmes operated by Tecs, including Youth Training and Employment Training, the scheme for unemployed adults. Tecs - not all of which have yet settled their budgets  - are obliged to guarantee a training place to all young people who want one. This year many are claiming that the quality of training will suffer because of the cuts. Many fear they will be unable to guarantee training places to all young people. Tecs want more freedom to tailor programmes at a local level. According to a confidential memo of the meeting with Mrs Shephard, held 10 days ago, G10 said Tecs wanted to influence policy. It told Mrs Shephard that the strength of Tecs was developing effective local initiatives. G10 said the government should fund Investors in People, the Tec-operated scheme to improve training for people in work. At present, Tecs have no specific funds for the project. It is understood they want about Pounds 20m to fund the plan. The memo said the meeting was cordial. Mrs Shephard 'warmly endorsed' the Tec concept and said she hoped they would be 're-invigorated'.

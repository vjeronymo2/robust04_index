			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / Commission payments challenged COMMISSION payments to financial services sales agents should be replaced by fees paid by consumers, the Law Society said yesterday. In a submission to the Securities and Investments Board, the main investment regulator, the society said: 'The investment intermediary with the strength of character to ignore the fact that one investment will pay more commission than another is bound to be rare. 'A producer can compensate for a poor investment record, and get products sold against those with a better performance, by paying more commission.' The submission is a response to SIB proposals to modify the sale of retail financial services and to the polarisation rule, which requires sales agents either to sell the products of a single provider or to sell independently the best products of a group of providers. Members of the Law Society who sell financial products must pass on any commission to their clients. It admitted that the SIB was unlikely to go so far as to ban commission payments. However, it urged the regulator to adopt proposals to make it more clear to potential customers whether the sales agent was working for a single company or could provide independent advice. It also opposed proposals to bring solicitors into the net of a single self-regulatory organisation for retail financial services.</p>

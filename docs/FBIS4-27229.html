			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] In cooperation with the communist Vietnamese, the  United States began its second war against the Cambodian nation  and people right after the elections held in Cambodia by UNTAC  [UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia]. The military campaigns  launched last July and August to seize the Stoung and Phnum  Chhat areas were financed by the United States. Meanwhile,  France was charged with the air transportation of arms,  ammunition, artilleries, and the wounded and UNTAC and Australia  were in charge of radio communications.    The recent operations to seize Anlung Veng and Pailin in  Battambang Province were also launched with financial aid and  weapons from the United States, the allies, and the communist  Vietnamese.    These military campaigns launched by the United States were  just the covert, undeclared war. After suffering serious defeats  on the Anlung Veng and Pailin battlefields, they started the  open war in Cambodia. Over the past weeks, the Clinton  administration hurriedly sent officials from the State and  Defense Departments one after another to Phnom Penh to arrange  the supply of weapons and ammunition to join with the communist  Vietnamese in waging war in Cambodia.    Winston Lord, U.S. assistant secretary of state for East  Asian and Pacific affairs, announced time and again that war had  to be waged in Cambodia. A U.S. diplomat also said that the  United States should think about waging war in Cambodia. This  is tantamount to declaring a second U.S. war against the  Cambodian nation and people.    In what situation is the United States declaring war in  Cambodia? Which forces are being used as a springboard for  waging this war in Cambodia?    I. The United States is declaring this war in a situation  when all Cambodian people both inside and outside the country  are jointly opposing the elements rekindling the Vietnamese war  of aggression against Cambodia, and demanding national  reconciliation so as to restore peace and security in Cambodia.  This movement is surging thunderously. No force can stop it.    In such a situation, how can the United States rekindle the  war in Cambodia?    II. In the 1970-75 war, the United States used the Lon Nol  forces as the springboard for waging its aggressive war against  Cambodia.    In comparison, the Lon Nol forces are better than the  present  U.S. puppets -- border bandits -- and Vietnamese puppets in  Phnom Penh. The Lon Nol forces had enough to eat, quite proper  clothing, and some political bases in Cambodia.    In this second war, the United States uses its puppets --  border bandits -- and communist Vietnamese puppets as the  springboard.    A. It is no need to explain much about the border bandits  because the Cambodian people know well that they are the  lifelong slaves and henchmen of the United States and its allies.    B. As for the communist Vietnamese puppets:    1. They are elements installed at gunpoint by over 250,000  aggressor troops of the communist Vietnamese. They have served  the communist Vietnamese in killing countless Cambodians over  the past 15 years. The Cambodian people know them as traitors  to the nation and people and the out-and-out lackeys of the  Vietnamese communists. The Cambodian people hate them and have  jointly attacked them for the past 15 years.    2. The communist Vietnamese puppets are thoroughly corrupt.  They have competed against one another in selling out  everything, state land, buildings, tables, chairs, and so forth.  In that case, what will happen to the money and supplies that  the United States is giving them for waging war in Cambodia?    This shows that the springboard that the United States is  using in waging war in Cambodia is rotten like [words  indistinct]. Thus, the United States will never be able to  fortify this springboard.    For this reason, in this second war, the United States will  certainly face the same fate as it did on 17 April 1975.    The Cambodian people are shouting: United States, do not  wage  a second war in Cambodia!</p>

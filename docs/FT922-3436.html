			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Civilian named as Thai premier MR ANAND Panyarachun, a respected businessman and former diplomat, was re-appointed as prime minister of Thailand last night by a surprise edict from the royal palace which paves the way for new elections. The appointment is likely to provide at least a temporary solution to the country's two-month political crisis, which culminated in the shooting of 49 pro-democracy demonstrators by troops last month and the resignation of Gen Suchinda Kraprayoon, the previous premier. 'I understand that my main duty will be to organise the elections,' Mr Anand said last night. He said that he would probably dissolve the existing parliament in two or three weeks, and that his government would last a total of about four months. He said he would attempt to repair the damage done to the economy by the violence, although it would take time to restore the vulnerable tourism industry. 'The economic fundamentals are still strong, so it will not take us very long to improve the local economy,' Mr Anand said. The proposed delay in the dissolution of parliament will allow time for military leaders to testify next week before a committee of MPs investigating the violence. Yesterday parliament gave final approval to constitutional amendments demanded by the opposition and the demonstrators, including a provision that the premiership be restricted to elected members of parliament. Mr Anand has not been elected and the amendments will become law as soon as they are printed in the royal gazette. Opposition politicians want to reduce permanently the influence of the military in politics, but they fear that new elections will not necessarily overturn the pro-military majority in parliament. Vote-buying is common in rural areas. Mr Anand said Mr Arthit Urairat, the speaker of parliament, telephoned him at 5.30pm Bangkok time yesterday and asked him to be prime minister to break a political deadlock: the governing coalition of pro-military parties were backing a candidate unacceptable to the Thai people, while the opposition was supporting an acceptable candidate but did not have enough seats. In a statement released later, Mr Arthit said Thailand was facing a crisis and the appointment of a poorly chosen prime minister 'is a decision which could lead to violence and catastrophe'. He said his solution would return sovereignty to the people. 'I have carefully considered the situation,' he said. 'For all parties to compromise and for democracy to prosper I propose Anand Panyarachun.' It was unclear whether the surprise appointment had been initiated by the speaker or the king. Shortly before the announcement Air Chief Marshal Somboon Rahong, the controversial pro-military candidate whose appointment could have led to renewed demonstrations, told reporters that he would be the new prime minister. A celebration party was even being prepared at his house. Air Chief Marshal Somboon, however, said after hearing of Mr Anand's appointment that he was relieved that a burden had been lifted from his shoulders. 'I am really happy,' he said. Mr Anand won praise from foreign investors and local businessmen for economic reforms and a drive against corruption in his year-long tenure as prime minister between the military coup d'etat of February 1991 and the elections in March this year.</p>

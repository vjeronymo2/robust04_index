			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Dr. Mohammad Javad Larijani, Tehran Majles </F> deputy and member of the Supreme National Security Council:  "The Satellite, Industry, and Culture"]    [Excerpts] 1. Let us comprehend the matter correctly. The  controversy is not whether the satellite or its dish antennae  are good or bad, lawful or unlawful! The question is of a  certain form of social behavior. [passage omitted]    2. Let us discuss the matter of social conduct. Can anyone  deny the deleterious effects of satellite transmissions on the  mental and moral growth of youth? [passage omitted]    3. Now we come to the most crucial question: What should be  done in the face of serious moral threats resulting from the  proliferation of the various foreign transmissions. First of  all, we should be aware that all of us, not only the government,  but all individuals have a responsibility. If we accept this,  we can be assured that not only can we help to stem this scourge  but also to achieve a high level of success. This is only  possible if all of us consider ourselves responsible, rise up  against it, and carry out our duties.    The people should gain enough knowledge and information on  the subject. This is a momentous obligation for the scholars,  intelligentsia, and farsighted individuals in our society that  should be conveyed by our mass media: radio, television, the  press, the Majles and so on so that the message is conveyed to  the masses.    Orators and preachers should enlighten the people on the  issue at every opportunity. The people should not consider this  issue as simply sensitivity toward all modernism [preceding word  in English]. [passage omitted]    4. Should the government interfere in this matter? There  should not be the slightest doubt. This is because the  government is not a mere gendarme in an Islamic system to  prevent murder and theft. It also has the responsibility of  combating base thinking to maintain the moral wellbeing of  society.    It is precisely for this purpose that a guardian has two  kinds of jurisdiction: The first is that which bestows power on  him and the second is to guide the people. For the second, it  is imperative that a guardian should be a pious and devout  theological scholar so that he has the necessary ability to  guide.    What can the government do in this matter? Initially, it can  make the people more aware of the issue and at a secondary level  it should formulate certain useful laws and then compile  regulations for the implementation of those laws. Perhaps it  may not be so difficult to draw up a guidance program with the  help of the government. The doubt lies in whether the  government is able or qualified for such conduct, that is,  whether it can ban the use of programs carried by foreign  satellites.    Regarding its legal authority, there is no ambiguity on this  matter in the Constitution. Even in the democratic systems  based on liberalism [preceding word in English], which on  principle should be indifferent to values, the issue of  safeguarding public decency is an exception. It is for this  reason that in many of the American states there are  restrictions on the establishment of gambling dens, brothels,  and how much bodily exposure is permissible. Similarly, a man  cannot have more than one wife at a time and vice versa.  However, the implications of public decency are unwritten in the  West, but in our system they are very clear, sensible and in  accordandance with the shari'ah.    Some people do not consider it proper that the government  should impose a ban, even though there is no legal hindrance.  Their main reasoning has two axes: The first is that banning  the public from acquiring these programs will only increase  their curiosity, and the second is that the government cannot  impose laws on this matter, whether at the level of our current  technology or when the acquisition of such programs becomes  easier. It cannot go from house to house to supervise the  implementation of its laws. [passage omitted]    5. What is the prospect for the future? One of the  characteristics of our great contemporary revolution is that of  operational information. Perhaps information in itself may not  have progressed greatly, but it has maintained its swift and  evolutionary course and it is the operational information that  brought about revolutionary upheavals. [passage omitted]    6. To sum up: A. The future of communications is not in  the proliferation of the use of the satellites by individuals.  Instead, an important development will be the establishment of  informational highways with ease, which will place a massive  capability on informational traffic within reach of the home or  workplace of individuals with the help of fiber optics. This  information will not consist solely of television programs, but  will also open up other vast horizons.    B. In the last few years of the 20th century, there is a  suitable opportunity for the dear people of our country to be  aware of these developments and to learn the correct and useful  way of utilizing the current facilities. One should admit that  the correct way of utilizing radio and television has not been  spelled out to the people. One should not think that this  consists merely of switching equipment on and off or knowing  directions! If modern communications equipment is utilized with  awareness (regarding information pollution), it can certainly be  said that the usefulness of human life can be extended manifold.    This means that if today individuals can abandon their  negligence in this field, their apparent lifespan of 60-70 years  can become more useful than a mere existence of a few thousand  years or more! In fact, age is a treasure that needs to be  explored!    C. Just as it has been mentioned in the country's plan for  economic and social development, the Communications Department  should prepare itself to join the current modern trend of  information. The social, cultural, and scientific departments  of the country should prepare the people for optimum utilization  and on how to remain safe from the harmful effects of satellite  programs. A legal ban on the use of communications satellites,  which is a temporary technology for individual use, will stress  the cultural aspects of those programs that are permitted. Of  course, the Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran  should transmit a selection of these programs some hours daily  for the benefit of the public.</p>

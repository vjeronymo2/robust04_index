			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> POLICE ROUTINELY RELOCATE TRANSIENTS, LAWYER SAYS  </P> <P> San Diego police officers, under pressure from downtown merchants, often pick  up transients and relocate them to remote areas, an attorney for one of two  officers charged with kidnaping and robbing illegal aliens said in court  Wednesday.  </P> <P> James Gattey, an attorney with the Police Officers Assn., said Officers Lloyd  J. Hoff and Richard P. Schaaf were simply following general police practices  when they removed transients from the downtown and are not guilty of kidnaping  and robbing a small group of undocumented Latino workers last August.  </P> <P> "They will locate them to areas that they know they will stay," he said in his  opening remarks at the trial in San Diego Superior Court.  </P> <P> "This is a practice," Gattey said. "There is not an official sanction. It's not  something you read about. It's employed and has been employed by San Diego  police for many years. It is a common police practice."  </P> <P> However, his contention that the Police Department condones such a policy drew  ire from at least one civil rights and Latino activist, who called the practice  unfair.  </P> <P> "Those policies are racist, and it's the manifestation of selective law  enforcement on the part of the San Diego Police Department," Herman Baca,  chairman of the Committee on Chicano Rights, said in a telephone interview  after Wednesday's court proceedings. "It's standard policy and has been for a  long time."  </P> <P> Hoff, 27, and Schaaf, 29, both on voluntary leave from the department, face  maximum sentences of life in prison if convicted on the felony charges. They  are accused of kidnaping three illegal aliens for the purpose of robbery, and  of robbing two of the men.  </P> <P> But Gattey, who represents Hoff, told the jury that "nobody was transporting  anybody for the purpose of robbery."  </P> <P> With crowded jails and complaining shopkeepers, Gattey said, officers working  the downtown beat often face a dilemma in dealing with known troublemakers.  </P> <P> "What do they do in response to the department's saying we have got to get  these people out of here?" Gattey asked the jury. "What do we do? They will  locate them to other areas."  </P> <P> However, one of the plaintiffs, Arturo Romero Garcia, testified that Hoff and  Schaaf took him from a downtown trolley stop, stole $35 in cash from his  wallet, and abandoned him in a dark, isolated area near railroad tracks.  </P> <P> Garcia, who is in jail for auto burglary, has given police a variety of  pseudonyms and birth dates on various occasions, and he admitted during a  preliminary hearing that he was once a heavy heroin user.  </P> <P> Rolando Carrera Reyes, an undocumented worker, is expected to testify today  that the two officers, in separate incidents, took him from downtown, robbed  him and dropped him off in a remote area. Like Garcia, he has a criminal record  and was arrested at the preliminary hearing on six outstanding warrants,  including one for possession of marijuana.  </P> <P> During the preliminary hearing, Carrera Reyes testified that Hoff struck him  several times in the testicles with his flashlight, tossed his shoes in a  puddle and then pushed him into the water. Another alleged victim, Ramiro  Rodriguez, has not been located.  </P> <P> Everett Bobbitt, the attorney for Schaaf, did not give an opening statement.  But he has objected to Schaaf's involvement in the proceedings, saying that no  one testified against his client during the preliminary hearing.  </P> <P> Garcia and Carrera Reyes claim that Hoff was the key perpetrator.  </P> <P> But Gattey cited discrepancies in the accounts given by Garcia and Carrera  Reyes: The amounts of money they said was stolen has changed on different  occasions, and they have given conflicting birth dates and places of birth.  </P></p>

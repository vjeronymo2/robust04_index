			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Rita Tsang] </F>   [Text] The government's release of the White Paper on  Sino-British talks failed to grab Hong Kong people's  imagination, a SUNDAY HONGKONG STANDARD street poll held in  Central yesterday reveals. None of those polled had actually  read the document. We asked Saturday shoppers these three  questions following the release on Thursday of the White Paper,  giving details of talks over the territory's future in  preparation for reunification with the mainland in 1997:    -- Have you read the White Paper?    -- Do you feel that China stalled the talks?    -- What do you feel the next move should be in the current  standoff between the Chinese and the British sides?    Marie Ng: "I didn't read the White Paper. I think both sides  are responsible for the talks. The Chinese government is a  dictatorship. Although the British have given a good  impression, we know nothing about the negotiations. I hope they  will go back to the table soon."    Rainbow Chow: "I didn't read the White Paper. I don't know  which side should bear the responsibility, but I don't like the  Chinese officials because they are always critical and  ungracious. I hope both sides will open talks soon."    Danny Law: "I didn't read the White Paper. I felt that both  sides stalled the talks. There seems to be no way to come an  agreement if other countries can intervene."    Collins Barron: "I haven't read the White Paper yet. Both  sides should bear responsibility. I hope the negotiations will  be opened as early as possible."    Eric Winkler: "I didn't read the White Paper. This is a  cultural misunderstanding, so the two sides need to understand  each other. There is not much chance for China to improve its  democracy policy because Deng Xiaoping is the boss now. I  really hope the two sides will be back to the talks in future."    James Lam: "I didn't read the White Paper. I think that they  had better stop arguing and both sides should compromise and  make mutual concessions in order to ensure stability and  prosperity in the territory after 1997."    Ken O'Byrne: "I didn't read the White Paper. Both sides  should take responsibility because different people have  different ideas and opinions. I wish the talks would go ahead  soon."    Merlida Dallo: "I didn't read the paper. I think China  stalled the talks and should bear all the responsibility. I  don't trust the Chinese government."</p>

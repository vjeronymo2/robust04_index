			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Racal demerger heightens chance of a bid THE DEMERGER of Chubb Security from Racal Electronics, which was announced yesterday, is likely to lead to a period of active but not necessarily fruitful courtship. After Racal Electronics last year distributed its 80 per cent stake in Vodafone, the cellular telephone group, bid speculation began, with Chubb the main focus of attention. The bid duly came from Williams Holdings but was repelled. Slide rules will again be run over the demerged Chubb and Racal. Being stand-alone businesses, the theory is that more predators will be interested in making an offer. Racal is proposing to consolidate five old shares into one new Racal share and give shareholders one new Chubb share. But the Chubb business has been considerably strengthened since Williams had a tilt at the group. Ironically this may mean that the shares are more fully priced and therefore less likely to attract the suitor. Most dramatic has been the sharp increase in cash generation and a palpable increase in management focus on cost cutting that has led to a sharp increase in profits, particularly in Chubb. Debt, which stood at Pounds 225m when Sir Ernest Harrison decided to postpone the last proposed demerger of Chubb, has now been almost halved - depending on what conversion rate is taken for the dollar debt. As a result Racal should have no problem servicing its borrowings without the benefit of the cash generative powers of Chubb. Chubb has also gone some way along the path of cutting costs through improved purchasing and the closure of some of its 30 manufacturing sites. The early benefit of this programme has meant the flotation prospectus can forecast operating profits of Pounds 28m in the 28 weeks to October and pre-tax profits after exceptional items of Pounds 21m, up 61 per cent on the previous year. Mr David Peacock, the new Chubb chief executive, has recognised that the Chubb brand names could be better exploited to gain a greater share of a Pounds 7bn global market. Racal Electronics, without Chubb, is a more complicated picture, and the group is not forecasting half year profits at this stage. More than a third of the group's sales are in data communications, which has been a problem area since the group made a late entry into analogue modems in the early 1980s. Before profitability returns to this division, Racal is likely to be hampered and possibly vulnerable to a bid. Mr David Elsbury, the chief executive, believes the corner has been turned after a repositioning in areas of higher market growth. It is now cash positive but has yet to prove it can deliver margin improvement. Elsewhere, the group's radio division - one of the original foundations of Sir Ernest's empire - has broadened beyond military applications and should benefit from continuing high research and development expenditure. Other businesses, like data networks, still require time to develop beyond the start up phase to full profit potential, making valuation of the group something of a difficult task.</p>

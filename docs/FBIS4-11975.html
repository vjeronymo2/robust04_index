			<p>BFN     [Text] Maronite Patriarch Mar Nasrallah Butrus Sfayr stated  that the Christians' abstention from taking part in the state's  activities is due to the imbalance in the distribution of roles  following the settlement accord that put an end to the war. He  pointed out that the state has not treated everyone equally and  has failed to make Christians feel that it cares about them as  much as other citizens.    He noted that except for faith in God, freedom is Lebanon's  one and only asset. He pointed out that all complaints reflect  violations of the principle of national accord.    Patriarch Sfayr's remarks came in his Easter message to the  Lebanese today.</p>

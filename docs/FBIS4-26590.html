			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 23 (XINHUA) -- China is happy to see  the positive developments on the Korean nuclear issue and  appreciates the wise attitude adopted by the parties concerned  for a peaceful settlement of the issue, Foreign Ministry  Spokesman Wu Jianmin said here today.    U.S. President Clinton announced today that the U.S. would  hold the third round of talks with DPRK in Geneva in early July  to seek an overall improvement of relations between the two  countries, Wu noted at a press conference here this afternoon.    He continued that according to Clinton, the U.S. would also  stop pushing for sanctions against DPRK in the UN Security  Council. Meanwhile, DPRK and ROK have reached an agreement on  holding preliminary talks for a summit meeting between them.    Wu said, China is happy to see these positive developments  on  the Korean nuclear issue and appreciates the wise attitude  adopted and positive efforts made by the parties concerned for a  peaceful settlement of this issue.    The spokesman stressed that dialogue, instead of exerting  pressure, is the basic way for a peaceful and proper settlement  of the Korean nuclear issue. "This conforms to the interests of  all parties and serves peace and stability on the peninsula."    China sincerely hopes that all parties concerned will  treasure and seize upon this important turning point, persist in  consultation and dialogue with an equal, pragmatic and sincere  approach and make constructive efforts to bring about a  denuclearized, peaceful and stable Korean peninsula, he said.</p>

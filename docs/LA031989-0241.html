			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TURPIN'S COLUMNS  </P> <P> Heartfelt congratulations to retiring editor Dick Turpin and his successor,  Dick Barnes. Mr. Turpin's retirement plans, which include travel and the  "enjoyment of time," refer to a possible book based on his rough-and-ready  experiences, which I surely hope will materialize.  </P> <P> I'm much indebted to him for opening up a whole new world for me -- i.e. real  estate about which I knew nothing until I started to read his section  regularly.  </P> <P> SHERRY TERZIAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Urban policy undermining Bush campaign CONFIDENCE in President George Bush's ability to manage the severe urban problems of the US is being eroded to the point where it could jeopardise his bid for re-election. The message of several recent public opinion polls, including one in the Washington Post yesterday, is that the administration's attempt to blame inner-city unrest on the liberal Democratic programmes of the 1960s is falling on deaf ears. The Post survey found 55 per cent ascribing the principal blame to the perceived policies of urban neglect practised by the Reagan and Bush administrations. Two thirds thought a new approach to urban issues was required, and there was widespread doubt about Mr Bush's ability to produce one. Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the presumptive Democratic candidate, scored higher than the president as a man more able to to deal with problems of race relations, poverty and the cities. Mr Ross Perot, the main prospective independent candidate, outscored both as the man more likely to improve the economy and unemployment, with Mr Bush last in both categories. This did not much change the national balance of current preferences among the three, which remains near-level. Mr Bush was given 33 per cent, Mr Clinton 29 per cent and Mr Perot 28 per cent, compared with a 36:31:30 split in the Post's April survey. But the Bush campaign had nakedly hoped that the main effect of the Perot boom would been the relegation of Mr Clinton to third place, thus embarrassing the Democrats. The evidence is that he is drawing from Mr Bush's core support as much as from Mr Clinton's and, in the south west and west, probably more from the president. Mr Bush's apparent inability to establish leadership concerns his campaign managers. This explains why he is now spending much time in deprived urban districts, including one in Washington yesterday. But these tours to places he rarely used to visit are being widely dismissed as little more than 'photo opportunities'. His administration is continuing to dribble out announcements that extra federal funds are being earmarked to repair the destruction in Los Angeles, including a further Dollars 600m in Federal Home Loan Board advances. Even so, the gap between administration programmes and urban demands continues to grow. The US conference of mayors has called for a Dollars 35bn action plan  -roughly 10 times what Mr Bush has promised. There is also a sense that the bipartisan spirit of co-operation by the president and Congress, evident at the start of the week, is beginning to come asunder. In private, even some senior Republicans are acidulous about their president's performance. One prominent senator is preparing to propose that Mr Bush (and Mr Clinton and Mr Perot) be grilled individually on television by the Democratic Senator Kent Conrad and the Republican Warren Rudman, both of whom announced their retirement recently on the grounds that Washington was failing to come to grips with critical budgetary and social issues. That senator was not sanguine that the president would acquit himself well in such a session. In fact, the Bush campaign has yet to commit itself to the televised debates by the presidential candidates that have been a big feature of most elections since 1960. Mr William Safire, the independent-minded conservative columnist, wrote yesterday in the New York Times, apropos vice-presidential candidates: 'The weak end of the Bush-Quayle team is Mr Bush, who should be grateful that the confident Dan Quayle is not trying to dump him.'</p>

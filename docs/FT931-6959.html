			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / International Company News: Astra chief quits after dispute over policy DR PETER Sjostrand resigned abruptly yesterday as executive vice-president and chief financial officer of Astra, the leading Swedish pharmaceutical group, writes Christopher Brown-Humes. His departure stems from a personal disagreement with Mr Hakan Mogren, Astra chief executive, over the future division of responsibilities. Neither the company nor Dr Sjostrand were willing to elaborate. Dr Sjostrand, 46, joined Astra in 1975 and has been on the group's executive committee for the past 15 years. He was secretary of the board between 1976 and 1988 and a deputy of the board since then.</p>

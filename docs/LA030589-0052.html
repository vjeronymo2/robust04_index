			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> YUPPIES ADOPT U.S. OF '50S;  </P> <P> SINGAPORE TAKES TO BALLROOM DANCING  </P> <P> Chinese yuppies who never selected a song from a jukebox are discovering the  American '50s with a zeal that has made ballroom dancing the hottest craze in  town.  </P> <P> Sipping malteds at a soda fountain while Elvis Presley croons and examining  fenders from an era when a teen with a Thunderbird was king are new pastimes  for workaholic Singaporeans.  </P> <P> "Everything seemed so much simpler then," said Lester Chue, a busy real estate  agent who finds time each day for a "Blue Hawaii Hamburger" or "Love Me Tender  Steak" at Yesterday's, the newest hot spot overflowing with nostalgia.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Deprived as Teens  </P> <P> Unlike Americans remembering their youth with cars and cash, Southeast Asian  adults who were teens during that bygone era recall lining up for noodles at  hawker stands and dreams of bicycles for transport.  </P> <P> Confined to gramophones and a family radio in the aftermath of World War II  with Singapore part of Malaysia under British colonial rule, Jenny Ling  recalled her parents exhorting her to switch off such enticers as Jerry Lee  Lewis blasting "Great Balls of Fire."  </P> <P> "We didn't have the cars and other trappings enjoyed by American kids," said  Ling, now a middle-aged mother. "But we all loved rock 'n' roll, and I still  do."  </P> <P> Zack Harris, enterprising assistant manager at Yesterday's, recreates the '50s  for those too young to remember, adults old enough to cherish their own  memories and both generations intrigued by such American artifacts as Wurlitzer  jukeboxes, Remington typewriters, gum ball machines and vintage pumps  advertising gasoline for 33 cents a gallon.  </P> <P> With the walls plastered with the fenders of the most-coveted cars and a band  sporting pompadours belting out the hits of Fats Domino, Bill Haley and the  Comets, the Everly Brothers, Chuck Berry, the Four Seasons, Ricky Nelson, Buddy  Holly and others who became overnight sensations, even Harris is amazed at the  instant success.  </P> <P> "We never thought we'd be selling more milkshakes than liquor," he said. "But  this is a place where anyone caught up in the hectic pace of six-day weeks can  slow down, have fun and feel good."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Oldies, New Releases Mixed  </P> <P> Disc jockeys spin oldies as regularly as latest releases from Michael Jackson,  Madonna and Bruce Springsteen. Video stores sell out discs and tapes of one-hit  or few-hit wonders as fast as they are restocked.  </P> <P> It is a rare shopping center that is not blaring the sound track from "La  Bamba," the movie about '50s singer Ritchie Valens who was killed in a plane  crash. The film played to packed houses for months.  </P> <P> Frustrated beauticians eager to create elegant hairdos complain over the  popularity of ponytails. Dance teachers are overwhelmed by demand for ballroom  dancing lessons, particularly the jitterbug and acrobatic rock 'n' roll.  </P> <P> Young professionals view ballroom dancing as a social skill, singles seeking  romance cherish hopes of an attractive partner, and the older set kept away  from discos by the feverish pace find rhythms they can enjoy.  </P> <P> "When I started lessons I thought I'd never make it," said bank vice president  K. W. Teh, 52, as he guided his 20-year-old daughter through the cha-cha. "Now  it's clear there is no age limitation on dancing."  </P> <P> Dance schools have skyrocketed, with eight catering to 14,000 students like Lee  Wye Choo, a businesswoman who said she has spent "the equivalent of a one-carat  diamond ring" on lessons.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Intrigued by Glamour  </P> <P> Lee, 23, said she is intrigued by the glamour, with men in polished black  dancing shoes twirling partners in flared skirts in disciplined but graceful  movements.  </P> <P> Other zealots said they have given up all other hobbies to finance dancing  lessons. Soo Lee, a transport company executive director, said she has  abandoned gardening and scuba diving to perfect the jitterbug, rock 'n' roll  and jive she loves best.  </P> <P> Sunny Low, a dance teacher for 32 years, said the renewed ardor is back to  stay.  </P> <P> "People thought that if they could get onto the disco floor and shake their  bodies they would be all right, but that's all dying now and discos are  changing," Low said. "The new ones are capitalizing on ballroom dancing."  </P></p>

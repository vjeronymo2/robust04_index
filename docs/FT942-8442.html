			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Limit to Irish waiting game Sinn Fein will squeeze much propaganda out of the 20 questions it sent to the British government last Friday. The answers will be treated in the same fashion. That was the purpose of the exercise. The political front of the Irish Republican Army will derive raw material for its constant public relations offensive from the commendably robust reply prepared for it in London yesterday. As expected, Britain restated its known position. The government could not afford to show any give, nor did it. If Sinn Fein/IRA is true to form, questions and British commentary alike will be deployed as evidence of the 'reasonableness' of the armed republicans' cause and methods. Then the terrorists will carry on shooting and bombing as usual. Wait a minute. The above prognostication jars. It is not in tune. It differs from the conventional wisdom. Officials and ministers in London, Dublin and Belfast have recently begun to sing a familiar song. There is an evident longing for peace, they warble. We are at last reaching the end of the period of terrorism that began a quarter of a century ago. The Northern Ireland secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, exudes confidence in the peace process. The Irish prime minister, Mr Albert Reynolds, has long spoken as if an early ceasefire was probable. His foreign secretary, Mr Dick Spring, talked yesterday morning of clearing the logjam within the next few days. Even the president of Sinn Fein, Mr Gerry Adams, speaks as if we had reached the end-game. Perhaps we have, but there is no telling how long the final agony will last. The IRA could lay down its arms tomorrow, if it chose. Equally, it could continue the 'armed struggle' for the rest of this year, or another five years, or another generation. In a new book* on the province published on Monday Kevin Boyle and Tom Hadden, academics born in Ulster, suggest that the security forces 'now appear to have moved towards a strategy of containment pending the achievement of some form of political accommodation'. Equally it might be said that the IRA has set itself the limited objective of maintaining its present level of operations in the hope of securing an eventual British withdrawal. 'Seen in these terms, both sides appear to have the capacity to continue indefinitely,' say Boyle and Hadden. Much de-pends on how long it takes for the message implicit in the Irish-British declaration of December 15 1993 to sink in. Its essence is that the prime ministers of the two countries, Mr Reynolds and Mr John Major, have determined that if Sinn Fein wants to be treated as a constitutional political party it must first renounce violence. As Mr Reynolds said on Sunday, 'it also requires acceptance that, where you have two communities, political structures cannot be based on simple majoritarianism'. The IRA/Sinn Fein will doubtless search for differences between Mr Reynolds's 'clarifications' of the joint declaration and last night's British commentary on its 20 questions. It is not clear how assiduously the two governments have worked to compare notes in advance, but the assumption must be that their responses do not deviate from the principles of the December declaration. Just one of the IRA's 20 questions seemed to Sir Patrick to be on a point of genuine textual ambiguity. It was answered accordingly. The rest were grouped under various tags, such as whether they sought to reopen negotiations on the declaration, or whether they were mere repetitions of previous positions. If the optimists are right, the armed nationalists will now perceive that their only hope of achieving anything like a united Ireland lies in the peaceful persuasion of a majority of the people of Ulster. This argument is doubtless being deployed in smoke-filled rooms in the six counties, but it is anybody's guess as to when, or whether, it will prevail. No one pretends that a referendum now would produce any result other than a defeat for the concept of a united Ireland. This position may change as the Catholic proportion of the population increases. Unionists won 62 per cent of the votes in the elections to the Northern Ireland assembly in 1973. In last year's local elections their score was down to 49 per cent. The nationalist vote rose from a quarter to a third over the same period. Yet this is a slow process. The IRA/Sinn Fein is being asked to do a deal from which it cannot hope to profit for another generation. It will only acquiesce if it is convinced that there is no other way - that however much a section of the British public may long to be detached from Northern Ireland, it will not do so under duress, nor against the will of the people of the province. In London and Dublin this may seem like a statement of the obvious. There may be a long, bloody wait before it is accepted in Belfast. This does not mean that the Irish and British governments need do nothing. Once next month's elections to the European Parliament are out of the way, they should try once again to get the constitutional parties in the province to talk about a new settlement for governance of Ulster. The Boyle and Hadden book lists a variety of possibilities, some based on the ethnic separation that has evolved as Catholics and Protestants have moved to areas safer for themselves. The authors explore the power-sharing option, but their charts, particularly when set beside a Flemish-Walloon map of Belgium's provinces, speak for communal self-government. A 'preferendum' is proposed, based on the experience of Newfoundland in the 1940s. The options suggested for Ulster include continued direct rule, but not immediate unification with the south. There would be 'little point' in asking about that, say Boyle and Hadden. They propose that the Irish constitution and British law be altered, so that both promised to legislate for a united Ireland if at any time in the future a majority of the people of Ireland and Ulster voted in favour. It may seem fanciful to talk of preferendums and new internal arrangements for Ulster while the terrorist outrages continue. Unification, if it ever comes, is for well into the next century. But the two governments cannot wait forever for the IRA to make up its mind. As Mr Reynolds, quoting Edmund Burke, said at the weekend, 'there is a limit at which forbearance ceases to be virtue'. *Northern Ireland: the Choice, Penguin, Pounds 6.99</p>

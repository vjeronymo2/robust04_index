			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Martina Fietz: "CDU's Positive Mood Upsets SPD"] </F>   [Text] SPD [Social Democratic Party] Business Manager  Guenter Verheugen sees difficult times ahead for his party until  the Bundestag election. "But there is nothing new about that,"  he told DIE WELT yesterday. "I have never been in a state of  euphoria, and I kept saying that the middle of the year would be  a problematic time."    "The current situation is difficult because the coalition  parties might create the impression that everyone is in a  positive mood," Verheugen continued. "In addition the outcome  of the European elections is unforeseeable, just as the outcome  of the presidential elections was." At the same time, Verheugen  described the SPD situation as "stable." "The objective of the  forthcoming party congress in Halle must be to eradicate all  signs of a depressive mood."    In the meantime, the SPD is concerned about getting rid of  the impression that there might be differences of opinion on  central issues concerning election strategy. Verheugen  described rumors that he and party chief Scharping were at odds  with each other concerning a coalition statement as "pure  speculation." "The voters continue to determine the makeup of  coalitions," he said. Therefore, the Halle party congress cannot  adopt any specific statements apart from the one that the SPD  does not want a grand coalition. In answer to a question about  his remarks about the Greens being interpreted as a desire for  an alliance with that party, Verheugen said he had merely wanted  to express various options. "In this matter, I am in complete  agreement with Scharping," he said. The SPD chairman is  generally considered in favor of a socioliberal alliance.    In the meantime, voices can be heard within the SPD saying  that the Halle congress will insist on the SPD sharpening its  political countenance. "That need not necessarily lead to a  coalition statement, but an alternative to the present  government must be presented with greater determination than so  far. The accompanying difficulties are being seen with  increasing clarity. Last but not least, it remains to be seen  in what way reforms, such as the environmental reforms  concerning industry, can be financed," said Verheugen.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Dispatch from Beijing by trainee reporter Yang Fan (2799 </F> 1581): "Director of the Finance Research Institute Under the  People's Bank of China Says That the Central Government Has Been  Ready for Dealing With the Possibility of Exchange Rate  Fluctuations"]    [Text] Beijing, 2 Jan (WEN WEI PO) -- Today, Qin Chijiang,  director of the Finance Research Institute of the People's Bank  of China, told this reporter: It is inevitable and courageous  to unify the exchange rates of renminbi on 1 January, and the  central government is ready for dealing with possible  fluctuations in the exchange rates.    Qin Chijiang said: Unification of the exchange rates is the  prerequisite for the establishment of a socialist market  economy, which is favorable to converging with the international  currency market and is very beneficial to our current economy.    1. In the past, when foreign enterprises invested in China,  converted their incomes in renminbi for foreign exchange, and  remitted the money to their own countries, they had to use the  swap rate rather than the official exchange rate. Foreign  businessmen regarded this practice as "discrimination." Now,  the exchange rates have been unified, this obstacle has been  removed, and it is beneficial to foreign investment in China.    2. It is beneficial for foreigners in other ways besides  trade transactions. When they come to China, they can exchange  their own currency for more renminbi according to the market  swap rate rather than the official rate. Of course, the  domestic situation is a direct contrast. Since the prices of  buying foreign currency are higher, there is a heavier burden.  3. For China's enterprises engaging in foreign trade, the  unification of the exchange rates has pros and cons, and they  have to sell their foreign currency earned to banks according to  the swap rate and buy foreign currency from banks according to  the swap rate, but the system has become more reasonable.    He said: Whether or not the time is ripe to unify the  exchange rates should be determined by whether or not renminbi  is a stable currency, whether or not there is a balance of  international payments, whether or not the central bank's  intervention capability is strong, and whether or not the  relationship between domestic demand and supply is governed by  the mechanism. Controversy over the question of whether or not  the time is ripe remains. Some people question that with the  emergence of trade deficits, a huge domestic demand, an  extremely high degree of fixed-asset investment, and  insufficient competitive power of domestic products, if large  fluctuations of the exchange rate will occur following the  unification of the exchange rates. But Qin Chijiang said: The  unification of exchange rates is a very courageous measure, and  as long as the government is mentally prepared and appropriately  utilizes policies and measures, there is no need to fear, even  if large fluctuations occur.  <H3>  Free Conversion of Renminbi in Trade Must Be Realized Before  Readmission to GATT </H3>   Responding the question of what measures the government  would  prepare, Qin Chijiang cited an example and said: The government  has reduced the tariff rates of certain imports and this helps  stabilize the exchange rate. When fluctuations occur in the  foreign exchange market, the central bank will interfere with  foreign exchange. If there is large domestic demand for foreign  exchange, the central bank can also take the measure of  tightening the supply of currency and putting less renminbi into  circulation, and, as a result, the prices of renminbi in  exchange for foreign exchange will naturally rise. As  unification of the exchange rates is the first step of free  conversion of renminbi, when will free conversion be realized?  Director Qin said: Free conversion of renminbi in trade must be  realized before we are readmitted to GATT, whereas free  conversion of renminbi in nontrade activities will depend on  improvement of domestic management standard and will take a  longer time, but it is not possible to realize free conversion  of capital because there is a great domestic demand for capital  and the outflow of domestic capital through free conversion is  not allowed.</p>

			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Bridon faces hefty revamp charge Bridon, the wire rope and engineering products manufacturer, yesterday announced a restructuring aimed at streamlining production and expanding sales overseas. The move, the culmination of a six-month strategic review at the Doncaster-based group, is expected to lead to exceptional provisions of up to Pounds 25m in the year to December 31. The likely charge - up sharply on restructuring costs of Pounds 1.2m at the interim stage - sent the shares tumbling 25p early yesterday, although they later rallied to close up 4p at 160p. Initial market fears were raised by warnings of redundancies, asset disposals and the possible closure of at least one of Bridon's 12 factories, which make products for the construction, mining and offshore exploration industries. Mr Ronald Petersen, chief executive, said: 'We will be streamlining the management structure and anticipate disposals of non-core businesses. There is also one factory in the system which is surplus to requirements.' The restructuring, prompted by difficult market conditions and increasingly competitive pricing by rivals, would also include write-offs of overvalued assets, he added. Nevertheless, the group said it expected to 'broadly break even' before exceptional costs in the second half. In the six months to June 30, the group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 700,000) on increased turnover of Pounds 112.6m (Pounds 107m). Mr Petersen, who joined the group last September from Insituform - the US pipe-lining business, said the review would create new opportunities for growth. 'Bridon has not made sufficient money over the past four years. It has remained cash positive only because of careful asset management and tight cost control.' The full recommendations of the review will be published on March 24, when a new management structure would be in place, he added. Codenamed Project 360, because of its panoramic perspective of the company, the review is likely to recommend increased emphasis on Bridon's 76 'sling shop' sites around the world, which convert wire rope into slings for cranes and construction gantries. Despite the size of the provision, Mr Petersen was confident that the restructuring costs would be met from cash flow resources and increased borrowing. Gearing is understood to be less than 15 per cent, and the group said its main lenders had responded positively to the plans.</p>

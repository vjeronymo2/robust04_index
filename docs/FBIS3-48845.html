The author of the article notes:    If the Kim Yong-sam group truly wanted national  reconciliation and unity and reunification, it, first of all,  must have reformed the anti-national, anti-reunification ruling  system set up by the successive military dictatorial "regimes"  in South Korea. By invoking the "National Security Law" the  successive rulers of South Korea barred travel and contact  between North and South, blocked national reconciliation and  unity and tied fast the patriotic pro-reunification democratic  figures in South Korea who hoped for reconciliation and unity  with the North and harshly persecuted them, incriminating their  slightest move.    It is preposterous to talk about reunification, while  leaving  intact in South Korea the confrontation system with legal and  institutional mechanisms which totally negate and block national  reconciliation, unity and reunification itself. Nevertheless,  the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, while advertising "reform", is  keeping the whole of the anti-communist confrontation system of  the successive military dictatorial "regimes."    Worse still the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is on the run day  in and day out to beat fellow countrymen on the back with the  help of outside forces, crying for "international cooperation  system" and "sanctions" over the "nuclear problem".    The anti-national acts of the traitorous Kim Yong-sam clique  strip bare the anti-national color of the "civilian government"  pursuing North-South confrontation.    As long as the treacherous North-South confrontation system  against national reconciliation and unity is kept in South Korea  and such a separatist as the traitor Kim Yong-sam is left alone,  it is only too clear that one grave obstacle after another will  be laid in the way of the struggle for a great unity of our  nation and national reunification.    The situation gives a serious lesson that the South Korean  people and democratic forces must not place hope on the  "civilian government" but smash the anti-reunification moves of  the Kim Yong-sam traitor clique with a massive struggle.</p>

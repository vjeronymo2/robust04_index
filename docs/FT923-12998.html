			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / UK 'still attracts most EC inward investment' BRITAIN continues to attract the lion's share of inward investment into the European Community, in spite of a fall in the number of new projects because of the continuing international recession. Figures released yesterday by the Invest in Britain Bureau show that overseas companies are still investing more in the UK than in any other EC country. With the approaching single market, it is thought that the UK could be accounting for around a third of all incoming EC investment. According to the bureau, part of the Department of Trade and Industry, overseas companies endorsed 332 investment projects in the UK during the 12 months to the end of March 1992. There were 350 in the previous year. US and Japanese companies are channelling nearly 40 per cent of EC direct investment into the UK. Germany and France are also investing heavily in the UK. Mr Malcolm Day, director of the bureau, said the single market remained the driving force behind the inflow of investment, which was holding up well. Mr Day said a fall from the peak number of investments recorded in 1990-91 was understandable, given the state of the world economy and the fact that many of the largest international companies were already established in Britain. Current inquiries from overseas were showing another increase, he added. Britain's promotional efforts to attract a continuing flow of corporate investment would have to be maintained, he said. Particular emphasis will be placed on medium to smaller-sized businesses, and Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and Hong Kong will be targeted in the next 18 months. Over the last three years inward investors have bought, on average, more than half of all their capital equipment within the UK. The DTI says that companies establishing themselves are moving rapidly to increase local sourcing and to build long-term relationships with suppliers. About half the proposed new investment in the UK is by foreign companies that are already established in the UK. Japanese companies are extending their investment beyond manufacturing to include research and development facilities. Many of the incoming companies are, according to the DTI, spending more on training than their British competitors. The investment projects given the go-ahead in the year to March are expected to create nearly 23,000 new jobs and to safeguard nearly 29,000 more. Wales was particularly successful in securing new investment - attracting 71 projects - although Scotland and Northern Ireland were also chosen by a significant number of companies as suitable investment locations. The bureau provides no estimate of the value of recorded inward investment. Among the largest projects in 1991-92, however, was a decision by Sony, the electronics group, to invest Pounds 144m in expanding in Wales, and Kimberly Clark, the US consumer products company, to spend Pounds 100m in south Humberside.</p>

			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Realignment weakens D-Mark THE REALIGNMENT of the European Monetary System weakened the D-Mark against most currencies yesterday, but the market remained uncertain about the immediate future for exchange rates, writes James Blitz. The devaluation of the Italian lira and the cut in the Bundesbank's interest rates were intended to convince dealers that the EMS is a fixed system that will not disappear, whatever the outcome of this weekend's referendum in France on the Maastricht treaty. The Bundesbank showed that it was prepared to bow to international pressure to lower interest rates if that would help a realignment of the ERM. Mr Jim O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Bank Corp in London, said: 'Although the rate cuts were small, the principle of bowing to int-ernational pressure was significant. What we saw yesterday may even be the birth of the new European Central Bank.' Three factors could still upset the EMS structure in the short term. The first is Sunday's referendum, the shadow of which is now fully over the market. Sterling's performance against the D-Mark yesterday reflected the uncertainty, with the currency peaking at DM2.8250 overnight, but closing in London at DM2.8125, up more than 2 pfennigs from Friday's close. If the French vote No, the pressure on sterling will be intense on Monday morning, and a rise in UK base rates may be unavoidable. The second pressure will come if the Germans do not reduce interest rates again. The best interpretation of the Bundesbank's move yesterday was that rates had peaked. Probably the worst came from Mr Norbert Walter, chief economist at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt, who said there will not be another rate cut before mid-1993. Countries seeking interest rate reductions, such as the UK, Spain and Portugal, may question the validity of a German-led system again. The third pressure would come if the US dollar weakens again, forcing a new flight into D-Marks. The dollar peaked at DM1.5155 overnight and ended in London at DM1.4855, up 3 1/2 pfennigs from Friday's London close. In New York it closed mildly below the London finish at DM1.4821. The narrower interest rate differential between the US and Germany caused Mr Julian Simmonds, head of foreign exchange at Citibank, to declare that the dollar's fall has bottomed out. But the US economy remains fundamentally weak and, in the run-up to the US election, there could be pressure on the currency again. The one European currency that was actively bought was the lira. But it closed in London at L793 per D-Mark, having opened at L784.62, raising fears that the devaluation had been too small.</p>

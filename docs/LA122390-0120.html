			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> TSARNAS HOT IN COLD WEATHER TO HELP ANAHEIM WIN IN SOCCER  </P> <P> Even Saturday night's chilly temperatures failed to slow Anaheim High School  senior Mike Tsarnas, who scored twice in the Colonist soccer team's 2-0 victory  over top-ranked Orange.  </P> <P> The victory gave Anaheim (10-0-1), the fifth-ranked team in Orange County, the  championship of the Orange tournament at Chapman College.  </P> <P> The Panthers are 7-1-3.  </P> <P> Tsarnas, who is being recruited by UCLA, kicked his 20th and 21st goals of the  season five minutes into each half. His second goal was from 30 yards out.  </P> <P> Orange's defense, led by goalkeeper Eric Jaime, had shut out nine opponents  this season but was unable to contain Tsarnas, who scored 24 goals last season.  </P> <P> "I was surprised it went in from so far out," Tsarnas said. "I didn't kick it  that hard and the wind slowed it down a little but it curved the ball a little  and faked out their goalie."  </P> <P> After Tsarnas' first goal, Anaheim's defense denied Orange any clear shots  until Juan Viveros' shot was stopped by goalkeeper Jose Torres with four  minutes remaining in the half.  </P> <P> Orange sweeper Justin Zayas' apparent goal with 12 minutes remaining in the  second half was disallowed when he was called for pushing the goalkeeper.  </P> <P> "We were fired up, but we made too many mistakes," Orange Coach Ed Carrillo  said. "That second goal should have never been made. TOM BIRSCHBACH  </P></p>

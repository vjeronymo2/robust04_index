			<p>Debt        Crisis Temporarily Halts State Broadcasting                               S U M M A RY      Protesting state-owned television and radio companies' prolonged  failure to pay for broadcasting services, Ministry of  Communications workers struck on 10 February, disrupting  broadcasts across much of Russia.  Although Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin persuaded the broadcasters to end their strike the  same day by promising to pay the debt, he hinted that the  government may turn to privatization of some television and radio  companies to reduce the debt problem.  The belated government  response to the strike threat suggests that new state television  chief Aleksandr Yakovlev, who is not a member of the cabinet, may  not be well positioned in the government to serve as an effective  spokesman for his sector.                                 END SUMMARY      Ministry of Communications workers launched their strike on 10  February complaining that they had not been paid in months, and  that state television and radio companies owed them 80 billion  rubles.  During the strike the workers refused to broadcast state  programming except news.  According to various reports, the  strike curtailed broadcasting in 30 to 60 regions including St.  Petersburg but not Moscow (Interfax, 10 February; Nezavisimaya  Gazeta, 12 February).      Efforts by the government to avert the strike appear to have been  too little, too late.  According to Anatoliy Nazeykin, chairman  of the Central Committee of the Russian Federation Trade Union of  Communications Workers, on 21 January a conference of  communications industry representatives sent to the government a  package of proposals on resolving the situation along with a  demand that the government pay the debt by I February, but the  government did not reply (Segodnya, 10 February; Rossiyskaya  Gazeta, 25 January).  The government began to react after Russian  Television reported on 8 February that the central committee of  the Union of Communications Workers had threatened to strike on  10 February if the debts were not paid.  On 9 February  Chernomyrdin convened an "emergency" meeting with Communications  Minister Vladimir Bulgak, whom he reportedly had to call away  from a medical examination, Aleksandr Yakovlev, Chairman of the  Russian Federal Service for Television and Radio Broadcasting,  and Communications Ministry officials, but without  representatives of the communications workers trade union (Trud,  10 February).  After the meeting Chernomyrdin ordered the Finance  Ministry to "explore the possibilities" for a gradual repayment  of the debt (Segodnya, 10 February) and "appealed" to  communications workers to continue broadcasting (Radio Rossii, 10  February).      Communications workers rejected Chernomyrdin's response to their  demands and went ahead with their strike as threatened.  Nazeykin  called Chernomyrdin's response "vague and indefinite" and  dismissed his instructions to the Finance Ministry as  unconvincing--" instructions are not the same as money" (Segodnya,  10 February; Interfax, 10 February).   Nazeykin said that the  government had issued more than 10 such instructions in 1993 but  the problem remained unsolved and had become "extremely  exacerbated" (ITAR-TASS, 10 February).      The seriousness of the television debt situation first became  apparent in June of 1993 when broadcasters threatened blackouts  to draw attention to their plight.  At that time the Finance  Ministry, under pressure from Russian Television and its radio  affiliate Radio Rossii, averted widespread blackouts, (though  regional blackouts did occur), by agreeing to pay one quarter of  an 8 billion ruble debt.  The situation continued to deteriorate,  however, as the television companies fell further and further in  arrears to communications companies, and the latters' debts to  their energy suppliers steadily grew.      Strike Settled, Problem Remains      Making more promises to pay off the debt, Chernomyrdin persuaded  the communications workers to end their strike quickly, but he  hinted that the government may resort to privatizing some  television channels to relieve the debt problem.  Nezavisimaya  Gazeta (12 February) reported that Chernomyrdin had made a "firm  promise" to pay off the debt by the end of the first fiscal  quarter of 1994 and asked the communications workers to resume  normal broadcasting.  By the evening of 10 February they did, and  the strike ended.  Nezavisimaya Gazeta television affairs  commentator Irina Petrovskaya pointed out the temporary nature of  the solution warning that "everyone understands:  the situation  may be repeated."  Commenting on the strike's end, Chernomyrdin  suggested that the government may ultimately try to deal with the  debt problem by privatizing some state-owned channels:  "one  should look to see what needs to be corporatized and what should  be privatized" (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 12 February).      Implications      The communication workers' demand for payment is only one of a  number of large claims being pressed on the government now that  the most influential monetarists, who were the staunchest  opponents of such budget busting demands, have left the cabinet.  Indeed, the workers may have been emboldened to escalate pressure  to meet their demands by the monetarists' exit and the  agricultural lobby's recent success in grabbing a chunk of the  budget.  It is noteworthy that Chernomyrdin, seemingly pressed by  claimants on all sides, hinted at privatization rather than  administrative measures, to relieve the broadcasters' debt  crisis.

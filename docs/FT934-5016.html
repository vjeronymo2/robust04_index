			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Inheritance tax threshold held at Pounds 150,000  -Exchequer to reap extra Pounds 10m in 1994-95 The inheritance tax threshold is to stay at Pounds 150,000 for 1994-95, the Inland Revenue said yesterday. The ceiling had been due to rise by an index-linked 1.8 per cent to Pounds 153,000. The extra yield to the Exchequer will be Pounds 10m in 1994-95, Pounds 20m in 1995-96 and Pounds 25m in 1996-97 compared to indexation. Since inheritance tax was introduced in 1986 the threshold has risen by more than twice the increase in the retail prices index. The number of estates paying inheritance tax on deaths in 1993-94 is estimated at 19,000, less than 3 per cent of the total deaths in that year, the Inland Revenue said. 'Leaving the threshold unchanged means that there will be about 21,000 tax-paying estates for deaths in 1994-95. The estimated yield for inheritance tax in 1994-95 is Pounds 1.4bn.' The annual exempt amount for capital gains tax is to be held at Pounds 5,800 for 1994-95. An individual whose total net gains in a tax year do not exceed the annual exempt amount is not liable to capital gains tax. Husbands and wives are each entitled to their own separate exemption. The total exempt amount available to a married couple will remain at Pounds 11,600 for 1994-95. An exemption of Pounds 5,800 is also available to the trustees of a trust for a mentally handicapped person or for a person receiving attendance allowance or the middle or higher rate of disability living allowance. For trustees of other settlements the exempt amount is Pounds 2,900. An exemption of Pounds 5,800 is also available to personal representatives for gains accruing to them in the year of death and the two following years of assessment. The exemptions are automatically increased each year in line with the retail prices index unless Parliament determines otherwise. Statutory indexation will not apply for 1994-95. The measures will increase the yield from capital gains tax by about Pounds 5m a year from 1995-96.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by staff reporter Fang Yuen (2455 0337): </F> "Li Peng Report at Upcoming National People's Congress To Take  Reform, Stability As the Main Theme"]    [Text] According to a source in Beijing, the 20-character  principle of "seizing the opportunity, promoting development,  and deepening reform, opening up wider, and maintaining  stability" will be the main theme of the Eighth National  People's Congress [NPC], which opens on 10 March. Li Peng's  Government Work Report will be focused on the relationship  between reform, development, and stability.    It has been reported that the "Securities Law (Draft),"  which  was set to be one of the main points on the agenda of the  current congress, will not be submitted to the congress for  deliberation. Instead, the "Budget Law" and "Law for Protecting  Taiwan Investment" will be submitted to the congress for  deliberation and approval.    Premier Li Peng's Government Work Report (Solicitation of  Opinions), drafted by the State Council's writing group, has  been distributed to the ministries, committees, and provincial  groups.    It is said that this year's government report will comprise  around 17,000 characters, more or less the same as last year.  It will consist of seven parts:    First, a review and summary of last year's work.    Second, the tasks laid down for this year's economic  development.    Third, reform.    Fourth, strengthening macroeconomic control and regulation  and checking inflation.    Fifth, spiritual civilization, education, and social order.    Sixth, Taiwan and Hong Kong.    Seventh, the international situation and diplomatic work.    Reportedly, the 20-character principle will run through Li  Peng's Government Work Report. Li Peng will also talk at length  about the relationship between reform, development, and  stability. An authoritative person said that the original theme  of "reform" may eventually be changed to "stability."    Many local officials have complained about the setbacks  encountered in implementing a series of reform measures  introduced this year. It is estimated that many of the CPC  Central Committee's policies will be censured at this year's  congress. For this reason, the central authorities made  preparations long ago. On the one hand, senior officials were  sent to all localities before the Lunar New Year to do  persuasive work. On the other hand, the media's reportage of  the congress will be kept under strict control and "stability"  will be the top priority.    The dates for this year's NPC and Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference [CPPCC] have been brought forward. It  is said that the authorities intend to bring the dates of the  two annual sessions forward, to be held annually after the Lunar  New Year to make plans for the new year. The authorities hold  that post-Lunar New Year is the appropriate time for holding the  sessions. If the dates are brought forward it will be difficult  to draft the Government Work Report and prepare the statistics.    Accommodation for NPC delegates is more or less the same as  in previous years. The only difference is that more delegates  will stay in official and Army guest houses rather than the  Xiyuan Hotel and other starred hotels as in the past. Beijing  Hotel will "exclusively" receive the Guangdong delegation this  year. The Shanghai delegation, the most conspicuous one, will  stay in the Army's heavily guarded Jingxi Guesthouse.</p>

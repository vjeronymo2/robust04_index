			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nikolaos Khasapopoulos] </F>   [Text] President Bill Clinton will propose North Macedonia  as the name for Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia--FYROM] at his White House meeting on Friday [22  April] with Greek Premier Andreas Papandreou.    Diplomatic sources in Athens revealed that the U.S.  ambassador to Greece, Thomas Niles, had personally vetted North  Macedonia as the best name for Skopje in a confidential cable to  the State Department, shortly before Mr Papandreou's departure  for Washington on Monday. The premier arrived last night in  Washington.    Mr Niles confided to a group of Greek diplomats he had  invited for dinner at his home. He said he thought the question  of the Skopje flag and any usurpation of Greek symbols were  capable of quick resolution once the name issue had been agreed.  The ambassador conveyed his optimism that the Greek premier's  visit to the White House would be "productive."    "If you manage to wrap up the Skopje issue, Greece can then  become the major power in the Balkans" and dominate the region  economically, the U.S. envoy was quoted as telling his Greek  guests.    When Mr Niles was asked by his guests whether Skopje  President Kiro Gligorov would agree to a North Macedonia deal,  their host replied that "this name has already been tabled" at  the meetings which UN mediator Cyrus Vance has held in New York  with Skopje's Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski and the Greek  envoy Khristos Zakharakis.    Mr Niles is also said to have revealed U.S. initiatives on  armed flights over the Aegean by both Turkey and Greece,  pressuring each side to stop the flights which provoke tension  in Greek-Turkish relations.</p>

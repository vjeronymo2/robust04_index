			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Agency attacks funding of courses A SHARP attack on government funding of training was made last night by the Business and Technician Education Council (BTEC), the largest validating body of vocational courses in England and Wales. Mr John Sellars, BTEC chairman, told the Commons employment committee that the Department of Employment had refused to fund BTEC courses through the Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs). He said: 'This is effectively blocking many young people from taking their first step on the training ladder, and not meeting demand for training.' To attract Department of Employment funding through the Tecs, courses must be approved by the department's Training, Enterprise and Education division. 'At present', Mr Sellars told MPs, 'BTEC programmes are not on this list, and some training organisations who prefer to offer our qualifications are unable to do so, particularly at first level.' BTEC first level is equivalent to five GCSE passes. Mr Sellars also called on the government to draw up a national strategy to extend vocational training into the workplace. 'We believe that a vocational education and training dimension must not only be introduced into the formal education system, but also extended into the employment environment', he said. 'In-creased recognition of the value of these qualifications to individuals and the economy must start from the top, ie government'. About half a million students are studying BTEC programmes. Registrations have risen by 40 per cent since 1985.</p>

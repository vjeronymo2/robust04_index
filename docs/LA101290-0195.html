			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> PAVAROTTI NOTES SURROUNDINGS  </P> <P> In the world designed by Italian opera star Luciano Pavarotti, there are no  smoky rooms or steps to climb off stage. The decor is in jewel tones and there  is a king-size bed, a large television screen, a videocassette recorder and  Italian movie tapes.  </P> <P> Those are among the particulars the famously particular tenor made with his  reservations at the Blakely Hotel, where he will stay while here for a  performance Sunday.  </P> <P> That's not all his musical heart desires. Pavarotti also wants humidifiers in  his room to keep his voice clear, large chairs with footstools in his dressing  room and an electric golf cart to take him from the plane to the limousine and  his dressing room.  </P> <P> Pavarotti chose the Blakely from photographs his secretary made last summer.  </P></p>

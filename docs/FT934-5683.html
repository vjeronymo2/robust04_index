			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Management: Nothing succeeds like succession - Tips From The Top / Sir David Plastow, chairman of Inchcape, offers advice on how to plan for board succession For anyone fascinated with the way that apparently well-run and successful companies can suddenly come to grief without warning, the past few years have been a time of above-average interest. Several large organisations have hit trouble in spectacular fashion. Some collapsed altogether while others survived, but with their corporate reputations dented. Global recession, personal greed, over-inflated egos, the lust for power and plain incompetence at a senior level have all contributed. But another cause has been the lack of effective boardroom succession planning. Some otherwise excellent board directors concentrate so hard on achieving their business goals that they are blind to the problems they can face if the balance of their board is upset. What happens when the chairman slips under the proverbial red bus, or when several board members who should already have retired decide simultaneously that struggling each month to the boardroom for meetings is getting too much for them? Either way, the board can unexpectedly find its composition changed beyond recognition. Gaps may appear in the board's spread of competences. Shareholders may be unsettled. But these problems can be avoided. What is needed is a clear set of rules and commitment from the directors that they will follow them. The key is fixed retirement ages. Different age limits may suit different companies but 60 for executive directors and 65 for non-executives has worked well for the boards on which I have served. Equally important is the need to maintain a balance of ages. If retirement is compulsory at 65 and the directors are in their early 60s there are problems ahead. The succession policy should also make it clear that non-executives are appointed for fixed terms, with no automatic reappointment. Directorships should be neither jobs for the boys nor jobs for life. The ideal term is an initial three years, with another three-year period if all is going well, followed by annual reviews. Whatever standard appointment periods are agreed, it is important that they are there for all to see. This does away with uncertainty and the embarrassment caused when directors have to tell a colleague the time has come to step down. Inevitably there will still be cases where a director will say: 'Joe has never been fitter, and he is as bright as a button. How can we possibly let him go just because he is 65?' This attitude must be met head-on by the board. Unless they resist the temptation to make exceptions the benefits of a carefully structured succession policy are lost. And when directors do leave, how should their replacements be recruited? During their careers company directors build up an impressive network of contacts. Some directors think that because they have this network they know best when it comes to choosing candidates to join the board. Unfortunately they are usually wrong. That is why it is essential for a headhunter to be called in. This ensures that the widest possible range of candidates is considered and reduces the likelihood that directors will, possibly for the wrong reasons, nominate one of their cronies. It is equally important that the nominations committee should have the support of the whole board in the final selection. The ultimate responsibility for all this lies with the chairman who, taking a look in the corporate mirror, should have an agreed period in office and also provide for his or her own eventual replacement. As an extension of this, one of the first things I did in my present role was to ask our senior non-executive director to take responsibility for organising my replacement if that ever became necessary, for whatever reason. Directors who fail to recognise the need for effective succession planning at board level are storing up trouble for the future. Some may get away with it but there is a real risk, as we have seen, that it will all end in tears. Next Monday: James Hann of Scottish Nuclear on managing time.</p>

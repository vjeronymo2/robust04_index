			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. P. Kim, V. V. Khegay and P. V. </F> Illich-Svitych, Institute of Terrestrial Magnetism, Ionosphere  and Radio Wave Propagation, Russian Academy of Sciences; UDC  550.510.535]    [Abstract] Computations were made of the penetration of an  electrostatic field of seismic origin into the ionosphere for  the case of a Gaussian distribution of the vertical electric  field E[.sub]z[/] at the Earth's surface in the epicentral  region of an impending earthquake. It was found that the  effectiveness of field penetration at nighttime is far greater  than during the daytime and is highly dependent on the extent of  the region of localization of the vertical E[.sub]z[/] field.  The strength of the electrostatic field at ionospheric altitudes  has an appreciable value  0.3-0.7 mV/m only for large-scale  seismic sources (a  100 km) under the condition that  |E[.sub]z[/]| at the epicenter is  1000 V/m. A study of  the effect of the electric field of a seismic source on the  background ionosphere also was made. The greatest effect is  observed in the middle part of the nighttime E layer where the  Pedersen drift of ions is maximum. The nature of the ionospheric  disturbance is determined by the direction of E[.sub]z[/].  With positive E[.sub]z[/] the electron concentration  experiences an appreciable decrease over the region of  localization of E[.sub]z[/] and when the E[.sub]z[/] field  is directed downward there is an increase in N[.sub]e[/]. The  degree of ionospheric disturbance is determined by the  |E[.sub]z[/]| value at the epicenter and the extent of  localization of the E[.sub]z[/] region.

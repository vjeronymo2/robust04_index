			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAVAGE HOLDS SLIM LEAD IN ILLINOIS VOTE  </P> <P> Rep. Gus Savage was leading a Democratic challenger in his fight to keep his  job after allegations of sexual misconduct, and Secretary of State Jim Edgar, a  pro-choice moderate, defeated an anti-abortion conservative Tuesday to claim  the Republican nomination for Illinois governor.  </P> <P> In the 2nd Congressional District, with nearly 85% of the precincts reporting,  Savage had 51% of the vote to 44% for newcomer Mel Reynolds.  </P> <P> Ernest Washington, a follower of political extremist Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr.,  had a small percentage. The district represents parts of Chicago's heavily  Democratic South Side and some suburbs, and the winner of the primary will be  strongly favored in November.  </P> <P> In another race, attorney Richard Phelan, whose ethics investigation prompted  the resignation of House Speaker Jim Wright, won a four-way Democratic primary  for the powerful Cook County Board presidency.  </P></p>

			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / International Company News: Austrian steelmaker seals mill deal AUSTRIA's Voest-Alpine Steel, bidding to become the dominant steelmaker in east-central Europe, yesterday sealed its investment in Hungary's largest cold-rolling mill. Voest-Alpine, a subsidiary of Austrian Industries, the state industrial holding company, is paying Ft2.4bn (Dollars 31m) for half-ownership and management control of the Dunaujvaros plant in central Hungary. The Austrian steel company's eastern expansion is made more urgent by increasing concentration in the European industry. By adding eastern markets, Voest-Alpine can attain the size to survive alone, according to Mr Wolfgang Eder, the general secretary. The stake in Dunaujvaros is seen as establishing access to the Hungarian market. The venture hopes to win new custom from the Hungarian operations of multi-nationals, like Suzuki's car plant and Electrolux's refrigerator factory. Nevertheless, overall local demand for steel has fallen sharply and competition from Czechoslovak producers has grown fierce. Although the Dunaujvaros venture will continue to produce mainly for the Hungarian market, Voest-Alpine is exploring an international division of labour - basic manufacturing in the east and special steel production in the west. The Dunaujvaros plant, which has an annual capacity of 500,000 tonnes, was chosen because it is linked to Linz by the Danube.</p>

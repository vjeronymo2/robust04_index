			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Free speech for Europe THE EUROPEAN Commission will soon decide whether to abolish the telephone monopolies which exist in most member states. Its decision will not only be a watershed for telecommunications but will also define its overall attitude to public monopolies. The decision will be controversial as the public consultation now at an end has shown. Ranged against full-blooded liberalisation are most of the monopolies themselves, backed by their national ministries. In favour are users and a few telephone companies, the most important being British Telecommunications, which published a powerful document on the subject this week. It is uncertain which way the Commission will go. This is partly because the two commissioners with the biggest say - Mr Karel van Miert, in charge of competition, and Mr Martin Bangemann, in charge of industry - are both new to the sector. But the Commission should have no doubt over what to do. Not only is the economic case for full liberalisation of both services and infrastructure overwhelming. The Commission is arguably required to open the market by the Treaty of Rome's competition provisions. Competition will bring lower prices and stimulate investment in new services. In particular, it will help tie Europe together by driving down cross-border tariffs which are three to six times higher than charges for calls of a similar distance in the US. Maintaining monopolies, by contrast, will undermine Europe's competitiveness at a time when the US and Japan have already moved down the path of liberalisation. The legal position is also clear. The European Court of Justice has reaffirmed that the treaty's competition provisions apply to public monopolies and that the Commission has the authority to implement them. In this case - as in others concerning competition - the principle of subsidiarity cannot be used to deter Commission action. If nations had local choice on whether to open up their markets, the single market would quickly fragment. The only possible justification for retaining the monopolies would be if that was the only way social obligations, such as the provision of universal service, could be preserved. But this much-used argument has been undermined by the fact that telecommunications has been successfully liberalised elsewhere without abandoning social obligations. It is, of course, important to ensure a level playing field so that new rivals do not simply 'cherry-pick', leaving the established players handicapped with obligations. But this is perfectly feasible - for example, through a system of access charges whereby competitors contribute to social costs. The Commission has already taken small steps down the path of liberalisation. It may now be tempted to take more half measures and phase them in over a long period. But Europe has already waited long enough and nothing less than full competition will do.</p>

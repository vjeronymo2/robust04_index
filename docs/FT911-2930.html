			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / International Company News: Bank of Boston displays early signs of turnround BANK OF BOSTON, hard-hit by the depressed New England economy, suffered another loss in the first quarter. But the bank is showing some early signs of a turnaround, including lower non-performing assets and loan write-offs, as well as a cut in overhead expenses. The first-quarter loss was Dollars 88.7m, or Dollars 1.24 a share, compared with earnings of Dollars 43.6m, or 55 cents a share, a year earlier. Net interest income tumbled to Dollars 202.4m from Dollars 302.3m, reflecting narrower margins and lower assets. However, margins did improve slightly compared with the final three months of 1990. Although fee-based income was little changed from last year, total non-interest earnings dropped to Dollars 155m from Dollars 212m. The 1990 figure included Dollars 33m from the settlement of pension obligations. Profits fell from mezzanine financing and venture capital. Non-interest expense rose to Dollars 345m from Dollars 326m, but would have fallen by 4 per cent were it not for costs on foreclosed real estate and the bank's failed bid for Bank of New England. BNE was sold earlier this week to a consortium led by Fleet/Norstar of Rhode Island. Bank of Boston, which will be displaced as the region's biggest bank by the enlarged Fleet/Norstar, said it spent Dollars 16m on its abortive bid for BNE. The bank's portfolio of commercial property, highly-leveraged transaction and Third World loans has dropped for the past five quarters. But these problem assets still comprised 32 per cent of the total portfolio on March 31, down from 41 per cent a year earlier. Non-accrual assets and foreclosed property fell to Dollars 1.8bn on March 31 from almost Dollars 2bn. Net credit losses of Dollars 100m were somewhat higher than a year earlier, but well below the Dollars 164m in the fourth quarter of 1990. Bank of Boston has trimmed its payroll by 11 per cent in the past year, including a loss of 800 jobs in the latest three months.</p>

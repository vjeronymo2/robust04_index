			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, May 2 (CTK) -- Danish Foreign Minister  Niels Petersen, who arrived for a visit today, told journalists  that he and Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec had discussed  the expansion of the European Union (EU). He said the Danish  Government considered it important that the EU remain an open  organization and that was why it intensively tried to arrive at  an agreement between the EU and Sweden, Norway, Finland and  Austria. Petersen said he hoped that these countries would  become EU members as of January 1, 1995, thus opening up a new  EU chapter of extending eastwards.    The Danish Government is determined to seek the EU's  extension to Central and East European states, including the  Czech Republic, and considers it very significant, Petersen  said. The government welcomes the Czechs' effort at joining  this organization, he added.    Zieleniec said he and Petersen devoted much time to an  analysis of the situation in Europe, to security issues and  prospects of the United States-proposed Partnership for Peace  program for European security. The Czech side is prepared to  make use of the project for cooperation between the two  countries' Armies and Defense Ministries. He said it was also  important that small states mutually cooperate in the security  sphere.    Petersen labelled the two countries' relations as excellent.  Both ministers also pointed to increasing mutual trade and  Denmark's active role in bilateral trade and economic relations.  Also discussed was a potential visit to the Czech Republic by  the Queen of Denmark. Tomorrow, Petersen will leave for  Slovakia.</p>

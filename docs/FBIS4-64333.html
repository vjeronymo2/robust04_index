			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Government statement on signing the GATT agreement in </F> Marrakesh, delivered by Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt at  the Bundestag session in Bonn on 22 April]    [Text] Madame President, Ladies and Gentlemen:    On 15 April the Uruguay Round was concluded successfully. In  Marrakesh 124 negotiating partners gave their assent to the  final act. This is a milestone in trade policy. With a new  framework for world trade, important conditions for promoting  investments and for creating jobs have been set down.    The Marrakesh agreement is of outstanding importance for  Germany. The export-oriented German economy -- one out of three  jobs in Germany depends on exports -- will benefit from the  progress made in liberalization. GATT no longer is just an  empty term. The Marrakesh agreements are important for all  people, also in our country.    All those who believed that they could hide behind the walls  of protectionism or could avoid structural changes have been  wrong. The strong approval for GATT and the newly founded World  Trade Organization (WTO) clearly shows: The countries in this  world want free trade, and they want to face up to the  structural change, because they know this is the only way to  ensure growth, employment, and prosperity in the long run.    The festive signing was preceded by a negotiation marathon  that lasted seven years, a marathon with many difficulties and  obstacles. In the course of these seven years profound political  and economic changes took place. In addition, there were  disparities and controversies among the partners to the  negotiations. Often it was difficult to overcome these things.    Because of our elementary interest in the liberalization of  world trade, during the entire period of negotiations the  Federal Government worked emphatically, also in Brussels, for  steps of liberalization that are as far-reaching as possible.  In this connection, it was necessary to balance the differing  interests within the European Community, if possible without  losing too much of the substance with regard to the planned  liberalization.    In particular in the final stage of the negotiations in  December 1993, the Federal Government made an essential  contribution to facilitating the conclusion of the Uruguay  Round. We were successful in bridging opposing views, in  particular toward our French partners.    In view of the difficult course of the negotiations, I am  extremely satisfied that we have managed to achieve an agreement  of this quality.    First, we have achieved far-reaching progress in  liberalization in many fields. Thus, customs duties are reduced  by more than one-third on average for access of industrial goods  to the market. The average customs rate for industrial goods is  now no longer 6.3 percent but only 3.9 percent.    Second, the agreement on trade in services, which exists in  this field for the first time, is an outstanding success. It  brings internationally valid obligations for granting  most-favored-nation status, market access, and national  treatment.    Germany, the world's fourth largest exporter of services,  will benefit from this agreement in a special way. Services  constitute about one-quarter of all German exports.    Even more important is their contribution to employment. Of  the 7 million people employed in German export business, about  one-third are working in the service sector. The new  multilateral framework will enable the service sector to make  further progress because of its positive effects on growth and  employment.    Third -- and this was urgently necessary -- we have achieved  better protection of intellectual property. The agreement  expands legal protection and, for the first time, links it with  regulations to enforce these rights.    Fourth, for textile and clothing trade we have achieved that  this sector is reintegrated gradually in the GATT agreements, in  the GATT rules in the course of a few years. This is in the  interest of both the industrial countries and the developing  countries.    Fifth, for the agricultural sector we have achieved that  agricultural production and agricultural trade will be  integrated more strongly in the GATT and brought closer to the  GATT. This also establishes the preconditions for greater  market orientation of this sector.    Last, but not least: The newly founded WTO will contribute  to strengthening the multilateral trade system. GATT will be  replaced, and this new WTO will replace it. It will contribute  to the permanent progress and implementation in this  organization of the process of trade alleviations, customs  reductions, improvements in services, which has been concluded  with the Uruguay Round for the time being.    Even more important is: With this WTO we will for the first  time create a functioning instrument of arbitration. Then world  trade will work less along the lines of "an eye for an eye, a  tooth for a tooth." If one has to accept real or supposed trade  problems and measures by another country, one simply does not  react with retaliation. Rather, things are to be settled if  possible in this international institution for arbitration.  This is a very great progress; this is a breakthrough in world  trade.    Here I have to note that I suggested to bring the WTO to  Bonn. This is an idea which we have to discuss, which we have to  prepare. The question of the seat is still open. Other states,  such as Sweden, Canada, and, of course, Switzerland, where the  GATT Secretariat has its seat now, are also trying to get the  WTO. However, I think that Bonn, a city in the heart of Europe  with an excellent infrastructure, would be a serious applicant,  a good applicant. My ministry is preparing the application.    I do not hide the fact that the Uruguay Round has not  solved all problems. Additional negotiations are necessary,  primarily for the service sector and here in particular  regarding financial services, but also in ocean traffic. The  audiovisual sector has not been finally settled. We will have  to discuss a multilateral agreement about civilian planes and  also a multilateral settlement for steel. All this is  confronting us, but it cannot diminish the value of GATT and  Marrakesh.    Let me say a few brief words on the ongoing so-called banana  war. In Marrakesh we achieved the protection of our German legal  position within the European Community. The lawsuit at the  European Court of Justice has not been prejudiced, it continues.  Shortly before the signing of the agreement in Marrakesh, one  of our most important partners signed an agreement about  government purchases, thus establishing complicated  interlacements of our banana market regulation. We were able to  defend ourselves against that. It was not easy, but we managed.  In any case, this was a fact with which we enforced our views  clearly and unambiguously on the basis of a correct position.    Ladies and Gentlemen, Sir Leon Brittan, who headed the  negotiations for the European Union, spoke of a new trade policy  vision in connection with the GATT agreement. Now it is  necessary to fill this trade policy vision with life. Only then  will it develop its specific use.    Even though it is difficult to give an exact figure for the  expected economic profit, this has been tried several times --  with impressive results. The OECD puts the increase in  prosperity for the international economy at about $270 billion  in 2002 after the implementation of the liberalization  agreement. Furthermore, the GATT Secretariat expects world  trade to be about $755 billion higher in 10 years as a result of  the Uruguay Round than if the status quo were continued.    I repeat, Ladies and Gentlemen: The results of the Uruguay  Round will benefit all participants in the developing countries  and in the developed world. I say this with a particular view  to our partners in the developing countries: Safeguarding the  interests of the developing countries remains one of the central  negotiation results.    In particular in the new WTO we will continue to pursue the  further deepening of the integration of the developing countries  in the multilateral trade system. In addition, in Marrakesh we  made a statement of commitment to the developing countries: We  will examine the effects of the Uruguay Round with a view to  supporting positive measures to achieve their development goals.    Ladies and Gentlemen, a great number of countries have  applied for membership in GATT or in the new WTO. This is  incontrovertible proof of the attractiveness of the multilateral  trade system. At the same time it is proof of the WTO's ability  to function. The Federal Government advocates making  open-minded and speedy progress with these negotiations for  membership. In particular the countries of the former East Bloc  must be given prospects for membership. Their membership will  essentially contribute to the success of the process of  structural reforms.    There are also many new complicated and controversial topics  that will shortly be on the agenda of trade policy bodies.  These include the tensions between trade and environment.  Trade and environmental policy are closely linked. Thus, many  products can hardly be produced or transported all over the  world without this having an effect on the environment.  Conversely, national environmental policy can influence  international trade; just think of different standards which  affect the costs of production in specific places. This is  considered by some to be a threat. They even speak of  environmental dumping.    And now the establishment of a committee in the WTO -- as  this was decided in Marrakesh -- will take the issue of globally  effective environmental protection a decisive step forward. We  have agreed on this and we see this body as a suitable  institution for discussing these important interrelations.    Just as full of tension and politically highly sensitive is  the other group of topics, namely labor and social standards.  Ladies and Gentlemen, no one can accept exploiting children's  labor, labor by prisoners, and forced labor. We must work with  determination for overcoming these unbearable conditions in the  world. For this purpose we need a consensus, we need  cooperation, and, if necessary, also political pressure.    However, Ladies and Gentlemen, we do not want to establish  any new barriers which would further exacerbate the cycle of  poverty, unemployment, and children's labor. We want a  multilateral discussion to which all participants make their  contributions. It is very important that this discussion takes  place in the appropriate bodies -- in the bodies of the United  Nations and the International Labor Organization, for instance.    This discussion will certainly also be held in the WTO.  However, it must not dominate or even paralyze the work of the  WTO.    And one thing must be clear: Neither environmental  protection nor labor and social standards must be turned into  vehicles for trade restrictions. Some people are just waiting  to revive protectionism in the world with this vehicle. We would  all suffer from that and in particular those would suffer who  want to improve the world's environmental and social standards.    A third important topic affects the relationship between  trade and competition policy. Cross-border investments as well  as global activities by multinational companies often avoid the  control of usual regulations for competition, even though they  often distort competition or restrict trade.    We can observe that political pressure is growing to react  to  these distortions with trade policy measures. Such a  development could counteract and devalue the new GATT agreements  and concessions. Therefore, the whether and how of an  international competitive order should be discussed soon.    The temptation to give oneself onesided advantages and to  protect oneself against competition through protectionism will  exist also in the future. Our signature under the Uruguay  agreement and the adoption of the statement of Marrakesh commit  us to not giving in to this temptation.    Ladies and Gentlemen, in the future as in the past I  consider  it my priority task as German economics minister to oppose  protectionism wherever it appears.    In our economic policy the strengthening of the German  competitive position on the world's market, in particular on the  booming markets in Asia, for instance, but also in Latin  America, is of particular importance. GATT will that make  easier for us. GATT is a contribution to overcoming the  recession and also to solving the structural problems. GATT  will contribute to giving Germany new opportunities for  employment.</p>

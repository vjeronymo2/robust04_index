			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ASK THE JUDGE: FINDERS CAN BE KEEPERS -- A FEW STEPS LATER  </P> <P> Q My son found a ring in the park. We haven't had a jeweler look at it yet, but  it appears to be valuable. Can we keep it?  </P> <P> J.E.,  </P> <P> Tustin  </P> <P> A You obviously have a responsibility to return the ring to its owner if you  know their identity. If you don't, and the value of the ring is $10 or more,  you must turn it over to the police. If the ring is valued at $50 or more, and  if the owner does not claim it within 90 days, the police must publish notice  in a newspaper that it has been found. If the owner does not claim it within 7  more days, you can have the ring if you pay the cost of publishing the notice.  If the ring is worth less than $50, you may have the ring after 90 days without  the published notice.  </P> <P> Q I have undergone a sex operation and had my name legally changed. I would  like to change my birth certificate as well. How do I do this?  </P> <P> T.W.,  </P> <P> Garden Grove  </P> <P> A If you have had surgery to alter your sex, you may obtain a new birth  certificate to reflect the change and your new name. An application must be  filed with the superior court of the county in which you live.  </P> <P> Q I agreed to sell my neighbor a car. I have always been worried about mixing  money with friendship, so we wrote a contract to make sure that the sale would  be handled as a business deal. Well, I should have listened to my instincts. My  neighbor has not paid me. I will now have to sue him for the money. I am very  angry and would like to sue him for as much as I can get to teach him a lesson.  Someone told me that the law allows you to get money for that very purpose. Is  that true?  </P> <P> C.K.,  </P> <P> Anaheim  </P> <P> A The type of damages to which you refer are called punitive or exemplary  damages. They cannot be recovered on an action involving a breach of a  contract. However, they can be recovered on other types of actions. You do not  mention how expensive the car is or whether you plan to retain an attorney to  represent you. If you do hire an attorney, you should discuss the possibility  of suing on a basis under which you could ask for such damages.  </P></p>

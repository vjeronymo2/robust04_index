			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: NEW YORK MERC HEAD RESIGNS IN REORGANIZATION  </P> <P> Rosemary T. McFadden, president of the New York Mercantile Exchange, has  resigned as part of a reorganization of the world's largest oil futures  exchange. She will remain an adviser to the exchange.  </P> <P> McFadden, a 39-year-old lawyer and major figure in the futures industry, helped  steer NYMEX through a period of rapid growth, changing it from a sleepy  agricultural commodity exchange into a world futures powerhouse.  </P> <P> She was able to negotiate a cash severance package of more than $500,000,  according to a source familiar with the deal.  </P> <P> NYMEX Chairman Z. Lou Guttman said that McFadden's resignation, effective July  31, is part of a restructuring plan that will allow the exchange to better  divide administrative responsibilities.  </P> <P> He said McFadden had been trying to handle the exchange's internal and external  affairs and that the NYMEX board felt she had become "overloaded" with work.  "The job had become too big for one person to handle," Guttman said.  </P> <P> In a statement, McFadden said, "It has been a rewarding and fulfilling  experience to serve the exchange. The NYMEX Board feels I can better serve the  exchange in my new strategic advisory capacity. I look forward to this  opportunity." McFadden was not available for further comment.  </P> <P> Her resignation, which was unexpected, comes at a time when NYMEX faces several  public relations problems.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, federal investigators went to the exchange's offices in  Manhattan to gather records as part of an investigation into suspected trading  abuses.  </P> <P> In addition, the exchange is under pressure from some members to modify the  delivery terms of its crude oil contract, and to decide how it will participate  in after-hours trading, a trend that is sweeping world markets.  </P> <P> R.P. Thompson, now executive vice president of NYMEX, will serve as interim  president, managing internal affairs, until a replacement is found. Thompson is  considered by some exchange sources as a likely candidate to succeed McFadden.  </P></p>

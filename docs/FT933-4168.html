			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Spanish abandon pay pact deadline THE SPANISH Government and trade union negotiators agreed last night to abandon a deadline of September 20, in their attempts to agree a wages pact. The government may now be retreating from its insistence that a pact is essential to economic recovery. Until a few days ago, senior officials in the finance ministry had been saying that the government wanted a wages deal in place by September 20, when the draft 1994 budget is to reach parliament. On the expectation of a virtual wage freeze next year, and of rises below the inflation rate for 1995 and 1996, foreign financial institutions have been making heavy purchases in recent weeks of Spanish debt. The wages deal was to have been the centre of a so-called social pact - to encompass pensions, labour market reform and unemployment benefits  - designed by the government in an effort to trim its large deficits. But, after meeting the unions and employers yesterday, Mr Pedro Solbes, finance minister, said talks before the budget debate closes on September 30 would concentrate solely on issues that directly affected budget planning. These talks would start next Monday, he said, and cover changes the government wants to make in the way it calculates pensions - using forecast, not past, inflation - for next year and proposed cuts in unemployment benefit. Mr Solbes said that, if there were no agreement this month, the government would set its own budget targets. Prospects may not be bright. The unions will insist on a 'realistic', or high, inflation target and strongly oppose any meaningful cuts in benefits, which also fell sharply last year. If the government has to impose targets in order to present its budget on time, then negotiating a wages deal and labour market reform - which Mr Solbes said would start in October - could become difficult. Even so, Mr Jose Antonio Grinan, labour minister, denied last night that the wages talks had been delayed. He said the government was still aiming for a three-year deal and that the real test was whether it began on time, on January 1.</p>

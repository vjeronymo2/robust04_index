			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Vaz plea for Abu Dhabi BCCI cash MR Keith Vaz, the Labour MP who chairs the parliamentary group on Bank of Credit and Commerce International, went to Abu Dhabi yesterday with a fresh appeal to its ruler. Mr Vaz intends to give a letter signed by 150 MPs to Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al-Nayhan urging him to raise his offer of compensation to depositors and creditors of the bank. Mr Vaz said he was determined to raise the level of the Pounds 937m settlement negotiated by liquidators Touche Ross and Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholder of BCCI. The High Court has adjourned the liquidation hearing until June 8 for creditors to seek 'clarification' of the deal.</p>

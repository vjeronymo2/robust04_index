			<p>BFN     [Text] Sao Paulo -- The Sao Paulo State Attorney's Office  will investigate charges that 11 members of the Institute for  Nuclear and Energy Research (Ipen) in Sao Paulo have been  contaminated by radioactive material while working at one of the  Ipen laboratories, which is controlled by the National Nuclear  Energy Commission (CNEN). The Association of Ipen Employees  (Assipen) and the Federal Employees Union in Sao Paulo  (Sindisef) have stated that the Ipen employees -- five women and  six men who operated machinery at the pharmaceuticals laboratory  -- were contaminated by breathing Iodine- 131.    Ipen employees' representatives have reported that the  contamination was detected through tests last month. Assipen  Director Claudio Manoel Constancio said that the employees had a  hormonal dysfunction in their thyroid glands, and that some of  them had nodules and cysts in their glands. According to  Constancio, Iodine-131 causes thyroid hyperactivity.    CNEN Radioprotection Director Laercio Vinhas yesterday  reported by fax that the thyroid dysfunctions detected in the  employees have no relation whatsoever with their work at the  laboratory and that this problem is detected in 3 percent of the  overall population. Vinhas added that only seven workers, and  not 11, have been given sick leave because medical literature  does not prohibit people with thyroid dysfunctions from working  with iodine mixtures.    The affected employees refused to comment on the issue and,  according to the Assipen director, fear retaliation by the  company. Constancio said that the CNEN and Ipen have maintained  absolute secrecy about the subject. Prosecutors who work for  the Job Accidents Division of the Attorney General's Office have  already summoned the company's superintendent, Spero Penha  Morato, to clarify the situation during a meeting to be held on  2 May.    The employees' representatives want doctors and experts of  the Fundacentro, an organization linked to the Labor Ministry  that is responsible for controlling workers' health, to examine  the Ipen facilities at the Sao Paulo University campus.</p>

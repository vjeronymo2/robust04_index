			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): German strike ballot result unsettles late-closers NEWS in the afternoon that German steelworkers had voted overwhelmingly in favour of a strike brought late-closing bourses off their highs, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT overcame a bout of midsession profit-taking to continue its upward trend. The DAX index rose 6.58 to 1,687.49, up 1.4 per cent on the week, while the FAZ index, calculated at midsession, rose 3.83 to 683.17, a rise of 0.8 per cent on the week. Volume was estimated at below Thursday's DM6.6bn. The luxury car manufacturer BMW jumped DM12.50 to DM536 on the back of the previous day's news that group sales rose 9.8 per cent in 1991 and should rise this year. Steels were firmer ahead of the strike ballot results. Thyssen rose DM1.50 to DM220, Hoesch firmed DM1 to DM258 and Mannesmann added DM1.80 to DM268.80. Degussa added DM2.50 to DM335 before announcing a bigger-than-expected cut in the dividend to DM7 from DM11. Commerzbank, which has lagged behind the banking sector recently, stood out with a DM5.10 rise to DM263.60. PARIS saw its heaviest volume in about six months as stock index futures and options expired. The CAC-40 index came off the day's high of 1,895.79 to close 1.31 better at 1,875.25 in volume of FFr4.9bn. The banking sector stole the limelight. Paribas, which announced a 1991 loss after the close on Thursday, rose FFr16 or 4.6 per cent with a hefty 783,500 shares traded. Analysts said the stock was pushed up by professional short-covering and also by news that Paribas was holding the dividend in spite of the loss. CCF was also active following an upbeat presentation to fund managers in London yesterday. The stock rose FFr5.90 to FFr189.90 on 594,340 shares traded. MILAN closed slightly higher after a volatile session. The Comit index rose 3.56 to 541.37, down 1.4 per cent on the week, in turnover estimated at slightly below Thursday's L97bn. The approval by the lower house after hours on Thursday of legislation designed to protect minority shareholders during takeovers lifted shares in state-controlled companies which are earmarked for privatisation. The cement group Cementir, rose L125 or 4.6 per cent to L2,860. Eridania gained L205 to L7,210 ahead of details of the share exchange operation with Beghin Say, its French subsidiary. AMSTERDAM was mixed with most interest on Elsevier which finished up Fl 3.40 to a all-time high of Fl 108.00. The CBS Tendency Index moved up 0.7 to 121.7, barely changed on the week. The strength of Elsevier spilled over into Wolters Kluwer, which gained Fl 0.60 to Fl 66.40 and VNU Fl 0.20 to Fl 83.20. Akzo, the chemical group, shed Fl 1.30 to Fl 134.00 on news that it was holding its dividend and taking a net charge of Fl 110m due to reorganisation. KLM rose Fl 1.30 to Fl 40.30 ahead of third-quarter results out next Thursday. ZURICH ended quietly with banks recovering some of their losses after Credit Suisse was downgraded by Moody's earlier in the week and Swiss Bank was placed on the US credit rating agency's watchlist. Swiss Bank bearers put on SFr3 to SFr300 and CS holding, parent company of Credit Suisse, gained SFr5 to SFr1,905. The all-share SPI index rose 4.6 to 1,111.4, steady on the week. Bearer shares in Georg Fischer, the engineering group, fell SFr15 to SFr990 after it told shareholders it expected a decline in last year's profit. STOCKHOLM finished slightly up with the slide in Volvo stock coming to an end. The Affarsvarlden General Index rose 2.6 to 970.1, but was down 1.5 per cent on the week. Volvo B firmed SKr3 to SKr381, with Procordia B unchanged at SKr198. Electrolux B were off another SKr3 to SKr236 on concerns about Tuesday's preliminary results.

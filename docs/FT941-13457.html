			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / International Company News: Gains from sale of investments helps CGIP to maintain profits Capital gains from the sale of investments should allow CGIP, the French holding company, to report steady profits for 1993, according to Mr Ernest-Antoine Seilliere, the group chairman. Mr Seilliere described 1993 as a difficult year. But during an interview he said that 'after taking into account a net capital gain of FFr150m (Dollars 25.68m) from disposals made in the course of the year, we will maintain without doubt our profit compared with 1992'. Then, CGIP reported net profits of FFr542.6m. The disposals made during the year included a 2.5 per cent stake in Valeo, the vehicle components group, and 4.4 per cent of Cap Gemini Sogeti, the computer services group. The holding company has rebuilt its reserves through a convertible bond issue at the beginning of this month. The issue, which raised about FFr1bn, was aimed at strengthening the group's balance sheet following a number of acquisitions and an increase in its stake in CarnaudMetalBox, the Anglo-French packaging group, from 25.3 per cent to just over 32 per cent. Mr Seilliere ruled out the possibility of a merger between the holding company and the packaging group. 'CGIP is evolving in a logic of control which is favourable to our shareholders. The hypothesis of a merger is not envisaged' he said. He said that a decision on the group's dividend would be taken by the shareholders' assembly in June. 'Between now and then we will have a clearer view of the development of our investments which, we hope, will allow us to continue our policy of distribution.' he said. CGIP, which paid a dividend of FFr32 in 1992, has generally increased its dividend payments.</p>

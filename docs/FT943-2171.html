			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Mauroy hitches bandwagon to TGV Mr Pierre Mauroy yesterday inaugurated a FFr800m (Pounds 96m) shopping centre, the latest stage in the colossal 'Euralille' commercial/transport project in the centre of the north French city. The venture forms a key part of his campaign to win a fifth six-year term as mayor of Lille next year. The former Socialist prime minister has been mentioned as a possible Socialist presidential candidate if Mr Jacques Delors decides not to run. But despite recent conservative inroads into his Socialist bastion, Mr Mauroy's enthusiasm for municipal politics seems undimmed. To bolster his record as mayor since 1971, he is counting heavily on the Euralille project and on Mr Delors' own daughter, Mrs Martine Aubry, the former labour minister, who is running on his ticket as first deputy mayor in the June 1995 municipal elections. But the politically double-edged nature of the Euralille project was underlined yesterday when organisers of the new 66,500 square metre commercial centre admitted that they had deliberately turned away textile and clothing companies wanting to install themselves in the new centre in order to protect these traditional industries of Lille, where unemployment is already more than 13 per cent. 'In the interests of diversification, we decided to make leisure and beauty a major theme of the centre which is now 95 per cent filled,' one organiser said coyly. Exploiting the local textile industry's anxiety, Mr Alex Turk, a Gaullist RPR law professor running for mayor against Mr Mauroy has criticised the Euralille project for siphoning too much money away from other social services and for over-emphasising commercial development, rather than just settling for the still-ambitious goal of making Lille the hub of new TGV high-speed train services between Paris, London and eventually Brussels. Mr Jean-Paul Baietto, overall director of Euralille, said yesterday that the city had only sunk FFr84m directly into the project, with its main contribution being the gift of 70 hectares city centre site which had been in French army hands from the 17th century until the early 1980s. More than FFr3bn of the total investment was from the private sector, and much of the balance from central and regional government and French railways. But the delayed start to full commercial TGV services through the Channel Tunnel was in danger of unbalancing the project, he conceded. Some delay has been welcome, he said, because Lille started its TGV station well after work on the Chunnel began. But the Lille station was finished last May, 'and we will be in trouble if the Eurostar (TGV) trains don't start arriving by next May', he said. The next chunks of Euralille, described as Europe's biggest city renewal project, due to open are a 5,000 seat theatre in November and a World Trade Centre next January. The latter is supposed to provide a variety of services to travelling businessmen. The trade centre will include apartments, temporary offices, and banks and travel agencies, and as such it is highly dependent on the Eurostars bringing in the businessmen.</p>

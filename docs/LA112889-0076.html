			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GROUP CHALLENGES WELLS FARGO HIRING, LENDING PRACTICES  </P> <P> In what may put more pressure on banks to expand lending to low-income groups,  a coalition of California civil rights and business groups on Monday asked  regulators to block Wells Fargo Bank's proposed acquisition of American  National Bank because of Wells' alleged failure to follow equal opportunity  employment and lending practices.  </P> <P> The complaint is among a growing number of challenges of bank mergers by  community groups nationwide under the federal Community Reinvestment Act. The  1977 law allows regulators reviewing bank mergers to consider whether those  financial institutions are making loans and providing credit in the  neighborhoods where their depositors live.  </P> <P> In an 11-page letter sent to the federal Office of the Comptroller of the  Currency -- which regulates national banks including Wells Fargo -- the Latino  Issues Forum, Black Business Assn. of Los Angeles and 24 other groups  complained that Wells Fargo has a poor record of lending to low-income and  minority groups because the bank favors risky "leveraged buyouts at the expense  of (meeting) community needs."  </P> <P> The group, which asked the Comptroller to conduct an audit of Wells Fargo and  hold a public hearing on its claims, also alleged that Wells is the only major  California bank that has no blacks, Asians or Latinos on its board and that  only three of its top 125 managers are minorities.  </P> <P> San Francisco-based Wells Fargo acknowledged that it currently has no  minorities on its 15-member board and analysts say it is one of the largest  lenders to highly leveraged transactions in the nation -- with about $3.1  billion in leveraged buyout loans outstanding in 1988.  </P> <P> But Betty Lattie, a Wells Fargo vice president in San Francisco, said the  coalition was citing erroneous and misleading figures to bolster its claims.  </P> <P> Lattie said leveraged buyout transactions financed by Wells Fargo represent  less than one-tenth of the bank's $37.7-billion loan portfolio. She also said  that Wells Fargo has had minorities on its board in past years and currently  has more than three minorities among its 125 top managers.  </P> <P> "It is not in our interests to be against California," Lattie said. "It's in  our interest to meet community needs."  </P> <P> Wells Fargo, the state's third-largest bank with $48 billion in assets, has  been buying smaller banks recently as it seeks to expand in California through  acquisitions. In September, it agreed to acquire American National Bank for  about $160 million. American, which is owned by Central Pacific Corp. of  Bakersfield, has 28 branches from Modesto to San Bernardino.  </P> <P> Knowledgeable federal regulators could not be reached for comment Monday. But  in recent months, a number of protests similar to the one filed against Wells  Fargo have been lodged against First Interstate Bank, Security Pacific Bank and  other banks across the country by various community organizations.  </P> <P> Most of the complaints, which have met with mixed success, have relied on  community service provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act to try to  persuade banks to increase services and lending to minorities and those with  low incomes.  </P> <P> The protests recall the citizens activist movement that enveloped the nation's  broadcasters after former Federal Communications Commission member Nicholas  Johnson wrote a book in 1970 called "How to Talk Back to Your Television Set."  The book, which criticized stations' alleged failure to broadcast in the public  interest, prompted dozens of challenges to television and radio broadcast  licenses by civil rights and community groups.  </P> <P> Such grass-root protest movements waned in the 1980s during the climate of  federal deregulation encouraged during the Reagan Administration. But in recent  years, with increased nationwide concern over issues such as housing, the  environment and drug safety, citizen groups have again turned to federal  regulators for help, especially in encouraging banks to lend to low-income  consumers and do more to finance community redevelopment.  </P> <P> "They have discovered a new weapon," said Joe Belew, president of the Consumer  Bankers Assn., a suburban Washington trade group that represents large retail  banks such as Wells Fargo. "I'm very concerned, and I think the entire industry  is concerned, that the CRA act is being misused."  </P> <P> In February, for example, the Federal Reserve Board turned down a request by  Continental Illinois National Bank of Chicago to buy a small bank in Arizona  after the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union used the Community  Reinvestment Act to challenge Continental's alleged failure to serve low-income  residents. In blocking the merger, the Fed said Continental "did not have a  plan" for complying with the act and "made no significant effort to ascertain  the credit needs of its communities."  </P> <P> More recently in October, the Fed delayed action on the proposed merger between  Charlotte-based First Union Corp. and Florida National Banks of Jacksonville  after the Charlotte Reinvestment Alliance picketed First Union headquarters,  claiming that just 5.8% of the bank's mortgage loans went to minority groups  representing 21.8% of the area's population.  </P> <P> The protests were dropped Monday after First Union announced that it would  provide $9 million in mortgages and business loans to low-income neighborhoods  in Charlotte.  </P></p>

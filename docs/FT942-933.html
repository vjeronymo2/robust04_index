			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Rare opportunity for WTO to seize Sir, You reported that the Mexican foreign ministry is consulting other governments about the possibility of President Salinas getting the top job at the incipient World Trade Organisation (WTO) ('Salinas may join race to head WTO', June 10). On June 15 you reported that Germany has made a formal bid for the WTO to move to Bonn ('Bonn offered as base for WTO'). What is important is that the WTO be launched as a new and powerful organisation, albeit with roots in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, but not merely as a revitalised or remodelled Gatt. WTO will commence with more than 120 countries and will have broad powers to maintain and enhance the multilateral trading system. Much can be learned from the Gatt experience over the past decades but that must be balanced against the fact and perception that the WTO is a vastly different entity, in membership, in powers, and in responsibilities. The idea of having a former head of state of a major developing country which literally bet the future of its economy on throwing open markets, joining Gatt, and welcoming import competition and foreign investments is a rare opportunity which should be seized. This is no reflection on the worth of the announced candidates who are competent. However, the Salinas candidacy is an opportunity to be seized to re-enforce the point that the WTO is both new and is to be one of the world's most important organisations. As for moving to Bonn, here again there is much to be said for a new location denoting a new organisation. The German bid should be seen in that light and weighed against the obvious conveniences of remaining in Geneva where so many countries have joint missions to the WTO, WIPO, and UNCTAD. It inevitably raises the question of whether the world needs all of these overlapping organisations if the WTO becomes near-universal in its membership.

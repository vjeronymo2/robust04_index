			<p><P> December 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FISH REPORT: OUTDOORS;  </P> <P> HEAT MEANS SHIFTING GEAR  </P> <P> The trout have become sluggish and the largemouth bass active at Lake Castaic,  probably because of the absence of cold weather.  </P> <P> In any case, fishermen have been making the switch in gear and in many cases  pulling in trophy bass.  </P> <P> Scott Uradomo of Carson used a mudsucker to entice a 15 1/2-pound largemouth.  Lee Hunt of Northridge caught a 12-pounder.  </P> <P> LAKE MEAD -- Striped bass most active in lower basin, biting on surface in  mornings and at 30-40 feet on live shad or frozen anchovies in afternoons.  </P> <P> LAKE HAVASU -- Striped bass between two and six pounds biting at 40 feet on  deep-running lures, live shad and frozen anchovies. Black bass slow, most taken  on plastic worms. Catfish slow and scattered, biting best on anchovies.  </P> <P> BULLHEAD CITY -- Striped bass providing most action, boiling on Lake Mohave,  taken on shallow- to medium-running lures in mornings, anchovies down deep  during day. Trout fair on river. Few limits.  </P> <P> SALTON SEA -- Orangemouth corvina slow, biting best off State Park jetty.  Croaker and tilapia scattered. Nightcrawlers best bet.  </P> <P> LAKE CACHUMA -- Trout planted recently, but elusive so far. Shore fishermen  using cheese or nightcrawlers doing best. Trollers using four colors and  needlefish lures catching some in deep channels. Largemouth bass biting mainly  near dropoffs at 8-30 feet. Catfish slow.  </P> <P> PYRAMID LAKE -- Crappie, bluegill and small largemouth bass biting on small  spinners and Rapalas at Yellow Bar and dam.

Kevin Pendleton, Lancaster, 12-pound striper. Catfish between five and  seven pounds biting mainly in channel.  </P> <P> LAKE CASTAIC -- Largemouth bass picking up, several limits. Marshall Adcock,  Granada Hills, 8 1/4-pounds, caught in upper lake. Other species slow.  </P> <P> IRVINE LAKE -- Trout most active at West Shore and Sierra Cove, biting on most  baits.  </P> <P> PERRIS LAKE -- Largemouth bass biting primarily at east end of lake.

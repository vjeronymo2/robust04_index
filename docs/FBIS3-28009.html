			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, Feb. 1 (YONHAP) -- The human rights  situation in South Korea since the inauguration of President Kim  Yong-sam in 1993 has improved significantly except for cases  involving communism and North Korea, the U.S. State Department  says. In North Korea, President Kim Il-song's regime is  repressive and subjects its citizens to rigid controls, the  State Department said in a report issued Tuesday on the human  rights situation around the world in 1993. The North Korean  regime establishes security ratings for each individual which  determine access to employment, schools, medical facilities and  certain stores as well as admission to the Workers' (Communist)  Party. But this loyalty system appears to have been relaxed  somewhat in recent years, the report said.    In China, there has been "partial progress" but changes have  been limited, the report said, foreshadowing continued friction  between the United States and China over human rights.  Washington is expected to continue to press Beijing for  improvement in human rights conditions in return for most  favored nation (MFN) trade privileges.    "The overall human rights situation improved significantly  (in South Korea)," the report said. This was "a result of the  fundamental shift in attitude and policy of the Kim Yong-sam  administration. President Kim achieved two democratic,  institutional reforms of an historic nature: The abolition of  false-name bank accounts and the enactment of a government  ethics law," it said.    "The government also decreed several amnesties that  released,  reduced the prison sentences of, or erased the criminal records  of, hundreds of persons arrested for politically motivated  acts," it said.    Nevertheless, the Kim administration, insisting that the  National Security Law (NSL) is designed to thwart subversion by  pro-North Korean forces, continued to use it to violate freedom  of expression, association and travel, it said.    "The (Seoul) government invoked the NSL less, however, and  NSL arrests declined by over half," it added.    On North Korea, it said the regime detains about 150,000  political prisoners and family members in maximum security camps  in remote areas. An October 1992 report by two former inmates  made reference to the severe living conditions in what they  called "concentration camps," it said. One credible report  lists 12 such prison camps that are believed to exist in North  Korea, it said.    Koreans with relatives who fled to the South during the  Korean war appear to still be classified as part of the "hostile  class," it said.    The report quoted defector Cho Kap-chae as estimating that  the "impure" class may comprise 25 to 30 percent of the  population. "Members of this class may still be subject to some  discrimination, although Cho claimed that their treatment has  improved greatly in recent years," it said.    Political prisoners, opponents of Kim Il-song and his son  and  heir apparent, Kim Chong-il, repatriated defectors and others  have been summarily executed, it said.    North Korea equates "political criminals" with those who  criticize the regime, it said. "Numerous other reports suggest  that in the past political offenses included such forms of less  majesty as sitting on newspapers bearing Kim Il-song's picture."</p>

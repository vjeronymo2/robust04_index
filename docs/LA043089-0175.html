			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> DALE MURPHY'S BAT SHOWING SOME SIGNS OF LIFE  </P> <P> For years, Dale Murphy, a two-time National League MVP, was about all the  Atlanta Braves had going for them. Not anymore.  </P> <P> The Atlanta organization is stocked with promising young pitchers, a number of  starters are hitting in the .300 range and the Braves are battling for first  place in the National League West.  </P> <P> All this and Murphy's bat has been mostly invisible. His spring training was  horrible and he began the season the same way -- 3 for 27 in his first eight  games.  </P> <P> Through 15 games, he was at .136 with just five RBI. "And it wasn't like I  didn't have chances," Murphy said before Tuesday night's 2-1 loss to the New  York Mets. "The guys in front of me are all hitting over .300."  </P> <P> Things got so bad that last Wednesday, when a stray dog was brought into the  Braves' clubhouse and Murphy decided to take it home, his wife, Nancy,  suggested they call the dog "Slumper." Always the optimist, Murphy opted for  "Candy."  </P> <P> Before striking out three times against the Mets Tuesday night, the career .274  hitter gave strong indications that he was breaking out of the worst and  longest drought of his career. But as unwelcome as Murphy's slump has been, it  has shown the Braves they can at least tread water without their franchise  player. "We won a lot of games without him getting hits at all," Manager Russ  Nixon said. "It makes it a lot easier when he does -- as witnessed Sunday."  </P> <P> On that day, Murphy went 4 for 5, driving in six runs as the Braves defeated  the San Diego Padres, 9-4. In the four-game series against San Diego, Murphy  broke out, going 8 for 17 with three home runs and 10 RBI. "I've always been  kind of streaky," said Murphy, who is unconvinced this is the end of his  troubles. "For me, it's not all of a sudden and it's over with. It's a  day-to-day thing I have to work on. I don't feel I have a swing that's always  there."  </P> <P> Until this winter, everyone figured the 33-year-old would forever be a Brave.  But after his sub-Murphy season in 1988 -- .226, 24 homers, 77 RBI -- his name  was bandied about in trade talks with the Mets, the Padres and the Houston  Astros.  </P> <P> "It really hasn't been a big hassle or a big problem," Murphy said of the trade  talk. "It has stopped. All I've told the Braves is, if something comes up that  they feel is beneficial to me, I'd look at it. Every player in the game  realizes he may not be on the same team forever."  </P> <P> All talk of moving Murphy was stopped by the slump. Midway through it, Nixon  decided to move him out of the cleanup spot. But unlike some other managers, he  moved his heavy hitter up to the No. 2 spot, not down, for more at-bats and  less pressure.  </P> <P> "That was when he was going really badly and we wanted to get his mind off  being in the cleanup spot and let him stop worrying about driving in runs and  just loosen up," Nixon said. "He's worked extremely hard at it."  </P> <P> "Russ has shown great patience with me," Murphy said. "But I don't think anyone  owes me anything."  </P> <P> Murphy took extra batting practice and worked with batting coach Clarence  Jones. "I felt he was letting the ball get too close to him," Jones said. "He  was waiting too long for the ball. I think he's out of it now."  </P> <P> After the hitting spree against the Padres, Murphy is a month ahead of his 1988  RBI pace of 77. He is hitting .200 (16 for 80) with four homers and 15 RBI.  </P> <P> But for almost three weeks, the Braves were carrying Murphy and not vice versa.  "It's been frustrating, but it helps when you're not doing exactly what you  want to be doing and the team's winning anyway," he said. "It means there are  24 guys on this team who can play. It doesn't matter how good one person does."  </P></p>

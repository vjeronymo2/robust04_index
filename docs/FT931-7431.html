			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / International Company News: Air Canada seeks 5% pay cuts for two years AIR CANADA has asked all its employees to take a 5 per cent pay cut for two years and receive 'share appreciation rights' to compensate. The company's payroll is 19,000, down 3,000 since 1990, and the pay cut would save about CDollars 100m (USDollars 80m) over the two years. Mr Hollis Harris, Air Canada president, said the airline would make a small operating profit in 1993 and post a final loss, including special charges, of about CDollars 200m. Its immediate objective was to reverse the 1992 decline in yields. He appealed directly to all operating and maintenance employees over the proposed pay cut. But the appeal was immediately rejected by the three biggest unions, which said they had already accepted a one-year freeze. Under share-appreciation rights, employees would receive Air Canada stock according to the amount of an individual's pay reduction. The hope would be that the value of the stock would rise as the company recovered. Mr Harris said senior staff would take the 5 per cent cut and he himself would accept a 10 per cent cut. Air Canada, which last Friday disclosed a CDollars 454m final loss for 1992 after restructuring charges, plans to reduce domestic capacity by 10 per cent this year while increasing international capacity. The airline is delaying 1993-94 delivery of six Boeing 767-300 aircraft worth CDollars 700m until 1996-97, and is selling its last Boeing 727s. It hopes to complete sale-and-leaseback deals for three new 747-400s and five Airbus A320s to free nearly CDollars 1bn in cash. Mr Harris said that Air Canada was ready to restart talks for a merger with Canadian Airlines if its parent, PWA, failed to sign an ownership and operating pact with American Airlines. Andres Soriano, one of three Philippine family-controlled groups which set up PR Holdings, a consortium to take a 67 per cent stake in Philippine Airlines (PAL), has sold its 5 per cent stake in the consortium, Reuter reports from Manila. The sale means the loss of a key ally for Mr Antonio Cojuangco, the embattled PAL chairman. Mr Cojuangco and Mr Lucio Tan, a Chinese-Filipino businessman, have been embroiled in a boardroom tussle for control of PAL. Soriano did not reveal the purchaser of the stake but said it was not Mr Tan.</p>

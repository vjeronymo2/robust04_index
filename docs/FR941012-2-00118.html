Rule 17F&hyph;5 specifies entities located outside the United States that are eligible to serve as custodian for investment company assets. One such entity is a banking institution or trust company incorporated or organized under the laws of a country other than the United States that is regulated as such by the country's government or an agency thereof and that has shareholders' equity in excess of U.S. $200 million. SBSA qualifies as a an eligible foreign custodian. The Foreign Affiliates do not qualify as eligible foreign custodian under rule 17f&hyph;5 only because they do not meet the minimum shareholders' equity requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicant's Conditions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> SBSA agrees that an order granting the requested relief may be conditioned upon the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The proposed foreign custody arrangements regarding the Foreign Affiliates satisfy the requirements of rule 17f&hyph;5 in all respects other than the Foreign Affiliates' level of shareholders' equity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. SBSA will deposit the Assets with a Foreign Affiliate only in accordance with an agreement (the ``Agreement'') required to remain in effect at all times during which the Foreign Affiliate fails to satisfy the requirements of rule 17f&hyph;5. Each Agreement will be a three-party agreement among SBSA, the Foreign Affiliate and the U.S. investment company (or its custodian). Under the Agreement, SBSA will undertake to provide specified custodial or subcustodial services for a U.S. investment company or its custodian, and will delegate to the Foreign Affiliate such of the duties and obligations of SBSA as will be necessary to permit the Foreign Affiliate to hold in custody the U.S. investment company's Assets in the relevant country. The Agreement will further provide that SBSA will be liable for any loss, damage, cost, expense, liability, or claim arising out of or in connection with the performance by the Foreign Affiliate of its responsibilities under the Agreement to the same extent as if SBSA had been required to provide custody services under such agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.

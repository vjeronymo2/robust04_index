			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Civilian MoD cut may miss target Senior defence officials admitted yesterday that the Ministry of Defence might not meet its target of cutting 20 per cent of civilian staff by 1995-96. However, they rejected charges made by the all-party Commons defence committee that the ministry would be lumbered with 'an unaffordable civilian-manned infrastructure.' Responding to sharp criticism from the committee about the progress on manpower cuts, the officials said it was 'not certain' that the ministry would achieve the planned reduction. The officials said cutting manpower by 20 per cent was not necessarily an overriding aim. In many cases it was cheaper to fill posts with civilians than members of the armed forces. The committee, in a brief report timed to precede the public expenditure announcements in next week's Budget, called for an 'urgent reassessment' of the strategy for achieving cuts in the MoD's 155,000-strong civilian workforce. 'Although there have been some reductions in UK-based civilian numbers, the rate of decline is now substantially slower than in the services, is not centrally managed, and may even be reversed,' the committee said. The MoD argues that civilian employment has been cut by 135,000 since 1979. However, this figure includes 40,000 jobs in Royal Ordance munitions factories, naval dockyards and the Atomic Weapons Establishment which have been transferred to the private sector. 'We feel we have actually done quite well,' one official said. The committee report also criticised the relatively slow fall in officer numbers in the armed forces, especially senior ranks in the army and RAF.

			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / BT set for trials of video scheme British Telecom will officially confirm for the first time today that it is pushing ahead with trials of its new video-on-demand system using ordinary telephone lines. BT will test the system which sends television pictures down telephone lines to around 100 homes in Essex this spring. Programmes are being provided for the experiment from a group of organisations including the BBC, London Weekend Television, Kingfisher, the retail group and Pearson, owner of the Financial Times. Video-on-demand allows consumers to order programmes and films of their choice from a central database. The extension of the system to the 24m homes on BT's national telephone network would involve an investment of several billion pounds. If the spring experiment goes well BT will move to the next stage towards the end of this year - a commercial experiment in the Colchester, Essex, which could involve up to a quarter of a million homes. At the same time BT plans to test video-on-demand with subscribers to Westminster Cable, the telephone group's central London cable television franchise. The aim of the two experiments is to see whether there is a market for the service before deciding on a national launch sometime next year. The launch will probably be phased in over three or four years. BT is confident after exploratory talks with most of the Hollywood studios that it will be able to get access to the latest films. It hopes that the studios will make films available for video-on-demand at the same time as they become available in video shops.</p>

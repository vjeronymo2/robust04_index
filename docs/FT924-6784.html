			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / International Company News: Asarco shakes up divisions as focus shifts ASARCO, one of the world's largest non-ferrous metals producers, is reorganising its business divisions to reflect its new thrust as an integrated mining company. The company, now organised around mining, smelting and refining operations, is restructuring into two new divisions, one comprising all its copper mining and processing businesses, and a second covering its lead/zinc and aggregates businesses. Asarco's specialty chemicals business will not be affected by the change. 'The focus of Asarco's business strategy since 1985 has been on acquiring ore reserves and expanding our mining capabilities,' said Mr Richard Osborne Asarco, chairman. With expansion projects at Mission and Ray copper mines in Arizona completed this year, and modernisation work on its El Paso, Texas, smelter scheduled to be finished in early 1993, Mr Osborne said the company had met its goal of becoming a fully integrated producer of copper, and of lead in Missouri. The expansions and improvements were made over a five-year period at a cost of about Dollars 1.1bn. Capacity of its Mission copper mine was expanded by 42 per cent, and operations at the Ray mine, also in Arizona, expanded by about 58 per cent. Asarco mined 78,900 tons of copper in the third quarter, and 31,400 tons of lead. In 1991, Asarco had copper sales of Dollars 1.03bn.</p>

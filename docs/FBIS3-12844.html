Mr. Qian and his delegation are expected to  stay in Iran for two days. A top-ranking political- economic  delegation accompanies Mr. Qian Qichen in his visit to Iran.    Shortly after arriving, China's foreign minister took part  in  a press conference, which was also attended by Iran's foreign  minister. The visiting Chinese official expressed his happiness  at being in Iran and referred to Sino-Iranian ties as sincere  and fruitful. Pointing to the Islamic Republic of Iran as a  country bridging Asia and Europe, Mr. Qian added: The Republic  of China believes establishing healthy relations with Iran  should bear positive effects not only in the region, but also in  the world arena.    China's deputy prime minister then referred to the two  states' economic ties and said:    [Begin Qian recording in Chinese, with superimposed English  translation] The level of trade exchanges between China and Iran  are satisfactory; declaring that both nations are willing to  expand reciprocal cooperation in various economic fields. [end  recording]    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Foreign  Minister, how do you view Mr. Qian's visit to Iran and what  issues are likely to be discussed between you and your Chinese  counterpart?    [Velayati] In the Name of God, the Merciful, the  Compassionate. Mr. Qian Qichen is my old friend and has been the  Foreign Minister of China since a long time ago. During last few  years he paid one official visit to our country, and this is the  second official visit which he has paid to our country on the  basis of my invitation; and we are going to talk about the  bilateral and also international issues. You know that after  the Islamic revolution we have promoted our relations with China  in different fields. And also as far as the international  affairs are concerned, we have had very close cooperation during  the last years, especially in the United Nations and other  international organizations.    Recently in Jakarta, China was accepted as an observer in  the  Nonaligned Movement. So, not only at the United Nations, but  also in the Nonaligned Movement we cooperate together. Iran and  China as two important Asian countries can play a very important  role for peace and tranquillity in this part of the world.    [Correspondent] Thank you. [end recording]    Regional issues, including the Palestinian question, are  among the most crucial topics which the two sides said they will  take into serious consideration. The Chinese foreign minister  stated his country strongly condemns the massacre of Muslim  Palestinians by the Zionist soldiers in the town of Hebron in  the occupied land.    As for the uproar by the West on human rights in China, Mr.  Qian Qichen said: China does not allow any foreign country to  interfere in its internal affairs, adding that his country acts  on the basis of China's judicial laws and system, not on the  basis of the criteria favored by the West.    At the end of the press conference, the two foreign  ministers  emphasized joint participation in the international meetings and  gatherings, and hoped that Iran and China would adopt further  common policies towards regional and global affairs.    Iran and China have long enjoyed most friendly mutual  relations. Mr. Qian's visit, however, is viewed as an affair to  further activate the two countries' bilateral cooperation  concerning regional and international issues.</p>

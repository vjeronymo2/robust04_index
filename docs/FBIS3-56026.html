In the opinion of several experts it will still take much  time for the conflict to be finally settled; after all, it is  not for nothing that people say that it is enough for there to  be a single shot for a war to last 100 years.    But nevertheless, in spite of the difficulties, a Russian  Federation MVD operational inquiry group investigation team is  working fairly fruitfully. It is taking measures to search out  criminals, people who have disappeared without trace during the  conflict, to establish the identity of unidentified corpses,  free hostages, and establish the possible sites where dead  citizens have been buried. In the space of only one month the  group has established the fate of 25 citizens who disappeared  without trace, operations to detain particularly dangerous  criminals have been mounted, and possible locations where  hostages are being held and dead citizens are buried have been  checked. For example, acting on fresh information, the  investigation team led by Lieutenant Colonel of the Militia Petr  Baranov discovered two illegal burial sites containing 11  corpses in the region of the settlement of Oktyabrskiy. They  were all identified and handed over to the relatives of the  deceased.    Staffers of State Motor Vehicle Inspection Administration  subunits have also had their work cut out in the state of  emergency zone. Suffice it to say that they have examined more  than 10,000 motor vehicles at checkpoints, and have checked  serial numbers on the units and assemblies of more than 3,000  vehicles against the Russian MVD Information Center data base.  Some 43 vehicles have been impounded, mostly of foreign  production, which were being sought.    While checking and examining motor vehicles, 46 rifles, two  live grenades, as well as 17 cold-steel weapons were discovered  and confiscated.    In order to step up preventative and preemptive work in the  fight against hijacking, a raid was carried out on the territory  of the Republic of Ingushetia 6 January. In the space of six  hours, eight vehicles were impounded, which were being sought.  Upon examining them, various firearms and cold steel weapons  were discovered and confiscated.</p>

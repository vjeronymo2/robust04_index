			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Ballot box crusaders ride to foreign wars: The rise of global activism among US institutional shareholders Corporate under-performers of the world beware - the Americans are coming. US institutional investors, having stirred up corporate America over the past five years with demands for better-run businesses and more accountable managements, are beginning to flex their muscles in the other leading western economies. After years of passive investment abroad, they are starting to vote their shares (known in the US as 'proxies') at foreign companies' annual meetings  -sometimes casting them against the incumbent management. Foremost foreign crusader is the California Public Employees Retirement System, the largest public pension fund in the US and one of the most forceful leaders of the domestic corporate governance movement. In December it sent shock waves through German boardrooms when it backed a proposal by a German shareholder association to the annual meeting of RWE, the energy conglomerate. This called for one-share, one-vote in place of the RWE system that gave a majority of votes to a minority of shareholders. A Calpers representative delivered a speech declaring that it was naive for German companies to maintain voting restrictions and still expect to retain access to international capital markets. In France two months earlier, Calpers had led an unsuccessful protest against food giant BSN's move to limit the voting rights of large investors. Confrontations such as this are still unusual, but look like becoming increasingly common. A survey of US institutions released last month by the Investor Responsibility Research Centre, a non-profit-making Washington information service, found some larger ones 'gearing up to take shareholder activism worldwide in 1993'. Whether they will get results is another matter, although Mr Geoffrey Mazullo, of Washington-based Institutional Shareholder Services, which advises US investors on proxy voting, points out that the RWE protest is already having a knock-on effect. A German shareholder activist has tabled a resolution for the annual meeting of electronics giant Siemens on March 11, which calls for the abolition of special voting rights for the Siemens family and specifically mentions Calpers' RWE stand. A substantial number of experts believe a shortage of global capital, combined with the sheer size of the potential US investment pool, will make foreign companies particularly sensitive to US institutional views. The result could be to move the disparate corporate governance practices of continental Europe and Japan much closer to the Anglo-Saxon models of the US and UK. Why are US institutions sallying abroad now? The main reason is that US equity investment overseas is growing rapidly. 'With more than Dollars 250bn (Pounds 176bn) of international stocks at stake, US shareholders are saying they can't afford to ignore the hazards of different corporate governance practice abroad,' says IRRC's Mr Stephen Davis. US Department of Labor guidelines also place a fiduciary obligation on the part of many institutions to vote their proxies, although it remains unclear to what extent this covers foreign as well as US shareholdings. However, until recently it was difficult for US shareholders to vote in many foreign countries, even if they wanted to, because it was hard to get information about proxy issues in good time or to vote without running up costs, which made the exercise of dubious financial value. But over the past few years global custodian banks, whose local affiliates are the holders of records for clients' shares, have been putting much greater effort into obtaining voting material, translating it into English and then taking responsibility for executing votes. For example, TIAA-CREF, the largest US pension fund, made a special drive last year to vote in Japan, even though local companies make proxy materials available only in Japanese and send them out just two weeks before the one day in June when a huge number of Japanese annual meetings are held simultaneously. Helped by its custodians, Bankers Trust and Bank of Tokyo, the fund managed to get its hands on 250 proxies and vote them. However, the IRRC study points out that many local custodians in Germany, the Netherlands and Japan refuse to cast votes against management, even if instructed to do so by the stock-owner or global custodian, because they maintain close ties to the company. Institutions that find this a problem are likely to contract with one of the emerging global proxy voting services. ISS, which has long advised US institutions about domestic proxy issues, set up a global corporate governance service a year ago which provides voting guidelines on more than 2,000 shareholder meetings around the globe and can co-ordinate the execution of votes with custodians. At ISS's annual proxy conference, held in Washington last week, a whole workshop was devoted to global voting and the issues likely to be most important in each country this year. Increasing US interest was underlined by the IRRC survey, which showed institutions voting 40 per cent of their non-US stock in 1992, up from 24 per cent the previous year. However, voting stock does not necessarily mean opposing management - and most US investors who bother to cast ballots abroad support boardroom positions most of the time. Where they have taken issue is on certain specific questions, such as restrictions on shareholder voting rights in Germany and introduction of anti-takeover devices in France. These are the kind of basic issues on which the corporate governance movement cut its teeth in the US in the late 1980s. However, in its home territory the movement has now moved on to analysing individual companies' financial performance and pressing for management change when this is wanting. Mr Mazullo of ISS thinks US investors will eventually take a similar approach to foreign stocks, although not for some time. In many countries, he says, 'We're still trying to get very basic types of disclosure, and without that information you can't make those calculations.'</p>

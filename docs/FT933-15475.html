			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / International Company News: Mexican contractor plans IPO and seeks listing in New York GRUPO Trituradores Basalticos (Tribasa), Mexico's second-largest construction company, is poised to make an initial public offering of between Dollars 250m and Dollars 350m of shares, and obtain a New York Stock Exchange listing. While weakness in the Mexican stock market could still delay the offering, those familiar with the transaction were hopeful yesterday that it would go ahead as planned. The company expects to offer about Dollars 60m of equity in Mexico, between Dollars 125m and Dollars 185m in the US, and between Dollars 65m and Dollars 105m in Europe, for a total equivalent to around 30 per cent of its capital. Tribasa recorded profits of about Dollars 100m last year and revenues of Dollars 585m, more than 90 per cent of which came from the construction of Mexico's privately-financed toll roads. The company has built several profitable toll roads around Mexico City, and has significant stakes in the Cuernavaca-Acapulco road (263km), the Mazatlan-Culiacan road, and the unfinished Mexico City-Guadalajara road (340km). Tribasa's heavy exposure to toll roads worries some analysts, since the programme is in trouble after traffic on existing roads failed to meet projections. While the margins on the construction of toll roads have been around 25 per cent, Tribasa has been unable to sell off its equity stakes in any new roads since the successful securitisation of the Mexico City-Toluca road. Tribasa will use the proceeds from the equity offering to reduce debt it has taken on to finance toll road construction, and to expand into other infrastructure areas. The Mexican government is hoping that private sector construction companies will build and help finance new ports, airports, power and petrochemical plants, water and irrigation systems. The equity offering is being managed by Interacciones in Mexico, Lehman Brothers in the US, and SG Warburg in the UK.</p>

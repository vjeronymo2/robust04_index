			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper, aluminium and coffee shine in an eventful year - The markets in 1994 For leading world commodity markets 1994 has been a year of mixed fortunes; and for many commodity analysts a period to look back on with some embarrassment. Base metals prices, which were generally forecast to languish, remained very strong throughout; and the gold price, for which strong gains were predicted, languished. Coffee's expected modest rise turned out to be a big bull run; while cocoa failed to build as expected on its strength in late-1993. At this time last year the prices of metals traded on the London Metal Exchange were struggling to move away from historic real-term lows. Most analysts were suggesting that the recovery would be long and arduous. Nevertheless, they said, most prices would be higher in 1994 - the exception being copper, which needed to fall a little more before moving back up. How wrong most analysts were. Base metals prices have boomed. Copper and aluminium, the most heavily-traded metals, are 70 per cent above the levels ruling at the end of 1993 while even zinc, which most analysts agree has the worst near-term prospects of the LME metals, has risen by 16 per cent. Nearly everyone failed to predict the impact of two new elements in the metals markets this year: the activities of the investment funds and banks. The funds are estimated to have put USDollars 16bn (Pounds 10bn) into metals so far this year. Meanwhile, the banks probably control 75 per cent of the LME stocks - traders say that as much as 85 per cent of the exchange's aluminium stock is controlled by four or five banks. Consumers are complaining and producers, many of whom were almost suicidal a year ago, do not wholeheartedly welcome the new element in the metals markets either. High prices encourage substitution of other materials for metals and volatile prices frighten off potential metals users. Also, some producers are using the futures markets to lock in artificially high prices either to fund further development or to bolster flagging operations - moves that might bloat future supply. Nevertheless, investment fund managers say they had good reasons for buying metals: clients wanted to reduce their portfolio risk through asset diversification and to hedge against unexpected inflation. Some analysts still insist that metals prices have outrun the fundamentals of supply and demand. But others suggest the funds' timing so far has been perfect and there are solid reasons underlying this year's price rises. Mr Wiktor Bielski, metals analyst at Bain &amp; Company, a Deutsche Bank subsidiary, points out that demand for aluminium, copper and nickel rose 7 per cent in the first half of 1994, compared with the same period last year, while lead and zinc demand was up by 4 per cent. Meanwhile, supplies have fallen along with exports from the former eastern bloc - apart from those of aluminium. Some producers have had to buy metal on the LME to cover commitments. The year started well for precious metals producers. Many analysts were predicting a steady, if unspectacular, rise in the gold price well beyond Dollars 400 a troy ounce and some of the same investors who had driven up the gold price in the spring of 1993 attempted to push silver through Dollars 6 an ounce. This attempt was unsuccessful, as was gold's attack on Dollars 400. The World Gold Council points out that rising interest rates are encouraging more gold mining companies to hedge their future production and this appears to be putting a 'cap' on any price rise above Dollars 400. North American producers can now lock-in prices of about Dollars 410 an ounce for deliveries one year forward, it says. In Australian dollar terms, forward premiums look even more attractive. Interest rate increases have pushed one-year gold contangos (premiums for future delivery) to above 5 per cent. The WGC also points out that when the gold price tested the top end of the Dollars 370-Dollars 395 range, in which it has mainly traded this year, 'heavy trade selling was encountered and the price fell back'. Platinum was held back by gold's lacklustre performance - many investment funds link all the precious metals in their computer-generated trading - and supply was helped by Russia digging deep into its reserves to keep up with growing demand in the western markets. But booming world-wide demand for mobile telephones helped the price of palladium (platinum's sister metal) to double in the past year. The precious metal is needed for the multi-layer ceramic capacitors used in these telephones, as well as in a wide variety of other electronic equipment such as personal computers and the new wide-screen televisions. Few coffee traders would have thought at the end of 1993 that a year later they would regard London futures prices in the high Dollars 2,000s a tonne as somewhat disappointing. At that time the second position at the London Commodity Exchange was a whisker below Dollars 1,200 a tonne, having already been boosted by a producers' agreement to withhold supplies from the world market in an effort to lift prices to a more remunerative level. In fact, by the time that agreement - styled the 'export retention scheme' - came into effect at the beginning of October its market impact appeared already to have been discounted. Nearby LCE prices had rallied from the low Dollars 900s in July to above Dollars 1,300 in August, in anticipation of the retention scheme, before the downward reaction set in. A renewed uptrend in the early months of this year - encouraged by crop problems in various producing areas - quickly consigned the retention scheme to history by carrying prices above its target level. But traders saw that as a 'bubble' waiting to burst. They were concerned about the growing influence in the rise of the US investment funds, which might pull out of the market even more quickly than they had entered it. There were signs that that might be happening late in May when a surge to within Dollars 20 of the Dollars 2,500-a-tonne mark for the second position was followed by a Dollars 400-plus plunge in the space of two days. In the event prices stabilised, and by mid-June any thoughts of a speculative sell-off had been dismissed following news that growing areas in Brazil, the world's biggest producer by far, had suffered a damaging frost that had severely hit flowering for the 1995-95 crop. That pushed the second position price above Dollars 3,000 a tonne; and four weeks later it topped Dollars 4,000 to reach the highest level for 8 1/2 years after a second frost struck in Brazil. After another retreat prices were driven to fresh 8 1/2 -year highs in September by more Brazilian weather worries - this time drought. But that proved to be the peak. Since the rains came in mid-October the overall trend has been downwards and the second position closed yesterday at Dollars 2,876 a tonne, still 140 per cent up on the year but Dollars 1,260 off the peak. With weather worries off the agenda for the time being analysts have been taking a more sober view of crop prospects and turning their minds increasingly to the demand side of the equation. At today's prices most see consumption falling significantly next year, compensating to some extent for the reduction in Brazilian supplies. The LCE cocoa market put in a much more pedestrian performance this year. The current three-year sequence of world supply/demand deficits is generally expected to continue for another two years at least, so stocks should continue to fall. But that has already been taken account of at present market levels, analysts say, and it will take fresh bullish developments to lift prices above the 6 1/2 -year highs seen briefly in July. At Pounds 1,116 a tonne the July peak for the second futures position was only Pounds 50 above the high seen in December 1993. And since then the price has retreated by about Pounds 180. It closed yesterday at Pounds 984 a tonne, up just Pounds 55 over the year. Producer talk of a withholding scheme similar to that operated by coffee producers does not seem to have worried buyers overmuch and prospects for renewed price gains in the new year could depend on a return of the investment fund money that was switched into the coffee market in the first quarter of this year. London white sugar futures surged to four-year highs late in 1994 as increasing supply tightness was felt in the market. In late trading yesterday the second position stood at Dollars 405.50 a tonne, up Dollars 118 overall but Dollars 9 down from the peak reached early this month. Broker C. Czarnikow said recently that sugar prices were likely to continue in a 'consolidation phase' for a while because big importers such as China and Russia would probably stay out of the market until well into next year. In its December Sugar Review, Czarnikow said: 'Although renewed strength may well emerge during the course of next year, there is now less certainty about the direction which the market might take in the short term and there is likely to be a period of consolidation.' A week earlier, however, ED &amp; F. Man, another broker, suggested that the sugar market could move higher in coming months. 'In this situation,' it said, 'even routine offtake is enough to reinforce the underlying support for prices.' The International Sugar Organisation, which represents the world's leading producers, appears to go along with Czarnikow's 'consolidation theory'. It said recently that it believed prices above 15 US cents a pound (just above the current level) would 'dry up physical demand from the price-sensitive importers which account for the lion's share of the world sugar trade'. Volatility has been one of the main features of oil prices this year, with sharp swings between the year's low of just under Dollars 12 a barrel for Brent Blend in February and a high of about Dollars 19.40 a barrel in the summer. Some traders say the presence of hedge and commodity funds in the oil markets has led to increased price volatility. Oil prices have remained relatively weak even though the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries has generally adhered to the 24.52m barrel-a-day quota first set in September 1993. The continued expansion of non-Opec production, particularly from the British and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea, was one of the main reasons why Opec's strategy during the past year failed to result in oil prices moving steadily upwards. Non-Opec production is expected to expand even further in the first half of 1995. But Opec strategists hope that faster economic growth in the main industrial countries will lead to sharply higher oil demand by the end of 1995, and the prospect of higher prices.</p>

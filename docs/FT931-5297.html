			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Close poised to pay Pounds 15m for Winterflood WINTERFLOOD Securities, the specialist smaller company marketmaker, is likely to be sold to the the merchant banking group Close Brothers for about Pounds 15m. News of the sale emerged yesterday as Union Discount, the troubled discount house group which owns Winterflood, announced that talks over a possible disposal of the entire group had been abandoned. The sale of the Union group, the oldest specialist money market operator in London, is understood to have foundered over the inability to agree a price for its troubled leasing business. The potential buyer, thought to have been rival discount house group Cater Allen, is believed to have argued that the leasing portfolio could contain further losses in the future. Union, on the other hand, claimed that leasing had become a more profitable business in the wake of the recent fall in UK interest rates. The sale of the Winterflood business to Close Brothers would help to bolster Union's balance sheet and boost its prospects as an independent company. Union's independence was thrown in doubt last year after it was forced to increase provisions against its leasing business, pushing its share price down from a high of 500p in 1990 to around 50p. Union's 1992 results, expected to be announced as early as next week, are expected to show that its core short-term money market business has improved as interest rates have fallen, in line with other discount houses. Mr Brian Winterflood, who founded the marketmaking company in 1988 to concentrate on USM and Third Market stocks, refused to comment on the identity of the potential purchaser yesterday. He said, though, his company would be 'very happy' with the new parent. 'We will not change from what we are presently doing,' he said. It is not expected that there will be any redundancies. Mr Winterflood said his company had seen an increase in turnover in trade in smaller companies' shares, particularly in the last three months. In the six months to June 30, Union Discount's equity and gilt edged marketmaking - which includes Winterfloods and Aitken Campbell &amp; Co - contributed profits of Pounds 2.7m. Mr Rod Kent, managing director of Close Brothers, could not be contacted for comment yesterday.</p>

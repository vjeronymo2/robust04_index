			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Serbs tighten grip on Sarajevo The Bosnian Serbs, in a clear warning to the west not to impose punitive measures for their refusal to sign a peace agreement, have said they will reimpose their blockade on civilian traffic in and out of Sarajevo from today. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, told the United Nations in Sarajevo that its convoys would be the only traffic allowed in and out of the Bosnian capital. The Serb threat could mean the virtual reimposition of the siege of the capital which ended with a truce in February. It is also a pointed reminder to the west of how rapidly the situation in Bosnia as a whole could deteriorate if the Serbs reverse the concessions they made earlier this year. A meeting in Geneva this weekend of the five foreign ministers involved in designing a peace plan for Bosnia is expected to hear calls, particularly from the US, for tougher action against the Serbs. However, in another serious challenge to western policy in Bosnia, General Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister, said in Belgrade that he did not want to see Nato playing a greater role in former Yugoslavia.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Boris Krivoshey] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 7 Jun -- Russia has nothing against  cooperation between Caspian states and third countries and firms  from these countries to undertake exploratory work and process  resources on their territory. Grigoriy Karasin, director of the  Russian Federation Foreign Ministry's Press and Information  Department, stated this at a briefing today in connection with  the appearance in the Russian press of articles on matters  connected with exploration for and processing of resources in  the Caspian Sea.    However, he noted that with regard to resources in the  Caspian Sea, there are extremely serious limitations on  unilateral action because of the vulnerability of its ecosystems  and the fact that issues concerning the extension of the  national jurisdiction of the states on the Caspian coast have  not been sorted out. "The danger that such action might damage  the rights or interests of other Caspian states is too great.  Foreign partners who reach agreement on activities of one kind  or another in the Caspian should take this into account,"  G.Karasin stressed.    The Russian diplomat added that efforts were already being  made now to draw up a mechanism for regional cooperation in the  Caspian. All issues relating to the use of the Caspian and its  resources would be resolved under mutually acceptable  conditions, within its framework. "We hope that such a mechanism  will be set up in the near future. Until agreement on this is  reached, unilateral actions by any Caspian state will not lead  to a change in the laws operating in the Caspian and will not be  recognized by Russia," G.Karasin said.</p>

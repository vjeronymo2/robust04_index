			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Ford gives Jaguar extra Pounds 300m FORD, the US car producer, is injecting another Pounds 300m of equity capital into Jaguar in addition to the Pounds 255m already put into the UK luxury car company, which it bought for Pounds 1.56bn in 1989. The US parent has been forced to recapitalise Jaguar in the face of the UK company's continuing heavy losses. As part of this action, it has chosen to transform about Pounds 180m of inter-company debt into equity to improve the Jaguar balance sheet. Ford has been forced to inject new equity capital into Jaguar in each of the last three years. According to Jaguar's annual report, filed at Companies House, Ford provided Pounds 120m in two tranches last year following the injection of Pounds 135m in 1991. These contributions have been eaten up by Jaguar's continuing losses. It suffered a pre-tax loss of Pounds 189.5m last year after losses of Pounds 226.1m in 1991, Pounds 66.2m in 1990 and Pounds 58.3m in 1989. The annual report discloses that the company incurred a restructuring charge of Pounds 21.4m for redundancies last year in addition to Pounds 42.5m in 1991. Jaguar's UK workforce was reduced to 6,481 at the end of 1992 from 7,520 a year earlier and 11,661 at the end of 1990. Its losses have been reduced this year as output has risen to meet a recovery in demand in the US and the UK. Its first-half pre-tax loss was reduced to Pounds 77.2m from Pounds 88.3m. Jaguar's improving fortunes in the US are expected to help increase worldwide sales this year by about 29 per cent to more than 29,000 from the 22,478 achieved last year. Sales are forecast to exceed 30,000 in 1994, despite the continuing recession in Europe. Mr Michael Dale, president of Jaguar's US subsidiary, said last week that sales in the US in 1994 could exceed 15,000 - compared with an expected 13,000 this year and 8,600 in 1992 - accounting for roughly 50 per cent of Jaguar's worldwide sales volume. Jaguar had not yet reached its break-even production level, which was now 'in the low 30,000 range', he said. Turnover last year declined by 4.9 per cent to Pounds 659.4m. Research and development spending rose to Pounds 66.2m last year, from Pounds 54.4m, as Jaguar worked on the renewal of its model range for the mid-1990s. This will be led by the launch next year of its revamped XJ6 luxury saloon. Capital spending totalled Pounds 46.2m last year, compared with Pounds 70m in 1990. The report also showed that Jaguar paid Mr Nicholas Scheele, chairman and chief executive, Pounds 144,652 in 1992 - about half the Pounds 285,082 paid to his predecessor Mr Bill Hayden in 1991.</p>

			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / International Company News: Turnround at Kugelfischer FAG Kugelfischer, the German ball-bearing group which underwent a rigorous shake-up last year, rolled back to profit in the six months to the end of June. Operating income of DM49m (Dollars 30.2m) contrasted with a loss at this level of DM109m last time. Net earnings were DM17m compared with a deficit of DM104m. The group said yesterday it expected a positive result for the full year, as long as markets did not deteriorate, and for sales to increase on a like-for-like basis. The return to the black was due largely to reduced interest payments and payroll costs. Bank debt at the end of June had been reduced to DM1bn compared with DM1.84bn, while reducing the workforce by 40 per cent had cut the wages bill by 34 per cent. Meanwhile, operations also benefited from the international economic recovery. FAG booked new orders in the review period worth DM1.44bn, an increase of 23 per cent. On July 1 it had orders on hand for almost 4 1/2 months' work. Group sales in the first half were up 1 per cent on a comparable basis, at DM1.32bn. The company has benefited from the international recovery, especially in the automotive and machinery sectors. FAG had almost been given up for lost two years ago, before Mr Kajo Neukirchen, a renowned turnround specialist, was appointed chairman of the supervisory board. His job was to oversee a shake-up involving closures, sales and massive job losses. From 30,000 at the start of 1993, when he took office, the group workforce had been cut to 15,400 at the end of June. In the interim, Mr Neukirchen has taken charge of the salvage operation at Metallgesellschaft, the German engineering group that almost collapsed late last year. As part of his plan, FAG has been split into four joint stock companies with responsibilities for automotive components, aircraft and precision bearings, trade and services.</p>

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tories beat off attack on EC role THE government last night survived a Labour attack on its discharge of Britain's presidency of the European Community, which is due to end next month. It secured a Comons majority of 50 (312-262), in favour of its policy. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, intervened in the closing stages of the debate to dismiss suggestions by Labour leaders that the summit meeting due to open in Edinburgh on December 11 could result in adverse changes to the arrangements negotiated by Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the former prime minister, to reduce Britain's contribution to the EC budget. 'We are not prepared to accept a change,' Mr Lamont insisted. Sir John Cope, paymaster general, who wound up the debate, said Britain's underlying net contribution through the public sector to the EC budget was now running at some Pounds 2bn a year. He stressed it would be much higher without the abatement negotiated by Mrs Thatcher. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, assured the House that there would be radical changes in the operation of the EC, with more decisions taken at national level, as a result of the British presidency. He praised the role of Mr John Major, the prime minister, in opening the way for a wider agreement on liberalising world trade which,coupled with the steps taken to ensure a single European market by the start of next year, would be seen as 'massive achievements'. Mr Hurd dismissed remarks by 'flustered' French politicians attacking the ineffectiveness of the British presidency and urged Labour MPs to be more careful in expressing similar sentiments. That did not deter Mr John Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, from arguing that the humiliating and total collapse of government policies in the wake of sterling's forced withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism had put Britain on the 'sideline in Europe'. He ended an appraisal of the achievements of the British presidency, based on the benchmarks set by the government itself, by awarding one mark out of 10. Labour MPs encouraged Mr Nick Budgen, the prominent Euro-sceptic Tory MP for Wolverhampton South-West when he complained that the whips had used a 'hard ball' when seeking to contain the recent revolt by Conservative backbenchers over the Maastricht treaty when the government survived by just three votes.</p>

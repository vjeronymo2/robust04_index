			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and </F> German Chancellor Helmut Kohl: "Preparing for Peace"]    [Text] Starting on 1 July this year, Germany and France  will in succession take on the presidency of the European Union  [EU]. They are conscious of their common responsibility within  the EU, in particular in this period of profound changes  throughout the continent. They intend to closely coordinate  their action during their presidencies.    Following the radical upheavals which have taken place in  Europe since 1989, the EU has a historic obligation and a common  objective to help the states of Central and East Europe regain  their place in the European family and to involve them in the  process of unification which is under way. In this way, we wish  to guarantee lasting peace and freedom in Europe.    At the Copenhagen summit in July 1993, the Twelve began a  long-term process of expanding eastward, by offering a concrete  opportunity of membership to countries which are now linked to  the EU via association or free trade agreements.    To this end, these countries must fulfil a series of  economic  and political conditions. The EU is supporting this process in  a very diversified fashion, ranging from commercial facilities  to close political dialogue, and including very substantial  technical and financial assistance. We need to be very  conscious of the fact that these countries' path toward the EU  will be long and difficult. It is all the more important to  affirm to them already that they are welcome within the EU.  This is why we are jointly suggesting that the heads of state  and government of the countries which are seeking membership be  invited once a year to a European Council, in order to discuss  questions of mutual interest with the Twelve, and soon the  Sixteen, and in this way deepen our cooperation.    With the same end in mind, at the proposal of Germany and  France, the Western European Union has agreed on a status of  associated partnership for those countries, in order to foster  rapprochement in the area of security policy.    In this way we are creating ever more numerous and closer  links between the EU and the other members of the European  family, which have, for so long, been kept outside the process  of unification. The Yugoslavian conflict has clearly  demonstrated that the peace and security of our continent are  far from being secured. The exacerbation of historical ethnic,  religious, and cultural tensions has resulted in an atrocious  war, expulsions, the growth of fanaticism, and the changing of  frontiers by force. It is our duty as Europeans to do  everything to reestablish peace in this region as soon as  possible and to avert, once and for all, every possibility of a  return to barbarism in Europe.  <H5>  With the United States and Russia </H5>   In other regions of our continent, there exist latent  tensions resulting mainly from unresolved border and minority  problems. We cannot ensure stability and peace in Europe if we  do not succeed in eliminating the causes of tension and, in this  way, forestall conflicts in an effective and lasting fashion.  In this respect the EU assumes a particular responsibility.  This is why, last December, the European Council in Brussels  approved the proposal by the French prime minister to organize a  Conference on Stability in Europe, an initiative which was  supported by President Francois Mitterrand at the June 1993  Council of Copenhagen.    This initiative is based on the observation that political  stability is an essential precondition for ensuring economic and  social progress as well as peace and freedom. What value would  the free trade and association agreements with Central and East  European countries, or indeed, their future membership of the  EU, have, if serious political crises, provoked in particular by  problems of boundaries or minorities, were to call this progress  into question?    The initiative of the Twelve in favor of a Stability Pact is  aimed at encouraging the signing of good neighborliness  agreements between all Central and East European countries. Of  course, these agreements will not settle, once and for all, all  the problems which may continue to exist between these  countries, but they should create a climate of trust and  introduce means of cooperation which make it possible to resolve  any difficulties which may arise by mutual agreement. This  principle has been the key to reconciliation and the process of  unification of West Europe since World War II. The relationship  which today unites France and Germany, long considered as  hereditary enemies, is the most striking proof of this.    The initiative of the Twelve does not seek to create an  additional institution or the draw up a new version of the  fundamental principles which we have agreed on within the  framework of the United Nations, the CSCE, or the Council of  Europe, whether these principles be the inviolability of  borders, the territorial integrity of states, or the respect of  minority rights.    Today, the essential priority is to have these principles  applied without restriction in order to effectively forestall  tensions and crises in Europe. With this initiative, the Twelve  are proposing to their Central and East European partners a  European framework for negotiating good neighborliness  agreements in a climate of trust. They are able to encourag this  movement thanks to the EU's economic and political weight.  <H5>  Political Will of the Countries </H5>   The Twelve have no intention to prescribe or impose  ready-made solutions on their partners. The success of this  project will depend on the political will of the countries  concerned. Nobody can or wants to relieve them of this  responsibility. They alone are in a position to find, while  retaining entire sovereignty, the solution which best suits them  and which at the same times serves European stability.    In our eyes, the participation of the United States and  Russia is fundamental to the success of this conference. A  close and tested partnership, such as the presence of the United  States, is and remains essential to the security of Europe  [sentence as published]. We are equally conscious that there  can be no stability and effective security in Europe without  cooperation with Russia. For this reason we wish to build a  close partnership with this country, which is a large and  powerful neighbor of the EU.    The full participation of the CSCE is equally essential to  the success of the Conference on Stability. The conference is  fundamentally based on the principles of this institution, and  its instruments must be used in full to put the agreements  reached at conference into effect. In this way the results of  this initiative will be an integral part of the CSCE process and  will give it a strong impetus.    Germany and France are resolved, with their EU partners, to  bring to fruition this first initiative undertaken within the  framework of the joint foreign and security policy. They will  do everything to contribute in this way to stability, peace, and  freedom.    Our objective is to call, in a year from now, a conference  at  which the Stability Pact will be concluded, following a process  of establishing a network of bilateral good neighborliness  agreements between the countries of Central and East Europe.  This Stability Pact will provide an occasion for Europe to  prove its determination to overcome, for good, the ancient  division of our continent, and to ensure the peoples of Europe a  peaceful future.</p>

			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Purchases and joint ventures boost CIA Group to Pounds 2.3m CIA Group, the UK's largest independent media buyer, increased interim profits by 23 per cent from Pounds 1.89m to Pounds 2.32m pre-tax in spite of a sharp increase in operating costs due to expansion. Acquisitions and joint ventures mean that the USM-traded group now operates in 13 cities across six European countries - a year ago its operations were confined to three cities in the UK. Mr Chris Ingram, chairman and chief executive, said that 1994 would mark the move from 'being a UK group with growing international business to a genuine European group'. Turnover for the six months to June 30 increased by 73 per cent to Pounds 212.3m (Pounds 122.9m), while operating costs jumped from Pounds 5.57m to Pounds 12.3m. Mr Ingram said the cost base had increased significantly 'as a result of putting in place the infrastructure for building and running a considerably larger and more complex organisation operating on a multinational basis'. In the 1994 second half and moving into 1995, the higher costs would be covered by a much larger business base, he said. Organic growth in existing businesses was 20 per cent in the first half, helped by the recovery. Earnings were 2.76p (2.77p). The interim dividend is 0.51p (0.487p).</p>

			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Employment in the US surges ahead THE US economy created more than a third of a million jobs between January and February, the biggest increase in four years and a sign that employers are finally gaining sufficient confidence to hire more workers. The unemployment rate, however, declined only 0.1 percentage points to 7.0 per cent, reflecting a large increase in the labour force last month. President Bill Clinton yesterday welcomed the figures but warned that there remained 'stark challenges ahead'. He indicated that the administration remained committed to its Dollars 30bn (Pounds 21bn) short-term fiscal stimulus, saying that it would would create 700,000 jobs this summer and send a 'profoundly important signal' to the American people. Ms Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, said: 'We're shooting for full employment.' The surge in employment far exceeded expectations on Wall Street, where most analysts had projected a gain of little more than 100,000 jobs. The dollar rose sharply in early trading to stand at DM1.6675 by midday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 15.94 to 3414.85. Non-farm payroll employment rose 365,000 to 109.2m in February, the first month that the economy has generated jobs in the numbers normally expected in a recovery from recession. However, figures for January were revised down to show a gain of only 44,000 against an initial estimate of 106,000. Two thirds of last month's increase was in service industries, with retail employment rising 131,000 to 19.3m, the biggest gain in five years. Construction employment rose 96,000 to 4.6m, reversing small declines in recent months. Manufacturing employment was flat at 18.1m. However, the Labor Department reported an increase in factory hours to the highest level since 1966. Overtime hours are at the highest level on record, suggesting that manufacturers will soon have to hire more workers. Mr Robert Reich, the secretary of labour, questioned the quality of the employment gain, noting that a large proportion of the new jobs were part-time. The jobless rate, while well below last year's peak of 7.7 per cent, was still higher than at the end of the recession nearly two years ago. Mr John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, the Wall Street securities house, said the figures pointed to 'sturdy and self-sustaining' growth and undermined fears that the economy was running into a stall after robust growth in the fourth quarter. The consensus view is that the economy will expand at an annual rate of about 3 per cent this quarter, down from nearly 5 per cent in the final quarter of last year but in line with White House projections.</p>

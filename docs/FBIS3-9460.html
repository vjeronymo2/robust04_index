According to him, the new  regulations should enable the EBRD to fulfill its mandate in the  best manner possible--that is, by assisting the reform process  in Central and East Europe.    We would like to come closer to the local private sector, to  focus on support for its development, and to be active in all of  the countries of the region, said de Larosiere. In his opinion,  the EBRD should be more involved in the capital inputs into the  enterprises, and it is also necessary to emphasize the  significance of the financial sector for the successful course  of the reforms. Support for the development, first and foremost,  of private business initiatives in the infrastructure sphere,  which is the driving force behind an economy's growth, remains a  priority.    In his speech, the president confirmed the EBRD's intention  to become capitally involved in developing the financial sector  in Central and East Europe. The bank has already confirmed its  intention to invest a total of 111 million European Currency  Units in 11 financial institutions in eight of the region's  countries. "We were asked by the management of the Czech  Komercni banka [Commercial Bank] to become involved in  purchasing some of the shares from the forthcoming issue," said  de Larosiere. However, in his opinion, it would be a greater  success for the Czech economy if the entire issue is absorbed by  the local market.    The policy of the European Union [EU] toward the countries  of  East Europe in the trade issue should be more liberal since the  EU's policy still seems too shortsighted and egoistic in this  respect. This statement was made by former British Chancellor  of the Exchequer Norman Lamont after he delivered his speech to  the European Banking Forum. Norman Lamont added that  enterprises in some postcommunist countries are frequently  supported less by the state than, for example, Italian or  Spanish enterprises, and, consequently, this issue should not  prevent these countries from being admitted into the European  Union.    In his speech to the European Banking Forum, Zdenek Drabek,  an adviser to the governor of the Czech National Bank, referred  to the similarity of the measures introduced by the East  European states in reforming the banking sector. The European  Banking Forum sessions held at midday and in the afternoon of  Tuesday [22 March] concentrated on the establishment and  activity of the East European commercial banks and the issue of  the influx of foreign capital into the transforming economies.</p>

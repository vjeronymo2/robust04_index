			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): JR East flotation leaves Nikkei with 1.4% decline STOCK PRICES lost ground as investors liquidated holdings to buy East Japan Railway shares which were floated yesterday, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue Nikkei average declined 285.73, or 1.4 per cent, to 20,023.60. Traders said overall trading was slack as investors focused on JR East shares, which were not traded until the end of the day because of a lack of sellers. The Nikkei rose to the day's high of 20,344.53 in the morning, and fell to 20,019.90 during the afternoon. Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities said share prices had declined as the rush of buy orders for JR East had clogged up the computer at the Tokyo stock exchange, making large programme buying of shares impossible. Meanwhile, small-lot selling by dealers on the final trading day for October settlements also depressed prices. Volume was 333.9m shares, against 312m. Falls overwhelmed rises by 967 to 109, with 107 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 24.13 to 1,645.31, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 3.83 to 1,295.28. Due to the lack of sellers, buyers raised their bids throughout the day for JR East, which was publicly offered in August at Y380,000. The stock finally traded at Y600,000 at the session's end. However, in spite of previous hopes that trading in JR East would boost overall activity, stock prices lost ground, led by a fall in large-capital issues. Nippon Steel, the most active stock of the day, fell Y14 to Y335 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries declined Y8 to Y683. Traders still hope that investors who had bought JR East at Y380,000 will put their profits back into the stock market. 'Profits held by individual investors who bought the stock at Y380,000 are estimated to total Y300bn to Y400bn,' said one Japanese broker. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which was sold by investors wanting to buy JR East shares, retreated Y30,000 to Y843,000. Kajima, the construction company, lost Y2 at Y859 after public prosecutors arrested the company's vice-president for allegedly bribing politicians. In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 239.38 to 21,982.02 in volume of 20.1m shares. The index dropped below the 22,000 line for the first time since July 28 on small-lot selling. Roundup MOVES in politically sensitive markets enlivened the region. NEW ZEALAND, where an election is due to be held on Saturday week, saw a 23-cent rise to NZDollars 4.23 in market leader Fletcher Challenge, and a new four-year high in the NZSE-40 index, which closed 14.9 stronger at 2,113.01. The New Zealand government has a 6.7 per cent holding in Fletcher, which recently announced moves to simplify its structure by shaving off forest and rural servicing assets into separate companies. The 3.2m shares traded in the stock accounted for a big slice of the market's NZDollars 37.5m turnover. KARACHI closed higher for the 12th consecutive session, the KSE index rising 20.73 to a 1993 peak of 1,522.17. The bullish trend reflects the victory of Ms Benazir Bhutto's PPP (Pakistan People's Party) in the October 6 elections. BOMBAY dropped as fears over a political crisis in the northern state of Kashmir undermined sentiment. The BSE index closed 40.8 lower at 2,700.3. In COLOMBO, however, foreign buying of Sri Lankan stocks took the all-share index up 14.57 to 758.93. HONG KONG's Hang Seng index rose 58 points in morning trade as bargain hunters snapped up shares, and then fell back on profit-taking before ending 23.40 ahead at 8,790.90. Brokers said smaller companies were the main focus of trading, with China-linked shares holding up well. Turnover eased from HKDollars 5.61bn to HKDollars 5.02bn. AUSTRALIA rebounded from morning lows, bargain hunters lifting the All Ordinaries index a net 8.8 to 2,055.7, after touching 2,039.9. Turnover was ADollars 310.2m. Heavyweights put in most of the recovery, BHP rising 22 cents to ADollars 17.16 and CRA 14 cents to ADollars 15.50. SEOUL saw healthy interest in electricity utility Kepco as the composite index rose 5.49 to 747.97. Kepco climbed Won600 to Won20,800, but brokers were cautious, saying that heavy institutional selling pressure was lurking at the Won21,000 level. MANILA's composite index advanced 12.35 to 2,243.55 in spite of an overnight correction in Philippine Long Distance Telephone, which dipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 61 1/2 on Wall Street. TAIWAN, where plans to ease curbs on foreign investment in the stock market were announced yesterday, fell on profit-taking, the weighted index slipping 8.92 to 4,091.17. BANGKOK got the jitters in the morning following the dismissal of Mr Sawasdi Amornvivat, the national police chief, but the SET index came back from a low of 1,135.67, down 13.87, to finish 8.74 higher on balance at 1,158.28 in moderate turnover of Bt8.21bn.</p>

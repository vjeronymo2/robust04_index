			<p>BFN     [Text] On 10 June, U.S. Commerce Department Undersecretary  Garten gave an interview to NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reporters  during his visit to Japan. On the Japan-U.S. framework talks,  Garten declared: "We are not demanding numerical targets for  market share and such." On whether the pledge to increase the  number of sales outlets in Japan for foreign automobiles is  equivalent to "numerical targets," he avoided a clear statement  by saying: "Detailed discussion on negotiations is an issue for  later," thus indicating that defining numerical targets remains  to be done. Regarding Japan's official development assistance  (ODA) projects, he remarked: "I understand that they are open to  U.S. corporations, but I would like to see some effort being  made on providing information on bidding and other complicated  mechanisms."    In praising the reopening of the framework talks as "having  gotten off to a good start," Undersecretary Garten stated he  "would like to work to reach an agreement as soon as possible."  Regarding the outlook for an agreement, however, he expressed  the view: "There is no particular time limit. We have just  begun detailed discussions, so now is not an appropriate time to  predict when we will have an agreement."    Speaking about his intention -- expressed in an interview  last week -- to demand expanded participation by U.S.  corporations in Japanese ODA projects, Undersecretary Garten  emphasized: "My statement has been a little misunderstood. I  understand that ODA projects are open to foreign corporations."  He then revealed his thinking: "What I mean is that I would  like to see some effort made on providing information on bidding  and other complicated mechanisms and to have it made easy for  U.S. corporations to participate."    The undersecretary also touched on cooperation with Japan in  multimedia and other advanced technologies in the  telecommunications field: "It will be an important topic for  future Japan-U.S. relations." Furthermore, he stated: "It  will be necessary for both our countries to lead the world in  such areas as intellectual property rights and the  standardization of machine standards.    The Clinton administration is making an effort to help U.S.  companies expand exports. Undersecretary Garten particularly  expressed the ideas of strengthening the functions of the U.S.  Export-Import Bank and backing exports by small and medium  enterprises. He pointed out 10 countries that are expected to  grow into promising export markets: South Korea, China,  Indonesia, India, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, South Africa,  Poland, and Turkey. Among those, he indicated that China and  Indonesia "will become the highest-priority countries."</p>

			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / UK Company News: RBC sells fund investment activity Royal Bank of Scotland has reached a tentative agreement to merge, Capital House Investment Management, its fund management subsidiary, with Newton Investment Management. RBS would take a one-third stake for Pounds 25m in the combined entity, writes Norma Cohen. The move creates a new institution with about Pounds 8bn under management. RBS said last spring it was holding talks with Newton, one of the most successful UK managers of institutional pension fund assets. It has about Pounds 5bn of assets under management of which Pounds 4bn are those of pension schemes. The move stunned the industry. Newton has a policy of limiting the pace of its expansion, saying it will never take on more new assets than it can successfully manage. Mr Jonathan Powell, marketing director at Newton, said the privately-held group agreed to the transaction because it would greatly expand its non-pension fund investment activities. Two-thirds of Capital House's assets are those of private clients, unit trusts and Personal Equity Plans. In addition RBS would market Newton-managed unit trusts exclusively through its 750-branch network. Under the terms RBS will transfer all of Capital Houses's share capital to Newton. It will then take a 33.16 per cent stake in the combined equity of the new company for Pounds 25m. The deal, which is expected to be concluded before November 30, allows some of the partners to be paid in long-term notes which can be exercised at a time when it will be tax advantageous for them to do so. It has also been agreed in principle that Newton will have the right to require Royal Bank to subscribe for up to Pounds 10m of cumulative redeemable preference shares.</p>

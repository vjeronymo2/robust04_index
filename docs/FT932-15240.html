			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Turkish agriculture approaches watershed - A look at a project to harness the Tigris and Euphrates for irrigation THE WORLD'S second largest single source irrigation scheme will be inaugurated by Turkey's prime minister, Suleyman Demirel, on May 22, when the large 24km Urfa tunnels are opened to take water from the Ataturk dam to the Harran plain on the border with Syria. The twin tunnels, providing water for 1.7m hectares (4.2m acres) of farmland along Turkey's border with Syria and Iraq, form part of the largest engineering undertaking in any country bordering the Mediterranean. The South-East Anatolian development, or Gap, has already aroused criticism from Turkey's downstream neighbours. It will be the task of the UK water engineer, Sir William Halcrow and Partners, which has been awarded a USDollars 12m consultancy contract, to design an irrigation system which meets the various political, economic and environmental concerns. Halcrow's findings could decide the future shape of farming in Turkey, providing a blueprint for irrigation in other parts of the country. Water management is at the heart of Turkey's attempts to harness the Tigris and Euphrates rivers for agriculture. Turkey already earns almost Dollars 3bn from farm product exports, about 20 per cent of total export earnings. Gap is expected to increase Turkey's irrigated farmland by a third, doubling wheat production and increasing cotton output more than fivefold. After going it alone for so long, Turkey is soliciting foreign advice on a number of critical aspects of the project, an indication of desire to avoid the criticism associated with other large scale public investment irrigation schemes. The French group Compagnie Nationale Bas Rhone Lanquedoc is surveying the main canal system. Alexander Gibb, the UK consultant, has a subcontract to look at road infrastructure. Tubitak, the Turkish science research institute, is studying agricultural credit policy. The German company AFC is looking at market strategy. At Cukurova university, scientists are making studies of everything from the reproductive habits of bees - vital for future pollination purposes in such a vast monoculture crop scheme - to the region's soils. Halcrow's project will focus on issues of land ownership, land quality, topography, climate, water availability and the social, religious and economic attitudes of farmers in the region. It will advise on the teaching of extension skills for farmers unused to modern farm methods, on cost recovery and conservation technologies for downstream users. Water is perhaps the Middle East's most vital resource and control of both the Euphrates and the Tigris would make Turkey a vital player in settlement of the region's water disputes in any future Arab-Israeli negotiation. Foreign hydrologists have long argued for more prudent management. There are many obstacles. Today Turkish farmers are charged for their water according not to volume used but to the quality of the land being irrigated  -the poorer the soils the cheaper the water. According to Mr Hurman Ocakli, deputy president of the Gap authority, 'the farmers use as much water as they want. It is not even calculated.' Repayment of loans in Turkey's south east region is 30-40 per cent, compared with a national figure of 75-80 per cent for agricultural credits. Many agronomists believe there will have to be widescale land reform, not so much for equity as efficiency. There is little prospect of increasing scale economies in a region where according to one calculation, more than a quarter of the cultivated land is owned by less than 1 per cent of the region's farmers. Equally striking is that 61 per cent of farmers own less than five hectares of land. The environmental challenge is even more urgent. No more than 30 per cent of the planned 1.7m hectares is likely to use the more expensive drip or pressurised hose irrigation, the rest being open furrow system. Western officials say there is a new urgency as farmers prepare to irrigate the first 40,000 hectares on the Harran plain, close to the Syrian border. The land use issue is political at a time of rising violence in Kurdish speaking areas. According to one senior official, the explicit aim of the Gap project is to 'reduce the rural population,' through land consolidation and the provision of alternative industry in urban areas. Many officials believe the jobs created by the Gap will help accelerate this process. In the long run, Ankara sees the demographic cards stacked in its favour, and believes that this, more than any olive branch of reform, is the best way to undermine the power base of the Kurdish guerrillas.</p>

This will strengthen the company's capital base and boost its solvency margin by four points. This marked the largest sterling denominated issue for a UK company, according to lead managers, Hoare Govett. GA announced last month that it was seeking permission to raise a total of Pounds 300m in preference shares, when announcing a sharp improvement in pre-tax profit for the first half of 1992. The issue was priced at 2.5 percentage points over the UK government gilt-edged stock, 9 per cent Treasury 2008. The net dividend was fixed at 8 7/8 per cent, representing an issue yield of 11.734 per cent. Co-lead managers were Salomon Brothers International and Henry Schroder Wagg. Mr David Barker, a director of Hoare Govett Corporate Finance, said the issue was 'satisfactory despite the current volatility of the markets.' Mr Barry Holder, general manager finance, said the issue 'allows us to write more business at a time when the market is becoming more profitable '. Commercial Union raised Pounds 100m via a preference issue in May. See Lex</p>

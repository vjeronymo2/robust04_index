			<p>BFN     [Text] Ulundi April 20 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP]  President Mangosuthu Buthelezi said on Wednesday [20 April] he  would accept the results of South Africa's first all-race  election next week if they were endorsed by the international  community.    Addressing a short media conference in Ulundi after his  first  election rally in the kwaZulu capital, Mr Buthelezi said: "One  must accept that whatever the international monitors say will be  it -- whatever one's feelings may be."    On the IFP's election candidate lists, Mr Buthelezi said  these were still being drafted. He however "assumed" he would  head the party list for the National Assembly. "As national  leader of the party I have to be on the national list. One  can't appear on both," he said in response to a question on  whether he was eyeing the kwaZulu Natal premiership position.    The IFP president was at pains to point out that his party  had decided to contest the poll just 24 hours earlier and was  still in the process of preparing its nomination lists.</p>

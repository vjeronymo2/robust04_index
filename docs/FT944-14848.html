			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Manila sets out foreign bank rules Foreign banks wishing to start up in the Philippines under next year's liberalisation will need capital of only 210m pesos (Pounds 5m), but must come from countries offering reciprocal rights of establishment to Philippine institutions, guidelines published by the Monetary Board say. Thirty-one foreign banks have expressed interest in setting up shop, following the passage of legislation opening up the banking sector for the first time in 46 years. The change is expected to intensify competition in the financial sector. Only 10 banks will be allowed to open full-service branches, although others may acquire up to 60 per cent of existing banks, including those under receivership or liquidation. Mr Gabriel Singson, head of the central bank and its policy-setting Monetary Board, says the selection should be completed in early 1995. Six of the 10 banks will be selected by the board, while the other four will be picked by the Philippine president. The newly issued rules limit the selection to the top five banks in their home countries. They can open up to three branches in any location, and another three in areas to be designated by the Monetary Board. Foreign banks seeking the right to engage in securities businesses will need total capital of at least 1.5bn pesos, the same as domestic banks. Four foreign banks already operating in the Philippines, Bank of America, Citibank, Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and Standard Chartered, were established before overseas involvement was banned. Bankers say Manila has begun to offer more sophisticated services since removal of foreign exchange controls on current-account transactions and the easing of rules on bank branching in 1993.</p>

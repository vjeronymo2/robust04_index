"In 1988 the amount of enterprises losing money was about 10  percent. Now with the new system of accounting, more than two-  thirds of the enterprises have both clear and hidden losses,"  the CHINA BUSINESS TIMES reported.    "The state economy while taking up 70 percent of current  loans and more than 70 percent of fixed asset investments only  account for 20 to 30 percent of the country's gross production  value and make up only 42 percent of the national economy," the  report said.    "The reform of state-run enterprises is a main battle front  in this year's comprehensive reform program which will aim at  attacking issues dealing with property rights," delegates were  reported as saying at a Shenzhen meeting.    The meeting was being held to commemorate paramount leader  Deng Xiaoping's famous "southern tour" in 1992, which spurred  China's economy to 13 percent growth rates over the last two  years.    Yang Qi of the Research Committee under the State Commission  for the Restructuring of the Economy, called on every level of  government to quickly auction off small state-run enterprises or  implement shareholding or public ownership reforms, the report  said.    Yang also called on medium-sized state-run enterprises to  quickly change into a system of mixed ownership, by attracting  diverse funds through all channels, while some medium and large  enterprises must become standard corporations, it said.    Wang Jue of the Central Party School said state-run  enterprises in urban areas must change into a mixed ownership  system and principal property rights should be diversified.    Chinese leaders have called 1994 an important year in  reforming the centrally planned economy.    The reform of state-run enterprises, which could mean taking  away cradle-to-grave benefits and laying off parts of a huge  work force, seems to be an almost impossible task.</p>

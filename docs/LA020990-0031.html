			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UCLA SHOWS IT CAN WIN IN ARIZONA;  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL: MARTIN IN CONTROL AS BRUINS JUMP TO EARLY LEAD OVER ARIZONA  STATE AND SCORE 80-72 VICTORY.  </P> <P> It was just 12 months ago that UCLA rode confidently into the desert, only to  be ambushed twice in three days.  </P> <P> Swept by Arizona State and Arizona on a two-game trip, the Bruins were shot  right out of the Pacific 10 Conference race.  </P> <P> It won't happen this year.  </P> <P> A more cautious band of Bruins made sure of that Thursday night by overpowering  Arizona State, 80-72, in front of 10,994 -- the largest crowd in seven years to  watch the rejuvenated Sun Devils play an opponent other than Arizona in the  University Activity Center.  </P> <P> Only mildly challenged after opening a 14-point lead in the first nine minutes,  the Bruins (16-4 overall, 9-2 in the Pac-10) remained a game behind conference  leader Oregon State.  </P> <P> The next stop is Tucson, where Saturday on national television the Bruins will  take aim at the Wildcats' 43-game home winning streak.  </P> <P> "By us winning this game, we'll go into Arizona with a lot more confidence,"  point guard Darrick Martin said. "We really want to break that streak over  there. I think it would be right for us to do it because Sean Elliott broke  that record against us last year."  </P> <P> In UCLA's 102-64 loss at Arizona last February, Elliott surpassed former Bruin  Lew Alcindor as the Pac-10's all-time leading scorer.  </P> <P> The Bruins faced nobody of that caliber against ASU, but ASU forward Alex  Austin, who burned the Bruins for 31 points last month, drew as much defensive  attention. Gerald Madkins and Mitchell Butler harassed him into six-for-20  shooting and limited him to 12 points.  </P> <P> Austin missed all nine of his three-point shots.  </P> <P> "We made a statement defensively," Coach Jim Harrick said.  </P> <P> Arizona State (12-9, 5-7) made only 42.9% of its shots. Austin's brother,  Isaac, had 20 points and 14 rebounds for the Sun Devils.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, UCLA made 52.7%.  </P> <P> Don MacLean had 23 points and 10 rebounds for the Bruins, Tracy Murray scored  17 points, Trevor Wilson had 15 points and nine rebounds and Martin,  orchestrating from the point, had 17 points and eight assists.  </P> <P> "Darrick Martin played a strong game, controlling the action and the tempo,"  Harrick said. "He got us some layups, found guys open."  </P> <P> He has done so quite regularly in the last three weeks.  </P> <P> Said Harrick: "Since the Stanford game, he's just said, 'Hey, this is my team.  I'm going to direct it. No one can yell at me. No one can take me out of the  game -- (not) players, coaches, officials. I'm going to do what I know I can  do. I'm going to get MacLean and Wilson and Murray the ball. I'm going to step  up and run the fast break with great proficiency.' "  </P> <P> Martin, asked to fill the void left by the graduation last spring of Pooh  Richardson, wasn't always so forceful, but he's learning.  </P> <P> "With each game, I'm getting more and more comfortable," he said. "I think the  most important thing is, I have the respect of my teammates. If I have that, it  makes stepping forward that much easier."  </P> <P> And if Martin steps forward, UCLA is that much better.  </P> <P> UCLA rolled to a 22-8 lead, making 10 of its first 16 shots while Arizona State  missed 10 of its first 13.  </P> <P> "We wanted to come in here and make a statement and show everybody that we're a  good team and that we can win on the road," Harrick said of the Bruins, who  lost three of the previous four times they ventured outside of Westwood. "Now  we've got to go and prove it again."  </P> <P> Bruin Notes  </P> <P> Frank McIntyre, supervisor of basketball officials for the Pac-10, reviewed  videotape this week of the UCLA-USC game Feb. 1 and said of Harold Miner's  phantom three-point basket: "I don't know how in God's name we missed it. I  don't know if it was just a moment where they, I don't know, blacked out or  something." With 3:11 left in a game won by USC, 76-75, officials incorrectly  gave USC's Miner three points for a shot that should have counted for two.  McIntyre phoned UCLA Coach Jim Harrick this week and apologized for the error.  "It was a bad miss on our part," McIntyre said.  </P></p>

			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / MPs renew attack on Bank's role RENEWED demands were made in the Commons yesterday for the resignation of Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the governor of the Bank of England, for failing to act early enough against Bank of Credit and Commerce International. During a five-hour debate on Lord Justice Bingham's report on the BCCI affair MPs on both sides of the House protested that Mr Leigh-Pemberton, by continuing in office, had not accepted responsibility for the inadequacies revealed in the Bank's discharge of its supervisory role. Mr Leigh-Pemberton was condemned by Mr Alistair Darling, from the Labour front bench, and by Mr Alan Beith, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman. Mr Terence Higgins, Conservative MP for Worthing and a former chairman of the Commons Treasury select committee, also emphasised that there had been 'a serious failure' in the regulatory mechanism operated by the Bank. Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, dismissed demands for Mr Leigh-Pemberton's resignation, insisting that the governor had behaved 'in a wholly proper manner'. He said Mr Leigh-Pemberton had demonstrated that measures had been taken to meet the criticisms made in the Bingham report. Mr Nelson again refused to accept that the government should take responsibility for compensating depositors with BCCI and staff because the Bank had not closed it before July last year. While the Bingham report criticised the timing of the Bank's decision to force BCCI to cease trading, it had not found negligence. Mr Nelson reminded the Bank's critics that some BCCI depositors would have preferred it to continue trading after July. He said the Bank's 'prime responsibility' was to protect depositors and that this would not have been achieved by 'premature foreclosure'. Mr Darling said BCCI had regarded the Bank as a 'soft touch - and I have to say indeed it was'. He argued that either Mr Leigh-Pemberton should have accepted the consequences and resigned, or Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, should have told him to do so. Mr Darling accepted that Mr Leigh-Pemberton might well have asked Mr Lamont why he had not resigned over sterling's devaluation following its departure from the European exchange rate mechanism on Black Wednesday. Problems were arising because of the failure of anyone in the government to accept responsibility for their actions. Mr Darling added that this failure was 'debasing public life'. He claimed that if the same people responsible for the regulatory functions of the Bank were to continue in their posts, the question bound to be asked was: 'When will it happen again?' He said that those who had suffered losses believed they were entitled to compensation because Mr Lamont stated in July last year that he would be prepared to consider it if the Bingham report showed that 'blame' attached to the Bank. Referring to Mr Nelson's emphasis on the fact that there had been no finding of negligence, Mr Darling said: 'I challenge anyone to say that the Bingham report says no blame attaches to the Bank of England.' Mr Nelson rejected calls from both sides of the House to end the Bank's dual responsibilities for supervising the banking sector and for the management of the government's monetary policy. He said that the separation of the two roles would involve a great deal of administrative upheaval and loss of continuity.</p>

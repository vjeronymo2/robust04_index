The Department's 1989 ``Report to the Congress on U.S. Crude Oil Exports,'' (pp. IV&hyph;4&hyph;IV&hyph;11) concluded that opportunities to export California heavy crude generally consist of spot market rather than year-round export activity. The report found that opportunities to export California heavy crude oil occur intermittently and randomly throughout the year when the price of these oils are low and the price of Pacific Rim substitutes are high. The Department's recent experience monitoring licensed export volumes strongly supports this position. The Department recognized the need, therefore, to develop licensing procedures permitting firms to take advantage of brief windows of opportunity and to conduct spot market export transactions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1989 Commerce Report also identified numerous potential participants in such a market with a wide range of economic strengths and capabilities. The study found that allowing limited exports of California heavy crude oil would enable some firms (e.g., the independent producers) to expand their crude oil marketing opportunities, to maintain their existing oil production, and to earn additional revenue to reinvest in exploring for new domestic oil reserves.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department also recognized that having only one applicant could reduce the effectiveness of the export program. For example, an exporter could, in a licensing program without time limits, apply for and obtain an export license for the entire 25 MB/D per day for a one year period. If, however, the firm did not export the oil because of some problem with the transaction, the license would never be used. This would limit the number of potential exporters, deny commercial opportunities to other participants, and frustrate the intent of the President's export initiative. This concern argued for limiting the term of an export license to insure that the licensee used the license and exported the oil, or that the volume of oil quickly became available to other interested applicants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There was also a need to assure that licenses issued to exporters would be in commercially viable volumes since the total volume initially authorized for export is low_9.125 million barrels annually. It would be difficult to achieve economically viable shipments if the Department were to issue numerous licenses for small volumes (e.g., 100,000 barrels). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

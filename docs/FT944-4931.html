			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Conditional consent for Pounds 92m DMGT acquisition Industry minister Mr Tim Eggar yesterday gave conditional consent for the Daily Mail and General Trust to acquire T Bailey Forman, publisher of the Nottingham Evening Post, for Pounds 92m. In October the Monopolies &amp; Mergers Commission unanimously opposed the acquisition on the grounds that it would give DMGT, publisher of the Daily Mail, too high a concentration of newspapers in the East Midlands. In order to be able to go ahead with the acquisition DMGT has to agree to a number of conditions: to create a new editorial board which will be responsible for maintaining editorial independence at the Nottingham Evening Post; to sell the Long Eaton Advertiser and Stapleford and Sandiacre News and not re-enter the weekly paid-for newspaper market in the East Midlands; to refrain from launching a regional edition of the Daily Mail in the area. In addition, there will be a general obligation to avoid acting in a way that prevents, distorts or restricts competition in the newspaper market in the area, including advertising. DMGT A shares rose 3p to 988p on the news. Midland Independent Newspapers, publisher of the Birmingham Post and Mail, asked the government to block the deal and said the only way to address concerns about the acquisition was for DMGT to sell daily titles in the region.</p>

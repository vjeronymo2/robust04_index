			<p>BFN     [Text] Datuk Mohamed Noh Rajab, parliamentary secretary to  the Ministry of Land and Cooperatives Development, opened the  24th meeting of the Indonesia-Malaysia Joint Technical Committee  on Demarcation and Survey in Langkawi today.    Following the meeting he told newsmen that the  Indonesia-Malaysia common border problem is expected to be  completely settled within a period of six years. He said that  several areas along the common border, which are difficult for  the surveyors to identify, will be completely demarcated by the  year 2000. This is possible through close cooperation between  the two countries. Last year, the duration for the demarcation  and survey work along the common border was increased to seven  months annually instead of three months as it was in the past.  He said that efforts to settle the problem have to be  intensified because even though the joint demarcation project  was launched 19 years ago, only 27 percent of the East  Kalimatan-Sabah boundary line and 35 percent of the West  Kalimantan-Sarawak border have been surveyed and demarcated.</p>

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Haunted by spectre of inflation: Despite the US Treasury's cheerfulness, financial markets fear further interest rate rises Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, thinks it is the best of times to hold his job. 'I'd say that the economic numbers are the best I've seen in 20 years. You see low inflation, good sustained growth in the economy, and major creation of jobs,' he said this week. But the economic statistics that Mr Bentsen finds so encouraging have failed to bring political benefits to the Clinton administration in the battle over next month's mid-term elections. They have also spread alarm on Wall Street that the US economy may still be growing faster than can be sustained without sparking inflation. Bond investors are now convinced that the Federal Reserve needs to raise short-term interest rates in a hurry to keep inflation from breaking out. This week they pushed long-term interest rates above 8 per cent for the first time in two and a half years, and the dollar fell to its lowest level against the yen since the second world war. New statistics published a week ago suggested that the 1 3/4 percentage points by which the Fed has already raised interest rates over the last eight months have failed to take the steam out of even the most rate-sensitive sector, housing construction. In July, when Mr Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, delivered his half-yearly testimony on monetary policy to Congress, the accepted economic wisdom - broadly shared by the Fed, the administration and a consensus of private sector forecasters - was that the economy would have a 'soft landing'. At that time, the economy had already begun to slow down from the unsustainably high 4.1 per cent annualised growth rate of the second quarter this year. Even without further tightening of monetary policy by the Fed, the economy was thought to be moving into a 'glide path' of steady growth - between 2 1/4 and 2 3/4 per cent a year - before inflationary pressures had been given a chance to build up. The problem with the soft landing scenario is that policymakers have rarely been able to achieve it in the past. Even if economists think it is a plausible outcome, it is not one that investors are ready to bet on. 'The soft landing story has a better shot this time than at any time in the last 40 years, but it will take more than economic projections to convince the financial markets of the scenario in an investment sense,' said Mr Allen Sinai, chief global economist with investment bank Lehman Brothers in New York. Pessimists say the signals suggest the economy is running full steam ahead, close to or past the point at which pressure starts to build up on prices. September's housing starts, for example, were 4.4 per cent up on August. More significant is last month's fall in the unemployment rate to 5.9 per cent. There are doubts about the reliability of the unemployment statistics, because the Department of Labor changed its method of calculation at the start of this year. Nevertheless, the unemployment level is now at or below the 'natural rate' at which most members of the Federal Open Markets Committee, the Fed's policy-setting body, believe the real slack in the labour market has been absorbed. Labour shortages and pressure for higher wages have already shown up in a few sectors. US industry, meanwhile, was operating in September at 84.6 per cent of its capacity, according to the Fed's calculations. That is a shade lower than in August, but still close to the peaks reached in early 1989, before recession set in. It is also above - perhaps by more than 2 1/2 percentage points - the rate at which some economists argue production bottlenecks will start to push up manufacturers' prices. Growth in gross domestic product in the third quarter is due to be announced by the Commerce Department tomorrow. The market consensus forecast, according to MMS International, the financial information company, is for 2.8 per cent annualised growth, a considerable slowdown from the second quarter's 4.1 per cent pace. Estimates have been edging up steadily over the last two weeks, and the financial markets are already worried about the possibility that growth has once again started to accelerate in the fourth quarter. 'If the weak quarters are 3 per cent and the strong quarters are over 4 per cent, then the trend is up in the 3 1/2 per cent range, which is above what the Fed would like to see,' said Mr James O'Sullivan, an economist with bankers JP Morgan in New York. Despite the evidence of overheating, all the government's price indices show inflation is still under control. Consumer prices rose by 0.2 per cent in September for a year-on-year inflation rate of 3.0 per cent, with core inflation (excluding volatile food and energy prices) also rising 0.2 per cent. At the wholesale level, too, core producer price inflation reached only 1.9 per cent year-on-year in September. Employment cost statistics from the Labor Department show no sign of acceleration in wage inflation. Wages and salaries have risen by just 2.9 per cent over the past year, the department reported this week, and wage increases in important collective bargaining agreements signed in private industry during the past three months have averaged only 1.9 per cent a year. But the financial markets tend to dismiss such inflation yardsticks as backward-looking measurements. They believe the Fed is 'behind the curve' in its efforts to choke off inflation before it picks up, and will be compelled to raise interest rates by at least half a percentage point at the next meeting of the FOMC on November 15 - and probably by as much again before the end of the year. Not all the members of the FOMC share this view. Mr Alan Blinder, the Fed's vice-chairman, argued this week that, although the economy was showing fewer signs of deceleration than he would have thought a few months ago, it had to be remembered that monetary policy works with time lags. 'I think it probably is a fair interpretation of recent movements in the bond market that there are a number of people that trade bonds for a living that are in the 'behind the curve' school . . . I'm not convinced that they are right,' Mr Blinder said. But other members of the FOMC are more impatient. Mr Alfred Broaddus, president of the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank, had wanted the Fed to raise rates at its July meeting instead of delaying its most recent move until August. Since then, he has sternly warned that it is not good enough for the Fed to accept a 3 per cent inflation rate. One reason why the Fed's five interest rate increases so far this year have failed to take the steam even out of sectors sensitive to interest rates, such as housing, is a steady loosening of bank credit. Banks have made credit easier to obtain and have narrowed their lending margins, taking some of the sting out of the Fed's actions. This is a mirror image of the recession of 1991 and 1992, when a 'credit crunch' caused by banks' tight lending policies reduced the impact of the Fed's efforts to stimulate the economy through lower interest rates. Then, the Fed was forced to cut further than it might otherwise have done. This time, the Fed may have to raise rates further than it might otherwise have done to offset these easy credit conditions - leading Mr Greenspan and other FOMC members to issue a stream of warnings in recent weeks about looser loan standards. 'Now the chairman is worrying in public that banks are becoming overly lax in credit standards,' commented Mr John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, the securities firm. 'By analogy with his earlier action, it sounds as if he is setting the stage for more aggressive tightening.' For the Clinton administration, there is little room to quarrel with the Fed over another increase in interest rates. 'We share the same objectives as the Fed of low inflation and long-term economic growth,' said Mr Bentsen. Administration economists are even more convinced than the Fed that inflation is well under control. They argue that heavy investment in business equipment this year will raise the economy's capacity next year and ease fears of bottlenecks. But even congressional Democrats, who complained earlier in the year that the Fed was trying to kill off the recovery, say that, because of the evidence that the recovery remains strong, they are unlikely to object to a November increase. No one in the administration, after all, wants to see the kind of rapid growth that would inevitably be followed by harsh Fed tightening and a recession, just in time for the 1996 presidential election.</p>

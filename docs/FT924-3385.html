			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / International Company News: Canadian paper group to go private THE Tribune Company of Chicago, is taking Quebec &amp; Ontario Paper, its fully-owned Canadian pulp and timber subsidiary, public with a CDollars 125m (USDollars 98m) share offer. Tribune, which has owned the company for 80 years, will retain about two-thirds control. Q&amp;O, which has annual capacity of 815,000 tons metric of newsprint at its Quebec &amp; Ontario mills, will change its name to Quno Corp. Q&amp;O lost CDollars 54m on sales of CDollars 320m in the first nine months of 1992, against a profit of CDollars 4.9m on sales CDollars 370m a year earlier. Prices for newsprint ran at all-time lows after inflation, but are expected to improve sharply in 1993-94 with US economic recovery. Q&amp;O is a leader in recycling technology for newsprint production and the Chicago Tribune will remain a large customer. Wood Gundy heads the underwriting group for the public offer and will announce the price shortly.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel  appeared before the judges in Karlsruhe today, and now he is in  front of our cameras. Welcome to the Mittagsmagazin, Herr  Kinkel. Are lawyers getting involved in politics again? Or, to  rephrase that question, does the Bundestag need such a supreme  lawgiver?    [Kinkel] We would have preferred it if the Bundestag had  made  the necessary decision, and I have pressed the Social Democratic  Party [SPD] on this again and again. Unfortunately, the SPD  blocked the decision. We need it; the coalition proposed a  draft amendment to the Basic Law, but we need a two-thirds  majority and we did not get it. That is why we had to come here.    [Announcer] What argument did you make to the judges? You  are caught in the middle, so to speak: the government you belong  to on the one hand, and the Free Democratic Party [FDP], which  wants something slightly different, on the other.    [Kinkel] I am not caught in the middle at all, because  politically it was clear between all of us that we want these  three missions to go ahead. It was only with the AWACS mission  [German personnel would crew AWACS reconnaissance aircraft over  Bosnia] that the FDP parliamentary group had some doubts about  whether Article 87A (2) or Article 24 of the Basic Law is the  legal basis for this. That is the subject of the dispute here,  and with such a difficult legal position it will be necessary,  appropriate, and also possible to turn to the Constitutional  Court. After all, that is what it is there for.    But this morning I argued that we urgently need this  amendment to the Basic Law, a ruling by the Constitutional  Court, now -- because we could not reach such a ruling in the  Bundestag -- so that we can become capable of action in foreign  policy. The chancellor and I are the ones who suffer almost  daily from this situation because our friends and partners do  not understand why, after unification, we are still to a certain  extent in the spectators' gallery and to an extent incapable of  action. We must come on down, we must be able to help remove  violations of human rights and alleviate the direst need in this  world. It was not for nothing this morning that I pointed out  that 80,000 UN soldiers from 68 countries are carrying out 16  missions all over the world. Germany cannot go its own way. It  must get involved.    [Announcer] Herr Kinkel, you also want the Bundestag to make  majority decisions. Do you believe agreements would be reached  then, for the discussion of this topic has been going on for a  very long time?    [Kinkel] We put forward a coalition draft proposal, which  states that the German lower house should decide on any future  mission. I am convinced that this would be the right thing. As  regards the issue of majority decisions, this proposal says  there should be a simple majority on peacemaking and  peacekeeping measures. We hope we will soon hear what the  Federal Constitutional Court has to say on this.    [Announcer] What should the Bundeswehr be allowed to do  then,  quite specifically, without drawing down the anger of the  world--not too much and not too little?    [Kinkel] For the time being, the Bundeswehr's prime task  will  be defense. But the world has changed. We need peacekeeping  and peacemaking measures--blue helmet missions. In isolated,  exceptional cases we will also need to be involved in  peacemaking measures because there are situations--and that is  the way things are--which unfortunately require the use of force  as the ultimate resort to end them. The Bundeswehr should be  able to get involved in the future just as other armies in the  world do. Remember what happened in Rwanda last week. It was  strange that we had to give so much thought to whether we could  possibly bring out our own people, the 11 personnel of Deutsche  Welle who were trapped there. That is absurd. It cannot stay  that way; we must become capable of action.    [Announcer] Herr Kohl has said German soldiers should never  go where German troops have been in the past. Defense Minister  Ruehe does not take quite such a narrow view. What is your  position? With whom would you tend to agree?    [Kinkel] The chancellor is not talking in general terms, but  specifically about Yugoslavia. I agree with him completely that,  because of the historical situation, we would not achieve a  Bundestag majority for the deployment of German troops there,  even if we were constitutionally able to do so. This is an  opinion I share.    [Announcer] You are saying there should be no combat  deployments. But should it not be possible to sanction legally  what is already being done in practice? The Americans, who shot  down four military jets over Bosnia, were directed toward their  target by German servicemen. Wasn't that a combat mission?    [Kinkel] That is the legal question I mentioned earlier, the  matter of AWACS missions. It is true that a German was involved  in operating the AWACS aircraft's flight guidance system. But  the Constitutional Court permitted this, so to speak, through a  temporary order, and this is what we want to see examined here.  As regards AWACS deployment, the FDP's legal position differs  from that of the Christian Democratic Union and Christian Social  Union. This is why we need clarification.    [Announcer] We should also discuss the current situation in  Bosnia, Herr Kinkel. Bill Clinton is conducting defense policy  discussions as we speak. He has said that he might alter his  policy on Bosnia slightly, and he said this morning that he is  looking for recommendations. What would you recommend or advise  him to do?    [Kinkel] As I repeated yesterday in Luxembourg, and I shall  say it in Luxembourg again this evening, and yet again when I go  to the United States the day after tomorrow, we are not the ones  to be giving advice because our constitutional situation means  we cannot become involved. You see, the main problem is simply  that the situation could be resolved only by means of combat  troops being deployed on the ground. None of the countries who  are legally and actually capable of this are willing to do so,  and I appreciate their reservations.    Whenever someone here in Germany says something has to be  done and we have to get involved militarily, I ask whether the  Germans are willing to send their sons there. Until now, if I  have gauged the public mood accurately, people are not greatly  in favor of this, even if our constitution permitted it. This  is why we are not the ones to be giving advice.    By the way, just imagine, the French have 6,000 men on the  ground, the British over 2,000; the Danish, the Belgians, the  Dutch--all of them have troops there. And of course they want  to ensure that these troops are not endangered by bombing  missions. Gorazde has a specific situation: We have 60,000  encircled Muslims as well as UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force]  people who are still there. You can imagine that air strikes  would be extremely dangerous. The Americans have started  looking at new options with the United Nations and NATO. Let's  wait and see what happens.    [Announcer] I think there is still plenty more talking to be  done. Many thanks, Herr Kinkel.</p>

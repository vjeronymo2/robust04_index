			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Trimoco forecasts interim profit TRIMOCO, the motor group fighting a Pounds 25.9m bid from its rival Hartwell, has accused its challenger of reneging on an agreement to reduce its stake in the company. It has also forecast that it would make a pre-tax profit of not less than Pounds 1.2m for the six months to September 30, compared with a Pounds 250,000 loss, and said that the total 1992-93 dividend would be maintained at 1p. Hartwell is owned by the Jameel family, and the cash bid of 17 1/2 p a share was triggered when the Jameel interest in Trimoco rose from 29.8 to 39.4 per cent after the conversion of loan stock. The target's share price closed at 18 1/2 p yesterday. Mr Roger Smith, Trimoco's chairman, said that Mr John Wei, Hartwell's chairman and chief executive, and Mr Mahmoud Abdulla were both invited on to Trimoco's board in January this year when Hartwell's stake stood at 23.5 per cent. In Trimoco's defence document, published yesterday, Mr Smith says that the board appointments were made on the basis that 'the Jameel Group would reduce its shareholding in the company'. He said the background to the discussions included Ford of Britain's dealership rules. These say that if one group holds more than a 10 per cent stake in another, Ford looks at the combined number of dealerships to see whether the maximum of eight is being exceeded. The total for these two groups is 12. Mr Wei said that although discussions had taken place, there was no agreement and called on Trimoco to prove that there was one. He said the bid was a technical one, complying with the Takeover Code - which had also set the price. Ford said its agreement with Hartwell was the same as with every other franchisee. As Hartwell had a stake of more than 10 per cent in Trimoco, it would expect it to shed either dealerships or shares to bring it down below one or other of the limits. Hartwell's defence document also said the bid price was at a 20 per cent discount to net asset value and that it had a pension surplus of Pounds 8.8m, equivalent to 6p a share. The bid undervalued the company, contained no premium for control and would deny shareholders the benefit of Trimoco's future performance.</p>

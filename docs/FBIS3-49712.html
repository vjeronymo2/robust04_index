He was referring to the recommendation made by the Council  of  Europe (CE) that every citizen be obliged to master the language  of the country he lives in. Slobodnik said he did not rule out  that the Education Ministry would issue a decree stipulating  that Slovak could be taught only by Slovak teachers at ethnic  Hungarian schools. Only this would guarantee that ethnic  Hungarians would master the Slovak language, he added.    Slobodnik said that Slovakia "had no reason to feel ashamed  of its policy towards ethnic minorities. Quite the opposite."  There is a comprehensive network of primary and secondary  education with Hungarian as a teaching language, heavily  subsidized by the state, Slobodnik stated.    The Slovaks and Hungarians living in Slovakia are absolutely  equal, he said, pointing to the fact that last year 26 Hungarian  periodicals of all sorts, funded by the state, were published in  Slovakia. The state also subsidizes two Hungarian regional  theaters and 12 publishing houses, he added. The Culture  Ministry neither influences the repertory of the theaters, nor  does it interfere with the published papers and books, although  "it is often not satisfied with them," he said.    "The cultural autonomy of the ethnic Hungarians actually  exists, although some people do not want to admit it," Slobodnik  stated.    Slovakia has assumed a model approach towards ethnic  minorities, not only with respect to culture, Slobodnik claimed.  Many ethnic Hungarians bear this in mind, and do not associate  themselves with the demands of their so-called political  representatives for a province. "They keep in mind that their  economic position in Slovakia is more advantageous than would be  possible in Hungary," Slobodnik stated.</p>

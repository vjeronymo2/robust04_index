At the meeting, the officials  mentioned the reversion of Yomitan auxiliary airfield and said:  "We will study the possibility of its return." It is the first  positive comment U.S. officials have shown regarding return of  Yomitan auxiliary airfield.    The remarks came from Assistant Secretary of State for East  Asian and Pacific Affairs Winston Lord and Assistant Secretary  of Defense for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Ross [name as  received] following a request from Director General Yoneyama for  a response on three pending matters -- return of Naha Naval  Port, return of Yomitan airfield, and the suspension of  live-shell firing exercises over prefectural highway 104.    Yoneyama said: "It is the wish of the prefectural people to  settle these issues."    According to the DFA, until now the United States has only  mentioned the possibility of moving the parachute training which  is currently carried out at Yomitan auxiliary airfield. It has  never before hinted at the return of the airfield, instead  arguing that "it also acts as a radio wave impact area for both  Torii and Sobe communications stations which are located near  the auxiliary airfield."    The United States has said that parachuting training could  be  held at other sites, but has maintained that "the return of the  auxiliary airfield itself is difficult."    At the 28 February meeting, however, the U.S. officials  said:  "We would like to study the possibility of returning the  airfield once we have moved parachute training to another area."  They reportedly showed their understanding of the feelings of  the prefectural people toward U.S. military bases on Okinawa.  It is also said they promised to exert efforts to cooperate  with the Japanese Government to settle other issues as well.    The DFA is taking a positive view of the remarks by the U.S.  officials, saying: "It is a major advance that U.S. officials  took positive line on the return of Yomitan auxiliary airfield."    The agency hopes Director General Yoneyama will continue his  meetings with high-level U.S. officials.    He is due to arrive in Las Vegas on 1 March and visit San  Diego on 2 March to make inspection tours of military bases.  The bases include Nellis Air Force Base, which supervises night  landing practices held in Japan; North Island Naval Base; and  Miramar Naval Base. He is scheduled to meet base commanders and  other officials.</p>

The meeting will be attended  by experts from Asian and Pacific countries and the United  Nations, they said.    At the environment conference for Asia and the Pacific (ECO  Asia '93) held in Chiba last June, Japan's Environment Agency  pledged to draw up a report on such measures with the help of  other Asia-Pacific nations and the U.N. The first meeting on  the project called "ECO Asia 21 Plan" will decide on the date of  release of the report while discussing concrete measures, the  officials said.    Japan will tell the meeting that it wants to submit an  interim report to a gathering of the Economic and Social  Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) to be held next year  and a final report to a special U.N. General Assembly session in  1997, they said. The plan will propose policies, financial aid  and international cooperation needed to maintain the environment  and yet promote development in the region. The experts will  draft the program after making projections for the region's  future population, economic growth, manufacturing, agriculture,  forestry, demand for energy, state of urban areas, and  environmental conservation policies, the officials said.</p>

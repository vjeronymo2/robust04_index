			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Surge in US orders points to steady recovery MORE signs emerged yesterday that the US economy has embarked on a steady, if not yet ebullient, recovery, with the announcement of a surge last month in durable goods orders. The Commerce Department said new orders for durable goods rose by 3.9 per cent in October, to total Dollars 124.4bn (Pounds 82.3bn) after seasonal adjustment. Excluding defence equipment, new orders rose 2.2 per cent. Republican politicians have complained that economists and journalists have been willing to proclaim a recovery on the basis of buoyant economic statistics since Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic candidate, won the presidential election last month, after turning a deaf ear to President George Bush's claims that a recovery was under way. Governor Clinton is working on an economic stimulus package, to be put into place soon after his inauguration on January 20. He is expected to invite businessmen, economists and politicians to his Arkansas state capital of Little Rock on December 14-15 for an economic summit. Economists and financial markets were yesterday cautious in their reaction to the durable goods announcement, although it outstripped the average market forecast of a 1 per cent gain. Most of the increase stemmed from a 20 per cent rebound to Dollars 32.2bn in orders for vehicles and aircraft. Adding to caution was a 4.5 per cent decline in new orders for industrial machinery and equipment, although orders for non-defence capital goods showed a solid advance of 2.5 per cent, cementing an 8.5 per cent increase in September. 'The gains weren't widespread. October's report reflects an industrial sector that's growing, slowly,' said Mr Ed Yardeni, economist at brokers C J Lawrence in New York. Other indicators, however, showed that both consumers and businesses are starting to show more confidence. The Conference Board, a New York-based business grouping, yesterday announced a revival in its consumer confidence index for November, although optimism only returned to the level of early last summer. But Mr Fabian Linden, executive director of the board's consumer research centre, said the 11 point increase in November took the index only to a level that has historically been linked with a lacklustre economy. 'We have a long way to go before we are in a full recovery mode,' he said. A business confidence index compiled by Cahners Economics, a Massachusetts economic research group, also showed an increase in optimism in November, although the upturn was modest. Cahners found a sharp increase in the number of businesses which planned to increase production over the next three months but, for the longer term, relatively few businesses planning to invest more heavily in capital equipment.</p>

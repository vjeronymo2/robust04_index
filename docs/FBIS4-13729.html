			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Farhatullah Babar: "After Talbott's Visit, What </F> Next?"]    [Text] Following the visit of US Deputy Secretary of State  to India and Pakistan during which he met both government and  opposition leaders Mr Talbott at his press conference in  Islamabad on April 9 and in the joint Pak-US statement the next  day made some significant observations about breaking the  nuclear deadlock: continued dialogue through quiet diplomacy; no  linkage of Kashmir with nuclear issue; agreement to pursue the  goal of capping then reducing and finally eliminating nuclear  weapons from South Asia; the new US initiative of enhancing  "verifiable" capping with bolstering Pakistan's conventional  defence capability and meeting its security concerns and a  promise by both sides to continue further discussions on it.  These are surely positive signs but they also beg the question:  Where do we go from here?    Perhaps we must begin by formulating key strategic questions  about national security and the nuclear issue and rethink some  of the basic assumptions underlying theories of our national  security. This should be done without in anyway suggesting that  the GHQ [General Headquarters] (which identify threats to  security and formulates a response) is not aware of the  imperatives of such an exercise. Nor to throw odium on the  generals as did the noted Indian columnist Khushwant Singh the  other day in a newspaper interview "After all a vaila (idle)  soldier with a gun in his hand has no sense of responsibility".    A problem with the military mind set is to militarise the  realities and perceive national security only in terms of the  number of army divisions, air force squadrons and naval frigates  and submarines. It rarely occurs to the brass that if such were  the dynamics of national security then smaller nations would not  have existed alongside larger neighbours. For generals, air  marshals and admirals the response to challenges of national  security is gun for a gun, bullet for a bullet, bomber for a  bomber and submarine for a submarine forgetting other vital  elements of state power such as human development, social  cohesion, national integration and people's participation in the  shaping of their destinies. Did the Soviet Union not  disintegrate because of its criminal neglect of the social and  human dimensions of survival and development?    Related to it is another characteristic peculiar to the  military mind. A former three star general confided with this  scribe the other day, "we in the army know only how to spend,  not how to earn. Wherefrom the money comes, he said, is the  concern of some Sartaj Aziz or a Mahboobul Haq or a Jaffarey.  Beg, borrow or steal but give us money for weapons. This is the  military's logic. That is why the caretaker prime minister Moin  Qureshi -- a crusadar of human and social development -- once  said during his brief stint what lengthy discourses would not be  able to convey. "Curtailing military budget" he warned in  Peshawar, "would amount to playing with fire". It was no idle  warning.    We must begin to ponder over a few strategic questions.  Answers to these questions are essential to correct our  bearings and chart out our future course in a vastly changed  world when the Berlin Wall has collapsed, a superpower has  disintegrated, economic rather than military prowess has become  the determinant of inter state relations and with the end of the  Cold War, the issues of disarmament and non-proliferation have  come to the centre stage of international relations. Here are  the eight basic and fundamental strategic questions:    -- FIRST: Will our security be enhanced or undermined by  open  acquisition of nuclear weapons and brandishing them too as we  have been doing in the past? Will our acquisition of nuclear  weapons deter or provoke India to do likewise and in that event  whose security would be more undermined -- India's or Pakistan's  -- keeping in view India's vast scientific, technological and  nuclear infrastructure and geographical advantages?    -- SECOND: Is the overall cost of nuclear weapons  development  bearable for a country like Pakistan -- cost not simply in terms  of fabricating a crude device but also in terms of constantly  improving and upgrading it, building delivery systems apart from  the intangible cost iof diplomatic and political isolation, lost  opportunities of International cooperation in the development of  nuclear power plants for power generation and the suspension of  economic and military aid?    -- THIRD: Can a weapon of ultimate resort like the nuclear  weapon be used in any eventuality? Since World War II it has not  been used. Former US president Nixon has recalled how on five  different occasions he came close to deciding about using a  nuclear weapon -- thrice over Vietnam -- but each time after  debate and reconsideration, decided not to. Should a weapon  which cannot be used be made at all and that too at such an  exorbitant cost?    -- FOURTH: Does the so called theory of deterrence still  hold good or it needs reexamination. [sentence as published]  The post Hiroshima history begs the question: what if a nation  is not deterred? Vietnam was not deterred by the US. Afghanistan  could not be deterred by the mighty nuclear arsenal of the USSR.  And more recently, Iraq was not deterred by US nuclear weapons  even though it was routed in the end by superior conventional  military technology. Is there any sound basis for our  presumption that in case of India, it will be deterred and not  provoked by a nuclear Pakistan?    -- FIFTH: Granted that India is our enemy, is immoral and  wicked. But is India also so fanatic to expose itself to  unacceptable damage by starting a nuclear war with Pakistan?    -- SIXTH: "In the event of a first strike", claimed General  Beg recently in Karachi, " India's conventional capability will  be wiped out". Sounds pleasing to the ears. But what if India  strikes first, or absorbs the first strike and retaliates? Will  we be able to withstand it.    -- SEVENTH: In spite of universal clamour for a complete ban  on nuclear testing, Britain and France are reluctant because  they still consider testing of a nuclear weapon essential for  inducting it into the war machine as a reliable weapon. This is  because a battlefield nuclear weapon is vastly different from a  nuclear device (which may have more propaganda but little  strategic value). Pakistan's alleged nuclear device remains  untested. What if it turns out to be a dud and the bluff is  called?    -- EIGHTH: We seek to link the resolution of Kashmir with  Pakistan's nuclear capability. But Kashmiris are now on their  own, fighting their own battle of liberation. How can we take  Kashmiris for granted in a nuclear bargain with the US? What if  tomorrow the Kashmiris demand the third option of independence  and reject the Pakistani price?    These are only some of the strategic questions and answers  which are unlikely to come for discussion behind closed doors in  the GHQ or in the semi-lit corridors of the Foreign Office.  Answer to them may be found by tearing apart the shroud of  secretary around theories of national security and initiating an  open public debate. When Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto told the  brass at the National Defence College last month the "problems  of security and development need an integrated approach" she was  only making an understatement because perhaps she too does not  want to play with fire. It will be a pity if the nuclear roller  coasters kept their eyes shut to the realities. They must  remember that the stern dynamics of nations' survival and  development seldom pause for pity.</p>

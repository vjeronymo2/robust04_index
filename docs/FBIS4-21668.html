			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast: Video report from Severodvinsk </F> by V. Loyter and D. Rasskazov, identified by caption]    [Text] [170950] [Loyter over video of industrial  facilities, with camera homing in on "Zvezdochka" plant] The  information ballyhoo around radioactive waste recycling has not  bypassed Severodvinsk. This is understandable. Over the past  30 years more than enough problems have accumulated at  enterprises of this center of nuclear shipbuilding. While the  spent nuclear fuel still has its uses -- the fuel rods are sent  to the Mayak Combine in the southern Urals -- no one is  interested in the metal, which also absorbs quite a bit of  radiation. The storage facilities built for this purpose at the  "Zvezdochka" plant are full to the brim.    In cooperation with specialists from the center of nuclear  shipbuilding, the Arkhangelsk Oblast Committee has drawn up a  program to ensure nuclear and radiation safety. The oblast  leaders have suggested that all departments interested in  solving this problem, which is of crucial importance for the  population of this entire region and which can no longer be  shrugged off, get together in Arkhangelsk.

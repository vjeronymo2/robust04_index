			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The weekly forum of the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs convened today. Foreign Minister Dr. Husayn Sulayman  Abu Salih spoke at the forum, reviewing Sudanese-Eritrean  relations, Sudanese-British relations, the visit of the  archbishop of Canterbury and the visit of the deputy president  of the Chinese state council and minister of foreign affairs to  the Sudan. [passage omitted]    Speaking about Sudanese-British relations, the minister of  foreign affairs reviewed the past history of relations with  Britain and emphasized that relations with the West need to be  based on adequate foundations through dialogue for the benefit  of both sides, as seen by the British crown prince.    The foreign minister said that the expulsion of the British  ambassador is final, as the ambassador no more serves the  interests of relations between the two countries and has become  an obstacle in the way of bilateral relations. He said that the  decision does not mean the failure or cutting off of relations,  but that the situation requires the appointment of an ambassador  who believes in the importance of these relations.    As to the visit of the archbishop of Canterbury to the  Sudan,  the minister said that the invitation was extended by the  Sudanese Episcopal Church, which groups 17 bishops, and that the  invitation was not extended by the rebel movement. He said the  archbishop rejected the invitation of the Sudanese Church and  contacted the factions of the rebel movement at their sites in  the Sudanese border areas held by the rebels, indicating that  such a visit is considered a violation of the national  sovereignty of the Sudan and a backing of the rebel movement,  thus a contribution in the deterioration of relations between  the two countries. The foreign affairs minister wondered  whether the British officials would allow an Islamic leader to  visit Ireland and talk with the leaders of the IRA. [passage  omitted]</p>

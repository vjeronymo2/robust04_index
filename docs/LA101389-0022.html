			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HUNTERS PLAY KEY ROLE IN CONSERVATION  </P> <P> The letters you printed Sept. 30 in response to the article "Changing Stripes"  show, unfortunately, how ill-informed the public really is. Our news media and  the so-called "Friends of Animals" have no concept of what conservation is and  the role hunting really plays. If it wasn't for the revenues generated and the  donations made by the hunting community, there wouldn't be any "Bambis" left.  The true conservationist understands that we must balance the land, the animals  and the amount of space that man allows nature to be as she once was before man  changed the ecological balance with concrete and steel. Conservation costs  money, and, by allowing a certain number of animals to be harvested for a fee,  we can afford to maintain their habitat and environment and promote the  continuation and growth of the species.  </P> <P> The true big-game hunter doesn't just kill to kill but uses the animal he  harvests for food and the trophy for the memory of the hunt. Nothing is wasted.  Not everyone can be a true hunter. People eat fish, fowl and meat, and just  because they didn't kill their food doesn't mean that it wasn't killed. Fish  die by suffocation, fowl by mechanical strangulation and meat by wholesale  annihilation. Is this compassionate? I think not!  </P> <P> JOHN HUTCHESON, San Gabriel  </P></p>

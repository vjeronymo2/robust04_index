			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR SOME, FINDING LOVE CAN BE A TALL ORDER  </P> <P> The San Gabriel Valley Tall Singles held a barbecue and pool party this month  at Marita Pinkel's house in Arcadia. Men were supposed to be at least 6 feet  tall; women, 5-foot-8. A few didn't quite measure up but stuck around anyway, a  development that was remarked upon by purists in the group.  </P> <P> Marilyn Longstreet, a 6-foot-2 critical-care nurse who's been going to tall  singles events around the country for more than 20 years, sized up the mixed  crowd on Pinkel's lawn with a critical eye. "Most of the Tall Clubs expect the  men to be 6-2, and the girls have to be at least 5-10," she grumped, gesturing  toward a shorty or two. "They even used to have initiations and measurings."  </P> <P> On the tall club circuit, which stretches from Culver City to Fountain Valley  to Riverside, the San Gabriel Valley club is about as liberal as they get. One  woman, a once in awhile participant, even confessed to friends as the party was  warming up that she was really only 5-foot-6.  </P> <P> "Me? I'm 1,830 millimeters," Eric Kaczynski said self-righteously. One of the  marginal men, he stretched to his full height -- six feet.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Tape Measures  </P> <P> But nobody was going around with a tape measure Saturday night. The emphasis  was supposed to be more on having a good time than on imposing rigorous  physical standards. At least, that's the way Pat McGookin saw it. "It's the  person that's important, not the size of the package," said McGookin, a  5-foot-10 grandmother from Pasadena, standing shoulder-deep in the pool, the  palms of her hands moving gently against the water.  </P> <P> The seven-year-old organization certainly has its share of people who have to  duck going through doors. Rob over there, for example. He could easily slam  dunk without standing on a chair. A limber 6-foot-6 Cal State Northridge  accounting major, Rob gives you the restless young man's perspective on the  club. "A lot of young people come and get disappointed," said Rob, 28. "The way  I see it, this could be a total bust, but it's early. Every place else that I  ordinarily go to is still open."  </P> <P> The idea of the club, which has accumulated a mailing list of more than 500  tall people, is to provide a low-pressure setting for the rangy crowd to get  together, said Joan Brady, a YWCA executive who is one of the organization's  founders. "It's hard enough being single, but if you're a 6-foot-1 woman,  sometimes it's difficult meeting people," she said.  </P> <P> There are activities almost every weekend -- pool parties, game nights, beach  excursions and, about eight times a year, discount weekends in Palm Springs.  "It's a real nice club," said Brady, who is 5-foot-10. "We get nice-quality  people."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Young Meets Old  </P> <P> Heterogeneous, too. There's probably a 35- to 40-year spread between youngest  and oldest. And maybe a 12-inch spread between shortest and tallest.  </P> <P> Spread out in Pinkel's yard or lollygagging in the pool, the three dozen or so  singles didn't look much different from the singles crowd anywhere else  nowadays: wary, studiously blase, their eyes drifting frequently to the door to  see who might be coming through.  </P> <P> "I'm not here to meet anybody," Longstreet said. "I just want to talk to  people, dance. I feel more comfortable here than other places."  </P> <P> There's a certain vulnerability to being single nowadays, Brady says. "The  climate of singleness has changed," she said. "People want partners."  </P> <P> Maybe so. But the business of coupling was flowing like molasses this evening.  A big three-quarter moon floated up over the pepper tree next door, and Pinkel,  a native of Upstate New York who delights in playing hostess, turned on the  lights in the pool. "The Jacuzzi's getting hot, folks," Pinkel announced  invitingly.  </P> <P> Time to talk about romance. Well, how about frustrated romance?  </P> <P> "I've been coming a year (to Tall Club events)," said Tessy Muir, a willowy  elementary schoolteacher in a wide-brimmed hat, "and I've only met one decent  guy."  </P> <P> "I've met two guys, but they just sort of disappeared," piped in Muir's best  friend, Robin Hansen, an Army reservist who was wearing an Army T-shirt.  </P> <P> The singles scene in the San Gabriel Valley, with its Pasadena restaurants and  Monrovia nightclubs, is as pressured and unrewarding as it is anywhere else,  club members said. "There are a lot of clubs around if you want to just hang  out with your peers," said Rob, still wearing his sunglasses. "All the trendy  places are somewhere else."  </P> <P> But bar-hopping can run into a lot of money. "You go to a bar and dance with  somebody, then she turns away and dances with somebody else," said Rob, who  gets by on a student's stipend. "Or else you follow her around all night." Rob  met a tall single one night and took her out. "She said she didn't mind paying  her own way, but I think she did," he said gloomily.  </P> <P> Bob, a muscular bruiser who looks as if he could paint the ceiling without  using a ladder, is a first-timer this evening. He isn't sure he'll be back. "I  usually don't go with tall women," said Bob, 35, a factory supervisor. "They're  not that good-looking. I've been married before, and I'm looking for a  particular kind of woman." Like what? "Petite and good looking."  </P> <P> There's a fundamental injustice about tallness, several women say. It can be  seen as desirable in men ("Read the personals and the women are always looking  for somebody tall," said one woman.) but a liability in women.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'It Was the Pits'  </P> <P> "I was always taller than all the guys," said Chicago-born Dorothy Prince, a  statuesque 5-foot-11. "It was the pits. I think I was 5-9 in junior high. I did  not date in high school."  </P> <P> The Canadian-born Longstreet ran into similar difficulties. "When you're a  teen-ager, it's a big complex," she said. "I got used to seeing people see me  and then take a second look."  </P> <P> But standards are changing, club members said. The old taboo about women not  dating men shorter than themselves is eroding. "You don't get ridiculed any  more if you do it," said Prince.  </P> <P> "All of those rules have been thrown out," Brady said.  </P> <P> Still, you want somebody who fits, Prince said. "My friend Pauline says she's  tired of looking guys straight in the eyes," she said. "I'm tired of looking  down at them. At least you know the men here are attracted to tall ladies."  </P> <P> By evening's end, no one had made that all-important love connection. At least,  not that anyone else could tell. "A lot of people come, then you won't see them  for awhile, and you hear they're dating," said Brady. "That happens a lot."  </P> <P> Of course, those kinds of things don't always work out. "Sometimes they come  back in six months and say they've split up," she said. "Or else you never see  them again, because they're afraid they'll see the guy at one of our  functions."  </P> <P> But there's also the occasional jackpot. "I brought a longtime friend to one of  our parties," said Brady, "and introduced him to the hostess. A few months  later, I asked her if she wanted to have another party. She said, 'I can't,  because Jim and I are getting married.' "  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Give It a Chance'  </P> <P> The churlish Bob had left early, apparently in search of a more petite partner,  but Rob was sticking it out. By 10, he was dispiritedly counting his blessings.  "You got to give it a chance," he said. "It's not a bad way to spend an  afternoon, even if you don't score."  </P> <P> Pat McGookin, who says she has been to every disco between San Diego and San  Francisco in the 17 years since she got her divorce, takes a more philosophical  view. Don't get hung up on the search, she suggested. "My theory is: If you go  someplace and you're having a good time," she said, "other people will want to  share that good time."  </P> <P> "Life is like a piano," Marita Pinkel added brightly. "It's how you play it  that makes a difference."  </P></p>

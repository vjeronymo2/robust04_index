			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HUNDREDS WAIT FOR THANKSGIVING IN A BOX;  </P> <P> CHARITY: ORANGE COUNTY RESCUE MISSION OFFERS HOLIDAY BASICS FOR ABOUT 400 NEEDY  PEOPLE WHO STOOD IN LINE FOR SEVERAL HOURS.  </P> <P> Ida Jones was in a quandary: The 68-year-old retiree had four grandchildren  visiting from out of town but no money on her Social Security income to buy  turkey and the trimmings for Thanksgiving.  </P> <P> Then she heard about the turkey dinner giveaway at the Orange County Rescue  Mission and her problem was solved. Wednesday morning, she showed up to claim  her share.  </P> <P> "I just wanted to fix some turkey and dressing for the kids," a smiling Jones  said as she waited for a ride home with her box of food. "You know how kids  are."  </P> <P> Jones was one of about 400 people who stood in a block-long line for up to four  hours Wednesday to claim the holiday food box for their families. All had stood  in equally long lines at the mission last week to get tokens making them  eligible for a care box. Eligibility was limited to local families in need, but  there was at least one reported case of a transient taking his box and selling  it for $5 on the street.  </P> <P> The mission on West Walnut Street in Santa Ana is in its 26th year of providing  free Thanksgiving dinners to families.  </P> <P> John F. Lands, mission executive director, said the giveaway has grown to match  the demand. Five years ago, he said, the mission was handing out 50 boxes of  food. Next year, he predicted, the number would top 600. The shelter also  prepares a Thanksgiving Day dinner for the homeless and today they expect as  many as 3,000 to show up.  </P> <P> The increasing turnout of destitute families shows there is a growing problem  of poverty in Orange County, Lands said.  </P> <P> Many people interviewed at the mission Wednesday said that illness and other  bad luck had recently thrust them into the ranks of the unemployed, forcing  them to accept handouts.  </P> <P> "I'm really happy that we've got this giveaway because we wouldn't have had a  dinner otherwise," said a 43-year-old mother of two young daughters who said  she lost her job as a card dealer after she was injured in a traffic accident.  </P> <P> But poverty was no stranger to many others waiting in line. A sizable number  were Latino immigrants from Mexico and Central America, many of whom work at  minimum-wage jobs or live with friends and relatives.  </P> <P> At the head of the line was Juanita Carranza, a 60-year-old El Salvadoran  immigrant who said she is caring for her seven young grandchildren whose mother  died in childbirth last spring. Carranza and her husband, who is too old to  work, received a box containing a stuffed turkey, a loaf of bread, canned  beets, and stew and mashed potato mix.  </P> <P> Carranza, who said she had helped bring in money as a housecleaner until an  automobile accident sidelined her six months ago, was upbeat as the holiday  approached.  </P> <P> "America is great!" she said, beaming. "We have liberty, expression and  everything."  </P> <P> Carranza said that she would be putting her turkey in the oven this morning so  that Thanksgiving dinner could be ready by early afternoon. Although it is not  a holiday in her native land, she said her grandchildren, ages 4 through 13,  were born in this country and look forward to Thanksgiving Day.  </P> <P> "This is a big day," she said.  </P> <P> The sight of so many people gathered outside the rescue mission attracted  others who got in line without tokens for a free care box. And with 75 no-shows  among those deemed eligible, the mission did hand out boxes to late-comers such  as Maria Ilveo Fuentes, 33, an El Salvadoran immigrant who arrived in this  country with her six children only last month.  </P> <P> Fuentes, an electronics-plant worker from the capital city of San Salvador,  said she had to pay a smuggler $300 for herself and each of her children to  cross the U.S.-Mexican border at Tijuana.  </P> <P> As a result, she said, "I arrived here with no money."  </P> <P> On hand for crowd control were a handful of orange-shirted mission workers such  as Roy Vincent, who made sure no one tried to cut in line or start fights.  </P> <P> Vincent and the others said the crowd was peaceable, with only a few instances  of attempted line-bucking. After the boxes had been handed out, Vincent shook  his head at a throng of about two dozen people without tokens who had waited in  hopes of getting food.  </P> <P> "It's kind of a shame that we can't give everybody a meal," Vincent said. "Some  of these people really, really need it."  </P></p>

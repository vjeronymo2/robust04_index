			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Mind over motor in the car bazaar: The hopes and fears behind today's K-registration plates IT WAS party time last night at the Reg Vardy motor group's flagship Nissan dealership, which stands almost in the shadow of the Japanese carmaker's plant near Sunderland. Mr Neil Dunkley, the dealership's general manager, estimated about half of the more than 140 customers who ordered new Nissans for August delivery with the new K plate registration would turn up for the party. At the stroke of midnight, they would drive home in their new purchases, and Reg Vardy would celebrate what has been a unexpectedly strong sales period. The group's 21 sales and service outlets pre-sold for August as many new cars as they sold throughout August last year. Meanwhile, far to the south, in Fulham, west London, Mr Graham Horder, owner and managing director of Cheyne BMW, claims to be rubbing his hands in anticipation of a bonanza of August new car sales. 'Last year we delivered 87 BMWs during August, which was a good result given the circumstances,' he says. 'This year we have already got August orders for 134 cars, and they are still coming in each day.' Both dealers either occupy an apparently recession-proof island in the moribund UK economy, or August new car sales this year will confound the anxieties of manufacturers and the big dealers. The indications are that, when the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders tots up sales figures in early September, August will have provided little to cheer about. Indeed, suggests Professor Garel Rhys, the SMMT's own professor of Motor Industry Economics at Cardiff Business School, the figures may finally demonstrate that it is now time to abandon the annual new car registration prefix. August accounts for about 25 per cent of total annual sales. July's market has been reduced to little over 2 per cent and, as early as late April, potential buyers are holding back, waiting for the new prefix. As the August bulge has grown, so it has left fewer sales for the final four months of the year. The fear this year is that prolonged recession and July's gloomy statistics on rising unemployment and collapsing confidence indicate that the August car sales bulge will not be big enough to take up the stock of cars that UK-based manufacturers have built. According to Prof Rhys, there is already an excess stock of 40,000 new cars scattered around the countryside. As recently as March, the industry expected sales this year to recover to 1.7m-1.75m units, up from last year's depressed 1.59m. Now, it fears there will be little or no improvement on last year. The result is that the recent cut-price bazaar atmosphere in car retailing may continue through the year to clear unsold stocks. Some motor trade executives like Mr Reg Heath, chief executive of TKM, which controls one of the UK's largest retailing networks, believes this bazaar atmosphere may last well into next year. Growing urgency to 'move the metal' has prompted some innovative marketing schemes. They include Ford's 'Options' package, under which a purchaser finances the net cost of a car's purchase price less its projected depreciation after two years. At the end of the period, he or she can opt to hand back the car and start a new agreement, or pay the rest of the purchase price. Ford, which is struggling to reverse a market share slide from about 30 per cent in the 1980s to the low 20 per cents now, hopes most people will opt for another new car. Vauxhall has already hit back with a similar scheme, called 'Choices', with the added lure of a Pounds 300 bonus for any new Nova, Cavalier, Carlton, Senator or Calibra registered up to August 31. In spite of having spent about Pounds 50m promoting and advertising such schemes in July alone, the industry fears that this August sales will not exceed last August's 370,000 and will be far short of the record 530,000 achieved of August 1989. According to Mr Heath of TKM, both the trade and the industry have no option but to tighten their belts, keep overheads tight and sit it out for a recovery  - which, he notes in an ironic reference to government forecasts, 'doesn't look like coming now until the fifth quarter of 1992'. Like Prof Rhys and Mr Neil Marshall, economist at the Retail Motor Industry Federation, he is stuck for suggestions on how the govern-ment might restore con-sumer confidence, short of sharp interest rate cuts and sterling's realignment within ERM. The infuriating thing, says Mr Marshall, is that 'we know there is plenty of money about, and that the savings ratio is exceptionally high. What we have is a psychological problem. It's deeply disturbing for us and, with most economic indicators pointing in the wrong direction, we simply don't know when it's going to go away.' For those with the cash and the courage, however, there is one old motor trade 'come-on' which has never been more valid: there has never been a better time to buy a car.</p>

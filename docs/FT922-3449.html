			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / World News In Brief: Westminster bomb damages row of shops A bomb explosion damaged shops close to the House of Commons shortly before midnight last night, but Scotland Yard said there were no casualties. The area, around Victoria Street, was sealed off and the Anti-terrorist Squad called in. Police said the blast, which followed a phone warning to the BBC, was caused by a 'very small device' of high explosive placed in a litter bin. There was only superficial damage to windows. Labour MP Max Madden, leaving the Commons after a debate on renewing emergency powers in Northern Ireland, was within 40 yards of the blast. 'It was quite a loud explosion,' he said. It was hoped Victoria Street would be open for the morning rush hour.</p>

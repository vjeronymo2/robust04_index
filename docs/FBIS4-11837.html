			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Abu-Salih: There Is Sectarian </F> Dissimilarity Between Sudan and Iran"]    [Excerpt] Cairo, AL-HAYAH -- Sudanese Foreign Minister Dr.  Husayn Abu-Salih has announced that his country will agree to  resume the Egyptian-Sudanese talks on the disputed Hala'ib  triangle in Khartoum in accordance with what was agreed with  Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa last July.    He said in a press conference held in the foreign  correspondents association in Cairo yesterday that his country's  agreement to hold talks on the Hala'ib triangle represents a  kind of concession. He said: "I pledged to safeguard Sudan's  sovereignty over its territory."    He added: "Hala'ib is Sudanese." He said that Egypt's  decision to establish a new electoral constituency there is  tantamount to an Egyptian confirmation that it has never  belonged to Egypt before. He described his country's decision to  appoint a governor for Hala'ib as an internal matter within the  framework of its sovereignty over its territory.    He said: "The governor will go there to assume the duties of  his post at whatever time he wants." He expressed Sudan's  willingness to accept mediation or arbitration with regard to  the triangle.    Abu-Salih urged Egyptian officials to "stop pursuing the  fait  accompli policy and to consider the triangle a disputed  territory." He held Egypt responsible for "the delay in  convening the ministerial meeting in Khartoum."    On Egypt's criticisms of Sudan for sheltering extremists,  Abu-Salih renewed his invitation for an Egyptian security  delegation to visit Sudan to ascertain there are no terrorist  camps in Sudan. He said that "Sudan's security is linked to  Egypt's security, and Sudan would not allow Egypt's security to  be threatened from its territory."    He denied that Sudan has received any Egyptian lists  demanding the extradition of a group of extremists who are  wanted to appear before the Egyptian judiciary. He stressed  that "Sudan has not received any lists." He expressed "Sudan's  willingness to bolster security cooperation between the two  countries."    With regard to Sudan's relationship with Iran, he described  this relationship as "less than normal." He pointed out that  "Sudan is Sunni...and Iran is Shiite, and there is a difference  between the two sects."    He added: "Sudan is entitled to establish relations with any  state without interference from anyone." He said that "any talk  about this relationship is interference in Sudanese internal  affairs -- which we reject." He strongly denied the presence in  Sudan of any forces from the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. He  said: "Anyone who has such evidence should submit it."    Regarding the presence of [Saudi businessman] Usamah  Bin-Ladin [in Sudan] and his support for fundamentalist  extremists, he said: "Usamah Bin-Ladin lives in Sudan normally  and is engaged in construction work on the most vital road in  Sudan, that is the Khartoum-'Atbarah road. About 170 km of this  road have been completed. He has no activities other than his  trade businesses."    Abu-Salih said: "Madeleine Albright, U.S. permanent  representative to the United Nations, will visit Sudan the day  after tomorrow, Thursday, in the framework of the Sudanese-U.S.  talks. We are waiting for the message which she will carry from  U.S. President Bill Clinton to Sudanese President 'Umar Hasan  al-Bashir." He expects the message to deal with the Sudanese  peace talks held in Nairobi recently.    He added that Sudan has indictment evidence against states  he  did not name and Israel, "supported with documents showing the  types of weapons seized from southerners during the fighting,  but we prefer not to reveal this evidence at present."

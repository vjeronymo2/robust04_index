			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Oleg Zhirnov: "The Central Election Commission </F> Revealed the Secret of the Contributions. The Duma Covered It  Up"]    [Text] The Central Election Commission of the Russian  Federation sent the State Duma a document, according to which  almost one out of every four deputies should be deprived of his  mandate.    In accordance with the Statute on Elections of Deputies of  the State Duma, the Central Election Commission has no later  than three months following the official publication of the  election results to present the State Duma with an account of  the expenditure of monetary resources by the election  associations. No later than a month following its receipt by the  Duma this account should be published in "publications in which  federal laws are to be published and communicated to other news  media."    All the deadlines have passed. Nothing has been published  anywhere. There is not even the Central Election Commission  account to the Duma.    This is not entirely the case, though. It is all far more  involved.    Some document from the Central Election Commission was  received in the Duma, apparently. Was received and sank without  trace, causing none of the ripples on the surface which are  expected in such cases.    Your OBSHCHAYA GAZETA observer managed to obtain the  mysterious paper. Even at first glance it evokes a multitude of  questions and misgivings. Printed with grammatical errors and  any old how, the stitched document has neither signature nor  stamps nor source and entry data attesting its receipt in the  chamber. Nor is there the decision in the margins: "Copy and  distribute to the factions"--signed and dated--customary in such  cases.    Hot on the trail, colleagues from the newspaper ZAVTRA have  already randomly extracted and published what is, seemingly, the  tastiest information--data on violations by the Russia's Choice  and Yabloko election associations of the article of the Statute  on Elections... prohibiting the acceptance of monetary donations  from companies formed with foreign participation.    The biggest contributions from donors of this type were paid  into the Russia's Choice election fund: R154.8 million from the  Stolichnyy Joint-Stock Commercial Bank; R130 million from the  Olbi-Diplomat Stock Company; R30 million from the Skyline  Russo-British joint venture. For Yabloko sponsors with foreign  participation were the Viamond LTD Stock Company--R30  million--and the Torgovlya i kredit Stock Company and the  Optsion Bank--R10 million each. The participation of foreign  capital in the Russia's Choice and Yabloko campaigns is reason  in principle to raise the question of deprivation of the  deputies of this faction of their Duma mandates.    But this is not all the document contains. Its basic text is  composed of an affirmation of the numerous "deficiencies in the  election associations' observance of financial discipline." The  absence of documents confirming the actual performance of jobs  and services, for example, are classed as "deficiencies." For  the Democratic Party of Russia for a total of almost R70 million  and for the Party of Russian Unity and Accord for R20.7 million,  for the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia for an absence of  stamps on accounts for R62.9 million, and so forth. The authors  of the document, evidently, on the one hand recognized the  seriousness of the facts and could not fail to adduce them, on  the other, deliberately lowered the categorization of these  abuses to "deficiencies in the observance of discipline." The  account gives the impression of some rough copy or memorandum  conveyed confidentially for the familiarization of the requisite  persons or of a trial balloon released to test the retaliatory  response. But what is most surprising and incomprehensible is  the subsequent fate of this document.    The Duma factions know of, remember, and have opinions about  the document. The Russia's Choicers, whose guilt it establishes,  maintain that Russia's Choice and Yabloko are the sole election  associations to have honestly and openly published their sources  of financing. This, allegedly, is why they were hit. Others also  would, most likely, be found to have similar sins: The Germans'  funding of the LDPR is known, after all. The deputy who handed  your OBSHCHAYA GAZETA observer the document expressed the hope  that the newspaper would "dig up" violations among Russia's  Choice's opponents also: "Go looking--there are no honest  communists." Russia's Choice had even prepared a complaint to  the Central Election Commission demanding publication of all the  data, but it was not sent.    Nonetheless, the sight of the document in the hands of a  journalist had literally a shock effect on the Duma authorities  that it concerned primarily, it would seem. People in the  Credentials Commission had a stunned look: "Where did you get  this? We don't have this." They asked to make a copy, but  immediately had second thoughts. Oleg Shenkarev, deputy chairman  of the commission, repeated several times that this was an  "extremely delicate" matter and that "a serious picture  emerges." And hereupon categorically declared that until the  commission had a document with signatures and a stamp, it would  be examining nothing.    The curtain on the mysterious origin of the strange paper  was  lifted slightly when your OBSHCHAYA GAZETA observer turned for  clarification to Valentin Kovalev, deputy chairman of the State  Duma. Valentin Alekseyevich also acknowledged that he had not  seen the Central Election Commission account and also asked to  make a copy, kindly agreeing to comment on the document "from  the legal standpoint." But at the time scheduled for the  interview he also suddenly began to have misgivings: Was this an  authentic account of the Central Election Commission? "Why do I  not have it? Such documents should be on my desk! We have just  now learned that this document was not received by the Duma."    In the presence of your OBSHCHAYA GAZETA observer he,  however, telephoned State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin, who  confirmed the authenticity of the document and announced that it  was being distributed in the Duma with his consent. Replacing  the receiver, Kovalev suddenly remembered that "the Duma Council  considered this document on its merits and adopted the decision  to take note of it."    Valentin Alekseyevich himself described this decision as  "highly neutral." While cautioning that this "does not mean that  the matter is closed--it could be considered at a sitting of the  State Duma also," the deputy chairman emphasized that for this  "someone has to raise the issue. It is not being contemplated  thus far, according to my information."    "As a lawyer," Kovalev concluded that legislation made no  provision for legal liability for the violations perpetrated by  Russia's Choice and Yabloko. To the candid question as to why  the opponents of Russia's Choice and Yabloko had not availed  themselves of so splendid an opportunity to get in a political  blow, the deputy chairman, a member of the Communist Party of  the Russian Federation faction, replied with references to the  Duma's preoccupation with problems of the budget and the  achievement of national accord. The same reason was cited also  by Nikolay Travkin, leader of the Democratic Party of Russia  faction: "What business is this of the Duma's? If the Central  Election Commission has discovered violations, let it apply to  the law enforcement authorities. Our faction has no interest in  constantly looking to the past. There is too much to do today to  be rummaging around in yesterday's shit."    Some not so "titled" deputies explain the State Duma's more  than indifferent attitude toward the sins of the election  campaign by reasons of a totally different quality, alas. Not by  the lower house's total immersion in far-reaching business  designed to secure for the country a bright future but by a fear  of touching what--merely a touch--would start to flake off  uncontrollably or cave in completely even. Mikhail Molostvov  believes: "Rummage around, and you will discover the dubious  nature of all the elections. This is why nothing is being said  about this." In the opinion of Ayvars Lezdinsh, "corporate  interest in this case outweighed everything else. Almost  everyone understands that if investigations start, they could  ultimately reach him also. Not only were the factions guilty of  violations, the head-to-head constituency deputies are no  exception either."    The "presidential host" might, perhaps, have made a fuss and  have attempted to deliver the Duma a mortal blow, the opposition  having been caught in financial peccadilloes. But, as ill luck  would have it, its "own people" were caught also. The opposition  also was faced with a dilemma: Should it insist on an annulment  of the election results? The members of the opposition realize  full well that the complete "removal" of their political  adversaries from the Duma would make the lower house an  inoperative body and would break up its whole structure, which  had been put together with such difficulty and in which the  opposition had succeeded in occupying pretty good places.    There is a certain common thread linking the president and  parliament and the Central Election Commission and, most likely,  many others also. This is the actual historical action of 12  December of last year. The hastily organized presidential-model  elections were conducted in a "bundle" with a referendum on a  constitution dear to the president's heart. Violations in one  part of this action would compel reflection on the legality of  the other. This is why both sides are trying not to make a fuss.  Some under the pressure of the sorry necessity of sending others  a semi-official paper deliberately reducing the scale of the  lawlessness, others swiftly and quietly "taking note of it." All  this is reminiscent of the syndrome, well known in psychiatry,  of the forcing into the subconscious of facts of which one is  ashamed and which are dangerous for one's reputation.</p>

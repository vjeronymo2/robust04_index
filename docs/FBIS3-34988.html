			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, </F> chairman of the Yemeni Presidential Council, by unidentified  Voice of America reporter; place and date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Reporter] Ladies and gentlemen, it gives us  pleasure to meet with His Excellency Lieutenant General 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council in the  Republic of Yemen. Your Excellency: Can we say that the  distress is about to be removed, that the cloud is about to  dissolve, and that the crisis is about to be resolved, now that  there has been agreement on signing the pledge and accord  document in Amman on Sunday [20 February]?    [Salih] Thank you very much. God willing, this cloud will  dissolve. It has damaged Yemen's reputation on the  international level and also on the level of the Arab family and  the Yemeni homeland. God willing, this cloud will dissolve by  signing the pledge and accord document in Amman, perhaps on  Sunday. God willing, we will then address another concern:  implementing the articles of this accord. These articles are  not difficult; they are rather very simple indeed. This  agreement was basically part of the government's policy  statement on whose basis the government won the House of  Representatives' vote of confidence. The only new thing in this  accord is that the Political Forces Dialogue Committee signed  it. One who follows up the government's political program,  according to which it won the confidence, will find that most  articles were already included in this accord.    [Reporter] Specialists say that unity does not require a  search for points of convergence, but for differences in order  to avoid them and fill the gaps in them. Is this what is  actually taking place in the united Yemen?    [Salih] The unity was actually achieved. However, each  crisis has its own negative and positive aspects. Thus, there  is nothing new. The pledge and accord document has been  finalized. We will move to the phase of implementing it. God  willing, the Presidential Council, the Council of Ministers, and  other state organs and institutions will reunite. We believe  that reuniting these institutions will end the crisis. However,  if other state institutions do not reunite, the crisis will not  indeed end.    [Reporter] It was reported that former Yemeni presidents and  some Arab leaders will attend the signing ceremony in Amman.  How true is this report?    [Salih] This issue concerns the hosting state, and does not  concern us as Yemenis. This is because we will sign the pledge  document outside Yemen, so this matter concerns the hosting  state.    [Reporter] The world viewed Yemen with much admiration and  appreciation for your democratic and unionist steps. Are there  subsequent steps to enhance unity and democracy?    [Salih] I believe that the steps will involve implementing  the pledge and accord document, enacting the constitution,  benefiting from the crises that happened, and assessing the  negative and positive aspects of our democratic experience. We  will also do our best, within the framework of solidarity of the  whole leadership, to tackle the repercussions of the crisis. In  fact, the crisis has produced bad repercussions.    [Reporter] Do you plan to add a Constitutional amendment  that would only allow two presidential terms for the president  of the republic?    [Salih] Within the framework of the peaceful handling of  authority and not monopolizing the authority -- and in order to  give hope for anyone who aspires for leadership, and also to  prevent coups and conspiracies -- I earlier announced that a  president's tenure should be confined to only two terms.    [Reporter] Your Excellency the President: May I move to  another issue, namely, Yemen's relationship with foreign  countries? What is the nature of Yemen's relationship with the  Gulf states?    [Salih] During a certain period of time, this relationship  slowed down as a result of the Gulf crisis repercussions.  Intensive and mutual efforts are being exerted with some  brothers in the Gulf states to return matters to normal.  Relations are now good with the Sultanate of Oman, Qatar, and  the United Arab Emirates. Relations with Saudi Arabia are  somewhat good, and are improving day after day. They are also  good with Kuwait and Bahrain. In other words, there is a new  start on returning matters to their previous situation.    [Reporter] Yemen has had known positions on the Palestine  question. Does the recent agreement between 'Arafat and Peres  on implementing the Gaza-Jericho First accord agree with your  positions?    [Salih] In fact, we support the well-being of the  Palestinian Arab people. We, however, were aspiring for  something more than what was reached in the Gaza-Jericho First  peace agreement. Our aspiration was larger than this agreement.  However, as a result of the rift that befell the Arab family,  we accepted these results. We were aspiring for something  greater. Had the Arab nation experienced solidarity and closed  its ranks as part of both the new world order and the economic  and political blocs and groupings, results would have been  better. However, we support the well-being of the brothers in  Palestine.    [Reporter] Your Excellency the President, the last question  is: What is your assessment of Yemeni relations with the United  States at present?    [Salih] Our relationship with the United States is excellent  and advanced. I believe that my visit to the United States in  1990 produced a positive outcome. These relations are advancing  and growing. We are satisfied with the level of relations with  the United States.    [Reporter] Your Excellency President Lt. Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih: We thank you for this meeting, and I wish you success in  your endeavors.</p>

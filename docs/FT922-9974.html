			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Regulation In many ways the proposals put forward by Sir Kenneth Clucas for changing the regulation of UK retail financial services look sensible. Sir Kenneth's central idea - merging the life insurance and unit trust overseer Lautro with Fimbra, the financially strapped body which looks after independent intermediaries - should introduce badly needed stability into the system. The self-regulating organisation (SRO) which emerges will at least be viable, and may even serve to slow down the regrettable contraction of independent financial advice. Externally imposed structures, though, inevitably fail to satisfy all those they are intended to please. Imro, for example, another SRO which looks after investment managers, clearly remains unconvinced by the Clucas argument that regulators should be distinguished from each other by the sort of clients which their members serve. Imro thus looks certain to keep pleading the cause of regulation according to the function of company concerned. Given that Imro stands to lose 30 per cent of its members, it will doubtless be accused of special pleading. But a large number of its members, notably in Scotland, evidently share the concern. Not unreasonably, the likes of fund manager Baillie Gifford wonder why they should have to report to the new SRO on the marketing and administration of unit trusts when this part of their overall business is tiny.</p>

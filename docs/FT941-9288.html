			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / FT Guide to the Winter Olympics (8): Ice-dance favourites return - Skating / Torvill and Dean and other top professional skaters are back in Olympic harness this year. Sandra Stevenson reviews the competition The modern era has finally caught up with figure skating and the Winter Games of 1994 will be considerably richer for it. Amateur and professional classifications are no more. This has brought back such audience favourites as Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean, Brian Boitano, Katya Gordeeva and Sergei Grinkov, and Natalia Mishkutenok and Artur Dmitriev - all past Olympic gold medal winners. T &amp; D, as they are widely and affectionately known, brought Britain to a halt on Valentine's Day 1984, when they won the Olympic gold for ice-dancing with a spellbinding version of Ravel's Bolero. All nine judges awarded it 6.0 for artistic impression, which had never happened before or since in the Olympics. They are still regarded as the world's greatest ice-dancers ever. The question of whether they can live up to that reputation a decade later was answered when they won their seventh national title in Sheffield in January. The judges gave their routine straight 6.0s for artistic impression, a first for a British championship. Also back in harness are the skaters who, in magnificent fashion, won the 1988 mens and pairs gold medals at Calgary, American ace Brian Boitano, and Russians Katya Gordeeva and Sergei Grinkov. Boitano, now 30, suffers pain from past injuries and can only skate for a little over an hour a day. He was second in the recent US championships but still believes that skating in these Olympics is worth the agony he has endured. 'Many people ask why I'm doing this,' Boitano says. 'I can't repeat 1988. That was like angels were lifting me. But I still feel I can skate well and don't want to reach 60 and be regretting that I never took the opportunity.' Boitano, like Torvill and Dean, has faced criticism that he has had his turn and is taking the chances of Olympic competition away from some youngster. Boitano contends: 'I was never a believer in waiting your turn. If you are good enough for Olympic selection, then you earn it.' His fellow American, 22-year-old Kristi Yamaguchi, who won the 1992 womens' Olympic gold medal, can't understand why anyone would want to lay their reputation on the line after the door to the lucrative touring ice show circuit swung open. 'I worked so hard all my life so I could win the gold and become a professional,' Yamaguchi argues. 'Why would I want to go back and risk losing it all? Albertville was an incredible experience but at Lillehammer there would be many more expectations. I'd feel the pressure and it would discourage me from performing my best.' Her predecessor, German skater Katarina Witt - who won in 1984 and 1988, and is the only woman since Sonja Henie to repeat an Olympic singles victory - says it is the challenge that makes for excitement. Witt, 28, exclaimed: 'I love a mountain to climb.' One of the judges at the recent German championship said of Witt: 'For the technical side, four triple jumps is just average. There are many others who can do more. But for the artistic mark she is perfect. No other skater can express her own personality so well through the music except Oksana Bayul and Bayul is just a child compared to Kati.' Bayul is a Ukrainian who won the world title at her first attempt last March  -at the tender age of 15, the youngest since Sonja Henie in 1927. Witt does not have the variety of triple jumps to match Bayul, Szewczenko or Surya Bonaly of France, who was runner-up for the world title to Bayul. Also in the running for gold is Nancy Kerrigan, if the American star is fully recovered from the attack which prevented her from defending her US title in January. None of these rivals take Witt's come-back seriously. But she shrugs off their dismissals. 'There is a place for me. Many in the audience cannot tell one jump from another, yet they say my skating is so beautiful it gives them goosebumps,' says Witt. 'This is what skating is about, not just the most number of jumps.' The other returnees are having an easier time than Witt. The 1988 stars Katya and her now husband Sergei Grinkov had no problem recapturing the Russian pairs championship at the end of December in which they beat the current Olympic champions, Natalia Mishkutenok and Artur Dmitriev. Mishkutenok and Dmitriev had taken a year off to work as professionals but returned this season and in November trounced the Canadian pair who had succeeded them as world champions, Isabelle Brasseur and Loyd Eisler. Brasseur and Eisler, possibly fearing that their chances of Olympic gold are fading, have strongly criticised the return of the professionals. Britain's media have tried hard to coax Marika Humphreys and Justin Lanning to play the same game. In November 1992, Humphreys and Lanning, aged 15 and 19, became the youngest-ever holders of British ice-dance championships but lost the title, and the one Olympic berth, to Torvill and Dean. Lanning admitted he was disappointed when the news that T &amp; D were returning first emerged, but that has been more than compensated for by the opportunity the teenagers have had to train alongside their idols. His partner said: 'When we won they didn't televise the event but this time there was tremendous interest. That's great for skating and for us. And by getting into the top three at the world championship, in Japan in March, Chris and Jayne will earn Britain the right to enter three couples in the 1995 world championships which are in Birmingham.' The reigning Olympic ice dance champions, Marina Klimova and her husband Sergei Ponomarenko, are not returning and have been disdainful of Torvill and Dean's decision. 'They do it for advertisement and promotion,' the Russian Ponomarenko said on German television. If T &amp; D win, their market potential will be enormous. No one has come back to the top after 10 years away. Prior to their Olympic return, the pair had been in the twilight of their career but winning will almost certainly revitalise it. They will probably do another ice show tour through Britain, Australia and the US. 'And if we don't win,' says Torvill, 'We just have to be big enough to accept that.'

			<p>930630 FT  30 JUN 93 / US lifts Angola arms ban THE US has lifted an arms embargo against Angola, allowing the sale of non-lethal military equipment, the State Department said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington. When the embargo is officially lifted later this week the US will review all applications to export defence equipment on a case-by-case basis. A 1991 peace agreement imposed an embargo on both the Angolan MPLA government and Unita rebels until the terms of the accord had been fulfilled. A US official said the embargo was being lifted as part of the normalisation of relations with Angola. Unita's representative to Washington, Mr Jardo Muekalia, objected to the move, saying it would unfairly assist the MPLA government. 'Angola doesn't need more weapons to solve its profound crisis,' he said.</p>

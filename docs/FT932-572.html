			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Economics Notebook: Maastricht casts its shadow across Germany LOVE it or loath it, the Maastricht Treaty just will not go away. It may have slipped out of UK headlines in recent weeks. But it is just about to cast its shadow across Germany. The question as to whether or not the treaty conforms with Germany's constitution will be the subject of a hearing on Thursday and Friday this week before the Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe. Although it will probably be some months before the court comes to a conclusion and makes its judgment public, Germany's policy-making establishment is bracing itself for a thorough-going inquisition. Questions sent by the court in advance to the Bonn government, the Bundesbank and other relevant parties such as the commission in Brussels make clear that doubts about the constitutionality of the Maastricht Treaty are considerable. The court's questions have not been published. But copies seen by the Financial Times suggest that the authorities will have a hard time answering them. Senior German monetary officials involved in the case admit that it is 'serious'. Earlier this month, at a conference in Rome, Mr Horst Schulmann, the president of the state central bank of Hesse and a member of the Bundesbank council, said he expected the court would 'have some admonitions in store'. The court itself has maintained a trappist silence ahead of the hearings. But Mr Schulmann let slip that an imbalance 'between progress in economic and monetary integration and progress in the making of political union in Europe' was at the heart of the Germany's problem over Maastricht. In negotiating the treaty, Germany insisted that it would only give up the D-Mark and the Bundesbank for a single European currency and central bank if it could be sure that these would be just as effective in combating inflation as existing arrangements. It also sought a political union on the grounds that a transfer of sovereignty over monetary and economic policy to a European System of Central Banks (ESCB) would only be acceptable if matched by a commensurate increase in democratic accountability at the community level. While the Bonn government and Bundesbank initially prided themselves that the plans for Emu safeguarded Germany against inflationary perils, the court's questions cast doubt on this. In particular, the court asks whether the Maastricht convergence criteria, which are designed to prevent unsuitable candidates from joining Emu, can be diluted and whether Germany could be obliged to enter stage three of Emu, with its single currency and central bank, against its will. A close reading of the Maastricht Treaty suggests that the answer to both of these questions would be 'yes'. Weightier still are the questions addressing the compatibility of Maastricht with Germany's Basic Law or constitution. The court wants to know how far Article 20 of the Basic Law, which says that 'all state power is rooted in the people', can be squared with a treaty that transfers the part of this power dealing with economic and monetary policy to European authorities of limited democratic accountability. For many Germans, Article 20 has an almost mystical significance as a bulwark against the return of any form of totalitarian government to their country. When the court asks whether Germany might not lose part of its 'autonomy as a democratic state based on the rule of law' and its 'constitutional identity' through the Maastricht Treaty, its questions have to be taken seriously. A look at the questions suggests that the court has become increasingly concerned about the treaty's impact. A first batch sent out by the court focused largely on nitty gritty issues. A second batch was couched in far broader terms to get to the heart of constitutional problems thrown up by Maastricht. That this is so probably owes much to the efforts of Mr Lothar Muller, the president of the Bavarian central bank and a member of the Bundesbank council. Over the past 18 months, he has waged a lonely campaign to bring Germans face to face with the constitutional as well as the economic and monetary implications of the treaty. Mr Muller prides himself on being a 'good European' and has been scrupulous to avoid giving any impression of opposition to European integration. But he has, in a series of lectures and articles in newspapers and learned journals, managed to bring into public view virtually all the of the questions that will now pre-occupy the constitutional court. His most recent article argued that while the German parliament has the power to change the constitution, it cannot take fundamental decisions about sovereignty and the nature of the state. Only the German people can do that. Mr Muller insisted that the Maastricht Treaty, through its plans to create an economic and monetary union, would lead to fundamental change in the German state. The renunciation of monetary sovereignty represented a transfer of sovereign rights affecting the foundations of Germany's constitutional structure, he said. The loss of monetary sovereignty through Emu could mean that the German government and Bundesbank would be unable to achieve their statutory goal of a 'well balanced economy'. Mr Muller is especially concerned that Germany would not be in a position to resist the projected move to the third stage of Emu with its single currency and central bank on January 1 1999 if it so wanted. While the German government has suggested that the planned 1996 intergovernmental conference on political union would give an opportunity to iron out such doubts, the questions put to Bonn by the constitutional court show that it not convinced that Germany has the power to back out of Emu. It is impossible to guess how the court will finally view Maastricht. But it would be a delicious irony if Britain ratifies Maastricht and the treaty finally founders on objections raised in a country that was one of the main authors of the drive to Emu.</p>

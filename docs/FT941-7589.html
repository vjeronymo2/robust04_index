			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Portillo defends curb on spending Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, yesterday underlined his determination to push ahead with the government's long-term review of public spending in spite of accusations from some Tory backbenchers that the project is being quietly shelved. Mr Portillo told the Oxford Union yesterday that the government was determined to pursue its 'root and branch' examination of the spending policies of Whitehall departments, questioning the direction programmes were taking and whether every aspect of the money spent was fully justified. He said: 'Without a rigorous approach to planning and management there is a real danger of public spending rising inexorably as a share of GDP. If spending rises as a share of national income, either taxes must rise or borrowing must rise, or both.' Mr Portillo welcomed the results of fundamental reviews last year in social security, health, education and at the Home Office. He said eight more reviews were under way in areas such as transport, the legal departments, Customs and the Treasury. Some Tory backbenchers were concerned yesterday that - in spite of Mr Portillo's assurances - the government had not cut departmental budgets with the rigour called for in the first four reviews. A senior Tory MP said: 'There is a great deal of scepticism, not about Michael Portillo, but about whether anything will come from this whole process. The reviews are referred to as a crutch whenever ministers are under pressure, but nothing ever seems to happen.' He rejected a claim by Mr Portillo yesterday that a restructuring of social security spending announced in the review had been successfully implemented in the last Budget. Another backbencher said the reform of statutory sick pay arrangements and the increased targeting of benefits were 'already in the pipeline before the last Budget'. He added that an important test of the government's convictions would be whether it was prepared to cut the legal-aid budget in the forthcoming review of legal departments. Mr Portillo was keen yesterday to reject another criticism of the last Budget, that cuts in departmental spending were brought about by using the emergency reserve. He said that money was used in the Budget 'not to boost expenditure programmes but to cut government borrowing'. He added that it had always been spent in previous Budgets, implying that it was wrong for anyone to suggest otherwise.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Chengdu, April 5 (XINHUA) -- A celebration was  held today near the capital of Southwest China's Sichuan  Province for the 2250th anniversary of the Dujiangyan Dam, the  world's oldest functioning irrigation works.    Chinese Premier Li Peng wrote an inscription for the  occasion  to praise the project for its great contribution to agriculture  in Sichuan basin.    Residents at Dujiangyan, an hour's bus ride from the  provincial capital of Chengdu, dressed streets with colorful  flags, raised lanterns, and posted poetic couplets on their  doors. [passage omitted]    Huge sums of money have been poured into the expansion and  reconstruction of the project since 1949. Its irrigated areas  have been increased from 187,000 hectares to about 670,000  hectares over the past four decades.    The dam has become a multi-purpose project combining  irrigation, flood prevention, power generation, fish breeding  and sightseeing.</p>

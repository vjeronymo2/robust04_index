			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / International Company News: Switch of focus expected from Hutchison Telecom THE DEPARTURE of Hutchison Telecommunications managing director, Mr Richard Siemens, has heightened expectations that the Hong Kong conglomerate is to sell part of its UK telecommunications operations and focus future investment on Hong Kong and China. Mr Siemens' resignation followed that of Hutchison Whampoa managing director Mr Simon Murray, who was the fellow architect of the group's billion dollar expansion into mobile telecommunications in Britain. The group is developing PCN and CT2 networks in the UK. This expansion is now being curtailed. Mr Li Ka-shing, chairman, and Canning Fok, Mr Murray's successor, have both expressed concern over the amount of capital required, and the long-term nature of the investment. Mr Siemens has been replaced by Khoo Chek-ngee, former vice-president of mobile communications at Singapore Telecommunication. Mr Chek-ngee's Asian experience further emphasises Hutchison's strategy of retrenching overseas, but expanding in China. Mr Siemens had run the group's telecommunications operations since 1985. The Hong Kong business contributed an operating profit of around HKDollars 600m (USDollars 77m) last year. However, this was almost entirely absorbed by losses from the UK side. Hutchison Telecommunications UK is 65 per cent owned by Hutchison Telecommunications. British Aerospace owns a further 30 per cent.</p>

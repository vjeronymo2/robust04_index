			<p>BFN     [Text] The Malawi Congress Party, MCP, has expressed  concern of the misdemeanor by UDF [United Democratic Front]  supporters in some parts of the country, whom, it said, were  harassing or committing violent acts against its supporters as  they celebrated their party's victory.    In a statement issued in Lilongwe, spokesman for the MCP  said  in the capital city UDF supporters carried a mock coffin of His  Excellency President Ngwazi [paramount] Dr. Kamuzu Banda, while  six houses of MCP supporters have been destroyed in Balaka. The  spokesman said a house belonging to an MCP functionary was  stoned in Blantyre, while some village headmen and chiefs have  been threatened with burning of their houses and dethronement in  Nsanje, (Jaturu), and other districts in the southern region.    The spokesman said such acts and threats were unwarranted  and  called on the president-elect to put an immediate end to them.  He said the MCP would hold the UDF and its leaders responsible  for any damage to property and harm to the MCP supporters. The  spokesman, however, reassured all MCP supporters not to feel  intimidated by anyone because, he said, they are equally  protected by the law and Constitution of this country.</p>

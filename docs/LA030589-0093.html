			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLIPPING OUT  </P> <P> The Endpapers column on flipped-over sayings, "The Proverbial Wisdom of Richard  Poor" (Book Review, Feb. 5) was certainly thought-provoking. I found myself  mentally wandering around picking up old saws and re-examining them. Many of  the more explosive flipovers have already become hackneyed e.g. "Time wounds  all heels!"  </P> <P> Some sayings would have no effervescence if the flipover were not contained in  the saying itself, as in "Winners never quit: Quitters never win!" or "It's not  the size of the dog in the fight, but the size of the fight in the dog!" Or  what about, "Clutching defeat from the jaws of victory"?  </P> <P> And, of course, with a new man in the White House, we should not forget George  Bush's flipover, "I can see the tunnel at the end of the light!" -- whatever  that means.  </P> <P> JOHN TOOMAY  </P> <P> CARLSBAD  </P></p>

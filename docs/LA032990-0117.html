			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Perrier Switches Ad Agencies: Perrier Group fired its ad firm, then rehired its  former agency to create ads for the Perrier Sparkling Water brand. San  Francisco-based Hal Riney &amp; Partners lost the estimated $8-million to  $10-million annual business to Waring &amp; La Rosa, the same New York agency  that lost the business to Riney in 1986. Riney will still handle four other  Perrier brands, including Arrowhead and Calistoga.  </P></p>

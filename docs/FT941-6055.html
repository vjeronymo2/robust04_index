			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Continental slump pulls down GKN: UK group suffers 'worst fall in vehicle production' as French carmaker warns on orders GKN, the engineering and industrial services group, yesterday blamed a 20 per cent fall in profits on declining vehicle production in continental Europe. Pre-tax profits fell Pounds 24.3m to Pounds 97.5m last year, and the company warned that redundancies and non-core disposals were inevitable. Sir David Lees, chairman, said: 'We've seen the worst fall in car and truck production ever recorded in continental Europe. There's not been a year like this since the second world war.' Redundancies are most likely in continental Europe, where demand for GKN's automotive components has fallen sharply. GKN - embroiled in a Pounds 496m hostile bid for Westland, the helicopter maker - claimed continental car production had fallen 20 per cent, while commercial vehicle output was down 26 per cent. Faced with uncertain markets, Sir David warned that reorganisation and redundancies costs - up 54 per cent at Pounds 19.9m - would be a recurring feature. Those costs led to a 15.4 per cent fall in operating profits to Pounds 106.5m. Although the group received Pounds 26.6m from associated companies, compared with Pounds 24.2m, their contribution was undermined by Pounds 19m of losses at UES Holdings, the steelmaker in which GKN has a 39.1 per cent stake. Sir David said that GKN no longer wanted to be involved in steelmaking and intended to focus on three core areas: automotive engineering, industrial services and defence. Of those areas, automotive and engineered products - including GKN Defence - saw operating profits fall 20 per cent to Pounds 76m on flat turnover of Pounds 1.56bn. Profits in the industrial services and distribution division, embracing pallet hire, were unchanged at Pounds 31m on reduced sales of Pounds 463m, against Pounds 471m. Sales by associated companies helped group turnover increase to Pounds 2.64bn, from Pounds 2.53bn. Mr David Turner, finance director, warned: 'Divestments must continue. The number of businesses in GKN will slowly but surely fall.' Redundancy and restructuring costs would exceed Pounds 10m this year as staffing - reduced by 1,800 to 26,400 last year - was cut further, he added. The company was placing greater emphasis on joint ventures in emerging markets and increasing components capacity in the US, where it has embarked on a Dollars 50m expansion. It also predicted that profits in continental Europe, which fell more than 43 per cent to Pounds 38m, would pick up in 1994. It based that optimism on internal estimates that European car production would increase by 4 per cent, a figure queried by industry analysts. Earnings per share fell to 18.7p, compared with Pounds 20.6p. The dividend is unchanged at 20.5p. Losses deepen at UES, Page 26</p>

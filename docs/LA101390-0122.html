			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> $10 MILLION VOTED FOR NEW I-5 CHECKPOINT;  </P> <P> IMMIGRATION: THE BORDER PATROL FACILITY WOULD REPLACE THE PRESENT ONE NEAR SAN  CLEMENTE, BUT IT WOULD BE THREE MILES FARTHER SOUTH.  </P> <P> The U.S. Senate has approved $10 million for initial construction of a new  Border Patrol checkpoint along Interstate 5 south of San Clemente, bringing the  controversial expansion plan one step closer to reality.  </P> <P> The Senate included the appropriation -- which is supported by the Bush  Administration -- as part of the budget package that was approved Thursday.  </P> <P> However, the proposal must survive a Senate-House conference committee and then  be included in whatever final federal budget plan emerges from ongoing  negotiations. The deadlocked budget for fiscal 1991 is the topic of intense  debate on Capitol Hill and in the White House, leaving the future of the  checkpoint and other federal projects in abeyance.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, California lawmakers who support the checkpoint expansion voiced  confidence Friday that the Senate appropriation gives the $10 million a good  chance of emerging intact from the budget process. Several described the Senate  action as the most significant legislative leap to date for the proposed  facility.  </P> <P> "I think this step means it's going to happen," said David Coggin, press  secretary to U.S. Rep. Ron Packard (R-Oceanside).  </P> <P> Whatever happens, the 16-lane checkpoint is not expected to be operational  until 1995. In addition to the $10 million, federal authorities will have to  seek $20 million in coming years to complete construction. (About $4 million  has already been committed for planning and engineering costs.)  </P> <P> But supporters of the plan maintain that it will be hard for lawmakers to back  out once the $10 million is being spent and construction has begun.  </P> <P> Federal immigration authorities consider the checkpoint a vital enforcement  weapon in turning back the flow of illegal aliens heading to Orange County and  the Los Angeles area along Interstate 5, the region's busiest north-south  artery. The San Clemente checkpoint is the busiest of 30 such Border Patrol  installations from California to Texas, all placed on roads leading from the  Mexican border. The proposed checkpoint station would replace the current one.  </P> <P> In the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, agents based at the checkpoint made a  record 75,000 arrests of undocumented immigrants. Officers also regularly seize  large caches of illicit drugs and other contraband. Authorities say the larger  station is needed to improve efficiency, increase operating hours and reduce  the monumental traffic delays that regularly plague northbound motorists,  sometimes backing them up for more than a mile.  </P> <P> "The existing checkpoint is overwhelmed, outdated and ill-prepared to stop the  thousands of individuals who choose to use I-5 as an artery to circulate drugs,  contraband and illegal aliens throughout the country," Sen. Pete Wilson  (R-Calif.) said Friday in a statement. "With these funds, we can build a  checkpoint that acts more like a red light than a red carpet."  </P> <P> But critics say the checkpoint is a dangerous, risk-laden enterprise that  should be dismantled or at least suspended until safer operating procedures can  be developed. The checkpoint's presence amid the heavily traveled corridor has  contributed to numerous accidents, chases and deaths of undocumented aliens who  attempt to circumvent the facility on foot.  </P> <P> Since the beginning of the year, 12 people have died while trying to cross the  freeway near the checkpoint.  </P> <P> An official for the Coalition for Immigrant Rights and Responsibilities, which  has advocated increased warning signals and a public-awareness campaign  directed at drivers and undocumented workers, said a new checkpoint is only  part of the solution.  </P> <P> "It's a great opportunity for the federal government to design a checkpoint  that can handle what they have to deal with and avoid some of the carnage we  have been experiencing in the last few years," coalition executive director  Lilia Powell said Friday.  </P> <P> She suggested that the federal government help pay for the construction of  grooves in the road and other safety features that have been recommended by the  California Department of Transportation.  </P> <P> Officials from cities near the INS checkpoint -- located five miles south of  the Orange County line on Interstate 5 -- also have objected to the expansion,  contending that the new checkpoint would "trap" more immigrants in nearby  communities that are already trying to cope with large numbers of immigrants.  </P> <P> But in San Clemente, the first city north of the checkpoint, officials have  supported the expansion with the hope of reducing high-speed chases of illegal  immigrants that sometimes end up in their city and endanger bystanders.  </P> <P> "This is fantastic," San Clemente Mayor Candace Haggard said of the Senate  appropriation. "We understand that the Border Patrol has a job to do, but we  have to protect our city."  </P> <P> Haggard added that she favors plans to construct tollbooth-like barriers that  would deter cars from running through the checkpoint. Also, with the new  facility expected to be located three miles south of its current location, the  mayor said the new site combined with increased inspection lanes should help  ease traffic congestion near her city.  </P> <P> After a meeting Friday with immigration officials, the mayor said that until  the new facility is built, the city will help the federal agency pursuade  Caltrans to build walls along the median to prevent undocumented workers from  scurrying across the southbound lanes to escape detection.  </P> <P> Caltrans and the coalition do not support that idea, advocating instead  public-awareness measures and reducing the speed limit near the inspection  lanes.  </P> <P> The present station is a makeshift facility where agents stand on the freeway  and visually inspect passing traffic, directing potential violators to an  inspection area.  </P> <P> The new checkpoint station would be a smaller version of the giant U.S.-Mexico  border crossing some 70 miles to the south. It would be a permanent fixture  accommodating 16 initial inspection lanes and 4 secondary inspection lanes, the  latter for supplemental questioning of motorists. The 15-acre site would  include physical barriers to protect agents, an overhead walkway and expanded  detention, office and parking space.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Robert W. Stewart and Gebe Martinez contributed to this  report.  </P></p>

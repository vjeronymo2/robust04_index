			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, May 27 (TURAN) -- The Russian Foreign  Ministry is continuing its work on a major political agreement  concerning the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict, including  provisions for a ceasefire and discussion about the status of  Nagorno-Karabakh, says the Azeri Embassy in Moscow.    "This agreement will be signed by the Presidents of Russia,  Azerbaijan, and Armenia in Moscow," said the press-secretary of  the Azeri Embassy in Moscow, Farhad Agamalyev. He mentioned  that an agreement was scheduled to be signed by the end of May.  However, the Armenian party demanded a simultaneous discussion  of both the ceasefire and the status of Nagorno-Karabakh. "Such  a proposal contradicts Russian settlement plan. The Russian  Defense Minister, Pavel Grachev, organised a meeting between the  defense ministers of Azerbaijan and Russia and tried to achieve  a ceasefire [as] an important condition for the beginning of  political dialogue at the highest level. Given the situation,  Azeri Defense Minister Mamedov refused to sign the document and  Russia must review the draft of the agreement", said Agamalyev.    Talking about the negative reaction by the Azeri opposition  to the Russian plan, Agamalyev said that "the opposition's  concern is clear, but one has to assess the situation  realistically. The CSCE does not have its own military force  and mechanism which is able to put an end to the fighting in the  region. If we wait for the CSCE, we will further worsen the  situation in the conflict zone and we can loose additional  territories", said the press-secretary.    According to Agamalyev, the meeting between the presidents,  where a major political agreement [as received] is due to take  place in early June.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Yu Shaoliang (0060 4801 5328) and Yang Guojun </F> (2799 0948 6874)]    [Text] Beijing, 18 Mar (XINHUA) -- While taking part in  the discussions held by the Hebei delegation, Liu Huaqing,  member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee  Political Bureau and vice chairman of the Central Military  Commission, said emphatically: In the new situation of deepening  reform and opening up wider to the outside world, party,  government, and military departments in all localities must  further carry out the work of supporting the government and the  army and cherishing the people and of building spiritual  civilization through the joint efforts of the army and the  civilians to guarantee and promote the country's reform and  construction.    Liu Huaqing joined deputies from Hebei today to discuss the  "Government Work Report" and the work reports of the NPC  Standing Committee, the Supreme People's Court, and the Supreme  People's Procuratorate. He said: Strengthening unity between  the army and government and between the military and civilians  is an important element for ensuring the smooth progress of  reform and development. It is also vital to maintaining the  country's political and social stability.    He continued: Past experience shows wherever the work of  "double support" and "building spiritual civilization through  joint efforts" is successful, production will develop faster and  social order will improve. Therefore, we must adopt new ways to  promote the building of spiritual civilization while carrying  out the building of material civilization.    After hearing the speeches of seven other deputies, Liu  Huaqing spoke on the role of agriculture in the national economy  and the reform of state-owned large and medium enterprises. He  pointed out: Party committees and governments at all levels must  pay closer attention to agriculture and rural work, particularly  grain and cotton production. A large country like China cannot  do without sufficient grain and cotton. Agriculture is not  simply a matter of feeding the people; it is also a major issue  vital to China's lasting peace and stability. Currently, we  must do a good job of raising the peasants' farming initiatives  and achieving a relatively comfortable standard of living. In  developing agriculture and promoting the entire rural economy,  we must seek to reduce peasants' burden and give them tangible  benefits.    Speaking about reforming large and medium enterprises, he  said: Among large and medium enterprises, many are old military  industrial enterprises. As the focus of the country's agenda is  shifted onto economic construction, many old military industrial  enterprises have begun to produce civilian goods. In  consideration of the country's needs, we must still retain some  of the essential military enterprises. Relevant departments of  the state are studying measures to help large and medium-sized  military industrial enterprises to overcome their difficulties  after shifting to production of civilian goods. It is hoped  that military industrial enterprises will improve internal  management and make concerted efforts to raise economic benefits  through reform, as other enterprises have done.    Liu Huaqing said: Hebei achieved great success in all fields  of work last year. Not only did its economy developed faster,  but its social atmosphere and public order were also quite good.  Liu Huaqing urged all localities to deepen reform; open up  wider; educate people in patriotism, socialism, and  collectivism; stress the larger interests of the collective and  the state; and work with one heart and one mind to make greater  progress in socialist modernization.</p>

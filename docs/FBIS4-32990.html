			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Carlos F. Chamorro B., director of BARRICADA] </F>   [Text] Both before and after the FSLN's [Sandinist National  Liberation Front] Special Congress took place, secret  discussions on BARRICADA's future were held in political  circles. It is wrongly believed that there is an automatic  correlation between the results of that public event and the  fate of the program already started by this newspaper. I think  this is a mistaken premise and propose an alternative viewpoint  to the reader.    BARRICADA was born as the official mouthpiece of a political  party, the FSLN, and functioned as as partisan institution until  January 1991. After that time, when the FSLN National  Directorate approved its revamping, it became an autonomous  journalistic institution with democratic principles, committed  to serve professional journalism so as to strengthen its  influence on and credibility with society. It autonomy as a  newspaper company is regulated by its Board of Directors and  Editorial Council.    All proposals for change, therefore, must proceed from the  recognition that BARRICADA is not the extension of a partisan  apparatus subject to redefinition along party line's but a  newspaper that is becoming institutionalized and whose own  dynamics constitute the main reference point for its strategy.    The newspaper that has promoted modernization of the press  in  Nicaragua is obligated to be in constant self-review in order to  improve. It is not afraid of changes but rather promotes them,  although it feels they must not be dictated behind the people's  backs or exclude protagonists who make up the newspaper: its  journalists, workers, assistants, etc.    An open, participatory, and public discussion of the  contribution BARRICADA has been making to the overall  democratization of our country is in order. Nicaraguan society  as a whole, and not just one or another faction within the FSLN,  has something to gain or lose, depending on the kind of changes  that are introduced in this newspaper.    Based on experience, I am saying that the option to undo  what  has been done lacks all viability. Without meaning to exhaust  the topic, for the time being I only want to focus on two points  that are indispensable for BARRICADA's continued advance.    a) Sealing a commitment to the reader.    In jest and in earnest, I often tell the newspaper staff  that  our mission is to "not get on anyone's good side except the  reader's."    That commitment to the reader, summarized in the rigorous  effort to report the truth regardless of whether it helps or  harms us politically, is the only thing that can ensure that  BARRICADA will last as an long-term news instituiton.    A newspaper perceived as mirroring the interests of a  pressure group or a faction within that group that establishes  its agenda and the black holes of that agenda has no future in a  democratic society, in a competitive system. It will never go  beyond being a medium for the faithful. It may be formally  combative but will have little effect in its mission of  persuading others.    That is why we must stress with the quality of our daily  work  that our most important commitment -- I repeat, regardless of  our preferences and interests -- is to the reader. It does not  matter what pressures must be faced; we must defend the reader's  right to be well-informed and hear independent opinions.    BARRICADA has made a lot of progress in this field. Its  professional prestige and credibility constitute its greatest  political asset. We are not subject to personal loyalties but  to professional and ethical principles, and that should out of  necessity draw us closer to the reader, producing journalism  that does more good and service to the people each day.    b) National interests and democracy.    BARRICADA's basic commitment to the defense of national  interests entails adopting a clear position in the face of  reality, never a passive or neutral attitude.    That means placing on the national agenda serious problems  like poverty, socioeconomic exclusion, ownership, and the safety  of citizens, and taking sides in solving them from a standpoint  that benefits the low-income majority and makes the viability of  the country possible.    Real scrutiny of public and private powers demands good  journalism that will marshal opinions and actions against public  corruption and also oversee the proper functioning of private  forces, political parties, unions, and social movements in line  with the goals they have announced to society. Nobody should  escape the scrutiny of the press.    Defending the common citizen and his individual rights is  part of a crusade to give voice to those who have no other means  of expressing themselves and does not grant concessions to the  powerful and the state. Supporting just social and mass  struggles is inherent to our principles.    The exercise of journalism from a democratic conviction  entails as an obligation the promotion of a pluralist debate  that helps eradicate the culture of violence and slurs. We  cannnot fall prey to sectarian journalism.    To sow and practice dialogue, tolerance, and respect for the  opinion of minorities constitutes one of the consubstantial  values of democracy. But if we do not acknowledge the rise of  new voices and social protagonists we will engender a debate  limited to the elites.    In addition, we have an unequivocal commitment to face the  lack of participation of this society without which  representative democracy will always be ineffectual in finding a  solution to the major national problems.    These are some of the current editorial challenges facing  BARRICADA that may be summarized in a strong conviction: a  profound transformation in the nation's political culture is  imperative so that democracy can be truly irreversible.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with unidentified aid worker in Rwanda </F> by BEL-RTL journalist Delphine Simon from the studio -- live or  recorded]    [Text] The night has been calm, there is sporadic shooting  now. So far, no European houses have been broken into but some  grenades have exploded against their facades. It appears they  are settling a domestic score. In my conversations with others,  it appears that there are three warring factions in Kigali at  the moment: The presidential guard avenging the president's  assassination; the Rwandan Army trying to restore order; the FPR  [Rwandan Patriotic Front], which has split up from the CND  [National Development Coucil] and intervened in the conflict.  The three parties are firing on each other right now.</p>

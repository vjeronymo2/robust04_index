			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 3 MAKES TARGETED IN HUNTINGTON CAR THEFTS  </P> <P> A wave of thefts against Honda Preludes, Hyundai Excels and Toyota MR2s has  prompted police in Huntington Beach to warn motorists to identify their car  radios, stereos and other removable auto parts.  </P> <P> Forty-five of these vehicles have been stolen so far this year in Huntington  Beach, police said Wednesday. Most are recovered a day or two later but have  been stripped of their seats and stereos. The Hyundais often are missing body  parts and radios, while the Hondas and Toyotas are missing seats and radios.  </P> <P> Most of the equipment is not marked, police say, making it difficult for  authorities to identify stolen property when it is recovered. Police suggest  that owners record serial numbers of their car stereo equipment and write their  driver license number on the fabric of the seats with a laundry marker in an  inconspicuous spot -- such as the leading edge of the cushion.  </P> <P> Scratching the driver license number into the metal framework of the seats or  radio case with an inscribing tool would be better still, police said. Car  owners can arrange to borrow an electronic inscribing tool from the Huntington  Beach Police Department by calling (714) 536-5933.  </P></p>

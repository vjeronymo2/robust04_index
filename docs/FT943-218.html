			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Property: The worst of all worlds - Property cannot escape the pull of bonds The latest monthly bulletin from the Investment Property Databank contains good news and bad news, but not in equal measure. The fractional increase in all-property rental values - the first since 1990  -provides some cheer. But more evidence of rental growth will be required if property prices are to resume their upward march. After 14 months of rising capital values, the all-property index has registered a tiny decline. The fall in capital values will not come as a shock to those at the coalface of the property market. Less inclusive indices than that produced by IPD suggest that capital values stalled in early summer. Surveyor Richard Ellis's index, based on properties totalling Pounds 1bn managed by the firm, showed capital values running out of steam as early as May. Yet a fall in the more broadly-based IPD monthly index adds weight to the argument that the market is facing a widespread downswing rather than isolated local problems. How long this correction lasts probably depends on events in other financial markets. Thanks to the overhang of over-rented properties, the gravitational pull of gilts is especially strong. IPD data suggests that about 44 per cent of all commercial property is currently over-rented. The problem is worse than in previous cycles because nominal rents have fallen so far since the peak in 1990. Even in the dark days of the 1970s, nominal rents in retail and industrial property continued to rise thanks to high inflation. The City of London is the worst afflicted, where 57 per cent of tenants are paying rents above market levels. The degree of over-renting is also greatest in the City. Average rents paid by tenants are more than 50 per cent above levels now being achieved. On these figures, owners of many over-rented buildings can not expect to see income growth from their investment until the end of the decade. In the meantime they have to be content with a fixed income, which makes over-rented property something akin to a corporate bond. Just like a corporate bond, over-rented buildings are priced at yield premium to gilts - to reflect the risk that the tenant will go bust, and the relative lack of liquidity. When gilt prices fall, over-rented property is sure to follow. Moreover, the lag between bond yields starting to rise and property values falling - between four and six months depending on which property index is taken as evidence - suggests that the last quarter of the year could take the edge off returns achieved so far. For property to escape the pull of the bond market, investors have to believe that buildings are something more than fixed-income assets. The latest IPD data on rental values therefore points the way ahead. Again, anecdotal evidence from the market started to show the early signs of rental recovery some time ago. Recent London lettings suggest that rents are already rising - or, at least, incentives are falling - for better-quality office space. Brixton Estate accompanied its interim results this week with a comment that demand for industrial space, in particular, had picked up since the end of the summer. If the pattern of previous cycles is repeated, rents will surely respond across the market before long. 'If the economy continues to grow as it is now, we should have an established pattern of rental growth by this time next year,' said Mr Angus McIntosh, head of research consultancy at Richard Ellis. In the same vein, surveyor Jones Lang Wootton is forecasting 5 per cent rental growth for 1995 and 1996. The lingering worry is that after five years of scaling down, companies are likely to consume less space even during recovery. They will also be more demanding about the kind of space they occupy. Big, old office blocks are likely to remain empty or find tenants only at rents which landlords find bitterly disappointing. Moreover, there is no reason why property should be immune from the deflationary pressures elsewhere in the economy. Companies which are having their margins squeezed in industrial and consumer markets will be loathe to pay more than strictly necessary for space. These are good reasons to believe that rental growth will be subdued for some months yet, and that the bond market will continue to be a decisive influence. Of course, it is possible that the bond yields will fall through the rest of this year and next as investors come to realise that fears about inflation are overdone. Alternatively, bond market investors could be proved right by a resurgence of inflation, which would help solve the problem of over-renting. For the moment, though, the market will have to live with the worst of all possible worlds: rising bond yields and no sign of inflationary growth.</p>

This proposed rule: changes CMA bylaw requirements to reflect current CMA organizational and operational procedures; requires approved cotton CMA retention of services provided by servicing agent banks; requires approved CMA monitoring of payments they receive on behalf of their members to ensure that member payments do not exceed payment limits; and makes other administrative changes. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Written comments must be received on or before September 30, 1994 in order to be assured of consideration. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Send comments to Director, Cotton, Grain, and Rice Price Support Division, Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), P.O.

The amendments to 7 CFR part 1425 set forth in this proposed rule impose new or revised information collection requirements in monitoring the application of statutory payment limitation provisions to members of CMA when the CMA participates in CCC price support program on behalf of their members. ASCS will submit an addendum to OMB to revise the information collection supporting statement for OMB No. 0560&hyph;0040.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public reporting burden for all collections is estimated to average from 1 to 2 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and competing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to the Department of Agriculture, Clearance Officer, OIRM, P.O. Box 7630, Washington, DC 20250&hyph;0001; and to the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (OMB No. 0560&hyph;0040), Washington, DC 20503.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> CMA participation in CCC price support programs on behalf of their members must be approved by CCC. When approved, a CMA may participate in price support programs in much the same way as individual producers. The regulations at 7 CFR part 1425 contain the requirements for CMA participation. This proposed rule amends those requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a previous amendment, canola, flaxseed, mustard seed, rapeseed, safflower, and sunflower seed were added to the list of authorized commodities for which a CMA may apply for price support. However, these additional commodities were inadvertently omitted from &sect;1425.3(d). This proposed rule revises &sect;1425.3(d) by adding these commodities to the list of authorized commodities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulations are being prepared to authorize price support for shorn mohair and shorn wool to individual producers. This proposed rule adds these commodities to the list of authorized commodities for an approved CMA in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;1425.3(d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule adds a new &sect;1425.3(i) to provide that an approved CMA may receive loan deficiency payments, when applicable, on behalf of its members. This reflects an earlier decision to allow an approved CMA to obtain loan deficiency payments on behalf of its members in the same way individual producers participate in price support.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule defines, by reference, the terms ``person'' and ``producer'' by amending redesignated &sect;1425.3(j) and (k) using the definitions contained in part 1413 of this title. These are the same definitions used for individual producers participating in various price support programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule revises &sect;1425.4(a) to indicate that a CMA must apply to ``participate in a price support program'' as defined in added &sect;1425.3(i).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule revises &sect;1425.4(b)(7) to change the reference from &sect;1425.17 to &sect;1425.18.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CMA annual recertification requirement is currently contained in the title to &sect;1425.5(c). This proposed rule places that requirement in the text of &sect;1425.4(c). An approved CMA may alter its organizational structure or operations after its initial approval in such a way to affect compliance with this regulation. This proposed rule adds &sect;1425.4(e) to require an approved CMA to resubmit complete ``initial'' applications every 5 years, or more often, as required by CCC. The information submitted will be used to evaluate the continued compliance with these regulations by each approved CMA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Other nations echo complaint OTHER reactions to President Bush's announcement echoed Australia's dissatisfaction: THE EC: An official described the move as 'belligerent', asking if increasing farm support was compatible with the joint EC-US pledge to secure a Uruguay Round deal, David Gardner reports from Brussels. No wheat programme had been mentioned at talks this week between Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, and Mr Frans Andriessen, EC external affairs commissioner, he added. But Brussels seemed to be pulling its punches, adhering to the informal truce agreed with the US on bilateral farm trade disputes, in the hope of getting an overall Gatt settlement before the end of the year. CANADA: Ottawa will try to protect its grain markets, Mr Charles Mayer, grains and oilseeds minister, said, Reuter reports from Ottawa. He called the US action a unilateral move lowering world grain prices. 'It is like hitting a fly with a hammer'. It would hit everybody, driving down their prices, he declared. Canada might have been willing to co-operate with the US, Australia and Argentina to try to stem the war with Europe over markets, but the US had acted unilaterally. It was an election year (in the US), and if Washington had wanted to talk about the Europeans, 'it would have been better to talk with us to see if we could do something, but they gave no indications at all. It's like getting into a fight with a skunk: everyone comes out smelling.' BRAZIL: The foreign ministry yesterday confirmed Brazil would not buy the 500,000 tonnes of subsidised wheat offered by the US, Christina Lamb reports from Brasilia. The decision calmed the fears of Argentina which since 1986 has replaced the US as Brazil's main wheat supplier. This year Brazil is expected to buy 2m tonnes of Argentine wheat under Mercosur, the free trade zone formed last year between Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay. Brazilian diplomats said they were keeping 'an open line' with Buenos Aires. Brazil wants to avoid further strain with its Mercosur partners, already worried that its huge economic and political problems could make the agreement collapse. ARGENTINA: The government was 'surprised' and 'displeased' by the US decision, John Barham reports from Buenos Aires. Argentina has seen its wheat exports plunge to Dollars 525.6m (Pounds 264m) last year from Dollars 1.47bn in 1981, due largely to EC and US subsidies. Mr Alieto Guadagni, international economic relations secretary, said farm subsidies now cost Argentina Dollars 1.2bn-Dollars 1.5bn a year in lost export revenues. He had not yet worked out the impact of the new US subsidies, but believed Argentina was 'satisfied' by Brazil's decision not to buy subsidised wheat. Last year, Brazil angered Argentina by importing subsidised US wheat.</p>

			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIES OF THE WEEK  </P> <P> Helen Shaver stars in the new TV movie Mothers, Daughters and Lovers (NBC  Sunday at 9 p.m.) as a single working mother trying to make a decent life for  herself and her two daughters, despite the burning desire of the eldest  daughter (Laura Perry) to leave their small town. Claude Akins co-stars.  </P> <P> Thunderboat Row (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.), another new TV movie, finds Chad  Everett and Jason Adams in an action-adventure involving law enforcers using a  new high-speed boat to catch drug smugglers off the Florida coast.  </P> <P> Love Child (Channel 13 Monday at 8 p.m.), the 1982 film that marked Amy  Madigan's theatrical film debut, always seemed better scaled for TV. Madigan is  excellent as a pregnant Florida convict, determined to keep her unborn child,  and so is Beau Bridges as the likable but unscrupulous guard she refuses to  identify as the child's father.  </P> <P> Report to the Commissioner (Channel 13 Tuesday at 8 p.m.), a violent,  farfetched but fast and pungently atmospheric 1975 thriller set in Manhattan,  stars Michael Moriarty as a distraught rookie cop assigned to undercover work  on the Times Square narc beat.  </P> <P> CBS repeats The Man in the Brown Suit (Tuesday at 9 p.m.), a diverting Agatha  Christie mystery starring Stephanie Zimbalist as the adventure-hungry heroine,  Anne Beddingfield.  </P> <P> Robert De Niro won an Oscar as boxer Jake La Motta in Martin Scorsese's Raging  Bull (Channel 5 Wednesday at 8 p.m.), one of the best films of the decade. De  Niro's La Motta is in the classic mold: the street kid who came up from  nothing, caught the brass ring and lost it, largely through ungovernable rage  and jealousy.  </P> <P> Fire and Rain (USA Network Wednesday at 9 p.m.) is a new cable TV movie that  dramatizes the crash of a Delta Airlines flight at the Dallas/Ft. Worth Airport  in 1985. The cast includes Tom Bosley, Robert Guillaume, Susan Ruttan and David  Hasselhoff.  </P> <P> Tough Enough (Channel 5 Thursday at 8 p.m.) is a delightful, modest little  piece of Americana starring Dennis Quaid as a struggling country  singer-composer who in desperation enters a Toughman Contest, one of those  amateur boxing contests. Written by John Leone and directed by Richard  Fleischer, this 1983 release is a surprising, subtle and amusing consideration  of the seductiveness of the pursuit of macho.  </P> <P> Zoot Suit (Channel 11 Thursday at 8 p.m.), Luis Valdez's 1981 film of his play,  is not as exciting as it was on stage but is just as important. At once an  exuberant period musical and seething courtroom drama in which the ugliest  prejudice is laid bare, it stars Edward James Olmos as the ultimate mythical  zoot-suiter El Pachuco.  </P> <P> Under Norman Jewison's direction, Sylvester Stallone is terrific as a Jimmy  Hoffa carbon in F.I.S.T. (Channel 5 Friday at 8 p.m.).  </P> <P> Charley Varrick (Channel 13 Friday at 8 p.m.) is that delicious teaming of  director Don Siegel and Walter Matthau as a canny, deliberately small-time bank  robber.  </P> <P> In The Heist (HBO Saturday at 8 p.m.), a new made-for-cable movie, Pierce  Brosnan plays an ex-con who plans the robbery of a San Diego race track to get  revenge on his double-crossing partner (Tom Skerritt).  </P> <P> Luis Puenzo's The Official Story (Channel 28 Saturday at 10 p.m.), named best  foreign film of 1985, is a riveting account of an elegant woman (the  electrifying Norma Aleandro) who begins to suspect she may not be as sheltered  from the horrors of Argentina's military regime as she thought.  </P> <P> The ratings checks on movies in the TV log are provided by the Tribune TV Log  listings service.  </P> <P> Selected Evening  </P></p>

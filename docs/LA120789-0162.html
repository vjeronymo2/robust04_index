			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Bluff Cove conflict -- A story on Oct. 29 in the South Bay section of The Times  about conflicts between surfers and jet skiers at Bluff Cove incorrectly said  that Pat Hulett, president of the San Pedro-based Class A Boating Assn., had  jet skied there. Hulett has surfed in the cove.  </P> <P> The story also incorrectly described an arrangement at Cabrillo Beach in San  Pedro. Under a self-policing program there, jet skiers observe a 5-m.p.h. speed  limit in marked areas close to shore.  </P></p>

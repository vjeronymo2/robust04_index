			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 19 (XINHUA) -- President Muhammed  Husni Mubarak's forthcoming visit to China will serve to promote  the friendly ties of cooperation between Egypt and China.    Egyptian Ambassador to China Samir Burhan expressed this  belief in an interview with XINHUA.    President Mubarak will start a three-day state visit to  China  on April 21 at the invitation of Chinese President Jiang Zemin.    Burhan noted that a Cairo earthquake two years ago disrupted  Mubarak's China trip and the forthcoming visit would be an  extension of that visit.    The frequent high-level exchanges of visits are  "manifestations of the friendly ties" between the two countries,  he said.    During the visit, Mubarak is scheduled to hold talks and  exchange views with President Jiang on regional and  international issues of mutual concern.    Mubarak will brief the Chinese leadership on the latest  developments of the Middle East peace process, and Egypt's role  in the negotiations between the Palestine Liberation  Organization and Israel and the withdrawal of Israeli troops  from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho, Burhan  said.    As chairman of the Organization of African Unity, Mubarak  will also brief the Chinese leaders on the developments in hot  spots in Africa, such as Rwanda, Burundi, Somalia, Mozambique  and South Africa.    Leaders of the two countries will explore new ways to  enhance  bilateral ties, especially those in the economic and trade  fields, and propel these ties toward a new phase of development,  Burhan said.    The ambassador touched on Egypt-China economic and trade  relations, saying that the two-way trade volume reached 200  million U.S. dollars last year.    "The figure is not all that big and there exists great  potential for development," he said.    He voiced the belief that President Mubarak's visit will  also  serve to expand bilateral economic and trade relations.    Burhan revealed that the two countries are working on an  agreement on judicial cooperation for the president to sign  during his visit here. "This will mark another new development  in bilateral cooperation," he noted.    Egypt and China share similar experiences in their  respective  opening drives and economic re-working, and are faced with  common difficulties, he said.    The exchange of these experiences will help them to solve  obstacles and to promote each country's progress, the ambassador  noted.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Madhu Nainan] </F>   [Text] Bombay, Jan 17 (AFP) -- Police braced for more  trouble Monday [17 Jan] in Maharashtra as a militant Hindu  leader planned to tour areas of the state hit by rioting over  the renaming of a university after a crusader of India's  untouchables.    Sporadic violence continued for a third day in eight of the  western state's 30 districts where arson and rioting snowballed  after the Maharashtra administration renamed a unversity after  the leader of low-caste Hindus.    High-caste Hindus outraged by the move on Monday set ablaze  an engineering workshop, a dam site and several schools in  Parbani district and torched a government veterinary hospital in  Jalna district, witnesses said.    The attackers hurled rocks at state buses and private cars,  forcing vehicles off the roads. Several Hindu and Buddhist  temples also came under attack as tension rose in the eight  districts torn by caste-strife, witnesses said.    Train and bus services remained disrupted because of attacks  by upper-caste Hindus protesting the renaming of Marathwada  university after Baba Sahib Ambedkar, leader of the  socially-oppressed low-caste Hindus.    Police stepped up patrols to prevent violence from spilling  into new areas.    Police also prepared to block a visit later Monday by Hindu  fundamentalist leader Bal Thackeray to the city of Aurangabad,  site of the rechristened university.    Thackeray is the leader of the Shiv Sena, whose members have  been at the forefront of the violence which erupted Friday [14  Jan] after Maharashtra chief minister Sharad Pawar renamed the  university.    Police said they had blocked all entry points to Aurangabad  to ensure that Thackeray does not reach the city. They have  banned the visit by the firebrand Hindu leader, amid fears it  would spark large-scale unrest.    "Nobody is above the law," senior police officer Mahesh  Narayan Singh said when asked whether Thackeray would be  arrested. He also asserted that there was no violence on Monday  in Marathwada district.    On Sunday, Shiv Sena militants and upper-caste Hindus  torched  a veterinary hospital, a police station, two schools and a Dalit  shanty town and attacked government buses and offices in  Marathwada.    No casualties were reported in the attacks.    Shiv Sena sources said Thackeray plans to lead a rally  Tuesday in Aurangabad to protest the renaming of Marathwada  university after the author of the Indian constitution.    Ambedkar is lionised by lower-caste Hindus, who are called  Dalits or "downtrodden" -- those at the lowest rung of the Hindu  caste ladder.    If Thackeray is arrested, Shiv Sena activists would fan out  into villages to carry out "disruptive activities," sources in  his party said.    A journalist meanwhile swallowed poison and died in the town  of Yawat Mal on Sunday [16 Jan], leaving behind a suicide note  that said he was taking his life to protest at the renaming of  the university.    Vinod Gudge was the first person to commit suicide to  protest  the renaming.    Another protestor set himself on fire in Beed district but  survived with burns to 80 percent of his body, the MAHRASHTRA  TIMES said.    Five "Dalits" had committed suicide to force the renaming of  the university.    The outbreak of inter-caste violence is India's worst since  1990, when the then premier, V.P. Singh, hiked job quotas for  the lower castes.</p>

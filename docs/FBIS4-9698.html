			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Adela Leal] </F>   [Excerpt] The views expressed in Congress suggest that the  proposal to dissolve the National Congress which was made by  Causa R [Radical Cause] Deputy Pablo Medina will not succeed, at  least through legal means. The proposal has been considered by  some supporters of President Caldera, in case the present  Parliament might make a regular practice of blocking government  policies.    The opinions expressed by some legislators from different  political groups suggest that a hypothetical dissolution of the  legislative chambers, through a constitutional reform, will be  rejected.    The views expressed agree that a decision like the one  proposed should not be considered in terms of its application to  the present Congress, but rather as a general standard  applicable in specific circumstances of Venezuela's national  life.    One of those holding this view is Segundo Melendez, head of  the MAS [Movement Toward Socialism] parliamentary group. In his  opinion, a circumstance of the kind proposed should be  established in the Constitution in a very clear and precise  manner. In addition, it should respond to a structural situation  related to the state's operation, so that political situations  that might arise during a parliamentary term could be resolved  by constitutional means.    But calling for such a step because this Congress or any  other Congress might be in a crisis situation that requires the  application of a constitutional regulation which does not exist,  but which needs to be discussed at that time, is a mistake.    He cited the need to debate the reform of the  Constitution--if this long-awaited debate actually takes  place--"in the abstract," on the basis of major general problems  in order to develop a response to those general problems. If  later they are applicable to this or to any other Parliament, in  specific circumstances, that is a different matter. But there  already exists a mechanism to deal with the situation that has  now arisen.  <H5>  A Detailed Analysis </H5>   Pablo Medina, deputy and secretary general of Causa R,  though, using an "innovative interpretation" of the  Constitution, invokes Article 4 of the Constitution, which  states that sovereignty resides in the people and is exercised  through the ballot. He believes that the people, through a  referendum, can dissolve the present Congress which he calls  "worthless" because, in his view, many of the people in Congress  got there through electoral fraud.    However, in his proposal, Deputy Medina seems not to  [correctly] interpret the general spirit of this clause which,  while it does indeed state that sovereignty resides in the  people, makes it very clear that the people exercise this  sovereignty by voting for the organs of public authority, one of  which is the legislative branch. Therefore, any dissolution must  be made through a constitutional reform or by the use of force.  [passage omitted]</p>

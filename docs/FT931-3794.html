			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / How To Spend It: Pulling the rug from under your feet . . .  -Lucia van der Post keeps her nose to the ground in search of carpets - and finds some which are simply too interesting to go on the floor they are an art-form, beautiful, useful, and, once hooked, collecting them becomes a life-long obsession. Buying rugs is fraught with traps for the ignorant or the unwary but for those who long to know more about them Alastair Hull and Jose Luczyc-Wychowska have just produced a sumptuously illustrated book - Kilim, The Complete Guide (Thames and Hudson, Pounds 36) - which looks at their history and origins, and the varying techniques and designs that go to make them up. Besides being a visual guide to the multifarious designs found in these beautiful flat-weave carpets, questions such as how to collect and care for them and where to find a dealer have been addressed. Anyone embarking on even the simplest purchase would do well to buy this book first. When it comes to buying rugs it is as well to define what you really want. Those, for instance, who are looking for attractive, affordable floor-coverings rather than rare works of art might like to know about David and Sarah Richardson who have set up a carpet shop in Sussex (26 Southgate, Chichester. Tel: 0243-533025). They specialise in offering well-made, affordable modern rugs. They do get the occasional antique and are always happy to look out for special pieces for customers but the bulk of their stock is modern rugs from Turkey, Persia and Afghanistan. They buy directly From Turkey to keep the prices as low as possible and all the rugs are made in the traditional way, hand-woven, hand-knotted, from good quality wool using natural dyes. Some are slightly sun-faded as the current taste runs to colourways that are gentler than the dyes. The Richardsons buy from three main carpet-producing areas - Dosemealti (lots of reds, blues and bottle greens with touches of ochre), Kars (in the Armenian part of Turkey where the rugs are based on old Caucasian designs - very bold but in soft, rather pastel colours as in the rug photographed below right and Milas in Anatolia (here designs are often based on stylised tree-of-life motifs or flowering diamonds within a prayer-mat format). You could buy a small rug (4 ft by 2 1/2 ft) for about Pounds 110 while for about Pounds 400 you could find a a 7 x 5. Apart from the rugs, the Richardsons sell kilim covered furniture, everything from footstools (starting at about Pounds 110) to sofas. When in Turkey they buy worn rugs and always have a supply so that customers can choose something to suit their own schemes. Another supplier worth knowing about is Christopher Legge Oriental Carpets, of 25 Oakthorpe Road, Summertown, Oxford. He is the chap to go to for old tribal and village rugs, whether Hamadans, Belouches, Afghans, Q'ashgais, Turkomans or Caucasians. Like everybody else, though, he has found the supply of quality old rugs dwindling and he also sells top-class modern rugs such as Gabbehs from Iran and those made under the Dobag project in Turkey (Dobag being a government initiative to reintroduce traditional methods of weaving and dying). Prices range from small mats costing between Pounds 40 and Pounds 50 and a large old piece selling for Pounds 5,000. In between you could find a 3 ft 4 in by 2 ft 5 in rug for Pounds 195, a 5 ft by 3 ft 7 in for Pounds 395 and an 11 ft by 7 ft for Pounds 2,500. Christopher Legge will also clean and restore. Cleaning costs Pounds 35 a rug up to 24 sq ft and thereafter 50p per sq ft (plus vat). Stothert Kilim Covering is not so much a source of kilims, more a place to go for kilim-covered furniture. A wonderful way of using rugs that are too old or frayed to survive underfoot, Stothert will use any of your own pieces for covering cushions, pouffes, sofas, stools or chairs. For those who do not happen to have any dilapidated rugs Stothert is also offering all his designs covered in his own kilims. As you can see from the photograph here (bottom right) the pouffes make exceedingly attractive portable informal seating and doubles as an informal table, as well, somewhere useful to store the magazines or newspapers, hold the cup of coffee or rest the legs. Kilim cushions start at Pounds 14.30 for the smallest and go on up to Pounds 56 for the largest, the pouffes start at Pounds 105 for the 18 in by 12 in high size and up to Pounds 285 for the largest, 34 in by 14 in. Equivalent prices if you supply your own kilim (or indeed any other fabric, for kilims are not obligatory) are Pounds 92 and Pounds 124. Armchairs are Pounds 725, while two-seater sofas are Pounds 1,300. For those who have had enough of kilims, it is worth knowing that Stothert also offers a range of tartan cushions, neatly finished and piped for prices starting at Pounds 14.30. Stothert Kilim Covering operates from Saltcote House, Glasson Dock, Lancaster LA2 OBS. Tel: 0524-844078. Finally, if you have a rug or carpet, no matter how modest, that is showing signs of wear and tear, that has suffered the usual fate of carpets in households where real-life goes on, then you might like to know about Behar Profex. A family business started some 80 years ago, it cleans, renovates and restores. While it does a lot of grand work, restoring treasured heirlooms and valuable museum pieces (English Heritage, the National Trust, Christie's and Sotheby's are all customers) it is equally happy to take on pieces of more modest lineage. The company will do everything from a simple cleaning job to a full-scale restoration; it has restored a rug nibbled by mice, and removed stains from a collection of Turkish rugs stained by flooding. Prices vary according to rug size and complexity of work but the starting price for cleaning a small rug would be about Pounds 50. Contact Behar Profex at The Alban Building, St Albans Place, Upper Street, London N1. Tel: 071-226-0144.</p>

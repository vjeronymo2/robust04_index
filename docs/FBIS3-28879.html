			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, February 11 (KCNA) -- The central  guidance committee of the Korean Chondoists Association in a  statement today vehemently denounced the Kim Yong-sam group for  blocking the patriotic initiative and contact of Chondoists in  the North and the South to jointly celebrate the centenary of  the historical Kabo Peasant War in 1894, branding its tricky  move as an unpardonable fascist outrage of the treacherous  regime that claims to be "civilian", as an anti-national  criminal act against independence, democracy and reunification.    The statement said the "nuclear problem" raised by the Kim  Yong-sam group with the aim of blocking a contact between  representatives of Chondoists in the North and the South and  frustrating a joint celebration of the centenary of the Kabo  Peasant War is a shameless sophism that can convince no one.    "Impermissible is any act of trampling upon the patriotic  intention of the Chondoists in the North and the South, and the  Kim Yong-sam puppet group which is engaged in flunkeyist  treacheries and nation-splitting moves must be removed in South  Korea at an early date," said the statement.    It held that the patriotic initiative of the Chondoists in  the North and the South to celebrate the centennal of the 1894  Kabo Peasant War as a common festival of the nation in keeping  with the expectation and hope of all the fellow countrymen must  be realized under all circumstances.    It expressed the hope that the South Korean Chondoists would  discard any illusion about the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime and  actively turn out in the struggle to sweep away the group of  traitors by the united efforts of the whole nation like the  forerunners and martyrs who participated in the Kabo Peasant  War, and would more vigorously fight to bring the joint  celebration of the centenary of the war to a success.</p>

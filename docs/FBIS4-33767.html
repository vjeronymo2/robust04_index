			<p>BFN     [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 10 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The heads  of state or government of Latin America, Spain, and Portugal  reject economic blockades that negatively affect any country in  the region, according to the draft of the Fourth Ibero-American  Summit Declaration.    According to this document, to which NOTIMEX had access, the  leaders will repudiate "any measure that affects free commercial  development, goes against international legal principles, and  worsens the people's living conditions." Although the final  document does not make a direct reference to the Cuban or  Haitian situation, it does describe the economic blockade as  "incompatible with the current international economic and  political situation."    The heads of state or government who will participate in the  summit that is to be held in this Colombian city on Tuesday and  Wednesday of next week, manifest their support for the UN  resolution that demands the elimination of this type of measure.  The first part of the document refers to commerce and  integration as factors that further Ibero-American development  and recommends the adoption of macroeconomic reforms, as well as  the strengthening of the business sector.    The participants also propose that restrictive commercial  practices be eliminated and underscore their commitment to  multilateralism and commercial opening. Cooperation and mutual  assistance, including the exchange of information, are  considered indispensable for countries in the region to adapt to  the new international order, according to the text. In order to  overcome the obstacles that prevent a greater level of  competition in interregional and international commerce, the  heads of state or government will recommend that preferential  treatment be granted to less developed countries.    At the meeting, which will be inaugurated by host President  Cesar Gaviria next Tuesday, they will propose that the  government's role in several countries be redefined and that  priority be given to the rationing of expenses in other  countries. This recommendation, mentioned in the 15-page  document, aims to promote having the governments in the area  concentrate their efforts in strategic areas, such as education  and health, for the well-being of their people.    After evaluating the Ibero-American forum's development --  its first meeting was held in Guadalajara, in the western  Jalisco State of Mexico, on July 1991 -- the participants will  propose that a work method be established for future summits.  The proposal's objective is for statements to concentrate on a  specific area so as to avoid having another long list of topics  that are frequently unconnected and incomplete," in the next  summit, scheduled to be held in Argentina in 1995.

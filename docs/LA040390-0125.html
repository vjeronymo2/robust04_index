			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> LEBANON'S AOUN CALLS FOR ARAB HELP ON PEACE  </P> <P> Lebanon's Christian Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, who rejected a 1989 Arab-brokered  peace plan for his civil-war-torn nation, has urged Arab leaders to find a new  deal satisfactory to all parties, officials said Monday.  </P> <P> Aoun, commander of half of Lebanon's army, has written to the leaders of Saudi  Arabia, Morocco, Algeria and to the Arab League about a peace pact, the  officials said.  </P> <P> The 1989 accord divided power between Christian Maronites and the Muslim  majority. But it failed to include a clear timetable for a Syrian withdrawal  from Lebanon, which was cited by Aoun as his main reason for rejecting it.  </P></p>

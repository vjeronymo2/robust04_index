			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS corresponedents Viktor Demidenko and </F> Mikhail Melnik]    [Text] Notv, 1 May -- Aleksandr Moroz (Socialist Party),  candidate for the Ukrainian presidency, is categorically against  postponing the date for electing the head of state: I will do  everything to have the election take place on the scheduled  date, he told ITAR-TASS in an interview today.    You will recall that Leonid Kravchuk has appealed to  parliament with an initiative to transfer the date of the  presidential election from 26 June to a later date. This was  supported the other day by 120 deputies in the Supreme Council.    Combining with the communists and the Peasants' Party in a  single bloc, the Socialist Party now has 36 percent of the seats  in parliament. If it is remembered that Ukrainian communist  leader Petr Symonenko gave up his presidential candidacy the  other day, then Aleksandr Morozov has a substantial chance of  winning in the presidential marathon; but for this to happen he  needs to collect 100,000 voters' signatures for his initial  official registration as candidate for the post of president.</p>

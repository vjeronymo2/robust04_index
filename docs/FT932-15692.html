			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan holds its gains in brisk trade MILAN, open along with Brussels and Istanbul yesterday, managed once again to set Italy's political scandals aside, writes Our Markets Staff. MILAN's Comit index rose another 2.08 to 512.09, a rise of 7.7 per cent on the week. Brokers said that turnover was surprisingly high, boosted by Thursday's government restatement of its determination to move on privatisation, and by final cabinet approval of the law on private pensions. Among banks, one privatisation candidate, BCI, closed some L93 higher at L4,695, but Credito Italiano slipped L35 to L2,710 as treasury statements on Thursday were perceived as indicating that there will not be a public offer of the shares. BRUSSELS closed the shortened, pre-holiday session with the Bel-20 index 4.65 lower at 1,260.47. Business was concentrated mainly in blue chip stocks but the big holding company, Societe Generale de Belgique, barely reacted to late Thursday's announcement of a 38 per cent rise in 1992 earnings, closing BFr10 higher at BFr2,325. ISTANBUL's market index swung between an early high of 6,914 and a low of 6,645 before bouncing up on late support to end 16.66 higher at a new all-time high close of 6,754.11, 7.1 per cent higher on the week. On Thursday, PARIS saw early gains obliterated by the absence of any easing from the Bank of France, and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's remark that he was considering raising indirect taxes to balance the social security system's accounts. The CAC-40 index finished just 2.90 higher at 1,986.86, 0.2 per cent lower on the week. Turnover was healthier at FFr3.23bn. Michelin rose FFr3.70 to FFr168.80 on short covering, more than recovering Wednesday's losses on a profits warning. However, L'Oreal, France's largest cosmetics company, looked on safer ground with a FFr33 gain at FFr1,146 after Wednesday's late news of a 16 per cent gain in profits. FRANKFURT recovered, the DAX index closing 5.42 higher at 1,655.73, 0.3 per cent down on the week, in turnover down from DM5.6bn to DM4.6bn. BMW rose DM7.50 to DM484.50, and Volkswagen by DM3 to DM311, as Daimler recovered only DM1.20 to DM565 for a DM45.50, or 7.5 per cent drop on the week. Mr Cord Suerie at Paribas Capital Markets said, however, that Paribas maintained its buy rating on Daimler, remaining quite optimistic for the group following its US listing. Lufthansa rose DM4.30 to DM112, picking up on the excitement among airline stocks elsewhere in Europe. ZURICH edged higher, the 3.4 gain to 2,188.3 in the SMI index leaving it little changed on the week. Swissair bearers rose SFr35, or 5.8 per cent to SFr630 after the airline claimed at Wednesday's annual press conference to be taking the initiative in talks about an alliance with KLM, SAS and Austrian Airlines. Analysts believe that any such link would provide substantial potential for further cost cutting, and that it would open up a much larger market for the Swiss group. AMSTERDAM saw foreign demand as the CBS Tendency index edged 0.4 higher to 107.9, 1 per cent up on the week. Heineken, an outperformer being reassessed by investors, shed Fl 2.40 to Fl 188.50 after Wednesday's flat 1992 earnings and profits warning. Unilever lost another Fl 1.60 to Fl 204.80 in response to lower earnings estimates from London brokers. KLM picked up Fl 1.30 to Fl 29.40 and Philips, finding renewed demand from US investors, added 70 cents to Fl 25.30. Bursumij Wehry, the trading company, rose Fl 3.80 or 4.6 per cent to a year's high of Fl 86 ahead of its annual report on Tuesday. The stock has risen by Fl 15, or 21 per cent since March 16 when the company reported higher 1992 net profits and forecast an improvement in 1993 earnings. DUBLIN extended Wednesday's gains, the ISEQ overall index closing up 16.68 on the day at 1,522.44, 1.8 per cent better on the week. Mr Robbie Kelleher of Davy Stockbrokers said that the continuing fall in money market rates had brought foreign buyers back into the market after some profit-taking and that moderately sized companies like Avonmore and Waterfood, in the food business, and Independent Newpapers had taken over from the biggest blue chips at the top of the performance charts.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- April 8                                             THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes           Open       10.30       11.00       12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1151.15     1150.97     1151.32     1152.12 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1210.22     1210.93     1210.49     1211.47  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes          13.00       14.00       15.00       Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1151.68     1151.87     1152.56     1151.40 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1210.54     1211.29     1211.22     1211.28  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Apr 7     Apr 6     Apr 5     Apr 2     Apr 1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1144.36   1147.43   1136.15   1140.36   1144.81 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1206.25   1210.05   1202.24   1215.52   1219.86  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1153.46; 200 - 1213.25 Low/day: 100 - 1150.60  200 - 1209.54.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / FT Conference on International Banking: European merger wave predicted A WAVE of mergers is likely to sweep through the banking and insurance sectors of several European countries with the onset of the single European market, a Financial Times conference in London on international banking was told yesterday. Mr Jurgen Lemmer, deputy member of the board of managing directors of Commerzbank, said mergers in Spain, the Netherlands, Austria and Scandinavia had already changed the list of the biggest banks in those countries. This would soon be the case in Italy, too, and there were signs of mergers between the public-sector Landesbanks in Germany. 'Up to now the banking industry has not produced any institutions with a prominent position through Europe as a whole. The market share of the largest, Credit Agricole or Deutsche Bank, is barely more than 2 per cent. By contrast the largest carmakers, Volkswagen and Fiat, each account for about 15 per cent of the western European market,' Mr Lemmer said. Sir Peter Middleton, chairman of BZW, the securities and investment arm of Barclays Bank, said he believed that the rules and system of regulation governing investment banking were adequate. He said it was a perverse result of improved regulation rather than slackening standards that markets were trusted less today than in the past.</p>

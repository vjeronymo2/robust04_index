			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> ZSA ZSA CURSED, SLAPPED, SCREAMED AND SPAT IN RAGE, OFFICER TELLS JURY  </P> <P> An enraged Zsa Zsa Gabor cursed a Beverly Hills policeman for stopping her  Rolls-Royce, slapped him hard enough to bend his sunglasses, screamed, "Do you  know who I am?" and "spit a little bit" during a traffic stop, the officer  testified today.  </P> <P> "She closed the door and she spun around and slapped me on the side of the  face. I was very surprised," 6-foot, 4-inch motorcycle officer Paul Kramer  testified during Gabor's trial in Municipal Court.  </P> <P> Kramer was the first prosecution witness as testimony began in what both sides  agreed is a trial about "arrogance and insolence."  </P> <P> "The evidence will show this is a case about arrogance, impudence, insolence,  disrespect and disregard for law by the defendant on June 14, 1989," Deputy  Dist. Atty. Elden Fox said in his opening statement.  </P> <P> Defense attorney William Greysen agreed in part. "This case is about arrogance  and insolence. It's about the arrogance and insolence of Officer Kramer."  </P> <P> Gabor was obviously on edge during the officer's testimony, frequently  whispering to her attorney, "That's not true."  </P></p>

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / International Company News: Recovery at Bank of Boston BANK OF BOSTON, which last week ended merger talks with Shawmut National Bank, yesterday unveiled a fourth-quarter net profit of Dollars 93.5m, a figure that underscores the bank's claim that it is on the mend after heavy losses in the first half of last year. The fourth-quarter profit contrasts with a Dollars 186.7m loss in the last quarter of 1990, and is an improvement on the Dollars 18m net profit in the third quarter of 1991. For the whole of 1991, Bank of Boston was still in the red, suffering a Dollars 26.6m loss, which compares with a Dollars 394.5m deficit in 1990. The bank's bad debt provisions in the fourth quarter of 1991 were Dollars 78m, much lower than the Dollars 170m recorded in the same period of 1990. For the whole of 1991 the bank's bad debt provisions totalled Dollars 328m, down from Dollars 620m in 1990. Non-performing loans were also down to Dollars 1.5bn at year-end, a 17 per cent drop year-on-year. The bank has undergone a significant restructuring over the past year. Yesterday the Bank of Boston share price closed at Dollars 14 3/8 , up by 1/2 .</p>

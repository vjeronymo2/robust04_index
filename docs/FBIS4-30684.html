			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa by </F> Jean-Pierre Langellier and Philippe Pons in Tokyo; date not  given: "`We Can Make a Positive Contribution' Within the UN  Security Council"]    [Text] [LE MONDE] Following the announcement of a summit  between the presidents of the two Koreas, you expressed a  certain skepticism on the results of such a meeting. Why?    [Kakizawa] I am not totally skeptical. We are in favor of  the initiative. It is a constructive proposal. But I do not  share the optimism of those who say that the issue has now been  resolved. Further details are required concerning the agreement  reached between the U.S. and North Korean leaders. There are  still ambiguous or vague points which must be cleared up. For  example, what exactly is meant by "freezing" the nuclear  program? Similarly, with regard to the guarantees, do the  promises made to the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency]  also involve the reprocessing installations to which Pyongyang  has so far denied access? These are fundamental questions.    [LE MONDE] The Japanese press reports that Prime Minister  Hata declared that "North Korea probably has no nuclear weapons"  and that its refusal to grant inspections of its nuclear sites  is due to "a desire not to succumb to external blackmail." Do  you share this opinion?    [Kakizawa] That is not the idea Mr. Hata was seeking to  express. He simply pointed out that President Kim Il-song  stated that he does not want nuclear weapons and that he lacks  the economic capacity to conduct such a program. Mr. Hata was  simply expressing his hope that these words were well-founded.  In any event, we do not know if Pyongyang already has the bomb  or if it wants to have one.    [LE MONDE] How do you interpret the behavior of the North  Korean leaders? Have they made mistakes or are they pursuing a  subtle strategy?    [Kakizawa] I believe they are playing a quite intelligent  game. They probably already have reprocessing installations.  Would they need such equipment if it was simply for a civil  program? It is doubtful. I think they are playing for time.  Is it not odd that Kim Il-song is thinking -- as he said to  Mrs. Miki, the wife of the former Japanese premier -- of a  meeting with the South Korean president on 15 August? I find  this rather late for a meeting which it was said should take  place "as soon as possible."    [LE MONDE] North Korea is in the process of achieving one of  its aims: With Mr. Carter's visit, it obtained direct dialogue  with the United States. Is this not already a success?    [Kakizawa] This is true. It is a diplomatic success. But  North Korea's ultimate aim is to normalize relations with the  United States and obtain an undertaking from Washington not to  use force against Pyongyang.    [LE MONDE] In your opinion, what sanctions should be imposed  against North Korea?    [Kakizawa] They must be progressive. They should not be  seen as a punishment but as concerted pressure in order to  induce Pyongyang to return to the Nonproliferation Treaty and to  ensure that it respects the IAEA provisions. North Korea must  not feel threatened by sanctions which are an expression of  international solidarity.    [LE MONDE] Is China's position of crucial importance in  finding a solution to this crisis?    [Kakizawa] Most certainly. China's support is essential if  sanctions are to prove effective. If it refuses to apply its  sanctions (that is, in its case, to suspend border trade with  Pyongyang) the effect will be practically nil, even if Japan  stops North Koreans living on the island from sending money home.    [LE MONDE] This crisis once again shows the limits to  Japan's  ability to intervene on the international stage. Although this  time the crisis is on its very doorstep, it could not have been  a party to military measures. Yet one of Japan's aims is to  become a permanent member of the UN Security Council. What  constitutional changes would allow Japan to assume the  responsibilities that come with such a status?    [Kakizawa] A revision of the Constitution is not a necessary  condition for Japan's entry into the Security Council as a  permanent member. The intervention of UN peacekeeping forces  for which Japan may possibly supply troops must, we believe,  remain quite limited. These forces must remain neutral and limit  themselves to surveillance activities. Our Constitution does  not provide an obstacle within such a framework.    [LE MONDE] Bearing in mind its constraints, what could  Japan's role be within the Security Council?    [Kakizawa] It could make a positive contribution on several  levels. First of all, financial. Who pays for the operations?  First the United States and then Japan. We fully accept this  funding responsibility. Yet the United States seems to want to  reduce its contribution. Is that because France is willing to  contribute more? That would surprise me. If it becomes a  permanent member, Japan is prepared to assume a higher financial  burden. Also, precisely because of the pacifist commitments in  the Constitution, Japan may seek to influence the UN role more  clearly toward preventive diplomacy. As was the case in  Cambodia.    Finally, Japan will be the only country in the Council not  to  have nuclear weapons. It will therefore be well placed to  exercise its influence with a view to reducing nuclear weapons.  As long as the Council continues to consist of countries with a  nuclear capability that are logically seeking to maintain their  military supremacy, no progress will be possible.    [LE MONDE] When could Japan join the Council?    [Kakizawa] In 1995, the United Nations will be celebrating  its 50th anniversary and there is talk of changing the Charter.  The United States and some 50 other countries are in favor of  Japanese membership. We are aware of the positive stance taken  by France on this question. But some of your leaders express  doubts on our ability to assume the responsibilities of a  permanent member. The statements by [French Foreign Minister]  Juppe are encouraging, but President Mitterrand seems to have  reservations.    [LE MONDE] Some countries fear that the presence of Japan as  a permanent member of the Security Council would produce, due to  the links between Washington and Tokyo, a second U.S. voice?    [Kakizawa] I do not believe so. I believe that we will  demonstrate our independence. China is already a permanent  member but does it represent Asia? It is a rather special case.  On the other hand, Japan could no doubt better represent the  region within the Council.    [LE MONDE] That is the sensitive issue due to the scars of  history. Do you think that these countries really want to be  represented by Japan?    [Kakizawa] I do not know if they want to be or not, but they  must face reality. Interdependence between Japan and Southeast  Asia is becoming increasingly close. Everybody believes that an  increased role for Japan is essential. Following the statements  by the former Japanese justice minister denying that the Nankin  massacre in 1937 ever took place, China and Korea reacted, but  they do so calmly. Japan must certainly not forget the past,  but above all we must make more effort to build the future.    [LE MONDE] What do you think of Mr. Clinton's policy in  Asia?    [Kakizawa] The new team did not have a great deal of  diplomatic experience. Today, I believe that Washington has  become aware of the Asian situation. With regard to China, he  has realized that his own values cannot be too brutally imposed.  Human rights must be respected by the Chinese Government, but  progress must be gradual. On this point the Clinton  administration has become more realistic.    With regard to Japan, the United States first imposed its  quantified targets for reducing its trade surplus. It then  became more reasonable in order to avoid trade conflicts. If  economic relations were to deteriorate, political links would  also be affected. The direction taken by the United States is  favorable to the renewal of mutual confidence.</p>

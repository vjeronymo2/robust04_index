			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Irene Szabo: "Law on Informers: Legal Qualms; </F> Deadline for President To Sign Expires on 2 April"]    [Text] The National Assembly introduced the bill on "the  scrutiny of individuals in certain important positions,"  popularly called the law on informers, "in order to enhance the  purity of the democratic political order," and passed it on 8  March 1992. The text of the law is on the desk of the president  of the Republic, and the deadline for Arpad Goncz to make a  decision concerning the law is 2 April. Constitutional lawyers  informed us that constitutional and professional problems arose  in connection with law No. 8955.    During the four-year term of the Hungarian National  Assembly,  perhaps the most and the loudest discussion surrounded the issue  whether society must be purged of former secret agents, i.e.,  how could one filter out informers of the former regime from  among individuals in important positions. The annals record two  major cases: The envelope calvary of the Smallholder Jozsef  Torgyan, and the case of Istvan Csurka, former vice chairman of  the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], currently copresident of  the Hungarian Life and Truth Party [MIEP], who "made himself  transparent" before the public in a way which one could call a  masterstroke of dramatic art.    After the wrangle of arguments and counterarguments, in the  beginning of March, parliament finally passed the III/III law,  the preamble of which contains the following: "The National  Assembly" acted "in order to enhance the purity of the  democratic political order." The opinion arose among  constitutional lawyers that the text of the law is problematic  for several reasons. In their opinion, the first large group of  problems concerns discrimination. Namely, Paragraph 70/A of the  Constitution forbids any kind of discrimination between one  person and another. The Constitutional Court explained in  several decisions that one must examine in an objective and  subjective context whether forbidden discrimination is present.  In view of this, the law becomes a constitutional problem,  because it does not apply to the entire network of secret  agents, only to individuals in the network of the III/III  Department.    According to experts, the selection of the group of  individuals to be scrutinized presents a problem as well. For  instance, the different treatment of church officials and the  control of individuals employed by private employers is  disputable. The problem with including universities is that in  terms of the law on higher education they are regarded as  autonomous public service institutions, and state-owned  businesses are not even part of the political order, because in  them the state is present not as a state organ, and not as an  instance of the state's sovereignty, but rather as one of the  owners in a market economy.    From the point of view of professionality and  constitutionality it is problematic that the law places the  examination in the hands of a three-member committee consisting  of judges, acting not in the capacity of judges, who are allowed  to utilize "any legal evidence." At the same time the process is  closed, which results in the lack of legal guarantees. It is  problematic that if these are not court proceedings, how can  evidence that is applicable in court proceedings be utilized in  a legal way. Beyond the legal status of the members of the  committee, their decision, which is actually a sentence, is also  debatable. It is to be feared that objectivity will be hampered  if the committee's activity is centered on the Interior  Ministry, which submits the material for examination, and  lawyers also consider it absurd if following the decision  charges must be brought against the ministry.    The experts noted as a grave constitutional problem that the  right to appeal to a court is excluded. The Constitution lists  among basic human rights the right of any defendant to request  that his case "be decided by a lawfully established independent  and neutral court in a just and open trial." Personal rights are  absolute rights. They are not subject to the statute of  limitations. And if the above-mentioned committee comes to the  negative conclusion that the individual under examination has a  "past" which is subject to the law on informers, and orders him  to resign from his office or position, then it is restricting  two fundamental rights. The first one is the fundamental right  of citizens to serve in a public office, or to exercise their  free choice of work and profession, and the second one is the  fundamental right of citizens to human dignity, and within it,  to a good reputation.    Lawyers see the essential internal contradiction of the  III/III law in the fact that its enforceability and practicality  is debatable. Today one is justified in asking whether the lists  are genuine or manipulated.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Alfonso Malespin Jiron] </F>   [Text] Commander Henry Ruiz proposed unity beyond the  Sandinist National Liberation Front [FSLN] in order to attain  the unity of the Nicaraguan people and win the 1996 elections.  Ruiz made the statement in the Monimbo neighborhood of Masaya  one day after announcing his candidacy for the FSLN secretary  generalship.    At a preparatory meeting for the FSLN Special Congress, Ruiz  urged Sandinists to elect a secretary general who will promote a  strong party. He urged them to choose "a secretary general who  represents unity, not bands or gangs," because that would turn  the FSLN into a minority party."    Ruiz stressed that all FSLN members are revolutionaries and  leftists. It is not as some people "have been saying over the  past two days, that there are Sandinists on the right and the  left."    In a speech before some 200 Sandinists at the Minimbo  gymnasium, Ruiz said he is "totally convinced that unity is the  only solution" for Sandinists.    Ruiz, who is known as Modesto among the Sandinists, said  that  this unity is urgent. "While we are here talking, (Managua  Mayor Arnaldo) Aleman is creating an army of between 40,000 to  50,000 activists. What are we doing in the meantime?" he asked.    "If we are defeated (in 1996), it will be because we are  divided while they are united and working together," he warned.  Ruiz, who is also FSLN treasurer and member of the Ethics  Commission, said the renewal of the FSLN is necessary because  Nicaraguan society is becoming more democratic every day.    "The FSLN's renewal is not treason; it is a revolutionary  step. Anyone who takes a defensive stance is not on the right  track," Ruiz noted.    This renewal process, however, requires one line of ethics,  Ruiz added. "A revolutionary cannot have a set of ethics  different from those held by his party," he stressed.    Those ethics should be based on peace and should help  resolve  the problem known as "la pinata," an aspect that Ruiz described  as an ethical flaw that "stains the Sandinist record."    "Ideas cannot be fought by disqualification," Ruiz said,  demanding an open and fair debate among Sandinists. "I am still  opposed to the use of dirty methods in the debates," he  stressed. "If this is what happens on the eve of the  convocation, what can be expected at the Congress party?" Ruiz  asked those present, among them Deputies Doris Tijerino, William  Ramirez, Danilo Aguirre, and Julio Marenco.    During his visit to Masaya, Ruiz said he favors keeping the  National Directorate name, which can be expanded and renewed to  maintain some historical factors and ensure continuity. At the  same time, he said the current trends "will be dissolved if we  find the correct solutions for our problems."    He also noted his contributions to the debates among the  Sandinists, to which the National Directorate was opposed. "We  are glad we supported those trends (of opinion) because now we  have the opportunity to discuss our views," he concluded.</p>

			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Observer: Risky business Traders on the foreign exchange markets are clearly hurting more and more. After calling a turn in the dollar recently, the publisher of a reputable daily market report was contacted by a client who, apparently in all seriousness, threatened to unleash a fatwa upon him. It is not entirely clear which currency the irate caller/ friend or enemy is long or short of, but so far the dollar has failed to turn, and police protection has not been necessary.</p>

			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Food &amp; Drink: A storm in an Earl Grey teacup - Giles MacDonogh turns to the tea leaves for new year inspiration EVEN IN our democratic age the nobility has a way of selling things. It was not so long ago that a biscuit company engaged the services of a ducal pair to sell its products: 'Mmmm, orangey,' said her grace, as she nibbled away. The use of noblemen and women in television advertisements panders to snobbery, but the attachment of aristocratic names to dishes has a more interesting history: partly based on the tradition of patronage and, in France at least, on a certain notion of gastro-erotica at the time of Louis XV. It was rarely, if ever, noblewomen themselves who were behind the dishes which bore their names. The Marechale de Soubise never sullied her delicate hands with onions any more than the Duchesse de Mailly spent her time experimenting with baby-rabbit fillets. These dishes were the inventions of cordons bleus. Their purpose was to tickle the palate of His Gourmand Majesty. Any female courtier who came up with something special might well be considered next in line for the royal bed. As we all know, the British do not have sex. There is nothing in the least bit sexy about a sandwich, even if the noble earl of that name did lay down the law as to how it should be made. Boeuf Wellington might have a more aphrodisiac effect, but the origins of the dish almost certainly predate the Iron Duke's time. When we come down to it, most people in Britain would rather have a cup of tea. As it so happens, our most famous tea also bears a noble patent; that of the second Earl Grey. This particular Earl Grey was a busy man, a Whig grandee who introduced the Great Reform Bill in 1832 which began the process which ended with the democratisation of these islands. Did he then have the time to nip off to China in order to put together the blend of black teas and oil of bergamot which bears his name? Tony Wild, of the East India Company, says definitely not. He and his researcher, Robert Baldwin, have been through the Grey papers at Durham University and found no evidence that the noble lord had anything to do with the Earl Grey blend. In a lecture delivered to an invited audience at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum last autumn, Wild poured scorn on the many legends which have grown up surrounding the tea: there was no truth in the story of Grey even visiting China, let alone saving the life of a Mandarin who, in gratitude, taught him his recipe for tea with the oils of bitter oranges. Wild advances his own theory as to the origins of the blend. He traces the tea back to the circle of Sir Joseph Banks, the natural scientist, who edited the official account of the McCartney Mission to China in 1792. The account contains a good deal of information on tea growing including the promiscuous planting of tea bushes and orange trees. Banks was also known to be passionate about tea. One of Banks' friends was Sir George Staunton, whose father, another George, was part of the McCartney mission. Wild has uncovered some circumstantial evidence to show that Staunton might have dreamed up the famous blend, and has consequently marketed a new Earl Grey tea called 'East India Company Staunton Earl Grey'. Rather more likely, however, is that Jacksons of Piccadilly simply asked the famous reformist Earl Grey for permission to attach his name to their new creation. Grey was after all, something a hero for the newly enfranchised middle classes: the tea was bound to sell. Wild believes he may have caused a storm in a teacup by these revelations but the sixth Earl Grey seemed fairly apathetic when I spoke to him: 'He's just trying to launch his new brand, and good luck to him,' he said charitably. The noble lord, who appends his signature to the Twinings brand, admits that the second earl - to whom he refers quaintly as his 'predecessor'  - 'never went to China' thereby refuting the version of the story written on the Twinings' packet. Lord Grey seemed most struck by Wild's claim that he was earning a fortune from Twinings for 'legitimising' the brand. As for the rest he simply was not going to rise to the bait: squabbles of this sort are simply too infra dig.</p>

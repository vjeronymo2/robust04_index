			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLATFORM;  </P> <P> IT'S STILL A BARGAIN  </P> <P> If you took all the countries of Europe and cut them out and pasted them on the  United States, they'd all fit within the confines of the U.S., right? Every one  of these countries charges more than 30 cents for a stamp, yet their service is  terrible. Canada, which is much bigger than the U.S., now charges 30 cents.  </P> <P> My son lives in Toronto and when I go to see him, I tote his mail back to the  United States to mail it because Canadian service is notoriously poor. So  basically for 30 cents, you're going to get a lot of good service.  </P> <P> Now, If they privatize the Postal Service, what would happen is that the best  routes would be taken over by private industry. The Postal Service would be  left delivering the mail between Oshkosh (Wis.) and the Aleutian Islands. The  Postal Service would lose the cream of the business; they'd have to raise the  rates. Some people argue that (the rate) is not a very great bargain if you're  mailing a local bill across the street. But if you mail something across the  country, it's a pretty good bargain.  </P></p>

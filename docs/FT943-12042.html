			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Stancroft's 33% in Devanha Mr Nicholas Berry's Stancroft Trust has taken a sizeable stake in Devanha, the last of the modern broadband cable television companies owned entirely by UK interests. Stancroft, which is the largest investor in three public companies - Coal Investments, Kunwick and Barlow, and Mintel, the consumer research organisation - has taken a 33 per cent stake in Devanha. The group has completed the construction of its cable franchises in both Aberdeen and Coventry. In Aberdeen the company has 16,000 subscribers out of the 93,000 homes that are passed by the cable network and therefore could subscribe. In Coventry there are some 10,000 subscribers out of the 117,000 homes passed. No price was given for the transaction last night, but Mr Graham Duncan, Devanha's chairman, welcomed Stancroft as an investor. 'The additional investment will allow us to develop the group in a way which we would not otherwise have been able to do,' said Mr Duncan. Apart from Aberdeen and Coventry, Devanha owns several smaller licensed cable systems in England.</p>

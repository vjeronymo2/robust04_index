			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Observer: Failing a German test The House of Warburg, which has been advising Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs - Germany's second largest insurance company - in its battle with Assurances Generales de France is putting a brave face on its client's sudden rapprochement with the French insurance giant. 'A compromise rather than a climbdown,' is how Warburg's Piers von Simson describes last week's outbreak of peace between the two feuding insurers. However, it is yet another reminder of how difficult it is for even a top London merchant bank to win its spurs overseas. For a start, banks like Warburg are making a living in Germany defending what would be indefensible at home. They are good at advising their Continental clients on relative values, but twisting arms behind Germany's corporate scenes is a different task altogether. Hence, it is hard to measure their effectiveness in the recent spate of German bid battles. By contrast, there is little doubt that the end of hostilities is a defeat for AMB's fiery chief executive, Wolf-Dieter Baumgartl. He had staked a great deal of his credibility on fending off the French. Like Horst Urban, whose robust defence of Continental Tyre against the Italians cost him his job, Baumgartl's days at the top of AMB seem to be numbered.</p>

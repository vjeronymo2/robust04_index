			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / US holds fire on N Korea penalties A SENIOR US official said yesterday that Washington was 'in no rush' to ask the United Nations Security Council to impose economic sanctions on North Korea for its suspected nuclear weapons programme. The US and South Korea earlier indicated that they might transfer the North Korean nuclear issue to the UN unless Pyongyang achieved progress in nuclear inspection talks with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and Seoul by the end of the month. However, the US will not hold new talks with North Korea until there is progress on inspection, said Mr Robert Gallucci, the assistant US secretary of state for political and military affairs, in Seoul. The US offered the possibility of expanded relations during two rounds of talks with Pyongyang this summer in an attempt to persuade it to accept full nuclear inspections. The US had scheduled a third round for mid-September. But North Korea has so far refused to allow the IAEA to inspect two nuclear waste facilities that could determine whether it has produced more weapons-grade plutonium than it has declared to the Vienna-based agency. North Korea has also rejected talks with Seoul on mutual nuclear inspections unless the South Korean government accepts several conditions. South Korea's chief prosecutor yesterday became the second senior judicial official to resign within a week for property speculation. The resignation of Mr Park Jong-cheol as prosecutor general follows that of chief justice Kim Duck-joo.</p>

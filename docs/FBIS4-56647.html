			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Cecilia Cayone from the "180 Minutes of News" </F> newscast]    [Text] Acting Treasury Minister Luis Javier Grisanti has  said hasty purchases of dollars must be avoided, because the  sale system at the Central Bank will offer greater transparency  to the exchange market.    Regarding this measure, Segundo Melendez, leader of the MAS  [Movement Toward Socialism] legislative wing, has termed the  sale of foreign exchange as the most appropriate way to combat  the escalation of the U.S. dollar. The MAS deputy explained the  implementation of this exchange policy reveals the state has  enough resources to solve the country's financial crisis.    Meanwhile, Henry Ramos Ayub, leader of the Democratic Action  [AD] legislative wing, considered the sale of dollars by the  Central Bank of Venezuela a necessary control measure, given the  situation of collective irrationality. The AD deputy added  exchange controls should have been established in the country  long ago.    Jose Miguel Uzcategui, leader of the National Convergence,  said the sale of dollars by the Central Bank is the most  transparent exchange control that can be established.    In response to a poll conducted by Union Radio at the  National Congress, most members of parliament agreed that the  sale of dollars is a form of exchange control to contain the  fears of citizens. In this regard, let us listen to Deputy Jose  Miguel Uzcategui.    [Begin Uzcategui recording] All those authorized to carry  out  exchange transactions go to the Central Bank, which quotes a  price, and based on that price they conduct the sale. This is  the most transparent exchange control mechanism that exists in  the world. It does not account for the abuses of rigid exchange  controls that exist in Europe. These controls greatly limit the  purchase and sale of foreign currency. [end recording]    Meanwhile, Gustavo Tarre Briceno, chairman of the lower  chamber's Finance Commission, said the following.    [Begin Tarre Briceno recording] The first thing we must note  is that there is no free sale of dollars. As a result, we are in  the presence of a market subjected to some form of control. The  sale mechanism is correct, because the demand will determine the  value of the dollar within limited amounts offered for sale each  day by the Central Bank. I think the closing of the market  yesterday is more important than the dollar sale. By looking at  how the day concluded yesterday, it appears nervousness is  decreasing. [end recording]    Radical Cause Deputy Ali Rodriguez thinks the government is  improvising.    [Begin Rodriguez recording] In any case, as we have stated  systematically, we are responding to emergencies and we are not  basing our response on a coherent strategic plan. I asked for  the right to speak tomorrow at the Chamber of Deputies to  discuss this crisis at the national level and its solution. [end  recording]    In the meantime, AD thinks it is necessary to wait and see  the results of this mechanism implemented by the executive  branch.</p>

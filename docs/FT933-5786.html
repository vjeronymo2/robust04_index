			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Britain's waterlogged bread basket - Unsettled weather is delaying harvesting and eroding grain quality BRITAIN'S bread basket has been a little moist recently. I am told that some southern and western areas have been relatively fortunate, but East Anglia, where I farm, has had a succession of weather fronts passing over it and most have brought showers or longer periods of rain. It makes for a frustrating harvest, made the more so when radio weather forecasters, who should know better, say things like, 'The farmers will be able to get on with their harvest today', after a night during which half an inch of rain has fallen. Do they not realise that it takes many hours of sunshine to dry standing grain after such a downpour? In several cases during the last few weeks crops have been almost dry enough to begin harvesting when it has rained again. The fact is you cannot drive a combine harvester through wet crops. If you tried the internal works would become hopelessly clogged; besides which grain must contain no more than 14.5 per cent of moisture if it is to qualify for European Community intervention buying and/or avoid being dried expensively on the farm or by the purchasing merchant. Many farm grain driers are capable of removing up to 5 per cent of moisture but immediately after half an inch of rain kernels contain 25 per cent to 30 per cent of water and, except under exceptional circumstances, drying such grain is impractical and uneconomic. The crop most farmers in the arable east are attempting to harvest and dry at present is winter-sown wheat. Most barley harvesting, both winter- and spring-sown, has been completed except in the north and in Scotland. Winter wheat is generally recognised as the highest yielding cereal grown in the UK as well as being the most profitable. Predictably, therefore, the UK grows and harvests two and a half times as much wheat as it does barley. In 1992 the Ministry of Agriculture estimated that the national wheat crop amounted to some 15.7m tonnes while the barley crop totalled only 6m tonnes. Oats, rye and triticale added another 500,000 tonnes between them to bring the entire harvest up to a little over 22m tonnes. Domestic demand for home-grown grain for both human and animal consumption is about 16m tonnes leaving 6m tonnes for export. In recent years the quality and price of UK samples have been such that markets have been found for most of this tonnage - mostly in other EC countries, although significant quantities went elsewhere. Very little has languished in intervention stores. This year, however, quality is being eroded by unsettled weather and UK prices are less attractive to overseas buyers because of the strengthening pound and the relative weakness of the French franc. The French, needless to say, have a much bigger exportable surplus than the British and they are cashing in on the currency differences. And the longer the weather stays catchy the greater will be the French advantage. Cereal harvesting in France is virtually over and although northern France has experienced the same kind of weather as the UK and this has caused some deterioration in the quality of late-harvested wheat, this was nothing compared to the damage since done to British crops. Milling quality, in particular, is being washed away by the rain. Quality is assessed by a series of complex tests and it is only by reference to the results of these that merchants will bid for a sample. The three most commonly used criteria in the UK are for individual grain weight and size, for protein content, which needs to be above 11 per cent for best bread-making potential, and for the quality of the dough produced. The best possible test would be to bake a loaf with the wheat in question but this is too time-consuming for practicality, so other quicker methods have been devised. For dough quality most British millers rely on the Hagberg Falling Number Test. It involves grinding a measured sample of wheat into meal, mixing it with a predetermined amount of water in a test tube, heating the solution for 60 seconds and mixing the result to a kind of dough. A weighted plunger is then introduced into the top of the test tube and allowed to sink by its own weight. The number of seconds the plunger takes to reach the bottom of the tube is the Hagberg reading for that sample. The higher the number the better the wheat for baking bread. Other tests are used in other EC countries and this can cause complications for grain intended for export. The Chopin Alveograph Test, for instance, requires dough to be mixed and then blown up and burst like bubble gum, in order to test its elasticity. Another is called the Zeleny Test and yet another the SDS. All are variations on the theme of checking the strength of the gluten in the grain, which is consistently related to its bread-making potential. And gluten is strongest in crops that have suffered least rainfall when they are ripe. This year protein levels in the UK have been generally low at around 10.2 per cent. Hagberg readings have been variable and any sample with a number in excess of 200 combined with 10.5 per cent protein is likely to be worth a premium over the feed wheat price of around Pounds 100 of Pounds 25 to Pounds 28. Last year both protein and Hagberg readings were much higher as were ex-farm prices. This year the wet harvest has reduced quality and the fall in the value of the French franc has cut export possibilities. So, what is to happen to wheat surplus to UK requirements? For in spite of this being the first year of set-aside there will still be a surplus - some traders say almost as big as in 1992. Very little, I am assured, is likely to go into intervention stores when the EC buying-in scheme opens in November. Or if it does it will not stay there long. For the EC has introduced a new scheme of export restitution payments to help finance exports to third countries and pay transport costs. This, the trade believes, will ensure that vast tonnages of wheat do not lie idle while those who desperately need it remain hungry. But it is inevitable that UK farmers will be forced to take lower prices than they had hoped. I am writing this on the morning of August Bank Holiday Monday. After yet another night of light drizzling rain the sun has come out. In a few hours' time we shall try again to harvest some wheat. We already know it will be too moist to sell and will need to be dried like most of the grain we have gathered this year. We still have several days of harvesting ahead of us and feel we cannot afford to wait for the ideal conditions, which are so elusive. Bank workers and other office wallahs may be sunning themselves on a beach. But we farmers and our workers will be hard at it. Who was it who said it was the relaxed way of life that made us do it?</p>

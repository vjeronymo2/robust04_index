			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Canada to unveil radical social security blueprint Canada's Liberal government will today unveil a blueprint for overhauling a panoply of generous but costly and increasingly ineffective social security programmes. The proposals are likely to unleash a debate to test the government's resolve against a plethora of special interest groups, and its commitment to cutting the budget deficit. In an effort to contain the political backlash and retain room for manoeuvre, Mr Lloyd Axworthy, human resources minister, will present the proposals in the form of a 'discussion paper'. He plans to introduce detailed legislation next spring. A government official said the options would reflect a new direction: 'Our main aim is to see if we can move the public debate to a different place.' The Liberals recognise they will be unable to meet their goal of cutting the federal budget deficit to 3 per cent of GDP without trimming social security outlays. The programmes in question now cost about CDollars 39bn (Pounds 18.30bn) a year, a third of total federal spending. They include unemployment insurance, job training, child tax benefits and transfers to the 10 provinces to fund welfare assistance and post-secondary education. Old-age pensions will not be included in the review. Agreement is widespread on the need to reform the social security net, many components of which have been unchanged for the past three decades. Concern centres on the growing group of able-bodied people who have fallen into a 'welfare trap' because of generous social security. Unemployment insurance and social assistance payments now equal 4 per cent of GNP against less than 1 per cent in the mid-1960s. The number of people living below the poverty line has risen steadily. Leaks from Ottawa suggest Mr Axworthy will propose targeting benefits more narrowly, creating incentives to encourage people to look for work or acquire new skills. The discussion paper is expected to suggest a clampdown on workers in such seasonal industries as fishing and construction, who can claim generous unemployment benefits after as little as 12 weeks' work. The government this week unveiled a programme to top up the income of people who accept menial jobs at minimum wages as a way of re-entering the workforce. Mr Axworthy hopes to defuse criticism of the cuts with a proposal to divert some savings from lower unemployment insurance and welfare payments to support under-privileged children. The paper is also expected to propose reforms in higher education funding, by replacing direct grants to universities with more generous student loans. The overhaul will be complicated by split responsibilities between the federal government and the provinces. Quebec's new separatist government has indicated it will not take part in the process unless it considers the reforms to be to its own advantage.</p>

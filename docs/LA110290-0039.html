			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> 'EARMARKING' BUDGET INTO CONCRETE;  </P> <P> AN ONSLAUGHT OF INITIATIVES WOULD TAX FOR SPECIAL INTERESTS AT THE EXPENSE OF  THE GENERAL FUND.  </P> <P> The tax-cutting revolution began in California in 1978 with an initiative,  Proposition 13, that has held down property tax rates for most of the state's  homeowners. But this year's state ballot initiatives will test a tax-raising  concept that could undermine the gains of the tax revolt.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, voters will face three initiatives (Propositions 129, 133 and 134)  that represent a major effort to impose new taxes using a technique known as  "earmarking." These ballot measures require that each new tax be designated for  a specific purpose.  </P> <P> By dedicating these taxes to worthy causes such as fighting crime and drugs or  funding medical trauma centers, the tax-raisers believe they have found a way  to persuade voters to boost government revenues. A further inducement is that  in most cases only part of the population will be subject to the tax because  only certain products, services or groups are targeted.  </P> <P> Therefore, voters are told they will be funding a worthy cause by raising  someone else's taxes. A recent Los Angeles Times Poll found that self-described  non-drinkers, about half of the electorate, solidly favored the earmarked  alcohol tax, Proposition 134, while self-described drinkers opposed it.  </P> <P> The initiatives are sponsored by politicians who use them as platforms to run  for office, and by people with an interest in the services provided by the new  funds. The tax on alcohol, for instance, would be earmarked for rehabilitation  and trauma centers. Not surprisingly, the largest donors to the campaign for  this measure are the emergency room doctors who would directly benefit from the  tax.  </P> <P> A second measure, Proposition 129, written by Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp  during his unsuccessful campaign for governor, would dedicate revenue raised by  closing so-called corporate tax loopholes to the war against crime and drugs.  However, these "loopholes" were closed by the Legislature in July to balance  the state budget. If the initiative passes and rededicates the revenue, a hole  will be created in the state budget that can be filled only by new tax revenue,  adding to the state's predicted budget deficit. A legislative budget committee  also notes that Proposition 134, mandates more spending that it pays for,  adding to the deficit problem.  </P> <P> Finally, there is a sales tax, Proposition 133, also designated to fight the  drug war and sponsored by Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy, who is running for reelection.  This tax is supposedly "temporary," established for only four years under the  unlikely assumption the drug war will last about as long as World War II. The  reality is that after four years many drug enforcement officers will have been  hired and new programs set in motion. Certainly, the voters will be asked to  continue this tax increase.  </P> <P> Proponents of earmarked taxation argue it makes the taxing process more  accountable to the people. But is this accountability? Once revenue is  designated for a certain service the money will flow to that service whether it  is too much to do the job or too little, and without regard to whether the job  is being done well. The California general fund budget is already tied into  knots by earmarking.  </P> <P> While the people should have a say on how much more of their money goes to  government, our representatives are elected to manage the funds and prioritize  the spending.  </P></p>

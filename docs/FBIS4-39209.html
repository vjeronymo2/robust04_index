			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Kakha Beradze report: "The Registration of Commercial </F> Banks Was Halted in Georgia on 25 May"]    [Text] As has been pointed out in the National Bank, there  has been a more than sufficient increase in their number. As of  24 May, the number of commercial banks that had been registered  amounted to 210, of which 138 were set up during the last year  and a half.    According to specialists, such an increase in the number of  commercial banks has been due to the inflation of the coupon.  The exchange rate of the coupon is increasing constantly  whereas the minimum capital fund for newly created banks  remains, as before, 500 million coupons. If, in January, this  amount was equivalent to $3,000, it was worth $480 by mid-May.  It is unrealistic to open an enterprise with this amount, yet  it is wholly possible to open a commercial bank, which Georgian  businessmen, moreover, are using to their advantage. It is  precisely for this reason that commercial banks have sprung up  like mushrooms; the National Bank has put a temporary halt to  their further increase until new rates are established for the  minimum capital fund.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Gloomy Future If We Vote `No'"] </F>   [Text] Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen (National  Coalition Party) has rejected claims that the report on the  effects of Finland's staying outside the EU [European Union] has  been classified as secret.    "The opposite is the case. The results of the investigation  must be made public as quickly as possible," he said yesterday  when commenting on reports in ILTA SANOMAT that the government  is trying to keep the "report on the repercussions" secret.    The report says that a section of industry would move  abroad,  as would many jobs. Nor would there be new investment in a  Finland that had placed itself outside the European Union.    According to Salolainen, the reason why the government has  not made the report public is that the work on it is still  continuing. For example, the sections on agriculture, regional  policy, and foreign policy are still only half finished.    The report, sections of which have now leaked out to the  general public, is the report that the government commissioned  in spring 1993 and that is to figure in the EU debate prior to  the referendum later this year.</p>

			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEMENTOS OF SAN MARINO, THE 'SOUVENIR STATE'  </P> <P> There is a certain decor that I call "European Country Mellow." It usually  means an open hearth and candlelight, copper pots and paned glass. It goes with  good regional cooking and a warm welcome. When I find it in a restaurant or an  inn, I feel at home.  </P> <P> That is the cozy style of Taverna Righi, on the sundown side of the tiny  European country of San Marino. The upstairs dining room has the necessary  copper pots and terra cotta planters. Handpainted ceramic plates gleam against  rough white walls that are framed in wooden beams.  </P> <P> Crisp tablecloths are the color of salmon. On the wall above the hearth is a  beaten copper mural that shows a stagecoach coming up the steep road to this  hilltop state, a land surrounded by Italy.  </P> <P> I was there on a cool spring night. Only two other tables were filled. On a tip  from the owner -- Giovanni Righi -- I ordered a pasta prepared with salvia,  which is fresh sage.  </P> <P> In the center of the room was a table laden with wonders from the kitchen:  plates of antipasti, bowls of crinkled lettuce, salmon, cheese, strawberries  and pastries. The backdrop was a three-tiered sculpture of San Marino's walls  and turrets. The sculpture was made of bread.  </P> <P> The Taverna Righi overlooks the flagstones of the Piazza de la Liberta with the  required bell tower -- one is always near places of European Country Mellow  decor. At 8:30 p.m. I heard the bells: eight deep tolls from a big bell, and  two merry plinks to mark the quarter hours.  </P> <P> Beyond the piazza and beyond distant ragged hills the sun was setting in a  burst of blood red. It reflected on the copper and the lanterns and the walls.  </P> <P> It was the end of my first day in this ancient place, a collectible among  nations and rife with idiosyncrasies. RSM -- as it is designated on oval bumper  stickers -- claims to be the smallest independent state in the world. It covers  23 square miles on the slopes of Mt. Titano, a rugged escarpment that juts  2,500 feet above the Adriatic.  </P> <P> The republic boasts a standing army of 120, as if acknowledging that there is  little room to sit down. Its national anthem has bold music but no words, an  economy that also seems fitting.  </P> <P> I had driven east that morning from Florence and followed the red-brick road  that winds toward the thousand-year-old ramparts.  </P> <P> San Marino is a medieval museum, a souvenir state that thrives on tourism and  the mementos that travelers covet. Crooked lanes bristle with heraldic banners  and T-shirt stands. High on a shopping list are elegant postage stamps that  feature lacy flowers, San Marino coins and, for reasons not altogether  inappropriate, the faces of Mickey Mouse and Walt Disney.  </P> <P> If San Marino were to have a sister state -- a place of like spirit and  goodwill -- it could be Disneyland. Both are fanciful settings and  astonishingly clean. Both draw their biggest crowds on summer weekends.  </P> <P> San Marino, too, lives by costumes and parades. The oldest military order, the  crossbowmen, dates from the 1300s. First trained to defend the mountaintop, the  crossbowmen now practice the sport for international competitions. Crossbows,  from key chain miniatures to chest-high models, fill the gift shops.  </P> <P> Blue and white, the national colors, are everywhere, even on skimpy monogrammed  towels at the Grand Hotel San Marino. A room sign warns souvenir hunters: "The  chambermaid is responsible for two hand towels, two bath towels and two  washcloths. If any are missing at checkout time, the maid must pay."  </P> <P> Of course I did not dare. I would no more steal in a land of crossbowmen than  I'd sing their national anthem.  </P></p>

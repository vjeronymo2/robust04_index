			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Competition argument unconvincing Sir, The recent public relations furore over the affairs of British Gas should not be allowed to divert attention away from the much more important long-term issues arising from the proposed introduction of full competition in the domestic gas market. The recent report on this issue by the trade and industry select committee came to conclusions on prices and security of supply which are closely in line with the analysis in our recent study, UK Gas Policy: Regulated Monopoly or Managed Competition? On prices, we said that competition is unlikely to result in significant reductions in the average domestic price of gas over and above the effect of the retail price index-4 price formula already applied to British Gas; and the select committee acknowledges that the extent of any price reductions attributable to the introduction of competition 'remains highly uncertain'. We also concluded that, under competition, it will be difficult to maintain the present level of gas supply security and the select committee agrees 'it will be less easy for new competitors to match supply and demand, given their smaller size and the reduced ability to forecast demand in a competitive market'. It was primarily these considerations which led us to the view that the overall balance of benefits, costs and risks was unfavourable. The select committee, using the same data and similar analysis does not come to that judgment and the issue remains unresolved. Much of the discussion has been polarised into one of 'for or against competition'. This is misguided. In appropriate circumstances, competition can bring great benefits. But in the case of domestic gas, we remain to be convinced that there is an overall balance of advantage.

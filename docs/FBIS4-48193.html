			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Kigali, May 14 (AFP) -- The UN mission here hit  out Saturday [14 May] at United Nations Security Council delays  in deploying fresh troops in Rwanda, as the corpses of thousands  of victims of the country's ethnic bloodbath surfaced in  neighbouring Uganda. "A single day's delay is one day too  much," said Moctar Gueye, a spokesman for the United Nations  Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR) in the capital.    Reduced from 2,500 to around 400, the mission has become  powerless to prevent continuation of the carnage which aid  agencies estimate has claimed at least 200,000 lives in little  more than five weeks. On Friday in New York the Security  Council postponed until next week a vote on the planned  deployment of 5,500 additional UN troops. But Gueye added that  he was hopeful that, once authorised, the reinforcements would  be capable of intervening to help secure an end to the  bloodletting.    Meanwhile sporadic bursts of heavy weapons continued in the  Rwandan capital Saturday as rebels fighters battled government  troops for control of the city, Gueye said. The exchanges  between rebels of the mainly minority Tutsi Rwanda Patriotic  Front (RPF) and the Hutu-dominated government forces, were  limited to small arms fire during the afternoon, Gueye said,  adding: "The calm will not last."    Separately, health officials in Kampala said Saturday that  Ugandans living on the shores of Lake Victoria had had to bury  thousands of corpses flowing into the lake from Rwanda though  the River Kagera. The officials warned that unless the mass  burials were expedited, epidemics could break out as mutilated,  decomposing bodies continued to flood in.    Ugandan villagers have buried an estimated 26,000 bodies  recovered from the lake during the past three weeks, said  Emmanuel Pinto, a deputy from western Uganda.    The official NEW VISION newspaper reported on Friday that  bodies were arriving at the rate of 1,600 daily. The UN World  Health Organisation has supplied villagers with grave digging  tools to speed up the macabre exercise.    Earlier Saturday in Kigali, former French minister for  humanitarian action Bernard Kouchner called on the international  community to help avert "genocide" in the country. "We cannot  stand by and let genocide be perpetrated," said Kouchner, a  doctor who founded the medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres  and who arrived here on Thursday and spent Friday touring  orphanages and camps for people made homeless by the conflict.    The UN Security Council postponed action on the Rwanda  proposal until early next week after around four hours of  discussions.    British ambassador to the United Nations, Sir David Hannay,  stressed all delegates were aware of the urgency of the  situation, but a US diplomat said he believed Washington had not  received sufficient details on where the reinforcements would be  deployed.    Diplomatic sources said there were unconfirmed reports that  the force would be composed of troops from Australia, Ghana,  Nigeria, Senegal and Tanzania, would include 800 troops deployed  in Kigali to protect the airport and other key sites.  Government sources in Canberra said Saturday that at least 10  western countries, mostly European but including Australia, had  been asked to make a contribution to the new force.

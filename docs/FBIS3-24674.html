			<p>Bosnian     Serb hardliner and army commander-in-chief Ratko Mladic  appears to be taking a less active role in Bosnian Serb politics,  suggesting that his influence on the political decisions of the  Serbian leadership is declining.  The Belgrade daily Politika,  taking note of his failure to appear in public "for some time,"  claimed that "well-informed" sources in Bosnia-Herzegovina "were  even saying that Mladic had resigned."  Politika reported that  Mladic, when asked about that claim, "laughed" it off and said  that he "was busy with obligations at the front."  Suggesting  that he may have been eased out of the leadership circle that  makes political decisions, he claimed not to "want to be very  much present in public" because there are other "individuals who  possess more authority" who should be "in the public eye  (Politika, 19 February).  Further suggesting that Mladic has  involved himself in directing military operations in the field  rather than participating in political decisionmaking in the  Bosnian Serb "capital" of Pale, recent reports have put Mladic at  the fronts near Bihac in the northwest and Olovo in central  Bosnia (Paris TF-1 TV, 13 February; Danas, 15 February).      In contrast to his active role in opposing acceptance of the  Vance-Owen peace proposal in May 1993, Mladic had relatively  little to say to the media in the face of the NATO ultimatum  demanding the withdrawal of heavy weapons from Sarajevo and has  not been observed to comment on recent calls for the reopening of  Tuzla airport.  According to Tanjug, on 15 February Mladic first  announced his refusal to allow the withdrawal of his army's  artillery from the NATO and UN-mandated exclusion zone around  Sarajevo.  However, the next day he declared that his forces  would at least "allow UN observers to be deployed at certain  positions" to monitor Serbian artillery (Tanjug, 16 February).  Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin had earlier  claimed that Mladic's privately expressed support for the plan  had been the key factor in securing its implementation  (Izvestiya, 19 February), although Mladic refrained from giving  the withdrawal plan his public support until 23 February (Pale  radio, 23 February).  In the interim, Bosnian Serb army chief of  staff General Manojlo Milovanovic served as the spokesman for the  military's views (Belgrade radio, 21 February).  (AUTHOR:  NASH.

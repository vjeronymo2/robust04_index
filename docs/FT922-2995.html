			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Books: So what went wrong? - Malcolm Rutherford on Harold Wilson as Prime Minister HAROLD WILSON by Austen Morgan Pluto Press Pounds 25, 625 pages AT THE Labour Party Conference in November 1974 James Callaghan paid an extraordinary compliment to the prime minister of the day. 'Your contribution, Harold,' he said, 'in the first 74 years of our birth will probably never be surpassed, and I doubt very much if it will be equalled.' Callaghan was right. Harold Wilson won four out of five general elections for the Labour Party and was prime minister, in separate terms, for more than eight years. Just before Callaghan spoke, Wilson had been proclaiming Labour as 'the natural party of government'. Yet the praise was also an epitaph. Almost from then on, it was downhill all the way. Some people would say that the decline had begun earlier and even that Wilson was partly responsible. Certainly it is going to be difficult to convince future generations of the degree of enthusiasm - some of it across party lines - going for the Labour leader when he first became prime minister in 1964, and the belief that Wilson was a dynamic, witty and likeable man, a bit of a boffin who could make things happen. A new start was promised, but it did not come. The obvious questions are what went wrong, and why. Yet there is, I think, another underlying question which is more important: did people simply expect too much? After reading Austen Morgan's long and immensely detailed biography, it is hard not to conclude that Wilson's governments were much like those that have followed. There was perhaps one exception: that was the heyday of Margaret Thatcher around 1985 when she had defeated the miners' strike, seemed to have come to terms with Europe and to have conquered inflation. But even for Mrs Thatcher triumph did not last: it was back to party squabblings (Westland, the poll tax), inflation resurgent, new problems with Europe and, eventually, her enforced departure. Wilson began his own account of his 1964-70 administration with the words: 'This book is the record of a government all but a year of whose life was dominated by an inherited balance of payments problem which was nearing a crisis at the moment we took office; we lived and governed during a period when that problem made frenetic speculative attack on Britain both easy and profitable.' Leaving aside the question of whether his government should have devalued the pound earlier than it did, the background was even worse than he suggested. It was the sheer pressure of events that dominated. There were strikes, there was Rhodesia, Vietnam, the re-emergence of the troubles in Ireland, conflicts between defence expenditure and defence commitments, as well as the ever present dilemma of how to deal with Europe. Some of the problems have been resolved or have disappeared with time: Rhodesia, for example. Even then, it did not happen quickly. In the late 1960s, the Wilson government tried to grapple with trade union reform. It failed, but its Conservative predecessors had scarcely even tried and Edward Heath was no more successful in the early 1970s. It was left to Mrs Thatcher to pull it off, but by then - to borrow a phrase - the time was ripe. Possibly the Wilson cabinet, which had more than the normal share of able ministers and plenty of fresh blood to call on, should have acted more decisively to cut public spending at the start. But that again would have been against the grain of the time. The fact was that people wanted more public services and thought that they could be financed. It is sometimes said that many of the alleged failings stemmed from the nature of the Labour Party. Yet that argument, too, looks less convincing in retrospect. The truth is that all big political parties are coalitions. Look at the Tory Party at present as an illustration: it is quarrelling over Europe just as the Labour Party did under Wilson. John Major's task is to hold it together while making what progress he can. Wilson would have been familiar with the problem. Wilson, in any case, was never much of a socialist. He was an economic liberal who worked with Beveridge, a wartime civil servant and university don who simply believed that the economy could be better run, but not necessarily centralised. The phrase 'bonfire of controls' was his in 1948. Towards the end of his spell in office in 1969, he was telling the party conference that while the politics of the 1960s had to do with problems of economic management, in the 1970s they would have to do with the environment, which put him somewhat ahead of his time. Much later Wilson wrote: 'It has never been any part of my political attitude to tear up society by the roots . . . The best style of government is like rowing - the ideal solution is to get the boat along as quickly as possible without turning it over.' By those standards, and with hindsight, Wilson was not a bad prime minister, certainly in the period 1964-70. In one area, he was unique in the post-war period: he departed of his own accord. Morgan dismisses the conspiracy theories and argues persuasively that Wilson went because he was bored with government and realised, as he told his press secretary, Joe Haines, that 'when old problems recur I reach for the old solutions'. That is an admirable admission. The tone of the book is faintly hostile, which is unfair on the evidence presented. It is not an easy read, but gets better as it goes on.</p>

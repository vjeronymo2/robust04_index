			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Station in space gets backing PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday asked Congress to authorise continued funding for the space station and the supercollider, the two most expensive and politically controversial projects on the US high technology agenda. Mr Clinton selected an amalgam of two preferred options put forward by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for the space station, intended to conduct research into zero-gravity conditions. The recommended version, endorsing plans for a modular station already on the drawing board and entailing expenditure of Dollars 10.5bn over the next five years, would save Dollars 8bn-Dollars 9bn by the planned launch date of 2000-2001. Mr Clinton is calling for greater financial contributions from other nations expected to share in the station's research. Some feared it might be abandoned altogether. The supercollider (a giant particle accelerator on a 50-mile track) is under construction at a cost of around Dollars 10bn. Mr Clinton said yesterday to abandon it 'would signal the US is compromising its position of leadership in basic science - a position unquestioned for generations'.</p>

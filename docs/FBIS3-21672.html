Brigadier General 'Abdallah  al-Watiri, head of the Counternarcotics Department at the Cairo  Security Directorate, said today that the Counternarcotics  Department succeeded in the past nine months in eliminating most  drug trafficking dens in Cairo, particularly the areas of  al-Batniyah, al-Jayyarah, al-Husayniyah, and Birkat al-Hajj.    Al-Watiri said that the intensive campaigns by  counternarcotics personnel led to the seizure of a number of  kiosks that sell the bango plant, which is a cheap drug compared  to other types. The price of one kilogram of bango ranges from  600 to 900 pounds, whereas one kilo of heroin sells for 400,000  pounds. He noted that campaigns were launched against certain  pharmacies, which resulted in the closure of many pharmacies  that trade illegally in certain medicines and tranquilizers that  contain narcotic and alcoholic ingredients. The Health Ministry  and the Pharmacists Association have been notified.</p>

			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Receiver called to furniture chain ABOUT 550 jobs were put at risk yesterday at 40 ELS stores throughout England and Wales as an administrative receiver was called in at the furniture chain, John Thornhill writes. ELS, which is wholly-owned by the Greater Nottingham Co-operative Society, was particularly badly hit by the collapse of the housing market. KPMG Peat Marwick, the receiver, said ELS had suffered 'continuing significant losses'. The company had turnover of Pounds 50m last year. It employed 423 full-time workers and 123 part-time staff. KPMG said it would seek to sell the business, or parts of it.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Santa Fe de Bogota, 28 Jun (EFE) -- According to  SEMANA magazine, Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela, the paramount  leader of the "Cali Cartel," telephoned a subdirector of EL  TIEMPO daily to swear to him on lives of his children that he  did not make any contributions to any of the presidential  candidates.    The magazine assures that last Thursday [23 June] "amid the  scandal caused by the alleged injection of hot money into the  electoral contest," Rodrigo Orejuela called reporter Enrique  Santos Castillo to explicitly tell him that his organization did  not make any contributions to any of the candidates.    The scandal, which resulted from the disclosure of  audiocassette recordings of conversations between reporter  Alberto Giraldo and the brothers Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez  Orejuela, has tainted Liberal candidate Ernesto Samper's 19 June  election victory.

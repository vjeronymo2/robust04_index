			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME TECH / WHAT'S NEW IN VIDEO: 'DICK TRACY' CASSETTE HAS A LOT GOING FOR IT;  </P> <P> THIS WEEK'S MOVIES  </P> <P> There are several good reasons for renting the just-released videocassette of  "Dick Tracy" (Touchstone, $92.95, PG), even for someone who's already seen the  movie.  </P> <P> Among them:  </P> <P> * To fully appreciate Warren Beatty's strong work both as director and in the  title role.  </P> <P> * To enjoy the sexy performances by Madonna (as Breathless Mahoney) and Glenne  Headley (more subtle, but just as impressive, as Tess Trueheart).  </P> <P> * To test your TV's color fidelity, especially as Richard Sylbert's color-coded  sets fill the screen.  </P> <P> * To still-frame and examine those intricate, special-effects cityscapes.  </P> <P> * To see (again freezing the picture) if you can identify big stars Al Pacino,  Dustin Hoffman and James Caan -- portraying Chester Gould's grotesque gangsters  behind all that makeup. (And maybe you can finally figure out what Mumbles,  played by Hoffman, is mumbling.)  </P> <P> There's a lot more going for this delightful interpretation of the classic  comic strip -- including young Charlie Korsmo's performance as "The Kid" and  the great music by Danny Elfman (score) and Stephen Sondheim (songs).  </P> <P> Of course, "Dick Tracy" has its flaws, too -- a sometimes confusing and  increasingly uninvolving plot, an overuse of (not very good) montages. But even  if the wrapping outshines the contents, this is a Christmas present to be  grateful for.  </P> <P> Also out this week: "The Ewok Adventure" (MGM/UA, $79.98), the 1984 TV movie  that charmingly employed those fuzzy-wuzzies from George Lucas' "Return of the  Jedi," and an offbeat adult comedy about what it's like to struggle in  Hollywood: "Pucker Up and Bark Like a Dog" (Fries, $79.95, R), with cameos by  Robert Culp and Phyllis Diller.  </P> <P> OTHER NEW VIDEOS  </P> <P> If you're a fan of those old Saturday-matinee serials, Republic has packaged  every episode of four more from the late 1930s ($29.98 for each of the four  tapes):  </P> <P> * "Robinson Crusoe of Clipper Island" -- later retitled "Robinson Crusoe of  Mystery Island," but having more to do with the foes of freedom (circa 1937)  than Defoe.  </P> <P> * "S.O.S. Coast Guard." No, it's not a boatload of marijuana, it's an evil  scientist (Bela Lugosi) who wants to rule the world.  </P> <P> * "The Painted Stallion." With a mysterious masked rider aboard, natch.  </P> <P> * "Undersea Kingdom." Also known as "Sharad of Atlantis," this below-sea and  below-par adventure stars Ray (Crash) Corrigan.

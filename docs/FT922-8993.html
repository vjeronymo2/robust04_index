			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / National winner boasts record gains IN NATIONAL terms the Conservatives were plainly the winners in Thursday's vote - and winners on a scale that has eluded them in every set of local elections since the late 1970s. They took a record share of the vote and made a record number of gains. The results indicated a nationwide swing to the Tories of more than 4 per cent. Labour lost seats and votes on Thursday and should not blame the outcome on their election-weary supporters. The turnout does not appear to have declined as much as early reports suggested. However, Labour still control many councils in safe Conservative Commons constituencies. The Conservatives have a clear majority in only 28 of the 207 authorities that went to the polls, while Labour control 88 councils. The Liberal Democrats control eight districts and 68 councils are hung, an increase of nine. Power in most of those is shared between Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Granted that only a third of the seats were at stake in any council, however, the Conservatives fared well in many areas. They won a majority of the seats fought in Birmingham, Bradford, Brighton and Bristol, as well as in Derby, Gloucester, Portsmouth, Stoke-on-Trent, Walsall and Wolverhampton. The Liberal Democrats held all of their strongholds and gained a scattering of seats compared with 1988, when this year's crop were last contested. But in 1988 the centre parties were descending into their post-Owen abyss. This year they plainly hoped for better things, and their disappointment is that they did not benefit from the expected return to the fold of those supporters who a month ago deserted them lest Paddy Ashdown proved the Trojan horse for a Labour government. The normal by-election swing against the government, so often manifest in the annual local contests, was missing. Since April 9, of course, the Liberal Democrats have had no publicity while Labour's headlines have plainly been counter-productive. The government has basked in the afterglow of its un-expected victory, and this week its popularity was reinforced by buoyant economic forecasts and a cut in base rates. There was no strong regional pattern to the results, although Labour's worst results seem to have been in the Midlands. Nottingham and Leicester, where the party polled exceptionally well in the general election last month, did not council elections on Thursday. Scotland had been expected to produce the most interesting results but in the event provided little excitement. Labour advanced in Aberdeen but fell back in Edinburgh and lost four seats in Glasgow. The SNP gained 30 seats, but failed to add to the one council they control or to attain significant bridgeheads. The Conservatives remain very much a minority party north of the border but, as in the general election, a small movement has increased their authority to resist the pressures for radical constitutional change. For the rest of Britain, it is hard to read any great and lasting expression of national will into these votes.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Radio News"] </F>   [Text] The newspaper EL NUEVO HERALD today published an  extract of the last book written by former U.S. President  Richard Nixon, who passed away on 22 April. In his book, "Beyond  Peace," the ultraconservative statesman, who was an enemy of the  Cuban Revolution, expounds on his theory about the policy that  should be followed by the United States regarding Cuba and  discusses the blockade issue.    We give details of journalist Marco Castellon's commentary  on  this issue in "Doing Radio":    [Begin Castellon recording] In his book, Nixon recommends  the  separation of political and economic relations with Vietnam,  allowing each to develop at its own pace. Although he recognizes  differences between the Vietnamese reality and the Cuban  reality, he encourages something similar concerning Cuba.    In Cuba's case, former President Nixon says a considerable  part of the pressure to maintain the embargo is derived from the  old belief, particularly among many members of the exiled Cuban  community, that it is the best way to put an end to what he  terms the cruel and destructive Castro regime. Therefore, he  leaves no doubt about his position concerning the Cuban process.    He nevertheless recognizes that, following the Soviet  Union's  collapse, economic conditions on the island worsened; and after  35 years of Fidel Castro's government, hardliners who oppose him  have not been able to destroy him. Therefore, he says it is time  to change the goal sought by the North American policy, from  trying to harm the Cuban Government to helping the people  because, Nixon thinks, it is highly unlikely the island will  become a subversive threat in the hemisphere even if the Cuban  economy improves.    This means the economic embargo should be lifted to permit  trade, investments, and economic interaction between the United  States and Cuba. He insists, of course, that ideas and  information be allowed to flow as freely as products. [end  recording]</p>

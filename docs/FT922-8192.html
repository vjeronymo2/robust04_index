			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / International Company News: French table plan to boost share buying THE FRENCH government yesterday tabled hotly awaited plans to encourage private individuals to buy more shares, so as to channel more of the nation's savings to its undercapitalised companies. Mr Michel Sapin, the finance minister, presented the scheme, christened plan d'epargne personnel en actions (Pep) at yesterday's cabinet meeting. Parliament will be asked for approval in the autumn so that investors can start placing cash in the current tax year. The scheme would allow individuals to put FFr600,000, or couples to invest FFr1.2m, in shares for a minimum of six years or a maximum of eight, and to receive dividends and capital gains tax free. Shares in both quoted and unquoted French companies are permitted, as are unit trusts, known as Sicavs in France, so long as they are invested in equities. Shares in Peps can be sold within the time limit so long as the proceeds are immediately reinvested. The idea was launched by Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, while he was finance minister, as a way to reinforce French companies' equity bases, which a series of surveys have shown to be weak by their main competitors' standards. Peps are also designed to entice savers to invest in partial privatisations, which Mr Michel Charasse, the budget minister, has estimated will raise around FFr10bn for the government this year. Estimates of total demand for the new Peps vary from FFr20bn to FFr40bn per year. The scheme follows a similar model to the plan d'epargne populaire, which was introduced two years ago and offers tax breaks for investments in bonds. It has raised FFr240bn to date. However, the equities Pep is likely to disappoint stock market professionals, who had been urging more generous tax benefits. Critics also point out that it does nothing to solve the wider problem of the very small number of company pension funds in France.</p>

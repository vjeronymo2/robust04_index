			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / International Company News: J Crean in red after IAS write-off JAMES CREAN, the Dublin- based industrial holding company, suffered a pre-tax loss of IPounds 15.4m (Pounds 15.1m) for the 1992 year reflecting a IPounds 30.7m total write-off of its investment in IAS, an aircraft leasing subsidiary in which it first invested in 1986. Pre-tax profits for 1991 amounted to IPounds 11.4m. An additional provision of IPounds 1.8m was made against a loan for an option to acquire a holding in a UK business, making a total exceptional charge of IPounds 32.5m. It is the second year running that the group made a write-off provision, a IPounds 7.1m charge having been made in 1991. Operating profits fell 2 per cent to IPounds 24.1m on turnover up 8 per cent to IPounds 226.2m. Net borrowings rose 21.4 per cent to IPounds 69.7m, representing 76.5 per cent of net assets including goodwill. The company said that the IAS write-off 'which includes all Crean's loans, investments and guarantees' to the company, has been made because 'the affairs of IAS have over-shadowed Crean's other business interests in a disproportionate manner for the past two years'. Crean increased its stake in IAS from 31 to 38 per cent in 1991. The company said that a recovery in aviation 'offers a good prospect of realising value from its loan stock in IAS in due course'. Crean's main profit centres are in food and beverages, in operations in the US and Ireland, and in print and packaging through Inishtech, a 72.7 per cent-owned subsidiary. Losses per share amounted to 70.3p. A final dividend of 4.635p is recommended for a total of 12.5p (18.34p).</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "The Voz Andes Newscast"] </F>   [Text] [Name indistinct] has charged that the mobilization  decree is unconstitutional and that military forces working in  Cotopaxi, Tungurahua, Chimborazo, and El Loro have already  silenced several radio stations and peasant groups.    We reported during our noon newscast that Radio Latacunga in  Latacunga had been closed, as well as the radio station of the  Radio Schools in Chimborazo province. Manuel Mena, the General  Communications Secretariat representative in Azogues, gave us  the following report on the situation in the province.    [Begin Mena recording] Answering your question, we have been  strictly complying with the executive decree that went into  effect at 2300 yesterday, in the province of [words indistinct].  General Ordonez, the Army commander of the [words indistinct]  stationed in Cuenca, Azuay province, has issued the  corresponding orders so that Army personnel can clear the roads  in the sectors of [words indistinct] Canaro, Tambo, and onward,  the [word indistinct] crossroad that divides the road leading to  the coastal and northern areas of the country.    Furthermore, you probably already know what is happening in  the area where the residents have taken this long-lasting  problem into their own hands [words indistinct]. The strike  committee is presided over by Galo Penagil, the president of the  municipal council in this area. They took this position of force  and proceeded to close the roads that join the provinces of  Guayas, Dos Rios, and El Loro in northern Ecuador. The situation  is still very worrisome because, although it is true that the  government decreed the state of emergency, the flow of traffic  is still not normal [words indistinct] and shortages continue to  be felt in the southern part of the country.

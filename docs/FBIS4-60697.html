			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Cairo, 24 May (MENA) -- Petroleum Minister Hamdi  al-Banbi has stated that Egyptian oil and natural gas reserves  increased in the past four years by 1.7 billion barrels, at a  rate of 28 percent of the reserve in 1990. We now have a  reserve of 7.7 billion barrels, he said.    Al-Banbi pointed out in a statement today that the increase  in reserves, which do fluctuate, was the result of a special  policy the petroleum sector pursued to encourage investment in  oil and gas prospecting and production. He remarked that this  policy resulted in the discovery of 70 new oil and natural gas  reservoirs, 24 of which have already been placed on the  production map.    He added that the increase was also the result of increasing  efforts to develop productive wells by drilling intermediary  wells, supporting the subsidiary production of water and gas,  and the application of advanced technology.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Damascus, 1 Mar (SANA)--The newspaper TISHRIN has  stressed that in light of the serious Israeli escalation, it is  natural for the Arab delegations to view the talks as a waste of  time and to agree on the need to assess the situation and place  the international community and the cosponsors of the peace  process before their responsibilities.    The paper says that the Arabs have done everything to render  the Washington talks successful. They have offered the  establishment of a just, comprehensive, and durable genuine  peace in the Middle East. However, Israel's response has always  been the intensification of the settlement activity, arming of  settlers, and urging them to commit crimes and destroy Arab  property and houses.    The paper explains that the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and the  subsequent events are the natural outcome of the Rabin  government's policy of arming settlers and deploying armed  settler patrols throughout the occupied territories. The Rabin  government has ignored their crimes and threats to expel the  Arabs from their homeland en masse. In the same vein, the Rabin  government expanded settlements and allocated large funds from  the U.S. loan guarantees to build new settlements. It also  forced the Palestinian side to accept keeping the settlements in  Gaza and Jericho, where they will act as hotbeds of aggression  and a sword brandished against the Palestinians.    TISHRIN says that Israel is responsible for all crimes and  for the obstruction of the Washington talks. The international  community is dutybound to protect the Palestinian people against  Zionist terrorism. It should compel Israel to comply with the  requirements of peace so that peace may prevail. Such  requirements necessitate full withdrawal by both the army and  settlers from the occupied Arab territories.    For its part, AL-BA'TH stresses in a commentary that the  campaigns of denunciation of the occupation's crimes and glaring  hostility to peace cannot be useful unless these campaigns are  translated into practical pressures to curb Israel's defiance of  the international community, which is looking forward to peace  in this region.    The paper says: Therefore, practical steps must be taken to  prompt the Rabin government to declare its explicit compliance  with the bases of the peace process, so that the bilateral talks  may resume. The paper stresses that otherwise, the peace  efforts will continue to revolve in a vicious circle and the  occupation crimes will continue indefinitely.    AL-THAWRAH indicates that the sinful hands that shed the  blood of our children and brothers in occupied Palestine and  Lebanon are the same hands. Moreover, the fingers and even the  fingerprints are the same. The paper says that even police dogs  could trace the perpetrator and the criminal who masterminded  the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and the explosion at the Sayyidat  al-Najat Church in Lebanon.    In a comment, the paper asks: Besides condemnation and  denunciation, what will the international community do to stop  the Zionists' crimes? What will it do to curb this racist Nazi  Zionist ghoul?    The paper says that the UN Security Council has an  opportunity now to prove that it is truly a council for  defending the security of those who need it. The UN Security  Council should defend the defenseless Palestinian people from  the ferocious and horrible Israeli machine of aggression, the  paper notes. The UN Security Council's responsibility today is  immense, historic, crucial, and doubled.    The paper adds that the UN Security Council faces major  challenges, especially with regard to safeguarding the peace  process, at whose tables Israel is committing peace massacres  that are not less appalling than its bloody massacres. It has a  responsibility toward protecting the Palestinian people against  the Zionist terrorism. The biggest responsibility and the  biggest challenge is to safeguard the entire international  security against the dangers of Zionism and racism, which thrive  on rivers of blood.</p>

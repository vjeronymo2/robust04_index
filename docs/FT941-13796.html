			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Management: Principles to fasten on to - Trifast is a pioneer of partnership sourcing. Andrew Baxter reports on the background to its flotation For the average hard-nosed stock market investor, laudable concepts such as partnership sourcing, just-in-time delivery and total quality management tend to take second place to cash flow, gearing and dividend payments. But for Malcolm Diamond, managing director of Sussex-based Trifast, they are three guiding principles for business. After a decade using them, and persuading customers to work in partnership with Trifast, he is hoping to convince investors of their importance too. Trifast is going public next month in a Pounds 15m flotation that will raise Pounds 3m-Pounds 4m for the company - most of the rest will go to its two founders, who are cashing in a big part of their stake. The pathfinder document is due to be released on Wednesday. In financial terms, it is an unexceptional deal, and Trifast's products  - some 70,000 different types of industrial fasteners with names like the Binx Nut and the Hank Rivet Bush - are unlikely to get City types salivating. But, apart from offering an investment in a barometer of the UK electronics and electrical industry, where most of Trifast's fastenings end up, it is also a rare opportunity to invest in a UK pioneer of influential management ideas. Diamond, who has worked at Trifast for 19 years and been its managing director since 1984, talks about them with as much commitment and enthusiasm as on the subject of the latest technology for putting heads on to screws. He says the principles are much more than just a philosophical framework - there is a clear link between their adoption and the financial performance of the company, which trades as TR Fastenings. The practice for which Trifast has gained most recognition is known as partnership sourcing. This involves it becoming sole supplier to a customer, normally for all its fastener needs, and often supplying direct to the production line. With a high degree of trust on both sides, paperwork can be cut to a minimum, the customers' stock levels can be reduced and Trifast gets the security of long-term business in return for giving a better overall service. Up to this point, partnership sourcing has much in common with another new approach known as 'fastener management'. In this case a supplier such as Trifast takes responsibility for all the customer's fastener needs, in line with the trend towards the contracting out of 'non-core' services. But the partnership approach goes further, as it leads to a cradle-to-grave relationship on each of the customer's products. The supplier gets an early look at planned products so that it can work out its own schedules and make suggestions to the customers, and also receives early warning of when a product is to be replaced. Partnership sourcing has become increasingly important in the information technology and electronics industry, where short product cycles and the fast pace of change make such a relationship mutually beneficial - if not crucial, especially for the supplier. Other fastener companies, such as Infast, part of Haden MacLellan Holdings, are also developing such arrangements with customers. Partnership sourcing is also being promoted more widely by the Department of Trade and Industry and the Confederation of British Industry. Roger Hardman of James Capel, Trifast's broker, claims partnership sourcing is part of a virtuous triangle which also comprises JIT and TQM. 'None of these philosophies is much use without the others,' he says. 'It's all indicative of an approach that puts the customer first.' Trifast's involvement with partnership sourcing began a decade ago when IBM UK wanted to reduce costs by thinning its supplier base. 'They told us we were an average supplier of fasteners, but our attitudes were better than average,' says Diamond. 'So we were selected as a guinea-pig - because with so many types of fastener there is so much scope for things to go wrong.' Initially staggered by the demands on quality and delivery made by IBM in return for becoming a single supplier of fasteners, Trifast has now won two of the computer company's 'market driven quality' awards and gained sufficiently in confidence to take the concept to other customers. Diamond likens partnership sourcing to a supermarket which customers use because of the overall package - the convenience of shopping in one place, known reliability and quality - even though some individual items might be found more cheaply by going round several shops in the high street. The challenge, says Bob Stevens, group quality director, is to convince purchasing managers to look at overall costs rather than price and to accept that partnership sourcing can lead to savings even if it does not put money in their hands. The costs and time involved in repeatedly contacting a batch of fastener suppliers, asking about price and delivery and choosing the best deal, are frequently overlooked. 'Very rarely do fasteners exceed 1 per cent of total purchasing,' says Diamond, 'but the overheads often exceed that.' Once the core relationship is established, however, there are some useful spin-offs for Trifast. Some IT suppliers are using the fastener supplier to bring in items such as cabling and industrial gloves on its regular trips to fill the fastener bins, says Martin Phillips, director responsible for sales to the IT and electronics industries. Partnership sourcing and fastener management have taken off for Trifast in the past five years, comments Stevens, and it now has 70 customers using such arrangements. This represents just 2 per cent of its customer base of 3,500, but already accounts for about a third of its annual sales and could reach half, says Diamond. For investors, there are two points about such arrangements. First, the margins on this business are generally higher, says Diamond. Just as importantly, partnership sourcing 'locks in' the supplier to the customer, insulating at least part of the business from the vagaries of the traditional customer-supplier battleground. ** Warning -</p>

The engineer unit, led by Battalion Commander Chang  Chong-hun, arrived at Seoul Airport in Songnam at 9 A.M.    Later in the day, the unit was accorded a welcome-home  ceremony at the Armed Forces Athletic Unit. It was attended by  Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae and about 2,000 officers and  families of the returnees.    The unit was flown to Somalia on July 29 last year, where it  had engaged in various civil programs such as repair of roads,  creation of irrigation waterways and operation of schools.</p>

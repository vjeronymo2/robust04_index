			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The pre-sermon speaker at the Tehran Friday  prayers was Dr. Mohammad Javad Larijani, the Tehran Majles  deputy, who began with congratulating the people on the occasion  of the New Year and the Day of God, which is 1 April when the  system of the Islamic Republic was first established. [passage  omitted]    He said: Our legitimate Islamic government is the greatest  gift and treasure bestowed on us by God Almighty and should  therefore be cherished. Saying that a legitimate government can  be harmed by a lack of trust from the people, Dr. Larijani  stated: Just as the people crowd the polling booths, the  people's presence on various occasions is a source of strength  for the system. By the same token, if the people lose their  trust in a legitimate system, that system is harmed.    He added: Currently our enemies are on the wrong path and  have mobilized all their resources for propaganda. They are  seeking to magnify our shortcomings and to undermine the  confidence of the people in the officials and the system.    He mentioned that one of the ploys of the enemy was to  magnify the country's debts, and added: In the middle of last  year, suddenly extensive propaganda was initiated alleging that  Iran could not repay its debts and had become insolvent. Some  European countries to which a repayment of less than 3 billion  marks was due began demanding their money, even though we had  purchased goods worth more than 85 billion marks from the same  countries immediately after the revolution.    He continued: The same European countries have not honored  their commitments to Iran worth $1.5 billion. This propaganda  regarding Iran's debts is not true. The Islamic Republic of  Iran is certainly not bankrupt and is one of the strongest  countries in the region today.    Dr. Larijani said: The enemy's propaganda is aimed at  whipping up an atmosphere of diffidence among the people.  Therefore, it is the obligation of the people to eliminate the  conditions that foster such an atmosphere.    He then referred to the issues of high prices,  discrimination, and corrupt practices that inspire mistrust  among the people and called on officials to tackle these  problems. On the subject of the price spiral, the Tehran Majles  deputy stated: The issue of high prices should be viewed in the  context of the relation between the general income of the people  and the basket [sabad] of expenditure, which is an extremely  important matter. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the  system, the Majles, the government, and all the institutions to  bring it to a reasonable level.    He added: The solution to high prices is for the government  to create conditions conducive to production. He stressed: The  people should be involved in important tasks. It is not correct  for the government to produce and to keep prices at a low level  artificially. Speaking of the Majles' efforts to reduce prices  and inflation, the Tehran Majles deputy said: The deputies of  our dear nation made extensive efforts this year to rein in  inflation and to present a realistic budget with lower  government expenditures, which resulted in considerable  economizing.    He added: The deputies have prohibited any rise in gasoline  prices for 1373 [year beginning 21 March 1994], which was an  appropriate measure for this year. However, in general, it  should not be the policy of the government to keep prices at a  low level artificially. We spend $10 billion from the Treasury  every year to keep gasoline prices at the current level. If  this sum is used wisely, we can perform some other major task.  I do not mean that gasoline prices should be raised tomorrow as  we have to be sensitive to the basket of the people's essential  expenditures. We should realize the effects of all price  changes on the lives of the people.    Dr. Larijani emphasized: Regarding our long-term plans, we  should, on principle, refrain from dipping into the Treasury  merely to maintain prices at an artificially low level. The  people will be able to procure their needs with a little effort  unless prices are exorbitant.    He added: Cash is the lifeblood of a country's economy, and  at times it is expedient that this blood should be thinner and  at times it should be thicker. [passage omitted]    Thus, the remedy is not subsidies from the government. On  the contrary, the government should release itself from such  irrelevant matters and merely supervise and guide the people.  This would encourage better management, which would receive  support from the people, and there would be no avenues for  exploitation by middlemen and tricksters who are adept in  escaping the grip of the law. [passage omitted]    Larijani stressed that the use and popularization of  indigenous products was important, saying: The use and  publicity of foreign goods should be considered contrary to our  values, as it is in some of the progressive countries. For  example, in South Korea, which is one of the advanced countries  of the world, it is very rare to use a foreign automobile and,  in fact, there are no repair shops for servicing foreign  vehicles.    The Tehran Majles deputy said: Our people should note that  if we raise our production ourselves and make our country  prosper, we will be able to cultivate similar qualities in  ourselves. We should believe that we can resolve our problems  and we should realize the value of our influence in the world.    He elaborated: We have not gained this influence in the  world in an easy manner and we should not be negligent on this  matter. When the PLO and Israel said that they were to settle  their differences, we opposed these talks because they ignored  the lawful rights of the oppressed Palestinian people. We were  ridiculed and asked who were we to do so. However, the Muslim  Palestinian nation also had something to say, which was exactly  what we had proclaimed. The whole world had been mobilized to  support these disgraceful talks, but the slogan of "God is  great" and the nature of the Palestinian nation's actions proves  the great influence of our nation and revolution. The fact that  to this day the Palestinian nation has been able to resist the  PLO-Israel plot is a great victory for us.    What country can counteract a political process that is  supported by all the belligerents of the world? This is a great  strength bestowed on us by the almighty, and perhaps we  ourselves are unaware of this greatness. He continued: The  strength that the Islamic Republic of Iran enjoys today is  greater than the power of the bomb and missiles.    The head of the Foreign Policy Committee of the Islamic  Majles then referred to relations between the Islamic Republic  of Iran and the littoral countries of the Persian Gulf and the  hajj issue, saying: The Saudi Government should not deprive  itself of the honor of accepting our pilgrims who wish to  perform hajj.    He said: Iranian pilgrims are jewels in their piety,  conduct, and performance of the religious ceremonies. It is a  source of shame for the Saudi Government to say that it will not  accept a particular number. The Saudi Government should realize  that the friendship of the Iranian Government and nation is the  best base for it in the region. The friendship of the Persian  Gulf countries with the Iranian Government and nation is in the  best interests of these countries, as we do not covet their oil  or seek to dominate them. The United States, on the other hand,  does not have an interest in these governments except for  dominating them and plundering their oil wealth.    He added: The United States is spreading the propaganda that  it is a supporter of the Persian Gulf governments, especially of  the Saudi Government. A few months ago, it was revealed that  the U.S. ambassador in that country was seeking to plot against  that government. To me it is as clear as day that the United  States intends to change the Saudi and Kuwaiti Governments in  the not so distant future.    Dr. Larijani said: We want the greatness of Islam and  honorable and prestigious stances by Islamic countries. We want  to sever the hands of foreigners from these countries so that  the oil income of the Muslims is not pillaged. The sale of  weapons to the Persian Gulf countries is a plot to plunder the  wealth of the Islamic world, and I do not see any similar  pillage in any other part of the world. You, Arab countries, can  have no better friend than Iran.    He concluded: I hope that the Saudi officials perceive what  a great base they have in their vicinity. They should try to  elicit the affection of our people and our government, and this  will be the best base for them in the world. He expressed the  hope that the Iranian pilgrims who wish to perform hajj will be  permitted to do so regardless of their number.</p>

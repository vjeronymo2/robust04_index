			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / International Company News: Belgian insurer advances 12% GROUPE Royale Belge, the Brussels-based insurer, yesterday announced a 12 per cent increase in its consolidated profit for 1991, but refused to comment on plans to collaborate on insurance products with Banque Bruxelles Lambert (BBL), the Belgian bank in which it owns a stake. The company, 47 per cent of which is controlled by Union des Assurances de Paris, reported a profit of BFr4.2bn (Dollars 123m), against BFr3.8bn in 1990, despite a BFr3.1bn drop in surpluses for the year. The company said personal insurance business had improved in all sectors after a poor 1990. The directors will propose an increase in the net dividend to BFr140 from BFr130 per share. Royale Belge and Winterthur of Switzerland - both BBL insurer-shareholders - have been courting the bank about a joint deal in the field of bancassurance, or selling insurance through banks. BBL announced last month that it was open to collaboration with any of its shareholders, thus dampening speculation that it was about to select a partner. Mr Jean-Pierre Gerard, Royale Belge's managing director, pointed out yesterday that Royale Belge did most of its bancassurance business with BBL's competitor, Generale de Banque. Electrabel, the gas and electricity generator and distributor which is Belgium's largest utility company, reported a BFr22.28bn profit for the year, compared with BFr22.16bn in 1990. The company is proposing to increase the net dividend to BFr290 per share from BFr279 last time.</p>

			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Tribunal explains ruling in case of women brokers THE INDUSTRIAL tribunal battle between currency swaps broker Ms Liliane Preisler and her boss, Miss Cindy Buggins, ended yesterday with the judgment that neither party had impressed the hearing's chairman 'as entirely reliable witnesses of truth'. The tribunal ruled at the end of last year that Ms Preisler's treatment by City-based Euro Brokers Capital Markets over her maternity leave had not constituted sexual discrimination. It agreed, however, that she had been constructively dismissed and was owed money by her employers. Yesterday the tribunal provided detailed reasons for its decision. In particular, it found that Ms Preisler had not been discriminated against when six of her best clients were taken away from her during her nine months' maternity leave. The redistribution of her client list 'was a proper exercise of management authority'. The case received much publicity because of the clash of personalities involved and the glimpse it gave of high-earning City life. Ms Preisler received a basic salary of Pounds 70,000, plus bonuses and perks. This amounted to an estimated annual income of Pounds 150,000. The tribunal said that 'when Ms Preisler returned to work, although Miss Buggins wanted to keep her, she was nevertheless determined to cut her down to size and render her more tractable, in which endeavour she failed by pushing her too far'. It added: 'Whether this was also the reason for the removal from her list of her more important customers, it is impossible to know.' Ms Preisler alleged she was passed over for promotion because of her pregnancy, but the tribunal agreed with her boss that she was not a suitable candidate for promotion. Ms Preisler, who says she is owed more than Pounds 30,000 in unpaid bonuses and maternity entitlement, has proceedings pending in the High Court. Her award from the tribunal has been limited to one month's salary - which will probably reach the maximum amount of Pounds 10,000 a tribunal can award. Euro Brokers has yet to decide whether it will appeal against the tribunal's findings.</p>

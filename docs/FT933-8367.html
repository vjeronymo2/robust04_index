			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / International Company News: Group loss at Banesto for first six months BANESTO, the big Spanish banking group, has reported a consolidated loss of Pta130m (Dollars 915,000) for the first half of 1993, compared with a group profit of Pta32.7bn in the same period last year. The first-half figures, which include the Banesto parent, its affiliated banks and its big industrial holding company, were released two days after Banesto announced it had completed a record Pta94bn capital increase. The first-half figures are not surprising, as Banesto has been making big provisions and weaker profits from its banks have not been enough to cover losses in the industrial group as Spain has sunk further into recession. The banking group reported first-half profits earlier this year of Pta5.7bn, down 82.6 per cent on 1992. While the consolidated figures also show that Banesto is having some trouble containing operating costs, the first-half loss is nevertheless a sharp improvement on the Pta2.4bn deficit reported for the first three months of this year. Banco Central Hispano made a net profit of Pta39.6bn in the first half of the year, a 6.6 per cent increase on 1992. The bank said that it had allocated Pta54.6bn to depreciation and provisions, a 46.4 per cent increase on last year.</p>

			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: The franc alone is not enough - Paris THERE are some places where money alone is not enough, and Paris is one. Anyone - well, almost anyone - with a fistful of francs can buy their way into the front row of the Chanel haute couture show, the best seat at the Opera de Bastille, or a candy-coloured villa on Cap Ferrat. But they need much more than money to join the gilded group of guests chez Baronne Marie-Helene de Rothschild at Hotel Lambert on the Ile Saint-Louis. The Rothschild salon is the summit of the French social scene. The baronne, aided and abetted by her husband, Baron Guy, patriarch of the banking dynasty, need barely blink at the bills for her Christian Lacroix ballgowns, or for the mink-covered plates that decked the tables of the surrealist ball, her social coup in 1972. But Marie-Helene de Rothschild has the elan to turn her soirees into more than just gaudy gatherings of the very, very rich. Her salon is modelled on those that Marcel Proust visited in 19th century Paris and on that of Marie-Laure de Noailles in the 1930s, whose artistic proteges, Jean Cocteau and Salvador Dali, mingled with the creme de la creme of French society. The Rothschild guest list is the giveaway. There is old money in Baron Alexis de Rede, who lived in Hotel Lambert before the Rothschilds, and new money among the baron's fellow bankers. There is also politics in Jacques Chirac, mayor of Paris and prospective French president, alongside Edouard Balladur, the new conservative prime minister who may yet be Chirac's chief challenger for the presidency. And there is culture in Bernard-Henri Levy, the philosopher, and, before his death, Rudolph Nureyev. What the guest list says is that the Rothschilds are not only rich, but can hold their own in artistic and political circles too. It speaks volumes about the ambivalent attitude towards wealth in a country like France, where an idiosyncratic blend of Roman Catholic guilt and republican egalitarianism rubs up against the snobbish vestiges of the ancien regime. The French revel in the (very expensive) things that money can buy. It is no coincidence that le luxe - the business of selling luxurious goodies like champagne, designer clothes and foie gras - is one of France's most successful export sectors. But the real allure for the French is power. Wealth, even serious wealth, is only respected when, as with the Rothschilds, it is backed by political influence and spent with taste. The key to the Gallic ambivalence about money lies in the means of acquiring it. It is still possible to inherit wealth in France, but the combination of stiff taxes and strict inheritance law has injected enough egalitarianism into the system so that anyone who is born rich and wants to die rich will almost certainly have to make more money of their own. The first blow to the French aristocracy was the 1789 revolution, when the estates of all those who were guillotined or who fled the country were confiscated and auctioned off to the bourgeoisie. Napoleon Bonaparte dealt the decisive blow in 1804 by abolishing primogeniture, the principle whereby fathers can leave their estates to their first-born male heirs. Whereas the British upper classes have handed down fortunes from generation to generation, French estates have been parcelled out among the various legatees. Expectant heirs now face the additional obstacle of death duties, as Pablo Picasso's family discovered when it was forced to hand over most of his art collection to the state following his death in 1973. There is also the wealth tax, tabled by the socialists, which taxes the very rich not only on their income but on the value of their property. The French aristocracy may have held on to their titles, and to the ancient de prefixes before their names, but they cannot count on inheriting very much money, or on keeping it for very long. The great French fortunes of today belong to bankers and industrialists - the Rothschilds, Schlumbergers, Dassaults and Michelins - who have added to their inheritances. This notion of the rich justifying their privileges is reinforced by an education system rooted in the concours, the competitive examinations that people take to get into the best universities, the Institut d'Etudes Politiques (alias 'Science Po') or the Ecole Polytechnique ('X') in Paris, and the elite Ecole Nationale de l'Administration (ENA). In theory the exams should ensure that the system is egalitarian. In practise the student rolls of Science Po, X and ENA are still dominated by privileged Parisians. Yet the existence of these institutions, all of which are geared towards preparing their alumnae for careers in the public sector, has an important influence over French perceptions of success. This is because the country's brightest brains are trained to run the country as politicians or bureaucrats, not to make money for themselves in the private sector. Anyone who does become rich in France is invariably apologetic about it. Pierre Berge, who made one fortune by founding the Yves Saint-Laurent fashion house and another by selling it, prefers to style himself as a failed painter rather than a successful businessman. Bernard Arnault, who battled his way to the top of the LVMH luxury goods group in the 1980s, bills himself as a frustrated concert pianist. No wonder Baron Guy de Rothschild was swift to reassure Paris - Match magazine this month that not only does he not have a chauffeur, but often travels by Metro, although he was rather hazy about the price of Metro tickets. 'Between FFr5 FFr7,' he surmised. 'All I know is that they give you a few coins back each time.'</p>

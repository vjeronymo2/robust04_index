			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> L.A.-PALMDALE RAIL PLAN SIDETRACKED BY CONFUSED COUNCIL  </P> <P> Consideration of a commuter rail line between the San Fernando Valley and  Palmdale was postponed Tuesday for further clarification by a thoroughly  confused Los Angeles City Council.  </P> <P> "This sounds like some kind of a lame-brained idea," said Councilman Ernani  Bernardi, who represents the northeast Valley. "We need some pictures, some  idea of what this is all about."  </P> <P> In a letter to the council, Mayor Tom Bradley and council President John  Ferraro asked that the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission be urged to  study such a service. They said it could relieve congestion on the Antelope  Valley Freeway and help spur development of Palmdale Airport, where the city  owns 18,000 undeveloped acres, which officials have long envisioned as a major  city airport in the next century.  </P> <P> The letter also suggested that trains could run along the Antelope Valley  Freeway, in the right of way, and that perhaps a private contractor would be  interested in developing and running the system.  </P> <P> But neither Bradley nor Ferraro were on hand Tuesday to explain the proposal,  and council members expressed concern about how it fits with other mass  transportation proposals, including the East-West Valley light-rail line and a  proposed high-speed train that could connect Palmdale with Las Vegas. Bernardi  suggested that installing a rail line next to the freeway would cause lengthy  traffic delays during construction.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, chairwoman of the council's Commerce, Energy  and Natural Resources Committee, and Councilman Nate Holden, chairman of the  Transportation Committee, said they had not been given details of the mayor's  proposal. The council referred the proposal to both committees for review.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Proposal Criticized  </P> <P> Later in the day, Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) described the mayor's  idea as a thinly veiled attempt to attract the bullet train to Palmdale over  other destinations such as Anaheim, Ontario, Palm Springs or Victorville. The  California-Nevada Super Speed Train Commission, which Katz heads, is scheduled  to vote on a proposed route in October.  </P> <P> "They know that we're not going to run a train to Palmdale if there's nothing  going out to Palmdale," Katz said. "I don't find it a particularly serious  proposition at this point. There's no financing for it."  </P> <P> But Bill Bicker, the mayor's transportation coordinator, said Bradley merely  wanted to expand on the train commission's efforts. He said the mayor hopes to  persuade private developers to finance, build and run the commuter service. A  similar effort is being made to use private sources to build the bullet train.  </P> <P> The mayor's proposal is supported by the city Department of Airports, which  hopes that Palmdale Airport will become a regional airport, relieving crowding  at Los Angeles International Airport, said department spokesman Lee Nichols.  There are no scheduled commercial flights from Palmdale, but America West  tentatively plans to begin daily service from Palmdale to Las Vegas in January.  </P></p>

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Ex-chairman jailed for insider dealing A FORMER company chair-man was jailed after pleading guilty at St Albans Crown Court yesterday to what the court was told was the biggest insider dealing operation discovered in the UK. Mr Ivor Goodman, former chairman of Unigroup, the Leeds-based timber and clothing company, will be the first person convicted of insider dealing to serve a jail sentence. He was sentenced to 18 months, of which nine months were suspended. As he had been in custody awaiting trial for five months he will have four more to serve, subject to any remission. He was also disqualified from acting as a company director for 10 years. A warrant for Mr Goodman's arrest had been issued by the court when he failed to appear for trial in September. He was arrested in Leeds in December. Yesterday he pleaded guilty to a single charge under the 1985 Company Securities (Insider Dealing) Act, which alleged that while chairman of Unigroup and prohibited from dealing in its shares he sold 690,209 Unigroup shares. The Department of Trade and Industry, which brought the prosecution, alleged that he avoided a loss of about Pounds 1m by disposing of the shares just before the company announced worse-than-expected figures in October 1987. Mr Tudor Owen, for the DTI, said the operation had begun when Mr Goodman purported to give the shares to his girlfriend. A few days later the holding was sold for Pounds 1.67 per share, netting Mr Goodman just under Pounds 1.2m. The shares had been sold, and Mr Goodman had resigned as chairman, a few days before Unigroup's shares were suspended by the Stock Exchange at the company's request. When dealings were resumed five months later the shares traded at 55p. In November 1987 Chase Manhattan Securities, Unigroup's broker, confirmed that it had acquired the 690,209 shares and had started civil proceedings against Mr Goodman. The crown court heard that the action had resulted in the share sale to Chase being set aside. Only two other people have been given jail sentences for insider dealing since it was made an offence almost 10 years ago. But in both cases the sentence was suspended. One was Mr Geoffrey Collier, former joint head of Morgan Grenfell Securities, who was fined Pounds 25,000 and sentenced to 12 months in July 1987.</p>

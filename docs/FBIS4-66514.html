			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interviews with Muhammad 'Abd-al-Muhsin Salih, NDP general </F> secretary and local council head for Asyut Governorate; Husam  al-Kilani, People's Assembly member for Dayrut; Jamil  Abu-'Aqrab, People's Assembly member for Abu Tij; Shaykh Ramadan  Haykal, chief Awqaf Ministry officer in Asyut; and Ahmad Qasim,  Education Ministry undersecretary in Asyut; by Ahmad Musa and  Hisham al-Zayni in Asyut, Dayrut, and Abu Tij; place and date  not given: "Terrorism in Asyut--How Long? They Defend Their  Negligence!"--first two paragraphs are AL-AHRAM introduction]    [Text] Observers of the present situation in Asyut find the  police alone in confronting the darkness-loving bats of  terrorism. It is a tremendous weight to bear. The security  apparatus alone will never be enough to clear Asyut's soil of  the roots of terrorism or to dry up its well-springs of deluded  youths, especially among students and teachers. Where are the  political parties--particularly the majority ruling National  [Democratic] Party (NDP), with its cadres, parliamentary  deputies, and People's Assembly members? What role are the  Education and Awqaf Ministries and preachers playing in training  mosque imams to counter terrorist ideas? Many other questions  need to be asked in order to advance the confrontation with  terrorism, so that all the forces of the people participate in  it.    To begin, we raised the following questions with Muhammad  'Abd-al-Muhsin Salih, the NDP general secretary and local  council head for Asyut Governorate: How do the terrorists commit  their crimes in broad daylight and then disappear? Where are the  members of 49 local councils, who in Asyut number in the  thousands?    [Salih] Unfortunately no one in the media mentions the  positive things that the People's Assembly, local councils, and  the party are doing. Many years ago--in 1987 to be exact--we  organized the Islamic Meeting Place for Youth. We were able to  recruit 4,000 students to stand against the extremist currents  in the university, though these currents had the upper hand and  strong influence. We expanded to set up 10 associations for  students from the different governorates. We went to the Student  Union, which was under extremist control, and battled them in  1988 and 1989. At present, we have penetrated the walls of the  university by winning all 40 seats. The clashes with the police  began when the extremists took to the streets. Their remnants  have gone into hideouts and the areas of random development.    [AL-AHRAM] Then why are incidents of terrorism increasing in  Asyut?    [Salih] The terrorist Islamic Group still has all its  strength and organizations in al-Minya and Sawhaj; there is no  confrontation there. It is clear that a mutual understanding is  evolving in those two governorates about not carrying out  incidents of violence. As a result, elements of these groups  flee to commit their crimes in the territory of Asyut, the place  closest to the two governorates to the north and south. There  must be cooperation between the groups in the three  governorates. The Asyut elements direct, harbor, and aid those  who come to them from the north and south. Their centers of  operation are the towns of Dayrut, Sidfa, Abu Tij, and recently  al-Badari. What happened in the center of the city last December  with the assassination of Brigadier General Muhammad Tu'aymah  was a reaction to the storming of al-Rahmah Mosque. These are  the full facts.  <H5>  Settling Scores </H5>   [AL-AHRAM] Where is the role of the party and the people's  assemblies? Why are they absent from the scene?    [Salih] The first party secretariat at the national level  organized a conference last April to study the reasons for  extremism and propose solutions. Participants included all  political forces and parties--except the Labor Party--the  professional associations, the ulema, and intellectuals. Its  most important recommendation was to form committees for  reconciliation and education. Their mission would be to move  among the clans and tribes in 242 villages, because the Islamic  Group has concentrated on the clans in enlisting its members,  especially in Dayrut. I admit that the police are battling an  unknown foe. It was necessary to penetrate these groups and  reach the second- and third-rank members who were going to  penetrate the schools. We have resisted them in the elementary  schools throughout the past two years.    We carry no weapons in our confrontation with them, but we  have turned over numerous repentant leaders of these groups to  the police. We reached 30 persons and handed them over to State  Security. Members of the party and the local councils were on  the scene only 10 minutes after the recent crime in Sidfa and  transported the victims. We are helping the police. The role of  politicians and grass-roots figures in Asyut is being denied in  order to settle scores. Our role now goes beyond the city  limits. We have committees working in all the cities, towns,  villages, and hamlets. They provide the security apparatus with  information. I can reveal some of these secrets. The dens that  the police stormed in al-Ma'sarah, al-Zawiyah al-Hamra', and  al-Sayyidah Zaynab were stormed because of instructions and  clues that came from Asyut. In general, most of the perpetrators  of the incidents in Asyut were from outside. This confirms that  it is a governorate that expels terrorism, as evidenced by the  fact that most of the Islamic Group leaders whom the police  apprehended in Imbabah, Alexandria, Damanhur, Cairo, and  al-Minya had fled Asyut in the wake of our activity against them.    [AL-AHRAM] People say you began dialogue with some terrorist  leaders, including Salah Rajab. Is it true?    [Salih] The dialogue began in 1992. I received a telephone  call from the Islamic Group after the police took control of  al-Rahmah Mosque in Asyut. They asked me for a dialogue. State  Security did not refuse. I sat with them from 1700 until 1900 in  continuous talks. The goal was to stop the violence for two  months in return for certain demands. After these sessions they  said they would submit the matter by various ways to "their  brother leaders" who were in prison. They asked for a week's  delay. However, it stretched on for 22 days, during which the  incidents erupted. This led to a halt to the dialogue,  particularly as we had asked them to lay down their arms  immediately. Incidentally, we are going to reshape party  formations in any area where individuals prove not to have  cooperated with information in the fight against terrorists. We  have begun with the youth secretariat by appointing new  assistant secretaries. We will combat any passivity. We are now  inventorying the extremists in every home and monitoring their  movements in order to confront them. I should say that there are  about 12 terrorist military wing members in Asyut, in addition  to between 50 and 200 of the second rank.  <H5>  Handing Over Terrorist Leaders </H5>   Leaving Muhammad 'Abd-al-Muhsin Salih, we went to Dayrut,  one  of the constant focal points of violence, where we met Husam  al-Kilani, People's Assembly member in Dayrut.    [Al-Kilani] The charge that we have not played a role on the  scene is wrong. I intervened in 1983 to break up the first  discussion group held in al-Rahman Mosque. We went with the  police to break up the gathering after meeting the group's amir  at the time, Salah Rajab. I published announcements in the  newspapers asking the members of these groups to repent and turn  themselves in. I succeeded in handing over more than 150 members  in Dayrut, foremost among them the amir of Dayrut, Khalid Sa'd.    [AL-AHRAM] Why is the violence in Dayrut greater than in the  other cities of Asyut [governorate]?    [Al-Kilani] Social problems and material conditions lead  young people to join the terrorist groups.    [AL-AHRAM] What role have you played in confronting these  problems?    [Al-Kilani] Thirteen months ago I called for a project to  help 17,000 graduates, 7,000 of them from Dayrut. We made a  thorough study of 10,000 feddans of desert that could be  irrigated and farmed. Such projects serve young people who have  been waiting 10 years for government employment. The Islamic  Group is trying to enlist these needy youths. They join the  groups in return for money from which they can pay personal  expenses!    We were not slow to help illiteracy. Many of the guardians  of  members of the groups would come to hand over their sons through  me. Our role as People's Assembly members makes for double  responsibility between the people of my constituency and  security officials. I have asked the latter to open the Dayrut  youth center to young people and move the concentration of  armored vehicles away from it. This in fact took place a few  days ago. Nowadays, Dayrut is undisturbed by the terrorist  operations that flared up two years ago.  <H5>  Trust Required </H5>   We went to Jamil Abu-'Aqrab, the People's Assembly member in  Abu Tij, and asked him:    [AL-AHRAM] The charge leveled against you is that you did  not  help to apprehend your cousin 'Abd-al-Hamid, the leader of the  terrorist groups' military wing, when he was charged with the  assassination of Major General al-Shimi last year.    [Abu-'Aqrab] If I see 'Abd-al-Hamid, I will hand him over to  the police. I will not cover up any person, however close his  kinship, who disrupts the peace and is a tool to threaten the  regime. The accused is a fugitive who has not been present in  the city since the crime in which he participated. Our  relationship with him is in the name of his grandfather; he is  not my cousin. All the same, he is a germ that shall be rooted  out of our family. I am revealing no secret if I say that if he  got hold of me he would kill me!    [AL-AHRAM] But in general you are not among those who are  helping the police.    [Abu-'Aqrab] I think I am one of the members of parliament  who spend most of their time helping the police, providing them  with advice and needed information from our various sources.    [AL-AHRAM] A dispute is said to have occurred between you  and  the governor of Asyut because of your not cooperating with the  police.    [Abu-'Aqrab] Our relations with Governor Samih al-Sa'id are  good. There is full understanding on all matters. All People's  Assembly and Consultative Council members feel they are backing  the police with all the information they possess. None of them  has ever hesitated in the face of requests by police officers  involving search for a person, access to his home, or the places  to which he may have escaped. We are calling for more trust  between the two sides.  <H5>  Sympathy with Islamic Group </H5>   We went to Shaykh Ramadan Haykal, the chief officer of the  Awqaf [Ministry] in Asyut.    [AL-AHRAM] What role has the Awqaf [Ministry] played in  heading off the extremist current in Asyut?    [Haykal] Our role is to immunize people against extremism.  We  therefore hold periodic meetings with the people. The ulema meet  every Monday with people in the mosques to inform them about  true religion. I don't deny that people at first were  sympathetic with the Islamic Group. However, after they  discovered that what they were doing had a purely political goal  apart from Islam, they broke with them. The Awqaf [Ministry]  sets down a monthly plan of subjects to be raised in the Friday  sermon for each town and city. This is done through a weekly  meeting with the ulema and preachers to agree on the sermon. For  example, preachers had to deal from the pulpit with the recent  events in Sidfa and Abu Tij. This is completely different from  the Friday sermon in other mosques in other cities.    We are not hostile to Muslim young people. It is in their  interest to listen to us, because we know better than they about  the Koran and Prophetic tradition. Unfortunately, the Islamic  Group does not listen to what the ulema say. Indeed, when the  minister of awqaf comes to us, they boycott his meetings. I  don't know why.    [AL-AHRAM] How did the Awqaf Ministry leave al-Rahmah Mosque  to the control of the extremist groups?    [Haykal] Before we speak about al-Rahmah Mosque, we must  know  how the Islamic Group took control of it. At first the Islamic  Group concentrated in the mosque of the Islamic Law Association  (Abu Bakr al-Siddiq). This mosque, with its lecture hall and  student lodging, is one of the largest Islamic complexes. Being  near the university, it became one of the most important centers  for the Islamic Group. They used to spread out all along the  road leading from the mosque to the university and took to  carrying on their activities and meetings inside the Law  Association [mosque]. When the imam assigned by Awqaf tried to  carry out his mission, he collided with the Islamic Group. A  fight broke out between him and the Islamic Group. The Awqaf  called on police officers for assistance, and the Association's  mosque was taken back after bloodshed. So they fled and took  over the privately built al-Rahmah Mosque after expelling its  imam. When we turned to the police, they told us to leave them  alone!    [AL-AHRAM] Finally, Shaykh Ramadan Haykal told us:    [Haykal] Religious education plays no role in the schools.  The religion class is peripheral. The teacher present in the  school is not an example for the students--and religion is  behavior. I am asking for a religious guide in every school to  whom students can turn to ask about any unclear points in  religion. The Egyptian people are genuinely religious, as shown  by the fact that when a child sees his father pray, he does  likewise.    [AL-AHRAM] Education and educational policy in Asyut are in  the prisoner's dock. Where is the role of learning? Is there  commitment? Do the schools lack social workers to serve as  psychological and social analysts to protect against extremism?  We placed all these questions before Ahmad Qasim, the Education  Ministry's undersecretary in Asyut, who leveled with us.    [Qasim] Asyut witnessed a series of strikes at Asyut  University in the late seventies. The movement was very active  in the faculties of education and medicine. The movement abated  under the pressure of expulsion and rustication, but the  activities can still be found in the university. Then they  infiltrated into the schools; they were not from within. We  therefore assigned a security official in all schools--a teacher  to notify ministry provincial headquarters of everything  happening in the school and therefore the people to arrest in  terrorist incidents, whether they were students or teachers.  They have not carried on their activities or propaganda in  school, or we should have known and taken steps against them. I  have instructed school principals of the need to inform me  immediately of any violations, even by teachers. Last year it  happened that two teachers insulted each other during the  morning line-up. I accordingly took the legal step of transfer.    [AL-AHRAM] On what bases are teachers chosen for the job?    [Qasim] The school must approve the teacher's honesty and  integrity. Then the National Security Investigation Bureau is  informed, so that it can investigate his affiliations and  determine his suitability; for teachers educate and spread  values among an entire generation.    [AL-AHRAM] Does the ministry's provincial apparatus lack  social workers?    [Qasim] Society has three enemies: poverty, ignorance, and  disease. These blights must be cured by a comprehensive  development plan. Since we suffer from these problems, the  largest possible number of social workers must be provided in  the schools. Strangely, Asyut's schools suffer an 80 percent  shortage of social workers. This is the most important element  in my plan against terrorism and extremism. I also face a  shortage in the category of social resources and a shortage of  1,500 teachers in science in addition to my requirements.    [AL-AHRAM] How is education playing a role in overcoming the  rise of terrorism?    [Qasim] After the revolution, instances of blood vengeance  were largely overcome. Intensive meetings were held between  Azharites, the police, and influential figures in the country,  and they laid out an overall strategy to treat this social  custom. In order for there to be similar cooperation in treating  the phenomenon of terrorism in Asyut, we are asking for the  following educational plan: reducing class size; abolishing  double sessions; and splitting up schools with over 3,000  students. Also, police personnel should cooperate with  administrations and schools. Security posts should be set up in  the large schools, staffed by police officers, retired officers,  or soldiers. Every preparatory and secondary school must be  provided with a soldier for protection.    [Box, p 3]  <H5>  Illiteracy Plays Role </H5>   There are 545,000 students in Asyut Governorate and 1,219  schools with 62,000 employees. Nevertheless, there is a high  drop-out rate. Fathers merely pay a 5-pound fine if their  children do not attend primary school, so that they can use them  to till the ground or do farm work in return for wages that help  support them.    [Box, p 3]  <H5>  Asyut's Mosques </H5>   There are 955 mosques with imams and ulema in Asyut. There  are 1,650 privately built mosques to which preachers for the  Friday service have been assigned. There are still 300 small  mosques not under the auspices of the Awqaf Ministry or included  in its plan.    This year, 300 private mosques were joined to the Awqaf  Ministry. The ministry plays a limited social role through alms  (zakah) and contributions. It regularly gives about  100,000 pounds a month to 8,000 individuals throughout the  governorate.</p>

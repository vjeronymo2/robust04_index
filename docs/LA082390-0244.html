Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> SKATER TRENARY TO STAY AMATEUR  </P> <P> World figure-skating champion Jill Trenary said today that she will remain an  amateur with a goal of winning a gold medal in the 1992 Olympics.  </P> <P> "Somebody once told me it's not the things you do in your life that you regret,  it's the things you don't do," Trenary said during a news conference at the  Broadmoor Hotel. "So, with that in mind and after a lot of thought, I've  decided to stay in until the '92 Olympics in Albertville (France)."  </P> <P> Trenary, 22, holds the 1990 world and U.S. figure-skating titles. She has won  the national title three times in the last four years.  </P></p>

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / International Company News: IBM will not take up Groupe Bull rights International Business Machines of the US will not subscribe to next year's FFr8.5bn (Dollars 1.44bn) recapitalisation programme for Groupe Bull, the loss-making, state-owned, French computer group, the two companies announced yesterday. The US computer group, which acquired 5.6 per cent of Bull's shares in early 1992, cited 'other financial priorities' for its decision. IBM itself is struggling to cut costs to improve its weak financial performance. The US company is expected to cut tens of thousands of jobs at its European operations over the next 12 months. IBM said, however, that it remained committed to its alliance with Groupe Bull and that the two computer groups would continue to work on joint projects. In particular, IBM said it would continue to collaborate and possibly expand its work with Groupe Bull on Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) microprocessor technology. Bull said other existing industrial agreements, such as the manufacture of circuit boards by Bull for its US partner would also continue. Bull's other principal shareholders, the French state, France Telecom, and NEC, the Japanese electronics group, have agreed to provide their share of the refinancing package. The French computer group, which is on the list of 21 publicly-owned companies slated for sale by the French government has debts of about FFr10bn and has suffered losses of about FFr15bn over the past three years. Bull said yesterday that its board of directors had approved a plan to allow the company's management and staff to participate in the capital of the company. This was described as 'a first step towards privatisation'. Despite IBM's decision, Bull will receive FFr8.5bn in new capital next year. This represents about two-thirds of 1993-1994 commitments announced in October by the French government and France Telecom, the state-owned telecommunications group.</p>

			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Italy wins Malaysia power deal Ansaldo, the state-controlled Italian engineering group, has won a L180bn (Pounds 74m) order for conversion of a gas turbine power plant in Malaysia to a combined cycle, which allows the plant to recover heat from gas turbine exhaust fumes, writes Andrew Hill in Milan. Ansaldo said conversion would allow the plant to generate an additional 100MW of power without raising fuel consumption. The company's subsidiary, Ansaldo Gie, is the lead company in a consortium with Daelim of Korea and Sumitomo of Japan. Ansaldo said its share of the order was worth L110bn. Proton, Malaysia's national car maker, is to assemble up to 50,000 Citroen-based small cars a year under a preliminary accord signed yesterday, writes John Griffiths. The deal, between Automobiles Citroen, Proton and USPD, a joint venture already representing Citroen in Malaysia, provides for Proton initially to assemble kits of Citroen's AX model.</p>

			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant near Denver was put on alert for several  hours because Colorado officials feared that an earthen dam at the facility  might fail, sending herbicide-contaminated water from a holding pond into  suburban water supplies. State health officials said they were more concerned  about the presence of the herbicide atrazine, a possible carcinogen, and  manganese and sulfide, than about "low but measurable" radiation in the water.  Rocky Flats, which manufactures plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons, is  operated for the Department of Energy by Rockwell International Corp. DOE  officials had expressed concern about the earthen dam when heavy rainfall  filled the pond to 75% of capacity. The alert was canceled after an inspector  for the state engineer's office declared the dam was sound.  </P></p>

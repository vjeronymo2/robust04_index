In that case, the refiner or importer would have the statutory baseline as its individual baseline. Although the compliance period for conventional gasoline is annual (as discussed in the proposals and as described in section IX), emissions determined using the complex models are determined on a summer and winter basis. Thus, there are separate anti-dumping summer and winter baseline fuel parameters, which are the statutory summer baseline specified in the Act, and the winter baseline determined by EPA as required by the Act. Few comments were received concerning the proposed annual average statutory baseline (which is a weighted average of the statutory summer and winter baselines, as discussed in the proposals). None of the comments led to a change in the annual average baseline fuel parameter values.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Data Collection and Testing Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sampling requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the February 26, 1993 proposal, EPA proposed minimum sampling requirements in order to ensure that enough gasoline or blendstock samples were taken from which to develop a representative baseline. Namely, for Method 1-type data, at least half of the batches (by number of batches, not volume), or shipments if not batch blended, in a calendar month shall have been tested for a particular parameter. For Methods 2 and 3-type data, at least weekly sampling of continuous blendstock streams and, if blendstocks are produced on a batch basis, sampling of at least half of the batches of each blendstock produced in a month is required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many refining industry commenters protested this proposal claiming that they had sampled based on the April 16, 1992 proposal requiring ``sufficient'' sampling, and that EPA's more specific requirement could void data collected, and the time and money spent. EPA agrees that the sufficient frequency of sampling may vary according to circumstance (such as the degree of variation in operating conditions), and is modifying its latest proposal by accepting, under certain circumstances, data which does not meet the requirements specified above. However, if less than the minimum data is used, the refiner must document, and the auditor verify, why the data is less than the minimum requirements and why it is sufficient in quantity and quality to use in the baseline determination. EPA retains the right to reject use of less than the minimum data if the documentation is incomplete or the justification not technically sound. In all cases, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 75 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  all available samples must be analyzed and the results used in baseline determination if more than the minimum number of samples are available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 75 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  In instances where a sample was mislabeled or improperly tested or where an analysis results in a value which is significantly different from expected values based on operating conditions, etc., the result may be excluded from the baseline calculation. However, all instances of such exclusion must be documented and verified by the auditor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Additionally, EPA is promulgating its proposal to require at least three months worth of both summer and winter data. As discussed in the RIA, this requirement ensures that the collected data covers the typical changes in gasoline composition which occurs across seasons. Although not explicitly stated in the proposal, to better distinguish between summer and winter, summer months shall consist of any month in which gasoline was produced to meet the federal summer volatility requirements. It is not necessary for such low volatility fuel to be produced for the entire month. Winter months are any months which could not be considered summer months.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Post-final rule data collection.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Few comments were received on the February 26, 1993 proposal that if a refiner collects data after promulgation of these regulations, the data must be collected no later than the end of the third month of the first three full months during which summer gasoline is produced by the refiner following promulgation of the final rule. EPA is modifying this provision slightly, requiring only that proof must be given that additional data was needed and indeed was collected after today. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

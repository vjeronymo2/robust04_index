			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / International Company News: Hagemeyer may lift share capital Hagemeyer, the Dutch-based marketing and distribution group, said yesterday it may expand its share capital by roughly 5 per cent later this year, writes Ronald van de Krol in Amsterdam. However, it stressed that a joint venture in the Asia Pacific region with Cosa Liebermann of Switzerland would lift profit per share. The company released first-half figures showing net profit up strongly at Fl 141m (Dollars 80.6m) from Fl 50.6m a year earlier. The figures, in line with forecasts, include Fl 80.9m in after-tax extraordinary gains.</p>

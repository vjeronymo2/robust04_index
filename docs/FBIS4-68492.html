			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with A.P. Kozachenko, chairman of the Chelyabinsk </F> Oblast Committee for Land Resources and Land Development, by Yu.  Fomin, CHELYABINSKIY RABOCHIY correspondent; place and date not  given: "The Great Reallocation Is Not Over, but More Than a  Million Landowners Have Appeared in the Three Years of Land  Reform in the Oblast"]    [Text] [Fomin] Anatoliy Pavlovich, how would you evaluate  the situation with oblast land resources at the beginning of  1994? Has the land reallocation that started in 1990 been  completed?    [Kozachenko] Three years have passed under the sign of a  great reallocation of land. It can be said without exaggeration:  A revolution has taken place in land relationships--the monopoly  of the right of the state to possess land has ended. Given the  total oblast area of 8.8529 million hectares, 3.2081 million  have been transferred to the ownership of citizens, joint-stock  companies, and associations. There has been a transfer of 1.2195  million hectares of land resources to the jurisdiction of city,  settlement, and village administrations that were also earmarked  most of all for personal subsidiary plots, hayfields, and  pastureland.    [Fomin] What does the owner of a land parcel represent today  in a generalized way? How many owners are registered on the  territory of the oblast--private individual proprietors, farmer  and peasant-owned farms, joint-stock companies, and firms? How  much land is left under the jurisdiction of state structures?    [Kozachenko] According to the status on 1 February 1994,  more  than 400,000 subsidiary plots with a total area of 66,700  hectares are registered in the oblast. In three years 40,000  citizens were granted land sectors for an area of 5,200 hectares  for individual housing construction, and of this, 2,600 hectares  were allocated to the ownership of villages and settlements free  of charge.    Seven thousand one hundred and thirty-two peasant farms were  organized on an area of 415,400 hectares, and of these, 90,300  hectares of agricultural land were allocated free of charge, or  21.8 percent of the total area. The remaining area was turned  over for leasing for a period of up to 50 years, with the right  of subsequent redemption.    In an area of 4,291 hectares seven communal-ancestral farms  were organized on which the age-old Cossack principle of land  use is being revived. The communes are operating in Agapovskiy,  Verkhneuralskiy, Kartalinskiy, Krasnoarmeyskiy, Nyazepetrovskiy,  and Sosnovskiy Rayons and the city of Yuzhnouralsk. One hundred  and four hectares of land were turned over to the ownership of  the communes free of charge.    Today 386,700 citizens of our oblast own land plots  earmarked  for gardening. Their total area is 31,400 hectares. All told,  189,400 hectares were transferred to the ownership of more than  800,000 citizens.    Significant changes have occurred in public agriculture. On  the basis of the former kolkhozes and sovkhozes, 215 joint-stock  companies and associations were established, to whom 3.0187  million hectares of agricultural land were turned over to  collective-share and collective-joint ownership. Today we have  23 kolkhozes left that own 3 percent of the agricultural land  and 25 state agricultural enterprises with commodity production  that have 4 percent of the agricultural land. Thus the oblast  disposes of redistribution funds that today amount to 403,600  hectares, or a total of 5.5 percent of the agricultural land. A  large part of this fund has been turned over to leasing, to  temporary use by agricultural enterprises, and to farmers.    These are the results of our work: 84.5 percent of the  agricultural land of the oblast has been transferred to citizen  or collective ownership. The total number of landowners and land  users is more than 1.71 million.    [Fomin] Anatoliy Pavlovich, in what condition is the land  cadastre of the oblast?    [Kozachenko] In accordance with a government decree, owing  to  the resources received from payments from land, we have begun  work on inventorying land of population centers and the  establishment of six automated cadastre bureaus: three--in rural  rayons--of the most numerous land users (Sosnovskiy,  Krasnoarmeyskiy, Chebarkulskiy) and three in the cities of  Chelyabinsk, Magnitogorsk, and Miass. The oblast committee has  organized work for the establishment of program support of the  cadastre. We will continue this work in 1994, and its results  will depend on the volume of financing. We prepare an annual  report on the status of the land fund of the oblast, and can  provide full information on any rayon. Incidentally, this  material can be used by any organizations that work with land.  Although I will note that it is difficult to set up proper  registration without the establishment of an automated system of  land cadastre.    Last year the oblast land committee developed a program for  monitoring land in Chelyabinsk Oblast. Fifteen scientific  production organizations were involved in implementation of the  program. Five stationary sites for conducting regular  observations over the status of land resources of the oblast  were set up in various nature-climatic zones. This will make it  possible to more fully evaluate the influence of economic  activity on the condition of the environment.    [Fomin] On 29 September 1993 CHELYABINSK RABOCHIY talked  about pseudo-farmers in the Uvelskiy Rayon, about people who  became owners of land but actually did not work on it. How did  your committee react to this article? Is there an effective  system for monitoring the rational use of land resources  according to the law at the present time?    [Kozachenko] As in any business, we unfortunately are not  without deficiencies. Yes, your newspapers wrote about the  pseudo-farmers in Uvelskiy Rayon, about those people who  received land parcels but did not intend to work on them  themselves. The rayon land committee sent each one of them a  written warning, first of all to those who came under the action  of the Edict of the President of the Russian Federation of 4  April 1992 No. 361 "On the Fight Against Corruption in the Civil  Service System." However, the procurator of the rayon in his  presentation explained to the committee about exceeding  authority in the resolution of these questions. Thus, farmers  like this have their defenders, although the land committee is  undertaking decisive measures in the fight against the violation  of land legislation and in monitoring the rational and effective  use of land.    As a result of such checks, decrees were published by the  heads of administration of Yetkulskiy and Chebarkulskiy Rayons  concerning the elimination of the subsidiary plot Groznetskoye  of the trust Uralneftegazstroy consisting of an area of 2,444  hectares and the transfer of the confiscated land to the  Karatabanskiy sovkhoz for agricultural use, and also concerning  the confiscation of 150 hectares of arable land from oblast  psychoneurological hospital No. 2 and their transfer to the  rayon redistribution fund.    According to materials of land inventories conducted in  1993,  800 hectares of ineffectively used land were identified on the  territory of Yetkulskiy and Sosnovskiy Rayons and transferred to  the redistribution fund.    Regarding the Petushok horticultural association, the oblast  committee prepared materials, and a decree of the head of  administration of Sosnovskiy Rayon was adopted on the  confiscation of land parcels from horticulturists who did not  begin to develop the land parcels in three years.    [Fomin] The editorial mail brings us information that  ordinary citizens at times are unable to gain possession of land  for personal plots and land shares in joint-stock companies.  Ivan Danilovich Pigarev from the village of Nagaybakskiy writes,  in particular, that he used a personal plot of 0.50 hectares for  36 years (he is a participant of the war), and now he is being  given only 0.16 hectares. Valentina Aleksandrovna Lukyan worked  for 23 years on the Belonosovskiy sovkhoz. But she took a  pension in another place. She was refused a land share by the  Belonosovskiy joint-stock company. In brief, what can you say to  these people?    [Kozachenko] Commenting on these letters, I can say that in  neither case did officials violate land legislation with respect  to them. However, it is possible to help these citizens. I.D.  Pigarev can receive for his personal plot a section of land  outside the boundaries of the construction project of the  village, and V.A. Lukyan, if she is able to work the land, can  get an average rayon share free of charge for the organization  of a peasant farm in accordance with Article 60 of the Land Code  of the Russian Federation from the lands of the rayon's special  fund.    [Fomin] In October 1993 the Edict of the President of Russia  "On Regulating Land Relations and Development of Agrarian Reform  in Russia," which granted owners right to sell land plots, was  signed. When will the first competition (auction) on the sale of  land be held in the oblast? What will be offered for sale to  those who take part in it?    [Kozachenko] Of late, more and more citizens have become  interested in questions about the purchase and sale of land  parcels. The Law of the Russian Federation "On the Right of  Citizens of the Russian Federation To Receive Private Property  and To Sell Land Parcels for the Conduct of Personal Subsidiary  and Summer Home Farming, Gardening, and Individual Housing  Construction" grants the right to citizens who received land  parcels as private property for the aforementioned purposes to  sell them to other citizens of Russia. This right is affirmed by  the Edict of the President of the Russian Federation "On  Regulating Land Relations and Development of Agrarian Reform in  Russia." Purchase and sale of land transactions are conducted by  citizens independently at the place of the location of the  parcels with the formulation of a deed of purchase.    Land parcels belonging to citizens as personal property will  be sold at auctions on their petition. Moreover, the organs of  local administration can offer for sale at auction vacant  parcels that are valuable because of their location for  individual housing construction, the accommodation of summer  homes, and other purposes.    The edict of the president of the Russian Federation  authorizes the sale of land parcels acquired by citizens free of  charge in the form of shares in the reorganization of kolkhozes  and sovkhozes. However, the lack of a sale-purchase mechanism  for lands of agricultural significance hinders this process. On  the whole it must be said that land legislation has begun to lag  behind today's practical tasks.</p>

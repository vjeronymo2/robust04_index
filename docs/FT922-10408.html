			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Technology: Kebabs, kebabs and more kebabs - Worth Watching As every cook knows making kebabs can be a time-consuming process, especially if the requirement is for thousands and not just a handful. Nijal, a French company, has produced the first automated system for producing kebabs, capable of producing a mould of compressed meat every 40 seconds and up to 7,500 kebabs weighing 100 grams each an hour. Food such as beef, pork, chicken or fish is placed in a mould and compressed. It then enters the machine where the meat is skewered, centred and cut into kebabs. The production process is controlled by a programmable logic controller with the number of kebabs produced displayed on screen. In addition, the process produces no waste. Nijal: France, 31 4297 0625.</p>

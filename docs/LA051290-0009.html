			<p><P> May 12, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: PORT HUENEME;  </P> <P> DISTRICT REJECTS YEAR-ROUND SCHOOLS  </P> <P> The Hueneme School District has decided against implementing a year-round  schedule until at least the mid-1990s.  </P> <P> The district, made up of nine elementary and two junior high schools in Oxnard  and Port Hueneme, has experienced steady growth in enrollment during the past  three years, climbing from 6,889 in 1986-87 to the present level of 7,150.  </P> <P> District spokesman Don Cody said the student population is expected to grow by  the 1994-95 school year by only 466 students. He said families with young  children will probably be unable to afford the area's high cost of housing.  </P> <P> Cody said the district has been able to handle recent growth by utilizing  portable classrooms. He said four more are expected to be added in 1990-91,  bringing the district's total to 18. SCOTT LAWRENCE  </P></p>

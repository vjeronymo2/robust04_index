			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Survey of Republic of Slovenia (6): Legislative fillip sought - The Stock Exchange IF traders at Ljubljana's small but lively stock exchange could choose a present to celebrate the second anniversary of the Borza's opening on March 29, 1990, they would probably opt for a new batch of legislation which would speed up privatisation and foreign investment. 'New legislation would give the exchange a real fillip. We still have to develop Slovenia's financial infrastructure and financial instrument,' said Mr Drasko Veselinovic, 33, vice-chairman and chief executive officer of the Borza, which is located on the sixth floor of a high-rise office block in the centre of the capital. Despite the slow pace of the economic reforms, the Borza is thriving. 'There is an enormous interest in the exchange,' said Mr Veselinovic. On a typical trading day - it is open twice a week on Tuesdays and Thursdays - the trading floor is packed with young and old, men and women, standing around the central trading desk. More significantly, at the other end of the floor, space has been set aside for the public which keenly follows the day's prices. Outside on the street, exchange prices flash across a large electronic screen. 'We keep the public informed. It is the only way to attract interest and promote awareness of the market economy,' said Mr Veselinovic. The Borza has 30 securities listed, of which five are stocks and the rest consist of bonds issued by the government, municipal councils, or commercial institutions. The bonds can be traded in all denominations of foreign currency but, because the Slovene Tolar, the unit of currency, is pegged to the D-Mark, trading in Deutsche Marks account for 95 per cent of total volume. Payments are made in Tolars. The stocks include a private bank in the neighbouring republic of Croatia, the Mladinska Kniga, Slovenia's large publishing house, and the SKB bank, the republic's second-largest bank. Last year, market capitalisation was Dollars 600m and the annual turnover totalled DM106m. But Mr Veselinovic says that daily turnover in recent weeks has amounted to DM2m. 'This is quite a substantial increase. It is partly due to the launch of a gold product - bars, coins and commemorative medals. Can you imagine what the exchange would be like if the government started selling off those 1,600 state-owned companies,?' he asked rhetorically. In common with other exchanges, Ljubljana's Borza has a 'clausus', which stipulates that no share can rise or fall above or below 20 per cent in any single trading day. But with such a high clausus, is there not a danger of inhibiting risk-taking? 'Not at all,' explained Mr Veselinovic. 'We have no choice, given the rate of inflation which is running at between 10 and 12 per cent a month.' Inflation, and the absence of legislation in other areas of the economy, has not deterred the exchange from opening its floor to foreign investors. 'There are no limitations for foreign members who want to trade here. All they have to have is a legal branch here. The Borza is open to all hard currency accounts. Investors can take their dividends freely out of the republic - subject to a withholding tax - and they can be paid in the currency in which they originally traded,' said Mr Veselinovic. However, the foreign exchange law has yet to allow the listing of foreign securities, but it does permit the issuing of securities by joint ventures or foreign-owned companies which are based in Slovenia. Moreover, the exchange's founding statutes are restrictive in the sense that ownership is in the hands of the banks, which are only allowed to buy shares in the Borza. Ljubljanska Banka, Slovenia's largest bank, holds 30 per cent of the exchange's total capital. However, there are plans to widen this ownership structure through allowing new shareholders such as insurance companies and pension funds Mr Veselinovic and his colleagues believe that once the privatisation law is passed, the Borza will really thrive. 'We are already preparing for this. We are looking for new and bigger premises. In a year's time, we will have in place a complete electronic system,' he explained. He added: 'I suppose we were ahead of time when we first opened. But then, we couldn't wait around, waiting for things to happen, could we?'</p>

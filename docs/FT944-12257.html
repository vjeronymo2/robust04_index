			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Marks to cut holding in French Connection Mr Stephen Marks, founder and chief executive of French Connection, is cutting his stake in the fashion company from 75 to 65 per cent. He is selling 329,000 shares and the company is making a placing to raise Pounds 4.53m net. NatWest Wood Mackenzie, the company's broker, is placing 2.02m shares with institutions at 233p, the same price at which Mr Marks is selling. The shares rose 1p yesterday to 244p. Mr Nicholas Mather, finance director, said that for the group to move up from the USM to the main market - expected within 18 months - 25 per cent of the shares had to be held outside the company. There was a need to 'normalise the capital structure and strengthen the balance sheet', he added. Further, the institutional shareholder base needed rebuilding. Mr Mather said that at some point French Connection was going to have to repay Mr Marks Pounds 3.55m, which he loaned to the company in two tranches. In 1989 he lent Pounds 1.55m as a condition for the company's bankers supporting a rescue plan. In 1992 he advanced a further Pounds 2m as part of new banking facilities. Now that French Connection had recovered - in the six months to July 31 pre-tax profits rose 53 per cent to Pounds 3.07m on turnover up 14 per cent at Pounds 34.7m - the board decided it should not delay making the repayment, especially as interest on the second tranche became payable in April 1994.</p>

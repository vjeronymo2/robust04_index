			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Survey of Courier and Express Services (1): It's a global business - Many observers believe the European express market will be dominated by the major groups, which can benefit most from economies of scale. Meanwhile, the amount of investment needed to keep abreast of developments puts profit margins under pressure THE COURIER and express industry is attracting political attention both in the UK and the broader European market. In the UK, the government plans to privatise both the Royal Mail parcels division Parcelforce, either separately or as part of a more general privatisation of postal services, and its British Rail counterpart Red Star. A decision on the nature and timetable of the Royal Mail/Parcelforce privatisation had been expected around now. But Government sources indicated last month that privatisation moves are now unlikely before 1994. Last July, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, announced that it was intended to sell Parcelforce as a separate unit. Since then, there has been something of a rethink, and Royal Mail and Parcelforce could be sold off as one unit. Red Star, though, looks certain to be sold separately from the rest of British Rail, and is likely to be the first significant part of BR to take that route. Among the potential bidders are two groups of current or recent senior Red Star managers. On the European front, the European Council of Ministers was this month due to discuss a European Commission Green Paper on the future of postal services. The discussions could have considerable implications for future EC courier/express service development. Meanwhile, the European Commission is investigating courier industry allegations that seven national post offices are abusing EC competition laws and hampering some aspects of their business. The International Express Couriers Conference (IECC) has complained that the post offices of the UK, Belgium, France, Germany, Finland, Switzerland and Sweden are deliberately slowing down private sector re-mail operations. That business involves courier mail from one country being reposted in the postal system of another to take advantage of cost savings. Regardless of the truth or otherwise of those allegations, post offices generally are becoming much more commercial in their thinking on the development of mail, courier and express services. Highlighting that trend is the 18-month old joint venture between postal organisation GD Net, the express company established by the post offices of Germany, France, the Netherlands, Sweden and Canada, and TNT Express Worldwide, a private sector operator. The GD Net/TNT venture helps to illustrate the importance of size and traffic volumes as a factor in the express industry's development. With delivery systems generating substantial fixed costs, any increase in traffic volumes rapidly produces significant economies of scale. Mr Tony Keating, European logistics director for US-based parcels giant United Parcel Service (UPS), maintains that in Europe, for instance, rates should come down as volumes increase and the industry develops along similar lines to that in the US. 'The traditional structure of parcel groupage and forwarding operations in Europe will, I believe, change just as they have in the US. With this change, I foresee service levels increasing year by year. At the same time, we should see rates coming down from current levels to far nearer the costs of similar movements in the US,' he says. In the light of that likely development, many express industry observers believe the European market will increasingly be dominated by the major groups who can benefit most from economies of scale. In the last five years, there have been numerous cases of domestic parcels delivery companies coming unstuck while trying to develop their own operations in Europe. But a number of leading domestic express companies still believe they can compete in the European market through partnerships. One of the most pronounced international trends is the move by major service operators to expand their activities to include more comprehensive logistics activities. The big four global express companies - TNT, UPS, DHL Worldwide Express and Federal Express - now have special divisions or management teams dedicated to developing full logistics services for multinational customers. This trend is fuelled by the attempt of multinational manufacturers to restructure their logistics activities to reflect the increasingly global nature of their sourcing and distribution activities. Fast, reliable delivery services are often a key component of those operations. At the same time, express companies are also broadening the scope of their standard delivery services. The express industry is introducing more added-value services, such as inventory management, order fulfilment and expedited shipping programmes for high-value or time-sensitive goods. But the most significant general area of 'added value' service development involves information technology, particularly the establishment of new EDI (electronic data interchange) links between customers, carriers, Customs and other organisations. Tight operational control and fast reporting of management information is now very much the name of the game, and express operators are investing millions of dollars in new computerised control, tracking and reporting systems. TNT, for example, earlier this year placed a multi-million dollar order for new computers with Hewlett-Packard. The order involves more than 200 HP 9000 Series 800 computer systems, which will be installed in 35 countries. Another big spender in the information technology field is UPS. The company has invested about Dollars 1.5bn in new IT development over the last few years. This year, it introduced a cellular technology, nationwide mobile data service in the US, which will enable UPS to transmit package delivery information from its 50,000 delivery vehicles for immediate customer access. The system, said to be the largest of its kind in the world, has cost about Dollars 150m to implement. Domestic express companies, too, are investing heavily in IT. Birmingham-based UK national carrier Elan recently spent Pounds 2m to improve its own internal systems and provide additional benefits to customers. In Europe, the pace of information technology and general express industry development is being further accelerated by the advent of the EC Single Market. As manufacturers and suppliers make greater use of centralised warehousing/distribution, they increasingly require fast, frequent, reliable delivery. Other developments are inspired by the coming of the EC Single Market. They include a renewed focus on the use of road transport. Removal of border controls within the Community now makes most markets accessible by truck within two days. Encouraged by this development, express companies are stepping up their use of roadservices, thereby freeing costly air systems for urgent traffic. TNT, UPS, Emery Worldwide and Air Express International are among the big air express operators who already have such road-based operations and DHL is thinking of joining them. However, the sheer scale of the investment needed to keep abreast of the latest developments in a fast-changing industry, coupled with the high costs of fixed operational systems, means that operators' profit margins remain under heavy pressure. Even some of the largest operators are incurring big losses in some of their activities.</p>

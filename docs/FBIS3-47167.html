One of the additions, which has been tentatively named the  "Economic Cooperation and Environment Bureau," will handle talks  with developing countries.    The "Economic Organizations Bureau" will take up  multilateral  negotiations such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  (GATT), World Trade Organization (WTO), Organization for  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and U.N. Development  Program (UNDP).    The current International Trade Bureau will be responsible  for bilateral trade negotiations with added functions in  aviation and maritime talks, officials said.    The changes will be proposed to President Kim Yong-sam in  the  ministry's New Year report Jan. 21.    The ministry is considering hiring Koreans with foreign  citizenship for the new bureaus to promote South Korean  participation in multilateral trade organizations, according to  the officials.    This plan calls for hiring 50 to 100 people of Korean  ancestry with degrees in economics and professional backgrounds  in related fields. They will be placed at the foreign and other  ministries.</p>

			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Customs' move angers brewers THE ROW between Customs and Excise officials and the Brewers' Society erupted again yesterday over Customs' statements that the new system of beer duty introduced earlier this month would not penalise brewers but bring them 'a bonus of millions'. Brewers protested two weeks ago that the system - under which duty is charged on the alcoholic strength of the finished product - would increase the industry's tax burden by Pounds 64m a year. Bass, Courage, and Carlsberg-Tetley, the UK's three leading brewers, announced reductions in the strength of a number of beer brands to ease the impact. However, in a statement yesterday, Customs and Excise said switching the duty charge from an earlier production stage would produce a one-off cashflow benefit to the industry of Pounds 200m.</p>

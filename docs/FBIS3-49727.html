			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, Jan 13 (TANJUG) -- Yasushi Akashi,  civilian head of the UN peace-keeping force in former Yugoslavia  said Thursday [13 January] that he was encouraged by  Yugoslavia's positive stand towards the problems faced by the UN  Peacekeeping Forces (UNPROFOR) in former Yugoslavia. We  discussed bilateral issues and the Yugoslav Prime Minister  Kontic adopted a positive stand towards the problems faced by  UNPROFOR, the UN secretary-general's envoy told a press  conference after his meeting with the Yugoslav prime minister in  Belgrade.    Kontic on his part expressed his satisfaction that a man  from  Japan, country which has always led a principled policy towards  the crisis in former Yugoslavia, had come to head the UNPROFOR.  Akashi told Kontic that he was aware that some of the UN  Security Council decisions had caused the suffering of the  Yugoslav population which was all the more reason why solutions  had to be found that would lead to their cancellation.    The United Nations had introduced sanctions against  Yugoslavia in May 1992 because of its alleged involvement in the  civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, even though Yugoslavia has no  troops in that republic. Akashi also informed Kontic that the  Security Council sanctions committee had simplified the  procedure for obtaining authorisations for food and medicine  imports and that this procedure now took only a few days instead  of weeks or months.    The Japanese diplomat also said that NATO had asked UNPROFOR  to prepare a feasibility study on carrying out air strikes on  Serb positions in Bosnia-Herzegovina. At the beginning of this  week, NATO had threatened the Bosnian Serbs with air strikes in  order to stop the bombing of Sarajevo, secure the opening of  Tuzla airport and the relief of the UN Canadian contingent in  Srebrenica, a Moslem enclave in east Bosnia-Herzegovina.    However, it is the Moslems who are responsible for the  clashes in Sarajevo. According to the UNPROFOR commander in  Bosnia-Herzegovina General Francis Briquemont, they launched  unprovoked attacks on Serb suburbs in Sarajevo on Tuesday. The  Bosnian Serbs think that the opening of the Tuzla airport is not  possible before the Moslem side signs a peace plan for  Bosnia-Herzegovina because they fear that the Moslems would use  the Tuzla airport, just like they did the Sarajevo airport, for  the contraband of arms for their army.    Bosnian Serb leaders also said that their forces were not  besieging the UNPROFOR Canadian battalion in Srebrenica and that  their request to be freed is unfounded. Akashi said that  UNPROFOR had still not completed the feasibility study on the  air strikes, adding that he was leaving for Geneva on Sunday to  meet the UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. Akashi said  that he was responsible for the territory of the former Yugoslav  republics and that he would help the negotiators as much as he  could because they would rely on on-ground information. He  expressed hope that this information would help and contribute  to reaching positive results.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Colin King] </F>   [Text] Georgetown, Guyana, 31 Dec, CANA -- The Cheddi Jagan  government has moved to parliament, seeking to dissolve the  Georgetown City Council and set up an interim management body to  run the affairs of the city.    A municipal councils (temporary provisions) bill 1993, was  tabled in the National Assembly Thursday.    This becomes law, the Georgetown council will be scrapped  and  an interim management committee appointed by the minister.  [sentence as received]    The other municipal bodies -- town councils of Linden, New  Amsterdam, Rose Hall and Corriverton -- would continue in office  until their elections are held, provided these elections are  held before July 31, 1994. In the event the elections for the  four town councils are not held by the stipulated date, then  interim management committees would be required from the same  date.    But the parliamentary opposition Working People's Alliance  wants all five municipal councils to be dissolved. At the final  sitting of the house Thursday, the wpa charged that with  elections overdue, councils malfunctioning and service to  citizens deteriorating, there was a "crisis" in local government.    The WPA called for the dissolution of "all local government  councils in Georgetown, the towns and throughout the rural  community". The party said parliamentary parties should arrive  at consensus on the appointment of "interim management  councils...to execute the first stage of a programme of  municipal rehabilitation". But added that in the absence of  constitutional reform to allow a "workable" system of local  government, it would be unwilling to contest any elections.    Guyana's five municipal councils were appointed by the  previous People's National Congress (PNC) government after  uncontested municipal elections in 1992. The councils were then  asked by the new goverment to remain in office for an extra year  ending December 1993, after delays in the election date.    A date for fresh municipal elections is still to be set.    The Jagan administration has since been at loggerheads with  the Georgetown council, saying it has been showing "a growing  paralysis and dysfunctioning", and does not have the support of  citizens.    The National Assembly is expected to resume sitting in the  second week of January, when the bill could come up for debate.</p>

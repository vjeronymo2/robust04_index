			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Ethigen Corp. said it renamed its AL-721 food supplement Altrigen in an effort  "to end confusion created by bootleggers" selling purportedly similar egg  lecithin products. AL-721 and its imitators are widely used by AIDS patients  and others infected with the human immunodeficiency virus in the hope of  slowing disease progression. Ethigen sells the product over the counter in  selected pharmacies; the imitation products are sold through health-food stores  and buyers' clubs that have sprung up in the wake of the epidemic. Many AIDS  experts are skeptical that the products work.  </P></p>

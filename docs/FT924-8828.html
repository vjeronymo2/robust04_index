			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Japanese Equity Warrants: Issuers forced to seek more capital for repayment REFINANCING the Japanese equity warrant binge of the late 1980s may cause less of a log-jam in the public capital markets than expected, if experience so far is any guide. The rush started in earnest this summer. After running at around Dollars 1.5bn-Dollars 2bn a quarter, the value of warrant bonds falling due leaped to Dollars 8bn in the March-June period and Dollars 14bn in the following three months. Most of the warrants have expired worthless, forcing the issuers to raise additional capital to repay bondholders. Yet the markets have so far taken it in their stride: against a background of inactivity in the equity-linked sector of the Euromarkets, and without any significant pick-up in the Japanese domestic corporate bond market, many issuers have turned to commercial paper or private placements to plug the gaps. The crunch year will be 1993, when some Dollars 75bn of such issues mature, according to figures from IFR Securities Data. Equity warrant issues, which typically have a four-year maturity, peaked in popularity in 1989 with Japanese issuers attracted by very cheap financing, and with Japanese retail investors eager to place their shirts on what looked like a one-way bet. Of the 13 deals the market has seen worth Dollars 1bn or more, all but one were in 1989. The slump in the Tokyo stock market means that warrants linked to deals brought out around that time are not being exercised and the issuers are having to face up to refinancing the bonds. There are five main avenues to explore for refinancing purposes: like-for-like equity warrant issues, convertible bonds, Euroyen bonds, straight bonds in the domestic market and bank loans. In addition, medium-term notes and commercial paper could be used as a temporary measure. Companies like Toyota might, it is thought, simply redeem the bonds out of their petty cash. The exact distribution of the refinancing burden will depend upon prevailing market conditions and the differing requirements of the borrowers, but it is probably safe to say that bank loans will be the smallest part of the solution, given the problems Japanese banks are having with their loan books and the constraints imposed by capital adequacy guidelines. Straight Eurodollar issues are being ruled out for all but the best known names with good ratings. Nor has the domestic bond market come to the rescue of warrant bond issuers. Liberalisation measures, designed to make the market more accessible to Japanese companies, have so far failed to prompt issuance on a large scale. 'Efforts to stimulate domestic issuance by the Ministry of Finance may fall short of meeting Japanese issuers' real needs,' concludes Moody's Investors Service, the rating agency, in a report on the Japanese shelf registration system. Refinancings in the warrant market have also been running at a very low ebb this year. Just Dollars 9bn of warrant bonds were issued in the first nine months, only a third of the amount raised in the same period in 1991. Most bankers agree that the market, while still fragile, is strong enough to absorb considerably more than this - say Dollars 20bn-Dollars 30bn of new issues a year. According to Mr Doug Howland, of Goldman Sachs: 'The warrant market remains a viable sector with a good investor base. Demand is outstripping the current limited supply, notwithstanding the recent softness in the new issue market.' The buyer profile today looks very different from 1989, when around three-quarters of the warrants quickly flowed back to Japanese retail investors. Today, according to some estimates, 50 per cent is being bought by UK institutions, 30 per cent by continental Europe including Switzerland and just 10 per cent by Japan. 'Japan looks attractive now,' says Mr Paul Sauvary, deputy chief executive of Schroder Securities. 'To have a four-year option on Japanese stock at this stage in the cycle has to look an attractive investment.' Issuers and their bankers will be hoping that this message is getting through: according to one estimate, some Dollars 3bn of warrant-linked issues is scheduled for the coming weeks, representing a sudden pick-up after a very quiet year. Sumitomo Rubber and Canon are among the biggest issuers waiting in the wings. In the meantime, private placements and the US commercial paper market have been used to take much of the strain of the refinancing wave, as public markets have shrunk in significance. The saviour for the original warrant bond issuers would, of course, be a revival in the Tokyo market. Baring Securities says that the Nikkei would have to recover to 33,000 from today's levels of around 17,000 to make any significant reductions in the amount of debt that needs to be refinanced. But the message from one Japanese banker in London is to forget it. 'Issuers will not be bailed out by a recovery in the stock market.'</p>

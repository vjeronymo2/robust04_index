			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: Door is ajar but floor space is a predicament - Taiwan's investment liberalisation When Taiwan announced earlier this year that foreign securities houses could apply to open a full-service branch or a wholly-owned subsidiary for the first time in many years, foreign brokers were elated - until they they discovered that there was a catch. 'They're giving us national treatment, which is great,' says the head of one foreign brokerage's Taipei office. 'But according to the letter of the law, it's nearly impossible to find an office space that is both suitable and which meets government criteria.' In recent interviews, officials have outlined plans to open up the local securities industry gradually to foreigners as part of the country's bid to join the future World Trade Organisation, and to become a regional financial centre. But the office-space predicament illustrates how liberalisation measures can hit snags at the level of implementation. The Taipei municipal government decreed in December 1993 that, for safety reasons, financial companies must be located in ground-floor or basement space unless they are in commercially-zoned areas. Quality Taipei office space is mostly zoned as mixed-residential, and rents for street-level space in prime business districts are prohibitive. The measure is intended for local companies with retail operations, but the business of foreign securities houses is wholesale. Mr Kuei Hsien-nung, a section chief at Taiwan's Securities and Exchange Commission, dismisses foreign brokers' concerns. 'They don't need to worry. It's just a regulation; it can be changed very fast.' A flurry of consultations among goverment departments are under way, and the matter will be resolved shortly, he says. While timetables remain elusive and snags are sure to crop up the government, nonetheless, is committed to a long-term, step-by-step liberalisation programme. In 1983, the authorities gave the green light to overseas-listed funds, marking the opening of indirect foreign investment in Taiwan shares. In 1990, approved foreign institutions were permitted to invest directly in local stocks, subject to certain limits. The next phase, says the vice-minister of finance, Mr Chang Chan-pang, will be to open the market to foreign individual investors. 'We are now considering this,' he says. 'But we have to choose the right time: we have never set a timetable.' Regulations are steadily being loosened, investment ceilings raised and restrictions on capital flows and repatriation of profits eased. 'Some people may ask, why don't we get rid of all restrictions immediately? Of course, we welcome foreign investment, but we must watch the stability of our domestic financial markets,' Mr Chang says. By the end of June, 67 foreign institutional investors had been approved to invest USDollars 5.6bn in local securities and Dollars 4.7bn had been placed, Of that, 75 per cent, or Dollars 3.5bn was invested in stocks with the remainder in bonds or time deposits. Total market capitalisation as of June 30 was Dollars 199bn. The Central Bank of China recently raised the overall ceiling on direct foreign investment in the local bourse to Dollars 7.5bn from Dollars 5.0bn, and set a limit of Dollars 2.5bn on indirect foreign investment. Late last year, a cap of Dollars 3bn was set on the amount of funds that can be raised through overseas issues such as convertible bonds and global depository receipts. Officials say that these ceilings will be raised if needed. There is a cap of 10 per cent on aggregate foreign holdings in any individual stock and a 5 per cent limit for a single foreign shareholder. Mr Chang predicts that these ownership limits could be lifted to between 15 and 25 per cent, and 10 per cent respectively, in a few months. However Mr Day Linin, chairman of the SEC, believes that the 5 and 10 per cent foreign ownership ceilings could be eliminated entirely by the end of this year, except in strategic industries. Mr Day says that the plan is to make regulatory treatment of foreign portfolio investment the same as for equity investment. 'Unlike some countries, our portfolio investment regulations are stricter than those for equity investment,' he says. Changes have been agreed but await approval. The SEC chief concedes that permission for individual foreigners to invest directly remains a way off. He points out that individual foreigners have already become sizeable investors in listed companies by having bought equity in firms before they went public. There is currently a debate within the government over whether holders of convertible bonds issued overseas should be permitted to convert them into listed shares. Mr Day predicts that regulations will be revised to allow conversion by the end of this year at the latest. Unapproved foreign investors in such instruments would be allowed to hold the shares after conversion, but once sold could not buy back into the market. Mr Day's short-term goal is to raise the ceiling on foreign investment in local shares to 10 per cent of total market capitalisation, rising later to 25 per cent and eventually eliminating restrictions altogether. The central bank has agreed in principle, he said, but no timetable has been set. Foreign investment, including indirect holdings, is about three per cent of the market.</p>

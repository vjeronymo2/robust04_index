			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / CDs push down vinyl disc sales to 3% Compact discs have driven down the UK market share of music recorded on vinyl to little more than 3 per cent in 12 years, says a study from the Datamonitor market research consultancy. In 1982, when compact discs were launched, 65 per cent of recorded music sales were on vinyl discs. Datamonitor predicts that vinyl will 'soon be a thing of the past'. Most big music companies and retailers no longer make or sell albums or singles on vinyl, now restricted to a cult market of disc jockeys and collectors. Sales of CDs have risen almost as quickly as those of vinyl have fallen. After five years on the market, CDs represented 12.6 per cent of recording sales in 1987 and claimed 60.5 per cent last year. Audio cassettes accounted for 36.3 per cent of the market last year. Datamonitor believes CDs will continue to gain share because only 37 per cent of UK homes have a CD player. Future sales will be stimulated as more households buy players and replace their old vinyl record collections with CDs. UK Records &amp; Tapes. Datamonitor, 106 Baker Street, London W1M 1LA. Pounds 395.</p>

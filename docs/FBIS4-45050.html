			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ya'aqov Edelstein] </F>   [Text] Britain, which previously canceled the ban on  selling oil to Israel, has announced that she is lifting her  embargo on buying Israeli arms. The embargo was imposed by the  European Community in 1982 after the IDF's [Israel Defense  Forces] invasion of Lebanon, but most EC members had long since  rescinded the ban. Britain left it in effect, insisting that the  IDF withdraw from the security zone. Although Britain has lifted  the prohibition on buying arms from Israel, she has not actually  bought any weapons because of the embargo.    Why are the British more extreme in this matter than the  other European countries? It may be that the answer to this must  be sought in the remote past, when Britain conducted policy in  Mandate Palestine by calculating the worth of relations with the  Arab states and the Arab world. It was a question not of  principle but of practical considerations. The reason given for  the recent decision to lift the embargo was the positive  developments in the peace process in the Middle East,  "especially in light of the IDF's withdrawal from Gaza and  Jericho." The decision was made following an extended lobbying  visit by Rabin, Peres, Beilin, and their assistants. Beilin, who  met with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, told him that  Britain's decision to maintain the embargo so long as no  progress occurred in the negotiations with Lebanon, was absurd  because such progress depends on Syria. Moreover, Israel made  clear that she has no territorial demands on Lebanon.    We glean from these events that Britain lags behind European  nations in her conservative policy. This is also fundamentally a  pro-Arab policy, to the point of imposing conditions for every  development in relations with Israel. The British seem to forget  that Israel no longer is a land under the control of the British  Government, or that Britain cannot dictate how she shall conduct  policy. The technique of imposing "collective punishment" on  Israel for one policy or another is pointless. Britain cannot  impose an economic embargo on another government simply because  its political considerations differ from those of His Majesty's.    The British Government has taught us another lesson at the  same time. Prime Minister John Major refused to accept the  Jewish community's invitation to take part in an evening devoted  to Jerusalem on Jerusalem Day. His secretary justified that on  the ground that Britain does not recognize and, indeed, rejects  Israel's annexation of Jerusalem. Short and sweet. This is a  community that sought to be honored by honoring the man who  serves as the prime minister and, in the end, was honored by his  disgrace. The festive dinner was held in a synagogue in  Jerusalem even without a speech by Prime Minister John Major.</p>

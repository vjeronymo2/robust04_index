			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Survey of Locating in North America (3): One big weakness - North American Free Trade Agreement EIGHT reports, prepared by the Bush Administration's 'private sector advisers,' were sent to Capitol Hill last month along with the text of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). Seven of the eight were hearty endorsements. 'Nafta is the most comprehensive agreement dealing with services that the US has yet negotiated,' said Mr John Reed, chairman of Citicorp. 'By linking the US more closely to two of our principal trading partners, new jobs will be created, new businesses formed. . .' said Mr Joseph Gorman, chairman of automotive, space and information services group TRW. Furthermore, said Mr James Robinson, chairman of American Express, the pact will 'enhance the worldwide competitiveness of US companies and provide a model and incentive for more open trade and investment relations with other countries.' The business leaders - all chairman of three of the advisory committees - had good reason for their delight. For multinationals, the Nafta comes close to total wish fulfilment. If the pact is approved by the legislatures of the US, Mexico and Canada, it will provide a legal basis for economic integration of North America over the next 15 years, nourish the marriage of cheap Mexican labour and US and Canadian technology and capital and forever change the face of business relations between the trading relations. Over the next 15 years, tariffs, quotas, and licensing requirements will disappear between the three signatories. Gradually, the countries will open to each other's companies their government procurement and telecommunications markets. Lawyers, bankers, accountants, truckers, insurers, providers of most services - and those yet to be invented - will be allowed to move and operate freely in the region. With just a few exceptions - the oil sector in Mexico and the 'cultural' sector in Canada - investors from one Nafta country will be accorded the same rights as domestic producers in another. Although some takeovers will require government approval, investors will have no performance standards to meet and they will not face any restrictions on transfers of profits, royalties or other payments, proceeds from the sale of all or part of their investments. They will have complete protection for their patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets. Although the borders of the trade area will be protected by domestic content requirements - in the case of cars, 62.5 per cent in eight years - new barriers have not been raised to outsiders. More than ever before, environmental safeguards have been included in this pact. Customs procedures are harmonised and an elaborate dispute settlement mechanism is established with a commission and a secretariat to manage the implementation of the agreement. For all its truly historic proportions, the pact has one big weakness: its failure to provide for the social consequences of integration. In its haste to help President Carlos Salinas of Mexico 'lock in' his unilateral economic reforms, the US and Canada may be condemning Mexico to economic domination by the multinationals of its northern neighbours. Their failure to push for expanded labour rights may doom Mexican workers to continued exploitation and subsistence living standards. This is where the eighth 'public sector adviser' - the Labour Advisory Committee - stands. It acknowledges that Mexico has labour laws on the books as strong or even stronger than its northern neighbours. But, to its own detriment, the laws are not enforced. 'There are no protections in this agreement against further de-industrialisation of the American economy,' the LAC says. 'There are no counter-incentives to inhibit massive transfers of investment and production to Mexico.' The pact will inevitably lead to plant closures, job losses and lower standards of living in the higher-wage nations, the LAC continues. 'For all the countries, it could mean the degradation of workplace health and safety standards, a possible increased use of child labour and a general deterioration of labour management relations.' US trade officials insist this will never happen. Trade-related jobs pay 17 per cent more than other jobs, they say; ultimately Mexican wages will rise as they have in other export-based economies. This contention is disputed, however, by a new report from the nonpartisan Congressional Office of Technology Assessment (OTA). 'Mexican wages will probably remain low, held down by large-scale unemployment and underemployment, attracting investment by US companies seeking to compete through low wages rather than high productivity,' said the OTA. Furthermore, the pact will throw Mexicans off their uncompetitive farms and businesses, which will lead to increase emigration from Mexico to the US. Growing trade and investment will intensify the environmental problems along the 2,000-mile US-Mexico border. The extent to which these trends - or, indeed, the pact as a whole - will affect the US and Canadian economies is in dispute. A special study by DRI-McGraw Hill concluded that although the agreement will change the profile of North American industry and alter investment and trade flows over the long run, the impact will not be immediate 'nor will it be static over time.' 'In general, DRI (Daewoo Research Institute) expects the major impact of the agreement to occur on investment flows, at least in the short term, while a significant stimulus to increased trade flows will occur only over a longer period of time,' it said. Although it is difficult to separate purely Nafta-related investment from other capital flows, Mexico has already experienced a huge increase in investment - a cumulative 78 per cent increase between 1988 and 1991. Mexico will absorb the largest macroeconomic impact, but the effect will be limited to about 1 per cent a year on Mexico's growth rate. The impact on the US and Canada will be even smaller. A significant factor in the outcome could be the US election. Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic candidate, has promised to strengthen Nafta provisions for labour and the environment.</p>

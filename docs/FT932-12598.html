			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Japan shows a flicker of revival THE TWO-YEAR decline in the Japanese economy may be bottoming out, according to the official index which predicts economic activity six months ahead. The official index of leading economic indicators, published yesterday, rose to 80 per cent in February. It was the second month in a row in which the index was above the 50 per cent level which marks the line between continued decline and renewed growth. However, a clutch of other statistics, including a survey revealing sharp falls in consumer confidence in the first three months of the year, suggest the economy remains in a fragile state without strong signs of recovery. The surge in the index of leading indicators was mainly due to low commodity prices, modest increases in the money supply, higher machinery orders, a sustained rise in housing starts and an improved outlooked for manufacturing industry's profits. The leading index is a gauge of economic conditions six months ahead. The coincident index which measures current economic conditions rose to 66.7 per cent in February, the first time it has stood above 50 per cent for two years. The Economic Planning Agency, which published the indices, warned it was too early to say the economy was about to recover. The surge in February came before the recent sharp appreciation of the yen, which may have damaged business confidence. It may also reflect only a temporary pick-up in business activity before the end of the last financial year on March 31. Other figures published by the EPA suggest there is little prospect the economy will recover strongly or quickly. Consumer confidence fell again in the first three months, by 1.3 per cent to 38.3 per cent. The fall was mainly due to a sharp deterioration in the employment outlook as companies cut staff. The employment outlook index fell by 14.4 per cent to 23.7 per cent. A Ministry of International Trade and Industry survey of large retailers found that retail sales last month were 7.5 per cent down in the year before, the 10th consecutive monthly decline and the largest fall since the ministry began the survey in 1971. Hotel occupancy rates in Tokyo were down 7 per cent last month on a year ago, while a survey of 100 top restaurants reported the lowest increase in sales, 2.8 per cent, since 1975. The Ministry of Labour designated a further 19 industries as eligible for labour subsidies to help them through restructuring, while they reduce workforces. About 138 industries, with about 3.67m workers, are now eligible for the subsidies, which help to cover wages while workers are laid off or undergoing retraining. Among the 19 sectors newly designated are the car and computer industries. The seriousness of the downturn was underlined by the first-ever subsidies given to the motor and computer industries to cover restructuring.</p>

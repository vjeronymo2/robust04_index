			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / International Capital Markets: Sydney to trade share futures  -Contracts on NAB, News Corp and BHP offered Individual share futures will start trading on the Sydney Futures Exchange on Monday, following a decision yesterday by Mr Michael Lavarch, Australia's attorney-general. The SFE will be the first significant futures market to trade futures contracts on individual stocks - in this case, National Australia Bank (NAB), Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, and Broken Hill Proprietary, the steel and resources group. At present, the only existing individual share futures involve a handful of Swedish stocks which are traded in London. Such contracts are specifically prohibited in the US, largely because of price manipulation concerns. But even in Australia, the SFE's move is not without controversy. Some of the companies, whose equity is involved in the new contracts, are expressing reservations about the scheme, and a local war is brewing between the SFE and the Australian Stock Exchange over who should run this type of derivatives market. Stung by the SFE's move, the ASX says it plans to announce its own equity-derivatives initiative next week - and that, unlike the SFE, it is considering a product which could be settled into scrip, not cash. This would mean an investor could acquire the underlying physical stock via the futures market, something which the SFE contract structure specifically rules out. The shares involved in the SFE contracts belong to the nation's three largest quoted companies in terms of market capitalisation, and are among the most actively traded on the physical market. The SFE claims that the new contracts will provide professional investors with a convenient, low-cost means of gaining exposure to Australia's benchmark stocks, as well as increasing trading opportunities through the leverage involved in share futures. It points out that brokerage costs will be significantly lower for the same underlying bundle of shares, and that the futures can be traded for 18 hours a day - well into US and European time-zones, when when the ASX is closed. If all goes well, the SFE adds that a range of other stocks could be introduced in the near future. However, Mr Les Hosking, SFE chief executive, suggests that liquidity considerations will probably limit the eventual number to around ten. Western Mining Corporation, whose shares tend to be influenced by metal price movements, is a favoured early possibility. But not all companies are keen on the new moves. BHP, for example, acknowledges that the cash settlement arrangements mean that the new contracts do not pose takeover-related concerns. However, the resource group points out that its own investor relations efforts are directed at attracting an informed shareholder base, and says that the future contracts 'won't do us a lot of good'. While reluctant to invoke the 'market manipulation' spectre, BHP cites two potential problems. First, there is the potential increase in the volatility of BHP shares (assuming the futures contracts are well-used) and the difficulty of explaining share price movements to management and shareholders. Second, some professional investors may prefer a leveraged play on the BHP share price via the futures market, and be less likely to support the physical stock. That said, the company acknowledges that many futures strategies will also require some ownership of the underlying stock. If companies have qualms, the ASX is even more doubtful. In the 1980s, before the country's regional exchanges were melded into one national entity, the Melbourne exchange introduced equity futures. Traded on the Australian Financial Futures Market, these also involved cash settlement, but eventually the AFFM petered out. Now the ASX's derivatives division faces the galling sight of the SFE stealing the march. In riposte, it says its competing initiative will have some significantly differences - notably in terms of clearing arrangements, and offering settlement into scrip rather than cash. 'The product we are looking at would have the potential for delivery of the underlying security,' the ASX says. Finally, there is the question of how much interest will be shown by the investment community generally in the new products. Mr Hosking says the SFE's marketing efforts have had a good reception, and claims 'strong interest' from London. BHP has found considerable diversity in its shareholders' views. Regulators, meanwhile, are watching with some scepticism - perhaps hopeful that the new contracts will not put their mettle to the test.</p>

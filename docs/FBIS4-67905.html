			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Atul Aneja, New Delhi: ``Agni Takes India's </F> Progress to the Skies'']    [Text] The successful third test of the Agni long range  missile last week has set the stage for a potential Indo-U.S.  row on nonproliferation. But with growing domestic, industrial,  and academic pressure, Washington may find it difficult to arm  twist New Delhi into scrapping its ambitious missile programme.    After the confirmation on 19 February that India is  technologically moving towards a position from where it can  deliver a nuclear device at a target about 2000 km away, the  U.S. may announce new penalties to halt India's drive to master  intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) know-how. New  American laws on high-technology exports are round the corner.    Indications from Washington suggest that the two-year ban on  the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), imposed in May  1992, may be extended. With nonproliferation high on the Clinton  Administration's agenda, Agni's successful test may only prompt  the U.S. to order further restrictions. Already, the Clinton  Administration has said that it wants to discuss with New Delhi,  the steps to ``meet our overall nonproliferation goals and the  requirements for waiving sanctions'' against ISRO.    But, the U.S. has to contend with a powerful counterview. In  the American debate on export controls, it is being argued that  the restrictive regimes have not had the desired impact on  proliferation. On the contrary, countries subjected to  restrictions have gone ahead with their programmes. Some of them  have even emerged competitors to American industry. The Council  of Competitiveness, an organisation including chief executives  of American business, university representatives and organised  labour members, in a recent report has brought these arguments  into focus. The study notes that the denial of super-computers  to India and China have been a ``significant factor'' in driving  these countries to master super-computing capabilities.    ``The Chinese manufacturer poses a threat to western  manufacturers in the Chinese market, and the Indian manufacturer  has enjoyed a modest success in the world market,'' the study  observes.    On other counts too, the curbs have made a negative impact  on  American industry. As many as 120,000 American jobs were  affected by these decisions, the study estimates. The U.S. also  lost $6,000 millions in exports.    Though the U.S. Congress is willing to look afresh at the  export controls, the State Department continues to feel that  restrictive regimes are useful tools. Nevertheless, Congress is  considering a new export control package. Some of the ideas call  for liberalising and simplifying export codes. Others aim at  tightening restrictions on dual use exports.    Despite the predominance of indigenous material in Indian  missiles, American restrictions can affect India in a few  critical areas. Indian missiles are still dependent on  sophisticated American components. Some advanced chips, which  can stand the rigours of military use, are purchased from the  U.S.    Indigenising is difficult because of Western curbs on the  supply of machinery to fabricate components of such precision.  From a commercial viewpoint, the enormous costs inhibit this. In  addition, purchases from third sources are difficult. Most  countries which possess these items are members of the  multilateral Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR).    Theoretically, India, at the moment, will have to contend  with the U.S.-led regime of western technology restrictions,  targeting Indian space and missile programmes. Restrictions  inhibiting the flow of sophisticated technology are imposed  under the MTCR.    Made up of 22 countries, the regime aims at restricting  missile development outside a predominantly western club. It  provides for punitive action against any country developing  missiles which can cause mass destruction more than 300 km.  away. Penalties are enforced, mainly by denying advanced  technology, which have both a military and civil use.    MTCR members have or are expected to frame domestic laws  restricting export of dual use knowhow. Laws have to be  supplemented by lists of such technologies. Thus, after the MTCR  charter was signed by seven developed countries in 1987, the  U.S. passed the National Defence Authorisation Act (NDAA). In  May 1992, the NDAA was invoked to impose a two-year ban on  technology sales to the Indian Space Research Organisation along  with the Russian space agency, Glavkosmos. Validation licences,  which could permit American companies to sell items to the ISRO  were put on hold for two years. It was argued that the cryogenic  engines ISRO intended to procure from Russia could enable India  to develop an Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile (ICBM). The  GSLV [Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle] rocket which  would enable India to launch satellites in the geosynchronous  orbit could also yield the strategic missile, it was felt.    Apparently, American fears were reinforced when India, for  the second time in April 1992, tested the Agni missile. The  SLV-3 rocket which was developed by the ISRO was modified to  become the first stage of the Agni.    Countering the American argument, India felt that the real  U.S. concern was not security. A Geosynchronous Satellite Launch  Vehicle would have enabled India to quickly enter the lucrative  satellite launch market, so far the domain of the West, though  China has broken into these exclusive western preserves.    Tightening the screws on India further, the U.S. Commerce  Department in 1992, made suitable amendments to target specific  space and missile related projects. Amending the Export  Administration Regulations (EAR), an interim order was passed to  lay new restrictions on a range of projects. U.S. companies were  told to obtain special validation licences destined for the Agni  and Prithvi projects of the integrated guided missile  development programme.    ISRO's SLV-3, the Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle (ASLV),  the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and the (GSLV) also  featured on this list. Since the restrictions were project  centred, all enterprises in the U.S. and India which contributed  to them were affected. As many as 78 institutions and 107 Indian  industries contribute to the ISRO's programmes.    After trying to scare India with the restrictions it can  impose, the U.S. may now make a fresh bid to force the country  to join the MTCR. But, this move is unlikely to succeed. Like  the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), which India rejects,  the MTCR is also discriminatory. Countries have joined the MTCR  either as members or adherents. Unlike the original seven  western trading partners, adherents do not participate in MTCR  meetings. Neither are they involved in moving amendments and  resolutions. It is extremely doubtful that adherents find access  to sophisticated western technology, as a reward for  acquiescence. Argentina, a MTCR adherent, had faced the  humiliation of destroying the assemblies of the Condor 2  launchers, in the presence of Western verifiers.    After Agni's launch, India will have to choose from one of  the three options: convert Agni from a test to a ``battlefield''  weapon, continue with experiments after stating an intent only  to develop and demonstrate IRBM technology, or drop the project  altogether.    One view making the rounds among defence experts here is  that  India should develop the missile, but not fit it with warheads.  Retaining the option to ``arm'' the missile can also signal that  India is driven not by belligerence, but with a desire to  enhance security. This non-provocative deployment, with the  deterrence spin-off in the neighbourhood, is also consistent  with India's global position on missile development. Destruction  of missiles is the responsibility of all, not of a select few.    The move will have a significant impact. The powerful  commercial lobby in the U.S. which says that restrictions on  large countries, such as India and China, are potentially  counterproductive, can also be armed with a new argument. This  could well open the debate among MTCR members to include India  as a missile power, and not as an adherent. There is a free  exchange of technology among key MTCR members. But the regime  enjoins on the members not to supply these items outside their  fold.    In the face of possible retaliation from the U.S. scientists  have argued that there are ways to break the restrictions  log-jam. One way to overcome dependence on items such as  military grade chips, is to buy commercial grade components,  which are available more easily. Technologically, it is feasible  to use these chips in military hardware, after screening them  suitably.</p>

			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Profits warning slices 71p off Hall share price Shares of Hall Engineering (Holdings) fell almost 30 per cent yesterday following a profits warning from the Shrewsbury-based steel products and automotive engineering group. The directors said that because of problems in the Stadco automation engineering operations and margin pressure in the general steel stockholding and steel reinforcement businesses the results for the current year were expected to be 'materially short of those for 1993'. The shares closed 71p lower at 169p Last year the group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.56m and raised its dividend for the year by 10 per cent to 9.5p. In their statement yesterday the directors said that, providing there was no further deterioration in the forecast for this year, they expected to maintain the dividend at 9.5p. They said that Stadco's automation engineering division, which designs and builds assembly line welding systems for car manufacturers, had been affected by the decision of an unidentified continental European car manufacturer to cancel one of three sections of a Pounds 21m contract. Although the customer was expected to reinstate part of this section of the contract following further negotiations, the company said the disruption to Stadco's production plan had resulted in 'an under recovery of overheads'.</p>

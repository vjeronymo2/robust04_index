			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> ICE SKATING TRAINING CENTER;  </P> <P> COUPLE BUILDING A DREAM IN MOUNTAINS  </P> <P> At first it was the fresh pine scent and glistening lake waters that attracted  Walter and Carol Probst here to build a summer home a decade ago.  </P> <P> Carol, a former professional ice skater who grew up in Compton, spent a lot of  time at the outdoor ice rink in nearby Blue Jay. Walter, a retired South Bay  businessman, joined a country club to play golf.  </P> <P> "We were supposed to be retired," Carol said.  </P> <P> Then the town ice rink closed and Carol suddenly realized that a part of her  went with it. She thought about leaving, but returning to the searing summer  heat of their permanent residence in Palm Desert wasn't that appealing.  </P> <P> So she and Walter built their own ice rink.  </P> <P> Now, seven years later, they have embarked on another ambitious project, a  second state-of-the-art rink on a ridge above Blue Jay. It will be the crown  jewel of what has become the world class Ice Castle International Training  Center.  </P> <P> The hills in and around Lake Arrowhead are full of private retreats and rural  conference centers, yet none has drawn as much attention, or grown so quickly,  as the Ice Castle.  </P> <P> As many as 64 athletes at a time train here, and there is a waiting list that  includes several international prospects.  </P> <P> Often skaters remain year-round. Said 1980 Olympic figure skating gold medalist  Robin Cousins, the Ice Castle's director of skating: "This place is so  conducive to train. It's far enough from the big city that you can get away  from it all, but it's close enough to keep in contact."  </P> <P> How the Probsts wandered "up the hill" and built one of the world's newest  training facilities in a sleepy little mountain hamlet 95 mile east of Los  Angeles is a story in itself.  </P> <P> "It's been kind of a challenge," Walter said, standing dwarfed by pine trees  reaching skyward near the center's 10-acre lodge. He was less than a mile as  the crow flies from the original Ice Castle, the first rink they opened in Blue  Jay in 1983.  </P> <P> The Probsts built the first rink in a new development on the east side of Blue  Jay. In combination with an adjacent shopping center and movie theaters, in  which the Probsts are not involved, the additions nearly doubled the size of  the town's tiny business strip, which straddles State Highway 173 in a secluded  valley on the southwest tip of Lake Arrowhead.  </P> <P> Some of the funding for the training center is provided by the Foundation for  International Ice Skating Advancement, but the majority of its near  million-dollar annual price tag is footed by the Probsts. They have yet to turn  a profit but say they are committed to keeping the facility open.  </P> <P> "We just gulp and reach a little deeper," Carol said. "This is something our  government should be doing to help athletes."  </P> <P> The Probsts also wanted to provide recreation for local youths. Parks and  sporting fields are rare here. Local kids can be seen hanging out at "in" spots  such as an arcade in Lake Arrowhead Village. However, last year more than 300  local youngsters signed up for skating sessions.  </P> <P> "We are the local parks and recreation now," Carol said.  </P> <P> Carol's interest in figure skating pushed the training center concept. The two  rinks are considered state-of-the-art and include two of the world's first  360-degree jump harnesses.  </P> <P> Cousins brought an international flavor to the center three years ago. He  performed in a benefit fund-raiser in Blue Jay, liked the area and stayed on.  </P> <P> Growth continued with the addition of a youth ice hockey program. The Probsts  do not have a hand in running it, but its success almost from its inception has  made it the talk of Southern California ice hockey circles. A hockey program  for women will begin this fall.  </P> <P> The skating staff also grew to 40 full-time employees. Today the center boasts  some of the world's most skilled instructors, including Senior Ice Castle Vice  President Frank Carroll, a medal winner in three U.S. national competitions,  and coach to Linda Fratianne.  </P> <P> The Probsts picked up the nearby 10-acre lodge on a foreclosure sale. They  refurbished and reopened it as the Ice Castle Conference and Training Center.  Dormitory rooms for skaters are located here, as are a swimming pool, dining  hall, outdoor amphitheater, gymnasium and other recreational facilities.  </P> <P> "We really lucked out," Carol said. "We could not have afforded to build a  place like this."  </P> <P> Earlier this year they broke ground on their second ice rink, a million-dollar  enclosed training facility that will not open to the public.  </P> <P> Skaters range in age from 8 to 24. Since training takes about six hours each  day, attending the public mountain schools is difficult, so the Probsts plan to  open a private school on site soon.  </P> <P> "We have found that some of the best skaters are also some of the best  students," Carol said. "This is such a nice facility, away from all the things  that get kids into trouble, and we want to keep them here."  </P> <P> Skaters pay $25 a day to live here. Instructor fees are extra.  </P> <P> Six skaters have qualified for national figure-skating competition and Carol  says that several foreign athletes training here give the center "at least 12  skaters who could very easily qualify" for Olympic competition.  </P> <P> Wearing a black jump suit and sipping coffee, Carol sat rinkside as dozens of  youngsters went through workouts at the Ice Castle recently.  </P> <P> "I could sit here all day," she said, glancing at the skaters. "Trouble is, I  wouldn't get any work done."  </P> <P> As Carroll and Cousins put the skaters through stroking drills, Carol smiled.  </P> <P> "Winning championships is not our main goal," she said.  </P> <P> Carol turned pro at 18. She said she learned early in her youth that training  for Olympic competition was not for her.  </P> <P> "I would get nervous. I was not competitive material."  </P> <P> Instead, she turned to figure skating after graduating from Compton High School  in 1952. Her career spanned a decade with the Ice Follies.  </P> <P> "We want to teach these kids how to meet their own goals, whatever they are,  not to just meet our goals," Carol said.  </P> <P> Walter views the center a bit differently with a hint of red, white and blue.  </P> <P> "I love to see the kids develop. I want to get them off to a good start.  Anything I can do so our U.S. athletes can compete successfully . . . . Some of  these kids are going to make it."  </P> <P> Cousins said he came to work in Blue Jay because of the mountain community, its  good training altitude of about 5,100 feet and the facility's ambiance.  </P> <P> "The place itself is so beautiful compared to other places that I have seen  skaters train in," he said.  </P> <P> The Probsts joke about the center's lack of profit. "If we do (turn a profit)  we'll throw a big party," said Walter.  </P> <P> To make ends meet, the Probsts rent the training center for weekend business  retreats, weddings and receptions. Carol displayed a honeymoon cottage for a  visitor, which she decorated in country French. Quaint, it rents for about $100  a day, including meals and use of all center facilities. The Probsts hope to  attract more clients from metropolitan areas by including ski packages with  local resorts this winter.  </P> <P> "There are 10 million people within 50 miles of this place," Walter said. "The  population up here just is not enough to support a place like this."  </P> <P> As the center grew, the additional workload was taxing. The Probsts went  through a half dozen supervisors in the Ice Castle's first few seasons.  </P> <P> "I don't think you can find anyone who has (managed a facility) like this  before because there isn't one like it," said center manager Dennis Senior, who  has been with the Ice Castle for about a year. He previously worked in a major  hotel chain.  </P> <P> Ice time, a precious commodity in Southern California, can be maximized for  additional revenue, Walter said. He expects the rink in Blue Jay to operate all  but four hours a day, seven days a week.  </P> <P> Seated later in an office at the training center, Walter and Carol spoke of the  personal time they may have had had they not got involved with skating here.  Walter would be playing golf on exclusive desert courses and Carol would  travel.  </P> <P> From May to October, however, they spend just about every day at the rink or  the center.  </P> <P> "We'll go home (to the desert) in October," Carol said.  </P> <P> Walter chuckled. "But you'll drive up here at least once a week."  </P> <P> Said Carol: "It's always something."  </P></p>

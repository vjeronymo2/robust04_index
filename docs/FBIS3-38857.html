Wednesday's meeting is expected to include discussion of the  results of a NATO meeting in Brussels, also slated for  Wednesday, on air strikes against Serbs around Sarajevo, peace  conference spokesman John Mills said.    Mills said the talks between the foreign ministers of the  eight states concerned would take the form of an "informal  meeting." The ministers were invited by international peace  mediators Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg.    Greece earlier said it would attend the meeting, despite  original opposition to Turkey attending. Italian sources said  Rome expected an "exchange of views" on progress towards a peace  accord.    The participants -- Albania, Austria, Bulgaria, Greece,  Hungary, Italy, Romania, and Turkey -- would also consider the  impact the continuing UN embargo on the rump Yugoslavia is  having on their own economies.    Earlier in the day the Turkish Foreign Ministry in Ankara  said that the meeting might be put back. A Foreign Ministry  spokesman said "Nothing has been fixed yet."    Turkey had been invited to the meeting called by  international peace negotiators Lord Owen and Thorvald  Stoltenberg before last Saturday's massacre in Sarajevo of 68  civilians in a mortar blast which also injured 200 people.    Meanwhile Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic is due  Thursday to meet his Bosnian Serb counterpart Radovan Karadzic  and Bosnian Croats representative Mile Akmadzic, replacing Mate  Boban, who resigned Tuesday.    Representatives from neither Belgrade nor Zagreb would  attend  the talks, which aim to build "confidence-building measures"  between the three warring factions and "are not a resumption of  peace talks per se," Mill said.    One such measure would be the establishment of telephone  hotlines between the warring parties to permit rapid contact  between them, as well as the restoration of electricity to  Sarajevo.    "Those measures could assist in reducing the tension", Mills  said. But "we are under no illusion. They won't stop the  fighting." Mills added that the question of the  demilitarisation of Sarajevo would be high on the agenda  although this was was "a very complicated matter."    A Bosnian Serb statement Monday said the situation was not  condusive to a global peace settlement, but added: "the Bosnian  Serbs are now ready to bring peace to Sarajevo, to negotiate its  demilitarisation and to place it under United Nations control"  for two years, "prior to a definitive peace accord."    According to UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi, the Moslems  wanted not just the withdrawal of Serb artillery outside  Sarajevo's range, but were demanding their guns be placed under  UN control, which the Serbs would not accept.    Silajdzic has also been meeting Croatian Foreign Minister  Mate Granic in an attempt to boost relations between the two  sides, locked in bitter fighting in central Bosnia.</p>

			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / IMF/World Bank in Madrid: Lesson in north-south row - Ties between G7 Some good may yet emerge from this week's failure of members of the International Monetary Fund to agree an increase in world monetary reserves. The stand-off in the talks on a proposed allocation of the IMF's own reserve asset - known as special drawing rights - exposed such a gulf between the big industrialised nations and the developing world that policy makers have begun considering improving methods of communication and co-operation between the two sides. Immediately after the meeting, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, complained that decision-making processes of the IMF's policy-making interim committee could be improved. Since the acrimonious break up of the talks, officials from the Group of Seven leading industrial countries have been pondering how the two sides in such a long arranged meeting could go into negotiations without a proper understanding of the strength of the other side's position. Part of the problem, according to one senior G7 official, is that the level of official communications between the industrialised nations and the so-called developing countries no longer reflects the growing importance of many nations in Asia and Latin America. G7 monetary officials have had 20 years of increasingly intensive collaboration among themselves. The preparations for the annual economic summits, the regular meetings of G7 finance ministers, as well as frequent meetings in committees run by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (and in the case of the European G7 countries in the European Union), have created a nexus of contacts. Seniors officials in the G7 finance ministries and central banks talk by telephone practically every day. There are ties between G7 and developing nations but they are far less intense. Partly for this reason, officials believe, the developing nations were too willing to believe that Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director, could deliver a general allocation of SDRs on Sunday and so rejected the G7 offer of a smaller, one-off selected increase. One problem is working out suitable forums for greater co-operation. There have been suggestions that the deputy finance ministers of the countries represented on the interim committee should confer ahead of its meetings to help resolve issues. The G7 deputies meet frequently in this way and their co-operation is said to be one of the main reasons for the relatively smooth running of the group. However, the interim committee is a much bigger group with 24 members, prompting fears that meetings of interim committee deputies would be unwieldy and unproductive. Such ideas were starting to circulate among officials even before Sunday's debacle showed how the G7 cannot dictate to the developing world. Officials say the industrial countries need to respond to the growing economic importance of the developing countries. They are growing rapidly: the IMF has forecast that as a group they will expand at twice the rate of the industrial countries this year and next. They are becoming increasingly integrated in the world economy. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade predicted this week that the developing nations would boost their trade far more as a result of the Uruguay Round liberalisation measures than the OECD countries. Many developing countries, such as China, Mexico and Argentina are regional powers. Following Sunday's events, there are also strong damage-control grounds for promoting closer links. The developing nations have shown a remarkable willingness to apply the lessons of market-driven economics over the past decade. Many now appear to be more enthusiastic free-traders than big industrialised nations. The ideological differences that used to divide north and south have largely disappeared. An important reason for officials from the G7 and other industrialised nations to strengthen their ties with developing countries would be to head off any revival of the north-south divisions of the 1960s and 1970s.</p>

			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / BAe's Eustace appointed to Philips board MR Dudley Eustace, who leaves his post as finance director of British Aerospace at the end of the month, will become executive vice-president for finance and member of the board of Philips, the Dutch electronics group. The appointment of Mr Eustace, a Briton, underlines the willingness of Mr Jan Timmer, Philips president, to take steps to take the group back to greater competitiveness. Although Philips has been looking outside the Netherlands for senior staff, 'we have not seen it before on the board', the group said. Mr Eustace, 55, is resigning from BAe after shareholders criticised management for leaving them unprepared for the collapse in its profits last year. A BAe rights issue flopped last autumn. Mr Eustace initially joins the Dutch group as a member of its Group Management Committee on June 1. He becomes executive vice-president for finance from January 1, 1993, succeeding Mr Hank HA Appelo who retires at the end of the year. The move appears to be in line with Mr Timmer's Operation Centurion, an ambitious programme to cut costs, raise profitability and introduce greater dynamism and market responsiveness into a traditionally bureaucratic corporate culture. It represents moves within Philips to bring a greater international dimension to the group, which has been suffering from difficult trading in its core consumer electronics markets. 'He was the right man in the right place,' said a Philips spokesman. Mr Eustace will become the second non-Dutch member of the four-man board. Dr Frank Carruba, an American, joins the board as executive vice-president of technology. Mr Eustace is a chartered accountant and has been finance director of British Aerospace since 1988. Philips reported a pre-tax profit of Fl 1.2bn (Pounds 373.3m) in 1991, compared with a loss of Fl 4.24bn but said 'there is still a long way to go'. It has a high level of debt and recently offered to buy shares it does not already own in Super Club, a loss-making video rental business. Observer, Page 21</p>

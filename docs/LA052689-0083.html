			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH-TECH TRAFFIC SYSTEM EXPANDING  </P> <P> Ground-breaking ceremonies Thursday set the stage for a Westside addition to a  high-tech system that controls the flow of traffic through pavement sensors.  </P> <P> The automated traffic system was one of a battery of traffic control measures  used during the 1984 Olympics and is still in place in the Coliseum area.  </P> <P> The system has also been installed downtown and in the West San Fernando  Valley, and a citywide system should be in place within the next 10 years, city  Transportation Department Manager Ed Rowe said.  </P> <P> The system works through a series of pavement sensors that transmit information  about traffic conditions to a control center in City Hall. Computers  automatically modify the timing of signals to help traffic flow. The sensors  also transmit information about traffic problems so officers or emergency  response units can be quickly dispatched.  </P></p>

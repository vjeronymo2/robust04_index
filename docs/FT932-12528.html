			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Maxwell trustees seek claimants THE TRUSTEES to the Maxwell pension funds have still not traced 10 per cent of the pensioners who may be entitled to payments, the Commons social security committee was told yesterday. But they have so far spent more than Pounds 4m in professional and legal fees relating to the administration and litigation involving the pension funds. The details emerged during questioning from MPs, as former Maxwell employees demonstrated outside Parliament to highlight concerns about the diminishing amount of money available to pay their pensions. Mr Jeremy Corbyn MP said it was 'astonishing' that so many potential pensioners had not been traced, while pointing out that 'a great deal of money has been paid out in fees to all the trustees'. The trustees to the schemes said they had attempted to trace other pensioners through a Department of Social Security service, but blamed their difficulties on poor administration of the schemes while they were controlled by the late Robert Maxwell. Clay &amp; Partners, trustees to the private Maxwell companies, said it had spent Pounds 1.3m in legal and professional fees by the end of last year. MGN Pension Trustees, responsible for the Mirror Group pensioners, had spent Pounds 1.7m on legal costs by January 15 this year. Law Debenture Trust, trustees to the Maxwell Communication Pension Plan, had spent Pounds 923,000 by the end of December. All these figures excluded value added tax. The trustees also expressed concerns that more than Pounds 75m in insurance cover against fraud could be in jeopardy. They said the insurers were claiming the policies were void because they had not been notified that alleged frauds were already taking place. At the Maxwell pensioners' rally Mr Ken Trench, chairman of the Maxwell Pensioners' Action Group, criticised the government for its short-term approach, which he said was using emergency funding to pay current pensions and took no account of future hardship payments. Mr Frank Field, the Labour MP for Birkenhead who chairs the social security committee, told the pensioners rally that he believed there was 'light at the end of the tunnel'. He said the trustees now showed 'guarded optimism' that within a five-year period money would come in from various sources 'to pay the vast majority' of pensioners and those still to retire their due.</p>

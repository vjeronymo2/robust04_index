			<p><P> December 31, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOWL UPDATE;  </P> <P> SUGAR;  </P> <P> HIS VIRGINIA FRIENDS HAVE LAST LAUGH  </P> <P> In addition to the approximately 10,000 fans Virginia has brought to New  Orleans for the Sugar Bowl, some followers of the Cavaliers already live here.  </P> <P> One of those is Virginia graduate Hill Riddle, the rector of Trinity Episcopal  Church in New Orleans.  </P> <P> Riddle said some friends from his native Old Dominion have kidded him about his  new home.  </P> <P> "I would tell them, 'I'm going to live in New Orleans until Virginia plays in  the Sugar Bowl.' And then I would roll with laughter because I knew that would  never happen.  </P> <P> "Well, I guess I've got to find another excuse to stay here now."  </P> <P> Virginia defensive back Jason Wallace is a graduate of Bethel High School in  Hampton, Va., as is Tennessee's Todd Kelly, a sophomore defensive end for the  Volunteers.  </P> <P> Wallace, a senior who also returns punts for the Cavaliers, said he and Kelly  spoke extensively while they were home for Christmas.  </P> <P> "We wished each other our best game ever," Wallace said. "No matter the  outcome, we hope the other does well."  </P> <P> Tennessee cornerbacks Jeremy Lincoln and J.J. McCleskey become the latest  defenders to try to contain Herman Moore, Virginia's 6-foot-5 All-American wide  receiver and three-time ACC high-jump champion. "He's a concern to us, as he  probably has been to every secondary they've played this year," Lincoln said.  "He's tall, rangy and can jump. I may need a stepladder. I'm just 5-11 and  J.J.'s not real tall either. Maybe we can put J.J. on my back and together we  can play one corner to cover him."  </P></p>

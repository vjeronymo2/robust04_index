			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / UK Company News: Pounds 21m Swedish purchase for Siebe Siebe, the international controls and engineering group, is to become Europe's leading control valve producer following its acquisition for Pounds 21m of Sweden's NAF Group. Mr Allen Yurko, Siebe's chief executive, described the acquisition as a 'perfect fit' from a geographical, product, and market sector point of view. NAF makes industrial control valves, actuators and positioners, and is particularly strong in the pulp and paper industry, where Siebe has limited exposure. It also sells to the energy sector. The company is debt free and has been consistently profitable. It has a 25 per cent market share in the Nordic countries, where Siebe has yet to develop a presence. About 80 per cent of NAF's sales are in Scandinavia, and Mr Yurko said: 'One of the key strategies here is to add the full range of Foxboro Eckardt products into the Scandinavian market.' Siebe invested some Pounds 110m last year in expanding its controls division through the acquisition of three new companies, Eckardt, Eberle and Schmidt. Analysts expect similar bolt-on acquisitions to follow, as Siebe broadens its range of products and markets.</p>

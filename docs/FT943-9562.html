			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / International Company News: TCI acquires smaller US rival Tele-Communications, the largest cable television operator in the US, is to acquire TeleCable, a smaller, privately held rival. In total, the deal values the Virginia-based TeleCable, which is believed to generate annual revenues of about Dollars 300m, at Dollars 1.4bn. The acquisition, to be equity-financed, will boost TCI's dominant share of the US cable television market to more than 18 per cent. Under the terms of the agreement, TeleCable shareholders will get 41.7m shares of TCI's class A common stock, plus Dollars 300m of a convertible preferred stock paying a 5.5 per cent dividend. For its money, TCI will get 740,000 new subscribers and 21 cable systems spread across 15 states, with the largest concentration in the Dallas area. The deal will take the number of TCI's subscribers to just under 11m, out of a total 60m homes in the US with cable television. The acquisition of TeleCable by TCI is the most recent example of the consolidation of the US cable television industry, which is becoming increasingly dominated by a handful of large nationwide operators.</p>

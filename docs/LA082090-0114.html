			<p><P> August 20, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NO TAKERS, E. GERMAN SELLER OF DISTRESSED BUSINESSES QUITS  </P> <P> The man in charge of selling East Germany's troubled factories and businesses  resigned today after finding too few investors willing to buy them.  </P> <P> The resignation of Reiner Gohlke became public just hours after Foreign  Minister Markus Meckel also resigned.  </P> <P> Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere said he will not replace Meckel but will  himself assume the duties of the nation's senior diplomat.  </P> <P> Meckel stepped down after his party, the Social Democrats, voted Sunday to  leave De Maiziere's foundering governing coalition. He was the fifth minister  to leave the government in a week.  </P> <P> The huge fissures in the nation's first freely elected government plunged it  deeper into a crisis fueled by economic problems and ferocious battles among  parties seeking to win elections for a united German government.  </P> <P> The political infighting has increasingly appalled a populace preoccupied with  rising food and fuel prices and skyrocketing joblessness.  </P> <P> "I don't even know what both parties want," said Thomas Wollenburg as he and  his wife, Andrea, pushed their two young children in strollers to an  unemployment office in East Berlin.  </P> <P> Wollenburg said he was among 50 workers laid off from his construction firm two  weeks ago.  </P> <P> Both the conservative Christian Democrats of De Maiziere and of West German  Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and the left-leaning Social Democrats in both German  states, accuse each other of using East Germany's economic problems for  political gain.  </P> <P> The Social Democrats voted to leave the coalition Sunday after De Maiziere  fired four Cabinet members last week, including the agriculture, finance and  economics ministers. The party contended that De Maiziere unilaterally fired  the ministers to protect his own party's political fortunes in the face of the  economic problems.  </P></p>

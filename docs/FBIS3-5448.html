			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kiatchai Phongphanit: "Burma-ASEAN, An </F> Expensive Investment"]    [Text] It is rather apparent that Thailand is very eager  to invite Burma to the ASEAN ministerial meeting it will host in  Bangkok in July. One can recall that Squadron Leader Prasong  Sunsiri has tried to bring Burma to the ASEAN meeting as an  observer. Thailand has openly made known its position on this  matter.    No one knows whether the invitation, which is common  knowledge, to Burma was in exchange for something from that  country. However, the foreign minister's visit to Burma was  followed by an increase in trade contracts between the two  countries. More important, several hundred Thai fishermen were  released by Burma.    In any event, the foreign minister has not relaxed his  drive.  He has tried to lobby fellow ASEAN countries to see the merit  of inviting Burma to the ASEAN meeting with full observer  status. He said during a recent official visit to Manila that  he saw no complications in inviting Burma for consultations with  ASEAN. The Thai foreign minister's stand is clear.    It is difficult to understand the eagerness on the part of  Thailand when other ASEAN countries do not seem to be concerned  if Burma avoids involvement in ASEAN at this time. Singapore  did not invite Burma as an observer to the ASEAN ministerial  meeting it hosted last year. A result of Singapore's skillful  diplomacy is that it was able to avoid negative comments from  the countries which were applying pressure against Burma.    Vietnam attended the Singapore meeting last year as an  observer, signifying a degree of acceptance of that country by  ASEAN. However, during his recent visit to Vietnam Singapore  Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said that country should not  consider joining ASEAN for another year or two.    Thailand's diplomatic skills trail those of Singapore. At  this point we should make known our position that the time is  now right for Vietnam to join ASEAN. The Vietnamese  administrative system can hardly be an obstruction. The Burmese  system is just as lamentable; how can Thailand justify its  endeavor in favor of Burma? Thailand cannot avoid strong  criticism on this matter. The long-term repercussion will be  considerable because we will be on the opposite side of the  superpowers who are applying pressure against Burma.    We cannot even correctly choose sides; what else is there to  say about this bungling?    A point to be concerned with is losing face if Thailand's  eagerness does not receive the expected response. So far we  have not heard about the Burmese position regarding how eager it  is to accept an ASEAN invitation.    It is likely that this year Burma will be occupied with its  domestic problems more so than it might be with ASEAN matters  because it knows that its acceptance will not be easy. Burma  has seen the Vietnam case as an example, and it will be forced  to think even harder.    Burma will be pressured by many events. One will be the fact  that the ASEAN ministerial meeting will be held in July, the  same month that Aung San Suu Kyi's detention is scheduled to  end. There are rumors that Suu Kyi's detention will be  extended. A refusal to release her will essentially disqualify  Burma from joining the international community. Pressure from  the United States, the UK, and the European Union will increase,  and an ASEAN action concerning Burma could lead to a future  confrontation with those countries. Thailand will not be able  avoid their dissatisfaction because it led the campaign to  invite Burma.    There is an ambitious anticipation that because the group in  power allowed a U.S. congressman to meet Suu Kyi, a settlement  between her and the Burmese Government is possible. THE  ECONOMIST even ridiculed Congressman Richardson's grandeur about  a meeting between Suu Kyi and Khin Nyunt "even if they only  discuss the weather."    Another problem facing Burma is peace talks with minority  groups. These talks will never reach concrete agreements as in  the accord with the Kachins. On this subject, Thailand was  accused of forcing minority groups to negotiate and accept  conditions set by the military dictatorship in Rangoon.    Burma will be forced to exert efforts to achieve concrete  achievements in these areas. To join ASEAN merely to show that  it has become part of the international community will not help  Burma solve the minority problem.    The drafting of the Constitution by the Rangoon power  holders  is a joke, not only because there are conditions that retain the  military leadership role, but the Burmese military dictatorship  has already started to arrest people who oppose the drafting and  the conditions. The constitution will fuel new, violent  political confrontation, and chaos will be unending.    What qualifications does Burma have for Thailand to invite  its participation in ASEAN? By offering an invitation, Thailand  will be viewed as engaging in trade and association with that  country only to exploit it for short-term and unethical reasons.    It is anticipated that as the ASEAN meeting in Bangkok in  July approaches, U.S. pressure against Burma will increase. The  U.S. policy toward Burma will be more aggressive in conjunction  with pressure from U.S. allies such as the UK, France,  Australia, the Scandinavian countries, the European Union,  Japan, and the United Nations.    The main demands of the group applying pressure against  Burma  are the unconditional release of Suu Kyi and the return of  legitimate power to the group which won the general election in  1990, improved human rights, and the formation of a democratic  government acceptable to the world community.    Burma has apparently done nothing in these areas. In the  eyes of the world, the so-called "constructive engagement" has  not done anything constructive for Burma, only constructive  business dealings. One cannot understand why there is such  eagerness to invite Burma to the upcoming ASEAN meeting. Will  this investment turn out to be too expensive? Where can  Thailand hide its face if Burma feels that it should tackle its  problems first and reject the invitation?</p>

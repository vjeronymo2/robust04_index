			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Annual-hours contracts spread rapidly THE USE OF contracts fixing the number of hours worked each year rather than each week is increasing rapidly, particularly in the service sector, a survey by the Institute of Personnel Management shows. 'Annualised hours' contracts allow companies to cope with varying demand and cut overtime costs. The survey, due to be published in full next month, found that of more than 80 organisations operating annualised hours schemes, 60 per cent had introduced them since 1989. In the service sector, more than 65 per cent of the companies surveyed had brought them in since 1991. Nearly all the organisations using annualised hours were extremely satisfied, the IPM said. The majority also considered that employees liked it, although some workers complained about 'reserve hours' in some schemes, which meant that they could be called in to work at very short notice to cover absence or unexpected demand. Cardiff-based Matsushita Electric, making televisions and microwave ovens, reported in the survey that it had saved about Pounds 3m since introducing annualised hours for about 1,500 production workers in January last year. The company has been able to organise working hours around seasonal variations in demand - 60 per cent to 65 per cent of demand for its products comes between September and December. Some companies, however, including Bristol and West Building Society and ITN, reported that the recession was making it difficult to decide on the right number of hours one year ahead. The institute reported that there was increasing evidence of annualised hours contracts being introduced to retain valued staff, as well as for the more traditional reasons of meeting demand and cutting overtime payments. Some women returning to work after having children asked for annualised hours so they could work more flexibly, it said.</p>

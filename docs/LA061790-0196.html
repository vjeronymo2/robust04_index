			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISGRUNTLED HOLLYWOOD MERCHANTS FORM ORGANIZATION  </P> <P> Hollywood merchants have formed their own business watch organization, in part  to counter efforts by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce to start a management  program headed by a former deputy to City Councilman Michael Woo.  </P> <P> At its first meeting recently, the Hollywood Boulevard District Improvement  Assn. voted unanimously to oppose the chamber's efforts to organize merchants  through a contract it awarded to former Woo aide Nina Greenberg.  </P> <P> The chamber awarded the $56,000 contract to Greenberg without competitive  bidding and with little notice or publicity. Besides organizing area  businesses, Greenberg's job description includes organizing merchants to form  an assessment district in which merchants would be charged for improved city  services.  </P> <P> The idea of such an assessment district outraged many local merchants at the  meeting, who said they already pay for services through an existing Hollywood  Boulevard District.  </P> <P> The association issued a statement condemning the contract and the  chamber-sponsored business watch group. It read, in part, that: "The gross  neglect and deterioration of the (existing) Hollywood Boulevard District over  so many years is so outrageously scandalous and economically threatening that  immediate attention and cooperation is demanded from City Councilman (Woo's)  office, the Community Redevelopment Agency of Los Angeles and the Hollywood  Chamber of Commerce to address and act upon these issues."  </P> <P> The grass-roots improvement association, which claims dozens of members, met  again Thursday night to determine specific program objectives. The group said  it wants to improve an area from La Brea Avenue to Gower Street, and from Yucca  Street to Selma Avenue, encompassing the Hollywood Walk of Fame.  </P> <P> Several of the organizers are members of the Project Area Committee, an elected  citizens panel that Woo replaced as the advisory body to the city Community  Redevelopment Agency's $922-million Hollywood redevelopment project.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the group appointed as the new CRA advisory body, the Hollywood  Community Advisory Council, has changed the meeting times of its executive  committee to increase community input. The meetings have been moved to the  second Monday of each month at 6:30 p.m. at the Hollywood Senior Multi-Purpose  Center, 6501 Fountain Ave.  </P></p>

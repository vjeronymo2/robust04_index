			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo -- On 31 March, the Ministry of Posts and  Telecommunications [MOPT] called on the Frequency Control  Council (chairman: Masaki Ikuta) for advice, asking whether a  preliminary license for operating a television station should be  granted to Ryukyu Asahi Broadcasting Corporation (which is being  formed by Takashi Higa, representative organizer and adviser to  OKINAWA TIMES). The council positively responded to the inquiry  the same day. The preliminary license is a de facto approval to  begin service. Because of this, full-fledged activities,  including establishment of the company itself and construction  of the station building, will take place for the establishment  of the third private television station in Okinawa. It is  expected that the station will start its service in October  1995. Since Ryukyu Asahi plans to establish cooperative ties  with the Ryukyu Broadcasting Corporation (RBC), which is an  exisiting operational station, attention is focused on the  possibility that two channels will be given to one company. As  for granting a preliminary license to Southwest Broadcasting  Corporation (representative organizer: Hidenobu Goya, chairman  of the Kanehide Group), the MOPT did not ask the council for  advice this time.    Following the MOPT's decision in July last year to allocate  two additional channels to Okinawa, Ryukyu Asahi Broadcasting  Corporation, which is affiliated with Television Asahi, and the  Southwest Broadcasting Corporation, which is scheduled to  receive television programs from Nippon Television Network  Corporation, applied for a preliminary license. Of the two, the  application of Ryukyu Asahi was approved and the Frequency  Control Council, which is an advisory organization to the MOPT,  advised the ministry to grant a preliminary license. According  to the preliminary license, Ryukyu Asahi's call name is QAB and  will use channel 28. Its transmitting station and main station  will be constructed in Kakazu, Tomishiro-son, and Kumoji, Naha,  respectively. Construction of the stations will be completed on  6 October 1995.    Moreover, the total amount of its capital is 700 million  yen.  Its investors are Asahi National Broadcasting Co., ASAHI  SHIMBUN, RBC and 10 local companies. Takashi Higa,  representative organizer, is scheduled to become president of  the new station.    Ryukyu Asahi will use seven relay stations to transmit its  programs. Because of this, 87.2 percent of all households --  almost the entire area of Okinawa -- will be covered. Miyako  and Yaeyama [islands] will not be included in the coverage area  for the time being.    The preliminary license will be issued on 6 April. Ryukyu  Asahi plans to establish a company in May. After that, Ryukyu  Asahi will start to construct its office building, order  equipment, and compile programs to prepare for its grand  opening. According to a plan, Ryukyu Asahi will have its office  in the building of RBC, which will also dispatch its capable  members to Ryukyu Asahi.    As for Southwest Broadcasting Corporation, the MOPT decided  not to query the council this time regarding issuance of a  preliminary license, saying: "We are still screening its  application." The Nippon Television Network Corporation  explains: "It is difficult to take action because the situation  regarding the television business is still severe. No progress  has been made at the site."</p>

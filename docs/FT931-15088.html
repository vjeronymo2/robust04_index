			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: London Fox considers changes to sugar market THE LONDON sugar futures market committee yesterday considered a consultants' report on developing the London markets, including one suggestion that the raws contract should change from dollars to sterling, reports Reuter. 'Those in favour of having a sterling raw sugar market are growing in number. But it will have to be considered further and it is much too early to take a decision at the moment,' said Mr Michael Overlander, the committee's chairman. The report, by Landell Mills Commodities Studies, was commissioned by the London Futures and Options Exchange (Fox) in June last year. The intention was to discuss ways in which the markets could adapt to changing world market conditions. Traders have been concerned in particular by the recent decline in volumes on the raw sugar market. In a previous attempt to revive interest, the market switched from floor trading to Fox's screen-trading system FAST, only to revert to the floor a year later, in January 1992. Changing to sterling from dollars would open the way for arbitrage trading with the New York market, dealers said. It has also been suggested that the exchange should rejuvenate the existing white sugar options contract. The committee will now consult with other market users on the findings of Landell Mills' report. 'We will expect to have completed this by early March,' said Mr Robin Woodhead, Fox's chief executive.</p>

			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Working Life: Headaches, a pill popper's guide - Health What is the difference between Doan's Backache Pills and Nurse Sykes' Powders? At first sight, everything. Mr Doan brings you khaki brown tablets to deal with 'sprains, lumbago and fibrositis'. Nurse Sykes offers a white powder with a faint vinegary odour suitable for treating 'influenza, feverishness and feverish colds'. But the ingredients are almost identical, essentially paracetamol and aspirin. The only real difference is Nurse Sykes is more stimulating: she administers half a mug of coffee's worth of caffeine with her painkillers. Both medications are available in UK pharmacies, along with another 70-plus branded headache treatments. Hundreds more fill drug store shelves in other countries. The fuzzy-headed can simplify the buying decision by staying loyal to one brand. Alternatively they can read the side of the pack to find out which of the four or five possible active ingredients is used. The intelligent pill popper looks out for: Aspirin which, after almost a century of commercialisation, is still the number one choice for many. There are three related compounds in the aspirin family. Acetylsalicylic acid, the official aspirin, salicylic acid and sodium salicylate. Each works in the same way, but acetylsalicylic acid is often preferred by drugs manufacturers because there may be a slightly lower chance of irritating the stomach. Paracetamol, called acetominophen or branded Tylenol in the US, is as effective as aspirin but without the tendency to irritate the stomach. Ibuprofen is a more powerful drug that began to be available over-the-counter (OTC) in the early 1980s and can be used to relieve menstrual and post-operative pain. Its newness means that it is not available in Greece, Portugal or Norway and a handful of other countries. Codeine and dihydrocodeine are stronger still. These powerful drugs are mildly addictive and so not available OTC without a prescription in a pure form. Even in mixtures with aspirin or paracetamol they are only available OTC in a some countries such as the UK, France, Denmark and Canada. They were once used in cough medicines in the US, 'but people used to drink it all at once', says one drugs industry executive. Naproxen. A new name , available from this month in the US, is Aleve, a tablet containing naproxen which was one of the world's biggest selling rheumatism treatments until its patent expired last year. The manufacturers say the price per dose is 'comparable' to existing analgesics and the effect lasts for eight to 12 hours. Other ingredients, such as caffeine, do not ease pain. More headache products are likely to come on to the OTC market in the next few years as governments try to shift some of the costs of healthcare to the consumer. This is likely lead to a further proliferation of brand names. The clear-headed will stick to reading the list of ingredients.</p>

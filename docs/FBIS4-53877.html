			<p>BFN     [Text] There was a report in the Japanese press that Japan  imported a total of 50,000 tons of rice from Australia in 1993  and is expected to import more than 200,000 tons in 1994. This  prompted speculation that Japan might review its rice importing  policy and probably would import only the short and medium  grains from the United States and Australia under the new  regulations of GATT. It is also anticipated that Japan will  reduce imports of long-grain rice from Thailand in keeping with  the GATT regulations.    Concerning the said report, the Thai commercial counsellor  in  Tokyo checked with Japanese rice traders and trading  associations. From their explanations, it was learned that the  report was unfounded. Japanese officials explained that the  Japanese Government had completed negotiations for rice  purchases in April and is committed to importing 760,000 tons of  rice from Thailand. They confirmed that there would be no change  in this policy.    Japanese officials explained that, under the new GATT  regulation, which will take effect in 1995, fixing minimum  access at 4 to 8 percent of local rice concumption, there was a  fear that the volume of rice imports would be smaller than at  present. Anyway, there has been no announcement about the  reduction of the amount of imports from any particular country.  Currently, Thai rice exported to Japan is used as food, for  production of sweets, and in food processing factories. It is  even believed that there would be a greater demand for Thai rice  in Japan because Thai rice is cheaper than rice imported from  other countries.</p>

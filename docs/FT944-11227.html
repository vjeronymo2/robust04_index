			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of Birmingham and the West Midlands (11): Engineers point way out of recession - Sectoral performance / Paul Cheeseright looks at different parts of the regional economy Engineering companies across the region have been reporting fatter order-books during the past three quarters. There is more optimism than at any time since 1990. 'Companies were very nervous at the start, but latterly it seems to be generally accepted that business in most sectors has improved considerably,' said Mr David Botterill, chief executive of the Engineering Employers' Federation West Midlands. But recovery is by no means uniform. The leading performers have been the automotive and the electronic sectors. The laggards have been companies tied into the aerospace and construction industries. Thus, on one hand, Rover reported a 9 per cent increase in volume sales over the first three quarters of the year, and announced the recruitment of 1,450 new staff; and Lucas Automotive reported a 13 per cent increase in sales for the year to last July. On the other hand, Lucas Aerospace also reported difficult conditions in the aerospace markets, and predicted little improvement until 1995-96, while smaller groups active in the sector, such as Hampson Industries and TransTec, saw their profits deteriorate. Mr Botterill noted that, in the electronics sector, performance was strong where sales related to the automotive industry or to machine tools and investment equipment. Significantly, in that context, production this year at Cincinnati Milacron, the machine tool maker in Birmingham, has been running at double the rate of 1993. But in the consumer electronics sector, the performance has not been so strong. Despite the overall improvement in the performance of the sector, immediate problems remain. Pressure on margins remains very tight. 'In the third year of recovery, margin replenishment has not gone as far as one would have expected,' said Mr Botterill. Indeed, customers are resisting price rises, and manufacturers are being forced to absorb increases in raw material prices. More fundamentally, the pressure on the original equipment manufacturers to reduce the number of their component suppliers, most noticeably in the automotive and aerospace sectors, is resulting in continuing rationalisation among component makers as they strain to retain their competitive position. The West Midlands is acutely sensitive to such changing commercial patterns. This follows from the structure of manufacturing, the heart of which is in Birmingham. 'There is a marked specialisation in a narrow range of inter-linked engineering industries, specialising in the production of motor vehicles, investment goods and associated components and materials,' noted the Birmingham Economic Information Centre (BEIC). This concentration did not serve the city well in the 1980s when growth was rapid in sectors such as computer hardware, pharmaceuticals, aerospace, plastics and electronics. More recently, restructuring has tended to concentrate on the introduction of new technology, which, in turn, has eliminated more basic metal-bashing. Over the past two years, the engineering sector has underpinned the movement out of recession. BEIC predicts, between now and the year 2005, annual growth rates of more than 3 per cent in the city's production of metal goods, more than 6 per cent in electrical, electronic and instrument engineering, and more than 4 per cent in motor vehicles. 'We need a long period of low inflation, consequent low interest rates and sustainable levels of investment,' said Mr Botterill. PROFILE: Grove Industries. The acquisitive group, based in Stratford-upon-Avon and run by Mr David Groves, is looking for engineering companies to add to its collection of interests in press work, machined components and injection moulding. The group, which this year will make pre-tax profits of about Pounds 2m on turnover of Pounds 40m, is half owned by Close Brothers, the London merchant bank and half by Mr Groves. Close uses Grove as a vehicle for its investment in manufacturing. Like its peers, Grove is finding trading conditions easier but not easy. 'The economy is quite buoyant. There's a lot of pressure on margins. In the past when the UK started to generate growth of 3 per cent, then companies were able to push prices up and enhance margins. That is not happening at the moment,' Mr Groves said. 'I see varying signs of inflation. I see a labour situation where there is a shortage of skilled labour and managerial talent. There's also a significant increase in raw material prices, especially over the last six months,' he added, noting polypropylene price increases of 25 per cent and paper and board increases of 20 per cent. As a sub-contractor, Grove is intent on building long-term relations with the systems makers. 'We've developed technical teams whereby they are able to help with re-engineering the products and reducing the costs.' It is the key to staying in the game. 'We want to be involved with design, work alongside, make them more reliant on us, as we are on them.'</p>

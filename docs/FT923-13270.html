			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy trade in HSBC THE FIRST day's trading in HSBC (Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation) as a constituent of London's FT-SE 100-share Index saw the shares race higher both in London and Hong Kong. Investors were additionally encouraged by news that the bank had sold its 10 per cent stake in the Hong Kong airline Cathay Pacific. HSBC's entry into the Footsie, following its successful takeover of Midland Bank, triggered a flurry of buying from Footsie tracking funds. The shares rose 7 1/2 to 348p and were the most heavily traded on the London market with turnover reaching 22.5m. The sale of the 10 per cent shareholding in Cathay Pacific was viewed positively by banking specialists, who said they expected HSBC shares to continue to move ahead. Demand for Fisons Pharmaceuticals group Fisons recovered sharply as UK merchant bank Kleinwort Benson decided that the price had fallen too far. The house already had the stock on its buy list and was telling clients that the fundamental value of the company's drugs, marketing infrastructure and R &amp; D pipeline were 'in excess of the current share price'. Kleinwort also believes that if Fisons does not sort out its manufacturing problems a hostile bid of at least 350p a share is a possibility. The stock, which had fallen after end-of-account bear-raiding on Friday, closed 16 better at 205p. Hints that institutional investors overweight in Glaxo might be adjusting portfolios in readiness for the forthcoming Wellcome issue reacted against last week's buying and sent Glaxo 20 lower to 690p. There was a further deflation of sentiment after an article in the US press reiterated concern about side-effects from the anti-migraine drug Sumatriptan, which Glaxo markets in the UK as Imigran. It also cited possible rivals to the group's ulcer drug Zantac. Wellcome picked up 3 to 878p. SmithKline Beecham held up well as both the 'A' shares and the units were split to allow for an easier comparison between the two. The 'A' stock closed at 454p, slightly firmer than the 904p mid price before the two-for-one split. The units were affected by a 10-for-one split and closed at 412p, against an opening price of 4098p. Barclays was a casualty in an otherwise buoyant banking arena, as the shares continued to react to increasing worries about a dividend cut. The bank is scheduled to announce interim figures on August 6. The stock was also affected by further switching from Barclays into National Westminster. Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken advised the switch last week. Barclays finished 4 lower at 316p and NatWest moved forward 4 to 339p. Lloyds Bank delivered another good performance, although dealers said the rise of 8 to 435p owed more to a continuing stock shortage than any surge of buying. TSB continued to intrigue banking specialists as long-running rumours of a possible stake-building operation as a prelude to a full bid continued to circulate. The shares settled 6 higher at 148p on 6.1m traded, with dealers noting above-average turnover in recent sessions and increased activity in the traded options. Lloyds, which lost out in the battle for control of Midland Bank, has been rumoured as a potential bidder for TSB, although it has played down the stories. The composite insurance sector, which fell 9 per cent relative to the wider market last month, lost further ground amid growing concern about the safety of dividends in the sector. General Accident, labelled 'expensive' by County NatWest, which says the stock trades at a 10 per cent premium to net asset value as opposed to discounts by all the other composites, weakened 9 to 418p. ICI lost 20 to 1143p as last week's end of account speculation that Goldman Sachs had offloaded its alleged 10m-share stake in the group died away. There had been a rumour that one securities house was prepared to take stock from Goldman at 1150p a share and also that Goldman had been active in the futures market last week. A downgrade in Courtaulds left the shares off 11 at 502p. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew cut its forecast for the year ending March 1993 by Pounds 10m to Pounds 210m and the following year's by Pounds 15m to Pounds 230m. The revision follows a recent and heavy Smith New Court profits downgrade last month of its biggest UK competitor, ICI. Smith is also adjusting its Courtaulds figure but is not believed to be as bearish as UBS. Chemicals distribution group Ellis &amp; Everard fell 13 to 172p. The group announced that the chairman was leaving after 'management differences' in the company and revealed a 27 per cent profits slide to Pounds 9.1m. Preliminary results from Tomkins, showing profits at the top end of market expectations and a 15 per cent increase in the dividend, were given a warm response by the market. The shares were hoisted 12 to 471p in turnover of 1.2m. P &amp; O's recent uncomfortable ride in the stock market continued and the shares lost 10 to 388p. They were said to have been weakened by an overhang of stock apparently sold into the market last week as part of a programme trade. The biggest casualty in the oil sector was Enterprise, which receded 7 to 371p following a Nomura downgrade. Confident trading noises continued to emanate from Cadbury-Schweppes, the shares adding 5 at 474p. Among retailers, Morrison Supermarkets firmed a penny to 120p ahead of a London presentation this week, as did Argyll, to 355p, with an encouraging agm expected tomorrow. Some switching from Tesco, where margins are said to be suffering, into J. Sainsbury left the former 2 off at 253p and the latter ahead 4 at 451p. In a quiet leisure sector, Thorn EMI found favour as Hoare Govett put the group on its weekly top buy list, having decided that the stock had reached the bottom of its relative trading range. The shares gained 9 to 803p in meagre turnover. Interest rate concern and dividend worries hit a number of leading property shares. Great Portland Estates declined 7 to 123p, Hammerson 'A' 11 to 285p, MEPC 8 to 258p and Slough Estates 15 to 125p. Media buying company Aegis, which had fallen on Friday after a broker's sell note, bounced 4 to 43p. Confirmation of a Pounds 30m contract for 150 armoured cars was not enough to prevent GKN dipping 4 to 381p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (10).

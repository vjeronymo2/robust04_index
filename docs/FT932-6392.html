			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / MMC hits at Boots' pricing of contact lens solutions THE GOVERNMENT is to lift restrictions on the sale of contact lens solutions. The decision follows a monopolies investigation which found that Allergan, the leading manufacturer, and Boots, the UK's largest chemists chain, had kept prices artificially high. The Department of Health said yesterday that it planned early next month to authorise sales of the solutions by any retailer with adequate arrangements for storage and product recall. It expected the change to make the products as widely available as aspirin. At present, retail sales of lens solutions are limited to about 17,000 opticians and chemists. The Monopolies and Mergers Commission said in a report yesterday that the restrictions had inhibited price competition in the market, worth Pounds 91m last year at retail prices. The MMC said the US-owned Allergan had exploited weak retail competition to charge prices which generated exceptionally large profits. The report found Boots had failed to pass on to consumers low prices it had obtained from suppliers and had tried to prevent competitors from cutting retail prices. Allergan welcomed the government's decision. But Boots said it was 'disappointed and surprised that the MMC has concluded that price is of prime, indeed sole, importance in this complex market'. Any change in the rules must not compromise product effectiveness and safety. The MMC found that Boots' gross margins on contact lens solutions were higher than on its retail sales overall. Boots said its margins reflected investments in customer service and the need to provide professional advice to consumers. However, the MMC said: 'Boots' practice of selling all branded contact lens solutions at recommended retail prices provides a shelter for other retailers to do the same, while its powerful position deters others from risking retaliation if they were to cut prices significantly.' Superdrug, the drugstore chain owned by Kingfisher, said it planned to sell the solutions at discount prices in all its 608 outlets as soon as it was allowed to. The chain sells perfumes, suntan products and condoms at discounts of as much as 30 per cent. The government said it was committed to implementing at the start of 1995 an EC directive intended to free cross-border sales of the solutions and other products. It also planned talks with opticians' professional bodies on ways to improve information to consumers about the cost of contact lens care. Boots blamed over costs, Page 9</p>

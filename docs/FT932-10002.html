			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / International Company News: KOP increases rights issue on strong demand FINLAND'S leading commercial bank, Kansallis-Osake-Pankki (KOP), is increasing the size of its FM930m rights issue after receiving subscriptions for just over FM1bn (Dollars 186m). The bank said yesterday it would issue a further 7.05m shares to three Finnish companies to raise an additional FM70.5m. The total FM1bn capital increase strengthens the group's financial position considerably and raises its international capital adequacy ratio by more than 1 percentage point to over 9 per cent. The bank plans to raise a further FM2bn in the domestic and international debt markets through a series of issues beginning in the autumn. If these are successful and there is no further worsening in the Finnish economy, it is confident it can survive the Finnish banking crisis without direct state support. KOP reported a FM3.7bn loss in 1992, but it expects its deficit this year to fall to FM2bn after the cut in Finnish interest rates and reduced credit losses.</p>

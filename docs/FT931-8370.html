			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Sony profits fall 62% to Y50bn THE continuing weakness of Japanese consumer spending and adverse currency movements contributed to a decline in third-quarter consolidated sales and profits at Sony, the Japanese electronics group. Sales in the three months ended December fell nearly 4 per cent to Y1,082bn (Pounds 6.3bn) from Y1,125bn previously. Pre-tax profits dropped more dramatically by 62 per cent to Y50.6bn, although this was largely due to an extraordinary gain following the issue of shares by Sony Music Entertainment in the previous year. Discounting the effect of the 1991 extraordinary gain, pre-tax profits fell by 27 per cent. Europe showed the steepest decline of all Sony's important markets, with sales falling by 10 per cent to Y310.8bn, although Japan followed closely with an 8.6 per cent fall in sales to Y257.3bn. In contrast, sales in the US were up 1.2 per cent to Y330.6bn, although this was affected by the weakness of the dollar against the yen. In dollar terms sales were up by 12 per cent. Among products, video recorders and camcorders suffered the largest reduction in sales of nearly 12 per cent. Audio sales also fell 6 per cent, while TV sales increased by 10 per cent on the strength of worldwide demand for computer displays from the computer industry and the popularity of Sony's flatter screen TV in the US. While music sales were down by 4 per cent, in dollar terms music entertainment rose 16 per cent. Film entertainment, however, saw a decline of 8 per cent even in dollar terms, although this was also due to an extraordinary gain in the previous third quarter, Sony said. Sony has not changed its projections for the next fiscal year since it reduced its forecast in November to sales of Y3,950bn, or a 3 per cent increase. The company reports that sales of MiniDiscs, its new digital compact disc format which is competing for the portable digital audio market with Philips's Digital Compact Cassette, are strong. Sony is increasing its initial monthly production of 30,000 MiniDisc units to between 40,000 and 50,000. The number of software titles is expected to rise to between 1,250 and 1,500 by the end of the year.</p>

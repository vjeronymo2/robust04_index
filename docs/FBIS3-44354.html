			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Comprehensive report" by staff reporters from Shanghai, </F> Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Fujian, and Zhuhai on 30 December:  "Unification of Renminbi Exchange Rates Well Received in Various  Localities; Foreign Exchange Markets Quiet, Prices Stable"]    [Text] After the news was made public last night that  China would unify the renminbi exchange rates as of 1 January  1994, the renminbi exchange rates stabilized at 8.7 yen to the  U.S. dollar yesterday. Foreign trade departments,  product-exporting enterprises, and foreign businessmen generally  welcome this measure, but the black market price for foreign  exchange certificates [FEC] fell on the announcement.    Shanghai: After the news was announced that the renminbi  exchange rates would be unified as of 1 January, there was a  strong reaction in Shanghai, China's largest economic city.    Our reporter has learned from foreign exchange "speculators"  that no one wants to ask about the FECs, which previously were  as attractive as the U.S. dollar. The exchange rate between the  FEC and the renminbi has dropped from 1:1.4 to 1:1.1. With the  abolition of foreign exchange settlements, it will be easy to  exchange foreign currencies into renminbi. Many black market  traders think it will be very difficult to operate in the black  market in the future.    Chinese residents have a lot of FECs. To prevent them from  devaluating further, many people are shopping in foreign-related  arcades, bringing about extraordinarily brisk business. Take  the well-known Shanghai Friendship Store as an example. As it  is still less expensive to buy gold with FECs than with  renminbi, the turnover in gold ornaments doubled today.    There has been no great change in terms of transaction  volume  at the Shanghai Foreign Exchange Swap Center today, but more  small traders are selling U.S. dollars. The central bank has  absorbed more than $6.3 million. The swap center finally closed  at 8.7 yen to the dollar, which has remained at this level for  several months.    Moreover, the Shanghai Foreign Exchange Swap Center --  China's largest -- today closed the last foreign exchange swap  transactions for 1993 with an annual transaction volume of over  $5 billion.    Guangzhou: The market reaction in Guangzhou is quiet today  and the foreign exchange swap market is operating normally.    As provided by the Guangzhou Foreign Exchange Swap Center,  from today's swap exchange price for individuals, we can see  that since the small readjustments on 24 December, there have  been no changes in exchange rates so far. The spot exchange  buying price is 825 yuan per 100 U.S. dollars; the banknote  buying price is 815 yuan; and the selling price for spot  exchange and banknotes is 877 yuan. The rate between the Hong  Kong dollar and the renminbi is: Buying price -- 100:107 for  spot exchange and 100:106 for banknotes; Selling price --  100:114 for both spot exchange and banknotes.    A person in the trade holds that the unification of exchange  rates does not have a major impact on foreign exchange swap  business, either for individuals or for enterprises. A person  in charge of the deposits and exchange swap section of the  Guangzhou branch office of the Bank of China said: Since the  launch of foreign exchange swap business, most foreign exchange  business has been operated according to foreign exchange swap  prices. For this reason, the effect on business following the  exchange rate unification is very small.    A person in charge of the Guangdong Foreign Exchange Swap  Center stressed: Following the unification of exchange rates,  the terms under which enterprises use foreign exchange will be  relaxed. To a certain extent, this will ease the situation in  Guangzhou in which demand for foreign exchange is greater than  the supply.    When commenting on the unification of exchange rates and  other new measures for reforming the foreign exchange management  system, Xu Dezhi, chairman of the Guangdong Provincial  Commission for Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, said:  Although these measures come under reform of the banking  system, they are principally operated in the foreign trade  field. In his view, these measures are very favorable to the  expansion of foreign trade and exports.    Fuzhou: After the news on the unification of exchange rates  was announced, the price of foreign currency dropped on the  black market today. It dropped from 8.63-8.65 yuan to the U.S.  dollar yesterday to 8.6 yen today. According to a foreign  exchange speculator, the price will contionue to fall tomorrow.  This is because the unification of renminbi exchange rates will  deprive speculators of the chance to make profits from the "dual  price system."    Shenzhen: Since it was rumored that the state would further  reform the foreign exchange management system as of New Year's  Day, the reaction in Shenzhen's banking sector is calm today.  There has not been any abnormal situation.    The listed exchange rate between the renminbi and the U.S.  dollar remians 8.7:1, as it has been in the past few days.  Since FECs are not widely circulated in Shenzhen, there is no  problem of a drop in the exchange rate of the FEC. As for the  argument that the circulation of foreign currencies is banned in  China, the public here generally hold that there is a special  reason for Hong Kong dollars to circulate in certain places in  Shenzhen. It is unlikely that it will not be used any longer in  the near future and therefore there have been no major sales of  Hong Kong dollars.    Zhuhai: There has been no change in the swap price for  renminbi in Zhuhai today. It remains as it has been in the past  few days.    Although Zhuhai residents learned from the newspapers and  television that the exchange rates of the renminbi would be  unified as of 1 January, the reaction has been calm.    It also has been learned that the Zhuhai Foreign Exchange  Swap Center will not open for business on 1 and 2 January  because of the holidays. The initial market reaction to the  unification of the renminbi exchange rates will be known on 3  January.</p>

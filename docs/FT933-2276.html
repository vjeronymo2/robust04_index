			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Former ministers face Iraq arms probe The arms-for-Iraq inquiry enters its most overtly political phase today when Mr Timothy Renton, former Foreign Office minister and chief government whip, becomes the first in a line of senior ministers to give evidence in public. He will be followed during the week by Mr David Mellor, who resigned from the cabinet last autumn in the midst of a row over his personal life, and by Mr William Waldegrave, who remains a serving minister. Lord Justice Scott and his abrasive counsel Miss Presiley Baxendale QC are likely to subject the ministers to a detailed grilling. Jimmy Burns looks at the evidence given so far and poses the questions that the politicians may face from the inquiry. Timothy Renton, Foreign Office minister from October 1985 to June 1987 Why did Sir Geoffrey Howe, the foreign secretary, take nearly a year to announce guidelines restricting arms exports to Iraq? Mr Renton's predecessor Sir Richard Luce told the inquiry he wanted the guidelines, which had been agreed secretly by ministers in November 1984, to be announced to the Commons. He had to accept the majority government view that the guidelines 'trickle out' before being announced in October 1985 when Mr Renton was in the post. What did you know about the Pounds 270m defence package Britain signed with Jordan in September 1985? Evidence to the inquiry suggests the government agreed to the package in spite of knowing that Jordan was being used as a route for military exports to Iraq. What was said at meetings in London held on December 4 1985 between government ministers - including the prime minister, Mrs Margaret Thatcher - and Mr Tariq Aziz, Iraq's foreign minister? Officially all Mr Aziz wanted, and apparently got, was an asurance that the UK would remain neutral in the Iran-Iraq war and sell no arms to Iran. But the Foreign Office was under pressure from other government departments to approve pending contracts with Iraq including one for a missile complex arranged by IMS, a defence company wholly owned by the Ministry of Defence. How did you apply the guidelines that the UK should not export defence equipment which would enhance the capability of either side to exacerbate the conflict? Mr Paul Channon, former trade secretary, said the MoD and the Foreign Office 'changed the rules as they went along'. William Waldegrave, Foreign Office minister from July 1988 to November 1990, currently minister for open government What did you know about the export of British machine tools to Iraq by companies such as Matrix-Churchill? In February 1989 Mr Waldegrave, together with other ministers, approved the export to Iraq by Matrix-Churchill of sophisticated lathe equipment which Whitehall knew could be used in the development of nuclear weapons. The Whitehall line was that intelligence on Iraq provided by Matrix-Churchill outweighed the potential nuclear threat, an argument that Mr Waldegrave seemed at one point to have shared. Last week Mr David Gore-Booth, a former senior Foreign Office official, suggested that the trade and defence ministries may have withheld intelligence information from Mr Waldgrave. When and how did you learn about the UK involvement in Iraq's supergun project? According to Mr Paul Henderson, a Matrix-Churchill executive, detailed intelligence about the project was sent to the Cabinet in October 1989. Yet six months later Mr Nicholas Ridley, the trade and industry secretary, told the House of Commons that the government had only recently become aware 'in general terms' of the project. David Mellor, Foreign Office minister from June 1987 to July 1988 What did you know about the export of British machine-tools to Iraq by companies such as Matrix-Churchill? During 1987 and 1988, Whitehall officials recommended the export of British machine-tools even though intelligence information suggested that the Iraqi factories for which they were destined were involved in making munitions, both nuclear and chemical. In January 1988 a Foreign Office official working under Mr Mellor recommended that because of the threatened UN arms embargo, British manufacturers 'should be warned of the falling guillotine and urged to produce as fast as they can'. At issue is whether the minister acquiesced in the apparent breach of the government's guidelines. What did you tell Iraqi president Saddam Hussein when you visited Baghdad on February 23 1988? Two days later the Iraqi government released Mr John Smith, a British businessman jailed on suspicion of spying. This was followed by a Foreign office announcement of a campaign for a world ban on arms sales to Iran. From Baghdad, Mr Mellor went to Jordan. What was ministerial policy towards countries suspected of being used as a conduit for arms to Iraq? In documents which were made available to the Scott inquiry Saudi Arabia is identified as a country 'known or suspected' of diverting sensitive defence-related equipment in 1987 and 1988.</p>

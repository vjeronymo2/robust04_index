			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Books: Funny Girl with a torch - Anthony Curtis reads a new biography of Broadway legend Fanny Brice FANNY BRICE: THE ORIGINAL FUNNY GIRL by Herbert J. Goldman Oxford Pounds 17.50, 308 pages 'NO OTHER comedian succeeded so well in giving expression to the life of that audience, in raising it to a kind of art.' TS Eliot's encomium of Marie Lloyd applies equally well to Fanny Brice. In her case, it was the life of the largely Jewish audience of New York's Lower East Side in the 1920s that she raised to 'a kind of art' - but let us throw caution to the winds and just say to Art. Fanny, whose ebullient personality was re-created in the Broadway musical (and later film) Funny Girl, was born Fania Borach to a New York Jewish couple in 1891. The family of Rose, her mother, came from Hungary and that of Charlie, her father, from French Alsace. The name Brice was borrowed from Irish friends by Fanny when, as a young girl, she began to get work as an entertainer. Fanny used a Yiddish intonation in her early comedy routines. This tone, cultivated deliberately, was not exactly her ordinary voice. From the start of her career, she plugged the ethnic strain to create a unique rapport with her audience. 'Mrs Cohen at the beach' became one of Fanny's standards, a one-woman sketch she performed over many years, giving rise ultimately to impressions by other comediennes of Fanny doing it. Luckily, a recording of Fanny herself doing it exists. Like a gutsy Joyce Grenfell, and at about six times the speed, Fanny, in her monologue as Mother, evokes the presence of all the others as they picnic on the beach at Coney Island. A deckchair attendant suddenly appears and demands she pay for one of the children occupying a deckchair. 'But she's only five years old,' protests Fanny. 'Only five] She looks much older,' he ripostes. To which comes the reply: 'Can I help it if she worries?' It was from these vaudevillian beginnnings that Fanny, a gawky lady with a prominent nose, graduated to becoming the elegant Broadway legend re-incarnated in 1968 and 1975 by Barbra Streisand in the films Funny Girl and Funny Lady. Those visually stunning biopic movies were produced by Ray Stark, the husband of Fanny's daughter, Frances. Did they bear any relation to the original Fanny? A new biography of Fanny, written brashly but compiled painstakingly, gives the answer. The outline of Fanny's chequered life, including her second and third husbands - Nick Arnstein (Omar Sharif) and Billy Rose (James Caan) - was broadly accurate. Fanny's slapsticky song 'Sadie Salome Go Home' was replaced by Styne and Sondheim's clever, catchy 'Sadie, Sadie, Married Lady' and, by the end, the female Jewish clown was eclipsed by Streisand's elegant, agonised torch singer. The torch song, in which Fanny specialised when she became a star, came into fashion in the prohibition era. A female singer would come on in a dimly-lit speakeasy to shed a flood of illumination on her inner life. This always concerned a man - or, rather, 'That Man' - to whom she was in a state of hopeless emotional bondage; a man who was unfaithful to her systematically and disappeared without trace for days on end; a man who was a complete dead loss in every way except one. The standard contents of the torch song mirrored exactly the course of Fanny's second marriage (the first one lasted only a few days) to the shady wheeler-dealer and gambler Nick Arnstein, by whom she had two children and to whom she remained loyal during his spells in prison. Fanny took the torch song out of the speakeasy and on to Broadway as a show-stopping item in the Ziegfeld Follies, where she was one of its greatest stars. Her famous song 'My Man' was acquired from Paris, where it had been sung since the turn of the century by Mistinguette as 'Mon Homme' (in whose rendering it sounds like 'marn-arm-er'). Cleaned up a little in the words, but with the same infectious music by Maurice Yvain, it served Fanny extraordinarily well. After Arnstein came Billy Rose, a small man with vast showbiz ambition and mafia connections. His alliance with Fanny lasted harmoniously for a number of years as he grew in power and influence in the entertainment industry. Then, Billy cheated with the main attraction of one of his swimming spectaculars, the ex-Olympic champion Eleanor Holm. Saul Bellow in his wonderful novella about modern American Jewishness, The Bellarosa Connection, sees deeply into Rose's character under the guise of fiction. So, finally, did Fanny and divorced him. By then, she was getting a little too old to appear in glamorous roles on stage and, in her private life, she preferred the company of women friends like Beatrice Lillie. She turned down an offer of re-marriage by the 70-year-old Arnstein. What saved her sanity, her professional pride and her bank balance was radio comedy in its golden era. Rose had noted Fanny's trick of lapsing into baby language when she was piqued, and he got Moss Hart to write a sketch for her as Babykins. By the Follies of 1936, the idea had evolved into the character Baby Snooks, a precocious infant who delivered home truths as uninhibitedly as Mr Bones in the old minstrel shows. Fanny appeared as Baby Snooks on radio in Maxwell House's Good News of 1938, after which Snooks became a radio series with an avid nationwide audience. It ran steadily until the 1950s, comparable in popularity and hilarity to Britain's Goon Show but with only one main star and massive commercial backing. In her last years, during the period after the Second World War, Fanny worked only in the broadcasting studio, rehearsing the latest episode of Snooks and spending the rest of her time as a lady of leisure. She died in 1951 leaving an estate worth Dollars 2m. The rabbi who gave the funeral address quoted from the Bible: 'The heart ennobles any calling . . . ' It would be good to have Fanny's comment capping that. Goldman's volume traces her career in full with many quotes from contemporary newspaper critics, and it includes useful lists of Fannyana covering books, magazine articles, records, stage, film and radio productions. Fanny does not seem ever to have appeared on television.</p>

			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DRUNK DRIVING SUSPECT FREED: COURT OVERLOADED  </P> <P> A young man facing trial on drunk-driving charges won a dismissal of his case  because the courts were too overloaded to handle him, said a judge who blamed  himself for the foul-up.  </P> <P> The case against Jeffrey Alan Griffin, 19, was dropped Wednesday when there was  no time for another trial in the Fullerton court.  </P> <P> Orange County Municipal Judge Ronald P. Kreber said he was partly to blame for  the incident because he missed a chance to postpone the case and did not see  the overload coming when he denied a defense request for a continuance.  </P> <P> "It could have been avoided," Kreber said.  </P> <P> Griffin was arrested July 27 on suspicion of drunk driving.  </P> <P> Tests showed his blood-alcohol content to be 0.14%, above the legal threshold  of 0.10%.  </P></p>

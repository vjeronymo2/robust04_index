			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Khmer Rouge says it will not accept Cambodia poll CAMPAIGNING for the United Nations-sponsored election in Cambodia next month began on an ominous note yesterday when the extreme left-wing Khmer Rouge guerrilla group reaffirmed its opposition to the poll and said it would not respect the result. The Khmer Rouge made its announcement as Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, arrived in Phnom Penh to give his backing to one of the largest and most expensive peace-keeping operations in UN history. In Brussels, the European Community expressed concern about repeated ceasefire violations in Cambodia. Peace and security, without intimidation were needed for the elections, the EC said. It urged all parties to accept the outcome. The Khmer Rouge, which has refused to abide by the peace accord signed by its leaders and those of the other Cambodian factions in Paris in October 1991, is not among the 20 political parties taking part in the May 23-27 elections and is suspected of planning to disrupt the voting. Mr Mak Ben, a Khmer Rouge spokesman, declined to give a direct answer when asked at a news conference if his organisation would disrupt the poll, saying only that it went 'against the spirit and letter of the Paris agreement'. 'It is in violation of the UN charter. It goes against the sacred right of self-determination of the Cambodian people. . . We will never accept the result of the election that will give legitimacy or a cloak of legitimacy to the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia.' The Paris agreement specifically provides for the election and commits the signatories to respect the results, but the Khmer Rouge has repeatedly complained that Vietnamese troops remain in Cambodia in breach of the agreement. Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1978, overthrowing the brutal Khmer Rouge regime and installing the present administration in Phnom Penh. The UN's 22,000 military and civilian personnel have been unable to prevent an upsurge in violence as the elections approach. Last month more than 100 people were killed, many of them Vietnamese migrant fishermen massacred by gunmen thought to be members of the Khmer Rouge. Only last week three Bulgarian UN soldiers were killed by Khmer Rouge guerrillas they had invited to supper.</p>

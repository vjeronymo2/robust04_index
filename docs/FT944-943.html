			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Italy searches for new prime minister Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, resigned yesterday, leaving President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro with the delicate choice of finding a new government or dissolving parliament. Mr Berlusconi, in office for 226 days at the head of a rightwing coalition, is pressing for early elections to vindicate his views and obtain a fresh mandate. But the president has made clear that he will explore all options and that he opposes the dissolution of parliament so soon after the March 1994 general election. A solution has been complicated both by the increasingly polarised political atmosphere and by divisions within the populist Northern League, a coalition partner, over the decision by Mr Umberto Bossi, its leader, to bring a no-confidence motion against the government. Financial markets showed some relief that the lingering fate of the government had been decided. But the Bank of Italy's latest monthly figures on foreign exchange reserves reflected the impact of the sustained pressure on the lira, with losses of more than L11,000bn (Pounds 4.27bn) since July. 'The government's resignation unfortunately confirms the prospect of a long and difficult transition towards a new politico-institutional alignment,' observed Mr Luigi Abete, the head of Confindustria, the industrialists' confederation. The Northern League proposed the no-confidence motion last weekend together with the centrist Popular party. The former communist Party of the Left (PDS) put forward a second no-confidence motion, and a third came from Reconstituted Communism, the hardline core of the old Italian Communist party. Mr Berlusconi resigned before the end of the no-confidence debate, in part to avoid the provisions of the league motion. One clause of this would have barred him from future office because of the conflict of interest resulting from his ownership of the Fininvest business empire. Throughout his eight-month government, Mr Berlusconi has been at odds with the head of state and their hostile relationship will influence the outcome of this crisis. The president is expected to do his best to avoid asking Mr Berlusconi to either head a new government or be in charge of anything other than the shortest of caretaker administrations. He regards the outgoing prime minister as in good measure responsible for his own downfall. Mr Scalfaro is concerned about the unresolved questions of conflict of interest and Mr Berlusconi's investigation by Milan anti-corruption magistrates. Yesterday, the Milan judiciary reminded Mr Berlusconi of his potential difficulties when they sentenced his younger brother, Paolo, to seven months in prison for corruption related to waste disposal contracts. Mr Scalfaro will begin preliminary soundings with two former Italian presidents today, but the core discussions with political leaders will be held next week.

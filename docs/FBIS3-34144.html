			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Press review] </F>   [Text] The newspaper TISHRIN says: Israeli discourse on  peace in the Middle East and the prospects for achieving it is  lopsided. This discourse misrepresents facts, and is full of  contradictions.    The paper discusses statements by Israeli Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres, in which he said that the dispute with Syria  concerns substantive issues, contending that the problem lies in  the level of representation in the negotiations.    TISHRIN reacts to these statements, saying: If the problem  concerns substance rather than form, why then this Israeli  determination to continue to raise the issue of representation  in the negotiations, particularly since the negotiations should  not be an end in itself? As a matter of fact, the negotiations  should be a means to achieve an end; namely, the attainment of  just and comprehensive peace, which should not lend itself to  various interpretations and over which there should be no  bargaining.    TISHRIN adds: Middle East peace must be just and  comprehensive. It must be grounded in the relevant international  resolutions. It must also result in the return of the  territories to their rightful Arab owners, as called for in the  relevant UN Security Council resolutions, which provide for the  complete Israeli withdrawal from all the Arab territories  occupied in 1967; namely, the Gaza Strip, Jerusalem, and the  Golan, not to mention the unconditional Israeli withdrawal from  southern Lebanon in implementation of Resolution 425.    TISHRIN wonders: Why has Israel failed to respond to the  ideas and principles reiterated by leader al-Asad at the Geneva  summit--the very ideas and principles which were accepted and,  indeed, espoused by the United States to accelerate the peace  process?    The paper says: The United States has also acknowledged  Syria's leading role in the peace process. The ball now is in  the Israeli court. Israel is well aware that had it, at least,  heeded the Madrid conference formula, and sincerely honored the  provisions enshrined in the U.S. peace initiative, chief among  which is the provision regarding the principle of exchanging  land for peace, the peace process would not have run into all  these snags, difficulties, and traps. Similarly, the peace  process would not have reached a dead end.    In one of its articles, the newspaper AL-THAWRAH comments on  the evasive Israeli policy toward the peace process, saying:  Israel, which has flooded the world with sweet words,  particularly after the Labor Party assumed power, has concluded  the Gaza-Jericho accord with the Palestinians to evade  commitment to the peace process as outlined at the Madrid  conference.    The paper adds: Israel forced its dictates and conditions in  the vague Gaza-Jericho accord, the implementation of which has  run into difficulties, although it is an Israeli formulation for  Palestinian autonomy. Since the conclusion of this accord,  Israel has been promoting partial settlements, contending that  it needs time to digest the Oslo accord. This shows a desire on  its part to evade commitment to the peace process. It is to be  recalled that Israel showed a great reluctance to join this  process in Madrid in the first place.    The paper addresses the Israeli stand toward the Syrian role  in the peace process, saying: Israel has rediscovered that it  cannot overlook Syria's role and position, which have been  acknowledged by the U.S. Administration and the world at large.  The entire world community has realized that Syria has a basic  and important role to play on all tracks of the negotiations.  This role is required if just and comprehensive peace is to be  achieved, and if the region is to enjoy security and stability.    The paper concludes by saying: Syria has constantly  reiterated its stand toward peace, which must be grounded in the  relevant international legitimacy resolutions passed by the UN  Security Council. This is essential if peace is to be just and  comprehensive. Such peace will certainly benefit the region  and the world at large.</p>

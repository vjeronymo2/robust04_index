			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As it has become obvious to everyone who understands the process that the stock of converting institutions often trades up sharply on the first day of issue, those who control mutual institutions have become more and more interested in converting. Managers and even non-executive trustees have been awarded free stock and options (at the subscription price). Employee Stock Ownership Plans (``ESOPs'') have been created and given priority in buying stock. These and other devices have resulted in substantial transfers of value. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As it has become clear that most conversions would be oversubscribed, the ``allocation'' process has clearly been subject to abuse. For example, we have been told that in transactions where allocations were likely to be based on size of deposit because of expected oversubscription, insiders and others in a position to know the relevant record date have been able to transfer large amounts of money into their accounts on that single day. Where the right to subscribe has been limited to long-term depositors, or depositors with local addresses, we are told that professionals are sometimes able to persuade other depositors to ``front'' for them (despite rules to the contrary).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Problems With Appraisals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As market valuation of thrifts has risen (and as conversions have come to be oversubscribed, with stocks generally trading up), the integrity of the appraisal process has been compromised. The FDIC's experience with appraisals is that they typically follow a certain pattern. A ``peer group'' of stock savings institutions is identified. (How they were selected out of the much larger universe of potential ``peers'' typically is not well explained.) The peer group market/book ratio is calculated. It is then stated that the converting institution should be valued (on a pro forma basis) at a discount from that ratio. Two reasons for this are typically given. The first is that the converting mutual is actually inferior to the peer group_which raises the question, why were they chosen as peers in the first place. The second, discussed below, is the need for a ``new issue discount.'' (Price/earnings ratios are also calculated, but there is rarely a cogent analysis of the converting institution's earnings potential once it appropriately deploys its new capital.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At March 31, 1994, the thrift industry average market/book ratio was 99% and the median was 95%. (At year-end 1993, those figures were five percentage points higher, a year before that 15 percentage points lower.) The market tends to value recently converted institutions below the industry average_primarily, in our judgment, because the return on a newly converted institution's book, or capital, will be low by industry standards until it is able to leverage the new capital it raises in the conversion. During 1992 and 1993 as a whole, the average market/book ratio of a newly converted institution, at the end of the first day of trading, was 72%. To meet the ``appraisal'' requirement that an institution's stock trade at what it was sold for in a situation where a 72% market/book ratio was a reasonable expectation, a mutual would have to more than triple its capital base. To be precise, a mutual with a $100 million net worth would need to raise $257 million (ignoring expenses and the effects of establishing an ESOP or a management retention plan), since 72% of $357 million (the resulting book value) equals $257. It is extremely hard for a company in a highly competitive industry prudently to employ that much new capital.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> What appraisal firms did, in 1992 and 1993, was to ``appraise'' converted institutions on average at 57% of book. They did this despite the fact that, on average, these institutions traded up the first day by 26%.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appraisers' principal rationalization for this discrepancy has been that, in the context of an initial public offering, a ``new issue discount'' is required. While it is certainly true that it is difficult to bring a company public without pricing the shares at a level that stimulates unfilled demand_resulting in a ``pop''_we question the magnitude required in an environment where virtually all conversions are trading up. In some circumstances, the need for a ``new issue discount'' has been asserted in appraisal updates issued  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> after <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the end of the subscription period, and in the face of 100&hyph;300% oversubscriptions. We would also observe that the literal language of the OTS regulations and guidelines on conversion appraisals does not allow for a market discount. The question to be answered is: how much stock has to be sold to eliminate any ``pop''?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

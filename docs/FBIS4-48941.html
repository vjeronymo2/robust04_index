			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ma Zhiping: "Office Set To Ensure Just Deals"] </F>   [Text] A special department has been established by the  government to thwart the emergence of unfair competition on the  domestic market and prevent unauthorized monopoly of trade.    The new office -- the Department of Fair Trading under the  State Administration for Industry and Commerce -- is responsible  for ensuring fair competition and banning illegal monopolies in  the business sector, according to sources with the state  administration.    The department is also responsible for drafting rules  concerning fair trade and dealing with unethical trade cases.    Other obligations of the new State organ include  investigating and dealing with cases of illegal speculation,  protecting consumers rights and handling serious  consumer-related cases.    It will also oversee the implementation of business  contracts, while helping guide the resolution of economic  disputes in China's arbitration courts.    To eliminate unfair trading practices and illegal  monopolies,  China last year instituted a law governing unfair competition.  Another law to protect intellectual property rights has been  passed.    The government is further considering the introduction of a  new law banning illegal trade monopolies. It would supplement  the law governing unfair competition in a bid to ensure fair  trade, administration officials said.    The new law is expected to ban regional restrictive business  practices and unfair restraint of trade by public utilities,  such as cooking gas and electrical supply companies.    Unfair trade practices such as illegal lotteries to promote  sales and kickbacks in awarding business contracts are still  common in China. Cases that have been discovered have been  dealt with by the law, according to local reports.    A Hainan Province company was recently fined 10,000 yuan  ($1,150) for setting a top prize of 30,000 yuan ($3,448) in a  promotion activity. The prize was much higher than the law's  ceiling of 5,000 yuan ($575) for such awards.</p>

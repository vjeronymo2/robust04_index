			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> BEATTY LOSING HIS MYSTIQUE  </P> <P> Television producers say Warren Beatty is losing some of his mystique as he  heavily promotes his role in the movie "Dick Tracy."  </P> <P> "I would imagine the we-got-to-have-him attitude is somewhat diminished," Jack  Riley, executive producer of ABC's "Good Morning America," said in the July 7  issue of TV Guide.  </P> <P> "But actually, now that he's gotten into it, he's a far better interview than  he has been," he said.  </P> <P> Beatty had stonewalled seasoned interviewer Barbara Walters early on, and  producers were wary of the once elusive star.  </P> <P> "Donahue" senior producer Lorri Benson said she was "pleasantly surprised" by  Beatty's openness when he appeared on the syndicated show. There were no  preconditions and no taboo subjects, and Beatty spontaneously agreed to appear  on the show a second time, she said.  </P> <P> Riley also was leery of scheduling a Beatty interview. He had previously dealt  with the star when he was touting his mega-bomb "Ishtar." Beatty taped a  segment for "Good Morning America" but later made so many demands that the  producers "dumped the whole thing," Riley said.  </P> <P> The only constraint in the interview for "Dick Tracy" was that 11-year-old  co-star Charlie Korsmo be on with him.  </P></p>

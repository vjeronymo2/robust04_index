			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Gardening: Pick of the show, hostas with the mostest - Robin Lane Fox plans a leafy treat for himself after an exhausting time at Chelsea flower show UNTIL THIS Monday, I have always thought that in gardening circles, H T stands for a Hybrid Tea rose. Near the exit to Chelsea flower show, I learnt this week that it stands for something else: Horticultural Therapy, for those who want to garden but are disabled. By the Chelsea exit, all legs ache and the mind becomes hazy. The H T stand was strategically placed and a positive woman in navy blue explained with enthusiasm: No, H T could not help just now if my feet were about to fall off, but she could help if the worst came to the worst and I went blind, for example. Perhaps the colour-planners of most of the outdoor gardens at Chelsea have been needing H T all these years. They are still capable of some extraordinarily awful colour schemes which are not much of an advertisement for the great English garden: Wyevale gardens surprised all sensitive eyes this year with its attempted echo of Scotland. I thought the best was the Daily Mirror's design because it combined odd angles and not too many plants, all of a civilised colour. For once, I could imagine inhabiting a Chelsea exhibit for more than half an hour. This year, many exhibitors favoured the long-eared Lavender Stoechas, especially the pedunculata form, and the Mirror had majored on it, perhaps implying that it would be hardy in most of the British Isles. Do not be tempted, because it is not. The Daily Telegraph tried a different image of temptation, a Vision of Paradise with overtones sometimes said to be Persian, sometimes Islamic or sometimes simply Eastern. Much of the planting was pretty, although the Turkish sort of tent at the back was a bit rich: Moslems might be surprised to find this rather eclectic design claiming an historic semi-Islamic origin. Further down the bank, the heroic exhibitor of the first garden ever to be shown from Uzbekistan might have once known better what made a truly Eastern paradise. Years of political slavery and the backwash of modernism had reduced it to some hard and bright surfaces and beastly dots of red salvia. Horticulturally, the main therapy is always found inside the main tent. Each year, the smaller herbaceous nurseries consolidate their advance at the expense of many of the older and bigger enterprises. The grandeur of the 1950s has gradually faded. Most of the specialists in these smaller concerns have brought a greater sensitivity to colour and arrangement. Glebe Cottage, Foxgrove, Four Seasons and Rushfields are some of the names which show herbaceous plants with particular elegance. This year, Four Seasons from Norfolk had hit the mark superbly with a harmony of white, pale yellow and shades of pink. Meanwhile, Blooms of Bressingham, Norfolk, is there as a reminder that big can also be beautiful. Yet another fine exhibit from this large company encouraged me to follow up Hucherella Charles Bloom because its darkish leaves are not too sombre and its haze of peach-pink flowers looked exquisite. It will also grow in shade. At a lower height, the second Chelsea exhibit of the Hileys from south London was full of temptations and half-hardy rarities. We swopped notes on the winter deaths among penstemons, agreeing that the white had been hardest hit; we admired the aromatic leaves of their Salvia discolor and its black flowers; I was drawn to one of the old forms of mauve Cherry Pie which has to be bought as plants from cuttings because they smell so much more sweetly than any which grow nowadays from seed. Gardens could hardly have been hotter or more dry this week. Perhaps as a result, I was particularly drawn to a cool display of shade-loving plants from Paradise Centre, Lamarsh, Bures, Suffolk. The nursery is new to me, but one of its groupings seemed more like paradise than those from the Tory press. We do not often see superb Haberleas in a full display of pale lilac flower among Shooting Stars, or Dodecatheon, with tall stems, evidently grown outdoors. Indeed, the proprietress assured me that she had dug up some of the star turns from her own garden a day or two before. The accompanying publicity refers to 'harmonious birdsong, the gentle scurrying of squirrels and nearby paddocks with unusual African pygmy goats.' Nonetheless, these rare woodland plants seem to like it. My personal high spots were threefold. One was the very knowing show-person on an expert stand of alpine plants who pointed out the saxifrages growing happily in bits of tufa rock. High spot number two was the marvellous stand from Notcutts, once again the best of the big exhibitors of trees, shrubs and climbers. It arranges its lilacs so prettily and, in my mind's eye, I still see the arch of climbing plants on which Notcutts designers excel themselves. This year, it was clothed in wisteria, Yellow Rose Emily Gray and a wonderfully variegated honeysuckle called Harlequin which I will rush out and buy. Flowers, however, are not everything. For plain quality, my final high spot was the stand from Goldbrook, at Hoxne, Eye, Suffolk. Since 1988, its hostas have won gold medals and the owner, Sandra Bond, has emerged as the nursery trade's queen of this family. Hostas and their huge leaves are wonderful plants for exhibition when they revive and glisten at the touch of a hose. So many new varieties have been bred in Britain, America and Japan that we all need time to digest them and see them at maturity. Sandra Bond's display refutes the critics who wonder if new means better. The best are not cheap, but I could not resist the enormous leaves of one called Sum and Substance, which is not over-priced at Pounds 9. Somehow, my feet seemed to have survived Chelsea's crowds after all and my vision is no more peculiar than usual: for me, this year, H T will stand not for horticultural therapy but for an extravagant Hosta Treat.</p>

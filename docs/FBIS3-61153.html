			<p>Language: <F P=105> Armenian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Arpi Totoyan: "The Savior of Western Armenia: </F> Don Quixote II Bagratuni"]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] The 15 October issue of BANBER  in the latest batch of papers from Armenia features a gem of a  page for those who are not satisfied with important subjects.    BANBER bills itself as the "press organ of Armenia's  Christian Democratic Union." It is a compact weekly in four  pages and circulation of 5,000 edited by Khachatur Dadayan.  [passage omitted]    The second page of the said issue features an "Appeal" which  is designed to impress in the reader's mind the unique nature of  the weekly for a long time. The "Appeal" is addressed to "all  the Armenian political parties, ecclesiastical, political,  cultural, scientific and public organizations and businessmen of  the world." [passage omitted]    The "Appeal" is signed by "the grand prince of the Armenian  kingdom, Roland I Bagratuni-Antonian-Anetsi, heir to the  Armenian throne, king of kings, prince of princes, heir to the  throne of the Kingdom of Western Armenia." The most visible  participation of this person to the said "Appeal" seems to have  been the drawing "Roland I" at the bottom of the page. We call  it a "drawing" because the grand prince probably made his first  attempt to write in the Armenian script by drawing the letters  of his name possibly copying them from a signature given to  him--as I would have done if I had to sign my name in Japanese.  [passage omitted]    As for the contents of the "Appeal," it proclaims: "On 10  February 1994 we will create the emigre coalition government of  the Kingdom of Western Armenia and we will appoint the leaders  of provinces, kingdoms and principalities." Roland I found bases  for this step during his tour of Armenia and Karabakh, when it  was revealed during his "meetings with the leaders of most of  the political parties and organizations and representatives of  cultural, scientific and economic circles" that "the ancestors  of most Armenians are the victims of the 1915 genocide or have  been deported from their homes, and the Armenian question awaits  a solution to this day." [passage omitted]    Roland I's revelations are not limited to the fact that the  Armenian question remains unresolved. He was greatly rejoiced  when he "heard that Armenia won independence following the  dissolution of the Soviet Union." Unfortunately that joy was not  unmitigated because "the Armenian republic has not done anything  so far to find a solution to the problem of the 1915 genocide  through political and diplomatic means and to have western  Armenia returned to the homeland." Fortunately, this descendant  of the Bagratunis declares with a populism that does not befit a  man who aspires to become monarch: "Considering the will of the  Armenians of the entire world, we decided to participate  actively in this matter." This is followed by the declaration of  the formation of the emigre coalition government of the Kingdom  of Armenia and details are provided. The declaration says that a  constitution must be endorsed until 1995 by a "bicameral or  tricameral National Assembly" whose "deputies and senators,  numbering 250 to 350, will have been elected by the Armenian  communities of the world." The declaration adds that "the  Kingdom of Western Armenia must join the UN, NATO, the CIS and  the European Union." [passage omitted]    Despite its generally comical appearance, the "Appeal"  outlined above has a serious and disturbing aspect. The "ideas"  expressed, in their distorted western Armenian edited and  typeset by an eastern Armenian, betray the presence of a ladle  sticking in from outside--a ladle that does not belong to the  community that was dreamt by [19th century Catholicos] Khrimian.  The effect of that ladle is to disturb and to create discord.  The "Appeal" is also notable for its supportive attitude toward  the "Kurdish people" and an "independent Kurdish state." The  former is mentioned as a group that "is subjected to massive  brutality by Turkey," and the latter is given the same weight as  western Armenia: "This government must resolve the issue of  independence peacefully, in conjunction with the issue of  creating an independent Kurdish state." Can these propositions  be explained by compassion or a sense of justice toward an  oppressed people? There is also a question of timing: Why does  such an appeal come at a time when the Turkish press does  everything possible to gain credibility for its charges of  collaboration between Armenians and Kurds?    The list of such questions can grow much longer, and they  can  only cause more concern. One of the most important of such  questions, however, concerns the propriety and responsibility of  the press. How can a newspaper that bills itself as the press  organ of a political organization undertake such dangerous  steps? [passage omitted]</p>

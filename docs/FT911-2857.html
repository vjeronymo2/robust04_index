			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / International Company News: Mondadori factions close to agreement on break-up Mr CARLO De Benedetti and Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the two warring Italian businessmen, were last night on the brink of an agreement to divide Mondadori, the country's leading media group with a turnover in 1990 of L2,400bn (Dollars 1.9bn). Barring last-minute hitches, the settlement will end one of Italy's longest-running corporate battles, and one which has also had far-reaching political overtones given the importance of Mondadori's media interests. It gives Cir, Mr De Benedetti's holding company, control of La Repubblica, Italy's biggest-selling newspaper, and L'Espresso, the country's second biggest weekly news magazine. The De Benedetti faction is also expected to gain Mondadori's chain of regional newspapers, as well as majority ownership of Cartiere Ascoli, a big Mondadori-owned paper maker. For his part, Mr Berlusconi will receive Mondadori's traditional publishing interests, including most of its magazine activities, such as Panorama, Italy's most popular news magazine. The two men will take joint ownership of Manzoni, Mondadori's advertising and media-buying subsidiary. As part of the agreement, Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest company will receive a payment of around L170bn from Mr De Benedetti. The agreement is broadly along the lines of the division of the company discussed, but never finalised, in abortive talks between the two sides last summer. The deal ends months of uncertainty during which Mr De Benedetti lost, regained, and then once again lost control of the group, amid court decisions and boardroom shifts which analysts believed were heavily influenced by political considerations. However, as the pendulum swung first one way and then the other, it became increasingly clear that the ultimate loser was Mondadori itself. Although once one of Italy's most profitable publishing and media groups, the company barely broke even last year.</p>

			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JERRY HULSE'S TRAVEL TIPS  </P> <P> Susanne Lakin and her musician husband Lee Miller are opening a Cape Cod-style  B&amp;B on the ocean at Trinidad (about 50 miles below the Oregon border). This  is noteworthy for a couple of reasons. First, because this is a newly built  B&amp;B. Second, the couple will be catering particularly to families with  rates that'll be hard to beat: $75/$90 double, $5 extra for children up to age  16. Singles: $65/$80. The 5,000-square-foot home features ocean-view rooms,  lofts for youngsters, a Jacuzzi. There's a children's play area with farm  animals. Child care will be provided in the evening while parents dine out.  Susanne and Lee came up with the idea for their B&amp;B "out of frustration  with not being able to enjoy a B&amp;B while traveling with our own children."  To get a fix on Trinidad, it's 22 miles north of Eureka, a short drive from the  Arcata-Eureka Airport and only minutes from the redwoods. Guests will awaken to  the barking of sea lions, home-baked breads, muffins, smoked salmon and quiches  made with farm-fresh eggs and vegetables. At the sunset hour the hosts will  serve cappuccino, wine, home-baked pastries.  </P> <P> Susanne Lakin and Lee Miller, The Lost Whale, 3452 Patrick's Point Drive,  Trinidad, Calif. 95570. Telephone (707) 677-3425. Note: The inn opens May 1.  Current number: (707) 677-3827.  </P> <P> Sonoma Valley Inns  </P> <P> Ira and Irene Greenspan of San Bernardino ask for recommendations for inns in  Northern California's Sonoma Valley. We like Madrona Manor, a Victorian mansion  (circa 1881) that rises on eight wooded acres outside Healdsburg. Twenty rooms,  some with fireplaces. A swimming pool and an award-winning restaurant. Rates:  $92.50/$135 double, including a full breakfast. In town try the Healdsburg Inn  On The Plaza. Rooms with private baths, loads of antiques. Overlooks the town  square. Rates: $65/$85 midweek, $85/$115 weekends (full breakfast).  </P> <P> Madrona Manor, 1001 Westside Road, Healdsburg, Calif. 95448.

July/August are nearly fully booked. Plenty of space  still available for spring/fall months.

Telephone (714)  723-4340.  </P> <P> England's Prettiest Village  </P> <P> Castle Combe has been described as England's prettiest village. Only 10 miles  from Bath. It's the perfect spot for touring the Cotswolds, Stonehenge, Oxford,  Winchester. (Hollywood chose Castle Combe for the home of "Dr. Doolittle".) Now  you can vacation in the village's oldest home, the Old Courthouse, built in the  early 1400s. Timbered, exposed oak beams, a winding staircase that leads to  three upstairs bedrooms (one with an open fireplace, a four-poster bed). Ideal  for three couples. Rents for $2,000 a week. Reduced rates between  October/March. The Old Courthouse is one of the most photographed homes in  Britain. Other cottages with gabled roofs line Water Lane.  </P> <P> Brochures from Jim Farmer, 120 Duane St., New York 10007.  </P> <P> London Discount  </P> <P> London's Academy Hotel is offering price reductions for weekend guests.

My bid goes to Lamothe House, an 18th-Century mansion  immersed in early New Orleans atmosphere. Crowded with antiques. Gilt-edged  mirrors, candelabra, one-time gas-burning chandeliers. Coffee served from a  200-year-old Sheffield urn. A Victorian clock ticks away the hours. This  three-story mansion is in a peaceful neighborhood at the far end of the French  Quarter.

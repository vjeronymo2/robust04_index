			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Information Minister Dr. Jawad al-'Anani by </F> Nasir 'Arif in Amman; date not given]    [Text] ['Arif] Coordination among the Arab countries on all  issues is of utmost importance at the present stage,  particularly among the parties involved in the peace process.  How do you assess such coordination at the present time?    [Al-'Anani] First of all, we would like to say that Jordan  neither opposes nor does it obstruct. It has always emphasized  the need for Arab coordination. Jordan also admits that such  coordination should be at a high level among the Arab parties  that are involved in the peace negotiations.    We in Jordan do not insist on how to carry out such  coordination. It is irrelevant whether the Arab foreign  ministers meet on the sidelines of the Arab League meeting, or  hold a specific meeting for this purpose in Cairo, Damascus, or  Amman. What is important is that such a meeting takes place and  tackles all the issues that should be discussed. Otherwise,  there will be an impression that there are conflicting interests  among the negotiating countries, and this should absolutely not  occur.    From this premise, and out of its awareness of the  importance  of this issue Jordan states its viewpoints on the stands of the  negotiating parties and sometimes criticizes the Palestinian  negotiating stands as such stands directly harm or affect  Jordan's interests. However, Jordan does not reject  coordination but insists on it, whether on the bilateral of  multilateral level. This should be given top priority.  Otherwise, the alternative will not produce good results for  the entire Arab nation.    ['Arif] Some Arab parties which participate in the  negotiations say that the PLO has removed itself from the  framework of Arab coordination by signing the Oslo agreement.  Does Jordan hold a similar view?    [Al-'Anani] We in Jordan do not believe the conclusion of  the Oslo agreement is a departure from Arab ranks. This is  because we began negotiations in Madrid and later in Washington  with the knowledge that the PLO was negotiating on the  transitional phase while the other Arab countries were  negotiating for a final solution. In other words, only the PLO  from among the Arab delegations participating in the  negotiations had two stages; a transitional stage and a final  stage.    I believe Syria's protest revolved around the fact that the  PLO did not coordinate with the other Arab parties participating  in the negotiations. Some frankly say that had there not been  secret negotiations, results would not bave been achieved.  Others say that these results were not satisfactory because  there was no Arab coordination.    I conclude by saying that every negotiating party has its  own  interpretation and assessment. However, in the final analysis  we do not believe that by signing the Oslo agreement, the PLO  has violated the conditions of Arab coordination. What we view  as an infringement is the PLO's withholding any dealings with  the other Arab parties while it was discussing this agreement  with the Israelis.    Let me say this frankly. Arab coordination requires a large  amount of tolerance and forgiveness to enable the negotiating  Arab parties to bring pressure to bear on those who depart from  Arab ranks to have them rejoin these ranks. If we adopt a  rejectionist stand toward it, it will make it persist on its  lone course.    ['Arif] There were conflicting reports about the results of  the recent visit by the PLO's representative to Jordan. How  true is this?    [Al-'Anani] Mr. Hakam Bal'awi did not intend to achieve  results during his recent visit. He came to explain the  Palestinian stand on Resolution 904 and to brief Jordan on the  negotiations that are taking place between the PLO and Israel in  Cairo.    Mr. Bal'awi explained in detail the PLO's stand on this  resolution. Jordan had insisted on the need for coordination  before, during, and after the incident. The PLO representative  understood the message very well and he will communicate it to  the Palestinian command.    ['Arif] We have heard that the Kuwaiti Government has  proposed reestablishing relations with Jordan in return for the  Jordanian Government's recognition of the recent demarcation of  the Iraq-Kuwait border. How true is this?    [Al-'Anani] This is absolutely not true. However, Jordan's  hand is open for anyone who wants to reestablish ties with it  without preconditions and based on noninterference in internal  affairs.    If Jordan was convinced that the border demarcation between  Iraq and Kuwait is the acceptable thing that the two countries  have agreed upon, then we cannot but support this. However, it  is not right to say that we are for or against, without having  clear information about this issue.    In this context, let me say that Kuwait is in need of  reestablishing ties with Jordan, just as Jordan is in need of  reestablishing ties with Kuwait. Therefore, if the Kuwaiti  officials think it is in the interest of their country to  reestablish ties with Jordan, then we welcome them as brothers  on the basis of mutual respect and each party's free adoption of  whatever positions it deems appropriate on Arab issues.    ['Arif] How do you assess the meeting of the Arab foreign  ministers held recently on the sidelines of the Arab League  meeting?    [Al-'Anani] First of all, we have to bear in mind that the  Arab atmosphere amid which this meeting was held was not good.  There are Arab disagreements which I need not recount. The Arab  states have failed to agree on some difficult issues which are  difficult to agree on even when Arab states are in perfect  accord. To agree on those issues at present will be much more  difficult, especially amending the Arab League charter. This  issue was discussed before the Gulf war, which split Arab ranks.    Despite all of this, we should develop the Arab League's  bylaws to enable it to play its true role in the right manner  and to serve as a mechanism of Arab support for the United  Nations.    ['Arif] What about relations with the Gulf states?    [Al-'Anani] One cannot clap with one hand. Enhancing  relations with the Gulf states should be mutual. If we examine  Jordan's present circumstances and the circumstances of the Gulf  states, we will see that the two parties need each other and  that no one will be doing the other a favor in this respect.    Here, I should say that Arab relations in general between  the  states that export manpower and the states that had a surplus of  cash should no longer depend on the oil aspect alone. It should  be based on other dimensions.    In this context, it must be said that Jordan is not only a  country that has extra manpower to export to the Gulf states.  Also, the Gulf is not only a region that has a surplus of cash  to give to Jordan in the form of aid or soft loans. The  question is much more complex. There are strategic interests  for all of us, primarily defending the Arab nation and its  resources. There is also the question of peace and its  requirements, whether we reach peace agreements or not.    Jordan is not an inferior country. It has an equal status to  any other fraternal Arab country. In this context, we value and  appreciate Qatari and Omani relations with Jordan, as well as  the progress in relations with the United Arab Emirates. We  hope there will be concord with the rest of the Gulf states  because we both have mutual interests in promoting bilateral  ties.    ['Arif] The statements issued by the U.S. Administration in  the wake of Jordan's protest against the al-'Aqaba embargo  created the impression that there will be negotiations to  resolve this issue. Has the Jordanian Government received  anything from the United States to this effect?    [Al-'Anani] First of all, we have to say that negotiations  over this issue have been going on for a long time. So they are  not new. Jordan has constantly been protesting the ship  searches. However, the recent ship incident was the straw that  broke the camel's back. Hence, Jordan's strong position and  reaction because the question has now infringed on its  sovereignty and dignity.    We play our role in the peace process out of full  conviction that, first, a just, honorable, and lasting peace is  important and, second, Jordan's role in this process is also  important. We do not want anyone to think that our belief in  these issues mortgages us to them in a way that entitles them to  encroach on the homeland's dignity and safety.    Jordan will adopt an appropriate position on the U.S. stand.  There were positive reactions by the U.S. Administration after  this issue was protested. This administration, however, has not  committed itself to specific dates. We hope this issue will be  resolved quickly; otherwise, Jordan will take whatever measures  it deems appropriate to express its dissatisfaction.    ['Arif] It is known that the siege on al-'Aqabah was imposed  four years ago, and that it caused grave losses to the Jordanian  economy. Why was this issue raised only recently and in this  manner?    [Al-'Anani] This issue was raised many times in the past.  Time, reaction, and the means of expression depend on the  state's assessment of circumstances. Over time, His Majesty  King Husayn has proved that he knows very well when to say what  should be said and when to take a position. The fact that the  reaction to this issue has been great at a specific moment does  not mean that the event occurred all of a sudden; this reaction  was preceded by other methods. For example, if, under certain  circumstances, you express your dissatisfaction with something  and demand reversing what you believe is injustice done to you,  then you resort to various means and you should try various  methods. If these methods prove useless, you will then make an  appropriate decision. Hence, when the siege reached this limit,  Jordan protested, and his majesty spoke to the U.S. president  and the U.S. secretary of state, who both promised to study the  Jordanian proposals. We said this would take time. However,  when we noted that the [search] measures were escalated, rather  than alleviated, we knew that this constituted an indirect reply  by the U.S. Administration to our position. Thus, our reaction  had to be very clear and unequivocal toward the U.S.  Administration.    ['Arif] To what extent can Jordan continue to link the  lifting of the siege on al-'Aqabah to the return to the peace  negotiations?    [Al-'Anani] I do not like to discuss this issue at present.  Important alternatives are being studied. I, however, do not  want to divulge or talk about these alternatives at present.    ['Arif] The World Bank and the IMF make it conditional for  Jordan to adopt certain economic policies in exchange for loans.  Will Jordan respond to these terms?    [Al-'Anani] This is a political question. Regrettably, I  believe that many economic measures adopted by the Government  are analyzed by many critics, who lack information, as being  imposed or not imposed by the IMF. Here, I would like to say  frankly that this is not a scientific way of assessing matters.  A scientific approach is to view the law from the viewpoint of  whether or not it serves the country's interest. It is not true  that something was imposed on us. Naturally, a state with  approximately seven billion [currency not specified]  indebtedness to the IMF would set more terms than other states.  Here, let me honestly say that we ourselves should have  implemented many policies which the IMF had requested us to  implement.    Moreover, it should be emphasized that all matters agreed by  Jordan, the IMF, and the World Bank were thoroughly discussed  before being approved or accepted. I thus do not believe that  matters go the way some believe. We are not "lying" on the  ground and yielding to IMF terms. On the contrary, and as I  said, we only agree with the World Bank and the IMF on any  matter after a lengthy discussion. Regarding the talk that we  should discard and ignore the IMF and the World Bank as if they  do not exist, we frankly say that we cannot do so.    ['Arif] Jordan was to host an international economic  conference. What happened to this conference?    [Al-'Anani] There are endless ideas in this regard. Some of  us are surprised when we read a story or a study about this  issue. As a matter of fact, there are many studies in all  advanced nations about the future plans of the Middle East. We  will only do what we think is in our interest. The idea of the  conference was originally put forward by Israeli Foreign  Minister Shim'on Peres. He tried to present and crystallize  this idea. We do not think, however, that the time is right for  this. Not only this. We do not have answers to give investors  when they come to Jordan. Therefore, making this idea a reality  is not possible at this time.    ['Arif] In light of the democratic and world changes and the  requirements [istihqaqat] imposed by the peace process, what is  the new strategy of the Jordanian media?    [Al-'Anani] I do not know what this phrase means. This  phrase has been frequently used recently. I wish someone could  tell me what it means. I will tell you, however, about the role  of the media in the current phase. The media should serve the  state and achieve its interests. It should air different views  and tell the public the truth about what is happening and the  various views regarding what is happening. In any country,  people differ over major issues, either against the background  of ideological differences, because they have conflicting  interests, or for political and party reasons. The media should  reflect world public opinion and public opinion in the homeland  and help the homeland make decisions.    Second, it is the duty of the media to develop its means and  capabilities, since we are not living alone. Jordan has a  central geographic location and is open to all channels.    ['Arif] His Majesty King Husayn has recently criticized the  official media characterizing it as "absent and lost." What  measures will be taken to correct this situation?    [Al-'Anani] His majesty's position on the media is not new.  He has said this several times in the past. I fully support  this assessment and understand the higher national and positive  motives that made his majesty criticize the media. This  criticism places the Information Ministry and the officials  before their true responsibilities. There will be a  comprehensive media plan which we will carry out as soon as  possible.    ['Arif] There are rumors about changes in the media leaders  in the coming days. How true is this?    [Al-'Anani] No comment.    ['Arif] Jordanian journalists accuse the Information  Ministry of facilitating the mission of foreign journalists  without providing the same facilities to them. How do you reply?    [Al-'Anani] Personally, I do not think so.    ['Arif] Much has been said about a plan to turn the Radio  and Television Corporation into an independent entity. When  will this happen?    [Al-'Anani] I want to say one thing. We have an entity  named the Radio and Television Corporation, but this entity has  no bylaws or board. This is what we plan to do at present.    ['Arif] Amnesty International has criticized the Jordanian  Press and Publications Law, saying it contradicts human rights  and freedom of expression. How do you reply?    [Al-'Anani] We reject this because this law is the outcome  of a constitutional, legal process and it was endorsed by the  parliament. It is, in fact, much more advanced than previous  laws. As for some restrictions in the law, these are in harmony  with the Jordanian climate and positions.    The long and short of it is that we do not need anyone to  tell us that the Press and Publications Law agrees with or  contradicts human rights and freedom of expression because laws  are judged by the way they are implemented.</p>

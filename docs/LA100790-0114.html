			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICA'S HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM NEEDS FIXING, BUT APING CANADA WILL MAKE THINGS  WORSE  </P> <P> Leslie Berkman's story, "U.S. Hospitals Open Doors to Canada's Addicts" (Sept.  23), serves as a preview to all who would like to see our country adopt a  similar system of socialized medicine. Except that, unlike the present-day  Canadians, we shall have nowhere else to go!  </P> <P> Berkman should point out that the three- to four-month wait is not confined to  drug addiction treatment. Canadians needing a coronary bypass, and likely other  life-saving procedures, face a similar fate. Many, in fact, vote with their  feet by flocking across the border for medical care.  </P> <P> Our health-care delivery system is by no means perfect. We do need some sort of  coverage that provides basic health care for all. This might be financed partly  by employees and partly by employers. We should also force businesses dealing  with products that constitute significant health hazards to bear the  consequences for their actions.  </P> <P> Why shouldn't we levy a health tax on tobacco, alcohol and polluters to help  pay for some of the health problems they have created?  </P> <P> While the federal government's tilt toward a health maintenance organization  type of system is ill-advised, some sort of controls on escalating costs should  be considered.  </P> <P> Coverage for extraordinary medical procedures, for example, may require a large  deductible and extra premiums by employees. The revised schedule for medical  reimbursement by Medicare may be a step in the right direction but will require  careful evaluation before it is universally applied.  </P> <P> JOHN T. CHIU, M.D.  </P> <P> Corona del Mar  </P></p>

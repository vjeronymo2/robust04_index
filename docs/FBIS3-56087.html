			<p>Language: <F P=105> Tajik </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A letter by Imamali Rakhmanov, the head of state, to  the UN secretary general is at the center of attention of  workers.    In my opinion, the concern of Imamali Rahkmanov, the head of  state, which is described in his letter is clear to everyone,  said Shukur Zuhurov, the minister of labor and employment, in  his interview to a KHOVAR news agency correspondent.    According to our available information more than 30,000 of  our compatriots who have had to flee their places of residence  are in the territories of neighboring Afghanistan. It should be  said that the present situation in Afghanistan is very  complicated. The armed clashes between the different political  forces are continuing here. These clashes are taking place in  those areas where the Tajik refugees live. That is why their  situation is very difficult.    In addition to this, the situation on the Tajik-Afghan  border  is not calm. Is it possible to return home in such a situation?  That is why I think that Imamali Rakhmanov has sent the letter  to the UN secretary general at the right time. The authority of  the United Nations is high all over the world. And we hope that  thanks to the active assistance of this organization the  bloodshed will be stopped in Afghanistan and the return of the  Tajik refugees will be possible.</p>

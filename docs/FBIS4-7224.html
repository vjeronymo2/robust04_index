			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh AKP April 26 -- Son Sen, a member of the  Democratic Kampuchea (Khmer Rouge) is now reportedly the new  power in the Khmer Rouge, said CAMBODIA TIMES, an  English-language local newspaper, in its recent issue.    Contrary to common belief and reports, Son Sen, who was  relieved of his duties in May 1992 after losing a high-level  dispute over whether the Khmer Rouge should pull out of the  UN-organized peace plan, is very much in control within the  Khmer Rouge.    According to senior government intelligence sources, Son Sen  is in control of the Khmer Rouge rank and file and its political  platform.    He is also said to be directing the military effort against  the currently victorious Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF).    The source said that Son Sen is now directing the  counter-attacks against the RCAF forces at Pailin from a  stronghold at Phum Malai mountains, one of the last remaining  Khmer Rouge military bastions.    He is also reportedly responsible for the Khmer Rouge's  successful counter-attack at Anlung Veng.    They said that the fact that Khmer Rouge leaders like Pol  Pot  and Khieu Samphan and commanders like Ta Mok were reportedly no  longer in the country but have sought sanctuary in a  neighbouring country, has fuelled claims that the Khmer Rouge  leadership is now in quiet disarray with the military losses,  especially that of Pailin.    Meanwhile, Pailin has reportedly come under heavy shelling  in  recent days and the Khmer Rouge were said to be operating in  groups of not more than eight members who were involved in  hit-and-run tactics as well as harassment of RCAF personnel and  commanders.    Military sources said that the capture of Phnum Malai from  the Khmer Rouge was the best way of ensuring peace, Pailin and  Battambang as it will relieve Khmer Rouge pressure from these  two areas.</p>

			<p>940106 FT  06 JAN 94 / Major reshuffles team after Yeo's resignation Mr John Major, the prime minister, was forced into an unplanned government reshuffle yesterday after Mr Tim Yeo, the environment minister, resigned over an extramarital affair. Mr Yeo's job as one of three deputies to Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, went to Mr Robert Atkins. Mr Atkins moves sideways from the minister of state's job in the Northern Ireland office. He will be replaced by Mr Michael Ancram, the junior Northern Ireland minister, who has co-ordinated talks between the government and Ulster's non-violent political parties. Downing Street said Mr Ancram would retain responsibility for the talks to avoid a hiatus in the Northern Ireland peace process. Mr Tim Smith, the MP for Beaconsfield, will take over Mr Ancram's less sensitive responsibilities for economic policy. Mr Yeo's resignation was announced less than 24 hours after he declared that he would not be driven out of office by media attacks on his behaviour. He changed his mind after the executive of his South Suffolk constituency association formally criticised his affair with a Conservative councillor who had a child by him last year. The association stopped short of seeking Mr Yeo's resignation, but urged him to reflect on 'widespread disappointment' expressed by local party members. The statement echoed claims by senior Conservative backbenchers that Mr Yeo's behaviour conflicted with the government's 'back to basics' campaign, which emphasises traditional values. Downing Street sought to limit the political damage by distancing Mr Major from calls by cabinet colleagues for a reduction in the number of single mothers. But the affair is deeply embarrassing to Mr Major, who was aware of Mr Yeo's relationship before it was disclosed in the media last month. The prime minister refrained from giving open support to Mr Yeo, but his decision not to seek the minister's resignation was criticised by some Conservative backbenchers. In his resignation letter, Mr Yeo said his personal life 'has never in any way prevented me from discharging my duties as a minister'. However, he said he believed he had no option other than to step down 'to concentrate on uniting my constituency party organisation'. Mr Yeo said yesterday he was 'sad' to leave the government. In his reply, Mr Major said that Mr Yeo had been 'a most effective minister'. The prime minister said he was 'sorry' that Mr Yeo's talents would not be available to the government. Mr Major also said that he hoped Mr Yeo's talents 'may be used again at a future stage', raising the prospect that he may return to the government after a period on the back benches. The prime minister's decision to limit the reshuffle to three ministers confirms that a wider ministerial shake-up is likely in the summer. Mr Atkins, a friend of Mr Major, is a former sports minister who shares the prime minister's enthusiasm for cricket. He has previous experience of the Environment Department, which will ease the transition. Affair raises questions for party of family values Page 7 Editorial Comment and Observer Page 13</p>

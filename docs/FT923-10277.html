			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / International Company News: Time Warner in talks with potential partners TIME Warner is once more rumoured to be advancing in its talks with potential foreign partners as the US media and entertainment group continues to try to whittle down its substantial debt burden. A number of possible investors are being bandied about Wall Street including Mr Paul Desmarais, chairman of Canada's Power Corp, Mr Albert Frere, chairman of Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, and Switzerland's Pargesa. Although Time Warner has had some success in its quest for so-called 'strategic' partners, most notably its Time Warner Entertainment (TWE) joint venture with Japan's Toshiba and C. Itoh, overall its progress has been slow. Some potential investors have been deterred by Time Warner's policy of maintaining management control of its investment vehicles. At TWE, for example, Toshiba and C Itoh invested Dollars 1bn for a 12.5 per cent stake, leaving Time Warner with control of the subsidiary. In May, poor investor interest forced Time Warner to cut the size of a private placement of long-term notes to Dollars 850m from Dollars 1bn. Recent speculation has not helped its share price, which held steady at Dollars 107 1/4 at mid-session yesterday. It slipped Dollars 1 1/8 the previous day in a soaring stock market.</p>

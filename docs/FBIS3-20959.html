			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by P.O.: "The Train Changes Track Gauge </F> Automatically"]    [Text] Talgo SA of Madrid, Spain, will develop a system in  cooperation with the Japanese steel producer and mechanical  engineering firm Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd., Osaka, which  will allow railroad cars automatically to change the track width  of the wheelsets. There is a simple reason for Sumitomo's  particular interest in further development of the Spanish  technique.    Since the Japanese railways were split up and privatized in  1987, competition between the railroad companies has increased a  great deal. The declared goal of numerous railroad enterprises  is to attract more passengers with a higher level of comfort.  Since with the traditionally overfilled Japanese trains it will  hardly be possible to improve the comfort of the cars  themselves, the railroad companies are primarily intent on  eliminating the need for many transfers. In numerous cases,  however, this is only possible if at certain points the trains  can change their track gauge rapidly.    The Spanish Talgo system originated out of the necessity of  changing tracks for foreign trains when transferring to the  broader Spanish gauge. In order to do so, the train runs at slow  speed over a 15-meter-long gauge conversion track. In addition  to the normal rails, additional rails have here been mounted on  both sides. The railroad car also has so-called yoke elements  mounted on the wheels, also on both sides.    The yoke elements are lowered at the rail section parallel  with the actual track. In so doing they lift the train slightly.  This leaves the wheels free for a brief moment. At this moment  the guide rails press the wheels into the new position--that is  to say either onto the narrower or, in the opposite direction,  onto the broader track.    Sumitomo and Talgo now want jointly to improve this  technique  and, according to their own information, initially aim  particularly for the Japanese market, where in this respect  demand is extremely intense. In Japan a truck with four wheels  dominates, while in Spain there are two-wheel elements. Further,  in Japan on countless trains the wheels of the trucks of  individual cars are directly driven, while in Spain the trains  are almost exclusively pulled or pushed by separate locomotives.    Consequently, trucks and driving wheels must now be  developed--based on the Talgo system described--which can be  similarly automatically adapted. The prototypes of powered,  convertible trucks are to be ready for testing during the course  of 1995.</p>

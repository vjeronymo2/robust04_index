			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> KOHL CRITICIZES OPPONENTS OF REUNIFICATION  </P> <P> Chancellor Helmut Kohl today criticized people who say there is little chance  the two Germanys will reunite, an apparent response to Mikhail S. Gorbachev's  comments on the subject.  </P> <P> "He who does not want to make decisions for our people should not try to  persuade them the best thing is a division of our fatherland," Kohl said in his  first speech to Parliament regarding East Germany's historic border openings.  </P> <P> Reunification has become an increasingly important topic following the growing  unrest in Communist East Germany that led to the new government of President  Egon Krenz and the decision to open the nation's borders.  </P> <P> The Soviet president on Wednesday said talk about reunification "would mean  interference in the affairs" of East Germany and West Germany.  </P> <P> But Kohl, who did not mention Gorbachev, said East Germans "must be able to  decide for themselves, which path they want to follow in the future."  </P> <P> Kohl said West Germany would "respect every decision made by the people of the  German Democratic Republic (East Germany) in free self-determination."  </P> <P> The chancellor claimed socialism is a "total failure." A day earlier, Gorbachev  insisted the Communist revolution "was not a mistake."  </P></p>

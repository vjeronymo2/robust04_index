			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Arts: A finely tuned 'Wozzeck' - Opera North's first production of Berg's masterpiece THE LAST new production of the 1992-93 Opera North season at Leeds is also the last under the departing general administrator, Nicholas Payne. The work is Berg's Wozzeck, of which Payne writes feelingly in the programme - 'I suppose that I love Wozzeck as much as any opera' - and of which, happily but by no means fortuitously, his company now offers an outstanding presentation. It bears, indeed, the marks of a performance put together with loving care: meticulously prepared orchestral and choral contributions, a production finely attuned to the spirit of the opera and finely tuned by almost all its participants. The results, as shown on Thursday, reveal qualities of the highest appropriateness to Berg's opera - theatrical immediacy born of economical, forceful statement, musical and dramatic; emotional power searing without the faintest trace of melodramatic excess or self-consciousness; a fierce, uninflated truthfulness of characterisation. The show possesses above all the rare merit of allowing the music to dominate the experience, of baring to the audience Berg's unequalled combination of intricate workmanship and animal directness of expression, while at the same time never neglecting the revolutionary inventiveness of his total theatrical vision, his foreshortening of emotional time and space. Done this way, in a small, intimate theatre, and in English - a new translation by Richard Stokes, convincingly colloquial if also at times bluntly worded - Opera North's Wozzeck proves one of the most completely absorbing and compelling I have heard and seen. Much advance publicity was generated by the operatic debut of Deborah Warner, the celebrated theatre director. For a change the ballyhoo was justified. The naked intensity, austerely arresting control of stage space and tautly over-arching line of thought which rendered, say, the Warner Electra at the London Riverside Studios such a shattering experience have been re-invented in the operatic medium with no evident loss or dilution. Flat-planed designs by Hildegard Bechtler, hard yet luminous, characteristically atmospheric in their painterly manipulation of colour, allow Berg's pattern of scene and interlude to form and dissolve with unshowy deftness - the swish of a diaphanous black front curtain, the sideways slide of panels and bleak props, and the 'psychological' lighting of Jean Kalman are all functional and at the same time crucially poetic properties. Apt tribute seems to be paid to the original 1925 Berlin Wozzeck designer, Caspar Neher (also Covent Garden's in 1952). The 'extremeness' of the opera's situations and moods is here balanced by an acutely disciplined acting style - sited within the bounds of naturalness yet shaded and heightened by expressionist intensity. Vivian Tierney, a Marie of quite wonderfully unaffected pathos, unadorned physicality and (except in the highest notes) lyrical fullness of voice, is perhaps its most immediately affecting exemplar; but Andrew Shore's Wozzeck (the shaking inner torment depicted in small, precise detail), Jeffrey Lawton's rubicund, self-satisfied windbag of a Captain and Alan Woodrow's small, musclebound Drum Major stand no less proud at the head of a cast almost all musically strong and untainted by exaggeration or cartoon grotesquerie. Violence, when it comes, is horribly well-plotted (Marie's blood streaks the floor); Mark Curtis's Idiot haunts the proceedings like a blood relation of Pierrot Lunaire. Paul Daniel conducts the English Northern Philharmonia in a manner and style exactly matched to the production - Wednesday's performance was one of those treasurable operatic occasions in which it became increasingly hard to distinguish between the activities of stage and pit. At this stage the conductor's innate honesty of approach does not allow him to relish as fully as some have done the 'Viennese' elements in Berg's musical idiom, the portamento phrasing and sickly-sensuous waltz rhythms and drenched string textures underpinning Marie's Bible reading and the D-minor Interlude. That may come. Already Mr Daniel and his orchestra and chorus provide so assured a command of the score that the good fortune of Leeds audiences in having as their first Wozzeck this admirably rounded realisation is hardly to be believed. The production is supported by Friends of Opera North; in repertory at the Grand, Leeds until May 21, then on tour in Manchester, Nottingham, Hull and Sheffield</p>

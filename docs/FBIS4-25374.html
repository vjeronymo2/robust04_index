			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special interview" by staff reporters Yin Shuguang (1438 </F> 2885 1639) and Lu Yansong (0712 1484 2646): "There Are Bright  Prospects for Sino-Russian Cooperation--Interviewing Russian  Ambassador to China Igor Rogachev"]    [Text] Beijing, 2 June (RENMIN RIBAO)--After the end of  the visit to China by Chernomyrdin, prime minister of the  Russian Federal Government, this morning, Mr Igor Rogachev,  Russian ambassador to China, was interviewed by RENMIN RIBAO  reporters, answering our questions about the current  Russian-Chinese relationship.    [Reporter] Mr Ambassador, what comments would you like to  make about Prime Minister Chernomyrdin's visit to China?    [Rogachev] The visit achieved substantial results and was  constructive. The two countries signed seven agreements with  extensive content. This further strengthened the legal  foundation for the friendly cooperation between the two  countries, and was a giant step forward in our bilateral  relations. I deeply appreciate President Jiang Zemin's opinion  on the need to have foresight in Russian-Chinese relations.  President Jiang Zemin will visit Russia in the autumn of this  year, and this will become another major milestone in the annals  of Russian-Chinese relations.    [Reporter] Recently, Chinese and Russian leaders both  stressed the need to face the 21st century and to consider and  handle bilateral relations from this high plain. The Russian  side also proposed the establishment of a "constructive  partnership" with China. Mr Ambassador, would you please  further explanation this?    [Rogachev] The proposal about the "constructive partnership"  was put forth by President Yeltsin early this year. Recently,  when meeting Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, President Jiang Zemin  said: China thought that the Russian proposal was close to the  five principles of peaceful coexistence China maintains for the  development of state-to-state relations. The Russian side also  agreed that the Chinese position coincided with with the Russian  conception about the "constructive partnership." By  "constructive partnership," we mean that as two great countries,  Russia and China are completely equal, and there is no such  thing as a "big brother" and a "little brother." Russia and  China are both big powers in the world and share the same  objectives of peace, security, and cooperation in international  affairs. We hope to build close cooperative relations with  China on the international stage and, first of all, in the  Asia-Pacific region. The "constructive partnership" between the  two countries should not harm the interests of any third country.    [Reporter] Mr Ambassador, in what ways do you think that Mr  Prime Minister's visit to China has promoted the further  development of Sino-Russian economic and trade relations?    [Rogachev] This time, the two countries signed a series of  economic agreements on preventing double taxation and tax  evasion. This will ensure the further development of economic  and trade cooperation between the two countries. In addition,  the joint committee of the two countries for economic, trade,  scientific and technological cooperation also formulated a  series of measures for resolving problems appearing in the  course of bilateral economic and trade cooperation.    [Reporter] Last year, the volume of bilateral trade between  China and Russia reached an all-time high, but it declined  somewhat in the first quarter of this year as compared with the  same period last year. How should this phenomenon be viewed?    [Rogachev] In my opinion, we should not exaggerate the  seriousness of this issue. This was related to the economic  conditions of the two countries. For example, the period of  barter trade has come to an end. The two sides have to  immediately take measures for the transition to a  better-organized form of trade based on cash settlement. Of  course, bilateral trade is also constrained by some other  factors. For example, the banking system is still rather weak,  and relevant laws and regulations have yet to be further  improved.    [Reporter] In your opinion, what measures should be adopted  in order to push Sino-Russian economic and trade cooperation to  a new stage?    [Rogachev] We hope that China will increase investment in  Russia, and the Russian side also plans to increase use of  China's labor resources to develop infrastructural facilities in  the Far East region. We shall also provide high and new  technologies for your country in energy and other fields.  Russian entrepreneurs hope to have the opportunity to  participate in the Three Gorges project and other major  construction projects in China. We have not yet made full use  of the advantageous geographical condition of two countries  which are adjacent to each other. The two governments should  create better conditions for economic and trade cooperation at  the border areas on both sides and should increase cooperation  in the field of production.    [Reporter] Mr Ambassador, would you please describe the  development prospects of Sino-Russian relations?    [Rogachev] Prime Minister Chernomyrdin said in Beijing that  the two countries should work out an intermediate and long-term  program for economic, trade, scientific, and technological  cooperation. China and the Soviet Union have signed documents  of this type in the past, but things have changed so greatly  that we should update such documents on the basis of giving  consideration to the wishes of Russia's Far East region and  China's Northeast region. I believe that our two countries will  make great developments and achievements in cooperation  extending beyond the 21st century.</p>

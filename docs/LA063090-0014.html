			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRACK AND FIELD;  </P> <P> POWELL (28-5) MAKES JUMP TOWARD THE TOP  </P> <P> Mike Powell soared 28 feet 5 inches to become the fifth-best long-jump  performer of all time, and Leroy Burrell ran to a 1990 world best of 9.96  seconds in the 100-meter dash Friday night, highlighting the BNP Grand Prix  track meet.  </P> <P> Two-time Olympic champion Roger Kingdom was beaten by Tony Dees in the  110-meter high hurdles. Dees clocked 13.24, Kingdom 13.29.  </P> <P> Greg Foster, coming off a three-month drug suspension, was third in 13.36.  </P> <P> In the long jump, Powell trails Bob Beamon, the world record-holder at 29-2  1/2, Soviet Robert Emmian (29-1), Carl Lewis (28-10 1/4), and Larry Myricks  (28-8 1/4), although Lewis and Myricks both have several marks better than  Powell's.  </P> <P> Powell, who had a previous best of 27-10 1/4, jumped 27-4 3/4 and 27-6 on his  two earlier attempts.  </P> <P> Emmian was second Friday at 26-11 3/4.  </P> <P> Burrell overcame France's Daniel Sangouma midway through the race and raised  his hand in victory over the final five meters. Still, Burrell's time was only  .04 of a second off the world record of 9.92 held by Lewis.  </P> <P> Burrell had the previous 1990 best of 10.01. He ran 9.94 last year and a  wind-aided 9.94 this year.  </P> <P> Sangouma, whose start was suspect when he jumped ahead of Burrell so quickly,  was timed in 10.02, a French record.  </P> <P> "Sangouma was well ahead of me (at the start)," Burrell said. "But rather than  worry about that, I said I'm going to catch him. That's exactly what happened.  And I was so happy, I put my hand up."  </P> <P> France's Monique Ewanje-Epee won the women's 100-meter high hurdles in 12.56  for a 1990 world best and a French record.  </P> <P> Romanian Dointe Melinte won the women's 1,500 meters in 3:58.69, another  season's best.  </P> <P> Another women's 1990 best was bettered when Merlene Ottey of Jamaica won the  200 in 21.97. She had run 22.12 earlier this season.  </P> <P> In the men's 200, Michael Johnson of the United States, making his European  debut, won in 20.01. Johnson ran a season's best of 19.90 at the U.S.  championships this month.  </P> <P> In other events, Americans won the men's 1,500 meters and women's 3,000.  </P> <P> Joe Falcon rallied in the stretch to take the 1,500 in 3:36.60, and PattiSue  Plummer outdueled women's world cross-country champion Lynn Jennings in the  3,000, 8:44.00 to 8:46.08.  </P> <P> Of his hurdles victory, Dees said he can run faster. "I was pressing at the  end," he said. "I should have never let Roger get that close."  </P> <P> Kingdom arrived late after competing Thursday night at Verona, Italy.  </P> <P> "The meet didn't end until midnight and we didn't get here until 5:30 in the  morning," Kingdom said.  </P> <P> Dees started the year with a personal best of 13.54, and has improved to  sixth-best American.  </P></p>

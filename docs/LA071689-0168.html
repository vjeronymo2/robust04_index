			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOT IMPROVEMENTS VARY CITY TO CITY  </P> <P> An interesting result of a survey of home improvements conducted by Practical  Homeowner magazine was the variance in the choice of people in different cities  around the country.  </P> <P> For instance, while an interior face lift was rated first in Atlanta, Dallas,  Cincinnati and Salt Lake City on the basis of how it might improve the value of  a house, it was far down the list in some other cities. In Seattle, it ranked  10th on a list of 10 such home improvements.  </P> <P> What ranked first in Seattle? The installation of skylights, not even mentioned  on other lists.  </P> <P> Exterior painting got the nod in Los Angeles, central air conditioning in  Philadelphia and a swinging glass patio door in San Francisco.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISABILITY FOR 2 POLICEMEN  </P> <P> The two Long Beach police officers who have received stress disability  retirements did not reach that point through their "own alleged misconduct."  </P> <P> Their psychological problems stemmed from the media portrayal of their actions.  They were vilified, humiliated, whipped, crucified, tried, convicted, and  sentenced -- and their trial hasn't started yet.  </P> <P> Do these officers really stand any chance of a fair trial?  </P> <P> I doubt that there is anyone in Southern California who hasn't seen and formed  an opinion about the carefully edited videotape that was heralded as truth by  the media, or failed to read any of the slanted editorials published after the  fact.  </P> <P> DOUG SHEPARD  </P> <P> Garden Grove  </P></p>

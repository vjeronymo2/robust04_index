Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 --> This action was commenced on June 15, 1994, when the United States filed a civil antitrust complaint under Section 15 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 25, alleging that the proposed acquisition of a 20% equity interest in MCI Communications Corporation (``MCI'') by British Telecommunications plc (``BT''), and the proposed formation of a joint venture between MCI and BT to provide international enhanced telecommunications services, would violate Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 18, by lessening competition in the markets for global seamless telecommunications services and for international telecommunications services between the United States and the United Kingdom. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the same date, the United States submitted a proposed Final Judgment, a Competitive Impact Statement, and a Stipulation signed by the defendants consenting to entry of the proposed Final Judgment. The proposed Final Judgment contains terms and conditions safeguarding against discriminatory and other anticompetitive practices that would favor the defendants over competing United States providers of international telecommunications services and harm competition. The Competitive Impact Statement explains the basis for the Complaint and the reasons why entry of the proposed Final Judgment would be in the public interest. In the Stipulation, defendants and the United States consent to entry of the proposed Final Judgment by the Court after completion of the procedures required by the APPA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

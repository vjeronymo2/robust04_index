			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.1555&blank;Control Markings <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposal would add to &sect;23.1555(e)(2) the requirement that no other control be red. This would help prevent use of a wrong control in an emergency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.1559&blank;Operating Limitations Placard <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposal would simplify the present &sect;23.1559 and delete duplicate material. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;23.1559(a), (b), and a new paragraph (c), would provide essentially the same information as the current rule. All airplanes currently operate with an AFM and the new rule places emphasis on using the AFM to define required operating limitations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.1563&blank;Airspeed Placards <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposal would add a new paragraph (c) to &sect;23.1563. The new paragraph would be applicable to WAT limited airplanes and would require providing the maximum V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> MC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in the takeoff configuration determined under &sect;23.149(b). This is desirable since the V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> MC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is not marked on the airspeed indicator for these airplanes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.1567&blank;Flight Maneuver Placard <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed new &sect;23.1567(d), which would be applicable to acrobatic and utility airplanes approved for intentional spinning, would require a placard listing control actions for recovery. Also, it would require a statement on the placard that the airplane be recovered when spiral characteristics occur, or after six turns, or at any greater number of turns for which certification tests have been conducted. This paragraph would replace the similar placard requirement in current &sect;23.1583(e)(3) for acrobatic category airplanes, and the placard requirement would be deleted from &sect;23.1583(e). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.1581&blank;General <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposal would make editorial changes in &sect;23.1581 and would recognize WAT limited and non-WAT limited airplanes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed new &sect;23.1581(a)(3) would require information necessary to comply with relevant operating rules. This is a FAR/JAR harmonization item and is considered necessary because some operational rules, such as &sect;135.391, require flight planning with one-engine-inoperative cruise speed and/or driftdown data. For airplanes operated under part 135 in the United States, it represents no change in requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;23.1581(b)(2) would require that only WAT limited airplane AFM's provide data necessary for determining WAT limits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed new &sect;23.1581(c) would require the AFM units to be the same as on the instruments. This requirement would enhance operational safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;23.1581(d) would delete the current requirement for a table of contents. This is considered to be a format requirement and not appropriate for this section, which specifies AFM content. Current &sect;23.1581(d) is being replaced by a requirement to present all operational airspeeds as indicated airspeeds. Although not currently required, this is current practice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.1583&blank;Operating Limitations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed revisions to &sect;23.1583 would make minor changes in the operating limitations information furnished in the AFM. These proposed changes include revising airspeed limitations for commuter category airplanes, requiring AFM limitations for WAT limited airplanes, furnishing ambient temperature limitations, furnishing smoking restriction information, and furnishing information specifying types of runway surfaces. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;23.1583(a)(3) would make the V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> MO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> /V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> MO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  airspeed operating limitations applicable only to turbine powered commuter category airplanes. This is consistent with current practice since no reciprocating engine-powered commuter category airplanes have been proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;23.1583(c)(3) would add takeoff and landing weight limitations for WAT limited airplanes. (See the &sect;23.45 proposal for discussion of WAT limited airplanes.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;23.1583(c)(4) and (5) renumber the present &sect;23.1583(c)(3) and (4). These proposed paragraphs are revised editorially and cross-references are updated. Proposed paragraph (c)(4)(ii) would impose a new requirement that the AFM include the maximum takeoff weight for each airport altitude and ambient temperature within the range selected by the applicant at which the accelerate-stop distance determined under &sect;23.55 is equal to the available runway length plus the length of any stopway, if available. This is currently required for transport category airplanes and is necessary for harmonization with the JAR. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

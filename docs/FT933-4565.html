			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Transfer Technology up 62% TRANSFER Technology, the West Midlands-based specialist engineer, yesterday said moves to reduce its dependence on the European motor industry had paved the way for a 61.5 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, writes Tim Burt. In the first half of 1993 turnover rose 33 per cent to Pounds 65m (Pounds 48.9m) and profits worked through at Pounds 5.6m (Pounds 3.5m). Mr Geoffrey Robinson, chairman, said a decline in operating profit of the automotive division - from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds 1.43m - was offset by strong exports and profitable acquisitions in the control and manufacturing technology sector. In the technology division operating profit rose from Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 3.64m, and substantial orders from China and the purchase of two specialist US companies would lead to further growth, he said. Mr Robinson said no further acquisitions or rights issues were planned. Instead the group would concentrate on organic growth. Predicting that the benefits of such growth will feed through in the second half, the company has declared a modest increase in the interim dividend to 6.5p (6.25p) but said the final would reflect the improved results. Earnings per share, after the rights issue to fund the acquisition of the Fenworth components group, rose to 22.3p (20.1p). There is to be an extraordinary meeting will consider a sub-division of the shares from 50p to 10p, and a change of name to TransTec.</p>

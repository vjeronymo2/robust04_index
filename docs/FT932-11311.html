			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: PM rejects oil tax criticisms MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday rejected criticism of the government's controversial proposals for reforming the North Sea tax regime, saying they would be good for jobs and good for Britain. The prime minister said the reform would improve development incentives. He was responding to criticism from Mr Robert Hughes, Labour MP for Aberdeen North, who said the changes would 'savagely attack' small companies in the drilling and exploration sector. Under the Budget proposals, the rate at which petroleum revenue tax is levied would fall from 75 per cent to 50 per cent and tax relief would be abolished for exploratory drilling.</p>

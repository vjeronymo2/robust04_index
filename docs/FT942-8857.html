			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / International Bonds: Uncertainty ahead of FOMC meeting keeps lid on issuance Uncertainty ahead of yesterday's key Federal Reserve meeting in US put the lid back on the eurobond market. Issuers who were expecting the Fed to announce a rise in interest rates were taking no chances and there was only a smattering of small offerings. The largest issue came from Bayerische Landesanstalt fur Aufbaufinanzierung, the state-owned Bavarian development bank. The LfA is borrowing DM200m via a five-year floating-rate note issue priced to yield five basis points below six-month D-Mark Libor. The issue, led by Trinkaus und Burkhardt, was the bank's first to include the state 'deficiency' guarantee. As a result, the notes were snapped up by domestic banks, which can use them as collateral in their dealings with the Bundesbank. Ecu paper was popular as retail investors continued to roll over their holdings. Dealers said around Ecu1.7bn was coming up for redemption every month. Credit Local de France, the triple-A rated French municipal financing agency, offered Ecu65m of four-year bonds fungible with an outstanding Ecu235m bond through lead manager Swiss Bank Corp. Later in the afternoon, GECC, the fund-raising arm of General Electric, made its second appearance in as many days when it raised Ecu100m fungible with a five-year Ecu100m issue launched in late March. There was little speculation of impending deals and the expectation of more yen-based supply was hardly satisfied by yesterday's offering from Hitachi Credit, which issued Y1.5bn via the Bank of Tokyo. Meanwhile, United Microelectronics Corp, a Taiwanese designer, producer and distributor of integrated circuits, announced it was issuing Dollars 160m of euroconvertible bonds to fund an increase in its production capacity. UK investment bank BZW, which is handling the launch, said the 10-year bond would have a coupon of between 1.25 per cent and 1.75 per cent. Final pricing takes place at the end of the week. Tube Investments' Indian arm issued Dollars 50m of new stock in the form of Global Depositary Receipts through S. G. Warburg and Cazenove. The 5.2m GDRs were priced at Dollars 8.77 and there was a 'green shoe' addition of just over 500,000 GDRs. The launch was scheduled to take place three weeks ago but was pulled after the failed flotation of VSNL, the Indian telephone company. Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, yesterday affirmed its AA+ rating on the Kingdom of Sweden's long-term foreign currency debt. It said the ratings were supported by a manageable external financial position and a solid balance of payments performance.</p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Letter: Paradox of Ukraine and membership of the nuclear club Sir, Monday's Financial Times presented an interesting paradox. Your article, 'Regional jostling ties up Yeltsin assembly', and your editorial, 'Mr Yeltsin's dwindling power', highlight the likelihood of the political disintegration of the Russian Federation into a myriad of small and presumably nuclear-armed states. Yet on the other hand Ian Davidson's article, 'No nukes is good nukes', is critical of Ukraine (by comparison a politically stable state) and its possible unwillingness to give away its nuclear weapons (and their uranium which can be used as energy) to Russia. Ian Davidson argues that nuclear weapons should belong to legitimate members of the nuclear club. Who are these legitimate members? China, France, Britain, the US and the USSR. However, the latter has been replaced by 15 (11 excluding the Baltics) equal successor states, four of which - Belarus, Kazhakstan, Ukraine and Russia - have nuclear weapons as part of their inheritance. The fact that 176 Soviet inter-continental ballistic missiles were deliberately stationed in the Ukrainian portion of the Soviet Union and did not 'happen' to be there by chance, as Mr Davidson implies, would not have prevented Ukraine being a legitimate target had deterrence failed and MAD (mutually assured destruction) ensued. However, to end on an optimistic if not realistic note: assuming the US and Russia were to guarantee Ukraine's security and at the same time that of China, France and Britain, then presumably, using the same logic as is used with respect to Ukraine, these three states would divest themselves of nuclear weapons. Or is this just naive Ukrainian wishful thinking?

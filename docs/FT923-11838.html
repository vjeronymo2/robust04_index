			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Cowabunga] Risc management for Turtles - Michiyo Nakamoto details the growth of a small semiconductor company THE sophisticated electronics which allowed the film puppet versions of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon characters to smile and say 'cowabunga]' was developed by a small British company based in Cambridge. Advanced Risc Machines, founded two years ago, developed the reduced instruction set computer (RISC) microprocessors which are at the heart of computer controls inside the Turtles enabling the puppets to talk, pout, blink and snarl. ARM's risc chips were recently chosen by Apple, the US computer company, for its new consumer gadget, an all-in-one portable electronic notebook, word processor, fax machine and computer. The success of the company, which has only 30 employees, is an impressive achievement in an age when large and powerful semiconductor manufacturers have been suffering in the face of intense competition and sharp price falls in certain product areas. It also turns on its head the notion that the UK is infertile ground for nurturing entrepreneurial high technology companies. The company was born out of one very good idea - a chip which offered high performance at low cost and low power consumption. These characteristics make the ARM chip ideal for portable products made in large volume, such as small consumer electronics devices. The chip was originally developed at Acorn, the UK computer offshoot of Olivetti, the Italian computer and office equipment group. Although International Business Machines invented risc chips in the early 1980s, ARM claims its original chip was the first to be commercially available. It was extremely popular among outside engineers, including a group at Apple who liked the fact that it was easy to write software for it. Acorn, faced with increasing development costs, decided to spin off the chip into a joint venture, which was ARM. Acorn retained 46 per cent, Apple held 46 per cent and VLSI Technology, a US manufacturer of semiconductors, which had been a licensee of the technology, had a minority holding. The presence of Apple and Olivetti in the background helped open a few doors to the budding company. Nevertheless, much of the credit for ARM's success goes to the business philosophy of Mr Robin Saxby, managing director, who was recruited to head the group from European Silicon Structures where he was managing director. The business model that Saxby adopted and which has enabled ARM to grow, is one more commonly seen among small entrepreneurial companies in Silicon Valley than in the UK. Mr Saxby calls it 'partnering in multiple dimensions'. It is a strategy of forming wide-ranging partnerships which enables ARM to concentrate mainly on design, leaving other companies to provide additional expertise. Each member brings to the partnership their own strengths and nobody does what someone else can do better, Mr Saxby says. ARM itself will research, design and develop its products. Its partners will look after the manufacturing, which is a capital intensive undertaking that can be of considerable risk for a small company, and much of the marketing and sales efforts. It will, however, train its partners' sales personnel intensively. ARM licenses its technology to outside semiconductor companies but the relationship goes considerably beyond the conventional one between manufacturer and subcontractor. The manufacturers, which Mr Saxby calls ARM's 'semiconductor product partners', work with ARM on joint design, serve as its worldwide marketing and sales force and provide local support. For example, VLSI and GEC Plessey Semiconductors which are are the present licensed manufactures, also market ARM's products. As a result ARM has already been supplying chips to Japan where it does not yet have a presence. ARM also works with universities on long-term research and development. It is working with a group at Manchester University on advanced ARM architecture ideas. These partnerships are a large asset for a small upstart. 'We're the little David fighting the big Goliath but sometimes the little guy can win particularly if he has some big friends,' Mr Saxby says. The strategy of using whatever outside resources it can, if it can do so more effectively, extends to research funding. Because the company has a modest budget it has put a lot of effort into winning public funding for long-term research. For example, ARM is a partner in a project that is being funded by the Open Microsystems Initiative, an EC programme worth Ecu65m (Pounds 46m). It has avoided the pitfall of many innovative companies of having brilliant technologies but not being able to market them successfully, by sticking to a strictly customer-driven business strategy. While the company will research and develop technologies, it will wait until it has found a specific customer who needs to turn those technologies into a product, rather than implement them for their own sake. 'That is how you penetrate markets,' Mr Saxby says. For now, ARM is focusing on those products where it has an edge, the ARM chip and its family of related products. The company is setting its sights on the Japanese market where it sees potential in high volume portable consumer products in which Japanese electronics companies are showing increasing interest. For the Japanese, the ARM partnering strategy also provides a way for them to achieve potential synergies, Mr Saxby says. A series of presentations it made in Japan recently attracted huge crowds and it expects to announce a licensing agreement with a Japanese chip manufacturer by the end of the year.</p>

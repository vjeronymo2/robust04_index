			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Party funding and the state TUESDAY'S ill-tempered debate in the Commons on Conservative party funding presented the mother of parliaments in a poor light. The two leading parties wrestled each other into the gutter over the issue, leaving the disenchanted voter not much wiser about the ethics of the current arrangements. Yet finding ways to finance political parties which do not expose them to sectional pressures from backers is a problem which reaches well beyond Westminster. Most democracies have struggled to ensure that parties are not reliant for funds on business or special interest groups, without conspicuous success. In the UK, the Conservatives have been fending off accusations of handling stolen money in the form of Pounds 440,000 donated by Mr Asil Nadir, the disgraced tycoon. The party relies for much of its income on donations from undisclosed sources, including overseas donors such as Mr John Latsis, the Greek shipping tycoon, and two Hong Kong businessmen. These gifts give the Conservatives a financial advantage in fighting elections, but also expose the party to the charge that the donors are buying influence. The Labour party is even more vulnerable to such charges. The trade unions are fighting a fierce rearguard action to maintain their role in the party's councils, backed by ill-disguised threats to cut off their contributions which make up the bulk of Labour's income. The party also has its own embarrassment in the support it received from the late Mr Robert Maxwell. State funding The opposition parties want state funding of parties to reduce what they see as the Conservatives' unfair advantage. State finance would also reduce party dependence on sectional interests, they say - the reason why most European countries provide some form of public funding for political parties. However, public funding is far from foolproof in ending undesirable links between parties, companies and special interest groups. Countries such as Spain, Italy and France have all found that state finance does not stop parties from becoming involved in dubious money-raising schemes. Even the generous funding provided in Germany, the first European country to finance parties publicly, has failed to stop over-close links between politicians and companies. Providing state support appears to encourage political parties to spend more rather than seek less from supporters. And whatever the theoretical advantages of state funding for political parties, public support for the idea is not strong. Opinion polls in the UK reject it, for example, while an Italian referendum in April voted to end it. The storm over the use of European parliament funds by Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen's group of MEPs to pay for conferences in exotic locations will put pressure on that form of public finance for party politics. Political benefits In practice, UK political parties already receive considerable support from the state other than in general subventions. The opposition parties receive help with their parliamentary expenses through the 'Short money' (named after the minister who first negotiated it). Every MP can employ a researcher at the public expense - a formidable policy resource if properly co-ordinated. Parties benefit from free TV advertising, estimated by a Hansard Society report to have been worth around Pounds 7m at the 1987 general election. There is also a free mailing to every voter and access to publicly-owned premises for election meetings. Such benefits in kind do much to ensure fair competition between the parties, without undermining the UK tradition that parties are voluntary bodies which should find their own funds. That does not, however, justify the secrecy over the source of parties' income. Wealthy people, companies and unions are fully entitled to make donations to the parties they support. There may even be good reasons for wealthy overseas supporters to donate large sums to UK political parties. But the source of party funds is a matter of legitimate public concern to voters. Nothing less than prompt and rigorous disclosure of donations over a modest limit will end the unhealthy speculation that surrounds party funding in Britain.</p>

			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> CUSTODIANS OF THE TRUE HOLIDAY SPIRIT  </P> <P> When it opened 20 months ago, the Episcopal Service Alliance Center for the  homeless, located in the midst of retail stores in Laguna Beach, was threatened  with being set ablaze and was later vandalized. Three months ago, the center  announced that it would close for lack of support. Today, it is on its feet,  thanks to an anonymous donation and help from the community.  </P> <P> In Corona del Mar, volunteers at a program run by St. Michael and All Angels  Episcopal Church have been offering shelter to help homeless people gear up for  winter, to find job leads and counseling. The program, run almost entirely by  volunteers, has recently joined the Orange County Interfaith Housing Shelter  Network, which enlists churches and synagogues as shelters.  </P> <P> As the holiday period unfolds for the more fortunate among us, important  grass-roots organizations such as these are working to help those down on their  luck in Orange County. To assist people in getting back on their feet, the  programs provide various services, including employment aid, food, clothes,  transportation and referrals.  </P> <P> Amid the bustle and preoccupations of the holiday season, these organizations  can be overlooked. But we should remember that they are custodians of the true  holiday spirit. They deserve support and encouragement.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROPOSALS ON BALANCING FEDERAL DEFICIT  </P> <P> The proposal to reduce the mortgage interest deduction to $20,000 maximum must  be killed!  </P> <P> This is another tax on the middle class that unfairly affects all of us in the  Los Angeles and California areas where prices of real estate are double the  national average.  </P> <P> The $20,000 deduction would limit the house value to $220,000, using 10% down  and 10% interest. Prices for homes in the Los Angeles area are much higher than  $220,000 so interest is greater than $20,000.  </P> <P> The effect of passing this limit would be to raise taxes greatly and to reduce  the prices of homes dramatically as people will not be able to afford the  higher payments without the tax deduction.  </P> <P> As a recent retiree (caused by the defense layoffs), my plan to sell my house  and live off the proceeds will be crushed. Add this to the proposal to limit  state and local tax deductions to $10,000 and the current tax on Social  Security the result will be that a retiree's plans for financial independence  will be jeopardized.  </P> <P> Why is it that when it is your turn, they change the rules?  </P> <P> I propose eliminating the interest deduction from second (vacation) homes,  reducing foreign giveaways and taxing the rich at the same level as the middle  class -- 33%.  </P> <P> FRANK GLASER  </P> <P> Rancho Palos Verdes  </P></p>

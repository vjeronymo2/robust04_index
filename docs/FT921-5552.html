			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / International Company News: EC clears Agnelli offer for Exor THE European Commission has cleared the Agnelli family's agreed bid for Exor, which controls Perrier, the French mineral water producer, but only on condition that the Agnellis limit their influence over the mineral water strategy of BSN, the French food group which has launched a counter-bid for Exor. Yesterday's announcement was the first indication of Brussels' attitude in the complex battle for Perrier. The Agnelli/Exor deal was cleared mainly because Ifint, the Agnelli bid vehicle, no longer owns any mineral water brands. The Commission would not comment on its response to any of the other bids and counter-bids in the sector. But it seems likely that other pending mergers - notably Nestle's bid for Perrier, which the Commission is already looking at, and the BSN/Exor deal, which has not yet been notified to Brussels - will pose more problems than Agnelli/Exor because both bidder and prey hold strong positions in the lucrative mineral water market. If any of the bids prompts 'serious doubts' about its effect on the EC market, the Commission will mount a full inquiry, and could, if necessary, block the merger or impose conditions. Although the Agnellis have no direct involvement in the sector, the Commission was concerned about the indirect effect of the family's 5.8 per cent stake in BSN, which owns the Badoit mineral water brand, and the influence of Mr Umberto Agnelli, who has a seat on the BSN board. From now on, Mr Agnelli - brother of Mr Gianni Agnelli, chairman of Fiat - will be unable to take part in discussions and decisions on BSN's mineral water strategy. Nor will the Agnellis be allowed to exchange information with BSN which might 'influence competitive behaviour' in the mineral water sector. Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner, yesterday reminded the Agnellis that the Commission had the option of opening a separate inquiry if the Italian family won control of Perrier and strengthened its links with BSN. That seems unlikely at the moment, since BSN - which wants to acquire the Volvic mineral water brand from Perrier - is now allied with Nestle, in the opposite camp from the Agnellis, and has forbidden the Italians from increasing their stake. Commission officials said yesterday that although Brussels' merger task force was keeping an eye on the whole Perrier situation, each bid would be considered separately, assuming it was large enough to trigger an automatic inquiry in Brussels. Meanwhile, the Conseil des Bourses de Valeurs, a body that regulates the French stock market, yesterday gave the go-ahead to the counter-bid for Perrier unveiled last week by a group of investors led by Exor. The Exor group, which already controls nearly 49 per cent of Perrier, made its offer for the rest of the shares to comply with a CBV ruling. It is offering FFr1,475 a share for the remaining stock, the same as that offered by Nestle. The CBV also decided to allow Perrier and Exor's shares to resume trading on the Paris stock market tomorrow.</p>

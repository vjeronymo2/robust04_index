			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Ill-boding Move" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, June 9 (KCNA) -- Puppet Prime Minister of  South Korea Yi Yong-tok made "a check-up of emergency duty  posture" of "major organs" and the director of the puppet police  agency instructed police to "intensify the alert posture"  against the North. The U.S. Forces stationed in South Korea  staged "an evacuation exercise" to test "prompt departure  preparations" of U.S. troops and their families in case of  emergency.    NODONG SINMUN in a commentary today says that such row can  be  seen only on the eve of a war and it suggests that the Kim  Yong-sam group is leading the situation of the Korean peninsula  nearer to the threshold of war in league with the outside forces.    We urged a stop to such a criminal act as turning the  country  into a nuclear war theatre of foreign forces, warning the Kim  Yong-sam group more than once that "sanctions" sought by the  imperialists under the pretext of fictitious "nuclear suspicion"  against the North mean a war and there is no mercy in a war, the  analyst says, and continues:    But the South Korean puppets, ignoring our warnings, are  bringing clouds of a nuclear war by showing extra zeal in  imposing "sanctions" on fellow countrymen. The "doctrine of  inevitability of sanctions" peddled by the puppets is a doctrine  of inevitability of war.    The puppets must know that their provocative war move  against  the North may cause irrevocably grave consequences.    We want peace, not war. But we will never allow anyone to  provoke us.</p>

			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL REPORT;  </P> <P> WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> AROUND THE NATION;  </P> <P> FLORIDA STATE MAY DECIDE BY NEXT WEEK  </P> <P> Florida State University President Bernard Sliger said Wednesday he hopes to  announce the school's decision on moving to a new conference by the middle of  next week, well ahead of a school-established timetable that allowed to the end  of September.  </P> <P> The Miami Herald reported Wednesday that Florida State is only waiting to be  invited by the Atlantic Coast Conference.  </P> <P> The Southeastern Conference has also been lobbying Florida State, but the ACC  package is more lucrative, Sliger confirmed.  </P> <P> Sliger said that no decision could be announced until the options are presented  to the school's athletic board. That is expected today and a decision is  expected next week.  </P> <P> Florida State presently competes in the Metro Conference in all sports but  football. The Seminoles are independent in football.  </P> <P> Florida State could be competing in most sports by next year, although it would  take several years before the school could play a full conference schedule in  football.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 27 KYODO -- A group of academics on  Thursday [27 January] criticized U.S. trade policy as hindering  free market mechanisms in its demand for the setting of  numerical targets.    The government should not bow to a U.S. request for setting  "objective criteria" as a way to gauge the openness of Japan's  markets, Kazuo Ueda, a professor of economics at the University  of Tokyo, told a press conference.    The United States should retract such a request and Japan  should reject it and express a strong determination to protect  the free trading system as "a public good of the world," Ueda  said. The move came against increasing U.S. demands for Tokyo  to take action to break the stalled trade "framework" talks.    Ueda's group prepared a report in which they oppose what  they  view as the U.S. policy of managed trade. Ueda said allowing  the bilateral framework talks to fail would be a better  alternative for Japan than making "an easy compromise" under  U.S. threats such as trade sanctions.    Motoshige Itoh said the blame should be put more on the  Japanese Government for "erroneously" accepting a 20 percent  foreign market share target in its chip trade talks with the  U.S. "That was very dangerous for free trade," said Itoh, who  is also a professor of economics at the University of Tokyo.    Ueda said it was "strategically" a mistake for Japan to have  accepted "sets of objective criteria, either qualitative or  quantitative or both" in the July 1993 summit between then Prime  Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton.    Ueda said the position paper, prepared last week, has  already  been distributed to about 170 Japanese scholars nationwide, of  which 154 supported it and one opposed it. The paper will be  sent to U.S. President Bill Clinton as well as the U.S. Trade  Representative (USTR) and the Treasury Department, he said.    Japan's agreement to numerical trade targets would not serve  its interest in any case, the paper said. If the step results  in an import rise in one trade area, the U.S. may seek a similar  request in other sectors, escalating government-led managed  trade practices in order to meet the new demands, the paper said.    In the event of failure to meet a pledged goal, a probable  result would be punitive measures by the U.S., the paper said.    To improve foreign access to Japanese markets, the paper  proposed removing various government controls that hamper  competition, such as restrictive business deals and unnecessary  administrative rules and permits. Strict enforcement of the  Antimonopoly Law, along with an easing of these regulations,  would help reduce the prices gap between Japan and abroad,  eventually serving the interest of Japan and foreign countries,  it said.</p>

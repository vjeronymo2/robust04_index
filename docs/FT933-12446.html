			<p>930723 FT  23 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shares firmer after nervous session TURMOIL in the ERM currencies came to the aid of a London stock market otherwise overshadowed by uncertainty ahead of the UK parliamentary debate on the Maastricht legislation, which continued long after the stock market closed yesterday. With UK government bonds rallying in late dealings as sterling advanced, share prices edged higher at the end of an erratic trading session. However, the six-point gain in the FT-SE 100 Index owed much to a rally in the oil and pharmaceutical sectors, with the rest of the market lacking direction. Dealers stressed that the market was lethargic for most of the session, and that the big institutions were disinclined to trade ahead of the Maastricht debate. Shares opened firmly, encouraged by a record close on the Dow Industrial Average overnight, which was translated into gains in the battered pharmaceutical sector and to a firm start in stock index futures. But most share price gains served to attract immediate profit-taking and the stock market soon reacted to initial weakness in the bond market. By early afternoon, London, also discouraged by signs of a slow start on Wall Street, was down by 2.2 to a Footsie reading of 2,811.9. There were further signs that the institutions, while keeping a low profile, were not averse to selling stock if they could. The day's Seaq volume rose to 581.8m shares from Wednesday's 554m, when retail, or customer, business remained high at Pounds 1.33bn. The rally in the bond market provided the encouragement for a similar move by equities. At the final reading, the FT-SE Index showed a gain of 6.0 at 2,820.1. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, covering a broader range of UK stocks, recaptured an important benchmark to close 5.1 higher at 3,200.5 as interest in second line stocks revived. Sterling's firmness, which would not long ago have been seen as a prop for cutting domestic interest rates, was regarded with mixed feelings in equities, where this week's fresh evidence of recovery in the UK economy has been seen as reducing the likelihood of an early rate cut. 'A further rise in sterling would weaken profits growth,' commented Marcus Grubb at Salomon Brothers, rounding up the factors causing him to downgrade his six-month target for the Footsie to 3,000. The other factors include a bias towards fiscal tightening under the new chancellor of the exchequer, poor corporate dividend growth and the weakness of Mr Major's government. However, Mr Grubb is holding his 12-month Footsie target at 3,200. The stock market's concern over the domestic politial scene now encompasses not only the outcome of last night's crucial parliamentary debate but also the challenge to Maastricht pending in the UK courts, and also the like-lihood of a drubbing for the government at next week's by-election at Christchurch, in Dorset. Across the broad range of UK equities, the store and consumer sectors, restrained by uncertainty over the outlook for profits, made only a modest response to this week's indication that economic recovery continues to boost spending in the high street. The brightest features came among the international blue chips.</p>

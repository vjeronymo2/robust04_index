			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Brazil to resume state sell-offs SELL-OFF dates and minimum prices for two state companies have been announced by Brazil's President Itamar Franco in a clear sign that the privatisation programme is to resume after a four-month delay. Poliolefinas, a petrochemicals company, will be auctioned on Friday at the minimum price of Dollars 86.1m (Pounds 60.6m). The sale of the National Steel Company has been scheduled for April 2 with a minimum price of Dollars 1.6bn, despite complaints by its president that it has been undervalued. The decision to go ahead with the sales represents a policy turnaround for Mr Franco, who suspended the programme in December after making frequent criticisms. Only two weeks ago Mr Antonio Barros de Castro, who as head of the National Development Bank was responsible for the programme, resigned, accusing the president of deliberately blocking the process. Last week Mr Eliseu Resende, the new finance minister, announced a 'deepening and acceleration' of the programme as one of his central policies. Ministry officials are even discussing with Mr Franco the sale of assets such as Vale do Rio Doce, the state mining company, and Telebras, the telecommunications company. Mr Franco's change of heart was apparently motivated by the discovery of the privileges and high salaries enjoyed by the state sector and the considerable costs to the government. This year the state sector will cost Brazil an estimated Dollars 19bn and pay back a maximum of Dollars 10bn in taxes. Mr Fernando Antonio Habda, a member of the economic policy team, said: 'The President wants to boost government credibility and raise money for social programmes and buying back debt. He now realises that the only option is privatisation.' It is not yet clear what rules will govern the forthcoming sales to meet Mr Franco's concerns over issues such as the currency used in the auctions. Only 1 per cent of the Dollars 4bn raised in sell-offs by the former government was in cash, the rest mainly consisting of domestic debt swapped at par.</p>

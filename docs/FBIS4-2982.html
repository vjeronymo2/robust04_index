			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 15 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Government  has no intention to force Macao residents of Portuguese decedent  born in Macao to become Chinese citizens, a Foreign Ministry  spokesman said here today.    The spokesman was answering a question from a correspondent  who asked, "some of the Macao citizens very worry about losing  their present Portuguese citizenship after 1999, and the  Portuguese Government is much concerned about this. What is  your comment on it?"    He said that the question of citizenship for Macao residents  of Portuguese decedent who were born in Macao could be properly  solved through consultations by the Sino-Portuguese Joint  Liaison Group.    The spokesman said that the general attitude of the Chinese  Government is as follows:    -- Consistence with principles laid down in the Chinese  Nationality Law;    -- Being mindful of Macao's history and reality;    -- And respect for the free will of the persons in question  and freedom of choice in deciding one's nationality.    He said that the Chinese Government has no intention to  force  Macao citizens of Portuguese decedent born in Macao to become  Chinese citizens and "we hope that they will remove misgivings  and continue to live in Macao".</p>

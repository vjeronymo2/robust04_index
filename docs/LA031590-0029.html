			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> TRUSTEE IN DEBT TO CASINOS, OFFICIALS SAY;  </P> <P> GAMBLING: TOM ELY, WHO IS RUNNING FOR COUNTY SUPERVISOR, DENIES INCURRING THE  DEBTS. BUT AUTHORITIES SAY NEVADA OFFICIALS HAVE COMPILED A LIST.  </P> <P> Ventura Community College District Trustee Tom Ely has incurred about $40,000  in gambling debts at more than half a dozen Nevada casinos, law enforcement  sources have told The Times.  </P> <P> Ely, 54, who is running for the Ventura County Board of Supervisors, owes the  money to some of the best known casinos and hotels in Las Vegas, including the  Aladdin, the Dunes and the Sands, the law enforcement sources said.  </P> <P> The Times learned that Nevada officials have compiled a list of alleged Ely  gambling debts that includes $9,000 to the Aladdin, $5,000 to the Dunes, $3,500  to the Sands, $4,700 to Maxim's and $2,000 to Bally's.  </P> <P> When asked about those amounts, Las Vegas police Detective Ned Brodeur on  Wednesday confirmed that there is such a list. But he declined to go into  specifics.  </P> <P> "That's true," Brodeur said. "You've done your homework."  </P> <P> The latest disclosures of alleged gambling debts by Ely followed a report last  week that he owed $3,000 to the Edgewater Hotel and Casino of Laughlin, Nev.,  and a subsequent revelation that he is being sued by another casino, the Golden  Nugget in Las Vegas, over $8,000 in alleged debts.  </P> <P> Brodeur said Wednesday that only one of the casinos, the Edgewater, has filed  any complaint with the police. He added that the complaint was dropped this  week after the debt was settled.  </P> <P> Most casinos allow indebted gamblers a grace period before seeking police  intervention, Brodeur said, although the debts would be listed with the State  Gaming Control Board of Nevada during periodic casino audits.  </P> <P> Ely denied Wednesday that he had incurred the gambling debts, adding that his  attorney has advised him not to comment because "there's all kinds of legal  action coming."  </P> <P> Ely said he will remain in the supervisorial race to represent the 4th  District, which includes Simi Valley, Moorpark, Somis and the Santa Rosa  Valley.  </P> <P> "Nobody has anywhere near the experience I do," said Ely, who has been an  elected community college trustee, a job that pays $400 a month, since 1979.  </P> <P> The state Gaming Control Board of Nevada refused Wednesday to comment on Ely's  alleged indebtedness. None of the casinos would comment publicly either, citing  policies guaranteeing confidentiality for clients.  </P> <P> Brodeur said the Edgewater Hotel and Casino's complaint against Ely was for  $3,000 in gambling debts that Ely had incurred last June.  </P> <P> On Sunday, Ely told The Times that he had settled his debts with the Edgewater  in June "in cash."  </P> <P> But Brodeur said the casino notified him Wednesday that Ely had sent the $3,000  by express mail over the weekend after learning that a warrant for his arrest  would be issued unless he immediately settled the debt.  </P> <P> "There are a million stories in the Naked City, and this is just one of them,"  Brodeur said.  </P> <P> Ely also told The Times on Sunday that he did not have a gambling problem and  had not visited Laughlin, Nev., since June, when he and his wife, Ingrid,  played blackjack and the slot machines at the Edgewater.  </P> <P> Brodeur disputed that account Wednesday, saying Ely had incurred the bulk of  the debts in Las Vegas after visiting Laughlin in June.  </P> <P> The lawsuit filed against Ely by the Golden Nugget Hotel and Casino on Feb. 20  also refers to a later Nevada gambling debt incurred by Ely in July, charging  that he signed five "markers" for $8,000, to be drawn on his account at Simi  Valley Bank.  </P> <P> The suit alleges that when the casino attempted to collect the debt, it found  that Ely's account at the bank had been closed. A source at the bank told The  Times that Ely's account was closed by the bank because it was overdrawn.  </P> <P> Trustees on the five-member Ventura Community College Board said Wednesday that  they are concerned that the gambling allegations against Ely will damage the  board's reputation. Two trustees said Wednesday that Ely should consider  resigning or face possible impeachment proceedings or a recall.  </P> <P> "There seems to be a problem with Tom's credibility, and that disturbs me,"  Trustee Greg Cole said. "I have some grave problems with this -- public office  is a public trust."  </P> <P> College Trustee President Greg Kampf said he is concerned about the impact that  the gambling allegations may have on the college board.  </P> <P> "It's certainly not a positive thing for the board," he said. "It's not going  to add to the district's reputation."  </P> <P> A flamboyant figure who often appears at board meetings festooned in gold rings  and chains, Ely is a former board president who refers to himself as "Dr. Ely"  in official correspondence.  </P> <P> Ely has a law degree from Ventura College of Law but has not passed the state  bar exam, according to the California State Bar Assn.  </P> <P> Former trustees contacted by The Times recalled that Ely once shocked the board  by revealing that he carried a handgun in his briefcase. Ely said Wednesday  that he had a permit to carry a concealed weapon to protect himself in case his  car broke down on a dark country road.  </P> <P> Ely has run for public office before. In 1986, he lost a bid to become mayor of  Simi Valley.  </P></p>

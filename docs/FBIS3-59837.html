			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Supplement prepared by 'Abdallah al-Qabi': "Consultation </F> and Change; Saudi National Day"]    [Text]  <H3>  `Consultation, Islamic Method of Representation,' by Shaykh  'Abdallah Ibn Husayn al-Ahmar, speaker of the Yemeni House of  Representatives </H3>   The Saudi Consultative Council [Shura], the formation of  which was recently announced, is considered a good, progressive  step on the correct path, because it confirms how deeply the  value of the Shura is embedded in our people, no matter what  unforseen events befall them. It is a blessed act for which we  commend Saudi Arabia--king, government, and people.    As Muslims, we consider the Shura a positive value and a  shari'ah obligation. There is no dispute about Shura being a  characteristic of fundamentalist believers, because God has  imposed it as an obligatory duty which must be pursued, or  rather, He coupled it with belief in Him, and with the  obligation of prayer. He said: "Those who respond to their Lord  and keep up prayer, and whose affairs are (decided) by counsel  among themselves, and who spend out of what we have given them."    Shura is not merely a transitory idea or an emergency  measure. On the contrary, it is a deep-rooted precept in our  awareness and behavior. However, the events that have occurred  have been far removed from the spirit of religion and,  consequently, we were cut off from the principles, values, and  morals of our religion, including the principle of Shura.    When Shura is absent from our reality, our lives become  troubled and controlled by high-handedness and individual  hegemony. Because of that, corruption, tyranny, and difficulties  of life spread.    With this position that Shura occupies in our heritage, and  with this conscious understanding of its beneficial effects and  positive results, we are aware that Shura is nothing new to us.  It is no alien import from the West. But the break with this  principle for centuries has made it appear to be a modern form,  as if it were new to us, while it is "our goods that have  returned to us."    Therefore, Shura is our precept or fundamental principle.  Its  application has, in fact, taken various forms and methods  including, most importantly, representation in the form of  parliamentary and representative councils, as well as  consultative, as a means of representation.    The highest expression of Shura application is in  representative councils, which are considered a true and  realistic expression of the meaning of Shura, which has remained  blocked-off in letter and theory. Shura is now changing in  practice, through "representative" consultative councils, from  the stage of principle to the stage of practical application.    Moreover, even though Shura is obligatory in principle, it  has not been confined to a rigid framework, in terms of methods  and forms. It carries the concept of collectivism, consultation,  and the exchange of ideas, free from absolutism in points of  view or adherence to special positions. In terms of ways to  apply it in practice, one should benefit from the experience and  expertise of others. This strengthens its correctness and  success. Islam leaves that to theological judgement and  interpretation by changes and modifications.  <H3>  `Saudi Role in Gulf Scene Strengthens Its Arab Leadership'  by al-Shadhili al-Qulaybi </H3>   After the convulsion that began in the summer of 1990, which  shook the Arab nation from one end to the other, our people have  remained upset, at odds over diverging views, differing in what  constitutes best interests, with a prevailing malaise here and  there.    Should our people remain waiting for whatever an  international system might provide them three years after that  hurricane, which destroyed structures, wasted resources, and  monopolized the senses? Should they wait for it to rescue them  from the fall and, possibly, save our countries from  circumstances that prevent our society from resuming the  building of its honor?    The answer to those questions is that, no matter what  developments occur in the world, a system will not emerge that  is based on anything other than the old system that the world  has offered. This system is that the strongest benefit, and the  interests of the major powers get the highest attention.    It has been said that nations have no friendship, only  interests. We could add to that: "Interests of the major powers  always precede all principles and values." We should not be  blind, in any time or place, to the congruence between the  interests of the strongest and the principles of international  law. They are circumstantial and transient. One should not rely  on them as permanent, fixed principles, because international  politics is unjust by nature, by virtue of the tyranny of  national interests. They rise above principles and values,  whenever incompatibility occurs between them. We have seen that  in many regional crises, the most recent and ugly in the tragedy  of Bosnia. In this regard, many of those with international  influence were in collusion to enable the Serbian side, at stage  after stage, to continue its campaign of murder and population  displacement, which could have been stopped in the beginning if  the so-called leading nations had the political will for  international action.    This was the truth once, but is it not the duty of our  countries, despite all the negative aspects of mutual action--at  the Gulf, Arab, and Islamic levels; and is it not also in our  people's interests, despite the continuation of dashed hopes,  and despite the violent storms that still rage around them; is  it not the duty and in our best interests to rely on ourselves,  to rescue our present from sliding more and more into the abyss,  to bear the responsibility for our future until we achieve the  prosperity, strength, and honor we desire?    Therefore, we are in urgent need of an awakening that  possesses clarity of vision in thinking and derives  determination from our collective pride. Our people are always  in the position of "low hand" in the international community.    However, this matter requires some explanation, especially  after the violent winds that blew away the concepts of "Arabism"  and "ummah" [Arab Islamic community as a whole].    Before any other consideration, Arabism is a cultural bond  between the peoples who chose this affiliation and the source of  this gift, the Arabian Peninsula. It fashioned this miraculous  language that we have used for more than 14 centuries. It is  still in constant development, but maintains its fundamental  components. These peoples, West and East, both black and the  white races, chose to be Arab. Many times, many of them  tarnished its image. It is incumbent upon our countries to do  everything possible to remove from our people the blemish of  backwardness, not only to defend Arab honor, but also so that  our people will share in prosperity and progress.    Therefore, one should review, at the outset, how we have  gone  astray, both in the past and now, in regard to the concept of  ummah and mutual Arab action. In the past, the concept of  Arabism--or the Arab ummah--was misused at times. We should not  necessarily be led into discarding this marvelous bond or into  renouncing its duties. The defect does not lie in the reality of  this bond, but rather in the method of comprehending and dealing  with its development. One of the lessons of the past is that--in  the future--we must not rely on some idea or malign some  principle without closely examining the results, analyzing the  consequences, and agreeing on means of implementation, so that  concepts are clear and satisfy--solidly and firmly--the  principles that govern our acts. The Arab decision should be  guaranteed implementation, because of the vision and profound  dialogue that preceded it.    We accept the profoundness and value of the historic and  cultural bond that cements some of our people to others. We must  be persuaded that our destinies should be closely bound together  in prosperity and adversity, both as regards our affairs inside  the region and in our relations with the rest of the world.    At this point, one must offer a number of observations:     -  Removing the blemish of backwardness from Arabs in general  will not be what keeps the Arab people as one. They may be  marked by that. There is no room for egoism in our war against  backwardness. It is an all-out war, whose only meaning is its  universality for all peoples affiliated with Arabism.    -  The issue of Palestine is not a regional issue, not an issue  of  its leadership, but rather, it is an issue of one of our peoples  in trust to all of us. Would we be satisfied with history  holding us accountable for the loss of Palestine, as it held our  forefathers accountable for the loss of Andalusia? Therefore,  acceptance of the importance of the Palestinian negotiator--or  the Syrian, Lebanese, or Jordanian--is only defending the Arab  right, so that we can regain the most that is possible.    -  Then, with the regaining of Palestine, or most of Palestine,  Israel will still remain a tyrannical power in the region,  displaying animosity to all Arabs and on guard against them. As  a result, our countries will continue to squander our vast  wealth on armament and security, which will only result in our  being distracted from the substantive. The substantive is the  issue of growth. The nation whose ruler took the initiative that  led to the Fez peace plan can only play a major role in support  of the efforts aimed at peace. I do not say a "just peace," but  one can only accept it and be reassured.    -  Coming out of backwardness is not only one of the duties of  Arab honor; it is also a requirement of Arab security. The more  our people have command of the sciences and different kinds of  technology, the more they will be able to protect their security  themselves.    -  Our people must choose the specific nature of their destiny:  Are they content to always remain a geographic region in the  path of violent international interests? Or, do they want to  have self-identity, effectively making decisions with regard to  their own affairs, and a voice to be heard in international  assemblies?    -  One cannot ignore the past. We will have wasted its lessons  if  we treat it with forgetfulness. However, the past must not  fetter us, but should open windows of the future for us. What  concerns our people and their security is the revival of their  present situation and excellent preparation for their future.  This is what is required from us, we are not prisoners of past  negative factors. We must head into the future with all the  insight, courage, and enthusiasm that we have. Other than that  will keep our people in positions of weakness and fragmented  ideas. Their efforts will fail and they will go with the  wind.       It behooves our countries to work within these crucial  facts,  no matter how powerful past experiences were, and no matter how  shaken their confidence in their "brother" Arabs. For all these  considerations, a true awakening must encompass the entire Arab  nation, from the Gulf to the Atlantic. So that this necessary  awakening will occur, there must be strong leadership to take  charge. Capabilities must be gathered, and a call put forth for  the "Great Jihad": the jihad of the spirit, in which rancor and  separatist inclinations are spreading; the jihad against  backwardness, because of which our people suffered for centuries  from the woes of defeats and humiliations. Leadership in this  awesome matter must be able to assume responsibility for  coordinating viewpoints, rallying spirits, and directing  efforts. The drive will only come from one of our countries, or  a group of countries, with a decisive stand that is adopted from  our religious past, and which is pursued on a new course to open  the gates of the future.    In the first rank of those qualified to assume this role is,  without a doubt, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, by virtue of its  traditional Arab role of strengthening developmental efforts in  various countries, and because of the astonishing leap forward  that it has made in this regard in basic fields, such as  education, forming highly-trained brilliant cadres in  administrative and social, economic, and political affairs. By  looking at the high percentage of cohesion that surrounds our  people, thanks to the comprehensive development policy for all  areas of the kingdom and all its social groups, there is no  doubt that the new measures pertaining to the Consultative  Council [Shura] and to government in the kingdom's provinces,  will strengthen the cohesion of the kingdom's people, by  supporting methods and techniques of Shura and broadening its  area. They will also strengthen the organization of governmental  powers, since the usefulness of the government's work will be  doubled. Shura will increase its influence and credibility with  public opinion. It is certain that these measures--and those  that will doubtlessly follow--will cause the governmental system  to keep more and more in step with the social and intellectual  awakening that has been spreading throughout the country for the  past two or three decades.    It is also certain that the role that the kingdom plays on  the Gulf scene is influential in solidifying the Gulf's Arab  leadership. All indicators point to the fact that this role will  increase in importance in the future, because of the magnitude  of the kingdom's size, the enormity of its wealth over the long  term, the ancestral heritage of its state, and the importance of  its population numbers. These are some of the considerations  that gives it its power inside the Gulf Cooperation Council  [GCC], gives it its influence, and makes it a mediator and  authority. Many observers from outside the Gulf, even non-Arab  observers, expect positive developments in view of this, which  will enable the GCC to overcome its preoccupation with long,  slow-moving "approaches." In taking a decisive step toward some  form of federation, much time, effort, and money could be saved,  and the long line of security and defense plans avoided. A  responsible, effective, cohesive power in the area and inside  the Arab family could be formed from that, within the framework  of the Islamic community. This would increase the kingdom's  fitness for leadership responsibilities, for which it stands  alone on the international scene, with an increasingly effective  role in economic, financial, and political areas.    Our Arab people, east and west, are Islamic as a whole,  either by embracing Islam as a religion, or by feeling at ease  with it culturally. The overwhelming majority of our Christian  citizens confirm this, in Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Jordan, and  Palestine, and also in Lebanon, despite the tragedy suffered by  the Lebanese. This is also confirmed by many Jews who have  settled among them in 10 good Arab nations, the likes of which  they did not find--not in the past nor in modern times--in the  European areas that allege today to be for human rights.    Our peoples' relationship with Islam makes them responsible  for the renaissance of Islamic society, so that its first  emergence, which fashioned that great civilization and created  that comprehensive culture, is renewed. Within that culture, the  idea of adopting the causes of progress and development matured.    The Islamic society will only be able to attain a renewed  emergence by reviving the principles that were one of the  factors of its power and the brilliance of its direction. They  are:     -  The principle of ijtihad [independent legal judgement],  through acts of opinion and use of reason in religious and  worldly affairs.    -  Quest of knowledge: This is obligatory on individuals and the  group "even if in China."    -  Hard work and labor, to earn one's livelihood and sustain the  needs of the ummah.    -  Solidarity among individuals and peoples alike.    -  Shura, so that the ummah is safe from civil strife and the  disaster of tyranny and absolutism in opinion.    -  Tolerance, which has made one of our Arab capitals a unique  model for peaceful coexistence of people of various religious  sects.       With these principles, the Islamic society was a power, its  various groups cohesive, and the sciences and their technologies  flourished, so that the authority which was Europe borrowed from  it. Whenever we lose those principles, power and sovereignty  slip away, economic prosperity declines in our countries,  intellectual movement in our societies stagnates, and the true  sciences are suppressed in our educational institutions. Our  peoples' conditions worsen, and they are dominated by those  nations that acquired sciences and culture from them, because  they adopted the same principles that had made us the leaders  and that--today--strengthen the nations that lead the  international community.    We are more deserving of these principles, because they were  originally in our doctrine, one of the pillars of our  civilization. We would not have needed someone else's  enlightenment to discover them, if there had been no inclination  to replace this important part of our intellectual and cultural  heritage.    Today, our people need to awaken from their cultural slumber  and return to their first way of life, with regard to judgement  in the rest of their affairs, in order to return to a place of  honor among nations. But we must, therefore, be able to stop the  civil strife that gnaws at some of our countries, threatens to  spread into others, and is on the verge of destroying the costly  gains that we cherish.    All our Arab and Islamic nations must heed this call, which  requires universal effort and multiple directions and levels: in  the framework of education, on the cultural and intellectual  level, and in areas of social and economic reorganizations. All  of that rests on each country equally, through collective labor  in which all our nations participate, with the required  effectiveness and breadth of vision.    In this noble work, the kingdom's role will be distinctive,  thanks to the sum of the factors to which I referred earlier, in  addition to the honor of embracing the two holy mosques. It is a  responsibility that the kingdom bears in the most admirable  manner, and from which King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz derives his  title. We believe that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, in firm  cooperation with other of our prominent nations, will be able to  drive the process of cultural revival, in which religious duty,  moral restraint, and best interests must coincide, now and in  the future.    People will only rally around a noble idea that will drive  intellectual efforts and rally spiritual energies. At this stage  of our people's history, the big undertaking is the ability to  bring them together and revive their enthusiasm anew, revive the  Arab, Islamic civilization and to plan for a cultural  "revolution" aimed at attaining progress, prosperity, and honor,  starting from our fundamental cultural principles and our high  spiritual values.  <H3>  `Concerning Shura and Change,' by Munah al-Solh, Lebanese  politician and writer </H3>   Government is choice. The custodian of the two holy mosques  has chosen to give Shura. This is an Islamic principle and the  method in force in the kingdom is a kind of council, with its  form, personnel, and bases for action, within a framework of  process of change. This was chosen as the method by King Fahd  from the start of his exercise of official responsibility, even  before he became king.    His decision was made within local, Arab, and Islamic  circumstances. The purpose was to generate confidence in  abilities and capabilities and in the maturity to develop the  Saudi society. This began with the reign of King 'Abd-al-'Aziz  and has continued through the reign of King Fahd. In this stage,  building and modernization has burst forth, marked by broad,  comprehensive change in the growth of human capabilities,  professional qualifications, and progress, in addition to the  material infrastructure.    All of this develops at a time when the kingdom's role in  Arab, Islamic, and international circles is being  comprehensively expanded through friendships and despite  enmities. The spotlight points basically toward Islam, with its  holy places, and on Arabism in the cradle of its inception.    These intentions and manifestations have been nurtured in  the  hearts of the kingdom's mature people, who have grown in  society, with a collective decision to heed the call of duty,  since it is for king, nation, Arabism, and Islam.    Naturally, the guardian of the two holy mosques was the  first  to perceive this historic maturity. He is the one who guided and  watched over the growth of Saudi capabilities. He searched for  and encouraged them in various fields. The four royal decrees,  which arose from tangible and developed facts, rest on King  Fahd's wager on the maturity of his people, especially the  professional and intellectual elite of these people, to carry  all the burdens of a institutionalization stage. Proof of this  is the order to create the Consultative Council and the other  orders for change.    These orders, and the direct changes they contain for the  kingdom's people and society, have received support and  admiration from every Arab and Muslim and every impartial  objective observer in the world. These changes are recognized  again as the lofty spirit of Islam--more open than any other at  any time or place, able to keep pace with developments,  believing in science, a friend of mankind, unlimited in its  excellent abilities. They are the spirit the Muslims adopt as  their way toward progress and renewal of their historic role in  the guidance of mankind.    This spirit, which the Arab and Islamic ummah--and the  Arabian Peninsula itself--extended at another time, and the  capability to continue the renewal, is behind the decision to  create the Consultative Council, which in all the world has had  the best reverberations. In fact, it deserves more praise than  the world has given it, in view of its importance and the values  that it encompasses, in terms of a spirit of justice, openness,  and wisdom. It is its nature to serve the Islamic reputation at  a time in which Islam is being buffeted by campaigns directed  from abroad, with their racist and greedy initiatives,  benefiting from the errors and wrongs perpetrated by certain  Muslims, whose actions and behavior leave a false impression  regarding the spirit and goals of Islam.    The truth is that every Arab and Muslim should thank King  Fahd for this step, which will make the kingdom--domestically  and abroad--spiritually stronger, with friendship and  solidarity, and will give more opportunity for the capabilities  and wills of Arabs and Muslims to serve and participate.  <H3>  `Concerning Shura and the System of Government,' by Mustafa  Ahmad Ibn Halim, former Libyan prime minister </H3>   Certain Arab intellectuals, influenced by Western culture,  call for imitating the Western system, either in sum or in  detail (perhaps, this call confirms the view of the great  Islamic scholar, 'Abd-al-Rahman Ibn Khaldun, who said in his  famous preface: "The vanquished often copy the victor.")    In my humble opinion, we should not imitate the Western  parliamentary system and interpose it into Islamic countries  without any consideration for the words of God's book and the  sunna of His Prophet, in terms of the lofty principles and  precedents as established by the orthodox caliphs pertaining to  systems of government, Shura, human rights, and high values in  the ruler's dealings with citizens. I say that this imitating  exceeds the bounds and is erroneous. Therefore, it behooves us  to turn back to that valuable treasure, those noble Islamic  concepts and practices, and extract a system of Shura from our  shari'ah and legacy, which will regulate the affairs of  government and provide the Islamic peoples with freedom,  justice, and the opportunity for growth and prosperity.    From history and fact, I would say that Western democracy,  which some in our Arab world try to imitate, is a recent  occurrence that the Western peoples produced after bloody,  political uprisings, ruinous wars, and violent revolutions over  many centuries. Moreover, contemporary, Western democratic  systems only completed their growth and development in the first  part of this century, after five centuries of bitter strife  between the rigidity of the Catholic Church and the trends of  liberating thought. These ideas seeped into Europe after the  writings of Andalusian Arabs were translated into Latin and  distributed in centers of European thought, especially the  writings of Abi Walid Ibn Rushd (1126-1198).    Why should we imitate Westerners in a system that was  established to deal with their traditions, values, and  aspirations, which differ from our traditions, values, and  aspirations? Why should we not return to our Arab, Islamic  roots, the shari'ah, sunna, heritage, values, and experience  after practical applications? From all of this, we can derive a  system of Islamic, consultative government, which will promote  justice, security, and safety, protect human rights and  integrity, open horizons for our Islamic peoples to progress and  prosperity, hasten their way on their cultural journey, and  strengthen and organize their standing and effectiveness within  the new world order.    It is correct to say that the equitable, fair standard by  which any system of government should be evaluated lies in the  degree of stability, security, safety, and opportunity for  progress and prosperity that this system provides its people;  the climate of freedom, justice, and human rights that the  people enjoy; and the harmony and solidarity between ruler and  the masses of people in the course of cultural progress. By this  equitable standard, there is no doubt that the Saudi people are,  in fact, proud of and devoted to their judicious, rightly-guided  system. They are in harmony and solidarity with their brilliant  leaders who have steered them--for generations--toward the  highest stages of progress and the broadest horizons of culture,  in an atmosphere of freedom, justice, and stability. The Saudi  people have come to enjoy security, freedom, privileges, and  comforts seldom found in any country similar to Saudi Arabia in  the circumstances of its establishment and development. From  that magnificent day on which the late King 'Abd-al-'Aziz  unified the Saudi country and established a true, Islamic system  of government, the course of rapid progress and judicious  development continued in firm steps toward higher stages of  civilization and prosperity, despite the fact the journey began  from virtually nothing.    With regard to where this blessed journey began, perhaps it  would be appropriate to mention here what I heard from my late  father upon his return from his last pilgrimage in 1938. He  compared that pilgrimage with his first one in 1912, during the  Hashemite rule of the Hijaz. He told me that the first thing he  did in preparing for his first trip to Mecca was to buy a gun to  protect himself and his companions against highway robbers,  especially on the caravan route between Mecca and Medina.  However, on his last pilgrimage, he felt safe and secure. The  regime provided him and the rest of the pilgrims with the  necessary facilities and basic services. He performed his  obligation in ease and comfort.    This was in regard to security and safety. As for civilized  development, it is worth pointing out the basic fact that God  did not afflict Saudi Arabia with the wrath of colonialism but,  on the other hand, it did not enjoy some of the "privileges of  colonialism!" (The reader may think it odd that I would say that  colonialism had certain privileges. I am from a country and  generation both of whom suffered from the woes of odious  colonialism.) Colonialism might have had some benefits, as  happened in my first country, Libya. The Italians erected many  buildings and built most of the public facilities, including  roads, ports, hospitals, electricity and telephone networks,  etc. But, the colonialists built the buildings and constructed  the public facilities to be enjoyed by the children of their  countrymen, the Italian settlers. However, God's power is great;  the Italians were defeated and the Libyans inherited those  facilities and buildings, in spite of the colonialists. We had  begun our civilizing journey in Libya. The country's public  facilities and its infrastructure were sound, save for some war  damage.    In Saudi Arabia, the journey toward prosperity started from  zero. I personally saw some of the effects of this fact on my  first visit to Saudi Arabia in October 1957, at the kind  invitation of the late King Sa'ud. On that visit, my attention  was drawn to the fact that that journey toward civilization was  still in its first stages. The city of Riyadh did not compare at  all with West Tripoli, for example. The public  services--electricity, telephone, water and sewage  extensions--did not compare with their counterparts in Libya. I  mentioned that I saluted King Sa'ud, because he invited the late  Dr. 'Abd-al-Wahhab 'Azzam to help him establish the first  university in the kingdom, while the first Libyan university was  built and began operation in 1955 in Benghazi, specifically in  the al-Manar Castle, which the late King Idris had abandoned and  which, in fact, had been headquarters for the Italian governor  general. We inherited it as part of our inheritance from the  Italians.    I should not fail to mention that oil would not be  discovered  in Libya until 1957.    Today the level of progress in Saudi Arabia has reached an  astonishing degree. Construction and the major development of  public facilities has spread, until it can be compared with its  counterparts in America and Europe. Saudi cities, especially  Jiddah and Riyadh, have reached a level of organization,  prosperity, and expansion commensurate with the foremost cities  of the world.    Universities have multiplied; there are now seven, including  departments that provide higher education (masters degrees and  doctorates). The number of graduates has multiplied and totals  tens of thousands. Specialized hospitals are located throughout  the kingdom. The number of students in elementary, preparatory,  and secondary schools is in the millions. Saudi Arabia has also  become a major source for agricultural products.    I could go on and on, describing the situation in Saudi  Arabia today, fairly and accurately.    Let us now quickly compare the situations of the Saudi and  Libyan peoples. Despite the fact that the ruling regime in Libya  has earned oil revenues over the past 20 years that exceed $250  billion, after the discovery of oil in Libya during the previous  monarchy, and the successes of discovering oil riches with a  speed that is nearly miraculous, and the explosion of that ideal  capability from oil profits during the monarchy, the truth  seeker has the right to question what this enormous wealth has  done for the Libyan people. How much progress, prosperity,  freedom, and security do they enjoy?    So that I may be fair, I will cite here a literal  translation  of our article published in the famous economic magazine, THE  ECONOMIST, about Libya. We said: "Despite the fact that there is  wide latitude for action in projects to improve health and  education services, a comparison of the simplest measures of  economic and social progress shows that, after 40 years of  independence, after 30 years of oil revenues and especially  after 20 years of oil income to a utopian degree, Libya still  occupies its humble position among the poorest countries of the  world, as concerns education, the average age for Libyans, and  their nutrition and health. In these areas, Libya also occupies  the lowest level among the OPEC nations, or rather, the worst  level. In some aspects of public services, which touch the lives  of all individuals, the level of those services in Libya is  lower than that in Tunisia and the Arab Republic of Egypt.  According to well-known facts that we have, and according to our  expectations, the gap between Libya and the advanced countries  will constantly increase, until, at least, 2000." This is a part  of our article in THE ECONOMIST, in its supplement issued in  April 1990.    This quick comparison between the system of government in  Saudi Arabia and its effect on the condition of the Saudi  people, and the system of government in Libya and its effect on  the Libyan people, confirms that the most important element of  the causes of progress and prosperity of any people lies in the  quality of the people's leadership. If God blesses any people  with wise leadership, in which there are ample qualities of  mental acuteness, sincerity, self-sacrifice, long-range  planning, perspicacity, and insight into events, then that  leadership will be able to lead the people along paths of  progress and upper mobility, toward horizons of prosperity and  freedom. The people would sense justice, stability, and  enjoyment of their rights. They would fulfill their national  duty in harmony and satisfaction, increasing their cohesiveness  and confidence in their leadership.    This is what has happened in Saudi Arabia, which God blessed  with wise leadership that has taken the people by the hand to  higher levels, has developed their affairs to a high level in a  short time, and has relied on a constitution derived from the  Koran and the Prophet's sunna and, then, God bestowed the major  oil wealth, which has been used for the benefit of the people.    If leaders are bad and their quality sinks to a level of  ignorance, deception, and irresponsibility, and their rule is  oppressive, not consultative nor democratic, and if they only  rely on hollow slogans to call for the people to close ranks and  mobilize their efforts to combat corruption, expedite  liberation, and catch up with civilized progress, all experience  has proved the failure of those systems to attain the objectives  they call for. On the contrary, those leaders only increase  people's problems, make their problems more complex, make them  poorer, and increase their wretchedness.    I saw what happened in my first country, Libya, at the hands  of the new regime. The people's funds and treasure went up in  smoke. The proteges plunder, and the rest of the people sink  under the burden of poverty, oppression, and need.    This quick comparison contains a warning: systems of  government that God blesses with judicious and wise leadership  steer their people rapidly toward horizons of prosperity,  construction, and progress, in a climate of freedom, justice,  and equality. As for those to whom God has given childish  rulers, ignorant and deceptive, they will lead their people with  hollow slogans toward desolation in poverty, oppression, and  absolutism.    In short, we do not need to imitate the West and its  traditions. In our religion, history, heritage, and values, we  have valuable roots to enable us to devise a Shura system  appropriate for our circumstances and commensurate with our  traditions, which will give us the opportunity of cultural  progress, and economic prosperity in an atmosphere of freedom  and human integrity. This is what King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz,  custodian of the two holy mosques, has done with his recent  declaration about organizing a cabinet and creating the  Consultative Council.    This is a wise and blessed step, and a far-reaching  political  decision, anchored to the fundamentals of an Islamic system of  government. God caused the custodian of the two holy mosques to  be successful in choosing a distinguished elite, those with  correct views, superior intelligence, good reputation, and high  educational qualifications. The Consultative Council, composed  of this chosen elite, reflects the main characteristics of Saudi  society and will easily interact with its aspirations and hopes.  <H3>  `Building of Man Before Building Institutions in Saudi  Arabia,' by Khalid al-Hasan, member of FATAH's Central Committee </H3>   The [formation of the] Consultative Council [Shura],  announced in Saudi Arabia, is a major step forward. It is a  specific leap in the relationship between problems and the  ability to solve them on the desired level. The essential reason  behind that is the multiplicity of qualifications in many of the  people who have become members of the Shura Council.    People qualified in each subject are the first to offer  opinions, concerns, and suggestions concerning the subject that  concerns them, i.e., the doctor in the case of health, teacher  in the case of education, the businessman regarding the economy,  and the judge or Islamic jurist concerning legislation. Then,  discussion takes place through the full council, in order to  crystallize the matter by study and discussion from various  angles. Through a method like this, the superficial and  simplistic in discussing matters can be overcome. Frequently,  ailments befall certain parliaments, so that it is not necessary  for each of those who are elected to have the ability to  participate in specialized debate.    Shura has existed since Islam existed. But, the Islamic  shari'ah did not set the specificity of Shura. Shura was  explained in the Koranic verses: "Consult them in (important)  matters", and "Their affairs are (decided) by council among  themselves." These two basic verses set the relationship between  the ruler [Wali al-Amr] and the people. As for the form of Shura  and its methods, this is left to the people, but within precepts  pertaining to the Islamic revelation and the Islamic milieu.  This is the matter that might require clarification.    Rule in Islamic society is by the shari'ah and not by man.  Compliance with the shari'ah is the focal point of thought in  society. One of the ruler's responsibilities is to supervise  implementation of the shari'ah. After that, but implied in it,  comes Shura. The Consultative Council's mission is to scrutinize  the carrying out of shari'ah laws by the various agencies.    In Islamic history, there was the so-called "Office of  Iniquities." This office was a center and headquarters to look  into disputes between persons or between persons and government,  whether the government was a city or district or regional. The  matter of Shura is ancient, but its forms are multiple. It  develops or changes with the development of society and its  changes. Medina's society, which contained a few thousand  people, could apply Shura there directly and daily, but the  situation is different with a society like Saudi Arabia today,  which contains a number of cities and a population of several  million. Moreover, the situation differs when the matter of  Shura forms in the Islamic world as a whole is studied. Because  of these differences, the shari'ah left the form of Shura to  changing circumstances and situations, on the basis of the  Islamic jurisprudent principle; "Do not disavow changing of  precepts with changing times." Procedural matters might be  changed, but the important thing is that Shura occur and occur  in a sound form. However, the way to apply Shura is left to  circumstances. It must not be a leap from reality, nor a rush to  burn previous stages.    The Arabian Peninsula was nothing but a group of clashing  tribes, before its unification and before the creation of modern  Saudi Arabia under the authority of the late King 'Abd-al-'Aziz  Al Sa'ud. With the beginning of unification, the establishment  of central authority began. In the early days, it was focused on  providing the security that was lacking, and from which  travellers suffered, even the pilgrims at times. It goes without  saying that the establishment of central authority was not done  overnight, and it also need not be mentioned that the matter of  Shura--at that time--had to take an appropriate form for that  stage.    After the reign of the founder, King 'Abd-al-'Aziz, his  successors continued to develop and expand the forms of Shura as  well. Then came the custodian of the two holy mosques, King Fahd  Bin 'Abd-al-'Aziz, during whose reign the kingdom has reached an  extremely advanced state. At this point, I must point out that  Saudi progress is often described as being slow, but I believe  that this slowness was a kind of deliberateness, out of  awareness of the difficulties of the situation, out of a policy  of deliberateness toward change. In this way, change would be  accepted and understood by the people, without convulsions  pushing society toward the unknown. However, this slowness was  crystallized in turn by a social revolution, considered to be  the pearl of revolutions among Third World countries. It is  sufficient to note the development of communications in Saudi  Arabia, from overland roads to airports and railroads. We can  see how that has led to unifying the structure of a tribal  society and facilitating its domestic efficiency, since vast  distances precluded that before. Moreover, a look at development  in building schools, and education in general, from the  elementary stage to girls' education, from seven universities to  academic studies to obtain higher degrees abroad, shows us the  kind of change that occurred in building the Saudi citizen. No  less creative a matter is what happened in health and hospitals,  agriculture and production in an arid desert environment, and  the spread of radio, television, and the press as instruments of  mass communication.    All of these factors join together, shaping Saudi progress,  thanks to the custodian of the two holy mosques, King Fahd  Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, whose share in this progress is especially  distinguished, from overseeing education affairs to running the  kingdom. As a result of this deliberate, gradual and, at the  same time, profound change, it has been possible for Shura to  reach the level of an announcement that the "Consultative  Council" has been formed.    The coming of this council is the result of this stage,  after  most of the manifestations of life in the kingdom have been  developed, and after the Saudi citizen has been developed,  educated and cultured, specialized and committed to his  heritage. Shura came as a result of change, not as an artificial  decree from above. It came as an expression of societal  concepts, which were built through Saudi experience, not as a  means to resolve clashes among suicidal groups, as has happened  in certain experiences of other countries.  <H5>  Election </H5>   I know that there are Western claims circulating about the  matter of elections. They consider elections to be the sole  province of democracy only. We must not fall prisoner to this  kind of moral pressure. In many Third World countries  circumstances have not as yet allowed implementation of the idea  of elections. The concept of elections must be preceded by a  societal concept. This concept only comes through a process of  long-term growth and change in the economic and social  structure. When society is divided into two major tribes for  example, as is the case in certain African countries, and one of  the two is larger than the other, the result of elections--by  virtue of this tribal situation--will be victory for the  candidates of the major tribe and defeat for candidates of the  smaller tribe. This causes various types and forms of civil war,  as is occurring at the present time in Nigeria and Angola.  Elections, in a situation like this, are harmful to the country  concerned that has not yet been prepared for the concept of  elections, or in which elections are merely a form of, or cover  for, the victory of tribal candidates on the basis of tribalism.  Here, the West applauds, because the form has been implemented  without concern for substance. Our goal is not to satisfy the  West, but rather to develop our country. From this premise, we  must discuss our procedures.    As Muslims, we must turn our attention to the substance that  will benefit the citizens, as well as making sure the substance  is harmonious with our Islamic cultural and legal heritage. We  must not merely imitate the West and fall into its secular,  ideological framework.  <H5>  Democracy </H5>   Another question that requires looking into is the question  of democracy. At this point, we must also not fall prisoner to  the moral pressure exercised by the West with regard to this  concept. Democracy is not one idea or one form. Democracy was  born and developed in the West in multiple forms. The West's  positions vis-a-vis democracy are filled with contradictions.  The democracy that started from the Greek ideas, which are the  basis for Western thought, had racist beginnings. Democracy  belonged to the masters who ruled the slaves; Islam rejected  that from the beginning.    Democracy in Israel today is democracy that the West  introduced to it. It is also democracy based on race. The Jew  enjoys democracy; the non-Jew has no right to it, while the  oriental Jew has a reduced kind.    The West today pursues a selective position vis-a-vis  democracy. It demands it in any country if its interests require  it, but ignores a dictatorship in another country if its  interests require. It treats democracy as a means of pressure,  not as a general principle for the good of mankind.    Even democracy in the West has passed through numerous  changes and conditions. Sometimes only landowners may vote.  Sometimes only taxpayers may vote. Sometimes only men and not  women may vote. This matter has not been free from bloody  revolutions en route to democratic change. This confirms the  connection between the idea of democracy and the degree of  social development; it cannot be discussed outside this  framework or in a general way. We should not allow ourselves to  be gripped by an inferiority complex by the use of the word  "democracy" instead of Shura. We must always insist on using the  terminology whose substance is in harmony with our Islamic  culture.  <H5>  Legislation </H5>   We must examine one last subject, which is that many of our  problems in Islamic societies result from our not having applied  laws that have been derived from our Islamic heritage. Instead  of that, we turn to the adoption of Western laws. We must make  an effort to understand what we have, so that we may recognize  that what we have has been valuable all along. We have three  distinguished legislative principles:     -  The first principle is that--basically--matters are  permitted, unless evidence arises to prohibit them. This means  the horizon before us is open.    -  The second principle is that the violation exists with the  rule. If the violation exists, the rule exists, and if the  violation vanishes, the rule vanishes. That is, if the  circumstance changes for which the rule was made, the rule must  be changed.    -  The third principle is that the purpose of the shari'ah is to  prevent the causes of corruption and promote the good, and to  prevent the cause of corruption from gaining advantages.       Principles such as these not only achieve justice, but also  achieve openness, on the basis of not disavowing the changing of  laws with changing times. I only mention that so that I can  stress that our judicial heritage is excellent, rich, and  deep-rooted. Even senior secularist jurists recognize that.  Therefore, we must not be a prisoner to the mentality of  imitating the West. Man is the product of his past, and the past  cannot be annulled, except by our inability to build the future  constructively.  <H3>  `Significance of Decision To Create Saudi Shura Council,' by  Ahmad 'Abbas Salih </H3>   The issue of modernization has been the major topic in Arab  and Islamic societies for more than two centuries. During this  period, it became clear to the Arabs especially that they had  missed the train and that Europe had taken over the situation  and was able to move forward in areas of science and technology.  This gave Europe military and economic power, as well as being  reflected in social concepts and political systems.    The Arabs understood that they must regain the old  situation,  when Arab and Islamic civilization held the reins of progress in  science, technology, and organization. For that purpose, a  number of revolutionary movements were established in the  region. The Ottoman Caliphate was completely worn out, bribery  and corruption were rampant, and culture had degenerated in all  facets of life. This was even reflected in religious tenets and  customs.    The Arabs--in some way--felt that they were responsible for  purifying their religious beliefs of the contamination that was  attached to them. This had resulted in a state of social malaise  and cultural deterioration, leading to the general deterioration  experienced by the region.    Of course, the Arabs thought that they were capable of  carrying out a corrective movement, since they were products of  the cradle of Islam. In fact, a major religious movement, led by  Imam Muhammad Ibn 'Abd-al-Wahhab, was established, aimed at  purifying religious beliefs of the contamination that had seeped  into them, and returning religion to its pure fundamentals. This  was considered the start of a new rational stage, able to  overcome the existing deterioration and catch the train of  progress.    This was not easy. At this time, European expansion was  sweeping the world. It was plucking weak fruit and eating away  at the Ottoman Empire, which was ruling in the name of Islam.  Naturally, Europe was compelled to take into account the  modernization movements in the Arab world. These major powers  were responsible for suppressing and thwarting the modernization  movements.    Nevertheless, the modernization movements were reflected in  various forms from the Maghreb nations to the eastern countries.  In Egypt, a strong modernization movement was led by Imam  Muhammad 'Abdu, which had a connection with what was, at that  time, called the Wahabiyya Movement, especially on the rational  side, which eschewed the superstitions that had been affixed to  the religious beliefs of the Muslim masses. These superstitions  had almost led to a kind of paganism that relied on extreme  backwardness.    Aside from religious modernization movements, there were  feelings of partition and division in the Arab world. The  modernization movement in the Arabian Peninsula was based on two  focal points: religion and political reorganization. The basic  political thought was peninsular unity. The unity would have  been impossible to achieve, were it not for the latent feelings  within the people of the peninsula with regard to the need for  unity and its importance. The idea of modernization imposes  itself, when foreign powers and their domestic allies create  obstacles that oppose it.    Many of the obstacles and subterfuges that reactionary  forces  in Europe used against the modernization movement were borrowed  to block the Arab, Islamic movement. Most of the allegations  that were raised in this regard, either on the Saudi scene or in  other Arab arenas, and some of the erroneous ideas, claimed that  progress and modernity were two Western, Christian processes,  and were anti-Islam. People feared the modernization movements  and created a state of satisfied alienation around themselves,  which led to the belief that adherence to the existing backward  conditions was adherence to the correct religious beliefs.  Therefore, they made Islam to look as if it were against  progress. They invalidated all the brilliant history, in which  Islam led the world--in its glorious ages--to all manner of  progress in thought, philosophy, and pure sciences and  technology.    Therefore, the modernization movement is the fundamental  movement; it is progress itself, escape from backwardness,  ignorance, and subservience. It is the closest to the Islamic  concept, benefiting from the events of history, and from the  flourishing of that call throughout the world and within masses  of its people.    The measurement of progress, the measure of modernization,  is  the basic measure. With this measurement, people can deal  directly with tangible events.    The fact is that Saudi Arabia has benefited from oil  prosperity and from the legacy of the religious and political  modernization movement. It has been able to achieve, through  education, great leaps forward and has changed the nature of the  political composition. After less than 50 years, it has  specialized cadres in all fields. Those who take a look at the  Saudi condition will find that the most prominent manifestation  is the cultural movement. That is expressed through the number  of universities that have been built in a short time, as well as  the revolutionary explosion in the media field, represented  notably by press editions and data communication centers.    Saudi Arabian society has, therefore, gone far beyond the  movement and works hard to absorb many of the movement's  complications resulting from the rapid pace of modernization  processes which, at times, resembles cultural shock.    In situations like these, people must hold on to the land  and  remember their popular roots in arts, crafts, and customs. That  can be expressed in festivals that are held to recall ancient  ways that are rapidly becoming extinct before their eyes, such  as arts, crafts, and popular aesthetics. The [Janadariyah]  festivals are proof of that.    Saudi Arabia is going through what the Japanese society went  through. The rapid Japanese modernization movement was  responsible for many changes in educational, social, and  cultural life in general. The Japanese people had to find sound  ways to avoid the complications of modernization. One of the  most important method was through nostalgia, or feelings of  longing for the past.    The same thing is happening in Saudi Arabia; the flourishing  educational movement understands that and tries to absorb it by  cultural means, by considering its various aspects, and by  comprehensive understanding.    The Consultative [Shura] Council, and the accompanying law  concerning Cabinet responsibilities and work regulations, is a  natural acceleration of the modernization process, complements  previous actions and accomplishments, and responds to its  requirements.    One of the notable matters concerning the new council is the  quality of its members. Those who read the names and know the  details will understand that the Saudi intelligentsia is  entering the decision-making arena, as if it were called to  participate, to be at the heart of the modernization process  that began--in fact--several decades ago. One of its results is  the emergence of this huge number of intellectuals, experts, and  specialists.    Any modernization movement, in any society, requires  foundations and institutions. Saudi Arabia had reached the stage  where its modernization movement needed to expand in terms of  cadres and organizations. The emergence of the institution of  the Shura Council and, then, the Cabinet and the Royal  Secretariat, as well as the media establishment and other  organizations in agriculture, trade, industry, and education, is  clear proof of conditions inside Saudi Arabia and the spread of  a new cultural pattern. The fact is that the Saudi modernization  movement has great historic responsibility. It is proof of  progress in various fields, including expansion in civilizing  institutions, not the destabilizing of previous traditions and  concepts. It has become a movement of major accomplishments, by  which Islam and world Arabs have been enriched.    Fortunately, the material resources and fair distribution of  wealth in Saudi Arabia has greatly decreased the acuteness of  side effects that usually result from the pace of modernization,  and its impact on people and various social forces, which linger  here and there by virtue of their cultural or social  composition. In any event, the modernization movement is not  proceeding in haste, nor at a headlong clip, but rather, it  proceeds--in fact--step by step, practical and reasonable,  understanding the dimensions of the model toward which it is  headed.    Through this practical process, which will open new  horizons,  opportunities and difficulties, successes and failures will  emerge. The mission of the group of the new intelligentsia, and  especially the members of the Shura Council, will be to overcome  all these problems, develop the role of Shura, and participate  effectively in the modernization movement that is in full swing.    A glance at human history in its different transformations  makes it clear that wealth is a basic factor for progress. All  changes in the entire world were the result of having wealth, no  matter what its source. One example could be the emergence of  the importance of commerce to a specific society. Whether  discovering natural wealth, or possessing tremendous scientific,  technical, and psychological capabilities, the society spends it  for progress and expansion.    Wealth is the basis for progress, but wealth alone does not  create progress. The discovery of coal in Britain was the main  reason for its progress and wealth but, aside from that, there  was the constructive will, social desire, and prudent use of  that wealth.    Saudi Arabia has the necessary structure that resurgent  societies rely upon, and it has used that to create an enormous  development process. This process has led to the emergence of  broad population segments of expertise and the institutions  required for progress.    Apart from that, the Saudi people are building on their  extremely important historical glory. It is well known that from  the heart of this land, from a vegetation-less wadi, the  greatest, most magnificent unification movement in the world  began. It changed the face of the land and spread justice,  freedom, and morality. It tore down the rule of false gods and  opened minds to study and discovery. It brought peace and order  to all the land.    The present process of social growth in Saudi Arabia relies  on a splendid heritage, practical reality and, before all, a  wonderful opportunity for maturity. Creating the Shura Council,  and the changes preceding and following this action, is an  indication of the soundness of these trends and the achievement  of aspirations.    Perhaps, this is the simplest significance that the neutral  observer can deduce from this decision.</p>

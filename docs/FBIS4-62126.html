			<p>BFN     [Text] One of the possible Belarusian presidential  candidates, Aleksandr Lukashenko, who led the former  parliamentary commission for combating corruption, told voters  in Gomel: "Belarus's KGB has audio and video tapes which show  that the present Parliament Speaker, Mechyslaw Hryb, had  contacts with representatives of criminal structures."  Lukashenko demanded that the chairman of the State Security  Committee, Gennadiy Lavickiy, "show this material to the public."    In the meantime, Lavickiy told INTERFAX that his committee  "has no such materials," and that Lukashenko's statement "is too  cheap even for a primitive political provocation."    At his meeting with voters in Gomel Lukashenko dismissed the  charges that he opposes the agreement on unifying the Belarusian  monetary system with Russian. "I do not oppose it," he pointed  out. "However the documents on unifying the two monetary systems  are a political show, since Belarus has gained nothing from it  in real terms, and Moscow does not want to speak with the  Belarusian government." According to Lukashenko, "a truly  equitable agreement with Russia can be signed only by his own  team, if he is elected president."</p>

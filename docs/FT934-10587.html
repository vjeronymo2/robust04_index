			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / International Company News: Snapple mixes an explosive fruit cocktail A COMPANY which turns in operating income growth of 230 per cent on revenue growth of 130 per cent should expect to hit the financial headlines. But not when that company is Snapple Beverage, the New York-based fruit juice and iced tea maker. In the 11 months since it went public, the company has become something of a Wall Street legend. Once an obscure regional brand, Snapple has seeped into the American consciousness and on to store shelves, sending sales soaring. It has turned up in the refrigerators of television show characters and featured prominently in this summer's hit film Sleepless in Seattle. A recent fashion section in The New York Times magazine referred to the 'Snapple set . . . who crave exotic juices the way another generation once craved quiche'. According to the Wall Street Journal, the term Snapplesque has entered Wall Street's lexicon as the definition of a stock which is wildly overpriced. The company's stock has performed erratically, trading as high as Dollars 29 7/8 (adjusted for a September stock split) before dropping to Dollars 23. Shares climbed Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 24 5/8 yesterday, after the company posted third-quarter earnings of Dollars 26.9m, or 22 cents a share, up from Dollars 7.8m, or 6 cents, last year on a pro forma basis. The company is planning a secondary offering of 8m post-split shares. Revenues rose to about Dollars 113.7m in the quarter from Dollars 86.9m last year. To put these numbers in perspective, Snapple posted revenues of only Dollars 13.3m for the whole of 1988. In 1991, the year before it went public, revenues had risen to Dollars 95m. Analysts expect revenues of Dollars 400m this year. Snapple's explosive performance has left investors wondering whether the company is another Ben &amp; Jerry's in the making - a company which translated its overnight success into a long-running reliable performance - or whether it is merely flavour of the month, doomed to fall as dramatically as it has risen. The company attributes its strength to 'beverages which appeal to consumers seeking great-tasting, natural products', and Snapple doubtlessly slaking some of the nation's thirst for seemingly healthy non-alcoholic drinks. Sales of these drinks - dubbed New Age beverages by Wall Street analysts - are rocketing. In the ready-to-drink iced teas category alone, sales are expected to climb 70 per cent this year to Dollars 850m, according to some industry experts. Traditionally, Snapple relied on word-of-mouth praise to propel sales, rather than expensive advertising campaigns. This worked when its main market was confined to the New York area. However, it has expanded enormously, and with 52 beverage lines and a presence in every state in the nation, the company is using more mainstream methods of promotion. This year it launched its first national advertising campaign, at an estimated cost of Dollars 30m. Fame has brought Snapple its share of notoriety. In September, the company was forced to run an advertising campaign to quash rumours it supported the Ku Klux Klan, the white supremacist group, and that it endorsed the tactics of Operation Rescue, an anti-abortion group. The KKK rumour is particularly ironic given that Snapple's founders have described themselves as 'three Jewish boys from New York'. In a letter to consumers the company said: 'We are not involved in any way whatsoever with the KKK, Operation Rescue or any other type of pressure group or organisation, period.' Perhaps more worrying are charges that the Food and Drug Administration is looking into Snapple's 'all natural' claim on some of its labels, and the California health services department is questioning the 'brewed' label on its iced teas. Even if these concerns come to naught, the Snapple craze could fizzle out. But for now, US consumers seem to be saying it tastes good enough to keep profits growing.</p>

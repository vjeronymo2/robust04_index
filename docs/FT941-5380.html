			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Observer: Tough emmenthal Attention all double agents - Switzerland is still a safe haven for your undercover earnings. The Swiss government has rejected a request from Washington to freeze the Zurich and Geneva bank accounts of former CIA officer Aldrich Ames and wife Rosario, facing charges in the US of spying for Moscow. The US claims the couple made at least Dollars 2.5m from the Russians. Swiss federal police are not impressed. Spying, they say, is a political, not a criminal offence; so they cannot oblige.</p>

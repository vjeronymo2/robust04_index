			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LIFEGUARD TOWERS WILL GO COMMERCIAL  </P> <P> Commercial advertisements that now appear on lifeguard trucks, phone booths and  trash cans at Los Angeles County beaches soon will adorn lifeguard towers.  </P> <P> County supervisors on Tuesday unanimously approved placing ads on the bottom of  3-by-4-foot chalkboards hung on the sides of 155 lifeguard towers. The boards  advise the public of the times of high and low tides, sunset and temperature.  </P> <P> Beginning in August, the chalkboards will carry a handprint, the logo for a  beachwear company. The county will get $15,000 a year from the contract with  American Marketing Works Inc.  </P> <P> Last month, supervisors decided to allow ads on beachside phone booths. About  6,000 trash cans line county beaches, donated by a radio station. Also,  lifeguard trucks display signs that say "Nissan, official car of the Los  Angeles County beaches."  </P></p>

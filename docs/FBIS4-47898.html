			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by President Gnassingbe Eyadema and Prime </F> Minister Edem Kodjo in Lome; date not given]    [Text] On 3 May at about 2130, some unknown persons  launched a grenade attack on Le Relaxe Restaurant near the Be  District water tower, which is run by a French national. The  grenade was thrown across the fence of the candle-lit restaurant  -- power supply to the area was cut at noon. On the spot  evidence has shown that the grenade was Soviet-made. Six  persons were wounded in the attack which caused some material  damages. The wounded, who were admitted in a private clinic,  include four Frenchmen, one German, and one Beninese trader.    As soon as they were informed, President Gnassingbe Eyadema  and Prime Minister Edem Kodjo gave the necessary instructions to  ensure the best medical attention for the wounded to avoid any  deaths. Presently, two of the six wounded, including the  restaurant owner, have already been discharged. Among the  remaining wounded at the clinic, only one was seriously injured  but he is out of danger.    The president of the Republic and the prime minister  strongly  condemn this cowardly attack which caused injuries to innocent  victims. The investigations they have ordered are continuing  and the perpetrators of this criminal act will, as soon as they  are found, be tried by court and punished according to  prevailing laws.</p>

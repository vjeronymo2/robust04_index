			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Celsis expected to raise up to Pounds 20m in flotation A BIO-SCIENCE company that hopes to replace the 100-year-old agar plate technology for detecting and identifying microbial contamination is due to join the market next month through a placing and intermediaries offer. Celsis has never made a profit and its digital testing product is still in development. But the Cambridge Science Park company is expected to raise up to Pounds 20m and have a market capitalisation of some Pounds 60m. The group will be headed by Mr Tony Martin, chief executive, formerly a director of British Bio-technology, and chaired by Mr John Precious, finance director of Wellcome. The company's founders, Mr Chris Evans and Mr John Morris, will become non-executive directors. Celsis says its system can reduce the time taken to test and identify microbes in medicines, food and cosmetics from up to a week to as little as eight hours. The detection relies on bioluminescence - measurement of light emitted when the firefly luciferase enzyme reacts with Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), which is contained in all living cells. The company will use the net proceeds from the float - Pounds 13.5m if Celsis raises Pounds 20m - for research and development and to set up a marketing team and financial control systems.</p>

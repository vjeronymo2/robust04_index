			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 15 March, the Belarusian Supreme Soviet adopted  the new Belarusian Constitution with 236 "yes" votes, six "no"  votes, and eight abstentions. The major innovation of the  Constitution is that the presidential form of governing is  outlined. It is expected that the election of the first  Belarusian president will take place on 26 June 1994. The final  "touch" added by the Supreme Soviet was an amendment to Article  49 of the Constitution, which guarantees broad and free access  to secondary and vocational education in the Republic. The new  Constitution will come into force immediately after it is  published in the Belarusian press.</p>

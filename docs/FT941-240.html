			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / World News in Brief: Israel and PLO agree on security pact for Hebron Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation said early today they had reached agreement on security arrangements for the West Bank town of Hebron, where an Israeli settler massacred 30 Arabs at prayer in a mosque a month ago. PLO demands for greater security have been holding up implementation of the agreement for Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and the Jericho area of the West Bank. But both sides said these talks could now resume after being suspended since the mosque attack. The PLO said it was agreed there would be international peacekeepers in Hebron but, contrary to expectations, there would be no Palestinian police in the town. More Israelis take hard line, Page 6</p>

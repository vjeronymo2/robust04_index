			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Hungary confirms lead in freeing up telecoms - Nicholas Denton reports on the award of local network concessions to foreign-led partnerships Hungary, in awarding concessions to foreign-led consortia to run local telecoms networks in 15 out of the country's 54 districts, has confirmed its innovative policy in telecommunications. Budapest privatised its national operator and adopted digital mobile networks before most east European countries. In December it sold 30 per cent of Matav, the national telecommunications company, to Deutsche Telecom of Germany and Ameritech of the US for Dollars 875m in eastern Europe's largest privatisation. The local tender further dilutes state control over the telecoms sector. The government granted concessions in four districts to UTS, a partnership of French telecoms equipment manufacturer Alcatel and US Telecom East, a group of US local telecommunications companies. UTS plans to invest Dollars 275m over a decade to build up the number of lines in its regions by the government requirement of 15.5 per cent a year. Two local areas centered on Szeged, Hungary's second-largest city, go to Compagnie Generale des Eaux, the diversified French public utilities group. Other foreign-led consortia have won in another nine regions, with the remaining 39 staying with Matav, the national operator. The authorities have indicated that they are prepared to grant licences for local telephone companies to operate cable television in parallel. Hungary would be the first country after the UK where the regulators have relaxed the barrier between the two, increasingly converging, businesses. Budapest's is a policy of letting 'a hundred flowers bloom', says Mr Henri Piganeau, Hungarian project director for CGE. However, the entry of independents will do little in the short-run for competition. The concessions give the winners exclusive local rights for eight years and do not impinge on Matav's monopoly of trunk and international traffic. Independent operators will take over less than 20 per cent of existing lines, with the majority remaining with Matav. Rivalry with cable television providers will be muted. The telecommunications ministry said that it would grant dual service licences on a case-by-case basis and would take into account the interests of existing cable operators. Nevertheless, CGE for one plans to run fibre-optic cable as close as possible to houses in the expectation of a permit to offer television. The company estimates that cable television services have the potential to add a fifth to the value of the business. When the local monopolies expire, CGE's Mr Piganeau forecasts, strong local operators will begin to raid border areas of neighbouring regions. 'It provides the seeds of future competition,' he says. In the meantime, the independents should be able to lead Matav by example, according to Mr Piganeau. Their performance will provide a benchmark by which to measure the national operator's performance. On balance, analysts say Hungary's liberalisation has probably gone as far as it could without undermining Matav or making the environment so risky as to deter new entrants into the market. 'Hungary is really leading the way on this one,' says Mr James Roberson of United Telecom Services. Hungary is an unlikely telecommunications pioneer. The telephone network, with just 7 lines per 100 inhabitants, was the most sparse in the Soviet bloc even though its communist neighbours hardly set exacting standards. But in some races there are advantages to coming from behind: in the drive to develop modern telecommunications, eastern Europe - and particularly Hungary - is demonstrating that backwardness has its compensations. The growing strain on state finances, far from limiting development, has pushed Budapest to liberalise and attract private finance. The auction of local concessions raised a useful Ft8.2bn (Pounds 54m) for the government and attracted commitments from foreign consortia to invest Ft20bn in the first three years. Low line-density, still only 15 per 100 compared with a west European average of 43, provided the political impetus to invite in independent local operators. Long waiting lists for phones have made Matav one of Hungary's most unpopular companies and fuelled demands by many communities for more responsive local operators. Local authorities criticise Matav for putting the trunk network and businesses above provision of new lines for ordinary households. 'That's what happens when you have King Kong calling all the shots,' says Mr Roberson. The inadequacy of communist telecommunications regulation freed regulators to tear up past laws and fashion the 1993 telecoms act around modern technology and the new possibilities of competition. All in all, Hungary has offered a classic example of what telecoms analysts call the 'leapfrog' - the ability of countries with backward networks to jump over a whole stage of telecoms development. Hungary's neighbours, which start even further back, have a similar opportunity. The independents certainly hope so. UTS says it is looking at other east European countries and CGE believes its operations in south-eastern Hungary could provide a springboard for expansion into neighbouring Romania and even Serbia.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 19 KYODO -- Kenzo Yoneda, a House of  Representatives member of the main opposition Liberal Democratic  Party (LDP), quit the party Tuesday [19 April] making him the  12th defector from the LDP since last Friday.    Yoneda, who belonged to the faction led by former Foreign  Minister Michio Watanabe, said he "cannot act freely inside the  faction."    Yoneda said he plans to team up with a group of five LDP  defectors who quit the party Monday.    The five defectors backed Watanabe in his bid for the  premiership. Watanabe formally gave up the bid Tuesday.    Another five LDP lower house legislators quit the party last  Friday and formed a new party called New Party Mirai (Future) on  Monday.    Another LDP lower house member, Kenji Kosaka, left the party  Monday.    Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], the coalition's core party  formed by LDP defectors last summer and led by Foreign Minister  Tsutomu Hata, agreed in an executive meeting Tuesday to the  entry of Kosaka, independent lower house member Shigeru Ishiba  and House of Councillors member Hiroko Hayashi, a former LDP  member, party officials said.    Hata, also deputy prime minister, is regarded as a most  likely successor to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa who has  announced he is resigning to take responsibility for his  controversial personal finance deals.    The LDP had been in power for 38 years until last August  when  it was ousted by Hosokawa's coalition after a general election  the previous month.</p>

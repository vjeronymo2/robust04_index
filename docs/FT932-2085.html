			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Licensing deal for Leyland supplier MOTOR PANELS, a subsidiary of the specialist engineering company Mayflower, has reached a licensing agreement with Leyland Trucks Manufacturing to market the Ley-land cab range outside west Europe. The Mayflower subsidiary is one of the most important suppliers to the newly formed Leyland Trucks Manufacturing, which was acquired as a management buy-out from the receiver two weeks ago following the financial collapse earlier this year of Daf, the Dutch commercial vehicle maker, and Leyland Daf its UK subsidiary. Motor Panels supplies the cabs for the present truck ranges produced at the plant in Leyland, Lancashire, including the 45-series of light trucks. Under the exclusive licensing agreement Motor Panels will be able to produce the cabs for customers outside west Europe and for other specific Leyland Truck Manufacturing markets. In parallel with the formation of Leyland Trucks, Motor Panels has signed a new five-year contract with the company to supply cabs with a value estimated initially at about Pounds 20m over the life of the deal.</p>

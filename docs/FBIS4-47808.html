			<p>BFN     [Text] Kigali, May 3 (AFP) -- Heavy mortar fire rocked the  Rwandan capital Kigali on Tuesday [3 May] as rebel leaders and  government ministers gathered in Tanzania where the United  Nations is trying to bring them to the negotiating table.    The headquarters of the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF)  in  east Kigali came under heavy fire from government forces, said  Abdul Kabia, executive director of the UN Assistance Mission in  Rwanda (UNAMIR).    The rebels returned fire from different parts of the  capital,  targeting a military camp in the south-east and other government  positions in the south, said Kabia, speaking by telephone from  Kigali.    An international official in Kigali said the rebels,  surrounding Kigali, "could take the city any time they want."    RPF chairman Alexis Kanyarengwe and the interim government's  Transport Minister Andre Ntagerura meanwhile held separate talks  with Tanzanian mediators and UN officials in the northern  Tanzanian town of Arusha, a UN official said.    UN envoy to Rwanda Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh said he would try  to persuade the rebels to open face-to-face talks with the  interim government, which they do not recognise.    But Tanzanian officials said they were "not optimistic" that  the rebels would agree to talk with the government, which they  have branded "a clique of killers."    The rebels said earlier that their leaders' mission in  Arusha  was limited to briefing Tanzanian officials on their position in  the Rwandan conflict.    But the rebels have agreed to meet military officers to  discuss ways of halting the carnage in Rwanda, which has cost  more than 100,000 lives since the death of president Juvenal  Habyarimana in an April 6 rocket attack on his plane rekindled  the war and plunged the tiny central African country into chaos.    "We hope that the military men in both delegations will  agree  to meet," Booh-Booh told AFP by telephone.    Ten days ago Tanzania failed to organise an earlier round of  talks, also in Arusha where the rebels and government signed  peace accords last August to end a three-year civil war.    Rwanda's bloodbath has sparked a massive refugee exodus.  Between a quarter and half a million Rwandans poured across the  border to Tanzania last week.    The rebels are mainly from the minority Tutsi tribe which  has  borne the brunt of the slaughter, while the government is  predominantly from the majority Hutu group.    Refugees in Tanzania said both government forces and rebels  had massacred civilians.    UN troops trying to evacuate about 300 terrified Rwandan  civilians from a Kigali hotel were delayed by mortar fire and  small arms exchanges, Kabia said.    The civilians, mainly Tutsis, had been pinned down for weeks  by fighting.    UN soldiers evacuated 11 foreigners from Kigali to the  Kenyan  capital Nairobi on Monday. Most foreigners were evacuated weeks  ago.    UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali meanwhile stepped  up  his campaign to persuade African nations to send a large  peacekeeping force to Rwanda, diplomats said.    The United States, which has pledged 15 million dollars in  aid for Rwanda, says it will also help finance an international  military intervention.    But no Western countries have offered troops.    The United Nations slashed its force in Rwanda from 2,500 to  270 last month after 10 Belgian peacekeepers were killed.</p>

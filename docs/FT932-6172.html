			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / UK Company News: East Surrey moves ahead to Pounds 5.7m East Surrey Holdings, the water, property and building supplies group, lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 5.54m to Pounds 5.7m in the year to March 31. Mr John Fooks, the chairman, said that on the water side the company suffered a 7 per cent decline in metered consumption, mainly because of the recession. In its non-regulated activities performance had been below expectations because of the effects of a depressed economy. Turnover amounted to Pounds 23.8m (Pounds 21.9m) with unmeasured water supplies at Pounds 16.6m (Pounds 15.9m), measured water supplies at Pounds 5.37m (Pounds 5.26m) and other activities at Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 685,000). The pre-tax result was after net interest payable of Pounds 1.01m (Pounds 982,000). Earnings were little changed at 38.8p (38.7p). A proposed final dividend of 7.36p (6p) lifts the total to 11.46p (9.56p).</p>

Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina on 17 February began massive  removal of cannons and other heavy weaponry from Sarajevo. At a  meeting with UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi on 18 February,  Serbian leader Karadzic assured Akashi that the heavy weapons  deployed around Sarajevo will be placed under the effective  supervision of UN peacekeeping forces before midnight 19  February.    Muslim forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina have also agreed to turn  over heavy weaponry to the supervision of UN peacekeeping troops  by the same deadline, and have already taken action to do so.    According to reports, the change in the Serbs' stand has to  do with Russia's active mediation. After a meeting on 15  February with visiting British Prime Minister Major, who had  gone to Moscow on a "persuasion mission," President Yeltsin  explicitly told reporters that Russia could not be excluded from  mediation in the Bosnia-Herzegovina question. President  Yeltsin's special envoy Churkin had over the past few days  continuously conducted mediations among all conflicting parties.  On 17 February, Churkin and Karadzic reached agreement that on  the condition that Russia dispatch 800 blue-helmet troops to  Bosnia-Herzewgovina, the Serbian armed forces would remove all  heavy weaponry surrounding Sarajevo.    Russia has consistently taken a tough stance on NATO's  ultimatum. A careful study yields three factors behind the  Russian stance. First, Russia is extremely unhappy with the way  the Western countries have bypassed the UN Security Council --  in fact, Russia -- in directly issuing the ultimatum to  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Second, since Russia has always maintained  traditional ties with the Slavic-speaking Serbs, abandoning the  Serbs at a crucial moment is tantamount to forsaking Russian  interests in the Balkan region. Third, a NATO air strike on  Bosnia-Herzegovina would mean the first military operation  conducted by the organization in the past 44 years since its  inauguration; and to Russia, this is no different from  recognizing the eastward thrust of NATO's defense line, which  will seriously undermine Russia's strategic interests.    In the wake of the Serbs' 17 February announcement  consenting  to withdrawal of heavy weapons, German Chancellor Kohl has  appealed to all concerned that before the deadline of NATO's  ultimatum, every opportunity should be taken to seek a political  settlement, which British Prime Minister Major has said may  avert NATO's possible air strikes. Belgian Vice Prime Minister  Claes has urged the United States and Russia to work together to  seek a peaceful settlement of the Bosnia-Herzegovina question.  France and the United States have expressed cautious optimism,  while emphasizing that as far as the Serbs are concerned, it is  necessary to "hear what they say and watch what they do" and to  adopt a "wait-and-see" attitude. U.S. President Clinton has  again sounded a warning 17 February that should the Serbs fail  to hand over heavy weapons before the deadline, NATO will take  its air raid plan "extremely seriously." French Foreign Ministry  spokesman DeKay [name as published] stressed on the evening of  17 February that the Serbs "should meet all the conditions set  in the NATO ultimatum."    Reportedly the NATO ultimatum, which was proposed by France,  is aimed at ending the war and bringing about peace through  exerting pressure on France's neighbor as soon as possible to  reverse the stalemate situation in spite of the EC states'  energetic mediation; it is also aimed at paving the way for  France to regain its status as a political power. To this end,  France abandoned the UN banner, which it had consistently upheld  in the past, and proposed a direct NATO ultimatum to  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Meanwhile, France has also realized that  armed settlement can only be the "last resort," and has strived  to resolve the crisis and seek political settlement within the  scope of a joint action by the EC, the United States, and Russia.    It is understood that the foreign ministers of Russia,  Germany, Greece, and Belgium and EC officials concerned held a  joint meeting in Athens 18 February to continue the search for a  peaceful settlement of the Bosnia-Herzegovina question.    In another development, UN special envoy to former  Yugoslavia  Aikxy [name as published] held "useful talks" with Muslim leader  Izetbegovic in Sarajevo 18 February. Beginning 19 February, UN  peacekeeping forces will inspect the vicinity of Sarajevo and  examine the removal of heavy weaponry by the Serbs and Muslims.  A NATO spokesman declared on 18 February that before the  complete withdrawal of the Serbs' heavy weaponry, NATO's  determination to conduct air strikes on Bosnia-Herzegovina  remains unchanged. It is understood that the defense ministers  of the United States, Britain, France, Italy, and the  Netherlands will meet at Italy's Aweiyanuo [name as published]  Air Base 20 February to make the final decision on air strikes.</p>

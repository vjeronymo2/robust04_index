			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- The aggregate value of  personal assets of ministers in Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's  cabinet is 2.4 times that of the cabinet of his predecessor,  Morihiro Hosokawa, according to KYODO NEWS SERVICE calculations  based on figures announced by the ministers.    The political offices of Hata and his 20 ministers, as well  as former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano who quit the cabinet  over an outcry following his remarks contradicting Japan's  wartime atrocities, announced their asset values on Tuesday [31  May] in line with a decade-long custom in Japan's political  community.    The Hata administration became the 14th administration to  reveal the asset values of its cabinet ministers in accordance  with the custom initiated by the 1984 cabinet of Prime Minister  Yasuhiro Nakasone amid public pressure on politicians to clarify  their personal finances.    The total of the voluntarily-disclosed value of land and  other fixed asset property, stock and bond holdings and bank  savings held by the ministers stood at 3.22 billion yen,  according to the self- assessment.    However, these figures -- calculated on the basis of the  face  value of stock and a special official format used in the  calculation of tax amounts -- do not reflect the realities of  the land and stock market.    The real aggregate value of the assets of Hata's ministers  amounts to 13.33 billion yen, according to the KYODO  calculations.    The aggregate asset value of the Hata cabinet turned out to  be more than double that of the Hosokawa cabinet, as Hata and  nine other ministers are former defectors from the Liberal  Democratic Party who used to draw their financial strength from  cash-heavy corporate contributors, political analysts said.    The aggregate assets held by the 10 former LDP rebels and  held in the names of their family members accounted for 13.4  billion yen or 88 percent of the 15.26 billion yen held by the  21 cabinet ministers and their families.    The asset value of the Hosokawa cabinet was unusually low in  comparison with previous administrations, partly because several  Social Democratic Party legislators were incorporated into the  cabinet lineup.    These SDP cabinet ministers stormed out of Hata's ruling  coalition on April 26 after coalition strategists suddenly  formed a unified parliamentary voting bloc excluding the SDP in  the House of Representatives.    Labor Minister Kunio Hatoyama, a former LDP veteran, topped  the list of ministers as the most wealthy minister with his  KYODO- assessed asset value coming to 8.46 billion yen.  Hatoyama is now an independent.    His stock holdings accounted for 5.77 billion yen, while his  savings stood at 1.75 billion yen. The remaining portion  comprises his real estate, and golf club membership certificates  at five country clubs that could be cashed at any time.    Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, another ex-LDP rebel who  joined Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], ranked second with 875  million yen, followed by Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa 542  million yen.    Kakizawa's real estate value provides an example of a gulf  between the self-assessed value and the real market value.    The self-declared value of his Tokyo home, office and  residential land stood at 38 million yen, while their market  value came to 533 million yen, according to the KYODO probe.    The premier himself ranked 13th in the list with his asset  value totaling 150 million yen. This compares with Hosokawa's  1.3 billion yen. One of the conspicuous features of his asset  makeup was his investment in overseas investment trusts.    The latest announcement by the premier's office disclosed  that he failed to report in 1993 debts of 70 million yen when he  declared his asset value when serving as foreign minister in the  Hosokawa administration.    The Hata administration initially proposed to media  organizations that Hata and six other cabinet ministers who held  cabinet posts in the previous Hosokawa administration be spared  the obligation to declare their asset values.    The administration withdrew the proposal after it came under  criticism for an alleged attempt to neglect the obligation to  show public transparency regarding their personal finances.    Political analysts said the loopholes in the reporting  requirement should be plugged in order to enable the public to  assess the real situation concerning the personal finances of  politicians.    The requirement cannot clarify the process of personal  asset-  amassing, such as Hosokawa's controversial purchase of 300  shares in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. which he said he  helped his father-in-law buy by pledging as collateral the  condominium he purchased with a 100 million yen loan from a  scandal-ridden trucking group, they said.</p>

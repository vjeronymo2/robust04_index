			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Institute of Economic Affairs Conference on Regulation: Byatt likely to support calls for water meters MR IAN BYATT, director-general of Ofwat, the water industry regulator, yesterday gave the strongest hint yet that he plans to recommend a form of water metering as the main conclusion of his review of paying for water. Mr Byatt said tariffs for water should be reformed to reflect more accurately the amount people use. That would reduce the proportion of water bills accounted for by a standing charge to cover connection to the water system. A change in the way people pay for water is part of Mr Byatt's increasingly ambitious plans to reform the industry. He also intends to review the costs of capital for water companies and the rate of return they are expected to make. These are vital factors in setting price controls. He told the conference consumer choice should be an important objective of pricing policy. The opportunity to economise on an increasingly expensive commodity would become more important for people on low incomes, while there should be no restriction on people using a lot of water if they were prepared to pay for it. Mr Byatt will this autumn make recommendations on how the price structure and method of charging for water should be reformed. Standing charges are currently linked to the rateable value of property. Ofwat is planning a series of surveys of consumer preferences and expectations which Mr Byatt said could have far reaching implications for the structure of the industry.</p>

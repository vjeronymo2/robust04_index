			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Description of Amendment Request:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This amendment is an additional followup  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the amendment request of May 29, 1992, published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on July 8, 1992 (57 FR 30242), which changed the Technical Specifications &sect;1.0, Definitions, to accommodate a 24-month fuel cycle and which proposed the extension of the test intervals for specific surveillance tests. This amendment proposes extending the surveillance intervals to 24 months for the following additional surveillance tests: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Analog Rod Position Indication.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Plant Noble Gas Activity Monitor (R&hyph;44).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Low Turbine Auto Stop Oil Pressure Reactor Trip.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) 6.9 KV Undervoltage Relays.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Boric Acid Tank Level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Vapor Containment Sump Discharge Flow and Temperature Channel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Loss of Power Undervoltage and Degraded Voltage Relays.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) Over-pressurization Protection System (OPS) and Control Rod  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Protection System (for use with Low Parasite [LOPAR] fuel) Trip.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) Condenser Evacuation System Activity Monitor (R&hyph;45).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (10) Service Water Inlet Temperature Monitoring Instrumentation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (11) Sampler Flow Rate Monitors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (12) Boric Acid Makeup Flow System.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (13) Plant Vent Noble Gas Effluent Monitor (R&hyph;27). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The amendment also proposes to change the surveillance interval for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Refueling Water Storage Tank Level to quarterly and to change the trip  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> setpoint for the Control Rod Protection System. The changes requested by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the licensee are in accordance with Generic Letter 91&hyph;04, ``Changes in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Technical Specification Surveillance Intervals to Accommodate a 24&hyph;Month  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fuel Cycle.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basis for Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> [(1) Analog Rod Position Indication:]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration since:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. A significant increase in the probability or consequences of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accident previously evaluated will not occur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is proposed that the channel calibration frequency for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analog rod position indication channel be changed from every 18  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> months (+25%) to every 24 months (+25%).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A statistical analysis of channel uncertainty for a 30 month  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating cycle has been performed. Based upon this analysis it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has been concluded that none of the major error contributors are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time dependent and that it can be reasonably expected that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> channel will remain within calibration tolerance over a possible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 30 month operating cycle. In addition, the rod bottom bistable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is subject to monthly testing which would detect any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> abnormalities in an extended operating cycle. Due to this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monthly test and the acceptable past test history, it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concluded that the channel will continue to operate within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tolerance over an extended operating cycle and will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contribute to a significant increase in the probability or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consequences of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accident previously evaluated has not been created.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change in operating cycle length due to an increased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveillance interval is not expected to affect the ability of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the instrument channel to remain within calibration tolerance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, the rod position indicator is used in normal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation only as an aid in control rod movement. Normally, very  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> little control rod movement occurs during normal operation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, it is not relied upon for accident prevention or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accident mitigation. In accordance with existing Technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifications, normal operation can continue even if one channel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is inoperable because alternate means (core instrumentation)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exists to monitor rod position. The frequent monthly test tends  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to minimize the effect of a longer operating cycle for the rod  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> position indication channel as any malfunction induced by time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be detected. Thus, it is concluded that the possibility of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluated has not been created.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. A significant reduction in a margin of safety is not involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A statistical analysis of past calibration data has not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identified any time dependent error contributors. Also, past  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test data indicates that the channel remains within calibration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tolerance over the existing operating cycle. A longer operating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cycle would increase the risk of drift, however accuracy is not a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prime requirement for the RPI. Therefore, it is concluded that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> longer operating cycle will not result in a significant reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in a margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [(2) Plant Noble Gas Activity Monitor (R&hyph;44):]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration since:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. There is no significant increase in the probability or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consequences of an accident.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is proposed that the channel calibration frequency for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Plant Noble Gas Activity Monitor (R&hyph;44) be changed from every 18  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> months (+25%) to every 24 months (+25%).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The function of R&hyph;44 is to respond to high activity levels during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> normal operation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The setpoint for R&hyph;44 is established sufficiently above the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected radioactivity level in the discharge stream to preclude  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> false actions but sufficiently below the allowed discharge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> radioactivity concentration so that discharge in excess of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permissible limits does not occur. Monitor readouts are not used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for quantitative purposes, but are used to respond to relative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes in radioactivity concentration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There is limited data to support an unqualified extension of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveillance interval. However, the instrument is checked for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operability prior to release. Should the instrument be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inoperable releases may continue provided grab sample analysis is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performed. Since the monitor is subject to daily channel checks,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monthly source checks, and quarterly functional channel tests,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> abnormal instrument behavior or inoperability would be detected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permitting corrective actions during the extended surveillance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously analyzed has not been created.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Operability of the instrument is important rather than ability to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintain a specific setpoint. Operability of the instrument is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> verified prior to a planned discharge and this is independent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an extended surveillance cycle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] International diplomats are meeting in Bonn today to  discuss ways of extending the cease-fire in Sarajevo to the  various Bosnian towns besieged by the Serbs. The United Nations  is counting on the effective reopening of Tuzla Airport, on 7  March for example. NATO may be called upon for close air  support. For Alain Juppe, another ultimatum is not at all  necessary in order to undertake this operation:    [Begin Juppe recording] Ultimatums are fine, but they should  not be set every day, because they are then difficult to  enforce. I neither confirm nor deny that date [7 March],  because it falls within UNPROFOR's [UN Protection Forces] remit.  I think the United Nations instigated it; the question should  be put to them.    As for Tuzla, we have legal grounds should we want to  intervene, and I would like to remind you that we have legal  grounds should we want to resort to force. We do not need any  other decision. What is it all about? You know very well: We  are in a town that is in the Muslim zone and under Serb guns.  We say: We need a new airport so planes carrying out a  humanitarian airlift can land in this region, which is in a very  difficult position. For this to happen, it is necessary for the  Serbs not to threaten shelling. What we want to do is to set up  a ground control system that will enable planes to land. We say  quite clearly: Should Serb batteries hinder this, they will be  destroyed. This is why there is no need for an ultimatum,  because it is all there, in the documents. [end recording]</p>

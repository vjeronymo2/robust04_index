Haitian Ambassador to the United Nations Fritz  Longchamp confirmed on 18 January that the international  community is considering increasing the sanctions. This  decision was made after the failure of the talks with the  military for relaunching the application of the Governors Island  accord. Rothschild Francois, Junior reports:    [Begin Francois recording] We are perhaps moving toward the  reinforcement of the sanctions against Haiti, most likely this  week. Haitian UN Ambassador Fritz Longchamp has this information  to us here in Miami. Fritz Longchamp was not able to specify  for us the nature of those sanctions. However some UN sources,  which prefer to remain anonymous, indicate that an air embargo  could be ordered against Haiti. Other UN sources indicate that  nothing has yet been decided on the question. A meeting of the  Security Council should be held this week, as the 15 January  deadline for the Haitian military to apply the Governor Island  accord has passed. [passage omitted].    It should be pointed out that President-in-exile  Jean-Bertrand Aristide is due to travel to Canada on 23 January.  On 24 January, he is due to meet with the new head of the  Canadian government, Mr. Jean Chretien.    This has been Rothschild Francois, Junior, in Miami for  Radio  Metropole. [end recording]</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> H.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Siting Away From Densely Populated Centers. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Population density considerations beyond the exclusion area have been required since issuance of part 100 in 1962. The current rule requires a ``low population zone'' (LPZ) beyond the immediate exclusion area. The LPZ boundary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must be of such a size that an individual located at its outer boundary must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not receive a dose in excess of the values given in part 100 over the course  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the accident. While numerical values of population or population density  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are not specified for this region, the regulation also requires that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nearest boundary of a densely populated center of about 25,000 or more persons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be located no closer than one and one-third times the LPZ outer boundary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part 100 has no population criteria other than the size of the LPZ and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proximity of the nearest population center, but notes that ``where very large  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cities are involved, a greater distance may be necessary.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Whereas the exclusion area size is based upon limitation of individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risk, population density requirements serve to set societal risk limitations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and reflect consideration of accidents beyond the design basis, or severe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accidents. Such accidents were clearly a consideration in the original  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issuance of part 100, since the Statement of Considerations (27 FR 3509; April  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12, 1962) noted that:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Further, since accidents of greater potential hazard than those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commonly postulated as representing an upper limit are conceivable,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> although highly improbable, it was considered desirable to provide for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection against excessive exposure doses to people in large centers,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where effective protective measures might not be feasible *&blank;*&blank;*. Hence, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> population center distance was added as a site requirement. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Limitation of population density beyond the exclusion area has the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefits:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) It facilitates emergency preparedness and planning; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) It reduces potential doses to large numbers of people and reduces  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> property damage in the event of severe accidents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the Commission's Safety Goal policy provides guidance on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual risk limitations, in the form of the Quantitative Health Objectives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (QHO), it provides no guidance with regard to societal risk limitations and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore cannot be used to ascertain whether a particular population density  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would meet the Safety Goal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, results of severe accident risk studies, particularly those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtained from NUREG&hyph;1150, can provide useful insights for considering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential criteria for population density. Severe accidents having the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> highest consequences are those where core-melt together with early bypass of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or containment failure occurs. Such an event would likely lead to a ``large  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> release'' (without defining this precisely). Based upon NUREG&hyph;1150, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> probability of a core-melt accident together with early containment failure or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bypass for some current generation LWRs is estimated to be between 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> ^5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> ^6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  per reactor year. For future plants, this value is expected to be less than 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> ^6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  per reactor year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a reactor was located nearer to a large city than current NRC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practice permitted, the likelihood of exposing a large number of people to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant releases of radioactive material would be about the same as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> probability of a core-melt and early containment failure, that is, less than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> ^6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  per reactor year for future reactor designs. It is worth noting that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> events having the very low likelihood of about 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> ^6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  per reactor year or lower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been regarded in past licensing actions to be ``incredible'', and as such,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have not been required to be incorporated into the design basis of the plant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hence, based solely upon accident likelihood, it might be argued that siting a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reactor nearer to a large city than current NRC practice would pose no undue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If, however, a reactor were sited away from large cities, the likelihood  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the city being affected would be reduced because of two factors. First,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because the wind is expected to blow in all directions with roughly the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frequency, the likelihood that radioactive material would actually be carried  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> towards the city is reduced significantly because it is likely that the wind  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will blow in a direction away from the city. Second, the radiological dose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consequences would also be reduced with distance because the radioactive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material becomes increasingly diluted by the atmosphere and the inventory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> becomes depleted due to the natural processes of fallout and rainout before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reaching the city. Analyses indicate that if a reactor were located at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distances ranging from 10 to about 20 miles away from a city, depending upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its size, the likelihood of exposure of large numbers of people within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> city would be reduced by factors of ten to one hundred or more compared with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> locating a reactor very close to a city.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In summary, next-generation reactors are expected to have risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characteristics sufficiently low that the safety of the public is reasonably  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assured by the reactor and plant design and operation itself, resulting in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> very low likelihood of occurrence of a severe accident. Such a plant can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfy the QHOs of the Safety Goal with a very small exclusion area distance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (as low as 0.1 miles). The consequences of design basis accidents, analyzed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using revised source terms and with a realistic evaluation of engineered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety features, are likely to be found acceptable at distances of 0.25 miles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or less. With regard to population density beyond the exclusion area, siting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a reactor closer to a densely populated city than is current NRC practice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would pose a very low risk to the populace.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nevertheless, the Commission considers that defense-in-depth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considerations and the additional enhancement in safety to be gained by siting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reactors away from densely populated centers should be maintained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission is proposing a two-tier approach with regard to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> population density and reactor sites. The proposed rule states that reactor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sites should be located away from very densely populated centers, and that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas of low population density are, generally, preferred. The Commission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that a site not falling within these two categories, although not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preferred, could be found acceptable under certain conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission is not establishing specific numerical criteria for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluation of population density in siting future reactor facilities because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the acceptability of a specific site from the standpoint of population density  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must be considered in the overall context of safety and environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considerations. The Commission's intent is to assure that a site that has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant safety, environmental or economic advantages is not rejected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solely because it has a higher population density than other available sites.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Population density is but one factor that must be balanced against the other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advantages and disadvantages of a particular site in determining the site's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptability. Thus, it must be recognized that sites with higher population  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> density, so long as they are located away from very densely populated centers,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can be approved by the Commission if they present advantages in terms of other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considerations applicable to the evaluation of proposed sites.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On April 28, 1977, Free Environment, Inc. et al., filed a petition for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking (PRM&hyph;50&hyph;20) requesting, among other things, that ``the central Iowa  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nuclear project and other reactors be sited at least 40 miles from major  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> population centers.'' The petitioner also stated that ``locating reactors in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sparsely-populated areas *&blank;*&blank;* has been endorsed in non-binding NRC guidelines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for reactor siting.'' The petitioner did not specify what constituted a major  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> population center. The only NRC guidelines concerning population density in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regard to reactor siting are in Regulatory Guide 4.7, issued in 1974, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised in 1975, prior to the date of the petition. This guide states  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> population density values of 500 persons per square mile out to a distance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 30 miles from the reactor, not 40 miles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

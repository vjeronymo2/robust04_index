			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRODUCERS MADE LIABLE IN GUN DEATHS;  </P> <P> FIREARMS: NEW D.C. LAW ALSO SUBJECTS SELLERS OF ASSAULT WEAPONS TO DAMAGE  SUITS. NRA SAYS IT WON'T HOLD UP IN COURT. A VETO BY CONGRESS IS POSSIBLE.  </P> <P> In the most far-reaching gun control action ever taken in the United States,  District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry announced Tuesday that he had signed a  bill that makes manufacturers and sellers legally liable for deaths and  injuries caused by the most fearsome assault weapons.  </P> <P> "We don't need these guns on the street," the outgoing mayor said. The measure  had been passed last week by the City Council.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the National Rifle Assn. accused the city government of "cheap  theatrics" and predicted that the measure will not stand up in court.  </P> <P> Under a special review process that applies only to District of Columbia laws,  Congress may veto the controversial gun control measure. Advocates and  opponents both braced for a major fight on Capitol Hill when the new Congress  convenes next month.  </P> <P> "These weapons are so dangerous that the manufacturers and dealers have to know  they are going to be used to kill people," said Michael Beard, president of the  Coalition to Stop Handgun Violence.  </P> <P> Richard Gardiner, NRA director of state and local affairs, retorted, "The whole  concept of punishing the innocent manufacturer, who has no control over the  sale of a gun, for the act of a criminal flies in the face of everything we've  developed in the common law for six centuries."  </P> <P> Backers of the bill said that, even if Congress disapproves the legislation and  President Bush agrees to kill the measure, it still may serve as a model for  other cities that are plagued by drug-related murders, such as Los Angeles, New  York and Detroit.  </P> <P> However, Gardiner said that laws in 39 states prevent cities from passing any  firearms legislation.  </P> <P> In 1987, California enacted a law requiring owners of most assault weapons to  register them or face fines and criminal penalties.  </P> <P> Although it already has one of the stiffest gun control laws on the books,  Washington has the highest homicide rate in the nation, with a record 465  murders so far this year. District of Columbia police say that nearly all of  the guns used in crimes here were brought into the city from neighboring  Maryland or Virginia, where gun laws are far less stringent.  </P> <P> The new legislation would allow private citizens to file lawsuits for damages  against the makers and sellers of fast-firing Street Sweepers, AK-47s, Uzis and  similar assault weapons.  </P> <P> Congress does not interfere frequently with the D.C. City Council's actions,  but once measures become controversial they usually are turned down.  </P> <P> Under the review procedure, opponents of the new gun law will have to move  within 30 legislative days to get a resolution of disapproval through both the  House and Senate and then get President Bush to sign it.  </P> <P> Supporters of the law hope to bottle it up in the District of Columbia  Committee, headed by Rep. Ronald V. Dellums (D-Berkeley), who is usually a  strong proponent of home rule for Washington.  </P> <P> "From a legislative perspective, (supporters of the bill) have the advantage,  and it's a significant advantage," said a spokesman for Sen. Dennis DeConcini  (D-Ariz.).  </P> <P> But Richard Dykema, chief adviser to Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Long Beach),  predicted that Congress will overturn the law.  </P> <P> "The city of Washington has far overstepped its bounds in trying to put gun  (firms that) make assault weapons out of business," Dykema said. "I don't think  Congress would let anybody get away with it -- even a state.  </P> <P> Rohrabacher, a member of the House District of Columbia Committee, was  traveling in the Middle East and could not be reached for comment.  </P></p>

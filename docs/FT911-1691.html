			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Food supply for 1m in Ethiopia enough for just 10 days FOOD STOCKS for over 1m people in Ethiopia will be exhausted in ten days, the British charity Oxfam said yesterday, warning that without fresh supplies the country's death toll would exceed the 1984 famine, Michael Holman, Africa Editor writes. 'What I have seen has shaken me. It is even worse than I expected. The suffering is already acute,' said Mr Frank Judd, Oxfam director who is on a fact finding mission to Ethiopia, where civil wars threaten the government of President Haile Mariam Mengistu. 'The dying could soon overshadow that of 1984 unless action is taken immediately. The priorities are obvious: food, transport, water, medical supplies and shelter.' Around 1m Ethiopians are estimated to have died in the 1984-85 famine. Accusing leading donors of 'dragging their feet', an Oxfam statement said that only half the total food needs of Ethiopia for the year has been pledged, and much less than that have been delivered by the main donors. The European Community was still debating ways to fund 400,000 tonnes of food aid which had been agreed to in principle 'more than two weeks ago', said the charity. In the west of the country there is only 14 days' food left for 300,000 refugees from Sudan, and in the northern Ogaden region, at least 500,000 Somali refugees have only 14 days supply left. A further 200,000 Ethiopians who have returned from Ethiopia are also facing 'severe shortages', while relief efforts for 380,000 drought victims in southern Ogaden are 'severely hampered by appalling road conditions.' In the region of north Omo, 400,000 people 'are facing starvation' due to crop failure, and the number is expected to almost double, says Oxfam.</p>

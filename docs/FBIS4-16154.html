			<p>BFN     [Text] Simferopol [no date as received] -- The Crimean  president's press service circulated a statement on 12 April  saying: "Kiev is trying to deprive the president and government  of Crimea of real power levers, take the militia, the Security  Service, communications, television and radio out of our  control, cram the peninsula with troops and military technology,  lower the Republic's status to that of an oblast, and smother  the Crimeans' will for independent and responsible  decisionmaking." The statement said the appointment of Ukraine's  presidential representative is regarded as an attempt to sow  seeds of discord in Crimea. The press service called on all  enterprise and organization managers to obey the decisions of  the president, Supreme Council, and government of Crimea  "without entering into contact with the illegally appointed  Ukraine's presidential representative in Crimea." The citizens  of Crimea are invited to express their attitude to this power  institution. In Yuriy Meshkov's opinion, Ukraine's moves are  aimed at preventing him from pursuing economic reforms and fully  restoring the Crimean Constitution.    A rally was held on the same day in support of Crimean  President Meshkov, and in the evening tents were set up by the  building of the Crimean Supreme Council at the initiative of  Russian Society leader Anatoliy Los and Oleksandr Kanafyev.  Crimea's political leaders said they were ready to take up arms  to defend Yuriy Meshkov and Crimea's state independence and  called on the people of Simferopol to bring warm clothes and  join the vigil at the tents. Some of the speakers said two  planes were due to arrive in Simferopol from Kiev carrying the  special task force, and no one knew what would happen; therefore  it was necessary to keep calm and resist the Ukrainian  leadership's provocations.    The night by the building of the Crimean Supreme Council  went  by uneventfully. Organizers did not say when the tents would be  taken down but promised they would be there as long as  necessary.</p>

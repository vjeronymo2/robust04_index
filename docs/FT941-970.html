			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Recession hits groups in Europe Japanese companies manufacturing in Europe were badly hit by the recession last year and their poor performance has led to a sharp fall in their investment plans. More than half the 728 Japanese manufacturing groups in Europe say they lost money last year and the operating results of 47 per cent of them deteriorated, according to a survey conducted by the Japan External Trade Organisation. The study showed that 83 per cent of companies had been hurt by the recession in Europe. More than a third had dismissed employees, scaled back their manufacturing plans or abandoned intended investments. Only 45 per cent of them intend to increase their investment, compared with 68 per cent in 1992. The UK remained the most popular location for new Japanese manufacturing investment, with nine companies setting up operations there, making a total of 206. Italy enjoyed the next largest increase, up seven to 52 companies. An additional two groups located in France, the second most popular country with 121 Japanese groups. However, Germany registered a fall, down two at 106, the first decline there since the survey began in 1983. The Netherlands also lost one company, leaving 45 groups there. The survey showed most Japanese companies believed they were benefiting from the single European market. Only 4 per cent viewed integration as negative. More than 62 per cent said customs procedures had been simplified, while 52 per cent reported their markets had grown, and 46 per cent had profited from lower distribution costs. However, 40 per cent said integration favoured European companies more than Japanese groups. More than 70 per cent of the companies polled said they obtained more than half of their parts or raw materials locally. This was partly because of the strength of the yen, and partly a fall in the prices of locally produced materials. About 57 per cent of Japanese companies had appointed a European as a director or in a higher post.  --------------------------------------------------------------------                 JAPANESE MANUFACTURERS BY COUNTRY*  --------------------------------------------------------------------              1985  1986  1987  1989  1990  1991  1992  1993  1994  -------------------------------------------------------------------- UK             32    53    68    91   129   175   189   197   206 France         30    33    33    81    89   106   115   119   121 Germany        35    46    54    65    87    99   106   108   106 Netherlands    16    20    19    27    33    36    44    46    45 Belgium        15    18    19    23    25    32    38    38    40 Luxembourg      0     0     0     0     2     2     3     3     3 Ireland        11    10    12    19    22    26    30    30    31 Spain          22    29    33    41    54    64    63    63    64 Italy           8    11    15    24    28    36    45    45    52 Finland         2     2     2     2     4     4     4     5     5 Norway          2     2     2     1     0     0     1     1     1 Sweden          1     1     3     6     6     6     9     9    10 Denmark         2     2     2     2     3     3     3     3     3 Austria         2     5     5     7    12    14    15    17    17 Portugal        7     6     6     7    13    13    13    12    12 Switzerland     0     1     1     4     5     7     7     9     8 Greece          4     4     4     4     3     3     3     3     3 Iceland         0     0     0     0     1     1     1     1     1  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Total         189   243   283   404   516   620   689   709   728  -------------------------------------------------------------------- *Excluding independent R&amp;D facilities.  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Japan External Trade Organisation  --------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PROPOSED METRO RAIL ASSESSMENTS CUT IN HALF  </P> <P> Mayor Bradley on Thursday announced a reduction of nearly 50% in the proposed  assessments to be levied against commercial property owners to pay for the  Metro Rail line from mid-Wilshire to North Hollywood.  </P> <P> "The reduction of the assessment will enable more property owners to more  easily contribute their fair share," Bradley said in announcing the reduction,  which applies to property owners in close proximity to 11 planned stations  along the 13.3-mile stretch.  </P> <P> The original assessment, set at 33 to 55 cents per square foot, will now cost  15 to 34 cents, Bradley said.  </P> <P> "I commend the community groups, the county and the RTD for coming together in  an action that will ultimately benefit property owners and the residents of  this city," he said.  </P> <P> The assessments, to be paid in 29 annual installments, will enable the RTD to  issue about $75 million in construction bonds over a seven-year period starting  in 1993.  </P></p>

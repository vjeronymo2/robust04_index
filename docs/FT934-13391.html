			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / UK Company News: St James's Place net assets improve 17.2% ST JAMES's Place Capital, Lord Rothschild's financial services group, reported a 17.2 per cent rise in net assets per share in the six months to September 30. As announced in July, the company is distributing to shareholders its 37.4 per cent holding in RIT Capital Partners, the investment trust managed by J. Rothschild Capital Management. In addition, St James's Place is distributing Pounds 32.7m of cash; at September 30 values, shareholders should receive 48.7p per share in a combination of shares and cash. St James's Place will be left with a range of financial services subsidiaries plus a portfolio of investments - J Rothschild Assurance (the life insurance group), Global Asset Management (29.7 per cent owned by Rothschild) and International Financial Markets Trading, both fund management groups, and J. Rothschild Wolfensohn, a 50:50 joint venture in boutique corporate finance with James Wolfensohn Inc. However, these businesses make up only Pounds 38m of St James's Place's Pounds 211m of assets. The remainder is invested in international bonds and equities, with a particular emphasis on German zero coupon bonds. Unrealised dealing gains of some Pounds 16.1m in the first half were a main reason for the rise in net assets to 126.2p a share, against 107.7p at the March 31 year-end. The directors announced last year that the company should be judged on a net asset, rather than a profit and loss basis. However, pre-tax profits doubled from Pounds 7m to Pounds 14.1m, helped by the elimination of both investment dealing losses and start-up costs at J. Rothschild Assurance. Earnings per share improved to 5.9p (3p) and the interim dividend is maintained at 1.5p. The company added: 'We continue to regard international equity markets with caution in view of the fragility of the apparent economic recovery in the US and the UK and the recessionary climate in Europe and Japan.' RIT Capital Partners also announced its results yesterday, revealing that net asset value had risen by 12 per cent to 202.9p a share over the six months to September 30. Total net assets were Pounds 398m at the end of September. Since March 31 RIT has sold more than three quarters of its interest in Newmont Mining, the gold mining group, realising about Pounds 114m. It has invested part of the proceeds in gold call options, a similar strategy to that followed by Sir James Goldsmith. As of September 30, RIT had a total portfolio of Pounds 468m of which Pounds 230m was in quoted equities, Pounds 61m in bonds, Pounds 91m in specialist funds, Pounds 63m in unquoted equities and Pounds 23m in property.</p>

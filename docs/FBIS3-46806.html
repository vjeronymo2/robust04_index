He said that Lieutenant General Chea Savan, secretary to  co-chief of staff Ke Kimyan, would represent the royalist  FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral,  Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] and General Ta Mok would  represent the Khmer Rouge. No independent confirmation was  immediately available.    The official said the planned meeting would follow secret  talks in Bangkok between the two sides, who were once allies in  a coalition against the Phnom Penh government set up by Vietnam.    There was no indication of participation by a member of the  Cambodian People's Party (CPP) which shares power in Phnom Penh  with FUNCINPEC following May elections. The Khmer Rouge, which  boycotted the elections, was understood to have offered a  ceasefire in exchange for posts in the Phnom Penh government.    Meanwhile, both the Cambodian government and the Khmer Rouge  continued to bring up reinforcements into western Cambodia where  three days of fighting at the New Year left almost 50 dead, the  Thai military said.    A trader arriving in the Thai border town of Aranyaprathet  Wednesday said he had seen long lines of military trucks  carrying arms on the 150-kilometer (90-mile) highway from  Battambang toward Poipet, especially around Sisophon. Both  sides were taking advantage of a two-day ceasefire Wednesday and  Thursday arranged by Thailand so that Thai troops could help  farmers to bring the rice crop in from the fields, military  officials said.    Late Wednesday afternoon, border patrol police reported one  shell landed on the Thai side of the border but said there was  no damage. There was no indication of significant clashes on the  Cambodian side.    In Poipet, Cambodian government Brigadier General Em Saray  said he had been ordered to launch an offensive against the  Khmer Rouge in late December. He said he was awaiting fresh  orders related to political developments as well as supplies of  ammunition.</p>

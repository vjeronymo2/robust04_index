			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Finance and the Family (Currencies in Crisis): A big sigh of relief - Mortgages IN THE wake of Wednesday's events, the reaction of those in the housing market has been to heave a sigh of relief - first, because we have been spared the catastrophe of mortgage interest rates at 13 or even 16 per cent and, second, because interest rates may now fall. Not everyone is euphoric. Fixed-rate mortgages at 10.4 per cent no longer have the glitter that they had on Wednesday. Those who dashed into Abbey National branches then to convert their mortgages into fixed rates of 10.35 per cent for seven years must now rue their decision. Peter White, chief executive of Alliance &amp; Leicester, the UK's fourth-largest building society, summed up the feelings of many lenders when he said that 'if the outcome of Wednesday is indeed lower rates, it has all been quite good news for the housing market.' A few lenders have already begun to offer mortgages with interest rates fixed below 10 per cent, and there will be a lot more of these in coming weeks. National Counties building society, for example, is offering a mortgage fixed at 9.75 per cent till September next year and then at 9.95 per cent for a further year. But I wonder if they will find many takers. Many economists believe base rates could fall to 8 per cent by Christmas, which would mean a mortgage rate of around 9 per cent. If building societies continue their attempts to stimulate the market, rates for first time buyers would be even lower. It is, however, too early to judge how far interest rates may fall, and the housing market is in such a mess that, whatever happens, it will take a good while to recover. Building society chiefs have been saying privately that September 1992 is the worst month they can remember in the property market. Even re-mortgage activity has virtually stopped. Meanwhile, house prices have continued to fall and 305,000 borrowers are more than six months behind with their mortgage payments. A sharp cut in interest rates, if it happens, might restore some consumer confidence and draw buyers back into the market, but the supply of houses for sale is likely to outstrip the number of buyers for months. Also, a partial recovery in the housing market may not be good news for homeowners with serious mortgage arrears. One reason why lenders have shown so much forbearance this year to those in trouble with their payments is that there was no point in putting even more houses on the market under present conditions. When the market improves, we shall see if lenders remain as sympathetic to their struggling mortgage customers. A further snag is that there will be very few 100 or 95 per cent loans around for first time buyers. The collapse of the mortgage indemnity guarantee market means that most would-be home-buyers will have to find a chunk of cash if they want to enter the housing market. For the short term, the prospect of a fall in rates might deter many would-be buyers from entering the market. 'People should stay calm and not take any decisions hastily. We do not yet know how things are going to settle down and it is too early to be very optimistic. The housing market's problems are so big that they are going to be with us for some time yet whatever happens,' says John Wriglesworth, a housing finance specialist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.</p>

			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Trade deficit narrows: Devaluation of sterling sharply boosts exports to non-EC countries BRITAIN'S visible trade deficit with countries outside the European Community narrowed again last month, amid fresh signs that the devaluation of sterling has given a sharp boost to British ex-ports. In April the value of imports from countries outside the EC exceeded the value of exports by Pounds 831m. However, the overall deficit was Pounds 98m less than in March. The better news on the trade balance was backed up by a sharp growth in export volumes in the past three months. The Central Statistical Office reported yesterday that total UK export volumes - excluding oil and erratic items such as ships and precious stones - had grown by 6 1/2 per cent compared with the previous 3 months. By contrast, imports rose by only 2 per cent over the same period. There has been an increase in exports to North America in the past month, and an improvement in the terms of trade with non-EC European countries. For the first time since May 1992, the UK registered a trade surplus with North America in April. UK traders registered a seasonally adjusted surplus of Pounds 85m compared with a deficit of Pounds 43m in March. Yesterday's figures were seen as a further indication that the devaluation of sterling is helping to promote economic recovery through the exports boost. Mr Kevin Gardiner, an economist at SG Warburg, said the figures suggested that the UK's gross domestic product would show an increase in the second quarter of this year. 'The UK is winning market share even though economies in the rest of Europe are slowing down,' he said. Since the beginning of the year, the CSO has not provided data for UK trade with European Community countries because a new system of measuring intra-EC trade is being introduced. When the March trade figures were released a month ago, the unit value index  -which is a method of measuring the cost of goods that are traded - showed a sharp rise between February and March. However, the figures show that export prices have returned to their levels at the start of the year, implying that exporters have not used the sterling devaluation as an opportunity to mark up prices.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- VALUE OF TRADE WITH NON-EC COUNTRIES Balance of payments basis seasonally adjusted (pounds m)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                Ex oil and erratics*              Exports   Imports   Balance   Exports   Imports   Balance  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1991          44,477    53,884    -9,407    38,289    45,252    -6,963 1992          46,573    56,510    -9,937    40,522    48,187    -7,665 1992 Q1       11,288    13,618    -2,330     9,382    11,550    -1,718      Q2       11,641    13,898    -2,257    10,106    11,820    -1,714      Q3       11,556    13,678    -2,122    10,048    11,676    -1,628      Q4       12,088    15,316    -3,228    10,536    13,141    -2,605 1993 Jan       4,345     5,399    -1,054     3,763     4,560      -797      Feb       4,459     5,709    -1,250     3,822     4,705      -883      Mar       4,702     5,631      -929     4,028     4,693      -665      Apr       4,685     5,516      -831     3,980     4,691      -711  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Defined as ships, aircraft, precious stones and silver  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

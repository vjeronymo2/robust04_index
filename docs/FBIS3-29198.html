Baysa] </F>   [Text] A top military official said yesterday he sees no  direct links between the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF)  and the Abu Sayaff, a breakaway group of the MNLF. "There is no  sufficient proof to show of a tie-up between the Abu Sayaff and  the MNLF. On the contrary, the Abu Sayaff is bent on sabotaging  the ongoing peace talks between the MNLF and the government,"  Brigadier General Rene S. Dado, AFP [Armed Forces of the  Philippines] Civil Relations Service (CRS) chief, said.    He urged the MNLF to stop giving refuge to Abu Sayaff  members  in their camps to express the MNLF disapproval of their acts of  terrorism. "By doing so, the Abu Sayaff will be completely  isolated and makes peace-loving and enlightened Muslims  happier," Dado added. The CRS chief traced the MNLF's generosity  to Abu Sayaff members to old ties among leaders of the two  groups. Dado said the Abu Sayaff has only 120 full-time members,  not 1,000 as earlier reported.    He denied reports on the guns smuggled in by the Abu Sayaff  "which could not be confirmed by military units in the area  where the arms landing was supposed to have taken place." He  said the Abu Sayaff has adopted a guerrilla strategy.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Algiers: Reports of Shabouti's Death </F> and Makhloufi's Murder"]    [Excerpts] Algiers, AL-HAYAH -- Algeria celebrated Labor  Day yesterday, days before the big march being prepared for to  support the dialogue for which President Liamine Zeroual has  called. The announcement of the formation of the Transitional  National Assembly (an unelected parliament) has been postponed  because of the major parties' refusal to participate in it.  [passage omitted]    It seems that Annaba was selected for Labor Day celebrations  to indicate that security forces are in control of the situation.    Southeastern areas of the capital witnessed large-scale  combing operations yesterday.    Information from various sources indicates that security  forces have killed prominent military leaders in the "armed  Islamic groups" or the "armed Islamic movement." There are  reports of the death of Major General Abdelkader Shabouti in  Chelif (west of Algeria). He was the leader of the "armed  Islamic movement" belonging to the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS].    AL-HAYAH has learned that Shabouti was in the Orous area  suffering from an undisclosed illness. He was moved to west  Algeria for treatment. Circles close to the FIS have not  confirmed Shabouti's death. Nor have there been any reports  that he has been "murdered." However, there are reports in some  Algerian circles about his death.    Other information indicates that Said Makhloufi was killed  "by mistake" during the recent siege imposed by security forces  on Boumerdas. He was holding a coordination meeting between the  armed Islamic groups and the armed Islamic movement.    The certain thing is that this information is still in the  hands of security men and FIS leaders. It might be announced in  the coming weeks. Some sources say the reason for neither  confirming nor denying the two FIS leaders' death is to avoid  obstructing current preparations for FIS supporters'  participation in the 8 May march in support of the dialogue  approach.

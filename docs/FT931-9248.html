			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Clinton versus the special interests Most pundits seem to regard President Bill Clinton's first few weeks as a failure. In fact, through a series of speeches, trial balloons and publicity stunts, he and his wife, Hillary, have begun to alter the terms of economic and social debate in quite significant ways. Distractions such as the debate over gays in the military and the prolonged (but now apparently successful) search for a female attorney-general have obscured the shrewd way in which the Clintons have prepared the ground for this Wednesday's crucial state of the union address to Congress. The principle of 'shared sacrifice', for example, already seems quite well-established. Contrary to his campaign rhetoric, Mr Clinton knows full well that he can reduce the deficit only by raising taxes on middle-income families and squeezing popular programmes such as Medicare, the federal health scheme for the elderly. He will try to make this seem politically acceptable in two ways: by stressing that short-term sacrifice is part of a strategy to boost growth by shifting resources from consumption to investment, and by emphasising the plan's 'fairness'. Starting tonight in a less formal television address, the nation will thus hear a lot from Mr Clinton about the so-called 'investment deficit' and the priority attached to raising spending in areas such as education, training and infrastructure. Middle-income families will also be told that they are being hit far less hard than other groups, such as rich individuals, companies and the federal bureaucracy. Mr Clinton has already announced a 25 per cent reduction in White House staff and a 5 per cent cut in federal employment over four years. On Wednesday he will propose a new 36 per cent top rate of income and corporation tax, and controversial limits on the tax deductibility of high executive salaries. The speech will be accompanied by 'burden tables' showing that the affluent are being asked to make much the biggest sacrifice. The other innovative aspect of Mr Clinton's approach is his recognition that serious economic and social reform can occur only if the influence of special interest groups is curbed. A permanent reduction in the budget deficit would benefit everybody because it would raise national savings and investment and hence the long-term rate of growth. It has not happened because interest groups, from the elderly to oil companies, oppose the specific spending cuts and tax increases that are needed. The story on health care is similar: private insurers oppose measures to prevent them weeding out sick people (bad risks); drug companies and physicians oppose controls that would reduce their incomes. Congress is subject to round-the-clock pressure from an army of talented lobbyists. This week's address will form part of an emerging White House strategy to bypass Congress, special interests and the media by speaking directly to the American people. In a televised 'townhall' meeting in Detroit last week Mr Clinton again demonstrated his ability to empathise with voters and explain complex issues simply. He spent an hour answering the public's questions, in the process defining what he saw as the 'national" interest in budgetary and social policy. Mrs Clinton is pursuing a similar strategy in her bid to bring about the radical reform of the US health care system. At a public meeting in Pennsylvania, she and Tipper Gore, the vice-president's wife, took on special interests by inviting uninsured families to discuss their medical and financial plight on national television. Later in the week both Clintons appeared at a clinic in Virginia and lambasted drug companies for profiteering at the expense of children. The cost of treatment is so high that nearly 50 per cent of two-year-olds are not vaccinated against common diseases. These powerful images set the scene for a call on Wednesday for the nation to pull together in tackling common problems. Yet the message may be blurred by Mr Clinton's apparent conviction that the economy still needs a short-term stimulus even though it is already growing at an annual rate of about 3 per cent. The stimulus is seen as politically invaluable because it fulfils a campaign pledge, is insurance against any future setbacks, and will later support Mr Clinton's claims that this is 'his recovery', rather than a legacy from the Bush years. With luck it may prove more apparent than real. For example, unless delayed well into next year, several tax changes - such as higher rates on top earners, higher taxation of pension benefits and the expected new energy levy -  should offset the stimulative impact of the investment tax credit and accelerated federal spending. Mr Clinton has begun to prepare people for the sacrifices needed to reduce the structural budget deficit. He must realise that he will never have greater room for manoeuvre. The economy is at the beginning of an upswing. Wall Street is in an unusually benign frame of mind. The Democratic party's electoral mandate to 'change America' is freshly minted. If he shirks tough measures now, he is certain to duck them as the next election draws closer. Special interests and congressional opposition will prevent him getting everything he asks for this week; the unforgivable mistake will be not to ask for enough.</p>

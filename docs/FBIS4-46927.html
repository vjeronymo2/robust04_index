			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Svetlana Gavrilina: "Will the Duma Help Russian </F> Science?"]    [Text] The St. Petersburg Union of Scientists,  jointly with the RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences] St.  Petersburg Scientific Center, invited Oksana Dmitriyeva, a  deputy of the State Duma and chairman of the budget  subcommittee, to a regular seminar from the cycle "Science and  Power." The topic of the discussion was phrased as follows: "The  Budget and Tax Policy With Regard to Science as a Result of  Activities of Certain Influence Groups Within the  Authorities."    The leader of the seminar, Sergey Kozyrev, vice president of  the St. Petersburg Union of Scientists, said that the desire to  learn "from the horse's mouth" what the authorities really  intend to undertake in order that the situation of science,  especially basic research, no longer be catastrophic was the  objective of the meeting.    The budget that was approved in the first reading calls for  allocating 3.5 trillion rubles [R] for science. This number with  many zeros is much smaller than the amount designated for  agrarians. What is to be done when funds are appropriated for  basic research that are only twice as large as those for  repairing the White House?    They asked Oksana Dmitriyeva this question: Does the Duma  understand that the irreversible decay of science in our country  is possible? The intellectual elite is migrating abroad, young  scientists are changing professions....    Dmitriyeva gave hope to the participants in the seminar by  stating that the situation whereby the Ministry of Finance  delayed the payment of money to scientific institutions would be  rectified. She mentioned the development of policy proposals in  this area jointly with the scholarly community as a direction  for the operation of her subcommittee. Oksana Dmitriyeva said  that it is necessary to seek a "transparent" budget for science,  and the Duma can resolve this issue.</p>

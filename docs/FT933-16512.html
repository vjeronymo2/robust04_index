			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / G7 meeting's success will hinge on tariff talks POLITICIANS and business leaders agreed yesterday that success or failure at next week's Group of Seven economic summit in Tokyo will hinge on the outcome next Tuesday of negotiations on tariff cuts in manufactures and services. A senior EC official said yesterday 'everything hinges' on quadrilateral talks involving the US, EC, Japan and Canada on tariff cuts. Quad officials have been negotiating all week in Toronto, and will report to a special ministerial meeting in Tokyo on Tuesday. This was hastily arranged last week after talks intended to hone a deal had floundered. Initial hopes that the Tokyo meeting might secure a substantial market access agreement to relaunch the long-stalled Uruguay Round of talks on global trade liberalisation have dimmed as France has hardened its opposition. The Japanese government, which faces elections in less than three weeks, may also be too weak to make tariff concessions, diplomats in Brussels say. Also in Brussels, Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, told colleagues France would insist on an end to bilateral and quadrilateral negotiations. He said the Uruguay Round talks had to be multilateralised. EC negotiators should operate in Geneva only with a mandate from the Council of Ministers of the Twelve. France won sympathy because of the hard line the US is taking over anti-dumping and countervailing duties on EC steel products, which the EC describes as 'wholly unjustified'. Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, tried to make light of the upcoming Quad meeting, insisting that the current market access negotiations were simply 'useful tools or pegs along the way' to a final agreement. In London, senior British officials said Mr John Major, the prime minister, would press hard for progress on the Uruguay Round. The prime minister yesterday met Mr Peter Sutherland, the new director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Officials said the meeting showed the UK was pushing 'very, very hard' for trade liberalisation even though Britain realised that there were big obstacles to progress. Leading business groups also pointed to the critical need for a Uruguay Round breakthrough in Tokyo. The Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce, which groups more than 100 leading companies across the world, said a successful outcome to the Uruguay Round was 'crucial and urgent. . . a litmus test of the political will and leadership of the G7.' In London, Sir David Plastow, chairman of the British-North American Research Association, which groups business, union, and academic leaders from both sides of the Atlantic, sent an open letter to Mr Major expressing deep concern over the lack of progress towards a Uruguay Round settlement: 'If the current negotiations fail, a unique opportunity to reform and modernise the world trading system will have been lost.' Mr Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz, secretary general of the Union of Industrial and Employers' Confederations (Unice), Europe's leading grouping of industrialists, noted in an open letter: 'Businesses are running out of time. Without effective and enforceable rules, protectionism will endanger global co-operation and trade.' Meanwhile, it was announced in Brussels that the EC delegation will not be led by Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, but by Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, prime minister of Belgium, which has just taken over the rotating EC presidency. A spokesman for Mr Delors said he had been advised by doctors to avoid a gruelling 12-hour trip to Tokyo because of recurring sciatica. But EC officials suggested that the Commission president 'might not be too unhappy' to miss a summit whose prospects for success have receded. The senior EC official offered a sober assessment of the prospects for a breakthrough, predicting however that 'everybody will turn up the pressure on Japan' to make concessions to reduce its trade surplus. This stood at Dollars 132bn (Pounds 88bn) last year, and is expected to rise further this year. Whitehall officials agree that next Tuesday's Quad talks will be crucial. The G7 summit itself, which begins on Wednesday, will not be the forum for negotiations, although Mr Major will want the G7 leaders to keep up the pressure for progress on trade.</p>

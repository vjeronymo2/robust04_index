			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / International Company News: Mill threat at Canadian pulp business STONE-Consolidated, the Canadian arm of Chicago's Stone Containers, is threatening to shut its Bathurst, New Brunswick, pulp and packaging paper mill unless the Canadian Paperworkers' Union accepts a tough survival plan. The dispute highlights the crisis in the eastern Canada pulp and paper industry after two years of depressed markets. One operation of the modern Bathurst mill normally ships to Stone-Consolidated's Bridgewater division at Ellesmere Port, in the UK, but was closed last November because of high inventory and poor prices. Two other similar mills in Quebec were also shut by other companies. The corrugated paper machine, however, continued to operate and Stone-Consolidated said it hoped to re-open the pulp mill this April if markets improved. Product prices, however, are still at record lows after accounting for inflation. The company asked the union to negotiate a survival package, including a 20 per cent reduction in wage costs. The plan would cut staff by 25 per cent. Stone Containers bought the former Consolidated-Bathurst from Power Corp of Canada in 1989 for CDollars 2.6bn (USDollars 2.2bn). The company is also a big newsprint producer, and its Quebec mills are planning to reduce operations early this spring.</p>

			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Malaysian attack on rubber consumers MALAYSIA, the world's third largest producer of natural rubber after Thailand and Indonesia, has strongly attacked the stand of rubber consumer countries concerning a new international rubber agreement. Mr Ahmad Farouk, leader of the Malaysian delegation to a recent meeting here of the International Natural Rubber Organisation said consumer countries could not expect producers to list all their proposals for a new rubber agreement before the consumers themselves had agreed that negotiations on a new agreement should take place. 'Never before in the history of commodity agreements have details been laid down before we go to the negotiating table' said Mr Farouk. After the recent Inro meeting consumers said they must see the producers' proposals for a new rubber agreement before making a decision on whether to proceed with negotiations. The present international rubber agreement runs out at the end of next year, though it can be extended by common agreement for a maximum period of two years. Mr Farouk said there was little point in agreeing to an extension of Inra 2 if there was no decision to negotiate on another rubber pact. 'What is the use of an extension if we decide not to renegotiate?' asked Mr Farouk. 'But if we agree on the need for a new agreement, then we can consider an extension to accommodate various procedures.' Meanwhile Mr Sucharit Promdej, the secretary general of the Association of Natural Rubber Producing Countries has said that his organisation is preparing itself for the possibility of a breakdown in negotiations for a new Inra. The ANRPC is due to meet in Thailand in early January to discuss new price measures. Mr Promdej said the ANRPC, which groups Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, India, Papua New Guinea and Singapore, would use supply adjustments and export quotas to stabilise natural rubber prices.</p>

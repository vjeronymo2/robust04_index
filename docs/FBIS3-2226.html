			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Geoffrey Crothall in Beijing and Daniel Kwan] </F>   [Excerpt] China's best-known dissident, Wei Jingsheng,  "voluntarily" left Beijing yesterday for an undisclosed  destination because of his "poor health", his secretary said  last night. Mr Wei, who had been detained by police for 24  hours two days ago, told his secretary Tong Yi that he would be  leaving Beijing for a few days and could not say when he would  be back.    Mr Wei had earlier in the day arranged to meet members of  the  foreign media to discuss his recent detention but at about 5 pm  told Ms Tong that he would be leaving the city with a few  friends for an undisclosed destination. Asked if she believed  Mr Wei's assertion he was leaving Beijing of his own free will,  Ms Tong said: "He is my boss. Of course, I believe him,"  adding that Mr Wei did appear to be "rather weary".    Most observers believe, however, that Mr Wei was persuaded  to  take an "all expenses paid vacation" by the police during his  detention last week, so that he would not be around during  United States Secretary of State Warren Christopher's visit to  Beijing on Friday.    Mr Wei's office in the northeast of Beijing was yesterday  surrounded by plainclothes police, who turned back journalists  hoping to interview the Democracy Wall veteran. Ms Tong, who  met Mr Wei after his release on Saturday, said that he did not  discuss with her what had happened during his detention but  stressed that he had not been formally arrested and had been  well treated.    As Mr Wei was leaving Beijing, the authorities' clampdown on  dissidents continued with the detention of another former  student leaders Zhai Weimin. Zhai was reportedly picked up in  Beijing's university district by four plainclothes police  officers and taken away for questioning. The former Beijing  Economics Institute student, who ranked sixth on the  Government's 1989 most wanted list, was released from jail last  September after serving a 3 1/2-year prison term for  "counter-revolutionary incitement and propaganda".    Meanwhile, one of the four dissidents rounded up in the  early  hours of Thursday morning was released apparently without being  charged yesterday morning. Qian Yumin, a member of Han  Dongfang's Autonomous Workers' Federation, was freed after being  warned to stay out of trouble during Mr Christopher's visit.  The other three dissidents arrested on Thursday -- Zhou  Guoqiang, Yuan Hongbing and Wang Jiaqi are understood to be  still in detention and face criminal charges. [passage omitted]</p>

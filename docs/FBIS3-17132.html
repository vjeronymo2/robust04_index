According to our Chisinau correspondent citing ITAR-TASS  agency, the Moscow proposals stipulate the establishment of a  special Dniester region with an own executive power, an elected  assembly, and a court of justice. The special region is to be  an inalienable part of the Republic of Moldova, but it will  bestowed with an important degree of self-administration.    The document also stipulates that in case the Republic of  Moldova decides to renounce its statehood and unite with another  country, the Dniester region is to be granted the right to  self-determination.</p>

			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BLIND HIKER GETS TO END OF TRAIL IN MAINE WOODS  </P> <P> Blind hiker Bill Irwin today completed his Appalachian Trail journey that began  eight months ago, making him the first blind person to hike the entire 2,167  miles.  </P> <P> About 60 people greeted him as he reached the end of the Georgia-to-Maine trail  at Katahdin Stream campground this morning, an official in remote Baxter State  Park said.  </P> <P> Irwin was joined by about 20 friends and reporters for the final 2.4-mile leg  of the journey, although he walked the last few hundred yards alone.  </P> <P> Irwin completed his trek under sunny skies with temperatures in the upper 30s.  </P> <P> In recent days, Irwin had hiked in snow and sleet, but today he got what  Carolyn Starling, a close friend, called "prayed-to-order weather."  </P> <P> Irwin, of Burlington, N.C., was accompanied by his guide dog Orient during the  epic journey.  </P> <P> Sponsors helped pay expenses for Irwin, a 50-year-old recovering alcoholic who  lost his sight to an eye disease when he was 28.  </P> <P> "I'm no great example of anything," he said in a recent interview. "Any blind  person that is capable could do the same thing if they wanted to go through the  same difficulty."  </P> <P> Since setting out from Georgia in March, Irwin has fallen dozens of times. He  has broken a rib, worn out equipment and coped with foul weather.  </P></p>

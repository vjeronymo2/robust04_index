			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Eduardo Calvo Sans: "The Enemy Is Argentina"; </F> first paragraph is LA PRENSA introduction]    [Excerpts] While all sorts of hazardous materials circulate  throughout the world, here in Argentina we still do not know  what to do with our own wastes or how to control them.    Argentina is supposedly safe from hazardous wastes coming  from other countries. In principle, a controversial law (24.051)  bans this, though some environmentalists say that its later  enacting regulation (Decree 831/93) leaves open a window through  which some wastes could be introduced, disguised as industrial  components.    It is a fact that throughout the world such materials are  "roaming around" in search of storage sites. It is the duty of  the authorities to keep their eyes open and their pockets shut.  [passage omitted]    For Argentina, the enemy is within.    Generators of hazardous wastes and unscrupulous waste  disposal contractors cannot be controlled. The unevenness of  legislation throughout Argentina, the inadequacy of the  organizations that are supposed to conduct controls, and the  lack of industrial facilities to process these materials place  the population at serious risk.    Tragic isolated events may suddenly make the problem  obvious.  The widespread feeling among specialists is that Argentina is  living on a time bomb, and there are no legal or political  mechanisms to dismantle this bomb.</p>

			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Nationwide again insured against losses Nationwide Anglia, the second largest building society, went for nearly eight months last year without an outside insurer for its mortgage losses after it ended a three year agreement with Sun Alliance in April. Mr Daniel Hodson, deputy chief executive, confirmed yesterday that the society has now signed a retrospective agreement with an insurance group who will in effect be insurers and reinsurers for its mortgage losses this year and next year. The agreement, an 'excess of loss' reinsurance agreement, was placed on the market in early December. Mr Hodson declined to say which group had won the contract. The arrangement with Sun Alliance was not renewed after it increased its premiums. Mr Hodson said yesterday that the new agreement was not necessarily very much more expensive, even though it came after a year of sharply increased arrears problems. He said the costs of the deal covering the past year were commensurate with those for the coming year, but admitted that the premium would be somewhat higher. During the period when it was not covered by an outside policy, Nationwide collected premiums from its customers to be paid when the new insurer was in place. Loan loss provisions last year were Pounds 94.8m.</p>

			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Mirror Group's latest issue FT-SE Index: 2,490.1 (+12.2) Pearson's decision not to bid for Mirror Group is discouraging for MGN shareholders but not fatal. It is now clear that Pounds 400m of pension fund assets are missing, plus Pounds 100m of cash: and Pounds 500m was MGN's market value at the time of its suspension. But it does not follow that MGN is worthless. Suppose, on a worst conceivable case, that the full Pounds 500m were irrecoverable and had to be replaced immediately. That would give rise to an interest bill of perhaps Pounds 55m a year. Since last year MGN made some Pounds 84m before tax, the remaining Pounds 29m would have a market value of Pounds 170m, assuming the same multiple as before. The reality would be less depressing. The pension fund was Pounds 150m in surplus, so the true deficit is only Pounds 250m. It is scarcely conceivable that the actuary to the scheme would require all of this to be made good in year one. Granted, a return even to normal funding would knock some Pounds 18m a year off MGN's profits, and there would be a further interest bill of Pounds 11m to replace the missing Pounds 100m in cash. But there seems little doubt that MGN is a viable business as it stands, particularly since the banks which own the majority of its shares have no obvious incentive to pull the plug. For minority shareholders, the position remains unsatisfactory. Precisely because MGN is healthy, its disposal is likely to be a low priority for the administrator. In the meantime, there seems no reason why the shares should not be traded again. The market may have no idea of the group's true liabilities, but neither has anyone else.</p>

			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian platinum sales 'up 41 per cent' in 1994 Imports of Russian platinum to the main western markets in 1994 are likely to be the second-highest on record at about 1.12m troy ounces, according to the CRU International consultancy group. This would be 41 per cent up from last year. 'This raises again the question of the real picture for Russian production, stocks and sales,' says Mr Tony Warwick-Ching, in CRU's Precious Metals Monitor. As production is clearly facing fresh problems because of the accident at the Norilsk complex - which supplies most of Russia's platinum group metals  -at the end of November, stock levels are increasingly important. 'The problem is that no-one seems to have a clear idea of what the Russians have in stock,' Mr Warwick-Ching points out. The Monitor shows that in the first ten months of 1994 Swiss imports of Russian platinum were 48 per cent higher than in the same period of 1993 at 297,000 ounces while, at 591,000 ounces, Japan's imports were 51 per cent up. 'Reported Russian deliveries to Germany, the US, Japan and Switzerland in the first nine months of the year have totalled over 820,000 ounces, already exceeding the figure for the whole of 1993.' Mr Warwick-Ching says the strength of Japanese demand 'remains puzzling'. Production of cars - big consumers of platinum in anti-pollution catalysts - in Japan is down by 10.7 per cent. However, platinum jewellery sales are robust because, while the dollar price of platinum has risen by 6.4 per cent since January, in yen terms it has fallen 6.2 per cent. He suggests the failure of the platinum price to react to 'the more bullish market perception of its fundamentals' is because of the tendency of some market players to link it closely to gold and silver in their computer-driven trading operations. CRU expects the price to remain above Dollars 400 but says it 'remains vulnerable to speculator sell-offs in the other precious metals.'

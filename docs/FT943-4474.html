			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / International Company News: ConsPress hit by new title launch costs Mr Kerry Packer's Australian Consolidated Press, the magazine publishing group, yesterday reported an 8.9 per cent fall in profits after tax and abnormal items in the year to end-June, at ADollars 55m (USDollars 41m). The result, which compared with ADollars 60.4m in the previous 12 months, was achieved on sales 2.5 per cent higher, at ADollars 415m. Fully diluted earnings per share fell to 31.7 cents, from 34.7 cents. The 1993-94 earnings figure was depressed by a ADollars 9.3m abnormal item, compared with no abnormals in the previous year. This, according to ConsPress, related to 'losses incurred on the development of new titles'. There has been a large number of new launches in the highly competitive Australian 'mass women's' market recently. Even at the operating level, before tax and abnormals, profits were lower at ADollars 91.3m compared with ADollars 98.9m last time - although ConsPress said the previous year included a one-off gain of ADollars 4.7m due to accounting-related changes and ADollars 1.5m from a controlled entity, Offset Alpine, which had since been shed. It added that existing titles saw revenue grow by about 4 per cent last year, with circulation revenue rising by 3 per cent and advertising revenue by 6 per cent. However, profit from these titles fell by 1.5 per cent, as a result of higher editorial and promotional costs plus the expenses of establishing its Singapore operation. The company sounded a more encouraging note about the current year, however, saying that it had budgeted for an increase in earnings before interest, tax and abnormals of approximately 10 per cent. ConsPress added that the merger, already announced, with Nine Network - another Packer company - was due to take effect on November 8. The merger depends on shareholder approval.</p>

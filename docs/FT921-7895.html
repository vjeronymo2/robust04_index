			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / International Company News: Occidental to reduce stake in Canada as part of restructuring OCCIDENTAL Petroleum, of Los Angeles, is selling up to half its 48 per cent stake in its Canadian subsidiary as part of a restructuring to reduce its debt burden. Canoxy, which is based in Calgary, filed a preliminary prospectus yesterday for its US parent to sell about 12m Canoxy common shares to a syndicate of Canadian underwriters led by RBC Dominion Securities. The shares are being offered to the public on an instalment receipt basis at a price of CDollars 25.75 a share. Canoxy's share price dropped by CDollars 2.50 to CDollars 25 on the Toronto Stock Exchange immediately after the announcement. In addition, the underwriters had an option until late yesterday afternoon to buy an additional 4m shares. Occidental's ownership will drop to 24 per cent if all 16m shares are sold. The US company said it had no plans to sell its remaining shares in Canoxy. It will continue to have four representatives on the Canoxy board, and business arrangements with the Canadian company will not be affected, including co-operation in a project in Yemen. Canoxy separately reported 1991 net income of CDollars 23.1m (Dollars 19.4m), or 35 cents a share, down from CDollars 31.6m, or 47 cents, in 1990. Dominion Textile, Canada's only surviving integrated textile group, is phasing out its fabrics weaving and finishing plants in eastern Ontario and Quebec because of persistent losses and the recession's drastic impact on the clothing industry, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. About 600 jobs will be lost by mid-year. The company said the fabrics shutdown was part of a broad restructuring under which activities in Canada were being reduced and emphasis was being put on expansion in the US, Europe, North Africa and south-east Asia.</p>

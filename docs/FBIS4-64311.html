			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "European Union: Italy Told To </F> Respect Steel Commitments"]    [Text] (ANSA) Brussels, April 27 -- The European Commission  has warned Italy that it must respect commitments made to  restructure its steel sector, in exchange for a European Union  green light on state aid to Ilva, or face new sanctions.    The veiled threat was contained in the report the European  Union executive presented here today on the state of  restructuring plans by European public steel concerns, approved  by the European Industry Council last December.    The warning was also aimed, sources at the European  Commission said, at Germany and its plan for Ekostahl, and  Spain's plan for CIS.    Karel van Miert, the European Commissioner responsible for  competition, on Wednesday [27 April] stressed the need to have  "all information necessary, from interested countries, to verify  progress made in the restructuring plans for which state aid has  been authorized. The overall credibility of the plans, in fact,  will depend on the respect of these conditions." Van Miert went  on to say that not all countries in question have offered the  full data requested in the time required.    This question was already raised by the European Commission  last week, during the Industry Council in Luxembourg, at which  time Italian Foreign Trade Minister Paolo Baratta promised to  promptly forward lacking data from IRI [Institute for Italian  Reconstruction] on the application of the Ilva plan. He also  reiterated Italy's determination to respect the commitments made  last December on the time-table and methods to restructure the  country's public steel sector.    Nations in the process of restructuring their public steel  companies were to have forwarded to the European Commission, by  March 15, data on the reduction of production capacity,  investments, job cuts, market conditions, financial results and  on privatization drives.    The plan the European Union approved for Ilva foresaw the  closure in Taranto, by the end of June, of two blast furnaces,  for a production cut of 1.2 million tons, and a further 500 ton  cut through the sale of ILP. The plan also called for the total  dismantling of the Bagnoli plant, outside Naples, while the  sales if ILP and AST must take place before the end of the  current year.</p>
